  "title": "Pro Bankruptcy Briefing: Met Museum Drops Sackler Name; Bronx Property Put on Auction Block",
  "text": "<p>Top News</p><p>The Met will remove Sackler name. Seven museum exhibition spaces at the Metropolitan Museum of Art will no longer bear the name Sackler, the family who owns OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP and have faced intense scrutiny over the company's role in the U.S. opioid crisis. The spaces affected by the change include the Sackler Wing, which houses Egyptian art and contains the famous Temple of Dendur.</p><p>Purdue's OxyContin, which was approved by U.S. regulators in 1995, became the company's breakthrough product—and has in recent years been at the center of hundreds of lawsuits accusing the company of helping to spark a public-health crisis in America. Members of the Sackler family who own Purdue have denied wrongdoing and agreed to a roughly $4.5 billion settlement in the company's chapter 11 bankruptcy case.</p><p>Bronx property sent to chapter 11 auction as developers' buyout stalls. A bankruptcy judge in New York put a bankrupt real-estate project in the Bronx up for auction, rejecting efforts by the site developers to regain control through a private deal and dismissal of the chapter 11 case. Judge Lisa Beckerman of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan said chapter 11 law didn't allow for a proposed $12.5 million buyout of a vacant site at 286 Rider Avenue by its developers, the real-estate investors Toby Moskovits and Michael Lichtenstein.</p><p>The developers' request required the consent of the property owner, which they own but don't control. Instead, the judge set a sale process in motion at a secured lender's request, despite objections from the developers that a rushed sale would chill bidding.</p><p>Economy</p><p>U.S. inflation likely hit 39-year high last month. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimate the Labor Department will report the consumer-price index—which measures what consumers pay for goods and services—rose 6.7% in November from the same month a year ago. That would mark the fastest pace since 1982 and the sixth straight month in which inflation topped 5%.</p><p>\"These are frighteningly high inflation numbers, the likes of which we haven't seen for decades.\"</p><p>— Allen Sinai, chief global economist and strategist at Decision Economics Inc.</p><p>Bankruptcy</p><p>U.S. bankruptcy monitor challenges Jones Day's role in J&amp;J talc case. A Justice Department bankruptcy watchdog challenged a Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary over its request to hire Jones Day for its chapter 11 case. J&amp;J subsidiary LTL Management LLC wants Jones Day to represent it in a bankruptcy case it filed earlier this year to resolve personal injury lawsuits alleging J&amp;J talc products caused cancer or other injuries, which the company denies.</p><p>The Justice Department's Office of the U.S. Trustee said in an objection in New Jersey bankruptcy court that Jones Day could have professional conflicts because the firm has represented the publicly-traded parent company and a former corporate affiliate on restructuring matters related to talc liabilities.</p><p>Those corporate entities may have interests averse to the bankrupt unit Jones Day now represents, according to the objection. Companies that file chapter 11 must get approval from a bankruptcy judge for the law firm they retain to represent them. A J&amp;J spokeswoman declined comment. — Jonathan Randles</p><p>‘The One' megamansion developer secures $12 million bankruptcy loan. The developer of \"The One\" megamansion in Bel-Air has lined up a $12 million bankruptcy loan as it seeks to sell the property in chapter 11.</p><p>The proposed financing comes from existing lender Hankey Capital LLC and will be used to complete work on the property, according to court papers filed Wednesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles.</p><p>Real-estate developer Nile Niami put a company that owns The One into chapter 11 in October amid disputes with lenders.
