  "title": "Drugmaker Endo Says Bankruptcy Likely Imminent; The drugmaker has been in talks with lenders, but also faces thousands of lawsuits from government and private plaintiffs alleging it fueled opioid addiction",
  "text": "<p>The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Endo was moving toward filing for bankruptcy without a comprehensive agreement in place with the various states, municipalities and private plaintiffs suing the company for its role in producing and distributing opioids.</p><p>Endo, domiciled in Ireland with operations in Malvern, Pa., has been grappling for years against opioid-related lawsuits from state and local governments over its painkiller Opana. The company, which has denied liability in connection with the opioid crisis, discontinued Opana in 2017 at the request of the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Endo has reached piecemeal settlements over opioid claims with states including Florida, Texas, New York, West Virginia and Alabama. But it still faces about 3,500 lawsuits from state and local governments, private healthcare providers and individuals. The company has also been struggling under $8 billion of debt as earnings declined in part driven by the loss of exclusivity for a key drug, Vasostrict.</p><p>Other pharmaceutical companies have entered bankruptcy after they agreed to settle with their opioid claimants. Purdue Pharma LP and Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals both filed for chapter 11 in recent years under the pressure of opioid-related lawsuits. Both have filed for bankruptcy with agreements with state attorneys general and local governments.</p><p>Filing for bankruptcy typically gives companies more tools to fight civil litigation. Under chapter 11, the court halts lawsuits.</p><p>In Endo's case, creditors of nearly $7 billion of the company's total $8 billion debt would be paid out ahead of opioid plaintiffs in bankruptcy. That could shrink the pot that would otherwise go to opioid plaintiffs and set off fierce fights with state and local governments as well as private health systems.</p><p>These fights could lead to a drawn-out and costly bankruptcy process because Endo will need to reach deals with enough opioid plaintiffs before it can convince the bankruptcy court to sign off on its reorganization plan.</p><p>Endo, along with drug manufacturers Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Johnson &amp; Johnson, scored a rare win against local governments in Southern California late last year that had sued over their roles in the opioid crisis. The plaintiffs have appealed the judge's decision, which said the governments had failed to prove their case.</p><p>Write to Alexander Gladstone at alexander.gladstone@wsj.com and Soma Biswas at soma.biswas@wsj.com</p><p>Drugmaker Endo Says Bankruptcy Likely Imminent</p>",
