  "text": "<p>Investors are watching the final economic reports of this calendar year, including a weekly U.S. update on those seeking unemployment insurance benefits, which held at a 52 year low.</p><p>Sign up for our Market Watch Newsletters&#xa0;here.</p><p>How are stock benchmarks performing?</p><p>Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial AverageYMH22YM00were edging up 50 points, or 0.1%, to 36,431.</p><p>S&amp;P 500 index futuresESH22ES00were trading 8.75 points, or 0.2%, to trade at 4,793.25.</p><p>Nasdaq-100 futuresNQH22NQ00advanced 43.50 points to reach 16,534, a gain of 0.3%.</p><p>On Wednesday, the DowDJIA rose 90.42 points, or 0.3%, ending at a record 36,488.63, and marking its 45th record close of 2021; the S&amp;P 500 index SPX&#xa0;gained 6.71 points, or 0.1%, finishing at a record 4,793.06, for its 70th record close of 2021. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, however, shed 15.51 points, or 0.1%, closing at 15,766.22.</p><p>The week, month and year</p><p>For the week, the Dow is headed for a gain of 1.5%, the S&amp;P 500 are looking at a 1.4%, the Nasdaq Composite was looking at a 0.7% rise over the period. For the month and year, the Dow was on track for 5.8% rise in December and a 19.2% gain for 2021, the S&amp;P 500 is looking at a 5% for the month so far and a 28.4% gain in the year to date, while the Nasdaq Composite was up 1.5% on the month and 22.5% in 2021.</p><p>What's driving the market?</p><p>U.S. stock-index futures edged higher in early trading, after the S&amp;P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at new records Wednesday, with a report showing that labor shortages and a demand for workers are overshadowing concerns about omicron at the moment.</p><p>U.S. Labor Department data show that 198,000 applied for unemployment benefits during the week ended Dec. 25, leaving new jobless claims around a 52-year low amid the spread of omicron.</p><p>Initial jobless claims fell slightly from a revised 206,000 two weeks ago,&#xa0;based on new government data. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast new claims to total a seasonally adjusted 205,000.</p><p>Along with jobless claims evidence in recent weeks suggests that the omicron variant of COVID, with preliminary data showing it results in milder symptoms than earlier strains of coronavirus, hasn't dented key parts of the economy yet.</p><p>The number of Americans now in the hospital with COVID-19 is running at around 60,000, or about half the figure seen in January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported, even though new daily cases are at a record.</p><p>It's unlikely that hospitalization numbers will ever rise to their previous peak, Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School Public Health, told the Associated Press. Vaccines and treatments developed since last year have made it easier to curb the spread of the virus and minimize serious effects among people with breakthrough infections.</p><p>“Its going to take some time for people to get attuned to the fact that cases don't matter the same way they did in the past,” Adalja said. “We have a lot of defense against it.” But even with fewer people hospitalized compared with past surges, the virus can wreak havoc on hospitals and healthcare workers, he added.</p><p>In addition, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ&#xa0;said Thursday that a South African Phase 3 study showed that its booster shot of its vaccine was 85% effective in preventing COVID-19-related hospitalization.</p><p>Beyond the joblessness data, investors also are watching for a report on manufacturing activity in the Chicago area for December. Chicago PMI's are set to come in at 62, up from 61.8 in the previous month. The data is scheduled to be released at 9:45 a.m. There will be no data on Friday in observance of the New Year's holiday.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Shares of&#xa0;BiogenBIIB&#xa0;were headed lower after Korea-based&#xa0;Samsung BiologicsKR:207940&#xa0;called a media report that it was about to buy the company “not true.”&#xa0;</p><p>U.S.-listed shares of&#xa0;Didi GlobalDIDI&#xa0;were headed lower premarket after the ride-hailing firm&#xa0;said its third-quarter revenue dropped.</p><p>How are other assets faring?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note&#xa0;TMUBMUSD10Y&#xa0;was at 1.53%, down by 1 basis points but still hanging around its highest since Nov. 24, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
