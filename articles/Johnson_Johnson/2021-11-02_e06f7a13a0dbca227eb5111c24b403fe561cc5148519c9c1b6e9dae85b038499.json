  "text": "<p>   A California judge cleared four drugmakers of liability after a monthslong trial accusing the companies, including Johnson &amp; Johnson and Endo International PLC, of causing widespread opioid addiction in the state. </p><p>   The ruling, issued Monday in Superior Court in Orange County, is a rare win for drug companies that make and distribute prescription painkillers in litigation seeking to blame them for the opioid epidemic. </p><p>   The California lawsuit, filed in 2014, was one of the first of thousands of similar actions filed by states, local governments and Native American tribes. The litigation broadly alleges that drugmakers manufactured powerful painkillers too broadly and that distributors didn't do enough to halt shipments that went beyond communities' medical needs. </p><p>   The governments have been seeking to win money to address the harms of opioid addiction. The four plaintiffs in the California case, the counties of Orange, Santa Clara and Los Angeles and the city of Oakland, had hoped to be awarded billions of dollars. </p><p>   Prescription and illegal opioids have killed nearly 500,000 people since 1999, according to federal data. </p><p>   The companies have argued that they aren't responsible for causing widespread opioid addiction and made federally regulated products that helped people in pain. Three large distributors and Johnson &amp; Johnson recently agreed to pay as much as $26 billion to settle most lawsuits they face. </p><p>   In ruling for the companies, Judge Peter Wilson said his conclusions addressed the question of liability, \"and are in no manner intended to ignore or minimize the existence and extent of the ongoing opioid crisis.\" He wrote that he disagreed with the plaintiffs' premise that they could prove their case by showing the number of opioid prescriptions increased, without having to show how many were medically unnecessary. </p><p>   The ruling is considered tentative. Final rulings in California usually reflect the same conclusions. </p><p>   Johnson &amp; Johnson said the decision reflects that its marketing and promotion \"were appropriate and reasonable.\" Endo said its \"lawful conduct did not cause the widespread public nuisance\" at issue in the suit. </p><p>   A group of plaintiffs' lawyers that has led the opioid litigation nationally said an appeal can be pursued. </p><p></p>",
