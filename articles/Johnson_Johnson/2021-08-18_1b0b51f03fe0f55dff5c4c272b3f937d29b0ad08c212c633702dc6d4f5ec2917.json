  "text": "<p>The Biden administration plans to start offering Americans a third dose of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines next month amid a wave of new cases tied to the Delta coronavirus variant, after government scientists concluded booster shots were needed to stem another outbreak.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0818-covid-19-booster-shots.html\">a joint statement </a>published on Wednesday, the heads of the US government's leading health agencies, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, said Washington was “prepared to offer booster shots for all Americans” eight months after their second dose. The boosters would become available from September 20.</p> <p>The decision comes as the US battles a fresh wave of Covid cases, with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/201e6f04-342a-4131-8150-b618ba448901\">the more contagious Delta variant</a> spreading rapidly in several states, particularly among people who have not received any jabs. </p> <p>The health officials, including the US surgeon general Vivek Murthy and Anthony Fauci, Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, said those at the front of the queue for boosters would include healthcare providers, nursing home residents and other senior citizens who had been among the first to receive jabs.</p> <p>The officials said the boosters were subject to formal approval by both the FDA and the CDC, which are reviewing the evidence on the safety and effectiveness of a third jab of the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines.</p> <p>The statement noted that the administration of the single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine only began in the US in March, and while officials said they “anticipate” boosters would also be needed for J&amp;J recipients, they were continuing to review the available data and would “keep the public informed with a timely plan for J&amp;J booster shots as well”.</p> <p>“Our top priority remains staying ahead of the virus and protecting the American people from Covid-19 with safe, effective and long-lasting vaccines, especially in the context of a constantly changing virus and epidemiologic landscape,” the health officials said. </p> <p>“We will continue to follow the science on a daily basis, and we are prepared to modify this plan should new data emerge that requires it.”</p> <p>The World Health Organisation questioned the US decision, saying the current data “does not indicate that boosters are needed”.<br></p> <p>Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme, criticised the US for allocating third jabs for Americans when so many other countries were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf12e1ba-ee25-4a0a-870d-53f5b66b0996\">struggling with a lack of vaccine supply</a>.</p> <p>“The reality is, right now, today, if we think of this in terms of an analogy, we're planning to hand out extra life jackets to people who already have life jackets, while we're leaving other people to drown without a single life jacket,” Ryan said. “That's the reality.”</p> <p>Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus response co-ordinator, pushed back against the criticisms, telling reporters that in June and July, the US administered 50m shots to Americans while at the same time shipping over 100m doses to other countries. </p> <p>Zients said the US intended to donate more than 200m additional doses to the rest of the world in the coming months.</p> <p>“To end this pandemic, we have to protect the American people, and we have to continue to do more and more to vaccinate the world. Both are critical,” Zients said. “We are already proving that we can protect our own people here at home as we help others.”</p><p>Source: Lauren Fedor in Washington and Mamta Badkar in New York 2021 'US to begin offering Covid booster shots from next month' FT.com 18 August.
