  "title": "Larry Fink Wants  To Save the World  ---  BlackRock CEO pushes firms to address  climate change; it's a job not all say is his  ----  By Dawn Lim",
  "text": "<p>   Few private citizens wield more power in America today than Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock Inc. In pushing companies to embrace climate-friendly policies, that has made him a lightning rod. </p><p>   The firm he runs manages some $10 trillion for pension funds, endowments, governments, companies and individuals, equal to more than 10% of the world's gross domestic product in 2020. Its funds are among the three largest shareholders in more than 80% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>   As steward for millions of investors, BlackRock wields vast shareholder voting power, which it uses either to back managements or to prod them in new directions. </p><p>   Today, Mr. Fink is telling CEOs that companies must prepare for a scaleback of fossil fuels, and that the private sector should work with governments to do so. He warns of the disruption climate change could cause both the economy and financial markets, but sees historic investment opportunity in the energy shift. </p><p>   \"This is the beginning of a long but rapidly accelerating transition -- one that will unfold over many years and reshape asset prices of every type,\" he said in a letter to CEOs last year. </p><p>   Mr. Fink's power, combined with his advocacy on a hot-button issue, has made him a flashpoint for activists, politicians and unions, both those who think BlackRock isn't doing enough and others who say it's doing too much. </p><p>   Five Democratic senators wrote to Mr. Fink in 2020 saying BlackRock needed to support more shareholder resolutions to match his promises. </p><p>   Tariq Fancy, an ex-BlackRock executive who runs an educational nonprofit, said Mr. Fink's message is distracting people from more-dramatic steps Mr. Fancy thinks necessary, such as carbon taxes. </p><p>   \"It's like giving wheatgrass to a cancer patient,\" he said. \"The false promise of this wheatgrass serves to delay the onset of the more painful, yet necessary, solutions.\" </p><p>   Hanging over the discussion is the argument that Mr. Fink is taking on a role better left to elected representatives. </p><p>   In mid-2021, two Republican senators wrote to a large 401(k)-type plan expressing concern BlackRock was putting its CEO's views ahead of investors' needs and infusing left-leaning priorities in its voting guidelines. </p><p>   Real-estate investor Sam Zell said to CNBC a few years ago: \"I didn't know Larry Fink had been made God.\" </p><p>   Mr. Fink says BlackRock acts as a voice for its investors. Mr. Fink, who describes himself as a conservative Democrat, says he isn't being political when he says investors and businesses should work alongside the government to address broad problems. When companies play a role, he says, they reduce the need for governments to engage in deficit spending to tackle the issues. </p><p>   \"I believe in the power of American capitalism,\" Mr. Fink said. \"Progressives don't believe deficits matter. I do.\" </p><p>   Mr. Fink says companies that embrace their responsibilities in crises can fulfill a role in society while delivering returns. In an interview at his horse farm in Westchester County, north of New York City, he brought up an example from the previous century. </p><p>   \"See what Johnson &amp; Johnson did in World War I and II,\" he said. \"You can call them opportunists by providing Band-Aids and gauzes and all that stuff to the military, but they were there during the crisis and stood there.\" </p><p>   BlackRock, he says, can help investors by offering funds focused on environmental, social, and governance-minded investing, plus software to gauge climate-related risks such as drought and floods. In 2020, he told CEOs BlackRock would be increasingly disposed to vote against boards and companies that don't report their climate risks in formats BlackRock endorses. </p><p>   Mr. Fink also presses firms to disclose more on the social effects of their business, such as the welfare of their workers or their local communities. </p><p>   Mr. Fink's prominence partly reflects changes in finance, including a move toward index funds. That in turn has shifted the dynamic in boardrooms to give power to large asset managers. </p><p>   \"Treasury Secretaries and finance ministers come and go,\" said David Rubenstein, co-founder of Carlyle Group Inc. \"They work for someone else who can fire them tomorrow and have to build what others want them to. When you are the CEO of the biggest asset manager, you don't have to.\" </p><p>   Laurence Fink got his start at First Boston, where he ran a desk that pooled mortgages and other loans and sold pieces of the bundles. Investors snapped up safe tranches, but the riskiest stayed on the bank's balance sheet. When interest rates fell in 1986, his desk lost $100 million. Mr. Fink was forced to leave. </p><p>   He founded BlackRock two years later with trader Rob Kapito and six others. It lured investors with the pitch that it had the same risk technology as big banks but without conflicts they sometimes had. </p><p>   In March 2008, as the housing bubble began deflating, New York Fed President Tim Geithner and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson asked Mr. Fink for help as they scrambled to forestall a messy collapse of the bank Bear Stearns. </p><p>   They wanted Bear to be absorbed by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. but it worried about Bear's rapidly souring mortgage assets. The officials asked Mr. Fink: If the Fed provided financing for a newly formed company that would absorb Bear's bad assets, was there a reasonable chance the collateral could cover the loan? </p><p>   Mr. Fink told them taxpayers wouldn't lose money over the long run. U.S. officials moved the bad assets to a limited-liability company financed by the Fed so JPMorgan could be comfortable taking over Bear, which it did. BlackRock helped select which assets went into the LLC portfolio and oversaw it for the government. That program ultimately delivered gains for taxpayers. </p><p>   \"Larry was perfect for this job,\" Mr. Paulson said. \"No one understood the market better.\" </p><p>   Roughly a year later, BlackRock got a chance to acquire Barclays PLC's money-management business. Mr. Fink held his first grandchild in his arms in June 2009 and then went to the office for an all-nighter to raise the final $3 billion to buy Barclays Global Investors. </p><p>   The deal gave BlackRock an arsenal of index-mirroring funds with low fees. It also gave Mr. Fink a megaphone. He decided the firm needed to be a counterweight to activist investors who target companies. \"There needed to be a louder voice for long-term investors,\" he said. </p><p>   BlackRock in 2012 released the first of Mr. Fink's annual letters to CEOs. He uses these to prod, scold and push firms to disclose more about how they provide for workers, the environment and the community. \"Climate risk is investment risk,\" Mr. Fink has written. Also, \"Profits and purpose are inextricably linked.\" </p><p>   For much of his career, Mr. Fink was known for arriving at the office by 6 a.m., while traveling two weeks a month. He now starts his workday about 7:30 following a session with a trainer. His back feels the toll from years of desk work, said Mr. Fink, who is 69. </p><p>   BlackRock's board and executives, in succession planning, recently asked Mr. Fink to continue as CEO. He said he is planning to retire in no more than five years. </p><p>   As a CEO, he can be impatient, colleagues say, and hates to be beaten. When Fidelity Investments in 2018 shook the money-management business by offering zero-fee index funds, Mr. Fink called a meeting and told his teams to pick up the phone and put BlackRock's name in front of clients. </p><p>   \"Stop tripping over your d--ks,\" he demanded, according to several people at the meeting. </p><p>   On March 18, 2020, with Covid-19 spreading, stocks falling and bond trading seizing up, Mr. Fink got another summons to Washington. </p><p>   Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin organized a meeting, hoping the conversation would make clear to then-President Donald Trump that a government response to the pandemic needed to be big. The group discussed how much the government should spend to keep the economy afloat. \"Trillions,\" Mr. Fink said. </p><p>   The government soon unveiled a roughly $2 trillion package, part of it to prop up financial markets. A formal role for BlackRock wasn't discussed at the meeting, but soon the Fed hired a BlackRock unit to help it pump money into corporate bonds -- a first for the central bank -- and other markets. The financial markets stabilized. </p><p>   Part of BlackRock's assignment was helping the Fed buy bond exchange-traded funds, including BlackRock's own. In the rush to avert a deep recession, the Fed didn't bid out the job but just hired BlackRock. </p><p>   The firm estimates it lost money on the work, given the resources consumed, said people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Mr. Fink has cut back his travel in the pandemic but invites one or two CEOs a week to his Manhattan townhouse for dinner. He says they order take-out and do the dishes afterward. He spends Thursday evenings to Sunday afternoons at his farm, where he has installed a desk in a barn filled with American folk art. </p><p>   There, he has planted some 400 American chestnuts and other trees. He gets excited as he identifies each species. </p><p>   Through the day, the duck ringtone on his cellphone goes off. When company executives phone to try to persuade him how to handle proxy votes, Mr. Fink hands them to a BlackRock group that interacts with companies. Though he is in discussions on rules guiding the firm's votes, he removes himself from decisions on any one vote. </p><p>   In 2017, Mr. Fink was part of a group of CEOs serving as a sounding board for former President Trump on business policies. After the racially motivated and violent clash in Charlottesville, Va., that year, Mr. Fink huddled with another member, PepsiCo Inc.'s then-CEO Indra Nooyi, over what both considered Mr. Trump's insufficient condemnation of those behind the violence, and the two decided to step down from the group. Some other CEOs arrived at the same position, leading the president to dissolve it. </p><p></p>",
