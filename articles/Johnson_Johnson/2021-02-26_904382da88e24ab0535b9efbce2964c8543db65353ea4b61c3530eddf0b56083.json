Take our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2021-02-26/\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Joe Biden's hopes of including a federal minimum wage increase in his $1.9tn stimulus plan were dealt a setback when the Senate's parliamentarian ruled that it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8ad48f8-6730-4814-b8ea-ec3ce79cbe83\">could not be approved by a simple majority</a> in the upper chamber of Congress. </p> <p>The decision came on the eve of a vote in the House of Representatives as early as Friday to approve the US president's package, which will deliver a big fiscal jolt to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fd96a32-da98-4f31-8936-8f3699200652\">US economic recovery</a>. </p> <p>The House version of the relief legislation includes an increase in the federal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour, one of Biden's top priorities that he shares with many progressive Democratic lawmakers. </p> <p>But even if the full plan passes the House, the minimum wage increase will have to be stripped from the legislation in the Senate, complicating the political calculations for the White House and congressional Democrats. </p> <p>An increase <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22ed8f6a-53e0-410e-8b02-3a5b51b4e974\">has been championed</a> by the White House and many Democrats as a matter of economic equity, particularly to help low-wage workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans say it would have an adverse effect on employment.<br><br>The ruling threatens to raise tensions between the White House and the left of the Democratic party, since some progressive lawmakers have called on Biden to overrule the parliamentarian — a move that the new administration is not inclined to do.
