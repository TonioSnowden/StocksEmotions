  "text": "<p>   The idea was to employ Ad26 to carry DNA into human cells to instruct them make their own spike protein. That would trigger production of immune-system antibodies to fight off the actual virus in a vaccinated person, by binding to the spike protein and preventing it from entering cells. </p><p>   By the end of January, Dr. Barouch got in touch with J&amp;J researchers, and within a few days, they came up with about a dozen vaccine designs. Two months later, they landed on one candidate the company planned to test in animal and human studies, said Hanneke Schuitemaker, head of viral vaccine discovery at J&amp;J. </p><p>   In an early test, researchers at a contract laboratory in Maryland vaccinated rhesus macaques with J&amp;J's experimental shot, and, six weeks later, exposed them to the coronavirus. </p><p>   After putting his children to bed on a Friday night in May, Dr. Barouch settled into his home office and opened an email with the results: After a single dose, there was no detectable virus in specimens from the lungs of all of the monkeys tested. \"It gave me hope that this actually might work,\" he said. </p><p>   After Dr. Stoffels at J&amp;J saw the monkey data, he said he, too, concluded, \"Yes, we can do this.\" </p><p>   The results helped shape J&amp;J's decision to start a series of human tests -- and to see if a single dose provided enough protection for widespread use during a pandemic emergency. </p><p>   In July, J&amp;J began testing its single-dose Covid-19 vaccine on more than 1,000 healthy adult volunteers. The company also ran parallel tests to see whether giving two doses about two months apart would be more effective. </p><p>   The single-dose shot kept proving itself. In an early study, it produced antibodies to neutralize the coronavirus in people at levels that were stable for at least 71 days after vaccination. </p><p>   That prompted J&amp;J to run a large clinical trial. The study began in September and enrolled about 44,000 people in the U.S. and other countries. The results formed the basis for the FDA's authorization, which, Dr. Stoffels said, capped \"the work of 10 years of research.\" </p><p></p>",
