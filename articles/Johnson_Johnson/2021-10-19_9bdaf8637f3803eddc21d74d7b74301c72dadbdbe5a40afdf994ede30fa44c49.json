  "title": "Higher Sales Across Divisions Lift Johnson & Johnson as Healthcare Sector Recovers; Company's revenue rose 11% year over year in third quarter to $23.34 billion",
  "text": "<p>Medical-device sales grew 7.6% amid a higher level of surgical procedures. Pharmaceutical sales were up 14%, the result of more prescriptions of drugs for multiple myeloma, inflammatory diseases and other conditions. Johnson &amp; Johnson's sales of consumer products such as Tylenol, Motrin and skin-care lines rose 5.7%. Those sales trends exclude acquisitions and divestitures.</p><p>Earnings were $1.37 a share—up from $1.33 a year ago—or $2.60 a share after stripping out one-time items. Wall Street analysts had been forecasting sales of $23.64 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.35 a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>The quarterly report is to be the last released during the tenure of Chief Executive Alex Gorsky, who took up the position nine years ago. Joaquin Duato, a longtime executive at the company, is set to take over as CEO in January.</p><p>Last week, an advisory panel recommended that the Food and Drug Administration approve an additional dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine to boost the protection it delivers. The FDA must now decide whether to clear a second shot. The panel recommended people get a second dose at least two months after their first shot.</p><p>Of the roughly 189.3 million Americans considered fully vaccinated, about 8% received Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Almost all others were vaccinated with two-dose regimens from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE or from Moderna Inc.</p><p>Also last week, Johnson &amp; Johnson took a step pressing for settlement of tens of thousands of lawsuits alleging links between its talc-based products and cancer. It placed into bankruptcy a corporate entity that holds its liabilities for the lawsuits, following a tactic used to protect assets and boosting a settlement's appeal for plaintiffs.</p><p>The company, which didn't declare bankruptcy itself, has maintained that its baby powder was safe and didn't contain asbestos. Johnson &amp; Johnson stopped selling talc-based baby powder in the U.S. and Canada last year.</p><p>After the latest quarter's earnings growth, Johnson &amp; Johnson raised its forecast for full-year profits. It now expects adjusted earnings of $9.77 a share to $9.82 a share in 2021, compared with its July outlook of $9.60 a share to $9.70 a share.</p><p>Its stock rose 1.4% in premarket trading after closing on Monday at $160.12.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Higher Sales Across Divisions Lift Johnson &amp; Johnson as Healthcare Sector Recovers</p>",
