  "text": "<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson said that it still expected to meet its vaccine production targets despite quality control problems at one of its supplier's plants that ruined a batch of its single-shot Covid-19 jabs. </p> <p>Workers at a Baltimore-based plant run by Emergent BioSolutions, which manufactures Covid-19 vaccine ingredients for J&amp;J and AstraZeneca, accidentally mixed up substances for the two shots, The New York Times reported, citing federal officials. </p> <p>The mistake was reported to have affected about 15m doses of J&amp;J's vaccine. </p> <p>J&amp;J said that it had “identified one batch of drug substance that did not meet quality standards” at the Emergent plant. The factory has yet to secure emergency authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration to manufacture substances for the vaccine. </p> <p>The batch was not sent on to the final stages of the vaccine manufacturing process, the company added. </p> <p>However, the company said it still expected to deliver 100m doses for use in the US during the first half of the year, and that it aimed to hit that target <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89442c1b-8295-4682-9f09-c040b9017882\">by the end of May</a>.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/53e8300d-2525-4271-80d2-e12fe008d2cd.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>J&amp;J said it was on track to deliver its vaccine at a rate of more than 1bn doses by the end of 2021.</p> <p>Emergent BioSolutions did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>The problems with J&amp;J's manufacturing process came less than a week after President Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1accbdf-0010-426c-9442-feb73b5c8a1d\">doubled his target</a> for the number of shots to be administered during his first 100 days in office, to 200m.</p> <p>As of Wednesday, more than 150m shots had been administered in the US — including 3.3m J&amp;J jabs — according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with 21.1 per cent of the population over the age of 18 being fully vaccinated.</p> <p>J&amp;J's vaccine, which is also being produced at its facility in the Netherlands, last month <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4640fa4f-34b4-4198-87d2-50040e5c728e\">received authorisatio</a>n from the FDA for emergency use. </p> <p>In an effort to meet its global supply targets, the company engaged two contract manufacturers in the US, tapping Emergent to make the drug substance and New Jersey-headquartered Catalent to help with the final stage of production, known as fill and finish.</p> <p>A Catalent plant was granted authorisation from the FDA in late March, but Emergent's factory <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5ba2702-3bad-4f10-9d80-00eb3d48d802\">has yet to secure</a> the same status. That has meant that while Emergent can ship doses to Catalent, those shots cannot be distributed until both suppliers have been cleared.</p><p>Source: Peter Wells in New York 2021 'J&amp;J sticks to vaccine targets after batch ruined in factory error' FT.com 1 April.
