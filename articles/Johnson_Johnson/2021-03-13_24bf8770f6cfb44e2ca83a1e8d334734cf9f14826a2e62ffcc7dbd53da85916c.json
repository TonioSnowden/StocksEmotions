  "title": "U.S. News:  U.S. Seeks India's  Assistance on China  ----  By William Mauldin and Sabrina Siddiqui in Washington and Rajesh Roy in New Delhi",
  "text": "<p>   The Biden administration is working to embed India in a network of nations in sharp competition with China, though they need to smooth over disagreements that include human rights and New Delhi's acquisition of a Russian defense system. </p><p>   Highlighting the push was Friday's virtual meeting between President Biden and the prime ministers of two longtime treaty allies -- Australia and Japan -- as well as of India, the fourth country in the so-called Quad and the least developed economically. </p><p>   The leaders committed to a full-throttle effort to expand production in India of Covid-19 vaccines designed by U.S. company Johnson &amp; Johnson, with some of the doses going to Southeast Asian and other developing nations, in an effort, an Indian official said, to compete with China's \"vaccine diplomacy\" with other developing countries. </p><p>   While the Quad has been around on and off for more than a decade, Washington in recent years has turned to the group as the U.S. rivalry with China intensified. India's has too. A clash last year between Indian and Chinese troops along their contested Himalayan border was the deadliest in more than five decades and provided an additional opening for Washington. </p><p>   A slate of challenges now looms if the Biden administration is to keep relations on track. India is in the midst of acquiring the advanced Russian S-400 missile system, a step that could result in U.S. sanctions. The Indian government's treatment of religious minorities and recent farmers' protests have brought renewed scrutiny from human-rights groups and members of Congress. </p><p>   India's government has threatened to jail employees of Facebook Inc., its WhatsApp unit and Twitter Inc. in response to the tech companies' reluctance to comply with data and takedown requests related to protests by Indian farmers, people familiar with the warnings said. India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology denies the government has issued such threats to social-media firms. </p><p>   These tensions with India, which has long championed its nonaligned status, contrast sharply with that of Australia and Japan, whose solid cooperation with the U.S. in defense is backed by shared views on governance and free markets. </p><p>   Biden administration officials are treading carefully as they try to assemble a coordinated international strategy against China. They say India, as a democracy with a rapidly growing economy, offers opportunities to work on a range of issues. </p><p></p>",
