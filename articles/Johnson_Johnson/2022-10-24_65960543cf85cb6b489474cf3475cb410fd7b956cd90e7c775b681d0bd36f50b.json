No other Unilever products are affected by the recall.</p><p>Daily exposure to benzene in the recalled products at the levels detected in testing wouldn't be expected to cause adverse health consequences, Unilever said, citing an independent health-hazard evaluation.</p><p>\"Unilever U.S. is recalling these products out of an abundance of caution,\" the company said in a statement dated last week. \"Unilever has received no reports of adverse events to date relating to this recall.\"</p><p>The company didn't respond to a request for comment on Monday.</p><p>An internal investigation by Unilever identified the products' propellant as the source. Unilever said it is working with its propellant suppliers to address this issue.</p><p>Benzene can cause harmful effects on bone marrow and can cause a decrease in red blood cells, leading to anemia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can also cause excessive bleeding and can weaken the immune system, according to the CDC.</p><p>Federal health officials also said long-term exposure to high levels of benzene can cause leukemia.</p><p>Consumers can get information about reimbursements for these recalled products by visiting UnileverRecall.com.</p><p>Other aerosol products have been recalled in the past due to the possible presence of benzene.
