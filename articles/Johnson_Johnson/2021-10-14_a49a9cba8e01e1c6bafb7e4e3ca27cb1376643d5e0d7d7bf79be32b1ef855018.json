  "text": "<p>A bankruptcy judge threw out 15,700 votes in favor of the cancer-victim compensation plan of Imerys Talc, once a supplier of Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p>Judge tosses decisive votes on J&amp;J talc supplier's bankruptcy plan. A bankruptcy judge threw into doubt the chapter 11 plan put forth by former Johnson &amp; Johnson supplier Imerys Talc America Inc., tossing out more than 15,700 votes cast in its favor. The court ruling upends a critical vote on the chapter 11 plan put forth by Imerys, which filed for bankruptcy over the growing number of legal claims alleging that talc causes cancer.</p><p>The judge overseeing the Imerys bankruptcy sided with J&amp;J, which sought to disqualify key votes from a personal injury lawyer. The dispute over plan voting was closely watched among bankruptcy professionals as more companies turn to chapter 11 to resolve mass-tort litigation over defective products or other injury claims.</p><p>Imerys has already sold off its assets, but needs court approval for how it will resolve its share of liability for current and future talc claims. After Wednesday's ruling, the company's chapter 11 administrators now lack enough support from injury claimants to move forward with its proposed plan.</p><p>\"In order for master ballots to work, great trust is placed in the plaintiffs' bar. With respect to Bevan &amp; Associates, the evidence shows that such trust was not well-placed.\"</p><p>— Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.</p><p>Share this email with a friend.</p><p>Bankruptcy</p><p>Purdue Pharma opposes Justice Department bid for immediate appellate review. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP is opposing a bid by the Justice Department's bankruptcy unit and a handful of state attorneys general for immediate appellate court review of its $4.5 billion settlement with members of the Sackler family who own the company.</p><p>Purdue said in a filing Wednesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White Plains, N.Y. that government authorities seek to \"short-circuit\" the normal bankruptcy appeals process, which normally starts with a review by a federal district judge.</p><p>The Justice Department and states seeking to overturn the settlement and Purdue's broader restructuring plan have said they want an immediate review of the deal by the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p><p>Purdue said Tuesday the Second Circuit has never immediately reviewed an order confirming a bankruptcy plan. Last month, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain approved the settlement which will shield members of the Sackler family from civil opioid lawsuits. — Jonathan Randles</p><p>Bipartisan bill targets executive bonuses paid before bankruptcy. Federal lawmakers introduced bipartisan legislation yesterday that would make it easier for the Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog to recover executive bonuses paid before a company files chapter 11.</p><p>A bill sponsored by Rep. Cheri Bustos (D., Ill.) and Rep. Tim Burchett (R., Tenn.) would allow the U.S. Trustee to claw back bonuses paid six months before a chapter 11 filing if the awards wouldn't have been permitted during a bankruptcy or were paid to employees making more than $250,000 a year.</p><p>The lawmakers introduced a version of the proposed legislation in 2019 but the bill introduced this week includes recommendations from a September Government Accountability Office report recommending ways to curb such bonuses. The GAO report said troubled companies paid $165 million in executive retention bonuses before filing bankruptcy in the 2020 fiscal year. — Jonathan Randles</p><p>Teligent CEO, legal chief resign ahead of bankruptcy filing. Teligent Inc. said Thursday that Chief Executive Tim Sawyer and legal chief Philip Yachmetz resigned from the company, effective Oct. 8, ahead of the company's bankruptcy filing. The Buena, N.J., pharmaceutical company didn't specify the reason for the departures.</p><p>In connection with the chapter 11 filing, the company said it has named Vladimir Kasparov, managing director at interim management firm Portage Point Partners LLC, as its restructuring chief. It also added Bradley Scher, the founder and managing member of Ocean Ridge Capital Advisors LLC, to its board to enhance the slate's restructuring expertise. Teligent's finance chief, Ernest De Paolantonio, resigned last month for reasons unrelated to any disagreement with the company. It tapped Alyssa Lozynski, a director at Portage Point Partners, as its interim finance chief. — Dave Sebastian</p><p>Economy</p><p>Fed worried about inflation risk as it firmed up tapering plan. Federal Reserve officials last month worried that disrupted supply chains were raising the risks of more persistent inflation as they firmed up plans to reduce their bond-buying stimulus program next month and conclude it by the middle of next year.</p><p>$120 Billion</p><p>The Fed's monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage securities</p><p>White Collar</p><p>Elizabeth Holmes trial: Retailers vetted Theranos without testing devices. In 2010, Theranos Inc. was courting two major retailers, hoping to put its laboratory technology in busy pharmacies across the country. The blood-testing startup won over Safeway Inc. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. with the promise of real-time and cheaper lab testing, which would expand affordable healthcare for consumers and bring in more revenue to the retail giants, according to court testimony in the criminal trial of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.</p><p>Distress</p><p>Apollo to take over Riverbed in restructuring. Apollo Global Management Inc. is leading a group of investors that are recapitalizing network optimization company Riverbed Technology Inc.'s debt that would reduce it by more than $1 billion.</p><p>The proposed deal is also expected to provide Riverbed with a $100 million infusion of cash and result in the Apollo-led group becoming the majority owners of Riverbed, according to a news release. San Francisco-based Riverbed said the process of implementing the restructuring could involve a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.</p><p>Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's ratings in December with a negative outlook, citing a restructuring of its \"very large debt burden\" proposed by owners, which it said included Thoma Bravo. — Ted Bunker</p><p>Consumers</p><p>Federal eviction ban ends, but mass evictions aren't happening. A modest uptick in evictions reflects how renter protections at the city and state levels still remain in parts of the country, according to housing attorneys and advocates, while landlords argue the risk of an eviction epidemic was always overstated and that most building owners have been willing to work with cash-strapped tenants.</p>",
