  "text": "<p>In the wake of the problem, J&amp;J is taking over production of the vaccine ingredient at the Emergent plant.</p><p>The plant will no longer make the main ingredient for AstraZeneca PLC's Covid-19 vaccine so it can focus exclusively on J&amp;J's shot.</p><p>Emergent, which last year received a $628 million federal contract to manufacture Covid-19 vaccines and drugs, said late Sunday the additional $23 million is from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a part of the Department of Health and Human Services. It will be used for biologics manufacturing equipment specific to J&amp;J's vaccine. Emergent said J&amp;J will now have final sign-off for manufacturing the main ingredient at Emergent's plant.</p>",
