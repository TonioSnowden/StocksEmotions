  "text": "<p>US Chapter 11 bankruptcy is typically used by companies that are overwhelmed by their debts. Corporate restructurings managed by courts are also the right forum for people who believe they are victims of corporate misdeeds, in the apparent view of one judge. </p> <p>Last week, a federal bankruptcy judge <a href=\"https://spark.ft.com/editor/2684c166-d0b7-4329-8714-84d506b99f15?edit=true\">refused to halt</a> the Chapter 11 filing of a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson, a consumer products giant. It bears billions of dollars of potential liability for talc powder alleged to cause illness. </p> <p>The case has caused a commotion because J&amp;J has not filed for bankruptcy itself. Instead, it has created a company that has filed for bankruptcy and would face off against the lawyers for thousands of alleged victims. The process is known as a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4bff8f60-8fdd-4e52-aaaf-5ada92d4311d\">Texas two-step</a>”.</p> <p>Critics allege that the move by J&amp;J is a farce for a company with a $400bn-plus market cap. Judge Michael Kaplan remarkably stated: “There is nothing to fear in the migration of tort (civil wrong) litigation out of the tort system and into the bankruptcy system.” </p> <p>Plaintiffs may cry foul. But more companies, like J&amp;J facing thousands of lawsuits over faulty products across America, are likely to follow suit into bankruptcy court.</p> <p>The attraction of the bankruptcy system to potential “mass tort” debtors is that pending lawsuits are halted while a judge oversees a single, streamlined negotiation process to pay victims out. The typical ways that product liability victims seek redress — class actions and multi-district lawsuits — do not always work out well. </p> <p>Victims, however, wonder if the bankruptcy process strong-arms them into substandard settlements. </p> <p>The J&amp;J vehicle that has filed for bankruptcy has as much as $60bn in value that could be tapped for a deal with talc victims. </p> <p>Critics of the Texas two-step should consider this: whether a tort resolution system is just or unjust does not depend solely on how much is paid out. It also hangs on the speed with which compensation is dispensed and how much is left after lawyers have been paid. </p><p>Source:  2022 'US bankruptcy/J&amp;J: new turn for Texas two-step' FT.com 1 March.
