  "title": "Stocks Rally on Strong Earnings",
  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 286.01 points, or 0.8%, to 34798.00, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 133.08 points, or 0.9%, to 14631.95.</p><p>A strong start to earnings season has helped buoy sentiment after Monday's steep selloff sparked by concerns over rising coronavirus cases. The market recently has been lurching from one fear to the next, said Yung-Yu Ma, chief investment strategist at BMO Wealth Management, and earnings have given investors something positive on which to focus.</p><p>\"It's nice to see some stabilization,\" he said.</p><p>The renewed risk appetite boosted small-cap stocks, too, which had fallen further than their large-cap brethren lately. The Russell 2000 surged 39.75 points, or 1.8%, to 2234.04, though it remains down 3.3% in July.</p><p>Many money managers say they see few other places than stocks to deploy cash, with yields on government and corporate bonds trading at depressed levels. Some remain concerned that the Delta variant will take some steam out of the global economic rebound, and they expect a jittery stretch of trading heading into the peak summer vacation period.</p><p>The bond market went a little \"nutso\" after the Federal Reserve started talking about interest rate increases, said Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management, driving long-term government bond yields higher. While things have settled down since the 10-year yield approached 1.75% in March, she said this environment should have investors on guard.</p><p>There are some \"stagflation\"-like impulses in the economy right now, she said, between still-high unemployment, labor shortages, supply shortages and rising inflation. If that takes hold, it could cause problems for investors in stocks and bonds and especially the traditional 60/40 portfolio model.</p><p>\"It's a prudent time for investors to be thinking about what if stagflation happens,\" she said.</p><p>The yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.279% from 1.208% Tuesday, its largest one-day jump since June 16. Yields move in the opposite direction to bond prices and have skidded in recent weeks in a sign of waning concerns about a prolonged overshoot in inflation.</p><p>Yields on government bonds are likely to rise back to those March highs, said Jonas Goltermann, senior markets economist at Capital Economics, but it will probably prompt investors to shift money back into stocks that benefit from the reopening of the economy.</p><p>\"The outlook in an absolute sense is still pretty good,\" he said. \"This is a rebound from a big recession.\"</p><p>U.S. crude oil rose 4.6% to $70.30, its biggest one-day percentage gain since April 14.</p><p>In corporate news, Chipotle Mexican Grill climbed $181.64, or 12%, to $1,755.99, a record, after reporting sales that blew past pre-pandemic levels. Coca-Cola added 72 cents, or 1.3%, to $56.55 after saying earnings this year would trump the beverage company's previous forecast.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson's revenue rose 27%, and shares of the medical company added $1.04, or 0.6%, to $169.49. Harley-Davidson fell $3.15, or 7.2%, to $40.65 on lower-than-expected motorcycle and related product sales.</p><p>\"Consumers are going to remain at least moderately cautious because of the spread of Delta everywhere,\" said Christopher Jeffery, head of inflation and rates strategy at Legal &amp; General Investment Management. \"It is really hard to think the U.K. template isn't at least going to be partly followed in the U.S. and Europe,\" he added, referring to a spike in cases in the U.K.</p><p>In overseas markets, the Stoxx Europe 600 jumped 1.6%, buoyed by shares of travel, leisure and retail companies. Japanese markets were closed for holidays Thursday and Friday. U.S. stock futures were flat.</p>",
