It follows unanimous recommendations from a panel of experts advising the CDC.</p><p>\"These recommendations are another example of our fundamental commitment to protect as many people as possible from Covid-19,\" Dr. Walensky said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How would you grade the vaccination campaign in your region? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The CDC didn't recommend any of the boosters over the others. Some advisory panel members, however, said they would prefer if people who received a J&amp;J vaccine get a booster from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE or from Moderna.</p><p>The moves follow the Food and Drug Administration's authorization Wednesday of Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson booster shots. The FDA also said people can get an extra dose that is different from the vaccine they received for their primary series.</p><p>Write to Felicia Schwartz at felicia.schwartz@wsj.com</p><p>Moderna and J&amp;J Covid-19 Boosters, Mixing and Matching Recommended by CDC</p>",
