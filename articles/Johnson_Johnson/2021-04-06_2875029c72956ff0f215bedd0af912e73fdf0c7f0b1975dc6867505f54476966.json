  "text": "<p>    Emergent BioSolutions Inc. said the federal government will pay the contract drug manufacturer an additional $23 million to purchase new manufacturing equipment to boost production of the main ingredient for Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine. </p><p>   Emergent operates a plant in Baltimore where a production problem recently ruined a batch of the main ingredient of J&amp;J's vaccine. The problem didn't affect finished doses that have already been distributed, and the plant isn't yet authorized by regulators to provide the ingredient for distributed doses. </p><p>   In the wake of the problem, J&amp;J is taking over production of the vaccine ingredient at the Emergent plant. </p><p>   The plant will no longer make the main ingredient for AstraZeneca PLC's Covid-19 vaccine so it can focus exclusively on J&amp;J's shot. </p><p>   Emergent, which last year received a $628 million federal contract to manufacture Covid-19 vaccines and drugs, said late Sunday the additional $23 million is from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a part of the Department of Health and Human Services. It will be used for biologics manufacturing equipment specific to J&amp;J's vaccine. Emergent said J&amp;J will now have final sign-off for manufacturing the main ingredient at Emergent's plant. </p><p></p>",
