The New York settlement includes an additional $33 million in attorney fees and costs, and calls for the drugmaker to no longer sell opioids nationwide, something Johnson &amp; Johnson said it already stopped doing. </p><p>\n  The company said there continues to be progress on the nationwide deal and that it \"remains committed to providing certainty for involved parties and critical assistance for communities in need.\" </p><p>\n  -- Sara Randazzo </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  MICHIGAN </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Thousands Without </p><p>\n  Power After Storm </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Residents in the Detroit area were cleaning up Sunday after flooding in the area overloaded sewer systems, damaged homes and knocked out power for thousands. </p><p>\n  Bags of trash lined neighborhood streets in suburban Grosse Pointe Farms as garbage trucks made special rounds to help pick up debris, including damaged furniture and bedding. A day earlier, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's office declared a state of emergency for Detroit and surrounding Wayne County. </p><p>\n  DTE Energy said roughly 22,000 customers remained without power Sunday. Indiana Michigan Power said crews were also were restoring power for thousands in Michigan and northern Indiana. </p><p>\n  More than 6 inches of rain fell Friday in parts of the Detroit area, overloading sewer systems. Some streets were completely flooded, while low-lying sections of freeways had water deep enough to cover car tires and hoods. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  MINNESOTA </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Agreement Reached </p><p>\n  On Public-Safety Bill </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Minnesota's top Democratic and Republican lawmakers reached agreement on the highlights of a public-safety bill that includes police-accountability measures, a day after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison for the death of George Floyd. </p><p>\n  While some details had yet to be finalized, leaders from both parties said the compromise reached late Saturday settles the major issues after months of negotiations. It has been the most contentious piece of budget negotiations among a divided legislature that is up against a Wednesday deadline to avoid a government shutdown. </p><p>\n  The Democratic-controlled state House included several policing provisions in its overall public-safety budget bill this session in the hopes of building on a package the legislature approved last summer. </p><p>\n  The 223-page bill draft includes provisions regulating the use of no-knock warrants, a police misconduct database to create an early warning system to keep bad officers off the streets, and the creation of an office of missing and murdered indigenous relatives as well as a task force for missing and murdered Black women. </p><p>\n  Republicans who control the Senate resisted many of the Democrats' proposals, calling some \"anti-police.\" The GOP negotiations at times focused those pushing to abolish the police, as well as violent protests following Mr. Floyd's killing. The agreement includes $2 million for violent-crime enforcement teams, a Republican-backed provision. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p></p>",
