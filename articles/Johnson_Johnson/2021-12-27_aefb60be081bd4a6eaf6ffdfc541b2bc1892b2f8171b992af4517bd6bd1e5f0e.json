  "title": "What to Do if You Test Positive for Covid-19 as Omicron Variant Surges; Whom should you tell, how long should people quarantine, and when should you call your doctor? Here are answers to your questions.",
  "text": "<p>The highly contagious Omicron variant of Covid-19 is spreading widely in the U.S. and more people are testing positive for the virus, including those who have been vaccinated or boosted.</p><p>After nearly two years of pandemic, figuring out what you're supposed to do after receiving a positive test result is still tricky, and varying vaccination status among the population makes the questions more complex.</p><p>Here's what doctors and public health officials say you should do after a positive test—from quarantining, to informing contacts and seeking medical care.</p><p>What do I do if I test positive for Covid-19?</p><p>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines are the same whether you are unvaccinated, vaccinated or boosted: Isolate for five days. If you have no symptoms after five days, you may leave isolation, but should wear a mask around other people for five more days. If you have a fever, you should continue to stay home.</p><p>How do I isolate?</p><p>Remain at home in a private room and bathroom, if possible. Avoid or limit interaction with other members of your household. If you must be in the same room with others, everyone should wear a high-quality mask. Keep the room well ventilated, such as by opening windows or doors, doctors say.</p><p>If I get a negative test result during my isolation period, can I stop isolating?</p><p>No, doctors say. False positive PCR tests are rare. And a rapid test isn't as sensitive as a PCR test, so you can't necessarily interpret a negative rapid-test result as a sign that you're no longer infectious.</p><p>\"A rapid test will become negative well before a PCR will become negative, so could you still be shedding? We don't know,\" says David Wohl, a professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p><p>Do I just stop isolating after five days, or do I need a negative test result?</p><p>Generally, you don't need a negative test result to come out of isolation, doctors say. You should be sure that your symptoms are resolving and that 24 hours have passed since any fever or use of fever-reducing medications. Some employers or institutions might require a test, so it is worthwhile to check those guidelines if you aren't certain.</p><p>If you are severely ill, talk to your doctor about isolating longer. People who are immunocompromised due to a health condition or medication may need to isolate for longer.</p><p>\"We know that typically our immunocompromised patients' immune systems don't clear this virus as quickly as others,\" says Kristin Englund, an infectious-disease physician at Cleveland Clinic. \"They may shed the virus for longer.\"</p><p>Whom do I need to inform after a positive test?</p><p>At the very least, you should tell your \"close contacts,\" which the CDC defines as anyone you've been within 6 feet of for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period.</p><p>Some doctors recommend casting a broader net. If you've been symptomatic for a few days and then test positive, tell people you've been in contact with since you started experiencing symptoms, Dr. Englund says. \"There's a good chance the sniffles from a couple of days ago was Covid,\" she says.</p><p>Dr. Wohl believes the 6-foot and 15-minute guidance is outdated, since the Delta and Omicron variants are more contagious than the original version of the virus. \"I would be concerned if it was 6.5 minutes of contact,\" he says. \"I would let anyone that you were around indoors without a mask—especially if you were within 6 feet—know.\"</p><p>Do close contacts who are vaccinated or boosted have to quarantine?</p><p>Vaccinated and boosted people exposed to someone with Covid-19 should wear a mask around others for 10 days and take a Covid-19 test five days after exposure if possible, the CDC says.</p><p>People who are unvaccinated should stay home for five days and wear a mask around others for an additional five days, the CDC says, with a test recommended on Day 5. If symptoms develop, they should stay home and test. The same guidance applies to people who haven't gotten a booster but received their two shots of Pfizer or Moderna more than six months ago, or got a Johnson &amp; Johnson shot more than two months ago.</p><p>What if my close contact is someone I live with, like my spouse or child? Should I take more precautions?</p><p>Ideally, the person who tested positive is isolating from other household members as much as possible. If and when they can't, everyone should take precautions including wearing masks while in the same room, and keeping doors and windows open to improve ventilation, even if everyone in the home is vaccinated.</p><p>When should I call my doctor?</p><p>Call your doctor if your symptoms include a high fever for multiple days, difficulty breathing or chest pain, or an inability to drink or eat, experts say. A loss of smell and taste is a common symptom, and may persist beyond 10 days.</p><p>Your doctor can also advise whether you're eligible for an outpatient monoclonal antibody treatment, says Graham Snyder, medical director of infection prevention and hospital epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.</p><p>The infusion treatments, which can reduce the severity and length of illness, are geared to people with mild to moderate illness. Recent data has shown that some treatments aren't very effective against the Omicron variant. But most PCR lab test results don't specify what version of the virus you test positive for.</p><p>What should I have at home when I'm isolating?</p><p>Doctors recommend having a thermometer and pulse oximeter, which measures your oxygen level, as well as over-the-counter ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Drink plenty of fluids.</p><p>Which symptoms merit a hospital or emergency room visit?</p><p>Go if you experience severe shortness of breath or chest pain. Check your oxygen levels a few times a day with a pulse oximeter even if you don't feel short of breath. A normal oxygen saturation level is between 95% and 100%, the CDC says.</p><p>How soon after an isolation period should I get a vaccine dose or booster?</p><p>Doctors advise waiting to get a vaccine or booster until you feel fully recovered. But do get those shots if you haven't, doctors say.</p><p>Evidence from South Africa indicates that antibodies from prior Covid infection aren't as protective as they were against earlier strains. \"Every indication is that the booster is going to be important in having protection against Omicron,\" says Dr. Snyder.</p><p>Julie Wernau and Nidhi Subbaraman contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Sumathi Reddy at sumathi.reddy@wsj.com</p><p>What to Do if You Test Positive for Covid-19 as Omicron Variant Surges</p>",
