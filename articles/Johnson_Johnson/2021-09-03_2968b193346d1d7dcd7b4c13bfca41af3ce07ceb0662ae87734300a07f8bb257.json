  "title": "World News: EU Will Return J&J's Vaccines to Africa",
  "text": "<p>Aspen has a contract with J&amp;J to fill vials and package the U.S. company's vaccine, with some 40% of its production slated for export to Europe through September and the rest going to African countries. \"That arrangement has been suspended,\" Mr. Masiyiwa said Thursday. \"All the vaccines from this facility are now under the control of the South African government.\"</p><p>The total number of vaccines that will be returned hasn't been determined, but the EU in total received fewer than 20 million doses, of which all the ones that are sitting in warehouses would be sent back, Mr. Masiyiwa said.</p><p>A spokesman for the European Commission declined to comment. A J&amp;J spokesman said the company doesn't direct the allocation of its doses within countries and wasn't involved in talks \"that have occurred in some cases between countries relating to the reallocation or donation of the vaccine.\"</p><p>The African Union has made a deal to buy up to 400 million doses of J&amp;J's single-dose inoculation, enough to vaccinate about 30% of its citizens. However, only about 50 million of those doses were due to be delivered this year, a figure that Mr. Masiyiwa said should increase to around 70 million because of the EU agreement.</p><p>African countries have struggled to secure shots, as rich economies such as the EU and the U.S. bought up much of the 2021 production. Most were counting on free vaccines they had been promised by the World Health Organization 's Covax program, which has fallen far short of its targets.</p><p>As a result, less than 3% of Africa's 1.3 billion people have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, while around 58% of Europeans have been fully immunized, according to Our World in Data, a project based at the University of Oxford . The WHO warned Thursday that 42 of Africa's 54 countries likely would miss a target of vaccinating at least 10% of their citizens by the end of September. The continent is suffering through a record wave of infections driven by the more transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus.</p><p>African officials say a key reason why the continent has been left behind in the global vaccination race is because it doesn't produce enough shots at home. Aspen is the only plant on the continent making one of the leading Western vaccines, and is dependent on importing the drug substance used in doses from Europe or the U.S.</p><p>In its annual results presentation on Wednesday, Aspen said it was in talks with J&amp;J to secure a license to manufacture, market and sell its vaccine in Africa. The J&amp;J spokesman said the companies are \"in discussions to evaluate the further expansion of capacity at Aspen's vaccine manufacturing facility . . . including a possible license for Africa.\"</p>",
