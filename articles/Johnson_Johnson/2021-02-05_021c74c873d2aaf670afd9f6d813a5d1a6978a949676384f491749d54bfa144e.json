  "text": "<p>The former owner of Gatwick airport has switched sides and joined the Bill Gates-backed consortium seeking to buy private jet services company <strong>Signature Aviation</strong>. </p> <p>Global Infrastructure Partners, which still manages a near-50 per cent stake in Gatwick on behalf of investors, said it had launched a £3.5bn bid for Signature in partnership with private equity group Blackstone&#xa0;and Gate's Cascade Investment. The newly formed consortium offered 411p per share.</p> <p>GIP had last month <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e35c9245-dd4d-4fea-a640-3b69faf76705\">agreed to buy</a> Signature for £3.4bn with an offer of 405p a share, having waged a back-and-forth auction with Blackstone, Cascade and Carlyle&#xa0;since mid-December.</p> <p>Cascade and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation will retain their 19 per cent share of the company as part of the deal. Their consortium's offer is a 53 per cent premium to Signature's closing price of 268p on December 16, when it entered an offer period.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p>Package holiday company <strong>On the Beach</strong> said demand has remained “very weak” with UK traffic and bookings for the four months to January down 73 per cent and 83 per cent respectively. The company, which has stopped selling holidays that depart before the start of May, said monthly cash burn remains at £2m versus £39m of cash at the end of January and&#xa0;£75m undrawn on its revolving credit facility.</p> <p><strong>French Connection</strong> is back in takeover talks. The retailer, which last year abandoned plans to sell itself after a year-long review, said it had received two separate approaches: from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-20/strand-equity-s-rodsky-eyes-brands-with-500-million-venture\">Seth Rodsky</a>'s investment vehicle Spotlight Brands in partnership with Gordon Brothers, the restructuring adviser that last year bought the Laura Ashley brand; and from Go Global Retail, a California brand investor, which the company said was working with HMJ International Services. Talks remain at a very early stage, French Connection added.</p> <p>Insurer <strong>Beazley</strong> reported a narrower than feared 2020 loss and a fatter than expected surplus capital position. Its loss before tax for the 12 months ending December was $50.4m, versus $267m in 2019 but well ahead of the $106.4m loss expected by the consensus. Excess capital was 23 per cent of the regulatory bound, known as the enhanced capital requirement, near the top of its target range. </p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p>Shares in <strong>Kuaishou</strong>&#xa0;nearly tripled on their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05686da9-60f8-4a3a-a5c5-95155bd01ffe\">first day of trading</a> in Hong Kong, propelling the valuation of the Chinese streaming video platform to within touching distance of ByteDance, the owner of its chief rival TikTok. The company raised about $5.4bn in its initial public offering, the biggest in the tech industry since Uber raised over $8bn in 2019.</p> <p><strong>Gilead</strong> generated almost $2bn in revenue from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2242caf-bbf6-442a-a715-3bbd68175c98\">its Covid-19 drug</a> in the fourth quarter, as half of all hospitalised patients in the US are given remdesivir. <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong> has filed an application seeking emergency use authorisation for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c5fe0f7-fe48-4cf9-831b-1b74325763fd\">its Covid-19 vaccine</a> with the Food and Drug Administration, bringing the company one step closer to getting the first single-shot vaccine distributed in the US.</p> <p>The worldwide shortage of semiconductors is forcing <strong>Ford</strong> to cut production next week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0d5ca20-2559-4d47-9106-cf50eaf97720\">at two plants</a> that make its bestselling F-150 pick-up truck. The shortage could cut Ford's earnings this year by as much as $2.5bn, said John Lawler, chief financial officer. <strong>German carmakers</strong>, meanwhile, are considering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ecd3ccd-18d1-45a0-afb6-84719bdadf52\">building up semiconductor stockpiles</a> to avoid shortages.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Lombard</strong> Compass gave us one of the most memorable images of the pandemic: a lunchtime support parcel from its Chartwells school catering subsidiary. The fiasco <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/507ce6a0-ce83-4106-8adf-9b41b22c5f73\">was a reminder</a> of what can happen if standards slip.</p> <p><strong>Merryn Somerset Webb </strong>While you need never think of GameStop again, now the r/WallStreetBets Reddit chatroom has dropped out of the headlines, you should definitely keep thinking about silver. Why? Because it is likely to play <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/faef0bde-f95a-4f9b-a3f1-4cdea304b12a\">a core role</a> in the&#xa0;next commodity super cycle.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
