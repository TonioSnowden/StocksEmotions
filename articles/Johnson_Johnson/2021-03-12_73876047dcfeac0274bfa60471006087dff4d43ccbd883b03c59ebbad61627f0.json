  "title": "World News: EU Approves J&J's Single-Shot Vaccine --- Questions remain about how fast shots will be delivered on a big scale amid delays",
  "text": "<p>The EMA's decision to recommend authorization of the J&amp;J vaccine followsU.S. approvalin late February.</p><p>The J&amp;J vaccine has the potential to significantly bolster vaccination drives over time. It can be kept in refrigerators instead of freezers, making it easier to store and distribute than some vaccines already approved, and recipients need only one dose rather than the two administered for other vaccines, often many weeks apart.</p><p>Trials found J&amp;J's vaccine had a high impact in preventing serious illness but was 67% effective overall when moderate cases were included. Side effects were usually mild or moderate, the EMA said.</p><p>J&amp;J said the data also showed 85% efficacy in preventing cases of serious disease.</p><p>\"We remain confident that the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine will prove a critical tool for fighting this pandemic,\" said Paul Stoffels, the company's chief scientific officer.</p><p>Despite the approval, questions persist about how quickly J&amp;J will start delivering vaccines on a large scale, following manufacturing problems in the U.S. This week, EU officials said they were hopeful the company would meet its second-quarter EU distribution target of 55 million doses and that they would get a fuller picture after the EMA's approval decision.</p><p>The EU vaccination campaign has been hampered by late signing of contracts, delivery problems and difficulties distributing the vaccines in some member states. For now, the vaccination rate in the EU is well below those in the U.S. and U.K.</p><p>In France, Germany and Italy, less than 8% of people have received their first dose, according to Wednesday's daily data from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.</p><p>With Covid-19 deaths high even in countries like Germany, which performed well during the first wave of coronavirus, much of Europe has been in lockdown for months, hitting the region's troubled economy and drawing protests in some countries. On Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that her country faces three tough months ahead.</p><p>J&amp;J has agreed to provide the EU with 200 million doses this year, and the EU has the option of buying another 200 million. The company said last week it was confident it would meet its full-year target.</p><p>On Wednesday, President Biden said J&amp;J had agreed to provide the U.S. an additional 100 million doses in the second half of this year, on top of the 100 million it was already due to deliver. To overcome manufacturing difficulties, the White House helped negotiate an agreement between J&amp;J and longtime competitor Merck &amp; Co., in which Merck will help produce J&amp;J's vaccine.</p><p>The EU and the U.S. started talks this week on ensuring that they don't block vital vaccine ingredients from export to each other.</p>",
