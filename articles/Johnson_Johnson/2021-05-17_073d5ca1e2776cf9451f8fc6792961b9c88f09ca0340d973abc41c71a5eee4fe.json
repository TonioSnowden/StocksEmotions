  "text": "<p>Joe Biden said his administration will send at least 20m doses of US-authorised Covid vaccines to other countries in the coming weeks, vowing to provide an “arsenal of vaccines for the rest of the world”.</p> <p>In a speech at the White House on Monday, the US president said the government would share “at least” 20m doses of BioNTech/Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines with the rest of the world by the end of June, on top of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db461dd7-b132-4f08-a94e-b23a6764bdb3\">60m doses</a> of the AstraZeneca vaccine already committed to other countries. </p> <p>The Pfizer, Moderna and J&amp;J jabs have been authorised for use by the US Food and Drug Administration, while the AstraZeneca vaccine is still awaiting approval. Biden said doses of that jab would be exported once they received the regulator's green light.</p> <p>“Over the next six weeks, the United States of America will send 80m doses overseas,” Biden said. “This will be more vaccines than any country has actually shared to date, five times more than any other country. More than <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7625cd1-9c72-42c3-aaea-25ebde1a4c33\">Russia and China</a>, which have donated 15m doses.”</p> <p>He added: “We want to lead the world with our values, with this demonstration of our innovation and ingenuity and the fundamental decency of the American people.”</p> <p>Biden did not specify which countries would receive the doses but said he had tapped Jeff Zients, co-ordinator of the White House Covid-19 task force, to lead the effort. </p> <p>“We will share these vaccines in the service of ending the pandemic everywhere, and we will not use our vaccines to secure favours from other countries,” Biden said, adding the announcement was part of a wider US efforts to “respond” to the global pandemic.</p> <p>“We need to help fight the disease around the world to keep us safe here at home, and to do the right thing of helping other people,” the president said. </p> <p>Biden had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e00fe88e-263c-41da-9ac5-fdbbd71c928a\">previously said</a> that the US would share surplus vaccines only when there were enough jabs to meet American demand, despite calls from some world leaders and health officials to provide more assistance to countries struggling to secure enough jabs. </p> <p>“By the end of June, when we will have taken delivery of enough of such vaccines to protect everyone in the United States, the United States will share at least 20m of those doses, that extra supply, with other countries,” Biden said.</p> <p>Almost 40 per cent of the US population has now been vaccinated, although demand is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eed4eac2-e469-4f26-989e-23a26c97fd2c\">starting to ebb</a> in some parts of the country. </p> <p>Biden's announcement came one week after the FDA extended its emergency authorisation for vaccinations to cover <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/68721f4c-7635-43c3-aa9d-4caf7870ea18\">12- to 15-year-olds</a>. The president said the latest official figures showed that 60 per cent of Americans will have received at least one Covid-19 jab by Tuesday. </p> <p>“We still have tens of millions left to vaccinate. But we are making significant progress,” he said. “Every day, the light at the end of that tunnel is growing brighter.”</p> <p>The president also addressed the recent change in guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which said last week that fully vaccinated people could go <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef26b07c-0213-4653-89ea-a24ccd0d5a8d\">without face masks</a> for almost all indoor and outdoor settings.</p> <p>The abrupt change has led to confusion, particularly in cities and states where local laws still require face coverings or businesses have their own mask policies. </p> <p>Biden encouraged people to be “kind and respectful for one another as we come out of this pandemic, and respect those who want to continue to wear a mask, even if they have been vaccinated”.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/527bb88a-96bd-4112-8dd9-bb3747bde7fd.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Lauren Fedor in Washington 2021 'US to share at least 20m more Covid vaccines with other countries' FT.com 17 May.
