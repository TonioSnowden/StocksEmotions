  "title": "White House Plans Covid-19 Boosters Starting in the Fall",
  "text": "<p>In addition, President Biden signed a memorandum that directs the Education Department to use all available tools to ensure that students can return to the classroom safely, an effort intended in part to counter state efforts prohibiting mask requirements in schools.</p><p>Education Secretary Miguel Cardona plans to use his department's civil-rights enforcement authority to prevent states from blocking mask requirements in schools, according to department spokeswoman Rachel Thomas.</p><p>\"We need to make sure children are wearing masks in school,\" Mr. Biden said during a speech at the White House, adding that state politicians who oppose mask mandates are \"setting a dangerous tone.\"</p><p>Mr. Biden, a Democrat, also called on big U.S. companies to require their employees to get vaccinated. \"Employers have more power today to end the pandemic than they have ever had before,\" he said.</p><p>In another indication that the pandemic is far from over, the president said his administration will continue to reimburse states fully for some Covid-19 emergency response costs through Dec. 31, extending a policy that was set to expire Sept. 30.</p><p>States will also be eligible for retroactive reimbursement from the federal government for costs associated with the safe reopening of schools and healthcare and child-care facilities.</p><p>The recommendation for a booster shot reflects heightened concern over the highly contagious Delta variant and data showing initial immunity wanes over time.</p><p>\"It's the best way to protect ourselves from new variants that could arise,\" said Mr. Biden, referring to the booster shots.</p><p>The announcement means that booster shots will soon be available for the more than 155 million people in the U.S. who have been fully vaccinated with messenger-RNA vaccines from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE or from Moderna Inc.</p><p>The booster shot will be administered about eight months after the second dose for people ages 18 and older. The U.S. government said it is preparing to offer boosters starting the week of Sept. 20.</p><p>U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said the booster shots would help the country stay ahead of the virus, even though the current two-dose regimens are effective. He cited emerging evidence indicating that the vaccines lose some power over time and that the Delta variant warrants the extra boost.</p><p>\"Having reviewed the most current data, it is now our clinical judgment that the time to lay out a plan for Covid-19 boosters is now,\" Dr. Murthy said.</p><p>The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is authorized for people 12 years and older, while Moderna's is cleared for those 18 years and above. Regulators last week cleared booster shots for people with compromised immune systems.</p><p>Under the expanded plan, the U.S. would start offering the extra dose after the Food and Drug Administration authorizes it. The FDA is conducting an independent review, federal health officials said. People 65 and older and individuals in chronic-care facilities are expected to get boosters first, along with health workers and anyone else who was vaccinated earliest, according to federal health officials.</p><p>The third dose will be of the same vaccine from the two-dose regimen, according to people familiar with the plan. The extra dose will be offered free, similar to the way previous shots were handled, health officials said. They said that the U.S. had ample supplies to meet demand, with shots to be administered at the 80,000 pharmacies and other vaccination sites operating across the U.S.</p><p>The FDA has been weighing whether adults who received Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-dose vaccine will need another dose, according to the health officials. Data regarding J&amp;J's shot isn't complete, but it is likely this population will also need a booster, the officials said.</p><p>The expansion could later include people younger than 18 if the FDA authorizes boosters for that group. The agency is reviewing whether to clear the extra dose for 16- and 17-year-olds, a person familiar with the review said, but wants to assess the risk of heart-related side effects seen in rare instances in some young people who got the two-dose regimen.</p><p>Authorized vaccines appear to work well against new strains that have emerged, especially in protecting people against severe Covid-19, according to studies. Yet the shots don't appear to be quite as effective against the Delta variant as they were against the original strain, many studies indicate.</p><p>The administration's decision marks a reversal from early July, when federal regulators responded to a plan from Pfizer to seek authorization of an additional dose of its vaccine by saying that third shots weren't necessary and that vaccinated people were protected.</p><p>Studies indicate the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna both remain highly effective six months after a second dose. Yet there is some evidence that their efficacy might diminish over longer periods and that the shots aren't as effective against the Delta variant, prompting research into adding a third dose.</p><p>Behind the change in thinking on boosters was data through the end of July and early August from several studies in the U.S. and other countries on the vaccines' durability, federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said.</p><p>So far, the vaccines are holding up well in protecting against severe disease and hospitalization, she said, but the studies indicate that the shots lose power against infection and might lose effectiveness against severe disease.</p><p>---</p><p>Sabrina Siddiqui contributed to this article.</p><p>---</p><p>What to Know</p><p>About a Third Dose</p><p>The booster will be the same shot as the first two and will be available starting Sept. 20 for people who have previously received the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines.</p><p>For immunocompromised people, who already are authorized to get a third messenger RNA dose, the CDC says they should try to get the same type of vaccine as their first two shots, but can mix and match if they have to.</p><p>As with the previous shots, there will be no charge.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
