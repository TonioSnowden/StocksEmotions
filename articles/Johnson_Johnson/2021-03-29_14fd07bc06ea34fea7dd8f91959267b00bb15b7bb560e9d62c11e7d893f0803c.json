  "title": "U.S. News:  For Herd Immunity, Children Will Need the Shot, Too  ----  By Brianna Abbott and Jason Douglas",
  "text": "<p>   Countries are racing to immunize adults against Covid-19 and move toward a more normal future. To achieve the vaccination rates that health authorities are aiming for, the shots must eventually reach the arms of children and teenagers, too. </p><p>   Children aren't going to be vaccinated for several months at least, however, because drugmakers are still testing shots in younger ages. </p><p>   That means health authorities can't be confident of securing community protection against the virus, known as herd immunity, until later this year at the earliest, because children under 18 make up a significant proportion of many countries' populations. </p><p>   \"We definitely need to get kids vaccinated if we want to be as close to normal as we can,\" said Octavio Ramilo, chief of infectious diseases at Nationwide Children's Hospital, in Ohio. </p><p>   As governments push to move past the pandemic, vaccinating children is emerging as a key obstacle, along with initially limited supplies of vaccines. </p><p>   Researchers say between 70% and 85% of a population would need to be protected through infection or vaccination to achieve herd immunity, the point when so many people are immune that the virus has nowhere to go and even those who aren't immune have protection. </p><p>   \"It's hard to do that just in terms of numbers if you're not going to vaccinate kids,\" said Adam Ratner, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Hassenfeld Children's Hospital in New York. </p><p>   Children and adolescents make up 22% of the U.S. population, according to the Census Bureau's latest projections, and 18% of the population of the European Union. </p><p>   Drugmakers first tested Covid-19 vaccines in older ages. As a result, the shots have been authorized only for the oldest teenagers and adults so far. </p><p>   The shot from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE is cleared in the U.S. for people 16 and older, and vaccines from Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson for 18 years and up. A vaccine from AstraZeneca PLC and the University of Oxford is in use in the U.K. and EU for ages 18 and over. </p><p>   Pfizer has enrolled more than 2,000 kids from ages 12 to 15 in one study and expects to submit the data from that study to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in weeks. The FDA could authorize use by the fall, Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said at The Wall Street Journal's Health Forum on Tuesday. </p><p>   Pfizer said Thursday it had begun evaluating its vaccine in children 6 months to 11 years. </p><p>   Moderna is aiming to have its vaccine available for adolescents before the start of the 2021 school year and recently launched another trial with children as young as six months. Oxford is enrolling children ages 6 to 17 years in a trial of the vaccine it co-developed with AstraZeneca. </p><p>   Clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of vaccines in children that have already been cleared for adult use can be done more quickly than the large-scale studies in adults that have already taken place. </p><p>   Vaccines probably won't be ready for use in younger children until early 2022, health experts said. </p><p>   \"The dose is not such a big leap to go from adults to teens,\" said Katherine Luzuriaga, a pediatric infectious disease physician and the lead investigator of Moderna's adolescent trial at the University of Massachusetts Medical School site. \"Once we start going into the younger age groups, there's a bit more work to determine the appropriate doses.\" </p><p></p>",
