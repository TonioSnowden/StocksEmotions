  "title": "Ukraine's Zelensky Urges Global Businesses to Exit Russia in Speech to Congress; Companies have cited reasons from humanitarian to contractual arrangements for staying in Russia",
  "text": "<p>\"If you have companies in your districts who financed the Russian military machine…You should put pressure,\" he said. \"I am asking to make sure that the Russians do not receive a single penny that they use to destroy people in Ukraine.\"</p><p>Many Western companies have paused their operations in the Russian market, with some citing dismay at Moscow's aggression and others flagging the logistical challenges of operating in a country hit by sanctions. A handful of businesses have signaled intentions to leave altogether.</p><p>Other companies are staying. Some have cited humanitarian reasons, including providing essential goods like food or medicine. Others say their hands are tied by joint venture or franchise agreements. Then there are companies Russian prosecutors have warned of asset seizures if they withdraw from the country, as well as threats that employees could be arrested.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky's comments to U.S. lawmakers echo similar remarks he made to Canada's Parliament a day before, saying that more companies could be forced to leave Russia.</p><p>In a separate address Tuesday, Mr. Zelensky took aim at specific companies that he said hadn't left the Russian market.</p><p>He named Nestlé SA, Mondelez International Inc. and Unilever PLC, among \"other giants of the food industry,\" as well as financial firms Raiffeisen Bank International AG of Austria and French lender Société Générale SA.</p><p>The Ukrainian president also mentioned South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Co., pharmaceutical companies Sanofi SA and Johnson &amp; Johnson, along with chemicals giant BASF SE and Bayer AG, the agricultural and drugs supplier.</p><p>Food companies including Nestlé and Unilever said previously that they suspended advertising in Russia, along with imports and exports of all but essential food and other products. Both are also continuing local production of some products to sell in Russia.</p><p>Unilever and Mondelez didn't respond to requests for comment, while Nestlé declined to comment beyond previously issued statements.</p><p>Drug companies have broadly continued supplying medicines to Russia, saying that they feel an ethical obligation to do so, while publicly condemning the invasion.</p><p>Some, though, have scaled back certain activities. For instance, Sanofi and Bayer said Monday that they would halt all marketing in Russia and any spending not directly related to supplying their products into the country. Bayer also threatened to halt its crop supplies to Russia next year unless Moscow stops its attacks on Ukraine.</p><p>Spokespeople for Sanofi and Bayer declined to comment beyond their earlier statements. J&amp;J and BASF didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Financial firms have said they have a duty to support their clients. In response to Mr. Zelensky's remarks, a spokesman for SocGen said the bank was rigorously complying with all laws and regulations and \"conducting its business in Russia with the utmost caution and selectivity.\" Raiffeisen didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The bank has previously said it is prudent and selective in its business activities.</p><p>Samsung shareholders asked the TVs-to-cellphones maker during its annual meeting Wednesday whether it would consider pulling out of Russia. Co-CEO Han Jong-Hee said the company was looking carefully at the state of economic sanctions against Russia and reiterated that product shipments there had been suspended. Samsung didn't directly address Mr. Zelensky's remarks. Rival LG didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>A number of companies, including some Mr. Zelensky didn't call out, say they are grappling with specific arrangements in the Russian market that complicate any potential decision to pull back.</p><p>Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev SA operates in Russia through a joint venture with Anadolu Efes, in which it has a noncontrolling stake. AB InBev recently said it would ask the Turkish drinks maker to suspend its license to brew Budweiser in Russia.</p><p>Fast-food operator Burger King has more than 800 restaurants in Russia, but all are run by franchisees and managed locally. A spokeswoman said Burger King had suspended corporate support for the Russian market in areas such as marketing and operations and wasn't approving new investments.</p><p>Elsewhere, British retailer Marks &amp; Spencer PLC has a longstanding franchise agreement in Russia with Turkish conglomerate Fiba Group, leaving the British clothing retailer unable to close the 48 stores that bear its brand name there, according to a person familiar with the matter. M&amp;S stopped sending clothing shipments to Fiba in Russia earlier this month.</p><p>Jiyoung Sohn, Nick Kostov, Patricia Kowsmann and Heather Haddon contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com and Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com</p><p>Ukraine's Zelensky Urges Global Businesses to Exit Russia in Speech to Congress</p>",
