  "text": "<p>The agency says about half of booster-eligible people have gotten one so far, compared with about 69% of the eligible population who have completed a regular vaccine series.</p><p>Public-health officials and researchers say they don't want people to lose a sense of urgency and leave themselves unprepared for another potential ramp-up in cases or possible new variants in the future.</p><p>\"I don't think any of us are sure we are out of the Covid era,\" said Meg Fisher, special adviser to New Jersey's health commissioner and a pediatric infectious-disease specialist. She said all types of vaccinations have slumped in the Garden State, which launched a week-long booster push on Wednesday that includes vaccine sites staying open longer to accommodate people.</p><p>New Jersey, like New York, also has a mass text-messaging campaign targeting booster-eligible people. Colorado sent more than a million such messages last month. Maryland recently rolled out a new campaign that includes a possible $1 million prize.</p><p>Factors contributing to the booster slowdown likely include vaccinated people putting off additional shots after breakthrough infections, concerns that side effects like fevers and tiredness could cause them to miss work, and lack of urgency as case numbers plummet, according to Dr. Fisher.</p><p>\"As people become more complacent, they don't really see the need to get boosted,\" she said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What should be done to improve the vaccine booster campaign? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Data have shown that boosters can enhance protection against Covid-19 that would otherwise fade several months after initial vaccinations. While breakthrough infections were common during the Omicron wave, boosters helped limit infections and the severity of cases including hospitalizations, when compared with vaccinated people who weren't boosted and the unvaccinated, CDC data show. The federal agency has also found that boosted people have the lowest rates of Covid-19 deaths.</p><p>About 66% of the fully vaccinated population ages 65 and up are boosted, according to CDC data, compared with about 47% of the entire fully vaccinated adult population. Geographic patterns mirror those for other vaccine shots, from the highest rates of adoption in some New England states to some of the lowest rates among Southern states.</p><p>Authorities started recommending boosters for older and vulnerable people in September, and in November the government recommended them for all adults.</p><p>The CDC currently recommends boosters for anyone 12 years and older. People are advised to get boosters at least five months after they get their second dose of an mRNA vaccine from Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech, or at least two months after the single Johnson &amp; Johnson shot.</p><p>Omicron's decline has been rapid: The seven-day average for newly reported cases has fallen to below 75,000 from averages that topped 800,000 last month, data from Johns Hopkins University show. Hospitalization and death numbers are also heading lower.</p><p>CDC data, though subject to reporting lags and corrections in state submissions, appear to show demand is declining for both first vaccinations and boosters. The booster-eligible population is a prime target for getting more shots into arms because they have demonstrated a willingness to get the vaccine in the first place, researchers say.</p><p>\"Encouraging people who are already vaccinated to get boosted should in theory be much more straightforward,\" said Pratha Sah, an associate research scientist at Yale School of Public Health.</p><p>Confusing messaging could also be hindering the booster effort. The CDC deems two mRNA shots a full vaccination, for example, but also says boosters are needed for optimal protection. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said at a recent press conference that residents have told health officials they weren't sure they were eligible or needed boosters.</p><p>In central Florida, 62-year-old Sherry Swendsen got the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine last summer because her retail job required it. She now works from home as a travel consultant and has declined boosters. She said she doesn't have underlying health issues and isn't persuaded by evidence showing boosters can reduce the odds of severe illness.</p><p>\"Nobody can decide that, only God can,\" she said. \"Just because you don't get the shot doesn't mean you're going to die from it.\"</p><p>The sharp rise in breakthrough infections during the Omicron surge likely means there are people who got Covid-19 while waiting on the sidelines before getting boosted, said Buddy Creech, an infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.</p><p>Some physicians and researchers say the combination of infections and previous vaccine shots provide a high level of temporary immune-system protection. Waiting eight to 12 weeks after an infection to get the extra shot may provide a more effective boost, Dr. Creech said.</p><p>The CDC hasn't specified in its recommendations when vaccinated people who become infected should receive a booster, but says people should wait until they have fully recovered.</p><p>A mild Covid-19 case in January contributed to Jessica Turco Sandfort's decision not to get additional Covid-19 vaccine shots, after her one Moderna dose in April last year. Concerns about vaccine side effects, and seeing people she knew contract and have few or no symptoms from infections, had already given her pause.</p><p>\"Now I feel like I have more antibodies, so I'm not rushing,\" the 44-year-old community-college instructor said.</p><p>Jennifer Levitz and Jared S. Hopkins contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.com</p><p>Covid-19 Booster Shots Are Slowing as Omicron Surge Fades</p>",
