It's a protein-based vaccine, unlike the mRNA ones developed by Pfizer PFE and BioNTech BNTX and Moderna MRNA that have received authorization or J&amp;J's viral vector vaccine.</p><p>The meeting comes as U.S. cases are averaging 98,867 a day, down 8% from two weeks ago, according to a New York Times tracker.
