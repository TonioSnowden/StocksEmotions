  "title": "Profitable Companies Enlist Bankruptcy Courts to Sidestep Cancer Trials; Corporations facing unwieldy asbestos litigation are accessing the benefits of bankruptcy without filing chapter 11 themselves",
  "text": "<p>J&amp;J, Georgia-Pacific, Trane and Saint-Gobain haven't filed for bankruptcy. But they have used a Texas law to shift at least 250,000 personal-injury cases to bankruptcy court through newly created subsidiaries with limited business operations, a strategy developed by law firm Jones Day, court records show.</p><p>The Texas law let the companies fill their new subsidiaries with legal liability for pending and future injury litigation before those units filed for chapter 11. The bankruptcies have paused pending lawsuits either against the parent companies or their U.S. affiliates, locking injury claimants out of the tort system and preventing them, at least for now, from putting their claims to juries.</p><p>These four companies are receiving legal and financial benefits from chapter 11 without risking the likely loss of equity value that would come from placing whole business divisions in bankruptcy. The legal strategy will be put on trial in a New Jersey bankruptcy court later this month as personal-injury lawyers seek to dismiss the bankruptcy case filed in October by a J&amp;J subsidiary, LTL Management LLC, to drive a settlement of roughly 38,000 cancer lawsuits over its talc-based products.</p><p>Some personal-injury lawyers and academics have said that J&amp;J is abusing the bankruptcy system by shifting legal liabilities to a shell company with limited business operations. They have said LTL was created solely to benefit its owner and stockholders and to sap tort claimants' negotiating leverage</p><p>\"This is an attack on the American tort system,\" said Bruce Markell, a Northwestern Pritzker School of Law professor and retired bankruptcy judge who is among several academics urging a bankruptcy judge to dismiss LTL's chapter 11 case.</p><p>J&amp;J has denied that the restructuring was done in bad faith or will shortchange victims. The subsidiary in chapter 11 has a funding agreement with its parent company to cover any amounts it is deemed to owe.</p><p>A J&amp;J spokeswoman said that LTL's bankruptcy filing \"follows established process, and courts have uniformly acknowledged that equitably resolving these types of claims through chapter 11 is a legitimate use of the restructuring process.\"</p><p>J&amp;J said in 2020 it would stop selling its talcum-powder-based products in the U.S. and Canada, citing a decline in demand fueled by changing consumer habits and \"misinformation around the safety of the product and a constant barrage of litigation advertising.\" In court papers, J&amp;J has said it could face new talc lawsuits for decades to come.</p><p>Law firm Jones Day didn't respond to requests for comment about the legal strategy.</p><p>Willie Gregory, who said his wife, Sonna Gregory, died in May from ovarian cancer at the age of 59, said he was shocked when he learned of the bankruptcy filing by LTL. Mr. Gregory, 55, said his wife used Johnson's Baby Powder for nearly 30 years up until about 1990 and was diagnosed with cancer in 2016. A lawsuit they filed against J&amp;J in 2020, now on pause, blames the use of its talc-based products for the cancer developed by his wife, who was a longtime commissioner for Georgia's Clayton County.</p><p>\"It's almost like they're trying to brush it off and sweep it under the rug,\" said Mr. Gregory, a helicopter pilot with the Clayton County Police Department.</p><p>J&amp;J has denied liability in Mr. Gregory's lawsuit, one of his lawyers said. The J&amp;J spokeswoman said that Johnson's Baby Powder is safe and doesn't contain asbestos or cause cancer.</p><p>Chapter 11 allows companies facing asbestos claims to forge a settlement covering both pending claims and new injuries that arise years after exposure, a challenging task outside of bankruptcy. Bankruptcy courts can also value large numbers of tort claims collectively, giving defendants a court-imposed cap on aggregate payouts.</p><p>J&amp;J began exploring a bankruptcy strategy and moved its talc liabilities to a new subsidiary after the U.S. Supreme Court declined in June to review a $2.1 billion judgment in Missouri in favor of 20 women who blamed the company's baby powder for their ovarian cancer.</p><p>Michelle Ryan, J&amp;J's former treasurer, said in a July email to a Moody's Investors Inc. analyst that a chapter 11 strategy was a potential option for \"capping our talc liability, especially with the recent disappointing Supreme Court inaction,\" according to a copy of the email shown in bankruptcy court.</p><p>Ms. Ryan retired from J&amp;J in January, according to her LinkedIn page. While being questioned about the email during a January deposition, Ms. Ryan said uncertainty over the talc cases hurt J&amp;J's credit rating and that she used the term \"capping\" to describe the company's desire to have \"a defined liability.\"</p><p>Moody's declined to comment Monday.</p><p>LTL said when it filed for bankruptcy that J&amp;J offered $2 billion to settle all talc-related injury claims against J&amp;J. LTL said J&amp;J also gave it an equity interest in a royalty business worth $350 million. Robert Wuesthoff, a J&amp;J vice president who runs the LTL unit, said in a December deposition that filing for bankruptcy was \"a pretty common sense call\" and that the settlement offer is significant because J&amp;J stands behind the safety of its products and believes the talc lawsuits lack merit.</p><p>Mr. Wuesthoff said he thought the $2 billion offer \"was a great start, and hopefully, not even two billion is needed,\" according to court documents.</p><p>If LTL's bankruptcy case is dismissed, injury lawyers could resume litigating against J&amp;J around the country. Otherwise, they could be negotiating a settlement with J&amp;J or fighting in bankruptcy and appellate courts, potentially for years.</p><p>\"If the bankruptcy courts allow this to happen, they better create a whole new division and hire a bunch of new bankruptcy judges because every company will be doing it,\" said Roy Barnes, the former Georgia governor who represents Mr. Gregory and dozens of ovarian cancer victims suing J&amp;J.</p><p>LTL said its corporate predecessor incurred roughly $3.5 billion in indemnity payments before the chapter 11 filing. In court papers, LTL has described jury trials as a \"lottery like\" system, where a handful of personal-injury claimants win astronomical sums while others lose at trial and get nothing. J&amp;J has said a resolution of the litigation through chapter 11 is a fairer and quicker way to dispense compensation.</p><p>Some cancer patients are hoping their legal claims will provide payouts for their families after they die. California resident Vincent Hill died Sunday at age 56 after battling malignant mesothelioma, his lawyer said. Last month, Mr. Hill testified in bankruptcy court that he had put Johnson's Baby Powder on patients' bed linens after they finished bathing while working at Sutter General Hospital in Sacramento, Calif.</p><p>Mr. Hill had been scheduled to go to trial last December over his personal-injury lawsuit against J&amp;J, but a California judge postponed his case after J&amp;J moved his lawsuit and the others to chapter 11.</p><p>\"It's very important that I get a chance to tell my story,\" Mr. Hill said last month. He said he had been in hospice care and sought to provide financial security for his wife and 2-year-old daughter.</p><p>J&amp;J denied liability in Mr. Hill's lawsuit. A lawyer for J&amp;J during the bankruptcy hearing cited Mr. Hill's medical records, saying he smoked, could have been exposed to asbestos while working construction and that none of his physicians said his cancer was caused by J&amp;J's baby powder.</p><p>Although family members or estate representatives can continue lawsuits after someone dies, in some states, death itself wipes out some of a person's legal claims, such as for pain and suffering, according to plaintiffs' attorneys.</p><p>Judge Michael Kaplan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey said that while it was \"unfortunate and horrific\" that Mr. Hill was aware he likely wouldn't live to see a resolution to his lawsuit, it couldn't move forward because it would likely undermine the possibility of a broad settlement in the chapter 11 case filed by LTL.</p><p>Although asbestos lawsuits against J&amp;J are paused, chapter 11 has procedures to protect the interests of asbestos victims. A committee is representing claimants' in court and, if LTL's case proceeds, plaintiffs would have an opportunity to vote on any settlement. These procedures will likely motivate J&amp;J to negotiate with claimants and build support for any settlement proposal, said Samir Parikh, a law professor at the Lewis &amp; Clark Law School in Portland, Ore.</p><p>\"There are a number of parties at the table pushing back making sure their clients' interests are represented,\" Mr. Parikh said.</p><p>A pair of U.S. affiliates of Ireland's Trane Technologies holding legacy asbestos liabilities were put into chapter 11 in 2020 after they also underwent a Texas corporate restructuring. Separately, Saint-Gobain's CertainTeed LLC, a construction parts maker, carved off its asbestos liabilities in 2019, sending a new subsidiary holding those liabilities to chapter 11.</p><p>CertainTeed was \"seeking a less expensive way of dealing with these tort liabilities\" and turned to a strategy that its corporate representative said was \"driven not by businesspeople, but by lawyers,\" a bankruptcy judge ruled in August. The judge said that CertainTeed's corporate reshuffling had \"apparent negative effectsâ€¦on the legal rights of asbestos claimants\" but didn't conclude it broke the law. He made similar findings about Trane's use of chapter 11 later that month.</p><p>A Saint-Gobain spokesman said that its attempts to resolve asbestos litigation through a trust that would pay valid injury claims is consistent with bankruptcy law and will result in current and future plaintiffs receiving faster payments \"without the delay, stress and uncertainty of litigation in the tort system.\"</p><p>Georgia-Pacific, owned by Koch Industries Inc., also used Texas law to shift about 64,000 pending asbestos cases as well as future liability arising from past sales of gypsum plaster products into a subsidiary before placing it in chapter 11 in 2017. The unit, Bestwall LLC, has sought to put a price tag on its asbestos liabilities through estimation, the process available in bankruptcy court to collectively value mass torts. In estimation, legal and medical experts debate how much a company should pay to be done with a litigation for good.</p><p>Georgia-Pacific declined to comment. Trane didn't respond to requests for comment. These companies have said they put corporate affiliates into chapter 11 to fairly and equitably compensate asbestos victims and resolve costly litigation arising from asbestos-containing products they stopped producing decades ago.</p><p>Georgia-Pacific spent about $3 billion defending and resolving asbestos claims in the decades leading up to Bestwall's chapter 11 filing, court papers show. After the bankruptcy filing, a 10-member committee was formed to represent claimants who allege they were sickened by asbestos.</p><p>Five people on the original committee have died since the chapter 11 case began and have been replaced by their representatives. Bestwall and the committee have had negotiations but haven't agreed yet to a deal for how, and how much victims would be paid.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Randles at jonathan.randles@wsj.com</p>",
