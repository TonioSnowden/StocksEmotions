  "text": "<p>Investors are parsing earnings reports to determine how decades-high inflation is affecting corporate profits and consumer spending. Economists have been raising the estimated chances of a U.S. recession within the next 12 months, worried that the higher interest rates put in place by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation will weigh on growth.</p><p>Some investors, though, are on the lookout for signs that the economic picture might not be as dark as feared.</p><p>\"When you look at what's happening in the real economy through the lens of our customers, I'd say it's less than 50/50 that we end up with a recession at this point,\" said Bruce Van Saun, CEO of Citizens Financial Group, which reported earnings that beat expectations Tuesday.</p><p>Investors see bank earnings as a good way to determine the path of the broader economy, since their businesses closely track the health of consumers and businesses.</p><p>\"When we hear leaders say that inflation is under check or the general business climate is getting more hospitable, that's what markets react to positively,\" said Christopher McMahon, president and chief executive of Aquinas Wealth Advisors.</p><p>All of the S&amp;P's 11 sectors were trading higher. The materials and communications services sectors led the gains, up 3% and 2.9%, respectively. Travel and entertainment stocks also were bright spots, with Carnival, Caesars Entertainment and Expedia Group all up more than 5%.</p><p>Investors are paying close attention to comments companies make about plans to cut back on hiring or other investments. Some technology companies have already slowed hiring or cut jobs. Netflix results are due after the market close.</p><p>\"If the corporate sector starts to cut back on investment spending, that to me is the nail in the coffin,\" said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management.</p><p>Expectations for global growth and profits reached an all-time low in July, according to Tuesday's global fund manager survey from Bank of America.</p><p>\"Nobody is incentivized to be optimistic right now,\" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide Investment Management Group. \"The market is already positioned for extreme pessimism.\"</p><p>Shares of International Business Machines fell 6.7% after the technology company said shutting down its Russia operations and a strong dollar weighed on its quarterly results. Shares of Lockheed Martin edged up after the aerospace and defense contractor reported results that missed analysts' profit and sales estimates.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson shares lost 1.3%, reversing earlier gains after the pharmaceutical and consumer health products company reported a profit and sales that beat expectations but reduced its earnings outlook for the year. Shares of Halliburton rose 1.7% after the oil services company beat profit and revenue expectations.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 3.017% from 2.959% Monday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, fell about 1% to $107.39 a barrel.</p><p>And among currencies, the euro, which hit parity with the dollar last week, rose 1% to $1.0243. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, fell 0.6%. The greenback has surged against other currencies this year as investors shelter from falling stocks and bet on U.S. economic resilience.</p><p>The European Central Bank is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in 11 years at its meeting Thursday. Typically, interest-rate increases cause currencies to strengthen because investors are paid more to invest in those assets.</p><p>Officials are expected to discuss raising interest rates by half a percentage point, The Wall Street Journal reported. Economists, though, still expect a quarter-percentage-point increase, in line with what ECB President Christine Legarde has signaled.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gained 1.4%. Shares of Electricite de France jumped 15% in Paris trading after the French government said that it plans to pay about 9.7 billion euros to take full control of the energy company.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes were mixed. China's Shanghai Composite was flat, and Japan's Nikkei 225 added almost 0.7%. South Korea's Kospi edged down 0.2%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.9%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Orla McCaffrey at orla.mccaffrey@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Rises More Than 500 Points as Investors Seek Clues From Earnings</p>",
