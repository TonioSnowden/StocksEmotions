  "title": "Covid-19 Vaccine Boosters' Mix-and-Match Efficacy; NIH study suggests which booster is most effective depending on whether you got the Moderna, Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson shot",
  "text": "<p>The study enrolled 458 participants and divided them into three groups. Each group included some people who had received at least 15 days earlier the mRNA-vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and from Moderna, as well as some who'd received J&amp;J's viral-vector vaccine.</p><p>Researchers gave the first group a booster dose from Moderna (which is half the dose of each of the first two shots in the Moderna series). The second group got the Pfizer-BioNTech booster, and the third group got a second dose of J&amp;J's single-dose vaccine for their booster.</p><p>The study found that combining different vaccines was safe, with fatigue and muscle aches the most common side effects. It also found that the boosters increased antibody levels no matter the combination. Here are some differences, grouped by participants' original vaccine type.</p><p>Moderna vaccine: Booster combinations and side effects</p><p>Subjects originally vaccinated with two shots of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine saw boosted immune responses 15 days after receiving third shots from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech or J&amp;J. Some side effects were more common among people who received the Moderna booster.</p><p>Similarly, an earlier study from Moderna found that about 170 people receiving a smaller third dose of the Moderna vaccine as a booster saw an average 13-fold rise in antibodies for the original Covid-19 strain, and a 17-fold rise against the Delta variant.</p><p>Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine: Booster combinations and side effects</p><p>In participants who originally got two shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, the study found a third dose was safe and boosted average antibodies. For this group, a boost of Moderna showed a 32-fold increase in antibodies, compared with a 20-fold increase for a third shot of Pfizer and a 12.5-fold increase from a J&amp;J booster.</p><p>A separate, larger study of 10,000 participants conducted by Pfizer found that a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine generated a stronger immune response than the original two-dose course.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine: Booster combinations and side effects</p><p>For people who were vaccinated with the single-dose J&amp;J vaccine, one booster combination delivered a much weaker antibody boost than the rest: not mixing. On average, a second shot of the J&amp;J vaccine boosted antibodies 4-fold, while a booster dose of Moderna increased antibodies 76-fold, and a Pfizer-BioNTech booster raised them 35-fold.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration have backed a booster of any kind for people 18 years and older at least two months after they received the J&amp;J vaccine. Some CDC panel members preferred that J&amp;J vaccine recipients get an extra dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna rather than another dose of J&amp;J.</p><p>Write to Ana Rivas at ana.rivas@wsj.com</p><p>Covid-19 Vaccine Boosters' Mix-and-Match Efficacy</p>",
