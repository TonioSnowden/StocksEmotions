  "text": "<p><em>How closely did you follow the news in 2021?&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/2021-in-review-quiz/\"><em>Take our quiz</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Hello and welcome to a new year.</p> <p>I am starting 2022 by looking a little further ahead than usual, outlining events set to happen over the next 12 months. Think of it is a forward planner diary for the coming year.</p> <p>If there is an overarching theme — apart from the further evolution of Covid — then it is going to be national leadership. We will be aware of the venerability, and vulnerability, of our presidents, prime ministers and other heads of state in 2022. </p> <p>Perhaps most notable, at least because of the time she has been in the job, is the milestone about to be reached by the Queen. In February, health permitting, she will have reigned for 70 years, the longest of any British monarch. A cluster of jubilee celebrations have been planned for the following months, which organisers hope will lift the Covid-damped mood of many Britons, including a contest to create new cities. Could it even aid the country's economic recovery?</p> <p>Across the Channel, Emmanuel Macron will be trying to sustain his own period in office through the French presidential elections, which kick off in April. With France having just taken the revolving presidency of the Council of the EU, Macron will be able to use a pan-European stage to project his authority to his domestic audience.</p> <p>US president Joe Biden has to worry about his party's hold on power in Washington with midterm elections looming in November. It currently looks like an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9583b724-ee20-4908-b36b-3962d07ff6b8\">opportunity for Republicans</a> to end Democrat control of one or both houses of Congress.</p> <p>It will be a significant year also for China's leadership, but for different reasons. In October, President Xi Jinping will — barring a major upset — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c0a12f3-bc3a-4d13-b9f7-302f3f6dc59b\">be anointed as a latter-day emperor</a> at the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist party with a ruling enabling him to remain in office until at least 2028.</p> <p>Hopefully you will find this skeleton guide to the next 12 months useful — as ever, you can email me at jonathan.moules@ft.com with your views. The Week Ahead will return to its normal structure next Sunday. I wish you a prosperous new year and look forward to returning with the usual weekly guide on January 9.</p> <h1>Key economic, company and world events</h1> <h2>January</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Change at the top of <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong>.
