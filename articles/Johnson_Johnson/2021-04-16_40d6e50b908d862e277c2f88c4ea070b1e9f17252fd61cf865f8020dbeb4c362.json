  "text": "<p>The EU's vaccination rollout is picking up pace, with the bloc hitting a milestone of 100m administered jabs this week. But that headline figure masks growing disparities within the continent, as Europe's richer, better-supplied countries race ahead of the rest.</p> <p>Germany on Wednesday vaccinated nearly 740,000 people, a daily record in the EU's largest member state. In Belgium, more than 550,000 jabs were administered last week, a record; the country's total stands at more than 2m. France is consistently hitting <a href=\"https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/actualites/presse/communiques-de-presse/article/vaccination-contre-la-covid-en-france-au-13-avril-2021-pres-de-15-320-000\">more than 450,000</a> jabs a day.&#xa0;</p> <p>By contrast, Bulgaria and Latvia are chronically lagging behind — and the gap is growing. The latest figures circulated to EU diplomats on Thursday showed that only 8.5 doses have been administered per 100 people in Bulgaria. That compares with 48.5 in the EU's best-performing country, Malta, and an EU average of 22.7 per 100 (see chart below).&#xa0;</p> <p>The EU has tried to narrow the vaccination gap with a “solidarity” mechanism that will provide <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a7de304-f692-4e65-af47-08fa9e53be8d\">five countries with 2.85m</a> additional doses in the coming weeks. But fraught negotiations over the extra jabs have blown open internal tensions over vaccine distribution. During the talks, Austria, Slovenia and the Czech Republic demanded additional shares but were eventually cut out of the final deal after trying to block it in protest.</p> <p>Despite Vienna's caustic criticism of the EU's vaccine distribution scheme, Austria is among Europe's top vaccination performers, with 24.2 shots administered per 100 people. The Czech Republic and Slovenia, however, remain below the bloc's average.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Czech prime minister Andrej Babis last week lambasted the rotating Portuguese presidency of the EU, calling it a “puppet of larger member states” and the distribution a “scandal” that “cheated” his country.&#xa0;</p> <p>Europe's rich-poor disparity risks getting worse before it gets better. Poorer countries such as Bulgaria have been left short of vaccines in large part because of their over-reliance on the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, which has been beset by production delays and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5251e1b9-b88d-4bfc-95fa-29dc34d37652\">concerns over side-effects</a>.</p> <p>The decision this week by Johnson &amp; Johnson to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1070ff2-a473-4f6a-a484-681fb8de4251\">temporarily suspend</a> its one-shot jab in Europe has meant the EU has been forced to fill the gap with additional supplies of the more expensive BioNTech/Pfizer shot, which has proved to be out of the price range of many poorer states. </p> <p>Bulgaria's prime minister Boyko Borisov has <a href=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/short_news/bulgarian-pm-price-of-pfizer-vaccine-jumps-from-e12-to-e1950/\">bemoaned the cost</a> of the Pfizer jabs going up from a range of €12-15 to €19.50 in newer contracts for delivery in 2022 and 2023. </p> <p>Brussels' centralised vaccine strategy was designed to help prevent a descent into vaccine nationalism, where poorer countries risked losing out to the rich. Events since have shown that closing the EU's great jab divide is not so easily fixed. </p> <h1>Chart du jour: climbing a debt mountain </h1> <p>Public debt has reached eye-watering levels, with the Institute of International Finance estimating the pile of global borrowing at $281tn. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/edcaecb2-5f83-4909-9d96-cb4daa0f0401\">The FT's John Plender</a> believes the world is in a debt trap, with central banks unable to adjust fiscal policy without putting financial stability at risk.
