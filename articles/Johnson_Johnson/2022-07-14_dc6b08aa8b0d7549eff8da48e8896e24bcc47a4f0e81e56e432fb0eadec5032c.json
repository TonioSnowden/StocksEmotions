  "title": "FDA Delays Approval Decision on Cancer Drug From China; The agency says it can't approve a esophageal cancer drug from Novartis and BeiGene without completing inspections in China",
  "text": "<p>The FDA had originally set Tuesday as its deadline for a decision on the BeiGene drugs. But BeiGene said Thursday the FDA has been unable to conduct required inspections in China due to the Covid restrictions. The FDA hasn't given a new expected decision date.</p><p>\"We are working with our partner, Novartis, to facilitate the required inspections and bring tislelizumab to patients with second-line esophageal cancer in the U.S. following regulatory approval,\" said BeiGene Chief Executive John V. Oyler.</p><p>A Novartis spokeswoman said the companies will continue to work closely with the FDA to schedule the inspections as soon as possible. The companies didn't specify the nature of the required FDA inspections; the FDA typically inspects manufacturing plants and clinical-trial sites in its reviews of proposed new drugs.</p><p>Analysts said that while the delay is a setback, the FDA didn't signal any concerns about the clinical-trial data for the drug, and it could still get approval once the inspections are completed.</p><p>Tislelizumab is known as an immunotherapy, which works by harnessing the body's immune system to fight tumors. The drug is approved in China and in use there for lung cancer and some other cancers.</p><p>A late-stage study of the drug, conducted in 35 countries, showed that adding it to chemotherapy extended median overall survival of esophageal-cancer patients to 17.2 months, versus 10.6 months for patients on chemotherapy alone.</p><p>Chinese authorities have imposed strict lockdowns in various regions this year in efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p>The delay for the BeiGene/Novartis drug is the latest setback for drug companies' efforts to introduce to U.S. patients drugs that were developed in China and initially tested there.</p><p>This year, FDA officials have tapped the brakes on approving such drugs, citing concerns about the quality of studies largely conducted in China, and whether the results can apply to patients in the U.S.</p><p>So far this year, the FDA has rejected three proposed new cancer drugs that were tested in China.</p><p>The agency in March rejected a proposed new lung-cancer drug from Eli Lilly and Co. and its Chinese partner Innovent Biologics Inc., after advisers said a Chinese study of the drug had shortcomings and that more testing should be done.</p><p>And the FDA in May rejected two proposed new cancer drugs that were developed in China, one from Hutchmed Ltd. and another from Shanghai Junshi Biosciences Co. and its U.S.-based partner Coherus BioSciences Inc.</p><p>Hutchmed said the FDA determined that two Chinese studies, and one aimed at showing the drug would also work in U.S. patients, didn't support approval at this time. The FDA also cited difficulties scheduling inspections in China due to pandemic restrictions.</p><p>The FDA asked Junshi and Coherus to change a quality-related process for the drug, the companies said.</p><p>The FDA did, however, approve a new cancer treatment from Johnson &amp; Johnson and its Chinese partner Legend Biotech Corp., which was initially developed in China but was later tested in American patients to confirm its safety and efficacy. That approval signaled that FDA is open to approving China-originated drugs if they are also tested in other countries.</p><p>FDA Delays Approval Decision on Cancer Drug From China</p>",
