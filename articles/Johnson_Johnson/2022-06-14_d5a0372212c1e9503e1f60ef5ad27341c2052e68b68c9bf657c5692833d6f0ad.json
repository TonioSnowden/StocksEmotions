  "title": "Private-Equity Firms Pour $500 Million Into ESG Ratings Company EcoVadis; General Atlantic's climate-investment arm and Paris-based firm Astorg led the Series C investment round",
  "text": "<p>Founded in 2007, EcoVadis provides ratings and benchmarking for companies based on environmental, social and governance factors. The Paris-based company said it has about 1,300 employees and that its revenue grew by 50% in the past 12 months. Its customers include online retailer Amazon.com Inc., drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson and cosmetics giant L'Oréal SA, among many others.</p><p>The company didn't disclose the enterprise value used in the latest investment round.</p><p>Frédéric Trinel, EcoVadis co-founder and co-chief executive, said his company is distinguished from others in the crowded field of ESG ratings in part because it assesses the sustainability performance of a company's providers and supply chain, giving a broader picture of the full ESG impact of the business.</p><p>\"You cannot ignore the performance of partners in ESG,\" Mr. Trinel said. \"We have been able to solve this critical challenge of the suppliers' performance, regardless of size or industry sector.\"</p><p>Rating ESG performance has become a big business as governments and regulators in both Europe and the U.S. push to require companies to back up their claims about environmental and social benefits. Regulators want to combat so-called greenwashing, or the promotion of investment products based on unsupported claims of their environmental or social impact.</p><p>In the U.S., for instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission last month proposed broadening the disclosures required of funds with an ESG focus, including such details as the greenhouse-gas emissions of their investments.</p><p>With the latest investment, EcoVadis has now received a total of about $725 million from investors. Previous backers include CVC Growth Partners, the growth-investment arm of London private-equity giant CVC Capital Partners, and management consulting firm Bain &amp; Co. CVC remains the company's largest institutional backer.</p><p>French venture-capital firm Partech Ventures, which backed EcoVadis in 2016, cashed out its investment in the latest round, Mr. Trinel said.</p><p>EcoVadis intends to use the new capital in part to pursue mergers and acquisitions, with the goal of launching an initial public offering in the next three to four years, Mr. Trinel said.</p><p>New York growth-equity firm General Atlantic launched BeyondNetZero last year, and has announced four investments so far, said Rhea Hamilton, a managing director on the BeyondNetZero team. One aspect of EcoVadis that attracted the firm is that it has managed to reach a significant size in the fractured market for ESG ratings, she said.</p><p>The market for ESG benchmarking \"is an area that we have mapped very closely, and this company was the one that rose to the top,\" Ms. Hamilton said.</p><p>Write to Chris Cumming at chris.cumming@wsj.com</p>",
