  "text": "<p>   Emergent BioSolutions Inc. disclosed a shake-up among its senior executives in the wake of problems manufacturing Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine at its Baltimore plant. </p><p>   The personnel moves come a week after the Food and Drug Administration said its inspectors found that Emergent failed to keep clean, sanitary conditions and failed to take proper steps to prevent contamination at the plant. </p><p>   Cross-contamination, in which viral material from AstraZeneca PLC's Covid-19 vaccine was transmitted to the production area for J&amp;J's vaccine, ruined a batch of J&amp;J's vaccine, Emergent Chief Executive Robert Kramer said on an earnings conference call Thursday. </p><p>   Mr. Kramer said Emergent plans to submit within days a plan to address the FDA's inspection findings. \"If the FDA is comfortable with the approach we propose, I am hopeful that we can soon return to producing the tens of millions of doses per month,\" he said. </p><p>   Syed Husain, senior vice president and head of Emergent's contract development and manufacturing unit, will leave Emergent to pursue another opportunity, Mr. Kramer said. Sean Kirk, executive vice president of manufacturing and technical operations, will take a personal leave of absence, Mr. Kramer said. Messrs. Husain and Kirk declined to comment through a company spokesman. </p><p>   Mary Oates, Emergent's senior vice president of global quality, will now report directly to Mr. Kramer, he said. Adam Havey, executive vice president of business operations, will assume full responsibility for manufacturing. </p><p></p>",
