  "title": "S&P 500 Hits Highest Close In Weeks on Strong Earnings --- Investors assess how companies are faring with inflation, supply chain issues",
  "text": "<p>\"I wouldn't say the fog has been lifted or the fear is gone, but at least you've got some reasonably positive data points,\" he said.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gained 33.17 points, or 0.7%, to 4519.63, off 0.4% from its record in early September. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 198.70 points, or 0.6% to 35457.31, its highest close in two months. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 107.28 points, or 0.7%, to 15129.09.</p><p>Third-quarter earnings season is in its early days, with about 10% of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported. Of those, roughly four out of five have beaten profit forecasts, according to FactSet.</p><p>Traders rewarded some of the companies that reported Tuesday. Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson rose $3.75, or 2.3%, to $163.87 after the company logged a larger profit in its third quarter than a year earlier, lifted by higher sales in its pharmaceutical, medical-device and consumer-health divisions.</p><p>Travelers shares climbed $2.51, or 1.6%, to $155.39 after the insurance company beat estimates for revenue and core income per share.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble shares, meanwhile, fell $1.68, or 1.2%, to $140.66 after the consumer-product powerhouse said it was raising prices on a host of household staples, as costs for freight and raw materials rose faster than anticipated.</p><p>Inflation is expected to be stickier than originally anticipated by central-bank officials, exacerbated by continued supply-chain disruptions, higher energy costs and labor shortages. Some investors expect supply problems will pinch companies' sales.</p><p>\"Will the market look through some of these supply constrained sales shortfalls?\" asked Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \"I think the market should, because I don't think the consumer is going to walk away and not buy even if they have to wait a month or two.\"</p><p>Ten of the 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500 advanced, led by the healthcare and utilities groups, while consumer discretionary stocks pulled back.</p><p>Bitcoin's dollar value rose 4.35% from its 5 p.m. ET level Monday, trading at $64,120.38.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked up to 1.634% from 1.583% Monday. Yields rise when bond prices fall.</p><p>Fresh data showed that construction of new homes in the U.S. decreased in September after rising in August. Builders have been caught between strong demand from buyers -- spurred in part by low interest rates -- and shortages of materials, labor and lots.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.3%, while most major indexes in Asia closed higher.</p><p>Early Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei was up 0.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.9% but the Shanghai Composite was down 0.3%. U.S. stock futures were down less than 0.1%.</p>",
