  "text": "<p>The agency is closing in on the booster-shot authorization amid evidence that vaccines are less effective protecting immunocompromised people from Covid-19 than they are in protecting the general population.</p><p>Some public-health experts and vaccine makers have also recommended boosters as necessary for broader swaths of the population to keep strong protection against newer variants of the coronavirus and because some preliminary research indicates vaccines may lose effectiveness over time.</p><p>The Biden administration is expected to lay out a plan for boosters by early September.</p><p>Some countries, including Israel, have authorized booster shots for the immunocompromised and older adults.</p><p>Last month, an expert panel advising the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signaled preliminary support for giving extra doses to immunocompromised people.</p><p>Three Covid-19 vaccines are authorized for use in the U.S. Shots from Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE and from Moderna Inc. require two doses for full protection, while the vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson involves a single dose.</p><p>Pfizer has said it plans to ask U.S. regulators to authorize booster shots of its two-dose vaccine this month while Moderna has said it plans to do so next month. Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to release data about the efficacy of two doses of its single-shot vaccine this month.</p><p>The Delta variant has spread rapidly throughout the U.S. in recent weeks. Health authorities blame it for increasing cases across the U.S., especially among people who haven't gotten vaccinated.</p><p>About 2.7% of American adults are immunocompromised, which includes people who have been given transplants, live with HIV or take cancer treatments that suppress their immune system.</p>",
