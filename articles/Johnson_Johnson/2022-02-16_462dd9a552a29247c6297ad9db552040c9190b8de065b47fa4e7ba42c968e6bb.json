  "title": "J&J Could Increase $2 Billion Talc Settlement Offer, Lawyer Says; A lawyer for a bankrupt J&J subsidiary said the $2 billion offer is the starting point for negotiations and could increase if the chapter 11 case proceeds",
  "text": "<p>\"We hope to have a mediation, to come to a consensus and a plan, to get the appropriate amount put in to resolve these cases,\" Mr. Kim testified</p><p>during the third day of trial  in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Trenton, N.J.</p><p>Judge Michael Kaplan is considering injury claimants' request to dismiss the J&amp;J subsidiary from chapter 11 on the grounds that the bankruptcy was filed in bad faith to gain an unfair litigation advantage. J&amp;J and its subsidiary have denied the allegation and said bankruptcy will provide plaintiffs a fairer forum for quickly resolving about 38,000 talc-injury lawsuits as well as future claims.</p><p>Personal-injury lawyers have alleged the talc in Johnson's Baby Powder can cause ovarian cancer and contains asbestos, which J&amp;J denies. It stopped selling the product  in the U.S. and Canada in 2020 as the tort litigation grew.</p><p>Mr. Kim was questioned about J&amp;J's response to the litigation over two days on the witness stand. On Tuesday, Mr. Kim testified that J&amp;J was close last year to settling most of its talc liability for between $4 billion and $5 billion .</p><p>The deal, which involved the bankruptcy case of J&amp;J's former talc supplier, fell apart in May or June, Mr. Kim said. J&amp;J considered a corporate reshuffling that led to LTL's chapter 11 filing after the Supreme Court in June declined to review a $2.1 billion judgment in Missouri for 20 women who alleged the baby powder caused ovarian cancer. J&amp;J has denied liability and said its talc products are safe.</p><p>Lawyers on Wednesday also played excerpts from an S&amp;P Global Inc . analyst's videotaped deposition in which he said the LTL chapter 11 could help J&amp;J's credit rating by quantifying the talc liability.</p><p>The trial is expected to conclude this week. Judge Kaplan has said he intends to rule by the end of the month on whether to dismiss LTL's case.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p>",
