  "title": "World News:  U.S. to Share Vaccines Through Covax  ---  Biden administration  to work with program  to export 80 million  doses by end of June  ----  By Tarini Parti and Brianna Abbott",
  "text": "<p>\n  The Biden administration said it would work through the international Covax effort to share the bulk of the 80 million Covid-19 vaccine doses it plans to send to other countries by the end of June. </p><p>\n  Officials had previously announced the number of doses they would be sending overseas, but they hadn't detailed where they would be going. Dozens of countries, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, petitioned the U.S. for a portion of the doses. </p><p>\n  About 75% of the vaccines will go to Covax, a multibillion-dollar program to immunize the world against Covid-19 that has been struggling with supply, and they will be targeted to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, South and Southeast Asia, and Africa, in coordination with the African Union, the White House said. </p><p>\n  The remaining 25% will go to countries experiencing surges in cases, neighbors and those who have requested help from the U.S. </p><p>\n  \"As long as this pandemic is raging anywhere in the world, the American people will still be vulnerable,\" President Biden said Thursday. </p><p>\n  The Biden administration's announcement comes as demand for vaccines declines in the U.S. and many developing countries continue to struggle with containing Covid-19 outbreaks and emerging variants. </p><p>\n  The administration had initially said it planned to share 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine, following a safety review by the Food and Drug Administration, and 20 million doses from Moderna Inc., Pfizer Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson, whose shots are being given to people in the U.S. </p><p>\n  Since the AstraZeneca vaccine is still under review, officials on Thursday said the first 25 million doses shared will come from the federal pool of doses of the three vaccines being administered in the U.S. </p><p>\n  The administration said of those first 25 million doses it ships overseas, the biggest chunk will go to South and Central American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, and Guatemala; countries in Asia, including India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka; and to Africa, with countries that will be selected in coordination with the African Union. </p><p>\n  It said about six million doses in that first tranche will go to partners and regional priorities including Mexico, Canada, South Korea, West Bank and Gaza, and United Nations front-line workers. </p><p>\n  The administration is also working with vaccine producers to build out capacity and plans to send more surplus doses overseas, officials said. </p><p>\n  Nearly 63% of U.S. adults have received at least one dose of a vaccine and 52% are fully vaccinated, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p>\n  Covid-19 cases, deaths and hospitalizations have been falling significantly as more people have been getting vaccinated. </p><p>\n  Meanwhile, in countries like India and Brazil much smaller portions of the population have been vaccinated and the virus is continuing to spread, leading to high daily death tolls. </p><p>\n  This year, the U.S. said it would send a total of four million AstraZeneca doses, which officials described as a loan, to Mexico and Canada. Mr. Biden also announced a plan in February to eventually send a total of $4 billion to Covax. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Effort Falls Short </p><p>\n  Of Ambitious Goals </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Covax, a multibillion-dollar program to immunize the world against Covid-19, has run into a series of hurdles in sending vaccines to countries most in need. It had targeted to ship 238 million doses by the end of May and had scheduled to vaccinate the developing world's healthcare workforce at this point, but had sent out just 72 million shots as of May 26. </p><p>\n  The program's staff had hoped that wealthy countries would buy enough vaccines for at least 10% of their populations through the program in order to help subsidize the vaccines for poorer nations, along with direct donations. But many wealthy countries, including some that had promised to fund Covax, bought their own doses directly rather than through the collective pool. </p><p>\n  Some countries also had complicated requests or requirements that slowed down deals. </p><p>\n  The program ended up heavily leaning on the Serum Institute of India, which has been overrun by the world's worst Covid-19 outbreak. </p><p>\n  Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national-security adviser, said the U.S. would work closely with Covax and the countries receiving the doses. The U.S. will decide where to send the vaccines through Covax in consultation with the program's officials on their logistics and delivery capacity, he said. </p><p></p>",
