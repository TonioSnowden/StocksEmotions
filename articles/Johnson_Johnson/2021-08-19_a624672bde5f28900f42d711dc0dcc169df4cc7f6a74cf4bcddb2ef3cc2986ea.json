  "text": "<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson announced that Joaquin Duato would take over as chief executive from his mentor Alex Gorsky, who is stepping aside in early January after almost a decade in the role.</p> <p>Gorsky will serve as executive chair and hand over the reins to his longtime protégé on January 3, capping a career of more than 30 years.</p> <p>He said that after helping the company deliver strong performances across its businesses during his tenure and positioning it for “continued success”, it was the right time to step aside “due to family health reasons”.</p> <p>More recently, Gorsky was forced to address manufacturing problems that tarnished J&amp;J's consumer health business as well as the company's<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4eddc22-cd86-11e9-99a4-b5ded7a7fe3f\"> alleged role</a> in the US opioid epidemic and lawsuits related to its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d16d6df6-e6e0-4db2-88bf-02ae76b9fca3\">talcum powder products</a>.</p> <p>Duato, who has also been at the company for more than three decades, is the vice-chair of J&amp;J's executive committee. From 2018, he added responsibilities for the company's consumer business, global supply chain, technology and health and wellness teams to his duties as head of J&amp;J's pharmaceuticals unit. More recently, he has overseen J&amp;J's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Gorsky said he had the “utmost confidence” in Duato, who holds US and Spanish citizenship, to lead J&amp;J. “Over our more than 25 years of working together, he has always demonstrated a passion for solving complex medical and business challenges,” the outgoing chief said in a statement.</p> <p>Steering the company through the pandemic will remain a priority for Duato, given global outbreaks of highly transmissible variants and the debate about the necessity of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b003e7a2-6f3c-4f3d-8a95-20dd6fa976ea\">booster shots</a>. </p> <p>Although J&amp;J's share price was trading at almost record levels, its efforts to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3da0286-ec0b-4cdb-8c42-805205410f06\">win public trust</a> during the public health crisis have been bumpier than those of other drugmakers. </p> <p>Reports in the early months of the global vaccine rollout of “rare and severe” blood clots in some recipients prompted several health agencies around the world to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87a9c833-dae2-4ad0-9f29-13899d671fed\">temporarily pause</a> the use of the company's single-shot doses.</p> <p>Separately, a batch of its vaccines produced at a plant in Baltimore was ruined due to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc05beba-ef13-4db6-8bb0-ffc4ed94df29\">factory error</a>.</p><p>Source: Peter Wells in New York 2021 'J&amp;J veteran Joaquin Duato to take over as chief executive' FT.com 19 August.
