  "title": "As Beijing Olympics Approach, Omicron Heightens Pressure on Vaccines; Chinese organizers \"strongly encourage\" Games participants to receive a booster shot.",
  "text": "<p>\"While we strongly encourage Games participants to receive a booster shot, any requirement to have one is according to the requirement of the participant's country/region of residence or national health authority where the vaccine was administered,\" the playbook said.</p><p>The rising Covid case count is suddenly adding additional complexity to planning for Beijing 2022, which is now just weeks away.</p><p>The U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee, which is expected to send one of the largest delegations to the Winter Olympics, said Friday it was encouraging booster shots for Team USA. Chief executive Sarah Hirshland said that it was stopping short of a mandate \"at this point\" in part because some athletes had only recently received their initial vaccinations, making it too soon for them to be eligible for boosting. The U.S. had earlier in the fall required vaccination for participants weeks ahead of Beijing effectively requiring it.</p><p>A spokesman for the International Olympic Committee referred to the Covid playbooks for Beijing and added: \"Pre-departure testing, the vaccination policy, a 'closed loop' management system and regular on-site testing are among the vital elements that will enable the Games to take place safely.\"</p><p>Some epidemiologists have said a booster shot is the best available line of defense against the Omicron variant, which appears to be more transmissible and capable of infecting people even if they have been vaccinated against Covid.</p><p>The next phase of the pandemic is rapidly becoming reality in the United States, where almost three quarters of the population has received at least one vaccine dose from Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson &amp; Johnson, but only about one quarter of fully vaccinated people has received a booster shot. The question is when it will hit China.</p><p>And with border closures in Asia, Christmas on hold in much of Europeand awave of cancellations spreading across North America, some kind of disruption to the Games suddenly feels more possible than it has at any point in the past year.</p><p>China's no-tolerance approach to the virus, dubbed \"Covid zero,\"had already spurred a tough stance from organizers on vaccination in which most athletes, officials and reporters going to the Games will need to show they have their shots or plan for a 21-day quarantine on arrival.</p><p>Beijing 2022 organizers had also previously said they would confine the Games and all participants to a \"closed loop\" from the moment of arrival until the moment of departure – effectively shutting them off from any interactions with the Chinese population – and bar international spectators.</p><p>But the Omicron variant's capacity to be quickly transmitted even among people who have been vaccinated against the coronavirus has reintroduced a new element of uncertainty to major events across the world – particularly in places where officials have indicated they will not accept unchecked spread of the virus.</p><p>China also may be uniquely vulnerable to the Omicron variant given its pandemic strategy and its preferred vaccine. The first study of blood samples from people who had received two doses of the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac's vaccine suggested that it would be ineffective at preventing infection from the Omicron variant.</p><p>The variant's capacity to break through Covid vaccines' protection against moderate and severe illness has not yet been fully determined, although early indications have suggested that most vaccinated people are not getting sick from the virus even if they are testing positive for it.</p><p>That has sparked some increased risk tolerance in American professional sports hard-hit this week by breakthrough infections such as the National Football League. The NFL said Thursday it would step up measures to prevent the transmission of the virus but let fully vaccinated players who do test positive but have no symptoms return quickly to the field.</p><p>Still, Beijing organizers have shown no sign that they will back down from a strict policy of testing every Games participant daily for the virus, with a positive result potentially leading to a person entering weekslong quarantine.</p><p>That could unlock new fears for some countries and their national Olympic committees. In the U.S., lawmakers critical of China had already warned that they did not believe American athletes would be safe at the Beijing Olympics, even without taking into account the quarantine possibility.</p><p>Those claims exploded after fears for the safety of Chinese tennis player and Olympian Peng Shuai in the wake of an allegation that appeared on Peng's verified account on the Twitter-like platform Weibo that a retired top official in China's Communist Party had sexually assaulted her. Some politicians have argued that poor treatment of a revered Chinese athlete bodes even worse for Americans. USOPC officials did not comment on those concerns in the context of a potential quarantine Friday.</p><p>Not all countries have such fears, though, including Norway, which topped the unofficial medal table of the last Winter Olympics. Tore Øvrebø, the chef de mission for Team Norway, said in written answers to The Wall Street Journal that \"the risk of getting infected will be there, but we trust in the Chinese authorities and the organizers' handling of the situation.\"</p><p>Øvrebø also said that he was not sure the Norwegians would pursue booster shots.</p><p>\"A number of athletes got their second dose of vaccine less than five months ago, so for a group of athletes there will be limited time for the third, the booster. Reports say you may have reduced performance level after [a] vaccine, so this must be taken into consideration.\"</p><p>—Ben Cohen and Liyan Qi contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com and Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com</p><p>As Beijing Olympics Approach, Omicron Heightens Pressure on Vaccines</p>",
