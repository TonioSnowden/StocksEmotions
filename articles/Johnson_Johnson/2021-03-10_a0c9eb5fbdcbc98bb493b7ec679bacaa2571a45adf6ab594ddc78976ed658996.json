  "text": "<p>The long-awaited Conference on the Future of Europe is set to be signed off by the EU's three institutions in a subdued ceremony designed to have as few people as possible notice it's happening.&#xa0;</p> <p>The presidents of the European Commission, parliament and the rotating presidency of the EU Council will put their names to an inter-institutional agreement on Wednesday morning to launch the Conference on May 9.&#xa0;</p> <p>The agreement will put an end to months of wrangling between member states and MEPs over who should run the project, which was initially envisioned as a grassroots experiment in direct democracy that would help shape the future direction of the union.&#xa0;</p> <p>The reality is likely to be less grand. The Conference has morphed into a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2e27ae6-9094-424c-9786-768d767ccfb6\">bureaucrat-heavy</a> exercise that will “belong” to all three Brussels' institutions, and in the process probably be owned by none.&#xa0;</p> <p>The involvement of citizens, rather than technocrats, was supposed to be the main draw. But many voters would be hard pushed to tell you what the exercise is for. <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1025\">A Eurobarometer survey</a> published on Tuesday found that only 51 per cent of Europeans said they would take part in the Conference.&#xa0;</p> <p>The raison d'être of the Conference — and perhaps the main measure by which it could still be deemed successful — is to engage often apathetic voters across the continent about their views on the EU. But warring policymakers have abjectly failed to communicate what the point of the format is. </p> <p>Conference enthusiasts are holding out hope that the imminent launch of a digital platform for civil society and private citizens to contribute their thoughts will build momentum behind the exercise. As of yet, the precise themes or subjects up for debate have not been decided by the executives in charge.&#xa0;</p> <p>What won't be on the agenda is the prospect of a future EU treaty change on the back of the Conference's findings. That idea was roundly rejected by member states last year. </p> <p>Debates over how to organise the next EU elections, the introduction of transnational parliamentary seats or the future of the sporadic <em>Spitzenkandidaten </em>system for appointing a commission president are also likely to be relegated. “No one outside Brussels cares about these issues,” said one EU official.&#xa0;</p> <p>Instead, health policy, the post-pandemic economy and climate change are expected to be among the themes put to participants.&#xa0;The exercise will run for less than a year, concluding next spring at the request of the incoming French presidency of the Council, which wants to present the findings. </p> <p>At best, the exercise may serve as a useful experiment in deliberative democracy as seen in France's citizens' conventions or Ireland's <a href=\"https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PaperDetails/40012\">mini-assemblies</a> on constitutional questions.&#xa0;At worst, it may end up a wasted opportunity that shuts the door on institutional and political reform at a time when the EU is taking steps <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b69c9c4-2ea4-4635-9d8a-1b67852c0322\">towards fiscal integration</a>.</p> <p>Some observers have run out of patience with the Conference already. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/mar/09/will-the-eu-emerge-from-the-coronavirus-crisis-stronger-or-weaker\">Historian Timothy Garton Ash</a> is among those calling for the “orgy of introspection” to be scrapped:&#xa0;</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“If European leaders really care about the future of Europe, they will start by abandoning the Conference on the Future of Europe. Instead, they will focus on what the EU can actually do for its citizens.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h1>Chart du jour: Locked down in Lombardy </h1> <p>Italy's Lombardy was the first region in Europe to be placed under lockdown just over a year ago.

A UK government spokesman said claims of “a UK export ban or any restrictions on vaccines are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d28903d-3723-45cc-878a-21e1f2d39493\">completely false</a>”.
