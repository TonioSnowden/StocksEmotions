  "text": "<p>   Since the lockdown orders of a year ago, Americans have made enormous sacrifices, complying with government guidance on masking and social distancing in hope of bringing about the trends we are finally seeing. Covid cases and hospitalizations are falling, and according to the White House, a majority of elderly Americans have received at least one shot of the several vaccines that are now available. Nursing-home deaths have dropped to levels not seen since spring 2020. Businesses are reopening. Grandparents are hugging their grandchildren again. The pandemic isn't over, but people correctly sense the danger is declining. They want more of their regular lives back. </p><p>   Federal, state and local officials need to develop public-health guidance that smooths the way back to normal. We can't lean too far forward, risking a fourth wave of hospitalizations and deaths. But we also can't lean too far in the other direction, with overly restrictive measures that people will ignore. Effective leadership means finding a middle path. </p><p>   As more people get vaccinated, especially older Americans, the vulnerability of the population falls. The Biden administration reports more than 20% of adults have had at least one shot, including 56% of those over 65. Measuring the risk from Covid is no longer primarily about tallying daily cases or analyzing the positivity rate. As the most vulnerable Americans are increasingly being protected by vaccines, it's also about assessing the number of people developing severe disease. </p><p>   Even as the pandemic retreats, we won't eliminate all Covid infections, but we can make sure that major surges in hospitalizations and deaths don't recur. One key indicator to track is whether stress on the healthcare system remains low. For a full year, officials have been trying to ensure that hospital use doesn't reach crisis levels. Now, the goal should be for hospitalization rates to resemble those associated with routine infectious diseases. Combined with better control of seasonal flu which burdens hospitals each winter, Covid transmission can be suppressed to manageable levels. </p><p>   Stepping up vaccinations is the most critical step. Supply is increasing, and the pace of vaccination needs to increase as well. Last week, for the first time, there were days when the number of second shots delivered approximated the number of first shots, so we still have room to expand distribution. We need to broaden access way beyond mass vaccination sites and make it easier for people -- especially harder-to-reach communities and groups -- to get questions answered by clinicians they trust. Allowing those who have received the vaccine the flexibility to engage in a greater range of activities could provide an additional incentive for getting vaccinated. </p><p>   Better viral surveillance is also necessary to get out in front of any possible surge in serious cases. People with symptoms need easy access to diagnostic tests. Those who do become sick need therapies like antibody drugs to reduce the chances of becoming seriously ill. Surveillance should also include routine evaluation of the genetic sequences of different strains that are collected, to quickly identify new variants, and determine if they pose increased danger. </p><p>   More people getting vaccinated likely means an increase in the share of infections showing no or minimal symptoms. So \"tracking and tracing\" symptomatic people to identify and mitigate spread won't be enough. Communities, workplaces, and other settings at greater risk of outbreaks, and those where outbreaks are detected, will need access to reliable screening tests to prevent new epidemics. </p><p>   Health officials have asked Americans to make enormous sacrifices, and the country has pulled together to contain the Covid threat. People mostly wore masks, small businesses bore a massive burden, and essential workers took great risks. Sure, there was grumbling, and, in some places, protests against certain measures. Not everyone took the advice of the public-health experts. But for all the coverage of things that didn't work, there have been valiant efforts everywhere to keep each other safe. </p><p>   The path to normalcy won't be linear. As summer approaches, things will likely loosen up, but we may need to reinstate stricter precautions in the fall or winter. Not everyone will choose to get vaccinated, and new variants may leave more of us vulnerable. The good news is that the risks from Covid continue to decline, and the right steps now can limit the risk of future Covid disruptions and let us reclaim the things we value. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Dr. Gottlieb is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and was commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, 2017-19.
