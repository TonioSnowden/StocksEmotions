  "title": "Flu, RSV and Covid Drive Demand for Children's Pain Relievers and Fever Reducers; The 'tripledemic' is fueling sales and causing drugstores to limit purchases of over-the-counter medicine",
  "text": "<p>announced they have imposed purchase limits on children's cold and flu medicines. Sales of children's over-the-counter medication are up 80% compared with the same four-week period a year earlier, totaling more than $86 million, according to market-research firm IRI. Inflation has also contributed to higher dollar sales, but it is mainly rising demand that is causing the shortages, IRI said. Parents and caregivers also have fewer pediatric pain relievers to choose from, with the number of options down 7% compared with a year ago.</p><p>Manufacturers are producing at full capacity and directing inventory to where it is most needed, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents producers of over-the-counter medications. \"However, we understand it might be frustrating for parents to quickly locate these products from their usual pharmacy or retailer due to intermittent out-of-stocks,\" the group said. A spokeswoman for Johnson &amp; Johnson, whose brands include pain relievers Tylenol and Motrin, said that while some products might be less readily available, the company isn't experiencing widespread shortages of children's Tylenol or Motrin.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Have you noticed a shortage of pediatric OTC medications in your neighborhood? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Demand for cough and cold medicines typically increases as the weather cools and holidays arrive, when people spend more time indoors and gather with friends and family. Hospitalizations for flu continue to be at the highest point in this part of the influenza season in over a decade, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This year, doctors and hospitals have reported high numbers of RSV cases, especially among children and infants.</p><p>With all three illnesses surging at once, especially among children, it has been more difficult for suppliers to keep up with consumer demand. Since there is no medication treatment option for small children with RSV or Covid-19, pediatricians mainly recommend giving over-the-counter pain relievers.</p><p>While influenza can be detected year round, cases typically peak between December and February. However, the start of the flu season has become less predictable since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the CDC. The pandemic also caused 2020 to see \"uncharacteristically low\" levels of flu cases.</p><p>A spokesman for Walgreens said it is limiting online purchases of children's fever reducers to six per transaction. The company says it is joining with new suppliers and distributors. CVS is only allowing customers to purchase two products per transaction in stores and online while working to ensure continued access, according to a spokesman.</p><p>According to IRI, demand is up to varying degrees—for both adult and children's cold and flu medications and pain relievers—compared with the past three years.</p><p>\"In the most recent 12 weeks, cough, cold, flu and sinus medication sales outpaced prepandemic levels by nearly $200 million,\" said Krishnakumar Davey, president of client engagement at IRI.</p><p>Canada has also been experiencing similar shortages. In November, government officials issued emergency orders allowing for acetaminophen and ibuprofen to be imported from the U.S. and Australia. In both Canada and the U.S., the medication shortage has exacerbated an overextended hospital system.</p><p>—Sharon Terlep contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Stephanie Stamm at stephanie.stamm@wsj.com</p><p>Flu, RSV and Covid Drive Demand for Children's Pain Relievers and Fever Reducers</p>",
