  "title": "Novavax Covid-19 Vaccine Faces FDA Advisers' Scrutiny; Outside panel to recommend whether the shot should be authorized, after the agency found it effective but flagged a heart-safety concern",
  "text": "<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would then decide whether to recommend the vaccine's use, before the shots would become widely available.</p><p>Novavax says the shot would appeal to people reluctant to receive the vaccines made by either Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE or by Moderna Inc., which are each based on the relatively new gene-based technology known as messenger RNA.</p><p>Overall, however, the use of Covid-19 vaccines and boosters has slowed in the U.S., as many people eligible for the shots have received them and tire of getting additional doses. Roughly 67% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, according to the CDC. Less than half the population has received one booster.</p><p>During their all-day meeting, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is scheduled to consider clinical trial data from the company as well as the FDA staff's review.</p><p>The FDA said the vaccine was 90%-effective against Covid-19 in its pivotal trial, but the study took place before the emergence of the Omicron variant that has been better able to elude other vaccines.</p><p>The agency also flagged six \"concerning\" cases of heart-inflammation conditions known as myocarditis and pericarditis found among 40,000 shot recipients across multiple trials.</p><p>Novavax, of Gaithersburg, Md., said there isn't enough evidence that the heart-inflammation cases were caused by its shots and that the conditions appear normally in any large group of people.</p><p>The company's Covid-19 vaccine would be the first authorized in the U.S. with a traditional protein-based platform, used for decades to inoculate against diseases such as hepatitis B and shingles.</p><p>It sends a version of the coronavirus spike protein to stimulate the body's immune response. That is different from the market-dominating Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, which deliver mRNA to instruct the body to assemble a harmless version of the coronavirus spike protein, which then triggers the immune system to mobilize defenses.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine uses a modified version of an adenovirus, the virus behind many common colds, to deliver genetic instructions to cells.</p><p>Novavax has said it regularly gets calls and emails from people awaiting its vaccine, and some experts have voiced hope that the shot could win over unvaccinated skeptics of mRNA technology.</p><p>Kayb Joseph, a 47-year-old Chattanooga, Tenn., resident, said she has checked every two weeks for news on Novavax's vaccine and would drive to the company's Maryland headquarters to get it if needed. She prefers its protein-based platform.</p><p>\"I just don't believe in being somebody's R&amp;D,\" she said. \"Novavax is still just the first version, but to me it is the second version of traditional technology.\"</p><p>Write to Liz Essley Whyte at liz.whyte@wsj.com</p><p>Novavax Covid-19 Vaccine Faces FDA Advisers' Scrutiny</p>",
