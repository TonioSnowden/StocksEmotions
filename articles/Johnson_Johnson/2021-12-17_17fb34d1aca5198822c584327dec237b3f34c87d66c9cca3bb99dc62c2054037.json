  "title": "U.S. News: CDC Backs Pfizer, Moderna Vaccines Over J&J's",
  "text": "<p>The agency noted similar recommendations have been made in other countries, including Canada and the U.K. People unable or unwilling to receive a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, the CDC said, will continue to have access to the J&amp;J vaccine.</p><p>The updated position is likely to deal another blow to the use of the J&amp;J shot, whose uptake had been hurt by manufacturing issues and earlier reports of J&amp;J vaccine recipients, especially women, experiencing blood clots combined with low blood-platelet levels.</p><p>There have been at least 54 cases of the condition, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS, among J&amp;J vaccine recipients in the U.S., including nine resulting in deaths, CDC officials said Thursday.</p><p>The rate of cases is higher than previously estimated in men and women, and in a wider age range, the officials said.</p><p>\"I just cannot recommend vaccines associated with a condition that may lead to death,\" said Pablo Sanchez, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at the Ohio State University-Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio., who serves on the panel of CDC advisers.</p><p>J&amp;J said it remained confident in the overall positive benefit-risk profile of its vaccine. \"The safety and well-being of those who use the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine continues to be our No. 1 priority,\" said Mathai Mammen, global head of J&amp;J's pharmaceutical research and development.</p><p>He said the company will work with the CDC on next steps and strongly supports education about rare events such as TTS and how to manage it.</p><p>J&amp;J's Covid-19 vaccine is based on a different technology than the messenger RNA used in the Pfizer and Moderna shots.</p><p>J&amp;J's vaccine includes a harmless version of a virus that can cause the common cold, which is engineered to contain genetic instructions that set off an immune response. The mRNA vaccines don't contain any viral material and use a different way of delivering a genetic code that sets off an immune response.</p><p>As of Aug. 31, CDC officials said at the advisers' meeting, about 3.8 cases of TTS were reported for every million doses of J&amp;J vaccine administered, across all recipients. The rate was highest among women ages 30 to 39, at 10.6 per million doses.</p><p>CDC officials also said that among those who develop TTS, the fatality rate was about 15%. The people who died deteriorated quickly after being admitted to the hospital. CDC officials said getting J&amp;J's vaccine was still superior to not getting vaccinated, but the balance between the benefits and risks for the messenger RNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna was superior to J&amp;J's. And the current supply of mRNA vaccines in the U.S. is adequate, unlike earlier in the year.</p><p>Health officials say people with an allergy to ingredients in the mRNA vaccines, or who have had a severe allergic reaction to a dose of those vaccines, shouldn't receive them.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
