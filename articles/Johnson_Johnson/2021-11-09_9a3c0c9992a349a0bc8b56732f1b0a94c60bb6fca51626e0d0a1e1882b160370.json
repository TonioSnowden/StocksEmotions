  "title": "Companies Lobby Against Democrats' Interest-Deduction Limits; Executives say corporate debt, investment could shift offshore if proposal raises U.S. borrowing costs for multinational companies",
  "text": "<p>On Oct. 30, more than three dozen large companies wrote congressional leaders asking them to drop the proposed limits. The companies included Anheuser-Busch InBev SA, Corning Inc., Dell Technologies Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson, United Parcel Service Inc. and T-Mobile U.S. Inc. The letter called the proposal \"debilitating to a broad range of industries and sectors,\" and added, \"This will result in reduced U.S. job creation and investment while encouraging offshore jobs creation.\"</p><p>The proposal aims to close loopholes \"that big corporations exploit to avoid taxes by strategically sticking debt in the United States, when they are already operating and earning income offshore,\" a spokeswoman for Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) said. \"If they are actually investing and earning their income in the United States, this will not affect them.\"</p><p>The measure would further tighten limits imposed by the 2017 tax overhaul—setting up the U.S. to have stricter limits than many other countries, said Michelle Hanlon, an accounting professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management who has written a book on taxes and business strategy. \"It's harsher than the rest of the world,\" she said.</p><p>The proposed interest-deduction limits would raise $28 billion over 10 years, the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last week.</p><p>\"I don't think this provision would reduce capital raising in the U.S.,\" said Remmelt Reigersman, a partner in tax transaction and consulting practice at law firm Mayer Brown. Companies would lend more of their U.S. debt proceeds to foreign subsidiaries, removing interest on that debt from the proposed limit but otherwise not hurting the company. \"It will be the allocations within the group that will be rejiggered,\" he said.</p><p>The new limits would affect multinational companies that average at least $12 million a year over three years in net interest expense, meaning interest payments exceeding interest income, legislative documents and summaries show. Those companies would have to calculate how much of their global earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization—or Ebitda—is generated in the U.S.; they could then deduct at most roughly the same percentage of their global interest expense.</p><p>More than 80% of S&amp;P 500 companies met the net interest-expense threshold over their three most recent fiscal years, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. They include Walmart Inc., averaging $2.2 billion; AbbVie Inc. at $1.6 billion; and Broadcom Inc. at $1.2 billion.</p><p>Some large companies, such as Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc., incur little interest expense or earn enough interest income to keep net interest expense under the $12 million threshold.</p><p>Companies with primarily U.S. profits might be able to avoid the limit as well. Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. doesn't expect the provision to be onerous unless the legislation changes substantially, finance chief Ozan Dokmecioglu said. \"Given that 90% of our revenue is U.S. based, we expect that our exposure...to proposed interest-deduction limitations will be limited,\" he said.</p><p>U.S. companies so far have sold $1.28 trillion in debt this year, including $1.15 trillion—or 90% of the total—in the U.S., according to Refinitiv, a financial data provider.</p><p>That compares with $1.72 trillion, or 93% of the total raised in the U.S. in all of last year and $994.05 billion, or 85% of the total raised in the U.S. in all of 2019, Refinitiv said.</p><p>Finance executives and tax professionals say big multinational companies typically borrow most in their home country because that is where debt is cheapest for them. Parent companies tend to have higher credit ratings and are seen as less risky, in part because creditors would potentially have access to the entire company's assets in bankruptcy. Supporters of the provision argue that borrowing and interest are mobile and that companies have an incentive to try to shift them to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, to win a bigger deduction.</p><p>Lenders often view providing a loan to a foreign subsidiary as riskier than to the parent, said Pat Brown, co-leader of PricewaterhouseCoopers' national tax office.</p><p>The 2017 GOP tax overhaul let companies deduct no more than 30% of Ebitda in any given year, declining next year to 30% of earnings before interest and taxes. If the new rule is adopted, companies would be limited to deducting the lesser of the amount under the 2017 rule and the new rule, though they could carry disallowed deductions forward to future years.</p><p>Together, the rules are more stringent than those imposed by other countries, which typically let companies take the better of a fixed calculation, like the U.S.'s 30% of Ebitda, and a company-specific calculation, like the newly proposed limit, Prof. Hanlon said.</p><p>If the new rule raises borrowing costs for companies, they have incentives to raise capital and move investment outside the U.S., tax professionals say. Company finance executives say they are already considering the possibility of borrowing more outside the U.S.</p><p>For a company like Carrier Global Corp, \"we would have to look at, of course, having some debt outside of the U.S.,\" said Patrick Goris, finance chief of the manufacturer of heating and air-conditioning equipment that signed the letter to congressional leaders. Carrier has been exploring potential strategies to avoid the penalty associated with the proposal, he said, \"because in the big scheme of things, debt financing remains very attractive in today's environment.\"</p><p>Richard Rubin contributed to this article.</p><p>More on Business Policy</p><p>Coverage of the latest actions in Congress affecting U.S. companies, selected by WSJ editors:</p><p>* Infrastructure Projects to Boost Sales and Prices, Industry Executives Say (Nov. 8)</p><p>* Biden Gets $1 Trillion Down Payment on Agenda as Obstacles Loom for Spending Bill (Nov. 7)</p><p>* Democrats Weigh Taxes on Companies, Millionaires to Pay for Domestic Programs (Oct. 28)</p><p>* Who Could Pay More With a 15% Corporate Minimum Tax?
