  "title": "FDA Clears Booster  In Limited Cases  ----  By Felicia Schwartz and Stephanie Armour",
  "text": "<p>   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized booster shots for certain people with weakened immune systems, likely the launch of broader efforts to better protect against evasive variants like Delta. </p><p>   The agency on Thursday cleared giving a third dose of a messenger RNA Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and its partner BioNTech SE or from Moderna Inc. to immunocompromised people who had received a solid organ transplant or individuals who have been diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise. </p><p>   \"After a thorough review of the available data, the FDA determined that this small, vulnerable group may benefit from a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna Vaccines,\" Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement. </p><p>   She said other people who are fully vaccinated are adequately protected and don't need an additional dose at this time. The agency is reviewing whether an additional dose may be needed in the future, she said. </p><p>   The decision expanding the authorization of the mRNA shots follows evidence that vaccines are less effective at protecting people with weakened immune systems from Covid-19 than the general population. </p><p>   Immunocompromised people who didn't have an antibody response after two doses of the mRNA vaccines had responses after a third dose, studies indicated, supporting the decision to recommend a third dose. </p><p>   Some immunocompromised people, which include transplant recipients and certain cancer patients, have sought to get a third dose on their own. </p><p>   \"This action is about ensuring our most vulnerable, who may need an additional dose to enhance their biological responses to the vaccines, are better protected against Covid-19,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said. </p><p>   \"An additional dose could help increase protection for these individuals, which is especially important as the Delta variant spreads,\" she added. </p><p>   The expanded authorization is expected to be the first step in a broader campaign to get ahead of the evolving coronavirus, which has mutated into more contagious strains. </p><p>   The virus's evolution threatens to undermine attempts to move past the pandemic, not long after it appeared that vaccinations held the key to discarding many of the most onerous public-health measures. </p><p>   Health authorities blame the Delta variant, in particular, for the surging cases across the U.S., especially among people who aren't vaccinated, which have swamped hospital emergency rooms in areas with low vaccination rates. </p><p>   The surge has prompted many authorities to revive masking recommendations and some businesses to dial back efforts at returning workers to offices. </p><p>   Authorized vaccines appear to work well against the new strains that have emerged so far, especially protecting people against severe Covid-19, according to studies. </p><p>   Yet the shots don't appear to be quite as effective as they were against the original virus, many studies indicate. Some other, preliminary research suggests that the protection conferred by vaccination wanes over time. </p><p>   To maintain high levels of protection, some public-health experts and vaccine makers have recommended giving boosters to the general public. </p><p>   The Biden administration is expected to decide on a broader booster strategy by September. </p><p>   Other countries, including Israel, have authorized extra doses for those with weakened immune systems. The World Health Organization has asked countries to hold off on giving boosters to help other nations with few doses gain access. </p><p>   About 2.7% of American adults are immunocompromised, which also includes people who live with HIV or take cancer treatments and other drugs that suppress their immune systems. </p><p>   Their weakened immune systems make them especially vulnerable to the coronavirus. </p><p>   Research suggests immunocompromised people are more likely to get severely ill from Covid-19, are more likely to transmit it to household contacts and more likely to have breakthrough infections. </p><p>   Their weakened immune systems also make the people less responsive to vaccines, which require stimulation of the immune system to provide protection. An extra dose can help mobilize their immune defenses, according to researchers, increasing protection levels. </p><p>   Pfizer has said it plans to ask U.S. regulators to authorize booster shots of its two-dose Covid-19 vaccine this month. Moderna has said it plans to do so next month. </p><p>   Johnson &amp; Johnson is expected to release data about the efficacy of two doses of its single-shot vaccine later this month. </p><p>   About half of the U.S., or 167.1 million people, are fully vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p>   The FDA said the immunocompromised who get an extra vaccine dose should still take precautions to avoid infection. </p><p></p>",
