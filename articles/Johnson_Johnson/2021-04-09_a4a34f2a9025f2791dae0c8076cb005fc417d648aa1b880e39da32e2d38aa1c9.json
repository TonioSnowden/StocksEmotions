The company has already gone through a series of refinancing deals and reported a €3.2bn loss in the year to the end of September.</p> <p>Governments around the world meanwhile are striving to inject hope into the airline industry. In the UK, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c30869ea-fa55-401d-b04c-311c64235597\">government proposals</a> to allow travel to certain countries from May 17 were criticised for the caveat that travellers must undergo costly PCR Covid tests. The plans follow another week of uncertainty for a sector that lost $118.5bn in 2020, the worst year in aviation history, with downgraded passenger forecasts from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e86dc325-2e65-4097-bd51-adb16e0f3ef3\">Ryanair</a> and new state aid for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/054705d4-30da-4cd5-a071-f1dfde366fa2\">Air France/KLM</a>.</p> <p>A handful of entrepreneurs such as Nino Singh Judge, a former motorsport businessman who calls himself the “Sikh Michael O'Leary” have found inspiration amid the chaos, founding <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc4920df-f603-4a88-b8fe-d04bb93d8838\">new airlines</a> that can react quickly to new conditions rather than trying to adapt business models designed for very different times. The new carriers are targeting segments such as the VFR (visiting friends and relatives) market with slogans such as “fewer, smarter flights”. They also have plenty of resources to tap into: experienced crew and some 6,000 aircraft around the world are currently parked up doing nothing. </p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddd8ec03-450c-4a14-b1e2-e3afe1f44c7b#post-8fb5f348-c888-47b3-9c6c-da22c842508d\">Factory prices</a> in <strong>China</strong> increased 4.4 per cent in March, the fastest rate since 2018, raising the possibility of rate rises and a tightening of economic policy. Consumer prices, which have turned negative in recent months, rose 0.4 per cent. </p> <p>Industry confidence in a bounceback for global trade was reflected in a record month for <strong>container ship</strong> orders, buoying hard-hit shipbuilders in Asia. Liners signed deals for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77989ec9-e674-4c75-814b-9b7451722ac6\">72 vessels</a> with a total capacity of about 866,000 20-ft containers, most of a similar size to the ship recently stuck in the Suez Canal for six days. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/060334ce-b1ee-4bb8-bb5c-5bd1fb3d63d0\">European Central Bank</a> is worried that the slow rollout of <strong>vaccines</strong> in the eurozone could harm economic recovery. Tensions over <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a816a6cd-030d-4258-9a48-23bc8ca75b7e\">supplies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c85fad0-401e-43ea-842a-846c94d75663\">export restrictions</a> continue to dog the bloc. </p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>The FT revealed that <strong>AstraZeneca</strong> slashed the number of Covid-19 vaccines it will deliver to the EU this week by almost half as the company struggles with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df5020f4-461e-443e-8d55-f3234690d049\">production problems</a>. The drugmaker now expects to deliver 1.3m doses to member states, plus Iceland and Norway, down from its mid-March forecast of 2.6m</p> <p>Finance directors are hoping to save billions in <strong>office costs</strong> with the rise of homeworking. The Lex column says <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cac0cc37-ffa1-4d38-8f51-e52c331e3462\">space requirements</a> could drop by up to 20 per cent, equivalent to 226m square feet in the UK, or a saving of £60bn. UK ministers are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1051900-374e-476d-bd3b-b7770559e75b\">consulting business</a> on the best way to implement <strong>social distancing</strong> in the workplace. <br><br>Hot, sweaty and crammed with hundreds of strangers: <strong>nightclubs</strong> have little to recommend to infectious disease experts, writes leisure industries reporter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/20faa49c-4723-4eea-b167-7160391196ab\">Alice Hancock</a>. The UK's night-time entertainment and hospitality industry, including theatres, bars, restaurants and clubs, generates at least £66bn a year — about as much as the country's airline industry — but can venues be made safe?</p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p>Confidence in a strong <strong>economic recovery</strong> and a calm in bond markets are driving <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae6a6eb5-0a02-4d68-9a68-63dede1fd5ae\">European and US stocks</a> towards a record week. By contrast, markets in China tumbled on fears of greater price pressures. </p> <p>Optimism for a strong US bounceback has given the <strong>dollar</strong> a real lift in the first few months of this year. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ed6e64b-d253-4886-b7b9-fe428acad728\">dollar index</a>, which measures performance against other major currencies, is up 3.6 per cent in the first quarter, its best run since 2018.</p> <p>After a year of pandemic-induced market gyrations, and despite talk of a green recovery, the US is focusing again on its traditional pursuit of <strong>cheap oil</strong> from abroad, writes US energy editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53580ff1-670b-43ba-b7a6-b7bccc6c191f\">Derek Brower</a>. Although still a bargain compared with Europe, pump prices for Americans have risen 45 per cent in the past 12 months.</p> <h2>The Essentials</h2> <p>How are <strong>vaccination programmes</strong> across the world faring? Science editor Clive Cookson and pharma correspondent Hannah Kuchler answered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f97b04a-e16d-4d59-8371-630e70ea360e\">readers' questions</a> today.</p> <p>Fed up balancing that laptop on the edge of the kitchen table?<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b7bf370-8c7f-47aa-b456-075a368ffda6\"> Jonathan Margolis</a> has some smart <strong>standing desk</strong> solutions. </p> <h2>Have your say</h2> <p>Reader asdfasdf comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cac0cc37-ffa1-4d38-8f51-e52c331e3462?commentID=fa4d110d-046c-46f1-8607-b6881cc006a6\">Offices: homeworking will save employers billions</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>The cost of office space will not be eliminated, simply passed on to employees who are forced to upsize their homes to avoid working from the kitchen table. It's all in line with the gig-ification of the economy where companies save costs by forcing employees to bear the costs of doing business (See: Deliveroo workers paying for their own bikes).</p> </blockquote> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p>A moderniser who became more traditional, a man once dubbed “HRH Victor Meldrew”, after the famously grumpy UK television character, came to be seen as a national treasure. More than six decades' service at those two paces behind the Queen had earned him that, writes Brian Groom in his obituary of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53794ffd-428b-4fed-a55a-7daf54cdc047\">Prince Philip</a>, Duke of Edinburgh, whose death was announced earlier today. </p> <p><em>We would really like to hear from you.
