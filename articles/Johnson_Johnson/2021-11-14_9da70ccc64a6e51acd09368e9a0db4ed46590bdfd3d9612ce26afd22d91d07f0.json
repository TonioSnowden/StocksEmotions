Join the conversation below.</p><p>The stalled progress is an unwelcome turn as the Thanksgiving holiday nears, which will mean more people traveling and congregating indoors, as families gather to celebrate.</p><p>\"Right now we find ourselves in a really truly alarming spike in cases,\" Jan Malcolm, commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Health, said at a briefing last week.</p><p>Minnesota has recently averaged more than 3,500 new cases a day, according to Johns Hopkins, the state's highest level since last April. After a brief summertime lull, when the state reported only about two new Covid-19 deaths a day, the seven-day average is about 24 a day. The state recently topped 9,000 deaths since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins.</p><p>The latest surge has begun overwhelming some hospitals. Gov. Tim Walz set up two temporary sites staffed by National Guard members and federal nurses to relieve hospitals caring for Covid patients.</p><p>States widely report the bulk of Covid-19 hospitalizations remain among unvaccinated or partially vaccinated patients, even as some states show fully vaccinated people have become a rising share of the mix.</p><p>The virus is spreading in other cold-weather places like Michigan and New England, including Vermont. Cases also are heating up in some Southwestern states like Arizona, which has recently averaged more than 3,000 new cases a day.</p><p>\"After nearly two years, I don't blame anyone for feeling done with the Covid-19 pandemic,\" Don Herrington, interim director of the Arizona Department of Health Services, wrote in a blog post last week. \"The unfortunate truth, however, is the pandemic isn't done with us.\"</p><p>The problem is mainly the still-unvaccinated population in the U.S., and waning immunity among people who got vaccine shots early on and now should get boosters, said Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, Calif.</p><p>Roughly 59% of the whole U.S. population is fully vaccinated, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning they have received two doses of an mRNA vaccine or the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson shot. And about one-third of people aged 65 and up have had a booster shot, CDC data show.</p><p>\"We still have a huge number of people unvaccinated,\" Dr. Topol said. \"That's by far the driving factor.\"</p><p>The Delta-fueled surge that began over the summer appeared to peak in early September, when the nation averaged more than 160,000 new cases a day. The cool-off in the South helped relieve some pressure, likely due in part to the surge in infections also building up more immunity in the population, health experts say.</p><p>The price was heavy. The U.S. reported more than 150,000 Covid-19 deaths over the past four months, bringing the pandemic total of known Covid-19 deaths to more than 760,000.</p><p>The decline in new daily cases stalled in late October, when the U.S. average fell to near the 70,000 mark, Johns Hopkins data show; by Friday that average was closer to 80,000. In June, the average had briefly slipped below 12,000 new daily cases.</p><p>Meanwhile, the recent decline in new hospital admissions has also halted as numbers start rising again, federal data show. And the U.S. continues to average more than 1,000 newly reported Covid-19 deaths a day, Johns Hopkins data show.</p><p>Health authorities say the Delta variant is easily finding pockets of still-unvaccinated people, even in some of the most-vaccinated places, like Vermont, where about 72% of the population is fully inoculated.</p><p>\"The high number of cases continues to be dominated by those who are unvaccinated,\" Vermont Gov. Phil Scott said last week.</p><p>Mr. Scott said the surge is putting pressure on hospitals that are already under strain from patients seeking care for other reasons, including catching up on delayed care from earlier in the pandemic. Elsewhere in the region, Maine, which has been battling a persistent Delta-fueled surge, reported a record 248 Covid-19 patients in hospitals on Friday.</p><p>Some states, like Michigan, report that fully vaccinated people are increasingly adding to their Covid-19 numbersâ€”reflecting both the rising number of vaccinated people and the vaccines' waning effectiveness among people who got the shots early on. The numbers highlight the need for boosters, public-health experts say.</p><p>\"As the fully vaccinated population has increased, so have the percent of breakthrough incidents; but breakthrough burden remains lower,\" a recent Michigan report said.</p><p>Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, chief medical executive in the state, said the rise in cases among 5- to 18-year-olds, particularly at schools that reopened this fall without masking protocols in place, has been a major contributor to the state's overall surge. The recent rollout of vaccine shots for children ages 5 to 11 could help.</p><p>\"What I am fearful of is that colder weather is coming,\" Dr. Bagdasarian said. \"People are gathering more indoors. The holidays are coming. And on top of that we have viral respiratory season right around the corner.\"</p><p>Tracking Covid-19 Vaccine Distribution</p><p>Write to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.com and Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.com</p><p>Covid-19 Cases Rise in Pockets of North and West, Halting Delta Variant's Decline in U.S.</p>",
