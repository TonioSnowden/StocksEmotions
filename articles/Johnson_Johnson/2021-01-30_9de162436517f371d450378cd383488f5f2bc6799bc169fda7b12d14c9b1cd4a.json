  "title": "U.S. News:  New Vaccine: How  It Works, Differs  ----  By Peter Loftus",
  "text": "<p>\n  Johnson &amp; Johnson reported that its single-dose Covid-19 vaccine protected against Covid-19 in a late-stage trial, while being generally safe and well tolerated. Here's what is known and not known: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  How effective is J&amp;J's vaccine? </p><p>\n  The vaccine was 66% effective in a late-stage study with about 44,000 volunteers ages 18 years and older, according to the company. That indicates the shot protects adults from moderate to severe Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. When focusing on preventing severe disease specifically, the vaccine was more effective, posting an 85% rate. By comparison, an annual flu shot is considered is 60% effective. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  How does it compare with the effectiveness of Pfizer and Moderna shots? </p><p>\n  The vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE was 95% effective at preventing people from getting sick with Covid-19 in its late-stage study, while the Moderna Inc. vaccine was 94.1% effective. It can be tricky to compare across trials, however. And the timing of the testing might have played a role, as J&amp;J's took place while new coronavirus variants emerged. Vaccines don't appear to work as well against the variant first identified in South Africa, in particular. J&amp;J's vaccine was 57% effective in South Africa compared with 72% in the U.S. during the late-stage trial. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  When might the J&amp;J vaccine become available? </p><p>\n  J&amp;J says it expects in early February to ask the Food and Drug Administration to authorize the use of its vaccine. If the FDA takes the same amount of time as it did to review and authorize the first two Covid-19 vaccines -- about three weeks -- it could make a decision later in February or by early March. J&amp;J has been making doses while testing its shot, so it could be ready to ship supplies quickly after getting a go-ahead from regulators. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  What are the side effects of J&amp;J's vaccine? </p><p>\n  The most common symptoms after vaccination were fatigue, headache, muscle ache and injection-site pain in an early-stage study. In the late-stage study, J&amp;J said a small percentage of subjects had fever, and there were no severe allergic reactions. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Which vaccine should you get? </p><p>\n  The first one you can, health authorities say. It is possible that individuals won't have much of a choice because of limited supplies, and the vaccination site might offer only one of the shots. If you do have a choice, there are some key differences that could guide your decision. J&amp;J's vaccine, while appearing less effective in studies, is given as a single dose, which may be a more convenient option than the two doses required for both of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, given three or four weeks apart. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  How does J&amp;J's vaccine work? </p><p>\n  The vaccine uses a harmless type of virus, called an adenovirus, which can cause cold symptoms. It is modified to contain the DNA of the so-called spike protein found on the surface of the new coronavirus. Once injected, the adenovirus carries the DNA payload into human cells. Once inside the cells, the DNA payload causes the production of the spike protein. This, in turn, triggers an immune response that can later defend against the real coronavirus if a vaccinated person is exposed to it. </p><p></p>",
