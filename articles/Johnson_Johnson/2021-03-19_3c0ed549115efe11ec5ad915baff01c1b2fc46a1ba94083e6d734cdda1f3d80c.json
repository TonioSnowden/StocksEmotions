  "title": "East is East: India Beats China at Vaccine Diplomacy",
  "text": "<p>India takes vaccine diplomacy equally seriously. In Parliament on Wednesday, Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar declared that the country's \"Vaccine Friendship\" program has \"raised India's standing and generated great international goodwill.\"</p><p>Donating or exporting medical supplies allows Beijing and New Delhi to burnish their soft power, showcase their technological prowess, give their firms footholds in new markets, and boast to their domestic audiences that they are major players on the world stage. With Western nations preoccupied with inoculating their own populations, the Asian giants are jostling to make the most of the opportunity.</p><p>The leaders of Sri Lanka and Dominica personally received shipments of Indian-made vaccines at the airport, and the Mongolian prime minister took an Indian-made shot. Chinese vaccines have inoculated Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Indonesia's Joko Widodo and the president of Seychelles. In Europe, Chinese vaccines have established a foothold in Serbia, Hungary, North Macedonia and Montenegro.</p><p>India's massive pharmaceutical industry accounts for about 20% of the world's generic medicines and more than 60% of all global vaccine production. A Foreign Ministry website lists 72 countries that have received about 60 million doses of Indian-made Covid vaccines. A private firm, Serum Institute of India, along with the Anglo-Swedish firm AstraZeneca and Maryland-headquartered Novavax, has pledged 1.1 billion doses to Covax, the World Health Organization-led effort to supply vaccines to the world's poorest countries.</p><p>According to official statistics, widely disputed by experts, Beijing has done a much better job than New Delhi of containing the pandemic at home: Only about 5,000 Chinese nationals have died, compared with about 160,000 Indians. Independently verified figures are hard to come by, but the Chinese lead in vaccine diplomacy is much narrower -- if it's a lead at all. According to a recent essay in Foreign Affairs by Yanzhong Huang, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, so far Chinese firms have received orders for roughly 572 million doses and promised another 10 million to Covax. The Chinese Foreign Ministry says it plans to provide free vaccines to 69 countries and sell them to another 28 countries.</p><p>Last week New Delhi's partners in the Quad -- a loose grouping of the U.S., Japan, Australia and India -- stepped in to turbocharge India's efforts. At a virtual summit, the first involving the leaders of all four countries, the Quad pledged to supply at least one billion doses of vaccines, including one developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson, to Indo-Pacific nations by the end of next year. The U.S., Japan and Australia will fund the production and delivery of the vaccines by a private Indian firm, Biological E. Australia will use its regional logistics expertise to deliver them.</p><p>Pooling their strengths makes sense for Quad countries, and the vaccine initiative ought to quiet critics who view the group as little more than a talk shop. The focus on Southeast Asia pushes back directly against Beijing's efforts to dominate the region. But both the new initiative and the success of New Delhi's vaccine diplomacy offer a broader lesson for India. It is much more likely to achieve its objectives by collaborating closely with Western democracies than by embarking upon a quixotic quest for \"self-reliance.\"</p><p>Against a backdrop of rising nationalism, the Modi government has portrayed its vaccine effort as part of a successful quest to create a \"self-reliant India.\" It rushed through emergency approval of a domestic vaccine developed by an Indian drugmaker, Bharat Biotech, despite its not yet having completed phase 3 trials at the time. On March 1, a nurse administered the still unproven Indian vaccine to Mr. Modi.</p><p>In reality, India's vaccine prowess comes from collaboration, not self-reliance. Take Serum Institute, the firm that gives India much of its Covid-vaccine muscle by pumping out 2.5 million doses a day of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and by collaborating with other Western firms, including Novovax. The \"Made in India\" vaccine Indian diplomats tout was developed by AstraZeneca in collaboration with Oxford University and with financial assistance from the U.S. Serum Institute took a risk by commencing manufacture of the AstraZeneca vaccine before it was clear that it would be approved by the WHO, the U.K. or India. (U.S. regulators are yet to approve it.) But that risk was underwritten in part by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which promised to offset potential losses.</p><p>So far, the AstraZeneca vaccine has been approved by the WHO and widely welcomed in many countries. China's vaccines, panned by critics for poor data transparency and, in some cases, a low efficacy rate, lack this international imprimatur. If Indian-made Covid vaccines are welcomed around the world, it's in part because they are backed by the transparency and rigor of Western medicine. Often funding by Western NGOs adds to their attractiveness.</p><p>There's nothing wrong with India's ambition to develop homegrown vaccines. But as the country's own experience shows, India does best when it's open and collaborative -- and takes a little help from its Western friends.</p>",
