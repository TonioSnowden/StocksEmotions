The regulatory relief had helped lenders cope with a surge in deposits that resulted from US fiscal stimulus and the central bank's quantitative easing policies.</p> <p>Usually, deposit growth is a welcome indicator of a healthy economy and allows banks to lend more. But in the absence of comparable loan demand, extra deposits can be costly for banks, requiring them to hold more capital.</p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Dr Anthony Fauci</strong>, the chief medical adviser to Joe Biden, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f41b122-5738-4707-a822-0d79276710c5\">told the Financial Times</a> that he would oppose a plan to rip up international trade rules in the hope of improving vaccine supply to developing countries.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>New York</strong>, <strong>New Jersey</strong> and <strong>Connecticut</strong> will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04d7b81a-51ba-427d-9dd1-ecffa5559608\">lift most restrictions</a> on businesses by mid-May.

Saudi Aramco like other listed oil majors has benefited largely from a pick-up in oil prices as demand recovers. </p> <p><strong>Chinese banks accused of funding deforestation</strong> Chinese banks are the second largest financers of commodities implicated in tropical rainforest deforestation, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/887e640b-8d0a-4c0b-86e4-62176d27d29d\">according to research</a> that casts doubt on Beijing's ambitions to be a global leader in the fight against climate change.</p> <p><strong>Senior Fed official in line to lead top US banking regulator</strong> Michael Hsu, a senior Federal Reserve official responsible for supervising the largest US banks, is poised to become <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/808d246c-f6b5-42f5-af5e-b2005c49ee9b\">the next acting comptroller of the currency</a>, ending weeks of uncertainty over the US financial regulator's leadership.</p> <p><strong>US plans crackdown on greenhouse gases used in refrigerators</strong> The US Environmental Protection Agency has announced <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3dbaba59-69ab-4694-a6d5-21b1dad42d39\">a sweeping curtailment</a> of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, a group of potent greenhouse gases used in air conditioners and refrigerators, as the regulator advances revived emissions goals under the Biden administration. </p> <p><strong>Bill and Melinda Gates to divorce </strong>Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, and his wife Melinda have announced they are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04f3eaff-075a-495d-975b-50f2bd652eba\">ending their marriage</a> after 27 years.

But Spacs, which raise money from investors to complete a merger and take a company public, have suddenly <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/99de2333-e53a-4084-8780-2ba9766c70b7\">lost their lustre</a> — not least in the eyes of regulators.</p> <p><strong>Wall St rallies behind one of its own in New York mayoral race</strong> Ray McGuire's campaign for New York mayor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/20d73cf0-f389-4a8b-b24b-d812029d8f77\">has been turbocharged</a> by donations from the city's close-knit corporate dealmaking community.

If technological prowess, rather than young men, is the key to future power, China is well placed.</p> <p><strong>Not all blue-collar workers will find green-collar jobs </strong>Today's blue-collar workers are tomorrow's “green-collar” workers — or so politicians would have us believe. The truth is that the road to net zero will destroy jobs in some carbon-intensive sectors as it creates new ones elsewhere. And some activities will not need as many workers as before, <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/6133f8d7-a8a8-4f7a-83b6-d063ea98e3b9\">writes Sarah O'Connor</a>.</p> <p><strong>Workers can use their voice if they come together</strong> The gift that 2020 gave us was space and a chance to work out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54453a46-8cfd-4c1b-bd12-22a82b0b0732\">what is good and bad in our lives</a> and reimagine it to be more sustainable.
