  "title": "J&J Talc Claims May Not Belong in Charlotte Bankruptcy Court, Judge Says; A bankruptcy judge questioned if a chapter 11 filing covering talc-related injury liabilities should be heard in North Carolina",
  "text": "<p>J&amp;J formed the subsidiary, LTL Management LLC, on Oct. 12 and it filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 14. Filing bankruptcies in states far from corporate headquarters is common practice in large corporate restructurings, but feeds public perception that chapter 11 rules tilt the playing field in favor of large institutions, according to some legal researchers.</p><p>LTL Management's chapter 11 filing effectively shifts to North Carolina the fate of nearly 40,000 pending lawsuits alleging talc used in Johnson's Baby Powder caused ovarian cancer, asbestos poisoning and other illnesses. J&amp;J maintains its talc-based products, which it stopped selling in the U.S. and Canada last year, don't cause ovarian cancer and haven't contained asbestos.</p><p>The new J&amp;J subsidiary's only connections to North Carolina are a bank account and its having been created there, Judge Whitley said. Its chapter 11 filing also raises questions about the corporate reorganization J&amp;J undertook before LTL Management sought bankruptcy protection, the judge said. LTL Management said in a court filing that it has a Bank of America N.A. account in Charlotte.</p><p>J&amp;J first shifted its talc-related liabilities and assets to a Texas subsidiary, using a law in that state that authorizes splitting corporate assets from liabilities through what are known as divisional mergers. The Texas subsidiary was subsequently converted to a North Carolina-based company shortly before the chapter 11 filing.</p><p>The bankruptcy court in Charlotte is overseeing other bankruptcies involving divisional mergers employed by companies to hive off asbestos liabilities. Judge Whitley said he has questions about subsidiaries accessing bankruptcy relief following such a transaction, and that he couldn't think of a reason why his district in North Carolina \"needs to be the arbiter of that\" for all other bankruptcy courts.</p><p>\"You've got some convincing to do that we're in the right place, here,\" Judge Whitley said, adding that he would keep an open mind about it.</p><p>Judge Whitley also said he had practical concerns about administering LTL Management's case. The Western District of North Carolina, which also has courthouses in Shelby and Asheville, \"is a small, underserved court,\" he said. Because of conflicts involving a different judge overseeing other cases in the district, LTL Management's talc bankruptcy is \"stuck with me,\" Judge Whitley said.</p><p>He also said his schedule is limited and it is unclear whether he can dedicate enough time to managing LTL Management's bankruptcy.</p><p>Forum shopping in bankruptcy has been debated for decades. Supporters of the current system, which gives companies a wide berth in steering cases to preferred venues, view traditionally busy bankruptcy venues like Delaware and New York as beneficial to all parties involved because judges there are most experienced in complex corporate restructuring.</p><p>Critics say lax venue rules create conditions in which judges compete for large bankruptcies often handled in states far from where employees of bankrupt companies live.</p><p>Congress is considering legislation that would tighten forum selection rules. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and John Cornyn (R., Texas) have reintroduced legislation that would require corporations or wealthy individuals to file chapter 11 either in their home state or where they have significant assets.</p><p>In court filings, LTL Management accused personal-injury lawyers of forum-shopping themselves, saying law firms strategically placed advertising for talc-related claims in markets where they sued J&amp;J and its affiliates.</p><p>J&amp;J has defeated some lawsuits and lost others, resulting in roughly $3.5 billion in settlements and verdicts, according to court papers. The company has said bankruptcy provides a forum to fairly compensate all claimants, and likely quicker than through the traditional trial system.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p>",
