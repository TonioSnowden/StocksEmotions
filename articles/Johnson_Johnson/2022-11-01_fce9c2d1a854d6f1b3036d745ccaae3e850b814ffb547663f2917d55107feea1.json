  "title": "Stocks Rise Ahead of Fed Meeting; The Federal Reserve is broadly expected to conclude its two-day meeting with another 0.75-percentage-point rise in interest rates",
  "text": "<p>Indexes have rebounded strongly in recent weeks, with the Dow closing out October with its best monthly performance since 1976. It rose 14% during the month while the S&amp;P 500 ended 8% higher. Corporate earnings have largely proved better than feared while hopes have lingered that the Fed could soon begin easing its campaign of interest-rate rises.</p><p>Asian indexes jumped as rumors swirled that China was considering relaxing its strict Covid-19 policies which have crimped growth in the world's second-largest economy. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 5.2% while the Shanghai Composite Index gained 2.6% and Japan's Nikkei 225 edged up 0.3%.</p><p>\"I think you can't ignore rumors like this because it is such a big theme that the market has been worrying about for so long,\" said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.</p><p>Fed officials are set to begin a two-day monetary policy meeting Tuesday and are broadly expected to undertake a further 0.75-percentage-point increase in rates. Comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell following the end of the meeting Wednesday could offer clues about whether the central bank will adjust its course on monetary policy.</p><p>While the meeting could be the Fed's last 0.75-percentage-point increase of this cycle of rate rises, hopes that the economy will emerge unscathed are misplaced, said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. Recent stock market gains are likely to be temporary as the lagging effect of global interest rate rises and high inflation begins to bite early next year, he said.</p><p>Hopes that the Fed would soon ease off from its rate rises drove a fleeting rally during the summer, and similar hopes were driving recent gains, Mr. Redha said.</p><p>\"We are in the phase where there is still hope that we can get through this mess, with all these very significant distortions, without too much painâ€”hope springs eternal,\" Mr. Redha said. \"The path to a recession can often look like a soft landing.\"</p><p>Hopes that central banks will relax their fight against inflation if their economies are suffering have been persistent and helped lift stocks in recent weeks. Those hopes took a knock after reported comments from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde suggested raising rates to fight inflation took precedence over economic growth.</p><p>The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fell to 3.946% from 4.074% on Monday. German 10-year government bond yields also dropped, to 2.048%.</p><p>Ahead of the opening bell, shares of Abiomed soared more than 50% after Johnson &amp; Johnson said it would buy the company. Uber rose 7.3% after reporting that revenue climbed last quarter.</p><p>Airbnb, Mondelez International, Prudential Financial and American International Group are due to report after markets close.</p><p>This earnings season has seen mixed results from America's largest corporations. Some sectors have fared better than feared amid the dual threats of rising interest rates and inflation. Technology firms have fared poorly however and are suffering under higher rates.</p><p>In commodity markets, prices for oil and metals rose, lifted by hopes for Chinese demand. Brent crude oil gained 2.3% to $94.93 a barrel while copper prices in London added 3.4% to $7,693.50 a metric ton.</p><p>In Europe, indexes were also broadly higher. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gained 1.3% led by retailers and resources companies.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rise Ahead of Fed Meeting</p>",
