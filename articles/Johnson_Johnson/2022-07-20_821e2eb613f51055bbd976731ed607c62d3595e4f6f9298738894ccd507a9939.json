  "text": "<p>As a result, J&amp;J is being more selective in its spending, including on hiring new employees, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said on Tuesday.</p><p>\"It's forcing us to probably be a little bit more discretionary in terms of investments we're able to make,\" he said. He added that J&amp;J will give priority to research and development, however, for which spending rose 9.1% in the second quarter.</p><p>The company now sees full-year sales up between 2.1% and 3.1%, down from a prior guidance of 3.8% to 4.8%. J&amp;J now expects adjusted earnings for the year to grow between 2.1% and 3.1%, down from a prior forecast of 3.6% to 5.6%. The lowered view is largely due to the stronger dollar, Johnson &amp; Johnson said on Tuesday.</p><p>Sales increased 3% in the second quarter. Currency-exchange trends reduced overall sales growth by 5 percentage points.</p><p>J&amp;J's pharmaceutical unit, which makes the cancer drug Darzalex, continued to post strong growth, which helped offset declines in its medical-device and consumer-health units. Pharmaceutical sales rose 6.7%, versus a 1.1% decline in medical-device sales and a 1.3% decrease in consumer-health sales.</p><p>Tight Covid-19 pandemic restrictions in China reduced hospital procedures that used J&amp;J medical devices, which curbed overall sales growth for the device division, Mr. Wolk said.</p><p>J&amp;J's new chief executive, Joaquin Duato, said Tuesday the company continues to pursue mergers and acquisitions, and that beefing up the medical-device unit is a top priority for deals.</p><p>J&amp;J logged $544 million in revenue for its Covid-19 vaccine, with international buyers accounting for most of those sales. U.S. vaccine sales declined about 11.5%. In the same period a year earlier, J&amp;J's Covid-19 vaccine sales were $164 million.</p><p>But the company also took a second-quarter charge of about $276 million for a reduction in research and manufacturing capacity for the shots, citing a global surplus of Covid-19 vaccine doses.</p><p>The shot is one of four vaccines for Covid-19 authorized or approved in the U.S., with Novavax Inc.'s vaccine most recently winning authorization. But use of the J&amp;J shot in the U.S. has lagged behind that of vaccines developed by rival manufacturers Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. U.S. health regulators briefly paused the use of the J&amp;J vaccine in April of last year as they investigated rare blood-clotting conditions.</p><p>About 17.1 million Americans have been vaccinated with J&amp;J's single-dose shot, a fraction of the number who have been immunized with shots made by Moderna and by Pfizer and BioNTech SE, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those companies' booster shots have also seen far more use in the U.S. than J&amp;J's.</p><p>In the second quarter, J&amp;J posted overall sales of $24 billion, compared with $23.3 billion a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting quarterly sales of $23.77 billion.</p><p>Profit was $4.81 billion, or $1.80 a share, down from $6.28 billion, or $2.35 a share, a year earlier. Adjusted for one-time costs, J&amp;J's per-share profit was $2.59. Wall Street analysts had been forecasting an adjusted profit of $2.54, according to FactSet.</p><p>J&amp;J reiterated its plan to separate its consumer-health business into a stand-alone company in 2023.</p><p>Shares of J&amp;J declined 1.5% on Tuesday amid a market rally.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
