  "text": "<p>In a joint statement Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration said they are reviewing six U.S. cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) that occurred among the 6.8 million who have received J&amp;J's vaccine. All six were women between ages 18 and 48, and symptoms occurred six to 13 days after vaccination.</p><p>This particular brain blood clot is extremely rare in the general population -- five individuals per million per year, with higher rates among those under the age of 18 -- and deadly. \"Treatment of this specific type of blood clot is different from the treatment that might typically be administered,\" the agencies explained. Heparin -- the usual clotting treatment -- \"may be dangerous, and alternative treatments need to be given.\" Now doctors are on high alert for such clots and can prepare appropriate treatment.</p><p>The CDC plans to convene its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Wednesday to \"review these cases and assess their potential significance.\" This will let scientists examine commonalities among cases and consider if the vaccine shouldn't be given to certain individuals who may be at higher risk for clots.</p><p>J&amp;J's Phase 3 clinical trial included some 44,000 participants, which is enough to assess efficacy and overall safety, but not to identify very rare side effects. So it should give Americans confidence that U.S. regulators were able to identify the CVST cases in J&amp;J recipients. The government's vaccine adverse-reaction reporting system is working.</p><p>Some argue that the government's decision to pause J&amp;J inoculations \"out of an abundance of caution\" will amplify public fears about vaccines. This is a risk. But regulators need to consider what's the best path to reassuring people who are still unvaccinated that J&amp;J and other approved vaccines are safe. Brushing aside highly public cases of severe side effects would also make some Americans more wary and delay herd immunity.</p><p>Shipments of J&amp;J's vaccine were expected to fall 80% this week to about 700,000, but supply of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are increasing. FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock said later Tuesday that \"we expect it to be a matter of days for this pause,\" in which case there will be a de minimis effect on the U.S. vaccine rollout.</p><p>The Biden Administration could have done a better job communicating -- ditto the click-bait media -- but showing some caution will provide an antidote to vaccine anxiety.</p><p>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: Numbers Don't Add Up for the Vaccine Pause\" -- WSJ Apr. 21, 2021)</p>",
