  "text": "<p>The researchers found that the Moderna vaccine's effectiveness against hospitalization was 93%, compared with 88% for Pfizer-BioNTech's and 71% for J&amp;J's.

They added that although there are differences in vaccine effectiveness, all three of the vaccines provide substantial protection against hospitalization.</p><p>The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines also produced higher post-vaccination antibody levels than the J&amp;J vaccine, the researchers said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
