  "title": "Aaron Rodgers and How A Team Pulls Through",
  "text": "<p>The reason Love played Sunday, of course, was that Rodgers, the \"Jeopardy\" guest host, reigning NFL MVP and Green Bay's quarterback No. 1, was absent due to his testing positive for Covid-19 -- an unfortunate event that placed him into the league's protocol for unvaccinated players, and kicked off yet another mind-numbing collision of sports and the American culture wars.</p><p>Rodgers is perfectly within his rights to not get vaccinated, which he declined, he said during a lengthy appearance on the \"Pat McAfee Show,\" not because he is opposed to vaccinations, but because he has an allergy to an ingredient in the mRNA Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. At the same time, he also said he had concerns about side effects in the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, as well as worries about possible impact on male fertility, not to mention his frustrations about the politicization of the pandemic and the unchecked power of pharmaceutical companies.</p><p>He said all of this while wearing a T-shirt depicting the Wyatt Earp associate Doc Holliday, who, as more than a few people pointed out on the Internet, died of tuberculosis, an infectious respiratory disease.</p><p>Medical authorities might challenge elements of Rodgers's explanation, but not getting vaxxed is, once more, utterly his choice, the workplace consequences of which the 37-year-old quarterback is experiencing right now. (Protocol will likely keep Rodgers away from the Packers until Nov. 13. Healthwise, Rodgers told McAfee he experienced some symptoms, but now feels good.) The NFL recommends the vaccine, but it does not have a player mandate; the league's Covid-19 protocols were collectively bargained with its players association and agreed upon before the season. As an unvaccinated player, Rodgers said he is tested daily and asked to adhere to strict rules on masking and social distancing. He said he has been doing all of this with the Packers. They all knew his status, he said.</p><p>Except the public did not, and that's what really stirred the ruckus here. At an August news conference, when directly asked if he was vaccinated, Rodgers said, \"Yeah, I've been immunized,\" which was incorrectly taken as a confirmation of a jab. Rodgers said he did not lie, or intend to mislead, that he'd undergone an immunization treatment that he hoped the NFL would accept as equivalent to a vaccination (the NFL did not). At the very least, it appeared to be some artful slyness, a bit like watching a receiver pretending to have caught a football that bounced off the ground.</p><p>Again, context: Rodgers is one person, and he is far from the only athlete or NFL player or even quarterback to decline vaccination. It's the slipperiness that riled up overlords like the Hall of Fame pooh-bahs on Fox's NFL show, who unanimously roasted Rodgers on Sunday.</p><p>\"I'm extremely disappointed in the actions of Aaron Rodgers,\" Terry Bradshaw said.</p><p>Rodgers seems to have anticipated such blowback. In his appearance with McAfee, he hit the 2021 buzzterm trifecta -- \"cancel culture,\" \"woke mob,\" \"critical thinker\" -- and quoted Martin Luther King in explaining his resistance to news conference masking, a condition for unvaccinated players. He ruefully predicted he would be \"canceled by the left\" and \"championed by the right\" and disassociated himself from both sides. (\"I don't give a [expletive] about either of them,\" Rodgers said. \"Politics is a total sham.\") He made fair points about the partisan freight of the moment, and the uselessness of shame in convincing the unvaxxed.</p><p>At times, Rodgers sounded quite placid and reasonable.</p><p>At other times, he sounded two minutes away from telling us Jim Morrison is alive and running a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont.</p><p>Which is also his right, of course. We are living in a golden age of amateur expertise and self-interest rebranded as personal liberty, and quarterbacks are historically twitchy personalities with coteries of independent advisers and maverick streaks. Let's not forget the prolonged suspense of this past offseason, when it was unclear if Rodgers wanted to return to the Packers, or be traded elsewhere. \"You guys know me, I march to the beat of my own drum,\" he told McAfee, a comment that is charmingly self-aware, but lands differently amid a pandemic.</p><p>Here's Dr. Myron Rolle, a former NFL player and global neurosurgery fellow at Harvard, talking about Rodgers on TV the other day: \"I see someone who is making a decision in a silo -- really self-serving, all looking inwards and thinking about himself as opposed to the larger, bigger scheme of the team, the community.\"</p><p>And that's really it here -- this situation is bigger than Rodgers, or the Packers, or football, or me, or you, or any one person, and the path out of it is seeing ourselves as part of something bigger than ourselves. It isn't hard to see a bright parallel to team sports, and that's what cranks up Dr. Rolle and the Fox NFL guys. No one from Bart Starr to Vince Lombardi to Reggie White was able to do it by himself -- success in football requires a full roster and a pathological commitment to sacrificing individual want for the good of the group.</p><p>Aaron Rodgers knows this. He has accomplished marvelous feats in his football career, but he knows by now he can't win alone. None of us can.</p>",
