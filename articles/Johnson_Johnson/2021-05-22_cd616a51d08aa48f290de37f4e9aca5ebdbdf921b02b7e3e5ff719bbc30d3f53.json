  "text": "<p>   Public-health officials are pressing rich governments, including the U.S., to do more to help poor nations that are now at the center of the pandemic, as the devastating outbreak in India continues to exacerbate vaccine shortages in the developing world. </p><p>   India, where overwhelmed hospitals are short of beds, oxygen and other lifesaving Covid-19 treatments, this week announced the highest death toll recorded by any country during the pandemic, with 4,529 deaths counted over 24 hours on Tuesday. Public officials say that figure vastly undercounts the true death toll. </p><p>   The Serum Institute of India, the world's biggest vaccine maker, has said it only expects to resume exports of Covid-19 shots at the end of the year, including to Covax, the World Health Organization-backed initiative to immunize developing countries. The Indian government has restricted the export of shots so it can inoculate the country's more than 1.3 billion citizens. </p><p>   Covax -- which aims to vaccinate around one billion people by the end of the year -- has ordered a total of 1.1 billion vaccine doses from the Serum Institute, its main supplier, although some of these weren't expected to be delivered until 2022. </p><p>   A Covax spokesman said the initiative still hopes that some deliveries from the Serum Institute will resume in the third quarter, albeit at reduced quantities. Covax previously said that it urgently needs at least 140 million doses, which it had been expecting from the Serum Institute by the end of May, to finish vaccinating healthcare workers in developing countries. </p><p>   Unicef, which helps deliver vaccines on behalf of Covax, said earlier this week that the facility's shortfall is likely to increase to 190 million doses by the end of June. As a result, public-health authorities and developing countries are redoubling requests for more vaccine doses and other types of support that the rich world could send right away. </p><p>   President Biden said Monday that the U.S. would share 20 million doses of vaccines made by Pfizer Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson and Moderna Inc. with the rest of the world by the end of June. That comes on top of a previous U.S. pledge to donate 60 million shots developed by AstraZeneca PLC and the University of Oxford. </p><p>   Earlier this month, the administration threw its support behind proposals to waive the intellectual property underlying the Covid-19 vaccines as a way to increase production of shots, particularly in the developing world. But public-health officials and authorities in poor countries don't expect the waiver -- which could take months to negotiate -- to have an impact until at least 2022. </p><p>   Health-policy experts say the U.S. can do much more later this year. Andrea Taylor, assistant director of programs at Duke University's Global Health Institute, said that the U.S. will be the first country in the G-7 club of rich nations to have manufacturing capacity that exceeds its domestic need, given that 38% of Americans are fully vaccinated and some people will decline to be inoculated. She said most of the U.S. doses exported over the next few months would likely be sold rather than donated. </p><p>   France has said it would donate 500,000 vaccine doses to poor countries by mid-June. Other European countries, including the U.K., have said that they would also share doses, but most have yet to make specific commitments. </p><p>   The world's poorest 50 countries account for just 2% of the Covid-19 vaccines administered globally so far, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Just 3% of Indians are fully vaccinated. In Africa -- the continent most dependent on Covax -- just 0.5% of the 1.4 billion people are fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data, a project based at Oxford University. </p><p></p>",
