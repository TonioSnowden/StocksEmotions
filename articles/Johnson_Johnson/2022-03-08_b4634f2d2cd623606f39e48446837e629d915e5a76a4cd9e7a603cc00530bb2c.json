  "title": "Jones Day Cleared to Represent J&J's Bankrupt Talc Subsidiary; A bankruptcy judge said Jones Day didn't have a disqualifying conflict of interest from helping J&J push its talc liability into a subsidiary now in chapter 11",
  "text": "<p>Judge Kaplan said Jones Day's work for J&amp;J, which ended two days before the recently-formed talc subsidiary filed chapter 11 in October, doesn't mean the law firm will favor the interests of the parent company over its bankrupt unit, LTL Management LLC.</p><p>Instead, the judge said evidence shows that LTL and J&amp;J have a shared interest in settling the talc liability in chapter 11. That fact ensures that neither Jones Day nor LTL could give priority to a competing interest favoring J&amp;J that could influence the bankruptcy case, Judge Kaplan said.</p><p>The ruling marks another setback for committees representing about 38,000 plaintiffs who allege Johnson's Baby Powder caused ovarian cancer or contained asbestos, which the company denies. Late last month, Judge Kaplan approved the 2021 restructuring transaction overseen by Jones Day that spun-off the talc liabilities of J&amp;J's consumer health business to LTL.</p><p>Formed in October, the new subsidiary filed bankruptcy just days after its creation, carrying with it the liability for current and future talc claims. J&amp;J has offered $2 billion to settle the talc liability through LTL's chapter 11 and has entered into an uncapped funding agreement requiring the parent company to cover any additional costs associated with the bankruptcy case.</p><p>The committees representing talc claimants argued the restructuring that created LTL was executed for the purpose of capping J&amp;J's talc liability, which by extension pits Jones Day against plaintiffs seeking to recover as much money as they can from the consumer goods giant.</p><p>Jeffrey Sponder, a lawyer for the Justice Department's U.S. Trustee Program, said the 2021 restructuring would be a central focus of the bankruptcy and that Jones Day was instrumental in engineering the transaction while working for J&amp;J.</p><p>Now, Jones Day as LTL's counsel has a mandate under bankruptcy law to recover as much money as possible for talc claimants using the same documents the firm drafted to minimize J&amp;J's liability, Mr. Sponder said.</p><p>\"The problem for Jones Day is that it will be negotiating over a transaction that it designed when it was working for J&amp;J on the other side of the table,\" Mr. Sponder said.</p><p>Judge Kaplan disputed those allegations and said the restructuring that created LTL won't be central to the chapter 11 case. The key issue is whether talc claimants and LTL can reach an agreement that resolves LTL's liability, he said.</p><p>Greg Gordon, a Jones Day lawyer representing LTL, also denied the U.S. Trustee's allegations, and said there was no reason to doubt the law firm would do anything but maximize recoveries for talc claimants in chapter 11.</p><p>Mr. Gordon said the firm's representation of J&amp;J ended on Oct. 12, two days before LTL filed bankruptcy. Jones Day has also represented J&amp;J on intellectual property matters unrelated to the restructuring or the chapter 11 case, he said.</p><p>LTL and J&amp;J have a shared interest in reaching a fair and equitable resolution to the talc litigation in chapter 11, Mr. Gordon said.</p><p>Judge Kaplan said Jones Day won't be involved in future disputes, should any arise, regarding the funding agreement or the prebankruptcy restructuring that created LTL. And going forward, injury lawyers could again challenge LTL's retention of Jones Day if any new evidence came to light that would warrant additional review by the court, he added.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p>",
