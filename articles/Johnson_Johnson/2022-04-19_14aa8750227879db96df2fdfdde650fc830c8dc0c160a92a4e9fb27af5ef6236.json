  "title": "Stocks Climb as Earnings Season Ramps Up; Quarterly results are due from Netflix and IBM after markets close",
  "text": "<p>The gains were broad-based, with 10 of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors advancing. Only the energy group, the top-performing sector this year, declined.</p><p>Travel stocks were among the strongest performers after a federal judge threw out the requirement that travelers in the U.S. wear masks on airplanes and other forms of mass transit. American Airlines Group shares rose 5.8%, Las Vegas Sands shares gained 4.6% and Carnival shares added 5%.</p><p>\"If you actually look at TSA traveler traffic, if you look at hotel bookings, for example, those are two areas that still have not really fully recovered from their pandemic lows,\" said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer at Mercer Advisors. \"So I think that's a huge tailwind.\"</p><p>The market is in the thick of earnings season with dozens of big U.S. companies expected to report this week. Given high inflation, investors are watching for signs of which firms are able to preserve their profits by passing higher costs along to customers through price increases.</p><p>Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson gained 2.6% after the pharmaceutical firm beat earnings expectations. Travelers fell 5.2% despite reporting higher earnings and lifting its dividend.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note kept climbing. The yield on the benchmark bond rose to 2.911% from 2.861% on Monday, which was the highest settlement since December 2018.</p><p>Bond yields rise as prices fall, and investors have been selling bonds on expectations of high inflation and interest-rate increases from the Federal Reserve.</p><p>\"Fixed income has been a particular point of pain. This is the worst bear market in bonds we've seen in a generation,\" said Brian O'Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum International Funds.</p><p>Concerns about inflation—which has soared to multidecade highs—and how central banks might respond have dominated investors' thinking for months, but so far corporate finances have been protected as firms have largely managed to pass higher costs on to consumers. Investors say they are expecting earnings growth to moderate this quarter as it becomes harder for companies to continue raising consumer costs.</p><p>\"The longer prices stay high, the longer the war in Ukraine continues, the higher likelihood that something has to give. Corporations cannot continue to pass on input costs forever,\" said Mr. O'Reilly. \"There has to be a tipping point.\"</p><p>Other stock movers included American Campus Communities, which jumped 13% after The Wall Street Journal reported that Blackstone is buying the student-housing owner in a deal valued at $12.8 billion.</p><p>Plug Power shares rose 9.9% after the alternative energy company said it had struck a deal with Walmart to supply the retailer with hydrogen.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, fell 4.7% to $107.87 a barrel. U.S. natural gas fell 9%, continuing a volatile stretch for the fuel. Gold prices declined 1.5%.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 dropped 0.8%. In Asia, stock markets were mixed. The Nikkei 225 rose 0.7% as Japan's yen fell to a 20-year low against the dollar. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 2.3%, dragged lower by technology firms.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Karen Langley at karen.langley@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Climb as Earnings Season Ramps Up</p>",
