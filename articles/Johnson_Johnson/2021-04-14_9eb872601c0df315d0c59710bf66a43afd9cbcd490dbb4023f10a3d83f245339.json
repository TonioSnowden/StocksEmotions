  "text": "<p>Global equities hovered around record highs, with investors holding back from making big bets as US businesses began reporting first-quarter earnings and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus\">coronavirus crisis</a> worsened in several regions. </p> <p>Wall Street's S&amp;P 500 index of blue-chip companies closed 0.4 per cent lower in New York after hitting a fresh high a day earlier. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, more sensitive to economic growth pushing interest rates higher, slid almost 1 per cent. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield edged 0.02 percentage points higher to 1.63 per cent. </p> <p>Across the Atlantic, the region-wide Stoxx Europe 600 equity benchmark index closed up 0.2 per cent, inching back towards its record level achieved on Friday last week. London's FTSE 100 added 0.7 per cent but Frankfurt's Xetra Dax dipped 0.2 per cent. </p> <p>The moves came as JPMorgan, America's largest bank by assets, reported a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0595526e-48fa-48ff-a594-d219f15b54a4\">fivefold gain</a> in profits because it did not have to use billions of dollars it had set aside for covering bad loans. Demand for new loans, however, remained weak, warned the bank. </p> <p>Investors also kept their caution over the rollout of coronavirus vaccines after the drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson on Tuesday said it would delay the distribution of its vaccine in Europe. This came after US health agencies called for a pause of the jab's use on Americans while they investigated several rare incidents of blood clots. </p> <p>Infections are continuing to surge in Brazil and India, while cases of the Covid-19 variant first detected in South Africa have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/155767a2-81e3-4cfb-a662-dec6ffd36c2f\">found in the UK</a>.</p> <p>“There is a bit of fear coming back,” said Paul Jackson, head of asset allocation research at fund manager Invesco. But with the returns on credit assets very weak, investors had few moneymaking opportunities beyond stocks, he said. “All news is good news at the moment and everything is a pretext for equity indices to go up.” </p> <p>Real yields on US 10-year and 20-year Treasury bonds, which measure returns on government debt once inflation is taken into account, are <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=realyield\">below zero</a>, pinned down by the US central bank buying about $120bn of the assets each month. “As investors sell debt securities to the Federal Reserve, they have to put the money into another asset,” said Jackson. “So that is stocks or commodities.” </p> <p>Despite real yields remaining negative, nominal Treasury yields have risen rapidly from about 0.9 per cent for the 10-year note at the start of this year. Investors sold off the debt in anticipation of a jolt of inflation from US president Joe Biden's multitrillion dollar stimulus schemes.</p> <p>The Treasury market has steadied in recent weeks, however, as investors have accepted the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b927a7c-b459-46df-ab49-54daca7e58c6\">view </a>of Fed chair Jay Powell that surges in inflation would be temporary. </p> <p>“Treasury markets are following chair Powell's recommendation to treat the next few months of&#xa0;inflation&#xa0;data as throwaways — transient observations with little useful signal,” said Nicholas Colas of DataTrek Research. </p> <p>The dollar slid 0.2 per cent against a basket of currencies, while sterling and the euro both rose 0.2 per cent versus the greenback to $1.3783 and $1.1977, respectively. </p> <p>In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 1.4 per cent while the Shanghai Composite ended the day 0.6 per cent higher. Tokyo's Nikkei stock average was down 0.4 per cent while the S&amp;P/ASX 200 in Sydney was up 0.7 per cent.</p><p>Source: Naomi Rovnick and Joe Rennison 2021 'Global stocks have a mixed day as US earnings season kicks off' FT.com 14 April.
