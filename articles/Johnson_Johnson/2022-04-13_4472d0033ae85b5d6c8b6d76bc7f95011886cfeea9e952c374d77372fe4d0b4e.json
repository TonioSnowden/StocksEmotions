  "text": "<p>   The Securities and Exchange Commission accused a Las Vegas lawyer and six other men of violating federal securities law for their involvement in an alleged Ponzi scheme that raised around $450 million from investors. </p><p>   The alleged scheme unraveled last month when authorities said attorney Matthew Beasley confessed to running a Ponzi scheme after he was shot by federal agents who had come to his house March 3. In a Ponzi scheme, early investors are paid with funds raised from later investors while the money raised is generally not invested. </p><p>   Mr. Beasley and Jeffrey Judd, president of J&amp;J Consulting Services, Inc. and two similarly named entities involved in the alleged scheme, were named as defendants, along with five men who worked to promote the companies. </p><p>   J&amp;J raised funds from investors saying they were providing advances to people who had settled personal-injury lawsuits. A lawyer for Mr. Judd in civil matters said he was a victim of Mr. Beasley's misrepresentations. A lawyer for Mr. Beasley didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p></p>",
