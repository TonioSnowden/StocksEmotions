  "text": "<p>BioNTech and Pfizer plan to manufacture an additional 500m doses of their Covid-19 vaccine this year, bringing their production target to 2.5bn shots. </p> <p>The German biotechnology group said in its annual earnings report on Tuesday that increased output was possible thanks to optimised production processes and an expansion of its manufacturing and supply network.</p> <p>“We have increased our supply target for 2021 to 2.5bn doses,” said Ugur Sahin, chief executive. “This will require further process improvements and further expansion of our supplier and [marketing] network, but we believe we are on track to achieve this.”</p> <p>The company also aims to formulate two alternative versions of the vaccine that can be stored in refrigerators or freeze-dried, he added. </p> <p>A refrigerated version would remove one of the jab's major drawbacks compared with rival vaccine makers such as AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson, which can already be stored at warmer temperatures.</p> <p>“We are fast-tracking the development of the ready-to-use formulation and do not currently expect additional clinical studies to be required,” Sahin said.</p> <p>The rush to inoculate against coronavirus has forced producers into a global race to increase capacity and ensure supply lines. Pfizer and BioNTech, which partnered to create the vaccine known as BNT162b2, or Comirnaty, initially pledged to produce 1.3bn doses of the breakthrough shot in 2021 before increasing the target to 2bn in January.</p> <p>Sean Marett, chief commercial officer, said the company had improved its capacity thanks to an additional factory in Marburg, Germany, as well as EU approval for a sixth dose to be administered from each vial. There are “firm orders” for 1.4bn doses, which would bring the company approximately €9.8bn from its share of the sales.</p> <p>The US had exercised its option for an additional 100m doses, bringing its total to 300m, he said, while the EU would receive an additional 200m to a total of 500m, with the option to order 100m more.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/a15cccbe-6059-471c-894f-7bd1188e426f.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The company has previously said it splits profits with Pfizer 50-50 outside China, where it gets a 35-40 per cent share of gross profit in a deal with Fosun Pharma.</p> <p>The vaccine partners, followed by US biotech group Moderna, were the first to bring a Covid-19 jab to market and to get approval for a vaccine using messenger RNA technology. </p> <p>In the months since the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine was released, they have rushed to improve storage and dispatch compared with rivals.</p> <p>The European Medicines Agency recently approved the transport of the Pfizer vaccine at minus 15C, an easier task than at the original minus 25C.</p> <p>Sahin said a freeze-dried version of the jab would start trials in April. If results released this summer are promising, that could allow countries to stockpile it for future use. </p> <p>“We learned from our Covid-19 experience that product development can be faster,” Sahin said. “We intend to apply the capabilities and learnings we developed [ . . . ] to rapidly advance our pipeline products toward the market.”</p> <p>The EMA on Friday approved BioNTech's Marburg plant to produce the vaccine. The company acquired the site in October and aims to make 1bn jabs there by the end of the year.</p> <p>The biotech group has reported €366.9m in fourth-quarter profit, compared with a €58.2m loss a year earlier. At the year's end, it said it had €1.2bn in cash.</p> <p>The company plans to use some of its revenues from the coronavirus vaccine in other research, including into cancer, one of its original focuses before the pandemic. It anticipates it will spend up to €850m on research and development this year.</p> <p>“We believe that mRNA will revolutionise the field of immunology, and BioNTech is well-placed to continue to lead the revolution,” Sahin said.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e6f487f4-a7d9-4e90-b9cb-ef8d25803bec.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Erika Solomon in Berlin 2021 'BioNTech lifts Covid vaccine target to 2.5bn doses this year' FT.com 30 March.
