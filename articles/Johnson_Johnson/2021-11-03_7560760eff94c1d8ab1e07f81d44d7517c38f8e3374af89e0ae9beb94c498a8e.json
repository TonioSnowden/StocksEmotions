  "title": "Republicans Oppose Bill Aimed at Banning Certain Corporate Bankruptcy Strategies; GOP lawmakers described the Democrats' proposal as an overreaction to chapter 11 cases involving Purdue Pharma and a Johnson & Johnson subsidiary",
  "text": "<p>Despite GOP opposition, Democrats moved the proposed legislation to the full House for further consideration with a 23-17 party-line committee vote. The Senate is considering a companion bill with the same name, the Nondebtor Release Prohibition Act, that is supported by dozens of consumer and advocacy groups.</p><p>The House bill is a response to recent corporate bankruptcy moves that many criticized. In the Purdue Pharma case, members of the Sackler family who own the OxyContin maker received legal release from lawsuits accusing them of contributing to the nation's opioid epidemic as part of a $4.5 billion settlement. A bankruptcy judge approved the deal in September, a decision that is being appealed by the Justice Department's bankruptcy unit and a handful of state attorneys general.</p><p>Purdue pleaded guilty last year to three federal felonies over its marketing and sale of OxyContin, its flagship opioid painkiller. The Sacklers have denied wrongdoing and last year separately settled civil allegations with the Justice Department for $225 million, without admitting liability.</p><p>Rep. Dan Bishop (R., N.C.) said Wednesday that the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy \"was probably mishandled\" but that the Democrats' bill was an overreaction. Mr. Bishop described the proposal as a \"meat cleaver approach\" that could wreak havoc in the bankruptcy system, but said he is open to discussing more modest changes with Democrats.</p><p>Rep. Scott Fitzgerald (R., Wis.) said his colleagues weren't condoning the actions of Purdue Pharma or the Sacklers and that bankruptcy judges rarely approve such settlements without creditor support. Purdue Pharma's settlement with the Sacklers had broad support from most state attorneys general and groups representing opioid victims and other creditors.</p><p>\"We must be careful not to do anything that would inadvertently limit the ability of a bankruptcy court to use every possible tool to reach an equitable outcome,\" Mr. Fitzgerald said.</p><p>The bill before the House would also let personal-injury claimants or other business creditors seek dismissal of a chapter 11 case if it involved the type of transaction Johnson &amp; Johnson used to move its talc liabilities to bankruptcy court.</p><p>J&amp;J was facing tens of thousands of personal-injury lawsuits alleging that talc used in Johnson's Baby Powder caused ovarian cancer, asbestos poisoning and other illnesses.</p><p>The company first shifted its talc-related liabilities and assets to a Texas subsidiary, using a state law that allows splitting corporate assets from liabilities through what are known as divisional mergers. The Texas subsidiary was subsequently converted into a North Carolina-based company—called LTL Management LLC—shortly before it filed for chapter 11.</p><p>Such corporate restructuring has been used before in other asbestos-related bankruptcies filed in North Carolina. J&amp;J has defeated some lawsuits, lost others and maintained that its baby powder is safe.</p><p>House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) said Wednesday the proposed legislation that he is co-sponsoring was drafted following congressional testimony earlier this year from a mother whose son died from opioid addiction and an Olympic gymnast who was abused by USA Gymnastics' former team doctor. USA Gymnastics filed for chapter 11 in 2018 and has proposed a settlement of sex-abuse claims covering the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, which isn't in bankruptcy, that includes the same type of liability release Purdue Pharma provided members of the Sackler family.</p><p>Mr. Nadler said the bill would address forms of abusive conduct within the bankruptcy system.</p><p>The bill discussed in the House on Wednesday is one of a handful of proposals Congress is considering that would change elements of corporate bankruptcy that have stirred controversy. Federal lawmakers are considering separate proposals that have bipartisan support, including bills that would restrict lenient bankruptcy venue selection rules and address the payment of executive bonuses ahead of a corporate bankruptcy.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Randles at jonathan.randles@wsj.com</p>",
