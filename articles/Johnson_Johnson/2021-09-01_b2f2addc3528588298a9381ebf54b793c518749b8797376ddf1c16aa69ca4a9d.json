  "text": "<p>\"We are updating what it means to be vaccinated,\" said Israel's coronavirus czar, Salman Zarka, on Sunday.</p><p>A study released by the Israeli health ministry on Sunday found that within 12 days, recipients of a third shot were 10 times less likely to become severely ill and 11 times less likely to become infected than people who had received their second dose five months earlier.</p><p>Israeli health officials say they don't know whether additional boosters, beyond the third dose, will be needed. But they are moving aggressively to get as many people as possible vaccinated with a third shot, as the more contagious Delta variant of the virus spreads. All Israelis over the age of 12 are now eligible to receive a booster if five months have passed since their second shot.</p><p>Other countries with widespread vaccination programs are expected to authorize booster shots in the coming months. U.S. regulators are likely to approve in mid-September a Covid-19 booster shot of those manufactured by Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson, for vaccinated adults six months after their previous dose, rather than the eight-month gap previously announced, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.</p><p>After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in the White House on Friday, President Biden said he would also consider lowering the timeline for Americans to five months after the second shot.</p><p>Pfizer and the two other companies whose vaccines have been authorized by U.S. federal regulators say booster shots are shown to increase protection against the risk of infection and illness from the coronavirus.</p><p>Israel's green pass takes the form of code on a smartphone app or a printed certificate. It has been credited with helping to open up Israel's economy after successive lockdowns.</p><p>People show it to gain access to restaurants, bars and other indoor public areas. On Monday, Israel's government also decided that employees in the health, education, and social-welfare sectors must show green passes or a negative Covid-19 test to enter their workplaces.</p><p>Some business owners fear that the additional vaccination requirements could cause complications. Roy Shadur, a 50-year-old restaurateur in the city of Ramat Gan, said that while he had received the third shot, the change to the vaccine-passport requirement could mean shutting his business because it comes without the formal government financial support involved in a mandated full closure.</p><p>His customers, he said, have dwindled as many families prefer to order in rather than get the required negative coronavirus test for their children, who aren't yet eligible for a green pass.</p><p>\"It's just the part that hurts, without the medicine,\" Mr. Shadur said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
