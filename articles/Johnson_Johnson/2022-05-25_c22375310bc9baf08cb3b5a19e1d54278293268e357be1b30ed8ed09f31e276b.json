  "title": "New Study Shows Vaccination Reduces Long Covid Risk, But Modestly; New research shows that long Covid health problems are somewhat less common among vaccinated people who experience breakthrough infections than among unvaccinated people who become infected",
  "text": "<p>Most of the vaccinated people had received two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, while 8% received one dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. The study didn't look at people who had received boosters.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Have you or someone you know experienced long Covid? Share your experience.</p><p>For long Covid symptoms, \"what we see is that the risk reduction conferred by vaccination isn't really huge,\" says Ziyad Al-Aly, chief of research and development at the VA St. Louis Health Care System and a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, who was lead researcher of the study published in thejournal Nature Medicine.</p><p>\"[Vaccination is] not going to be this perfect shield that is going to protect you completely from all the consequences of a SARS-CoV-2 infection,\" he says.</p><p>Vaccination reduces the risk of symptomatic illness with Covid-19, which may also provide one important layer of protection against long Covid. Breakthrough infections are often mild, but have become more common with Omicron and its related subvariants that are better at evading immunity from vaccines as well as from prior infection.</p><p>Other studies so far on whether and how much Covid-19 vaccines can reduce the risk of long Covid have provided mixed findings. Researchers say many studies haven't been peer-reviewed and define long Covid differently, often relying on self-reported data.</p><p>The U.K.'s Health Security Agency published in February an analysis of eight studies, including the VA research before it was peer-reviewed. Six of those studies found that vaccinated people with breakthrough infections were less likely to develop symptoms of long Covid than unvaccinated people. Two other studies concluded that vaccination didn't reduce the chances of developing long Covid.</p><p>Long Covid affects millions of people with a range of symptoms, including brain fog, fatigue and a racing heartbeat. A March government report estimated that long Covid has potentially affected up to 23 million people in the U.S., pushing roughly one million out of work. A report issued Tuesday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found one in five people with Covid-19 between 18 and 64 years old had at least one condition that might be attributable to their Covid infection one month to a year after they were infected. People with Covid-19 had twice the rate of pulmonary embolisms or respiratory conditions.</p><p>The VA used a broader definition of long Covid than some other studies. It included people with both the classic presentation of long Covid—often defined by severe fatigue, cognitive issues and other symptoms—as well as new cardiometabolic conditions surfacing post-Covid, such as new onset diabetes as well as heart and kidney conditions.</p><p>Dr. Al-Aly's group conducted a couple of different analyses to assess the risk of long Covid. In one, epidemiologists examined 13 million patients' data comparing people who experienced breakthrough infections with control groups of people who didn't get Covid-19. Researchers concluded that people with breakthrough infections were more likely to develop health problems attributed to long Covid compared with those control groups.</p><p>Next, researchers compared vaccinated and unvaccinated people who all got Covid. Overall, vaccination reduced the risk of getting long Covid symptoms by about 15%.</p><p>Vaccination provided stronger protection against some long Covid symptoms. The risk of developing pulmonary or blood-clotting disorders was 50% less in people with breakthrough infections compared with unvaccinated people. There was a 28% reduction in fatigue risk; the risk of neurological disease was reduced by 20%.</p><p>Other symptoms had weaker protection. The risk of developing heart disease was reduced by 13% in vaccinated people, while musculoskeletal problems were reduced by 12%.</p><p>\"To me this data is pretty convincing that breakthrough infections are associated with a real risk of long Covid,\" said Steven Deeks, professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco who is heading up a long Covid study there and wasn't involved in the VA study.</p><p>\"Minimally symptomatic nonhospitalized people with breakthrough infections are at risk of developing long Covid. Hard stop. That's an important finding,\" he says.</p><p>Chanel Mattie, a 32-year-old in Los Angeles, got her first two vaccine doses last year. She came down with a mild case of Covid in December, right before she was set to get a booster.</p><p>Five months later, she says she's struggling with symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue, balance problems, and migraines. Ms. Mattie is one of a growing number of patients, many fully vaccinated, infected with Omicron this winter who doctors say are now filtering into long Covid clinics for treatment.</p><p>\"People are like, 'Oh, it's just a cold if you're vaccinated,' \" said Ms. Mattie, who used to work out twice a day. \"It's not just a cold. I've never had a cold produce these types of aftereffects.\"</p><p>Write to Sumathi Reddy at Sumathi.Reddy@wsj.com</p><p>New Study Shows Vaccination Reduces Long Covid Risk, But Modestly</p>",
