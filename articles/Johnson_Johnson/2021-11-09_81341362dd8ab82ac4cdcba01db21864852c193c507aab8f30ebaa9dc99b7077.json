  "title": "Johnson & Johnson Opioid Verdict Overturned by Oklahoma Supreme Court; Justices say district court stepped into shoes of legislature",
  "text": "<p>The lawsuit was thefirst trial in the nation that sought to hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable for widespread opioid addiction and overdoses. During the seven-week trial, lawyers for the state argued Johnson &amp; Johnson was liable.</p><p>The drugmaker was ordered in 2019 to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to help address the damage caused by opioid addiction in Oklahoma. The dollar amount—initially $572 million but later reduced to $465 million—represented an estimated year's worth of treatment and programs.</p><p>\"The district court stepping into the shoes of the legislature by creating and funding government programs designed to address social and health issues goes too far,\" the majority opinion read. \"This Court defers the policy-making to the legislative and executive branches and rejects the unprecedented expansion of public nuisance law.\"</p><p>One justice dissented from the decision, two were disqualified and one was recused.</p><p>The ruling comes after a California judge earlier this month cleared four drugmakers, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, of liability after a monthslong trial accusing the companies of causing widespread opioid addiction in the state.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson said the Oklahoma Court's decision reflected the facts of the case. \"Janssen's actions relating to the marketing and promotion of these important prescription pain medications were appropriate and responsible and did not cause a public nuisance,\" the company said.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson also said it recognized the opioid crisis is a complex public-health issue. \"We have deep sympathy for everyone affected,\" it said.</p><p>Lawyers representing the state didn't immediately respond to request for comment.</p><p>—Sara Randazzo contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jennifer Calfas at jennifer.calfas@wsj.com</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Opioid Verdict Overturned by Oklahoma Supreme Court</p>",
