  "text": "<p>The new vaccine, code-named mRNA-1273.351, is designed to better match the virus variant that was first identified in South Africa but has since spread elsewhere.</p><p>Moderna, which makes the second Covid-19 shot authorized in the U.S., might be the first vaccine maker to have finished the laboratory work of designing a shot targeting variants that started spreading swiftly late last year.</p><p>Other companies including Pfizer Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson have said they are tweaking their vaccines or working on boosters that better match variants. Older vaccines don't appear to work as well against the strain first identified in South Africa, and difficult new strains could also emerge.</p><p>The chase marks a new phase in vaccine research to fight off the coronavirus, indicating that the effort could shift into a long-running contest between a changing virus and shots that can keep up, rather than a shorter push to end the pandemic once and for all.</p><p>Staying ahead of an evolving virus, health experts say, could prove crucial to permitting schools, businesses and other establishments to reopen and to easing other pandemic restrictions.</p><p>Covid-19 vaccines from other companies have shown reduced efficacy in studies in South Africa, and Moderna's vaccine had a more muted effect against the variant in lab tests.</p><p>People who previously received two doses of Moderna's original Covid-19 vaccine will be given the new shot, and researchers will track the vaccine's safety and ability to induce an immune response to the new variant, Moderna said.</p><p>If test results are positive, Moderna will seek U.S. regulatory authorization for the new vaccine, which could happen in the third quarter, Chief Executive Officer Stephane Bancel said in an interview.</p><p>\"Moderna is going to keep chasing those variants of concerns until this pandemic is fully under control,\" Mr. Bancel said. The NIH didn't respond to a request to comment.</p><p>Moderna produced doses for testing about a month after it first said it would develop a modified vaccine against the new variant. Mr. Bancel had said the company could move quickly to make a variant-focused shot, because the messenger RNA technology it uses allows rapid design and quick manufacturing of new or modified vaccines.</p>",
