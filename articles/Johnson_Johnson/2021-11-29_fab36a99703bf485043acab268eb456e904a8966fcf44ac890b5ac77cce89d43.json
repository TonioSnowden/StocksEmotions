  "text": "<p>The new Omicron coronavirus variant has created another threat to the U.S. pandemic response, after new Covid-19 infections reached around 90,000 a day and millions of people spent the past week gathering with family and friends.</p><p>The B.1.1.529 variant, identified last week by scientists in South Africa, has rattled officials in the U.S. and around the world. The U.S. joined other nations in imposing restrictions on some travelers from southern Africa to slow the variant's spread, as U.S. health officials acknowledged it is likely already here.</p><p>President Biden said Monday that his administration was working with officials at Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson to develop contingency plans for vaccines or boosters in case they are needed to combat the Omicron variant. Mr. Biden said that as of now officials don't think such measures will be needed.</p><p>He also said he would soon release more details on how his administration plans to handle Covid-19 this winter, including a focus on more vaccinations, boosters and testing rather than lockdowns. \"This variant is a cause for concern, not a cause for panic,\" he said.</p><p>Officials in New York City on Monday issued an advisory strongly recommending that people wear masks indoors, regardless of their vaccination status. People are already required to wear masks on buses and subways in the nation's largest city. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the broader advisory wasn't yet a mandate.</p><p>\"We still need more data to determine that is the right way to go,\" Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference. \"We want to focus on vaccination.\"</p><p>Much remains unknown about the Omicron variant, including its relative infectiousness, severity or to what degree it might evade the immune response from prior infection or vaccination. Early evidence suggests Omicron might present an increased risk of re-infection compared with other versions of the virus, according to the World Health Organization, but the agency also cautioned that information is limited and more will be known in the coming weeks. </p><p>Ice skaters in Bryant Park in New York City, where officials are encouraging mask-wearing indoors.

The U.S. has invested more in genetic surveillance of Covid-19 variants over the past year, but the amount of sequencing done still varies by state and community.</p><p>Health officials and researchers published sequences from more than 80,000 case samples in the week ending Nov. 20, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up from less than 40,000 a week in April and May of this year. Overall, though, the U.S. has sequenced samples from about 1% of known cases, according to Johns Hopkins University, and lags behind countries such as the U.K. that are monitoring the virus more comprehensively.</p><p>Other variants have emerged and then faded when they were unable to compete with the dominant variant at the time. As of Nov. 20, more than 99.9% of sequenced cases in the U.S. were linked to the Delta variant that drove a surge in cases, hospitalizations and deaths across the country this summer and fall.</p><p>Covid-19 cases in the U.S. have been ticking upward since late October to an average of more than 90,000 a day in late November. Hospital admissions have inched upward as well. Data show a drop in cases over the past few days; there is often a reporting lag around holidays that is typically followed by a bump in new case numbers.</p><p>Federal officials have dispatched medical teams to Michigan to help fight a rise in Covid-19 hospitalizations there and help relieve doctors and nurses, the state's health department said last week.</p><p>Tarini Parti and Jimmy Vielkind contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Brianna Abbott at brianna.abbott@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Watches for Omicron as Covid-19 Infections Remain High</p>",
