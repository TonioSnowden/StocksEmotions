  "text": "<p>For the study, published Jan. 5 in the peer-reviewed journal Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, the researchers tracked six menstrual cycles of about 4,000 study subjects who had received the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc. or Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine or were unvaccinated. It showed that cycles were extended on average by less than a day after one vaccine dose, or up to two days for people who got two doses within a single cycle.</p><p>Vaccination wasn't linked to a change in period length, nor were menstrual changes more common with any particular vaccine.</p><p>The study's findings seem to show that the disruption of cycles was temporary, Dr. Edelman said, adding that more research was needed to confirm that. The findings raised no health concerns about vaccination, she said.</p><p>A Pfizer spokeswoman said that the company's vaccine research included tens of thousands of women and that \"abnormal menstruation or reproductive changes have not been reported as an adverse event\" in its pivotal, late-stage clinical trial. Johnson &amp; Johnson and Moderna didn't provide comment.</p><p>The new study, along with other recent research, could help ease some concerns about the shots, said Kathryn Clancy, an anthropologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who co-leads a team studying vaccine-related menstrual changes.</p><p>Fears that Covid-19 vaccines can affect fertility and reproductive health fuel vaccine hesitancy, research has shown. Multiple studies have shown that Covid-19 vaccines are generally safe and effective for women, including pregnant women, and that vaccination doesn't affect women's ability to get pregnant.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
