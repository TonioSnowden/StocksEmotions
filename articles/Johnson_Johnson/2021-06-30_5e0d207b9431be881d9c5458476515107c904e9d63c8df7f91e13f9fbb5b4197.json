  "title": "Opioid Trial Opens  In Long Island  ----  By Sara Randazzo",
  "text": "<p>   As an opioid epidemic raged across the U.S. a decade ago, employees at a major distributor of prescription drugs sent emails joking about addicts, jurors were told Tuesday during opening statements at a Long Island trial seeking to blame the pharmaceutical industry for a wave of opioid addiction. </p><p>   In one email, a corporate investigator at AmerisourceBergen Corp. circulated a song about \"Pillbillies\" set to the tune of the \"Beverly Hillbillies\" theme song, describing a man's journey to Florida to get cheap painkillers. </p><p>   \"Buy some pills. Take a load home. Y'all come back now, y'hear?\" the 2011 email ended. The next year, the same employee sent around a parody photo of a Honey Smacks cereal box, altered to say \"Killogg's Smack\" with the box's cartoon character holding a syringe. </p><p>   AmerisourceBergen is among seven companies on trial over what New York's attorney general and Nassau and Suffolk counties say is their role in causing a public-health crisis in the state. </p><p>   In the New York lawsuit and hundreds of others, the companies have pushed back on the allegations, arguing they sold pills for legitimate medical uses and distributed them according to federal regulations. Lawyers for the seven companies will give their opening remarks to jurors on Wednesday. </p><p>   AmerisourceBergen said the emails were among 12 million pages of documents turned over in the case and included content found on the internet that was forwarded to a small number of employees with jobs that included investigating online content that could indicate drug-diversion trends. </p><p>   The trial is the third under way across the country in which counties and states argue that companies in the pharmaceutical-drug supply chain flooded communities with painkillers. Around 500,000 people in the U.S. have died from opioid overdoses since 1999, according to federal data. </p><p>   The New York trial, unlike those happening in California state court and West Virginia federal court, is the first to be heard by a jury and the first to include both the makers and distributors of prescription opioids in one proceeding. </p><p>   Attorneys for New York's Suffolk and Nassau counties and the state's attorney general walked jurors through a narrative that by now has been told in more than 3,000 lawsuits nationwide. Drug companies, they say, aggressively marketed their opioids to doctors to create a wider market for painkillers beyond what was medically necessary. Wholesalers that distribute the drugs to pharmacies, the plaintiffs allege, allowed higher and higher volumes to be shipped without raising enough questions about suspicious orders. </p><p>   Their actions, said Hunter Shkolnik, an attorney for Nassau County, \"directly correlates to abuse and diversion in the communities.\" The counties and state, he said, now \"have to clean up that mess.\" </p><p>   The trial is down to seven defendants after Johnson &amp; Johnson settled with New York over the weekend for $263 million and four pharmacies were severed from the case. The remaining companies include drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Endo International PLC and drug distributors Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp. </p><p>   Because of the large number of parties involved and pandemic-related precautions, the trial is being held in an auditorium at a Long Island law school rather than in the courthouse. </p><p>   Absent from the trial is the company most often blamed for the opioid crisis, OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma LP, which filed for bankruptcy almost two years ago amid thousands of lawsuits. </p><p>   Mr. Shkolnik showed jurors an email he said was sent from Cardinal Chief Executive George Barrett in 2017 calling opioid addiction a national tragedy. </p><p>   \"Who do we blame?\" the email said. \"We all own it and it is time we acknowledge that.\" A Cardinal spokesman had no immediate comment. </p><p>    Jayne Conroy, a lawyer representing Suffolk County, told jurors plaintiffs aren't arguing that the companies are the only cause of the epidemic, but that they would be able to show why each should be held liable. </p><p>   \"Each one of them pointed the finger at everyone except themselves,\" she said. </p><p></p>",
