  "text": "<p>The New Brunswick, N.J.-based company, a bellwether for the healthcare industry because its products span several categories, logged sales of $23.31 billion -- a 27% increase year over year -- and adjusted earnings of $2.48 a share.</p><p>Wall Street analysts had forecast adjusted earnings of $2.29 a share and revenue of $22.49 billion, according to FactSet. Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson rose less than 1% on Wednesday.</p><p>J&amp;J executives expressed confidence the return to healthcare use would continue, saying they didn't expect the spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus would have an impact.</p><p>\"Our outlook for the rest of the year really remains strong for our sector regardless of what happens with emerging variants and any continued blips as it relates to Covid,\" said Jennifer Taubert, who runs J&amp;J's pharmaceuticals business.</p><p>Ashley McEvoy, J&amp;J's medical devices chief, said hospitals appear better than earlier in the pandemic at handling any surges in Covid-19 cases while keeping elective surgeries going. Yet she said some hospitals in the U.S. are beginning to delay elective procedures as Covid-19 cases mount.</p><p>The company raised its guidance for full-year performance. J&amp;J forecast sales of $93.8 billion to $94.6 billion and adjusted earnings of $9.60 to $9.70 a share, up from the maximums from its previous forecast of $91.6 billion and $9.57 a share.</p><p>J&amp;J said sales of its Covid-19 vaccine, which generated $164 million in revenue in the second quarter, would pick up during the latter parts of the year. The shot should notch $2.5 billion in revenue for the year, most of it in the fourth quarter, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said.</p><p>J&amp;J shares have remained largely unchanged over the past seven days -- hitting a low of $165.32 on Monday -- despite news involving the company.</p><p>Last week, J&amp;J said it would recall most of its Neutrogena and Aveeno spray sunscreens from U.S. stores, after detecting a potentially cancer-causing chemical, benzene, in some samples. The company has said the levels of benzene were low and not expected cause health issues, but it was recalling the aerosol sunscreen products out of an abundance of caution. Executives didn't mention the recall during the earnings call.</p><p>The company also didn't comment about the lawsuits it has been facing alleging it played a role in the opioid epidemic. States announced a $26 billion settlement with drug companies on Wednesday afternoon to resolve thousands of opioid-crisis lawsuits.</p>",
