  "title": "U.S. News:  J&J Says Second Dose of Vaccine Bolsters Immunity  ----  By Felicia Schwartz",
  "text": "<p>    Johnson &amp; Johnson said a second dose of its Covid-19 vaccine was found in a study to generate a strong immune response, justifying a booster shot. </p><p>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it expects single-dose J&amp;J vaccine recipients would need boosters but has held off on making recommendations as it awaits more data. Wednesday's findings are expected to inform the U.S. booster strategy set to begin in September, when the U.S. plans to begin offering boosters to people who received messenger-RNA vaccines. Later it is likely to expand the program to include J&amp;J's viral-vector vaccine. </p><p>   J&amp;J said researchers found antibody levels increased ninefold among people who received a second dose of its vaccine, compared with one month after they received a first dose. It didn't specify when or how many subjects received the second dose, though information posted in a government database indicates it was administered six months after the first shot. </p><p>   J&amp;J said it would submit data from two studies to a preprint server, meaning the data haven't been peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal. </p><p>   The company said researchers observed significant increases in antibody responses in participants between ages 18 and 55 and in those 65 and older who received a lower booster dose. </p><p>   J&amp;J also said a booster is needed after eight months based on interim data it reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in July, which showed strong antibody responses through eight months after immunization with the J&amp;J one-dose shot. </p><p>   The J&amp;J vaccine is authorized for emergency use in people 18 and older. Only Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE's vaccine is fully approved by the FDA for those 16 and older. Moderna Inc.'s two-shot messenger-RNA vaccine has emergency authorization for people 18 and over. </p><p>   Nearly 14 million people in the U.S. have received a single-dose J&amp;J vaccine, according to CDC data. </p><p>   \"The single-dose vaccine is still highly protective, and we know that -- that is not diminished, but now we also know that a second dose given at six months boosts immune responses substantially,\" said Dr. Dan Barouch, who contributed to the development of the J&amp;J vaccine but wasn't directly involved in the booster information shared Wednesday. He was part of the New England Journal of Medicine study showing the vaccine's protections held for eight months. </p><p>   Use of the J&amp;J shot dropped after health authorities in April temporarily paused rollout of the shots to investigate reports of a rare blood-clotting condition. </p><p>   J&amp;J added a warning to its label in July saying its vaccine is linked to a very small incidence of cases of a rare neurological disorder seen with other vaccines or viral infections. </p><p></p>",
