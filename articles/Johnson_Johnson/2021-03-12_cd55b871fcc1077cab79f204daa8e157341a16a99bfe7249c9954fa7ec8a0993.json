The US and Japan will finance production in India, while Australia will help distribute the jabs across south-east Asia.&#xa0;</p> <p>Australia, which last week was hit by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bed655ac-9285-486a-b5ad-b015284798c8\">blocking of a vaccine shipment</a> from Italy, is also considering funding its own production to reduce reliance on imports.&#xa0;</p> <p>Meanwhile in Europe, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9e5b8d8-8153-474a-bd57-97f5adbeb638\">EU vaccination plans</a> experienced another setback as Brussels said AstraZeneca was unlikely to meet its (already reduced) delivery targets and hopes of extra supplies from the US faded. Meanwhile new doubts have risen about the safety of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab across the continent, from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c30de288-b50d-4a6e-b08b-db921817d5dd#post-ba7702dc-e090-4f8b-9fe2-ce310d46e173\">Bulgaria</a> and Italy to Denmark, Norway and Iceland.</p> <p>The US, in contrast, now says it can <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfb266e4-2843-42bb-8806-765cc032b091\">offer vaccination to all adults</a> from May 1, holding out hopes that Americans may yet be able to celebrate independence day together on&#xa0;July 4. The announcement, together with what one equity chief described as “a wall of money coming like we haven't seen since the second world war” from US and EU stimulus programmes, has sparked a new wave of jitters in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47eb1683-8325-4f9a-85f9-212d54aa4d9a\">bond markets</a>.</p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p>Following the final adoption of President Joe Biden's $1.9tn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6684463d-2db2-44bd-ae97-f2b4f32133b3\"><strong>stimulus plan</strong></a>, there were also encouraging signs that the rate of US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/64b5b994-36d6-4878-ab9c-2ac02d01df0e\">job losses</a> was slowing down. Here's the tale of how Biden got his pandemic proposals through despite blanket <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c63ed896-59bf-49f3-885a-b10c9fdf06fb\">Republican opposition</a>. </p> <p>The <strong>European Central Bank</strong> on Thursday said it would speed up <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd7ccf1d-3b07-4f13-9a14-68692ef84e95\">bond purchases</a> under its €1.85tn pandemic emergency purchase programme. Christine Lagarde, ECB president, said eurozone output would probably shrink again in the first quarter but the bank was still increasing its growth forecast for the full year from 3.9 per cent to 4 per cent. </p> <p>The double whammy of Brexit and Covid-19 hit the <strong>UK economy</strong> hard in January. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55f116d8-6f3b-400a-825a-94be4d379db0\">Exports crashed</a> 40 per cent due mainly to the former while GDP shrank 2.9 per cent thanks to the latter. The UK fiscal watchdog said last week it expected the economy to return to pre-pandemic levels by the third quarter of 2022. </p> <h2>Business</h2> <p><strong>Bonuses</strong> for investment bankers at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35faa596-3f1d-40a3-9c2c-146ac9d09454\">Deutsche Bank</a> rose 46 per cent in 2020 thanks to the boom in trading fuelled by the pandemic. The bonus pool of €876m is almost eight times the size of its net profit for the year. </p> <p>Confidence among <strong>US bosses</strong> has surged thanks to the introduction of vaccines and the new stimulus package. The jump in sentiment, which the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19496e49-1d36-4929-b27c-b85539e0f4a7\">Business Roundtable</a> said had recovered much more quickly than after the 2008-2009 financial crisis, was echoed by a separate survey from the National Association of Manufacturers.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Retail gloom </strong>deepened in the UK where department store chain <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72ea7cd3-35b8-42ac-991c-c1782de2c3d6\">John Lewis</a> warned of more closures and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d28e990f-b82f-43e3-8b4f-29fbce4ebe6f\">Morrisons</a> supermarkets reported profits halving. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c30de288-b50d-4a6e-b08b-db921817d5dd#post-22a0d332-21d7-457d-a8e4-8f9ab870cd85\">Hammerson</a> said it would have to sell some of its shopping centres to survive as it reported a pre-tax loss of £1.7bn.</p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p>Many bond investors think US stimulus moves will fuel <strong>inflation</strong> but believe the rise will be limited. An economist at Pimco said there was “very little risk of the type of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b39a372-1924-4839-b931-c6773b251968\">1970s-style outcomes</a> that some economists and market participants have been alluding to.” </p> <p>Losses suffered by some big <strong>hedge fund managers</strong> illustrate the difficulties of trading in turbulent times, particularly when inflation fears rocked equity and bond markets in February. Those in the red include <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/648491b1-21b2-4d45-824b-a7817f4110d0\">Rokos Capital Management</a>, one of the world's biggest macro funds with $14.5bn in assets.</p> <p>US financial editor Robert Armstong's new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/c09e4637-8d1d-464d-a94d-66070feb271d?playlist-name=latest&amp;playlist-offset=0\">video</a> warns against excessive <strong>“reflation mania”</strong> currently engulfing markets as they envisage a jump in growth and rising prices. The forces that have driven interest rates lower over decades are unlikely to reverse because of the pent-up demand from the pandemic and government stimulus measures, he argues. Current high asset prices also make growth fragile, he adds.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/c09e4637-8d1d-464d-a94d-66070feb271d.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <h2>The essentials</h2> <p>The increased taste for personal <strong>stock market investment</strong> during the pandemic led to a flight from cash-based savings accounts. But should <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94899214-0de1-44fe-bd67-f4ba52f7c1a7\">UK investors</a> alter their strategies as we enter the Covid-19 recovery period? James Pickford from our personal finance team looks at the options.</p> <h2>Have your say</h2> <p>Reader njb2 comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd7ccf1d-3b07-4f13-9a14-68692ef84e95?commentID=80ab2f79-e69c-4c1f-8771-148a9f4c79b3\">ECB pledges to step up pace of stimulus to counter market sell-off</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“It's nice to know the ECB's mandate seems to have changed to provide the maximum possible price support for bonds and other financial assets. Income inequality will continue unabated. Pity the poor people without assets who are trying to save money to buy a house or fund their retirement. They need to save more and more money . . . and spend less and less. It's no wonder the correlation between interest rates / bond yields and consumer price inflation is negligible. There is however a very strong correlation with asset price inflation.”</p> </blockquote> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p>Non-fungible tokens? Me neither. NFTs are unique <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f28eac6-547a-43f2-b7d3-593da9f46a3d\">digital artworks</a> encrypted on blockchain to ensure authenticity and one example, a collage by artist Beeple, has just sold for $69.3m at Christie's, so it's likely you'll be hearing a lot more about them in the future. </p> <p><em>We would really like to hear from you.
