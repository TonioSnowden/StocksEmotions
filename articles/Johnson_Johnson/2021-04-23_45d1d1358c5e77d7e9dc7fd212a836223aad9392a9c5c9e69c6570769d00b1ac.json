  "title": "World Leaders Pledge Efforts On Emissions --- Developing nations at Biden climate summit ask for wealthier countries to do more",
  "text": "<p>The climate summit is aimed at jump-starting global efforts to reduce emissions as part of the Paris agreement, which calls on countries to ratchet up their climate commitments every five years. The deal relies largely on international pressure, rather than legally binding enforcement mechanisms, to persuade countries to make deep emissions cuts.</p><p>China, the No. 1 emitter and the world's No. 2 economy, said it would reduce but not eliminate coal consumption, and it called on wealthy countries like the U.S. to do more. Several other countries pledged to cut future emissions and expand their use of renewable energy.</p><p>Scientists and activists have said that without major action this decade from the U.S., China, the European Union, India and other top emitters, countries won't be able to meet the Paris agreement's goal of keeping average global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Temperature increases above that threshold could be devastating for some ecosystems and could result in rising seas that flood major cities, among other risks, according to the United Nations.</p><p>Mr. Biden used the summit to unveil a new target that calls for cutting U.S. emissions 50% to 52% from 2005 levels by 2030. The year 2005 is a common baseline for such climate targets.</p><p>In 2019, the most recent year for which complete data are available, U.S. emissions were about 13% below 2005 levels, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Emissions last year were projected to be down 21% from that 2005 baseline, due in part to a slowdown related to the pandemic. But this year, emissions are tracking higher again as the economy recovers.</p><p>\"The signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable and the cost of inaction keeps mounting,\" Mr. Biden, a Democrat, said at the summit, which featured 40 world leaders, with allies and rivals such as Russia and China among them.</p><p>Major companies, including Apple Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson and Walmart Inc., have endorsed the president's 50% target. Critics among congressional Republicans and the energy industry said Mr. Biden's plan could hurt the economy by raising the price of energy.</p><p>\"What they put out today addresses the risks of climate change, but it doesn't address the key challenge of affordable and reliable energy,\" said Mike Sommers, leader of the American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. trade group for oil-and-gas companies.</p><p>President Xi Jinping of China said at the summit that his country would reduce coal consumption starting in 2026. Mr. Xi's promise offered a peak but not an end to China's coal consumption and didn't meet the expectations of climate campaigners who were hoping for a more ambitious emissions-reduction timetable.</p><p>Instead, Mr. Xi reiterated the timetable he had already set forth for China reaching peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality -- net-zero carbon-dioxide emissions -- by 2060.</p><p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India made public a new partnership with the U.S. to expand renewable energy. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada said his country would aim for a reduction in carbon output below 2005 levels of between 40% to 45% by the end of the decade. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the U.K. was putting into legislation its intention to cut emissions by 78% from 1990 levels by 2035. That goal, made public earlier in the week, is a step up from a previous target of a 68% emissions cut by 2030.</p><p>The EU approved this week a trillion-dollar plan aimed at making the 27-country bloc climate-neutral by 2050 and improving its overall ecological performance.</p><p>China, the world's No. 1 emitter, and many developing nations said they shouldn't shoulder the same responsibilities as developed countries to combat climate change, arguing that wealthy nations were allowed to release greenhouse-gas emissions into the atmosphere unchecked for decades while they industrialized.</p><p>\"Developed countries need to increase climate ambition and action and make concrete efforts to help developing countries accelerate the transition to green and low-carbon development,\" Mr. Xi said.</p><p>Marshall Islands President David Kabua, whose country is threatened by sea-level rise, also pressed for help from wealthy nations. \"Too often, vulnerable countries hear the excuse that state emission cuts are too costly, but political signals, especially from the major economies, shape decisions on investment and innovation for low-carbon pathways,\" he said.</p><p>Many nations' leaders are skeptical of U.S. promises on climate following decades of sharp policy shifts, including President George W. Bush abandoning the 1997 Kyoto Protocol negotiated under the Bill Clinton administration and President Donald Trump withdrawing from the Paris climate deal that President Barack Obama played a central role in negotiating in 2015.</p><p>Developing nations are also pursuing billions of dollars in financial assistance to help them lower their emissions, adapt to the effects of climate change and offset the costs of limiting their reliance on fossil fuels. Mr. Biden said the U.S. would double by 2024 the annual climate-related financing it provides to developing countries.</p><p>Under a plan released by the White House, federal agencies will move toward ending U.S. government investment in foreign carbon-intensive, fossil fuel-based energy projects. And the U.S. International Development Finance Corp., an agency that helps finance projects in developing nations, will transition to a portfolio that is net-zero in emissions by 2040. The president added that the U.S. continues to support an effort to send $100 billion from rich countries to developing nations.</p><p>Mr. Biden's new emissions goal would nearly double the target set by Mr. Obama, which called for a 26% to 28% cut by 2025 from 2005 levels. The Biden administration said this week that the U.S. is on track to meet that target.</p><p>Global progress has been slow since the Paris accords went into effect. Several of its biggest advocates found it difficult to fulfill their ambitions, and within a year, China's emissions began accelerating again after a brief slowdown.</p><p>U.S. officials said they see multiple paths toward achieving their goals, through a combination of federal policies and action by states, companies and other subnational groups. Mr. Biden has proposed a $2.3 trillion infrastructure package that includes measures to reduce emissions, such as a proposed standard mandating that U.S. electricity be produced with low-carbon energy sources.</p><p>The 24-page climate plan the U.S. submitted to the U.N. on Thursday includes broad top-line options for reaching the target. A federal climate task force set up by Mr. Biden will release a more-detailed plan later this year, officials said. Final negotiations aimed at increasing national climate targets is scheduled by the U.N. for November in Glasgow.</p><p>---</p><p>Katy Stech Ferek, Sha Hua and Paulo Trevisani contributed to this article.</p>",
