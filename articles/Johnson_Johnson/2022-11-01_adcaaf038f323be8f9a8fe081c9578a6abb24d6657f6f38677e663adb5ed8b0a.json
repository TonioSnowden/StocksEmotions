  "text": "<p>* S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 rose 43.25 points, or 1.1%, to 3,926.25.</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 advanced 238 points, or 0.7%, to 33,013.</p><p>* Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00 gained 160.25 points, or 1.4%, to trade at 11,607.50.</p><p>The Dow DJIA rose 14%, last month its best such percentage gain since January 1976 and its biggest October rise on record. The S&amp;P 500 SPX gained 8% in October, while the Nasdaq Composite COMP advanced 3.9%.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>A mixed third quarter corporate earnings season continues. With 268 of S&amp;P 500 constituents having reported through Monday, 73% have delivered earnings above expectations, 5% have matched and 22% were below, according to Refinitiv data.</p><p>The numbers appear not to have been as bad as many investors feared, and this is one of the factors that helped the S&amp;P 500 record a sturdy rally last month, said analysts.</p><p>\"October proved to be a much better month for financial assets after the disastrous performance over Q3, aided by hopes of a pivot from central banks, a stabilization in Europe's energy situation, as well as an end to the U.K. market turmoil,\" said Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, in a note.</p><p>\"But we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves, as the S&amp;P 500's +8.1% gain over the month in total return terms means it's only partially recovered from its -9.2% loss in September, let alone its -23.9% loss over the first nine months of the year as a whole,\" Reid added.</p><p>Mark Newton, head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, said that Monday's mild selloff did not detract from what had been a \"stellar month\" for the market. \"The combination of negative sentiment, bullish midterm seasonality and some positive cycles gave plenty of warnings that October might live up to its billing as a 'Bear-Killer' month.\"</p><p>But he warned: \"The question remains, will the Fed spook investors on Wednesday, or deliver a warm 'trick or treat' dovish surprise that could help this rally to extend further?\"</p><p>See: What Fed Chair Powell can say to keep the stock-market rally going — or kill it</p><p>The Fed is expected to raise rates by 75 basis points to a range of 3.75% to 4% when it concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday.</p><p>Read: Another jumbo Fed rate hike is expected this week — and then life gets difficult for Powell</p><p>Economic data for it to consider before then include on Tuesday the S&amp;P U.S. manufacturing PMI for October, due at 9:45 a.m. and the ISM manufacturing index for October at 10 a.m. The jobs openings reports will also be published at 10 a.m. All times Eastern.</p><p>Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said it would be sensible for traders to adopt a cautious stance given the market's latest rally left it vulnerable to a more hawkish-than-expected outcome from the U.S. central bank. \"Investors are wisely pausing for thought [on Monday] ahead of what is expected to be another jumbo Fed rate hike while attempting to plot a Fed rate hike path well into 2023.\"</p><p>Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, fretted that investors were being too simplistic in their hopes for a dovish tone from the Fed this week. \"The risk is, because investors are waiting in ambush for the Fed to soften its tone, any sign of a less hawkish Fed could send both the bond and equity markets rallying.\"</p><p>\"And that's exactly what the Fed doesn't want to happen. A broadly cheerful market rally would boost inflation expectations, and inflation. And inflation is nowhere close to the Fed's 2% policy target,\" said Ozkardeskaya.</p><p>American depositary receipts of Chinese companies, including e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, Chinese internet names iQiyi Inc. IQ, Bilibili Inc. BILI, Huya Inc. HUYA , JD.com Inc. JD jumped in premarket trade.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Hong Kong stocks appeared to rally in response to an anonymous post on Chinese social media suggested that the government may intend to soften pandemic-related restrictions beginning in March. Other outlets also reported on the rumor.</p><p>A spokesman for China's foreign ministry told reporters he was \"not aware of the situation you mentioned,\" when asked about the social media posts, news reports said.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Shares of Abiomed Inc. ABMD jumped 48.8% toward a 14-month high in premarket trading Tuesday, after the provider of medical technology that supports circulation and oxygenation agreed to acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ in a deal valued at $16.6 billion.</p><p>* Uber Technologies Inc. UBER shares jumped after the ride-hailing giant topped revenue expectations and gave an upbeat outlook for the current quarter.</p><p>Dow futures climb as traders jostle for position before Fed decision</p>",
