  "title": "U.S. News:  J&J to Control  Vaccine Plant  After Problem  ----  By Peter Loftus and Alex Leary",
  "text": "<p>   Johnson &amp; Johnson is taking over manufacturing of its Covid-19 vaccine at a contract manufacturer's plant that makes the main ingredient, after a production problem ruined a batch. </p><p>   In order to give J&amp;J full control, production of AstraZeneca PLC's vaccine at the Emergent BioSolutions Inc. plant in Baltimore will move elsewhere, according to a person familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The moves, which the person said were facilitated by the Biden administration and which were confirmed by the companies, mark a rapid response to the recent discovery of the contaminated batch. The New York Times earlier reported J&amp;J's takeover of the plant. </p><p>   The Emergent plant hadn't yet been cleared by regulators when J&amp;J discovered the quality problem during a routine inspection, and none of the batch had been shipped for use to make vaccines. </p><p>   Yet J&amp;J and U.S. health authorities have looked forward to the plant coming online and producing the key ingredient to bolster the overall supply of vaccine doses. </p><p>   Under the changes, J&amp;J is assuming full responsibility for operations and manufacturing of its vaccine's key ingredient at the Emergent plant, including installing a new leadership team and boosting the number of technical, quality and other workers. </p><p>   J&amp;J continues to work through manufacturing issues with the Food and Drug Administration, and no product will come out of the Baltimore facility without authorization by the FDA, the person said. </p><p>   J&amp;J said it is working with the FDA to secure authorization of the plant, which would clear the way for doses containing the ingredient made at the plant to be distributed. </p><p>   The federal government worked with AstraZeneca to move production of its vaccine out of the plant so it could focus exclusively on making J&amp;J's vaccine, the person familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   AstraZeneca said it is working with the U.S. government to find another plant to make the main ingredient for the company's vaccine. </p><p>   Emergent is committed to supporting production of the Covid-19 vaccines, and it will still control the facility and work with J&amp;J to add its personnel to the plant's staff, an Emergent spokesman said. </p><p>   The Emergent plant was supposed to play an important role in Covid-19 vaccine production, making the main ingredients for the J&amp;J and AstraZeneca shots. </p><p>   AstraZeneca's vaccine hasn't been authorized for U.S. use, though the company said it is preparing a submission. </p><p>    The FDA has been investigating what caused the quality lapse at the Baltimore plant. </p><p>   J&amp;J has said the failed batch of the vaccine's main ingredient at the Emergent plant never advanced to the vial-filling stage, and no doses were distributed from the batch. </p><p>   J&amp;J has said the problem didn't affect doses distributed since the vaccine was authorized for U.S. use in late February. </p><p>   For doses already distributed, J&amp;J has made the main ingredient at its own plant in the Netherlands. </p><p></p>",
