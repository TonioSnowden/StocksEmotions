  "text": "<p>   The federal government and Emergent BioSolutions Inc. terminated a pandemic-preparedness contract after the contract drug manufacturer experienced problems manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines. </p><p>   Emergent, based in Gaithersburg, Md., said the termination reduced the total value of its contract to $470.9 million from $650.8 million. </p><p>   A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services division initially awarded Emergent a contract in 2012 to complete construction of a manufacturing plant in Baltimore that would make drugs and vaccines to be used in a pandemic or other public-health emergency. </p><p>   The contract was issued under a program called the Centers for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing, or CIADM. The contract's initial term was eight years, with options to extend the pact to 25 years. </p><p>   When the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020, the U.S. government reserved capacity at Emergent for the manufacture of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments. </p><p>   But Emergent encountered contamination problems at the Baltimore plant that ruined batches of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Johnson &amp; Johnson earlier this year, constraining the initial supply of doses. </p><p>   Emergent shares dropped 37%, or $19.50, to $33.11 in trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. </p><p></p>",
