  "text": "<p>\"We are seeing procedures recovering,\" Ashley McEvoy, J&amp;J's worldwide chair of its MedTech business, told investors during this week's earnings call. \"In the United States, we started to see surgical procedures tick up, predominantly at the latter part of the quarter.\"</p><p>Over the course of the pandemic, surgical volumes declined as hospitals postponed or canceled elective procedures during COVID-19 surges and patients held off on medical care. One study published in JAMA Network Open in August found the recovery in surgical volume at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston was inconsistent and insufficient through much of 2021. But that's starting to change. Google searches for elective procedures made during the week of Oct. 9 were 108% higher than pre-pandemic levels, Needham analysts said this month.</p><p>\"There is patient demand that is still yet to be met,\" McEvoy said. \"And that's really what we're experiencing in quarter three, and we still think that will continue into 2023.\"</p><p>Abbott Laboratories ABT, which makes heart pumps and pacemakers, among other cardiac devices, also said this week that cardiovascular procedure volumes in the U.S. were soft in July but strengthened in August and September.</p><p>The better-than-expected performance in J&amp;J's med-tech business in the third quarter has Stifel analysts \"feeling cautiously optimistic\" about Stryker and Zimmer, both of which make devices used in orthopedic procedures. The companies are set to share quarterly results on Oct. 31 and Nov. 2, respectively.</p><p>J&amp;J's stock is down 3.6% this year, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX has declined 22.4%.</p><p>Patients are getting surgeries again, says J&amp;J</p>",
