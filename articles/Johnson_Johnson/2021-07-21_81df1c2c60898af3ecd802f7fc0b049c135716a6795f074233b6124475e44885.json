  "title": "U.S. News: New York Reaches $1.2 Billion Deal With Drug Distributors on Opioids",
  "text": "<p>\"While no amount of money will ever compensate for the millions of addictions, the hundreds of thousands of deaths, or the countless communities decimated by opioids, this money will be vital in preventing any future devastation,\" Ms. James said.</p><p>The New York deal was announced as negotiators complete the outlines of a $26 billion deal between states and the three distributors and Johnson &amp; Johnson. That deal would open a path to ending more than four years of litigation over drug distributors' and pharmaceutical companies' liability for an opioid-addiction epidemic that federal data shows killed nearly half a million people in the U.S. from 1999 to 2019.</p><p>AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal and McKesson said jointly Tuesday that the New York settlement is an \"important step\" toward completing the broader deal. While they dispute the allegations against them at the trial, \"they believe this resolution will allow the companies to focus their attention and resources on the safe and secure delivery of medications and therapies while delivering meaningful relief to affected communities,\" the companies said.</p><p>Tuesday's settlement with New York represents an acceleration of what the state would have received in the $26 billion deal.</p><p>Plaintiffs' lawyers representing thousands of local governments and some states said Tuesday on a media call that negotiations continue around the clock to complete the terms of the national deal. The settlement would include money doled out over more than a decade, as well as the creation of a clearinghouse to help the distributors spot and halt suspicious drug orders.</p><p>\"We're hopeful we're in the very, very final stages,\" said Paul Geller, a Florida lawyer who represents several cities and counties and has helped lead the talks. \"We're dealing with the most complex constellation of cases that we've ever seen. . .We're all agonizing over every sentence, every comma.\"</p><p>A bipartisan group of 10 state attorneys general, including those from Ohio, North Carolina and Massachusetts, said Tuesday: \"Our negotiations are progressing well and potentially nearing their completion.\"</p>",
