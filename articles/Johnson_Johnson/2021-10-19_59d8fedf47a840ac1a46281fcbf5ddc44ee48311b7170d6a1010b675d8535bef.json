  "title": "J&J Used Lenient Bankruptcy Rules to Push Talc Liabilities to Charlotte; Consumer goods giant put talc liabilities in bankruptcy court far from New Jersey headquarters",
  "text": "<p>J&amp;J formed a new Texas subsidiary to carry its talc liabilities, then converted that entity to a North Carolina-based company days before it filed for bankruptcy. The chapter 11 filing last week effectively shifts to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Charlotte, N.C., the fate of nearly 40,000 pending lawsuits alleging talc used in Johnson's Baby Powder caused ovarian cancer, asbestos poisoning and other illnesses.</p><p>\"Further manipulation of the venue statute by creating entities for the sole purpose of filing in a particular jurisdiction does push this to an extreme that is likely to undermine faith in the bankruptcy system,\" said Stephen Lubben, a professor at Seton Hall University School of Law.</p><p>Congress is considering making forum selection rules more restrictive. The rules have long been flexible in allowing companies their preferred location for filing for bankruptcy protection. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and John Cornyn (R-Texas) reintroduced legislation last month that would require corporations or wealthy individuals to file chapter 11 either in their home state or where they have significant assets.</p><p>Congressional Democrats criticized J&amp;J's decision to put its talc claims into chapter 11, describing it as an abuse of the bankruptcy system. J&amp;J has said bankruptcy provides a forum to fairly compensate claimants, and likely quicker than through the traditional trial system. The company has defeated some lawsuits, lost others and maintained that its baby powder is safe.</p><p>A bankruptcy stay is likely to give J&amp;J new leverage against injury claimants in talc litigation, starting a chapter 11 process that the company can afford to continue funding for years, said Georgetown Law Professor Adam Levitin, who is providing consulting advice to some talc claimants.</p><p>J&amp;J's subsidiary in chapter 11, LTL Management LLC, said in a Monday filing that J&amp;J should be protected from ongoing talc lawsuits even though it isn't in bankruptcy itself. A hearing on that request is scheduled for Wednesday.</p><p>Allowing troubled companies to choose where to file for chapter 11 protection has been debated for decades. Supporters of the current system contend allowing companies to file in traditionally busy venues like Delaware and New York benefits all parties because those courts are most experienced in complex corporate restructuring. In recent years, bankruptcy courts in North Carolina have presided over large bankruptcies involving asbestos liabilities.</p><p>Since 2017, Koch Industries Inc.'s Georgia-Pacific LLC, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain SA's CertainTeed LLC and U.S. units of Ireland's Trane Technologies PLC have all hived off asbestos liabilities into new entities that then filed for chapter 11 protection in Charlotte. They are represented by Jones Day, the same law firm representing LTL Management.</p><p>Bipartisan legislation by Sens. Warren and Cornyn that would reform the bankruptcy venue system was first introduced in 2018. Sen. Warren also introduced a bill over the summer that would allow parties to dismiss a bankruptcy if it was filed after the type of Texas reorganization J&amp;J used to shift its talc liabilities away from the rest of its business.</p><p>Lynn LoPucki, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the proposed legislation would be a critical first step to reforming the bankruptcy system. A longtime critic of current venue rules, he says they encourage judges to compete for large cases, compromising the integrity of the bankruptcy system. Many lawyers and judges disagree.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported last year that some troubled companies incorporated subsidiaries or rented short-term office space in a White Plains, N.Y. office building to ensure their chapter 11 cases were heard by a particular bankruptcy judge.</p><p>J&amp;J's subsidiary has accused personal-injury lawyers of forum-shopping in talc cases, saying in court papers last week that law firms strategically placed advertising in markets where complaints have been brought, including Missouri.</p><p>LTL Management referenced a 2018 trial in St. Louis involving 20 women and their estates who were ultimately awarded a more than $2 billion judgment. Most of the women \"had no meaningful connection to Missouri\" and didn't live or purchase J&amp;J products there, the company subsidiary said.</p><p>J&amp;J's defense costs for talc lawsuits have totaled about $1 billion, with settlements and verdicts related to talc costing another $3.5 billion, according to court papers.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p>",
