  "title": "Who Is Ghislaine Maxwell? Jeffrey Epstein's Alleged Accomplice on Trial for Sex Trafficking; Opening statements in the trial of the British socialite began Monday, Nov. 29",
  "text": "<p>Ms. Maxwell has pleaded not guilty. Her lawyers have argued she is a scapegoat for Epstein, who died in his jail cell in August 2019, about a month after his indictment on sex-trafficking charges. The medical examiner ruled his death a suicide.</p><p>Who is Ghislaine Maxwell?</p><p>Ms. Maxwell is a British socialite, the Oxford University-educated daughter of Robert Maxwell, a billionaire publisher and former member of the U.K. Parliament. Her father died in 1991 after falling off his yacht, which was named the \"Lady Ghislaine.\" Ms. Maxwell met Epstein in the early 1990s and was his girlfriend for several years while also consulting on his properties and helping to decorate them. They continued to be friends after the relationship ended and served as a caretaker to his real estate properties across the U.S. and in Paris.</p><p>Prosecutors describe Epstein and Ms. Maxwell as \"partners in crime.\" They allege that from at least 1994 through 2004, Ms. Maxwell recruited and abused underage girls with Epstein in locations including New York, Florida and New Mexico. They said she befriended girls by taking them shopping or to the movies and asking about their lives.</p><p>Ms. Maxwell's lawyers say she is a scapegoat who was only indicted after Epstein died by suicide in a jail cell in 2019 while awaiting charges that he trafficked and sexually abused underage girls. Ms. Maxwell has been wrongfully labeled a \"rich girl,\" her lawyers say. In reality, they say, she has worked her entire adult life. She speaks several languages and can pilot a helicopter, according to her lawyers.</p><p>What's the latest in the trial?</p><p>A woman testified at Ms. Maxwell's sex-trafficking trial Tuesday that Ms. Maxwell, despite knowing she was underage, set up many of the more than 100 sexual massages she gave to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>Speaking softly and occasionally stopping to wipe away tears, the woman said that starting when she was 14, she would massage Epstein in a bathroom in his Palm Beach, Fla., home, while in her underwear or naked. The massages would last for 45 minutes before he would start to masturbate while groping her breasts and buttocks, she said.</p><p>Ms. Maxwell would call her to set up the massages during the first year of her visits, said the woman, who testified only by her first name, Carolyn. At one point, Ms. Maxwell invited her to travel with Epstein, including to an island, Carolyn said. She didn't go.</p><p>\"I told her that I was too young and there was no way in hell my mom would let me,\" she said. Her testimony, in a federal court in New York, came during the second week of the trial. She was the third accuser to take the stand at the trial to talk about Ms. Maxwell's role in recruiting and grooming them as teens for sexual massages with Epstein.</p><p>What was Ms. Maxwell's connection to Jeffrey Epstein?</p><p>Epstein was involved in the finances for rich and powerful individuals over four decades. Among them were retail magnate Leslie Wexner, financier Leon Black, Johnson &amp; Johnson heiress Elizabeth Johnson and hedge-fund billionaire Glenn Dubin.</p><p>In a 2009 deposition, a former house manager for Epstein testified that Ms. Maxwell was his \"main girlfriend\" starting around 1992.</p><p>Epstein in 1995 renamed a company he had in Palm Beach, Fla., to Ghislaine Corp., which was dissolved in 1998, according to Florida state records. Epstein called Ms. Maxwell his best friend in a 2003 interview with Vanity Fair.</p><p>In depositions taken in 2009 and 2010 as part of civil lawsuits against Epstein, household employees said Ms. Maxwell was a central figure in Epstein's private life. Several said Ms. Maxwell hired, supervised and fired household staff, while directing the visits of dozens of \"massage therapists\"â€”typically young women.</p><p>How long is the trial expected to last?</p><p>The trial is expected to run for six weeks. Opening statements began Monday, Nov. 29.</p><p>What accusations does Ms. Maxwell face?</p><p>Ms. Maxwell, 59 years old, faces six criminal counts at trial including enticing a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts and transporting a minor with the intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. The trial is expected to include testimony from her accusers.</p><p>She also faces two perjury charges, which will be the subject of a separate trial.</p><p>\"I have not committed any crime,\" Ms. Maxwell said at a court hearing earlier in November.</p><p>Prosecutors said Epstein worked with others to create a pipeline of young girls for sexual activities. Ms. Maxwell has been accused by multiple women in affidavits and court filings of recruiting young women for Epstein and training them for sex.</p><p>While Epstein had been charged with the abuse of young girls between 2002 and 2005, the indictment against Ms. Maxwell spans 1994 and 1997.</p><p>\"This case is the prequel to the earlier case that we brought against Jeffrey Epstein,\" then-acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said at a news conference last year.</p><p>Ms. Maxwell played a \"critical role\" in finding and grooming victims, and sometimes participated in the sexual abuse, Ms. Strauss said at the time.</p><p>How is Prince Andrew involved?</p><p>An accuser of convicted sex offender Epstein filed a lawsuit against the U.K.'s Prince Andrew alleging the British royal sexually abused her multiple times when she was under 18 years old.</p><p>In her lawsuit, Virginia Giuffre accuses Prince Andrew of raping and sexually abusing her while she was a minor and a sex-trafficking victim. The abuse created severe and lasting damage for Ms. Giuffre, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and seeks compensatory and punitive damages.</p><p>Prince Andrew, the second-oldest son of Queen Elizabeth II, has previously denied Ms. Giuffre's accusations. In a 2019 interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Prince Andrew said he couldn't recall meeting Ms. Giuffre. Days after the interview aired, he said he would step back from public duties as a member of the royal family.</p><p>\"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein,\" Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, said in a 2019 statement.</p><p>How many years in prison does she face?</p><p>Ms. Maxwell faces a maximum of 40 years in prison on the most serious count, conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. If convicted, her sentence would ultimately be determined by the judge.</p><p>Will the trial be televised?</p><p>No. Federal courts generally don't allow cameras in the courtroom.</p><p>Write to Anthony DeRosa at anthony.derosa@wsj.com and Corinne Ramey at corinne.ramey@wsj.com</p><p>Who Is Ghislaine Maxwell?
