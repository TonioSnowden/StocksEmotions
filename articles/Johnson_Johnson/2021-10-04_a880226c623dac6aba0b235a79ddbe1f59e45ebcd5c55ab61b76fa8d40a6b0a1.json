  "text": "<p>Manufacturers around the globe are now churning out around 1.5 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines a month and are on track to produce a total of 12 billion doses by the end of the year, according to the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations. By June, total production of Covid-19 vaccines will have doubled to 24 billion doses, according to the lobbying group.</p><p>That is more than twice the 11 billion doses the World Health Organization says are needed to vaccinate 70% of the global population with a two-dose regimen. World leaders at a summit hosted by President Biden in September said they aim to hit that target in every nation by next September.</p><p>Despite the seemingly encouraging numbers, public-health officials, activists and supply-chain experts are warning that many poor countries are still struggling to secure doses even for their most at-risk citizens.</p><p>So far, rich countries have delivered some 10% of the around 1.7 billion doses they have pledged to share with low- and lower-middle-income countries by next September, according to figures derived from Our World in Data, a project based at the University of Oxford.</p><p>That has prompted calls for vaccine makers and governments to release more information on how many vaccines they expect and when, and concern that, when shortages arise, manufacturers are giving priority to supplies to high-income countries, which usually pay more.</p><p>\"Either manufacturers are making [vaccine] and. . .hiding it under a bush. Or [they are] selling it to someone else who's hiding it under a bush,\" said Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"And if [they are] not making a billion and a half [doses], tell us.\"</p><p>Currently, 2.3% of people in low-income countries have received their first Covid-19 shot, according to Our World in Data. An interim target set by the WHO of vaccinating at least 40% of the populations in developing nations by the end of 2021 currently looks out of reach for many.</p><p>In September, Covax, the WHO-backed program meant to provide shots to developing nations, slashed its delivery forecast for this year by one-fourth, citing delayed shipments from several vaccine makers, including Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca PLC.</p><p>A spokeswoman for AstraZeneca said the company still planned to produce 170 million doses for Covax this year, in line with its original commitment. Some doses released near the end of the year may not arrive at their destination countries until early 2022. A J&amp;J spokesman said the company was committed to providing vaccines to Covax and developingcountries.</p><p>Rich countries are in line for big stock surpluses, even if they, like the U.S., roll out booster shots to seniors and other at-risk citizens -- and vaccinate children.</p><p>Data company Airfinity says that, based on its analysis of expected vaccine supplies, some of the richest Western economies -- the U.S., European Union, U.K. and Canada -- will have around 600 million doses left over by the end of the year. That surplus stock would build up to around 900 million doses by mid-2022 -- enough, according to Airfinity, to fill the gap to the 70% vaccination target in low- and lower-middle-income countries by June.</p><p>\"I'm confident that high-income countries can share much more than they are right now,\" said Krishna Udayakumar, founding director of the Duke Global Health Innovation Center.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
