  "text": "<p>Employers are invited to participate in the search to find <a href=\"https://www.vitality.co.uk/business/healthiest-workplace/\">Britain's healthiest workplace</a> — through a survey designed to identify the physical and mental condition of staff, the links to productivity, and the best practices for improved wellbeing.</p> <p>The study, founded by Vitality and backed by the Financial Times along with Rand Europe, the University of Cambridge and Aon, will explore the effects of the pandemic and broader factors influencing the health of employees.</p> <p>Participation is free, and will help employers and employees alike to improve wellbeing and boost staff retention. Any organisation in the UK with 20 or more employees can take part through a simple <a href=\"https://www.vitality.co.uk/business/healthiest-workplace/\">registration process</a>, and winners in different categories, based on size, will be announced in November.</p> <p>Since 2012, some 520 organisations and 185,000 employees have participated in this survey in the UK, which has identified a substantial loss of productive working time because of both absenteeism and presenteeism linked to ill health.</p> <p>Previous rounds of the study (which was suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic) have highlighted the disproportionate burden of physical and mental ill-health on young people, women and those on low incomes; and the stress connected to financial worries, poor diets and insufficient sleep.</p> <p>The last round of winners in 2019 recognised policies adopted by groups including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Adidas, Nomura and the Wrightington Wigan &amp; Leigh NHS Foundation Trust.</p> <p>Employers wishing to take part this year can register on <a href=\"https://www.vitality.co.uk/business/healthiest-workplace/\">the survey website</a>, and will then receive a customisable questionnaire link to send to their employees for completion by September 30. </p> <p>Participants will receive a report on their health and tips on how to improve it, while employers will receive an anonymised analysis of their workforce's health, engagement and performance.</p> <p>The data is overseen by an independent advisory panel chaired by Dame Carol Black, an adviser to successive UK governments on work and health, and comprising other experts including Professor Dame Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, and Professor Andrew Curran, chief scientific adviser and director of research at the Health and Safety Executive.</p> <p>Participating employers will receive Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum status, depending on the health of their staff, as well as benchmarking information to compare with other organisations in the same industry.</p> <p>The FT will publish a series of articles about trends and practices in workplace health over the coming months to accompany the&#xa0;survey, culminating in a report in November, analysing the trends and profiling the best employers.</p> <p>Previous editions of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/health-at-work\">report</a> have covered trends in different public, private and non-profit sectors in the UK and elsewhere around the world, as well as topics such as workplace design, and the importance of trust and flexibility in boosting employees' mental health, motivation and output.</p><p>Source: Andrew Jack 2022 'Help us find Britain's healthiest workplace' FT.com 30 March.
