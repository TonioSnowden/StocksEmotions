  "text": "<p>The US has left its main military base in Afghanistan, part of an accelerated withdrawal that has led to a resurgent Taliban gaining territory and concerns that the country could descend into chaos.</p> <p>The Afghan military is set to take over Bagram Airfield, the vast US base that was once the centre of nationwide command and a sprawling symbol of the country's “forever war”. The closure of the base, announced on Friday, means most US troops have left the country. </p> <p>About 600 troops will stay behind to protect the US diplomatic mission, changing Washington's role to providing financial and logistical support to Afghanistan from outside the country.<br><br>The Pentagon expects to meet its complete withdrawal date of September 11, two decades after US President George W Bush vowed to defeat the Taliban and al-Qaeda. </p> <p>Most European countries have already withdrawn their troops, with Germany, Italy and Poland announcing last week that their troops had returned home.</p> <p>The US military exit comes as security situation has worsened in the country and the Taliban have launched waves of offensives, against Afghanistan forces and civilians. </p> <p>Peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government that began in September have failed to lead to a political settlement or ceasefire. </p> <p>General Austin S Miller, the US military commander in Afghanistan, warned the country could descend into a worsening civil war in a rare press conference last week.</p> <p>Eighty out of Afghanistan's approximately 400 districts have fallen to Taliban control since May, said Mir Haider Afzaly, an MP and chair of the Afghan parliament's defence commission.<br><br>“The violence and the battle has intensified in recent months,” he said. “We need the foreign troop support especially in the field of aviation and intelligence.” </p> <p>US president Joe Biden pledged support for Afghanistan after meeting President Ashraf Ghani at the White House last month. </p> <p>Ghani has requested $3.3bn in security assistance and 3m doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccine. The country has been hit by a surge of infections driven by the Delta variant. </p> <p>“The biggest practical measure of US support is going to be financial — they pay the entire budget of the armed forces and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future,” said Andrew Watkins, senior analyst at International Crisis Group, a non-profit organisation. </p> <p>“But their support is also political and psychological; the morale of the Afghan forces depends on feeling like their Air Force, their supply lines, their paychecks are all reliably maintained by that US support.”</p> <p>The US Central Command has as of the end of June handed over six facilities to the Afghan Ministry of Defence and shipped the equivalent 800 C-17 loads of material out of the country.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/7d024732-525b-4553-9f27-128391dcf114.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Stephanie Findlay in New Delhi  2021 'Most US troops now out of Afghanistan after main base closes ' FT.com 3 July.
