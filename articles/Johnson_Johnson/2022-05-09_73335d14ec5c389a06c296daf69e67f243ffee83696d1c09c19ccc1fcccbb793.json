  "title": "Covid-19 Cases Rise in Parts of U.S. With High Vaccination Rates; New England, Puerto Rico also have rising hospitalization after faring better than much of the country previously",
  "text": "<p>Some of these places, including Puerto Rico and Vermont, have below-average rates of prior infections, recent CDC data show. Epidemiologists and health officials believe immunity from vaccines and heavy exposure to the virus at the national level may be limiting severe illness from the latest subvariants. The New England region and Puerto Rico have among the highest vaccination rates in the U.S.</p><p>\"This is starting to affect our ability to care for individuals outside of Covid,\" said James Jarvis, senior physician executive of incident command at Northern Light Health, a system in Maine with 10 hospitals. When beds fill up at bigger facilities, it makes it harder to take in transfers from the large, rural region the system covers, he said.</p><p>State data recently showed 205 hospitalized Covid-19 patients in Maine, more than double the number in mid-April, though still less than half the peaks hit during the Omicron surge in January. Dr. Jarvis also said few patients have been requiring intensive care, indicating milder cases.</p><p>Yet the uptick demonstrates the continuing challenge of fending off the coronavirus more than two years into the pandemic, particularly as highly contagious subvariants are spreading in the U.S.</p><p>The northeastern U.S. has been hit hard by the Omicron BA.2 subvariant. The even more transmissible BA.2.12.1 version was first identified in upstate New York.</p><p>Mark Levine, Vermont's health commissioner, said it may be contributing to rising cases in a state that shares its western border with New York.</p><p>Nationally, Johns Hopkins University data show the seven-day moving average for new Covid-19 cases recently topped 73,000, up from near 27,000 a month earlier, though authorities acknowledge case counts are widely missing at-home test results. The average number of hospitalized patients with confirmed Covid-19, about 14,500, is up 44% from a mid-April low, according to federal data. Hospitalizations, a lagging indicator, also reflect patients who are being treated for other reasons and test positive after they are admitted. These numbers are far below Omicron-surge peaks in January.</p><p>The fact most Vermonters appear not to have been infected before may be contributing to recent case and hospitalization increases, said Dr. Levine, who credited efforts in the state to limit the virus. The CDC estimates 29% of Vermont's population had detectable, infection-induced antibodies by February compared with about 58% nationally. Vermont has 81% of its population fully vaccinated, compared with 66% nationally, and one of the lowest Covid-19 mortality rates.</p><p>Nationally, epidemiologists believe heavy exposure to the virus during the record-breaking Omicron surge this winter may have boosted immune defenses and blunted the impact of the latest virus versions. But higher exposure to the virus isn't a guarantee of protection. The CDC estimates nearly 62% of New Yorkers exhibited signs of previous infection as of February.</p><p>Dr. Levine said chilly spring weather that has kept people inside likely played a role in rising cases and hospitalizations in the state. However, Timothy Lahey, an infectious disease physician at University of Vermont Medical Center, said hospitalizations in UVM's larger network have recently plateaued.</p><p>In Puerto Rico, BA.2.12.1 makes up a significant and rising number of infections, said Dr. Iris Cardona, chief medical officer at the Puerto Rico Department of Health. Known Covid-19 cases as of Saturday reached 950 per 100,000 in the prior week—higher than any state—and the test positivity rate hit 25%, according to CDC and local data. Hospitalizations recently climbed to 281 people, the highest since early February.</p><p>About 83% of Puerto Rico's population is fully vaccinated, higher than any state, CDC data show. The agency considers people fully vaccinated once they have received two shots of an mRNA vaccine or the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.</p><p>One possible factor is that Puerto Rico was one of the earliest places to vaccinate a large proportion of the population, creating more time for immunity from the shots to wane, said Kenira Thompson, president of the Scientific Coalition, which advises the governor on Covid-19 policy.</p><p>The island, like much of the country, also hasn't been as successful in persuading residents to get booster shots. Among those fully vaccinated, 58% have received a first booster dose, versus 46% nationally, according to the CDC.</p><p>\"Thankfully we don't have any of our hospital systems that are compromised, but it's always something that worries us,\" Dr. Thompson said.</p><p>Write to Jon Kamp at jon.kamp@wsj.com and Arian Campo-Flores at arian.campo-flores@wsj.com</p><p>Covid-19 Cases Rise in Parts of U.S. With High Vaccination Rates</p>",
