  "text": "<p>The bankruptcy filing confirms the fears of injury lawyers, who had voiced worries that J&amp;J would put talc claims into chapter 11 to stop jury verdicts, protect assets and pressure plaintiffs to accept settlements.</p><p>\"We are taking these actions to bring certainty to all parties involved in the cosmetic talc cases,\" said Michael Ullmann, J&amp;J's executive vice president and general counsel.</p><p>As of July, the company faced roughly 34,600 lawsuits linking its talc-based baby powder to ovarian cancer, asbestos cancer and other illnesses. J&amp;J has said its talcum powder, which it stopped selling last year, is safe and doesn't cause cancer, and that numerous tests over the past 40 years didn't show a presence of asbestos.</p><p>J&amp;J, which hasn't filed for bankruptcy, said Thursday that it is providing financial backing for a settlement with injury victims.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Places Talc Injury Claims in Bankruptcy</p>",
