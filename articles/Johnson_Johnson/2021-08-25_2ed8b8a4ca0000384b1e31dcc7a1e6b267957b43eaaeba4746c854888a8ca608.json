  "title": "J&J Injury Claimants Struggle Against Possible Talc Bankruptcy; More talc-injury claimants try to prohibit J&J from possibly sweeping personal-injury liabilities into chapter 11",
  "text": "<p>J&amp;J declined to comment on the Missouri request, which escalates a confrontation between injury claimants and the company about its intentions for dealing with roughly 34,600 lawsuits pending against it as of June alleging personal injuries from talc.</p><p>Also on Tuesday, a bankruptcy judge in Wilmington, Del. deferred ruling on a separate request by other injury claimants to pre-empt J&amp;J from separating its talc liabilities from its core business, a potential first step toward moving thousands of injury claims into chapter 11.</p><p>A Texas statute allows for separating corporate assets from liabilities through what are known as divisive or divisional mergers. They have been used by several businesses facing large numbers of asbestos claims to silo those liabilities in newly formed units that can be placed into chapter 11.</p><p>J&amp;J said in private negotiations over talc claims it is considering isolating its talc liabilities before placing them in bankruptcy, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. J&amp;J itself could receive the benefit of the litigation stay even if only an affiliate files for chapter 11, according to legal experts. Bankruptcy filings generally halt tort cases and discovery proceedings, creating a single forum for companies beset with large liabilities to negotiate a restructuring.</p><p>Injury claimants told the Missouri court that shifting their claims from state court into chapter 11 proceedings would put them at a disadvantage in settlement talks and give J&amp;J years of protection from jury trials.</p><p>J&amp;J hasn't disclosed any strategy regarding the talc lawsuits other than to defend the safety of its products in pending cases. But the company hasn't denied that using a divisive merger is a possibility, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein said at Tuesday's hearing.</p><p>Talc claimants have asked her to restrain J&amp;J from executing a divisive merger, on the theory that doing so would harm the reorganization efforts of another company, Imerys Talc America Inc., which mined and supplied talc for J&amp;J for decades.</p><p>Targeted alongside J&amp;J in talc litigation, Imerys filed for chapter 11 protection in 2019 and has proposed a bankruptcy plan that would resolve its share of liability on thousands of talc claims. The biggest assets available to Imerys are its rights to indemnification, or reimbursement, from J&amp;J for the injury claims, claimant lawyer Natalie Ramsey said at the bankruptcy court hearing.</p><p>Ms. Ramsey said isolating J&amp;J's talc liabilities through a divisive merger would hinder the ability of Imerys to collect on those property rights and force it to collect only from a bankrupt entity with limited assets, rather than from J&amp;J, \"a very solvent, wealthy corporation.\"</p><p>Judge Silverstein questioned whether injury claimants have legal standing to make their request because the indemnification rights at issue belong to Imerys, rather than to individual creditors.</p><p>J&amp;J denies it owes any such indemnification. The company's lawyer Theodore Tsekerides said Tuesday that while he isn't privy to J&amp;J's plans for dealing with talc claims, the company shouldn't be restrained from executing a divisive merger. The bankruptcy court shouldn't prejudge how the rights of J&amp;J's contract counterparty, Imerys, would be affected, he said.</p><p>J&amp;J has said in court filings that restraining it as the claimants have requested would hijack its corporate governance based on hypothetical harm and speculation.</p><p>The company agreed to a temporary standstill last month pending a ruling by Judge Silverstein, who said Tuesday the dispute was an issue of first impression that she would need time to resolve.</p><p>Write to Becky Yerak at becky.yerak@wsj.com and Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com</p>",
