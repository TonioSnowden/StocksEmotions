  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>one of Royal Dutch Shell's biggest shareholders <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/51b6ddd3-cbbf-46ae-abdf-c1f5c1945e37\">has dismissed </a>the activist hedge fund Third Point's proposal to split the oil major into separate companies, saying it would be too complicated and unlikely to add value for long-term investors.</p> <h2>When standing up to Wall Street pays off big</h2> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-palm-beach-island-to-ask-120-million-35-million-more-than-it-sold-for-in-july-11631214993\">private island</a> in Palm Beach, Florida, or 10 Bugatti Voiture Noires. </p> <p>That is what the record-busting $200m whistleblower reward announced by the <strong>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</strong> last week can buy. </p> <p>So it's no wonder <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95898e54-9975-4eff-bf97-298f3d67ef61\">the payout to</a> the former <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> employee, whose complaints led to a record<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ccf7af08-e904-11e4-a71a-00144feab7de\"> $2.5bn</a> in fines in the US and the UK to settle allegations that the bank manipulated the Libor benchmark rate, had heads turning on Wall Street.</p> <p>Experts <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4313f296-f693-4969-9605-1102cc6d8efd\">have told</a> the FT's Stefania Palma and Joshua Franklin any high-profile award tends to spark fresh rounds of tips. </p> <p>It happened in 2018, when three <strong>Bank of America </strong>employees were given $83m in awards in a case of misconduct at the broker-dealer arm of <strong>Merrill Lynch</strong>. The<strong> Securities and Exchange Commission </strong>received 5,282 tips that year, up almost 20 per cent from 2017.</p> <p><strong>Bradley Birkenfeld</strong>, a former <strong>UBS</strong> banker who was awarded $104m in 2012 through the IRS's whistleblower programme and fields calls from potential whistleblowers looking for advice, said he thinks “there'll be a lot of people coming out of the woodwork trying to think, ‘Hey, I've got that next big case'”.</p> <p>It's true that rewards are getting bigger and US whistleblower programmes are busier as longstanding probes that may have started at the beginning of these schemes, established by the Dodd-Frank Act a decade ago, come to a head.</p> <p>But bankers who may have suddenly found a higher moral calling would do well to manage their expectations — most rewards still sit in the single or double digit million range. The CFTC's $200m award was almost seven times larger than its second-biggest payout of $30m in 2018.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, a New York bank questioned whether the $200m cheque would lead to more cases that wouldn't otherwise have been reported.</p> <p>But past trends in tip numbers and the commotion caused by this mega payment could tell another story. It might just be that future whistleblowers with high-quality complaints end up affording just one Bugatti Voiture Noire, instead of 10. Boo hoo.</p> <h2>What T Rowe's big move into alternatives means</h2> <p>A major investor in private markets will be going public . . . sort of. </p> <p><strong>T Rowe Price</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9afafee6-d093-4087-b6cb-966fb978c183\">is buying</a><strong> Oak Hill Advisors</strong>, a $53bn in assets manager of private debt investments for $3.3bn in cash and stock, with the potential for earn outs to increase the value to $4.2bn.</p> <p>The deal is a watershed for T Rowe, a Baltimore-based investment firm led by <strong>Bill Stromberg </strong>that is synonymous with mutual funds and defined contribution retirement plans. </p> <p>In Oak Hill, it's moving into uncharted territory, buying a savvy investor in complex debts that had early backing from <strong>Robert Bass</strong>, one of four brothers who founded <strong>Bass Brothers Enterprises</strong>, a feared corporate raider in the 1980s.&#xa0;</p> <p>Oak Hill, a firm led by <strong>Glenn August</strong>, is among several fast-growing private debt investment firms that are the new centre of power in credit markets. </p> <p>Like competitors <strong>Sixth Street </strong>and <strong>HPS Investment Management</strong>, and large public alternative asset managers <strong>Ares</strong>, <strong>Apollo Global</strong> and <strong>Blackstone</strong>, Oak Hill specialises in illiquid debt investments such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a67e36e-b42f-42e1-8c17-042108fb014e\">direct loans to buyout firms</a>, structured securities and real asset strategies.</p> <p>These benefit from a “illiquidity premium” and the sheer complexity of assets such as collateralised loan obligations and other securitisations. Meanwhile, it's been a brutal environment for liquid corporate and sovereign debt markets, where yields continue to fall towards zero.</p> <p>The acquisition signals T Rowe's intention to expand into alternatives, particularly as they are opened to retail and high-net worth investors. But there are only a few traditional asset managers with the brand or financial resources to pivot into private markets. </p> <p>The mutual fund firms <strong>Franklin Resources</strong>, <strong>Janus Henderson </strong>and<strong> AllianceBernstein</strong> once traded at premiums to alternative firms but now carry steep discounts. Some, such as <strong>Legg Mason</strong> and <strong>Eaton Vance</strong>, have given up on public markets and sold out.</p> <p>The wild card potential acquirer is <strong>BlackRock</strong>, which is a backer of the alternative fund provider <strong>iCapital</strong>, underscoring its interest in the asset class. </p> <p>If BlackRock's <strong>Larry Fink</strong> does use its stock as currency to acquire a private equity or debt firm, it will be a turning of the tables for a group that won early backing from <strong>Blackstone</strong>, the world's largest alternative manager.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>The law firm <strong>Latham &amp; Watkins</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lw.com/news/latham-watkins-names-44-new-partners-39-new-counsel\">has named</a> 44 new partners.</p></li>  <li><p>Longtime <strong>Freshfields</strong> partner <strong>Matthew Herman</strong> is joining <strong>Goldfinch Partners</strong>, a US-based private equity firm, where he will be a partner and general counsel. He will be based in New York and begins next month. </p></li>  <li><p>The law firm <strong>Shearman &amp; Sterling</strong> has hired <strong>Xavier Norlain</strong>, <strong>Jeremy Scemama</strong>, <strong>Maud Manon </strong>and <strong>Matthieu Lampel</strong> as partners from <strong>DLA Piper</strong> in Paris. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Brunswick Group</strong> has recruited <strong>Andrew Williams</strong> and <strong>Errol Cockfield</strong> as partners in its New York office. Williams joins from <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and Cockfield moves from <strong>MSNBC</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>How not to face the music </strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson's use of the “Texas two-step” has cast a spotlight on the manoeuvre and how companies deploy it to cap personal injury claims.
