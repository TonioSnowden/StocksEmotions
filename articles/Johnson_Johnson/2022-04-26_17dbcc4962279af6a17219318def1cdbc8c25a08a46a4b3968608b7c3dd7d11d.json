  "title": "Johnson & Johnson Files Suit Against Alleged HIV-Drug Counterfeiters; Gilead initiated similar action last year against defendants it says allowed bogus medications to reach patients and pharmacies",
  "text": "<p>In a statement, J&amp;J said that HIV medicines became a focus of illegal counterfeiting in recent years. The company said it filed its lawsuit after its investigation found criminal activity involving unauthorized distributors.</p><p>Counterfeit medications can include fake pills, the wrong medication or genuine drugs that have faked documentation or altered packaging.</p><p>The lawsuit follows a similar complaint filed by Gilead Sciences Inc., which accused dozens of defendants of taking part in a network that led to more than $250 million of counterfeit HIV medications being sold to pharmacies over two years.</p><p>For pharmaceutical companies, counterfeiting poses serious risk of reputational damage and harm to patients if left unchecked. It is unusual for pharmaceutical companies to bring this type of trademark litigation, which requires intensive legal and investigative work to identify counterfeiters and seize their property, action typically undertaken by law-enforcement agencies.</p><p>The Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation into an alleged counterfeiting operation that overlaps with claims in the Gilead lawsuit, The Wall Street Journal reported in March.</p><p>J&amp;J alleged in its suit that three drug distributors—SafeChain Solutions LLC, ProPharma Distribution LLC and Scripts Wholesale Inc.—have sold large quantities of counterfeit HIV medications. J&amp;J said it had detected a recent spate of counterfeits of its products in the New York City area that came after Gilead filed its lawsuit last year.</p><p>Both the Gilead and J&amp;J lawsuits were filed by lawyers at Patterson Belknap Webb &amp; Tyler LLP.</p><p>J&amp;J alleged that several complaints of pills in the wrong bottle could be traced to SafeChain and Scripts and that ProPharma acknowledged possessing hundreds of bottles of J&amp;J HIV medication that proved to be counterfeit. The suit also names as a defendant I Care Pharmacy 14 Inc., which J&amp;J alleges is part of a sophisticated counterfeiting operation that remains active.</p><p>J&amp;J filed the lawsuit under seal in early April. While the case was sealed, a federal judge authorized J&amp;J to seize medication, information and communications from I Care and its owner. J&amp;J is also asking the court to permanently bar the defendants from selling the company's medications.</p><p>J&amp;J alleged that I Care rapidly became one of the biggest sellers of the company's HIV medications in New York City from April 2021 to December 2021, when it was discovered to be selling counterfeit drugs, J&amp;J alleges.</p><p>Steve Zissou, a lawyer for I Care owner Edward Gendin, said his client was \"an innocent pawn who had no knowledge whatsoever of any criminal activity.\"</p><p>SafeChain never received any complaints regarding J&amp;J products it sold, a company spokesman said.</p><p>A lawyer for Scripts declined to comment.</p><p>J&amp;J said counterfeiting endangers the health of patients who depend on its drugs to keep their HIV in check. Many of the counterfeits were of J&amp;J's antiviral drug Symtuza, a daily pill that suppresses viral loads of HIV to undetectable levels. When patients unknowingly take a different medication, the amount of HIV in their blood can rise and allow their disease to progress, J&amp;J alleged in the suit.</p><p>Counterfeiting could cause HIV patients to lose trust in the healthcare system or stop treatment altogether, J&amp;J said. One patient who received counterfeit Symtuza later couldn't be found for follow-up monitoring, J&amp;J alleged.</p><p>J&amp;J didn't specify the initial source of the alleged counterfeit drugs. Gilead has said its investigation determined that patients sold their HIV drugs, which were later resold with counterfeit instructions and documentation.</p><p>Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com and Joseph Walker at joseph.walker@wsj.com</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Files Suit Against Alleged HIV-Drug Counterfeiters</p>",
