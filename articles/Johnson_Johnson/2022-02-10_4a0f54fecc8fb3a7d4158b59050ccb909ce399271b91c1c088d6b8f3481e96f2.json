  "title": "Malawi struggles to vaccinate against Covid in Africa's crunch year for jabs  ",
  "text": "<p>Arnold John rode his gleaming silver bicycle for miles down the hot and dusty roads of Malawi's countryside to meet an appointment for a Covid-19 vaccine. </p> <p>“For me, the motivation was the death toll, to be hearing all the time about the people who were dying,” said John, a 31-year-old farmer, outside the clinic in Manondo, a village just outside the capital Lilongwe.</p> <p>The official Covid death rate in Malawi, which has a population of nearly 20mn and is one of the world's poorest nations, is 2,500 and is widely thought to be an underestimate. “I was aware that most of the victims were older, but I knew that a disease can affect anyone at any time,” added John. </p> <p>He is one of the lucky few — only 5 per cent of Malawians have been double jabbed, compared with 84 per cent of adults in the UK who have received two doses. With only about one in ten Africans twice-jabbed against Covid, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization director for Africa, has said that this year must be a “turning point” for vaccinations on the continent. </p> <p>“With vast swaths of the population still unvaccinated, our chances of limiting the emergence and impact of deadly variants are frighteningly slim,”&#xa0;she said last month.</p> <p>With poor roads servicing its largely rural population, a shortage of qualified staff and few hospitals, Malawi's problematic distribution of limited supply epitomises how far Africa has lagged behind the rest of the world in terms of vaccinations.</p> <p>Lilongwe received 2.8mn doses through the Covax vaccine initiative, set up to ensure access to vaccines for the world's poorest countries, of which 1.5mn were AstraZeneca, 800,000 were Johnson &amp; Johnson and the rest were Pfizer. It has also received about 600,000 Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines from the African Union. So far the government has only delivered about 1.9m vaccines through a fragile health system. </p> <p>With the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8506581-81a3-4cd2-bf3c-073eca9a0ae4\">Covax initiative</a> faltering because of lack of cash, it is unclear how many vaccines Malawi will receive in the coming months. An EU donation of €125mn to support Covid-19 vaccine distribution in Africa, announced on Wednesday, is a fraction of the $5.2bn Covax says it needs this year. </p> <p>With production of the vaccines set to start on the continent in the coming years in Senegal, Rwanda and South Africa, it is possible that this may ease supply constraints. But the problems go beyond supply. </p> <p>“A lot of people are looking at the doses as they are coming into countries. They're not looking at what it takes to get doses into arms,” said Titus Divala, a Malawian epidemiologist, adding “We need to look beyond just the doses. We need to think about this amount of effort.”</p> <p>The situation at Dzaleka, a refugee camp near Manondo, makes clear how difficult that effort can be. Crowded with about 50,000 refugees who fled conflicts in central and eastern Africa, daily life is a struggle for water and sanitation. Few people have time to wait for Covid vaccines. </p> <p>Mobile teams in speaker-rigged four-wheel drives patrol the camp to distribute AstraZeneca jabs, at one stop administrating oral cholera vaccinations for children too. </p> <p>“It's a very good turnout — people are understanding the benefit,” a team member said. But it would be much easier if more convenient single-shot jabs were available, she said. “It's all AstraZeneca . . . many say they want J&amp;J, but a lot are coming back for the second dose.”</p> <p>The Malawian government is now sending out “express” teams that combine village meetings to disseminate information with vaccinations offered on the spot. But this is still a laborious process with little funding. </p> <p>It is not also helped by the fact that sometimes vaccines arrive with short expiry dates. The government last year incinerated doses that arrived with slightly more than two weeks to spare — as opposed to the recommended three months — in order to reassure the public it was not giving out spoiled doses. </p> <p>Last year Albert Bourla, the chief executive of Pfizer, claimed that vaccine hesitancy was “way, way higher” in Africa than in developed countries, and that this would limit rollout more than supply in 2022.</p> <p>Such comments baffle health professionals in Malawi, which has a very high rate of childhood vaccinations. “These are not hardcore anti-vaccine people,” Divala said. “Hesitancy is not the correct language” when the main issue is lack of awareness of Covid vaccines in the first place. “When you speak to people, it doesn't take long. Within the same day the whole village will accept the vaccine.”</p> <p>At a hospital vaccination site in Bwaila, a suburb of Lilongwe, warnings about Omicron infectiousness had convinced Jane, a senior civil servant, to get the vaccine. “All this time, I've been resistant to the vaccine . . . there was so much speculation” about side effects, she said. </p> <p>She was hoping for the single J&amp;J shot, for it to be over and done with. There were none left so she got back in her car, ready to leave. She was eventually persuaded by a co-worker that it was better to get a jab than to wait for J&amp;J. A few minutes, one AstraZeneca jab — and a date for the second — later, “I'm fine, I'm OK,” she giggled.</p> <p>At the mercy of such sporadic supply and poor logistics, “it would have worked best if we were getting straight from manufacturers,” or better yet if the region could produce vaccines itself more freely, Divala said. Two decades ago, South Africa won a legal battle with drugmakers to devolve the manufacturing of life-saving HIV drugs. “We have not learned lessons from HIV as a planet and as a region,” he added.</p> <p>Back at Manondo, John said that “if there is a need for a booster, I'll also get one”. The struggle faced by Malawians to get even a single jab is in start contrast to plentiful booster supply in the west, he said. It “shows that there is an injustice in how vaccines are distributed,” he added. </p><p>Source: Joseph Cotterill and Golden Matonga in Lilongwe 2022 'Malawi struggles to vaccinate against Covid in Africa's crunch year for jabs  ' FT.com 10 February.
