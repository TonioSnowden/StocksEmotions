  "text": "<p>   New York City plans to offer tourists a shot of the Covid-19 vaccine as part of a push to draw more foot traffic to city attractions, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday. </p><p>   Mobile vans would be set up to jab visitors at Central Park, the Empire State Building and other sightseeing locations, the mayor said at a news conference. Tourists would be offered the one-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. </p><p>   The inoculations, Mr. de Blasio said, would offer a positive message to people looking to travel to the city, which saw tourism plummet during the pandemic. \"Come here, it's safe, it's a great place to be, and we're going to take care of you,\" the mayor said. </p><p>   The initiative still requires state approval because current rules only allow people living or working in the state to get vaccinated, Mr. de Blasio said. </p><p>   A spokesman for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   If approved, vaccination vans are expected to travel to Times Square, Brooklyn Bridge Park and other locations this weekend, the mayor said. </p><p>   The tourism industry, which accounts for hundreds of thousands of jobs in New York City, has nosedived during the pandemic. NYC &amp; Company, the city's official tourism organization, estimates that tourism numbers won't return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024. </p><p>   In 2019, a record 66.6 million tourists visited. Only 36.4 million are expected in 2021, according to NYC &amp; Company. </p><p>   In recent weeks, city officials started a $30 million campaign to let visitors know New York City is open for business. Before the pandemic, the city spent $3 million annually on tourism advertising, the officials said. </p><p>   Mr. de Blasio also recently allocated additional police officers to Manhattan business districts, including tourist-heavy Times Square, as part of a push to get workers to return to offices and to encourage tourism. </p><p>   Later this month, many Covid-19 restrictions are expected to be lifted in the city, allowing businesses, including restaurants, retail stores and movie theaters, to operate at full capacity. Businesses must still abide by social-distancing measures, which require parties to be kept 6 feet apart. Broadway shows will be allowed to reopen in September after closing in March 2020. </p><p>   On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio said the city would start to offer new perks for getting the vaccine such as discounts at restaurants and entertainment venues. The Museum of Natural History, for example, is offering four free tickets to those who get vaccinated at a facility there. </p><p>   Mr. Cuomo has said the state would offer free tickets to baseball games to people who get inoculated at Citi Field and Yankee Stadium. </p><p></p>",
