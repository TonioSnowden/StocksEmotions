  "text": "<p>On the party island of Mykonos the music is playing again. DJs are back in the bars, where curfews have been relaxed this week, umbrellas are back on the beaches and the serpentine, whitewashed alleyways of the old port are again thrumming with tourists.</p> <p>“It feels almost like Covid is disappearing and so everyone is much more relaxed,” says French architect Aude Mazelin, who holidayed on the island as a student 23 years ago and never left. Today, she lives in a house she refurbished on Paraga Beach, next door to Scorpios, a bohemian beach club full of driftwood daybeds and macramé hammocks where drinking and dining has resumed after lockdown measures. </p> <p>“Last summer, it was like going back to how the island was when I first arrived: all the beaches were empty, it was so quiet!”</p> <p>This has not been great news for the island's estate agents, for whom villa sales virtually dried up. “We don't want another 2020 but this year, thankfully, the island has suddenly opened up and we have some buyers arriving,” says Roi Deldimou, of estate agency Beauchamp Estates. </p> <p>International tourists and property hunters were largely absent last summer due to travel restrictions and, after a much-delayed start to the season, are only just beginning to return — although Middle Eastern visitors are still noticeably absent, Deldimou adds.</p> <p>Greece officially opened its doors to tourists in mid-May, and its government plans to vaccinate all 700,000 adult residents of its islands by the end of June. As of this week, nearly 9,500 of Mykonos's local population of 11,922 had been vaccinated, mainly with the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. </p> <p>The curfew has been lifted, nightclubs are open and private gatherings are allowed of up to 100 people. And, as part of “Operation Mykonos”, a dozen drones have been monitoring the island's luxury villas and beach bars for any non-compliant “corona parties”.</p> <p>The island is famed for parties held within its distinctive sugar-cube villas (some with eight-figure price tags) offering five-star services. Even before coronavirus, the HNWIs paying tens of thousands of euros for a week's accommodation preferred the privacy of detached villas in isolated clifftop or waterfront settings over big hotels, which are few and far between on the island. </p> <p>The yachts and private jets are trickling back, but the coronavirus pandemic brought to an abrupt halt the decade-long run of summers of increasingly lavish parties, and more tourists than the last. One of the poorest Greek islands after the second world war, a visit to Mykonos by Jackie Kennedy in the early 1960s started the trajectory that catapulted it from a backpacker magnet to a must-visit place for middle-class Greeks and summer playground for the international jet set.</p> <p>Although air arrivals into Mykonos plunged from 474,081 in 2019 to 132,807 in 2020, according to figures from the Greek Tourist Federation, private jet arrivals into Mykonos have surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Between January and June, the number of such flights increased 17 per cent on the same period in 2019, according to WingX, an aviation intelligence company.</p> <p>With no Land Registry figures available for Mykonos, it can be hard to determine annual transaction levels but long-established local agent Franceska Kalamara of Mykonos Dream Estates says 2020 was her worst year for a decade. In 2019 she sold eight properties and in 2020 just three villas. “This year is going to be better. I have a sale going through at €25m for a very large property for a buyer based in London,” she says. </p> <p>Many of the holiday villas are owned by people with multiple properties or financial interests. Ibrahim Radwan, a Saudi Arabian architect who has been holidaying on the island since 1992, is selling one of his two homes on Mykonos — he has others in Athens, London, Paris, Washington and Lebanon. He says that some vendors have very optimistic expectations about the value of their homes, especially when international buyers are still quite scarce.</p> <p>“Some people are asking crazy prices for their villas on this island now,” he says — admitting that the €3.5m price tag of his home is perhaps a “little exaggerated”. Villa Bimo is a four-bedroom property, located on the fashionable Psarou Beach — home to the notoriously hedonistic Nammos beach club — and where a few superyachts have already moored offshore. </p> <p>Until 2019, the property brought in a net annual revenue of 7 per cent from rentals from April to October, says Radwan, with rates of €6,000-€10,000 a night.</p> <p>He's selling up to move on to other opportunities — he has his eye on nearby Paros, Antiparos or Milos. But he plans to stay in his other property, in Mykonos Town, before the season gets too rowdy. “The island is now a place where you come to be seen and to party, to buy luxury brands, and to lie on the beach with a hangover. It's a mistake if you come expecting to find authentic Greece,” he says.</p> <p>Psarou Beach on the south coast marks the easternmost point where wealthy buyers tend to want a villa, says Deldimou. The most sought-after areas are in the west of the island: Aleomandra, Agios Lazaros, Agia Sofia, Tourlos, Agio Stefanos, Choulakia. These can offer views towards Mykonos Town, Delos Island and, especially, the glorious sunset. </p> <p>High-spec villas with good sea views in these areas are marketed at €10,000-€12,000 per sq m, compared with examples on the less developed east side of the island at €5,000-€6,000 per sq m. In the less touristy north of the island — popular for wind and kite surfers — your money can also go further.</p> <p>Ano Mera, the second-largest village after Mykonos Town, is where many locals live, says Areti Lampridi, who resides on the island full time and works in property: “You can buy a nice three-bedroom house for €300,000-€400,000.” </p> <p>Some businesses in the area have closed, she says. For jeweller Vassilis Kessaris, business dropped by 60 per cent in 2020 — which he says is typical across retail and restaurant businesses in Mykonos. With an average sale of €10,000 (Rolex and Patek watches are big sellers), he's keeping his head above water. “But one-third of this summer is already lost,” he says.</p> <p>You need a lot of money to live on Mykonos now, says Athens-born Annie Kalogirou, who owns a holiday home in Ornos, in the south-west of the island, with her French-Greek husband Alexi. It's on Costa Ilios, a private estate of holiday properties with a private beach.</p> <p>“When I returned to the island this spring, I was shocked to see prices in shops had gone up even further: three cans of sweetcorn in the supermarket in Mykonos cost €3.75; in Cannes it was €1.50,” she says. </p> <p>From the French city she runs MykonosLuxury, a concierge service. Extravagant requests from her clients have included sending a private jet to Athens for popcorn-flavoured ice-cream — less of a stretch than the time camels were flown in from Kuwait for an Arabian-themed party in Nammos four years ago. “It's a business island now, [it's] like the French Riviera,” she says.</p> <p>New Yorker Jeffrey Siger is returning to his holiday home on the edge of the Mykonos old town this week, 35 years after first arriving on the island. The author's latest novel, <em>The Mykonos Mob</em>, alludes to the “wildly profitable dark side of the island” that he says has evolved in recent years.</p> <p>Like other Greek tourist locations, Mykonos faces the issue of balancing expanding tourism with preserving traditional ways. To those who suggest it is not authentic Greece any more he says this: “Mykonian families that once sold watermelons off the backs of donkeys are now major business owners; instead of migrating elsewhere, young Mykonians can stay and prosper. Fun and partying has always been a part of Mykonos. It's just the packaging that has changed.”</p><p>Source: Liz Rowlinson 2021 'Ready to party: post-lockdown life brings wealthy buyers back to Mykonos' FT.com 29 June.
