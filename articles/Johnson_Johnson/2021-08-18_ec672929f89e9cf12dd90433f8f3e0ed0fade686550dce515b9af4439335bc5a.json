  "text": "<p>According to new data from The Harris Poll, at least 30% of Millennials or Gen Zers in the U.S. say they have cut ties with a friend, family member or acquaintance because they wouldn't get the COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>The poll, which was provided first to Axios, surveyed 1,334 U.S. adults in August 2021, and categorized them by generation.</p><p>See also: DraftKings admits some users got ‘extra chances' to buy the latest Tom Brady NFT release</p><p>The poll shows that 33% of millennials say they have cuts ties with somebody in their life over not getting vaccinated against COVID-19, compared with 30% of Gen Zers, 9% of Gen Xers and 7% of baby boomers.</p><p>“It's the new cultural dividing line,” John Gerzema, CEO of The Harris Poll, told Axios.</p><p>See also: What the Afghan government's collapse might mean for the U.S. stock market</p><p>Of all four generations surveyed, millennials are the group most likely to have younger children who are unvaccinated, which could contribute to the divide as parents may be concerned about the safety of their kids — none of the COVID-19 vaccines have been approved by the FDA for children under the age of 12 in the U.S.</p><p>In addition, older Americans tend to have a higher COVID-19 vaccination rate, which could contribute to the survey's generational divide. Older Americans may know fewer unvaccinated people as 90.1% of Americans 65 and older have received at least one dose of the vaccine, compared with 59.7% of the overall U.S. population, according to the CDC's COVID-19 vaccine tracker.</p><p>In the past few weeks, more&#xa0;employers announced plans to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations&#xa0;for workers who report to in-person offices. Employees can get shots developed by Pfizer PFE with German partner BioNTech BNTX or Moderna MRNA, or one shot of Johnson &amp; Johnson's JNJ&#xa0;single-dose vaccine.</p><p>See also: Can my employer make me get vaccinated?</p><p>Cases for the novel coronavirus continue to rise due to the highly transmissible Delta variant.</p><p>The survey comes as many U.S. cities are starting to roll out COVID-19 vaccination rules as cases in the hit a six-month high.</p>",
