  "title": "Justice Department Probes Network Accused of Selling Counterfeit HIV Drugs; Investigation targets unauthorized or fake versions of medications made by at least a dozen companies, according to people familiar with the matter",
  "text": "<p>The investigation at least partially echoes allegations in a 2021 civil lawsuit filed by Gilead, the people said, in which the drugmaker accused more than 70 defendants of taking part in a sweeping counterfeiting operation that sold more than $250 million of its drugs in the prior two years. Gilead said that even when bottles contained the original pills, they were counterfeit due to fake supply-chain documents and other alterations. The company identified at least eight bottles sold as HIV medication that contained the wrong pills, including over-the-counter painkillers and the antipsychotic Seroquel.</p><p>The HIV medications include drugs such as Gilead's Biktarvy, which has a list price of $3,584 a month, and Johnson &amp; Johnson's Symtuza, which runs more than $4,000 a month, the people said. The drugs are typically provided to low-income patients at little to no cost through federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid, or free by programs run by drugmakers for people without insurance. Gilead alleged in court documents that some defendants bought previously-dispensed HIV medications from patients and resold the drugs on the black market with fake documentation. The drugmaker said the medications were sold through a series of suppliers and wholesalers, then ultimately dispensed by pharmacies to different patients.</p><p>Secondhand medications pose a tremendous risk to the public, since they may have been mishandled, improperly stored or expired, said Scott Lampert, the top agent of the New York branch of the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General. \"You don't know how effective they are,\" he said. \"If you are being treated for HIV, you need the medication to work.\"</p><p>In addition, HIV patients who resell their medications instead of taking them could more easily spread the virus.</p><p>For federal benefit programs, resold drugs can lead to hundreds of millions in losses, because programs like Medicaid are essentially paying for the same drugs twice: once for the patient who sold the drugs on the street, then again for a second patient who unknowingly buys the same bottle.</p><p>Medicines used to treat HIV can be attractive to defendants because of their high value and lower risk than trafficking illegal drugs, which can carry steep mandatory minimum sentences and are more dangerous to transport, said Jennifer Beidel, a former Manhattan federal prosecutor.</p><p>\"The fraudsters are smart enough to know that Medicaid money has a huge denominator that's on the table,\" she said.</p><p>A spokesman for Johnson &amp; Johnson pointed to a December 2020 statement in which the company said that counterfeit Symtuza had been distributed to three U.S. pharmacies that procured the drugs from unauthorized distributors. A spokeswoman for ViiV Healthcare said the company hadn't received any reports of diversion, counterfeiting or trafficking of its medicines and patient safety remains a priority.</p><p>Gilead said earlier this year that it had reported counterfeit medication in circulation to federal law-enforcement authorities, dispensing pharmacies and consumers, and took legal action to stop counterfeit medication from reaching patients.</p><p>A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.</p><p>The alleged counterfeit drugs date to at least August 2020, when Gilead said it received a report from a pharmacy in California of foreign medication in a Biktarvy bottle.</p><p>In court documents, Gilead cited conversations between alleged participants in the counterfeiting ring. In chat messages, a co-founder of Safe Chain Solutions LLC, a Maryland-based wholesale distributor that Gilead has alleged knowingly sold counterfeits, asked whether there was any news about one of his suppliers, Synergy Group Wholesalers LLC.</p><p>\"[All] of their shit is counterfeit,\" wrote Adam Brosius, a minority owner of the company who was indicted on unrelated charges in federal court in New Jersey in 2020.</p><p>Safe Chain subsequently bought $2 million worth of additional counterfeit HIV medications from Synergy, Gilead said.</p><p>Safe Chain declined to comment. The company said in court filings that it reported instances of counterfeit Gilead products to the Food and Drug Administration and that it never created falsified documents.</p><p>Lawyers for Synergy and Mr. Brosius, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges in New Jersey, didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Separate messages show defendants allegedly discussing altering paperwork that documents a drug's path through the supply chain.</p><p>The current federal investigation follows previous government efforts to prosecute trafficking of HIV drugs.</p><p>In 2012, the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan charged 48 people in an alleged scheme to divert secondhand prescription drugs to the black market. Medicaid lost more than $500 million because of the fraud, the government alleged.</p><p>In a 2019 case, the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of California charged four defendants with a conspiracy to sell $70 million in black-market HIV drugs.</p><p>Joseph Walker contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com</p><p>Justice Department Probes Network Accused of Selling Counterfeit HIV Drugs</p>",
