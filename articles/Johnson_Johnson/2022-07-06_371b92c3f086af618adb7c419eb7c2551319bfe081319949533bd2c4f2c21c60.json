  "text": "<p>Personal-injury lawyers and the healthcare company disagree about how much those tort claims are worth. J&amp;J has denied that its baby powder was unsafe but moved its talc-related liabilities into chapter 11 in October to drive a settlement of roughly 40,000 pending talc cases as well as future injury claims.</p><p>J&amp;J created subsidiary LTL Management LLC to carry those or the company's talc liabilities into chapter 11, keep its consumer-health business out of bankruptcy and freeze lawsuits in place. Plaintiffs' lawyers have decried the bankruptcy filing, saying it will deny injury claimants their constitutional right to a jury trial.</p><p>J&amp;J has said that victims can be compensated more quickly and efficiently in a chapter 11 plan than through costly litigation in the tort system. Judge Kaplan agreed with J&amp;J in February that the chapter 11 was filed in good faith and for a valid reorganizational purpose.</p><p>A federal appeals court is now reviewing those findings. Meanwhile, mediated talks are continuing, though both sides appear to be at an impasse regarding a settlement proposal mediators have put forth, according to Judge Kaplan, who said he was considering how to move the process forward and encourage a resolution.</p><p>J&amp;J favors a court-supervised estimation of its talc liabilities in the chapter 11 case, while plaintiffs' lawyers want to allow a number of personal-injury cases to move forward in state court to test the strength of plaintiffs' claims.</p><p>Judge Kaplan said he wasn't inclined to unfreeze a limited batch of lawsuits and leave state courts around the country \"to concurrently undertake an examination of liability and damage issues.\" That would place an undue strain on those courts, the company and the plaintiffs, he said.</p><p>In the event he opts for an estimation instead, Judge Kaplan said he is considering appointing an independent expert to evaluate the parties' respective positions on how much J&amp;J should pay, based on \"a host of factors\" including its past settlements and jury verdicts on talc claims, as well as scientific issues around the alleged causal link between talc and cancer.</p><p>Though litigants most often hire and pay for expert witnesses, judges can appoint their own experts for assistance under the federal rules of evidence.</p><p>J&amp;J has pledged to pay for any amounts that LTL is deemed to owe talc claimants under a court-approved chapter 11 plan.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com</p><p>J&amp;J Talc Judge Weighs Expert Help to Value Cancer Claims</p>",
