  "text": "<p>The US and its allies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3142343-9c76-42c8-a949-634f662fddfb\">will “respond decisively”</a> if Russia invades Ukraine, President Joe Biden told his counterpart in Kyiv as tensions mounted over Moscow's troop deployments.</p> <p>The call between Biden and Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday was the latest diplomatic attempt to allay mounting tensions after Russia amassed about 100,000 soldiers on Ukraine's eastern frontier. Washington, Moscow and Nato member states are set to meet for talks this month, when Russia intends to press for “security guarantees” to limit the military alliance's expansion in Europe.</p> <p>Biden “reaffirmed” America's commitment to Ukraine's “sovereignty and territorial integrity”, while after the exchange, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1477766426945536001?s=20\">Zelensky wrote on Twitter</a> that the leaders had discussed “joint actions” by Ukraine, the US and partners “in keeping peace in Europe, preventing further escalation, reforms, de-oligarchisation”.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.
