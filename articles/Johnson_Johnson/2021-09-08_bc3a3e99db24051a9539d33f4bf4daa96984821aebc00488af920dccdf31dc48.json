  "title": "Pro Bankruptcy Briefing: Prosecutors Kick Off Theranos Case; J&J's Talc Strategy Explained",
  "text": "<p>At Theranos founder's trial, prosecutors must show intent. Silicon Valley startups are often perceived to be walking a line between exaggeration and deception in promoting their products. Federal prosecutors trying Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes in California must convince a jury that she didn't believe her own hype. The challenge is showing that Ms. Holmes's salesmanship of her blood-testing technology was intended to deliberately mislead investors and patients.</p><p>\"They have to prove she knew it was false and she said it anyway.\"</p><p>— Amy Deen Westbrook, a professor at Washburn University School of Law</p><p>How bankruptcy could help Johnson &amp; Johnson corral talc claims. Johnson &amp; Johnson has considered putting thousands of personal-injury claims over talcum-based baby powder into bankruptcy, hoping to drive settlements with victims of ovarian cancer and mesothelioma, according to people familiar with the matter. WSJ Pro Bankruptcy examines how a bankruptcy filing could affect the legal fight between the healthcare giant and the tens of thousands of people who allege that one of its former flagship products causes cancer.</p><p>Distress</p><p>Yield-hungry investors embrace unrated debt. Faced with yields once reserved for the safest types of government debt, some managers of speculative-grade bond funds are piling into debt with rock-bottom credit ratings. Others are buying smaller, more obscure securities that carry higher yields because they can be hard to sell. No strategy is likely to be entirely satisfying.</p><p>Economy</p><p>U.S. economy's September slowdown. Earlier this summer, many economists saw the week of Labor Day as the moment when the economic recovery would kick into high gear. Their expectation was that widespread vaccination would ease labor shortages. Schools and offices would reopen, which would mean a comeback for local businesses reliant on office workers. Travel would rebound. Instead, the rise of Covid's Delta variant has the nation tapping the brakes.</p><p>Bankruptcy</p><p>Governor's coal company to press Greensill claims. A coal supplier owned by West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said it would seek to continue pressing fraud claims over its dealings with now-collapsed U.K. lender Greensill Capital, despite a bankruptcy filing halting such U.S. litigation.</p><p>The remnants of Greensill filed for U.S. bankruptcy protection last month aiming to halt a fraud lawsuit filed in New York by one of its biggest clients, Mr. Justice's Bluestone Resources Inc.</p><p>Bluestone said Tuesday it would pursue a consensual route forward to continue to pursue its claims against Greensill. If that doesn't materialize, Bluestone said it \"may have no choice\" but to petition the bankruptcy court for permission to litigate in another venue.</p><p>In addition to Greensill itself, the lawsuit also named its founder Lex Greensill, alleging it defrauded Bluestone out of roughly $200 million.</p><p>He hasn't formally answered the lawsuit, which is on hold temporarily. Bluestone borrowed roughly $850 million from Greensill with help from a personal guarantee by Mr. Justice. — Andrew Scurria</p><p>George Washington Bridge station developer to liquidate. The bankrupt development consortium behind the remodeled George Washington Bridge Bus Station in northern Manhattan intends to liquidate after selling its retail leasehold in chapter 11. The developer, George Washington Bridge Bus Station Development Venture LLC, said in court papers filed Friday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan that it intends to convert to a chapter 7 liquidation after nearly two years in bankruptcy.</p><p>The development consortium is planning to liquidate weeks after selling its main asset, a leasehold covering about 120,000 square feet of retail space in the bus station, to the lending arm of JMB Capital Partners. The marketing and eventual sale of the leasehold was delayed for many months because of Covid-19. — Jonathan Randles</p><p>Hertz's $20 million deal in Mexican rental lawsuit. Hertz Global Holdings Inc. said it has reached a $20 million settlement with U.S. vehicle renters who complained that the business falsely advertised the cost of renting cars without disclosing alleged \"mandatory\" insurance for Mexican-based rentals.</p><p>The lawsuit, led by University of California, Berkeley economist and former Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco scholar Enrico Moretti, also said renters also were charged an \"inflated\" exchange rate.</p><p>Mr. Moretti, who filed his lawsuit in 2013, has said the total charge for his 10-day rental was $683.59, more than $300 more than he was quoted. The amount paid to each renter will depend on the number of days the vehicle was rented, how many valid claims are filed, and how much of the $20 million settlement remains after certain costs are covered and payments made to Mr. Moretti, who will seek a $75,000 incentive payment, according to papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., where Hertz emerged from bankruptcy earlier this year.</p><p>It is expected that each valid claim will get $26 a day for each Mexican rental, with reservations made online in the United States and picked up in Mexico, from roughly May 2009 to December 2018. — Becky Yerak</p><p>In Other News</p><p>A group of Gulf Finance LLC lenders has signed non-disclosure agreements to begin debt talks with company management and sponsor ArcLight Capital Partners, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
