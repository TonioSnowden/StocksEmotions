  "text": "<p>\n  WISCONSIN </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Judge Says Officer </p><p>\n  Can Be Prosecuted </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  A judge has ruled that police officer Joseph Mensah can be prosecuted for the 2016 killing of Jay Anderson, a Black man whose fatal shooting sparked protests last year. </p><p>\n  Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Glenn Yamahiro said Wednesday there was probable cause that Mr. Mensah operated a weapon in a manner constituting criminal negligence. </p><p>\n  On the night of the shooting, Mr. Anderson was asleep in his car in a park in the Milwaukee suburb of Wauwatosa. Mr. Mensah, who is also Black, stopped to question him and shot him through the passenger window, firing at least six times. </p><p>\n  Police say Mr. Anderson lunged for a gun on the passenger seat. Available dashcam evidence was inconclusive. Mr. Anderson's family deny he lunged for a gun, and question whether a weapon was on the passenger seat in the first place. </p><p>\n  Mr. Mensah didn't respond to a request for comment. He left the Wauwatosa police department last year, and was hired by the Waukesha County police department in January. </p><p>\n  \"The real question is whether a prosecutor, when they look at all the evidence, can determine whether they can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime has been committed,\"said Jonathan Cermele, the lawyer representing Mr. Mensah. \"Clearly that's not the case here.\" </p><p>\n  -- Talal Ansari </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  INDIANAPOLIS </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Killings of 8 at FedEx </p><p>\n  Site Not Hate Crime </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The gunman who killed eight people at a FedEx Corp. facility in Indianapolis in April was likely not motivated by bias or racism, investigators said. </p><p>\n  Investigators interviewed more than 100 people, executed more than 20 search warrants and combed through 175,000 computer files belonging to the shooter for months before determining the shooting wasn't a hate crime. \"The shooter did not appear to have been motivated by bias or a desire to advance an ideology,\" said Paul Keenan, the Indianapolis FBI's special agent in charge, at a Wednesday press conference. </p><p>\n  Nineteen-year-old Brandon Scott Hole, who was white, killed eight people, including at least four members of the Sikh community. </p><p>\n  The Indianapolis shooter sought to prove his masculinity to himself by experiencing what it was like to kill other people and then die by suicide, investigators determined. </p><p>\n  -- Ben Kesling </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  BALTIMORE </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Vaccine Production </p><p>\n  To Resume at Plant </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Emergent BioSolutions Inc. plans to resume Covid-19 vaccine production at its Baltimore plant after getting the green light from the Food and Drug Administration, according to a statement from the company and a letter from the FDA. </p><p>\n  \"We are proud to be resuming production of bulk Covid-19 vaccine batches,\" Emergent CEO Robert Kramer said Wednesday. </p><p>\n  The plant, which makes vaccines for Johnson &amp; Johnson, had been shut down by the FDA after its inspectors found contamination. </p><p>\n  The FDA said in a letter it \"does not object to the resumption of manufacturing\" at the plant. FDA officials didn't return calls for comment. J&amp;J didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>\n  -- Thomas M. Burton </p><p></p>",
