  "title": "Bankruptcy Judge Invites Appellate Review of J&J Talc Case; A federal appeals court should review whether Johnson & Johnson can move mass cancer lawsuits it faces to chapter 11, bankruptcy judge says",
  "text": "<p>Injury claimants argued that J&amp;J's strategy isn't permitted by the bankruptcy code and have sought to overturn Judge Kaplan's ruling. In it, he found the talc claimants as a whole were better off in chapter 11 than suing J&amp;J the tort system.</p><p>\"The question of the proper venue to litigate mass tort cases has been brought to the forefront and has generated the interestâ€¦of policy makers, media, a few very nasty people on Twitter and the like,\" Judge Kaplan said.</p><p>At stake are the roughly 38,000 lawsuits as well as potential future liability tied to J&amp;J's talc-based products, which the company stopped selling in the U.S. and Canada in 2020. The company has denied that its talc caused cancer and said a bankruptcy filing is the best way to get compensation to the most claimants quickly.</p><p>Judge Kaplan said that J&amp;J's strategy not only involves tens of thousands of injury claimants and \"billions upon billions of dollars\" but raises novel legal questions which have broader implications on how future mass torts are litigated and resolved.</p><p>An appellate court could weigh in on the judge's analysis of the benefits of the bankruptcy process over the civil trial system, a factor in his conclusion that J&amp;J had a valid purpose in moving its talc liability into chapter 11, Judge Kaplan said.</p><p>Wednesday's ruling positions injury claimants to potentially skip the federal district court level and move their appeal directly to the higher appellate court.</p><p>For that to happen, injury claimants must obtain permission for immediate review by the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The appellate court could decline to grant review, which would likely send the appeal instead to a federal district judge.</p><p>J&amp;J used an emerging legal strategy for solvent companies to unlock the tools of chapter 11 to resolve mass litigation, without having to place large business assets in bankruptcy. Last year, J&amp;J used a Texas law to separate talc-related liabilities from its consumer health business and create a new subsidiary named LTL Management LLC that was responsible for the mass litigation. LTL filed for chapter 11 two days later, taking the talc lawsuits with it.</p><p>Following a trial, Judge Kaplan ruled that LTL didn't file for bankruptcy in bad faith and said chapter 11 could speed up payments to cancer victims and, compared with other courts, provide a fairer resolution of the litigation.</p><p>The judge also rejected injury claimants' allegations that J&amp;J was attempting to escape the talc liability, saying bankruptcy court is an efficient forum \"to bring about accountability and certainty.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, Judge Kaplan said his ruling raises several legal questions which could merit Third Circuit review, including how a company's anticipated future liabilities should be taken into account when determining whether a chapter 11 case was filed in good faith.</p><p>LTL argued at trial that it faced a wave of lawsuits that was likely to grow significantly in the future. J&amp;J and LTL representatives are expected to meet with injury lawyers and mediators over the coming months to explore a possible resolution.</p><p>\"Clearly, whether you agree or not, I'm being blamed for a lot,\" Judge Kaplan said dryly in reference to his earlier ruling allowing LTL to remain in bankruptcy. \"This impacts decisions and restructurings or potential restructurings beyond what's being litigated in this court.\"</p><p>Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p>",
