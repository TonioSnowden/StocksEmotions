  "title": "U.S. News:  States Pressed to Hit Inoculation Goal  ---  Biden sets May 1 for all  adults to be eligible for  shot, as U.S. surpasses  100 million vaccinations  ----  By Stephanie Armour, Sabrina Siddiqui and Talal Ansari",
  "text": "<p>   President Biden's direction to states to make all adults eligible for coronavirus vaccines by May 1 will pressure governors and local officials to increase the pace of their rollouts, as the U.S. surpassed 100 million vaccinations on Friday. </p><p>   The milestone comes as the inoculation drive gains pace in the U.S. and as new cases of Covid-19 have dropped in recent weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's data-tracker website showed Friday that some 101 million doses of the three vaccines approved for use in the U.S. have been administered. </p><p>   Mr. Biden's plan is the strongest sign yet that the administration is confident that the current scarcity of shots will ease in the coming weeks. But getting the U.S. to the stage where health guidelines will bless people being able to gather in small groups by July 4, a goal championed Thursday by Mr. Biden, will face challenges. </p><p>   The U.S. must find enough health workers to give out the shots and create more mass vaccination sites. Officials must work to ensure underserved communities receive the vaccine, and hesitancy to take the vaccines is overcome. States will have to step up to the task even though some are still struggling with crashing appointment websites. </p><p>   \"We will have to dramatically increase our capacity, because we are not at that capacity now,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference Friday about reaching the May 1 goal. </p><p>   For Mr. Biden, there is a political risk that the public will view the May 1 goal as an expectation they will get the vaccine by then -- rather than merely being eligible -- as vaccinations are likely to continue throughout the summer. </p><p>   \"The vaccine won't be in people's arms May 1, but it will be available,\" said Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota disease specialist who advised the Biden transition team on Covid-19. \"One of my biggest fears is having enough vaccines but not having people who will take it.\" </p><p>   The administration can legally compel states to make all adults eligible by a given date because the vaccines were approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency-use authorization that allows the agency to release treatments in a declared emergency, said Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor. </p><p>   Because of the authorization, the Biden administration has wide discretion to establish conditions governing who should get the vaccines, he said. </p><p>   In recent days, the U.S. has been administering over two million doses a day. The shot made by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE has been given most frequently in the U.S., with more than 50.9 million doses injected, according to data from the CDC. Moderna Inc.'s vaccine has been given over 49.1 million times. The single-dose shot made by Johnson &amp; Johnson has been administered over 870,000 times. </p><p>   Mr. Biden announced plans this week to secure an additional 100 million doses of the J&amp;J vaccine, doubling the company's commitment. The administration has contracts with Pfizer and Moderna to provide 600 million doses of their two-shot vaccines. </p><p>   The White House said Friday it would expand the number of people qualified to administer vaccines across the country. Newly eligible vaccinators will include dentists, veterinarians, emergency medical technicians and students in professional healthcare fields, among other personnel. </p><p>   The Biden administration also said it would make the vaccine available at more than 20,000 pharmacies across the country as part of its federal pharmacy program, and more than double the number of federally supported mass vaccination sites. The administration will also launch a new website and a call center to help the public better locate where vaccine supply is available. </p><p>   Mr. Biden has moved quickly to allocate funding from a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, which was passed by Democrats on a party-line vote and signed into law by the president Thursday. That legislation provides $7.5 billion for vaccine distribution, $48 billion for testing and contact-tracing efforts and more than $160 billion for schools and universities. The White House said the Department of Health and Human Services would immediately dedicate $650 million toward expanding testing for teachers, staff and students in K-8 schools to help them reopen. </p><p>   \"This law is not the end of our efforts, though. In my view, it's just the beginning,\" Mr. Biden said Friday at a White House ceremony with congressional leaders to celebrate the relief bill. </p><p>   The administration has steadily increased weekly shipments to states amid overwhelming demand. The White House said the weekly doses going out to states, tribes, territories and pharmacies is now at more than 20 million. </p><p>   \"Supply is the main issue right now,\" said Ajay Sethi, an associate professor and epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who said states can open eligibility to the next priority groups as supplies increase. \"In Wisconsin, vaccinators are operating well below their capacity and continue to receive far fewer doses than requested.\" </p><p></p>",
