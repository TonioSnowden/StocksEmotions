  "title": "U.S. News:  Biden To Increase  J&J Dose Supply  ----  By Sabrina Siddiqui",
  "text": "<p>   President Biden directed his administration to secure an additional 100 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine by year-end and said he planned to share any excess vaccine supply with other nations. </p><p>   If an agreement with J&amp;J is completed, the additional supply would double the company's previous commitment to provide 100 million doses to the U.S. </p><p>   Taking into account commitments by Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. to provide 600 million doses of their two-shot vaccines, the U.S. is expected to have more than enough supply by the end of May to vaccinate the eligible U.S. population, Mr. Biden said. </p><p>   \"We need maximum flexibility. There's always a chance we'll encounter unexpected challenges,\" Mr. Biden said of his additional intended purchases on Wednesday, following a meeting at the White House with J&amp;J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky and Merck &amp; Co. Inc. CEO Kenneth Frazier. </p><p></p>",
