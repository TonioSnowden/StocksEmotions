  "text": "<p>J&amp;J's talc bankruptcy shipped to New Jersey. A bankruptcy judge said Johnson &amp; Johnson can't keep its preferred jurisdiction for trying to settle of thousands of claims linking talc-based baby powder to cancer. Now the company will face its creditors in New Jersey, which the judge called the \"superior jurisdiction\" for handling J&amp;J's talc-related liabilities.</p><p>The decision, a setback for J&amp;J, concerns the ongoing debate over lenient venue-selection rules that allow troubled companies to file for chapter 11 protection in courts located far away from their headquarters.</p><p>Boy Scouts accuse survivor group of breaching voting rules. The youth group accused a sex-abuse survivors committee of improperly disparaging other victims' lawyers in its efforts to whip votes against a $1.9 billion compensation plan. The dispute comes amid an increasingly acrimonious battle over the Boy Scouts' offer, which would lift the youth group out of bankruptcy but has divided abuse survivors and their lawyers.</p><p>Share this email with a friend.</p><p>Distress</p><p>Equinox nets financing to ease potential SPAC deal. Equinox Group LLC has obtained $255 million in new financing commitments from some of its lenders and owners, aiming to bridge itself to a potential SPAC deal, people familiar with the matter said.

He had said on an earnings call that he would soon begin selling some of his shares, but maintained he still has \"an enormous personal stake in the future of our company.\"</p><p>International</p><p>China plans to take Evergrande apart, but slowly. The Chinese state is dismantling the giant developer slowly and behind the scenes, hoping to limit the damage to home buyers and businesses involved in Evergrande's projects. The plan illustrates China's challenge in cracking down on excessive property lending without strangling the country's housing boom or causing other developers to fail.</p><p>To manage those risks, authorities are considering making it easier for strained property firms to unload assets and cover debts. How? By allowing property buyers to take over the assets without having the projects' associated debt affect their own tightly-regulated debt ratios. Stocks and bonds of Chinese developers jumped on signs that Beijing could moderate its tough stance on the beaten-down property sector, while Evergrande again averted default by making another set of last-minute bond payments.</p><p>In Other News</p><p>A Puerto Rico court suspended an arrest order for Luma Energy Chief Executive Officer Wayne Stensby, saying the company that manages the island's electricity transmission and distribution system had complied with its instructions to hand over additional documents to local lawmakers.
