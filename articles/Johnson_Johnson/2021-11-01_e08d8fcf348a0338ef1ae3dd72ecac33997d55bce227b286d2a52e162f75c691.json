  "text": "<p>The decision shows that, despite receiving substantial financial support from the U.S. government, the Novavax vaccine will be used in other countries first.</p><p>Novavax said it expected additional countries to authorize the vaccine in coming weeks and months.</p><p>The small Gaithersburg, Md., company has run into manufacturing challenges that have pushed back its timelines on seeking U.S. regulatory clearance and boosting output of doses.</p><p>The company last year received a $1.6 billion federal contract to develop its vaccine and to provide 100 million doses for U.S. use.</p><p>The authorization \"exemplifies our commitment to equitable global access and will fill a vital need for Indonesia, which despite being the fourth most populous nation on earth, continues to work to procure sufficient vaccine for its population,\" Novavax Chief Executive Stanley C. Erck said.</p><p>The two-dose vaccine was shown to be 90.4% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 disease in a large clinical trial, and was generally safe and well-tolerated.</p><p>Novavax's vaccine contains proteins that resemble the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus and that are supposed to trigger an immune response to the virus once injected. Novavax manufactures the proteins in insect cells.</p><p>The vaccine also contains an adjuvant, a substance designed to enhance immune responses. Novavax's adjuvant is derived from the bark of an evergreen tree native to Chile.</p><p>Novavax has a manufacturing partnership with Serum Institute of India, an established vaccine maker in India. Under the partnership, SII plans to make about one billion doses of the vaccine.</p><p>SII is manufacturing the doses that will become available in Indonesia.</p><p>Several other Covid-19 vaccines already have been authorized for use in Indonesia, including those from Pfizer Inc., AstraZeneca PLC and Sinovac.</p><p>Novavax also has applied for regulatory authorization of its vaccine in India, the Philippines, the European Union, the U.K., Canada and Australia.</p><p>The company said it expects to file for U.S. authorization of the vaccine by the end of this year.</p><p>About 58% of the U.S. population already has been fully vaccinated with other vaccines, from Pfizer with partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Novavax also has committed to supply 1.1 billion doses of its vaccine to Covax, the international initiative to provide vaccine doses to low- and middle-income countries.</p><p>Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com</p><p>Novavax Covid-19 Vaccine Gets First Authorization, in Indonesia</p>",
