  "title": "Business News: J&J Results Rise With Dollar, Costs",
  "text": "<p>J&amp;J is likely to make modest cuts to its workforce both as a result of economic pressures and in connection with the planned separation of its consumer-health business next year, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said in an interview.</p><p>The consumer business, which sells Tylenol and Band-Aids, will be called Kenvue.</p><p>\"We're not immune to some of the economic pressures that are out there just like many companies are facing in many industries,\" Mr. Wolk said. \"So we're taking this opportunity to really look at the resources, how we deploy them.\"</p><p>Mr. Wolk said various job functions would be affected, though he didn't provide a number and saidit wouldn't be a major restructuring. The company will continue to invest in research and development and hire new scientists, he said.</p><p>He said the company has an obligation to look at whether it can achieve cost savings as it shrinks to two segments -- pharmaceuticals and medical devices -- from three via the consumer-health separation.</p><p>For the third quarter, J&amp;J posted a quarterly profit of $4.46 billion, or $1.68 a share, up from $3.67 billion, or $1.37 a share, a year earlier.</p><p>Adjusted for one-time costs, the company's per-share profit was $2.55. Wall Street analysts had forecast an adjusted profit of $2.48, according to FactSet.</p><p>Overall sales rose a little less than 2% to $23.79 billion. The company estimates that currency adjustments lowered worldwide sales growth by 6.2%.</p><p>Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting quarterly sales of $23.36 billion.</p><p>J&amp;J's biggest unit, pharmaceuticals, posted sales of $13.2 billion, up 2.6% from a year earlier, helped by strong growth in sales of cancer drugs.</p><p>The company's Covid-19 vaccine generated global sales of $489 million, down 2.7% but higher than what some analysts expected.</p><p>Earlier this year, the company backed off its full-year forecast of Covid-19 vaccine sales, citing a global surplus of doses and uncertainty over how the course of the pandemic would affect demand. J&amp;J's vaccine has been used less than Covid-19 vaccines from Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc. with its partner BioNTech SE.</p><p>The company's MedTech unit, which includes heart devices and knee replacement parts, had sales of $6.78 billion, up 2.1%.</p><p>Mr. Wolk said hospital-procedure volumes are returning to normal after being disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>J&amp;J's consumer-health sales declined slightly to $3.8 billion, as currency effects offset underlying growth in over-the-counter medicines and skin-care products.</p><p>Mr. Wolk said the company increased some consumer-product prices in the second quarter, which helped third-quarter sales.</p><p>\"All three segments actually accelerated growth from where they were in the second quarter,\" Mr. Wolk said.</p><p>The company's cost of products sold, which includes labor, rose by 7.7% from a year earlier.</p><p>The company cut its full-year sales guidance to a range of $93 billion to $93.5 billion, excluding sales from the company's Covid-19 vaccine. In July, J&amp;J guided for full-year sales of $93.3 billion to $94.3 billion.</p><p>J&amp;J narrowed its guidance for full-year operational sales, which also excludes the impact of currency-fluctuations, to a range of $97.5 billion to $98 billion.</p><p>Shares of J&amp;J fell 0.4% to $166.01 on Tuesday.</p><p>So far this year, the company's stock was down almost 3%.</p>",
