  "text": "<p>The indexes pulled out of their latest selloff in part on the strength of earnings reports, including those by some of the nation's biggest banks. Investors were bracing for evidence that many companies were already mired in a slump. So far, they have been pleasantly surprised, said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial.</p><p>\"The pessimism has been palpable, and the bar had come down for earnings reporting,\" Ms. Krosby said. \"We've seen primarily positive surprises. When you have a market that's oversold, it doesn't take much of a catalyst to have it move up.\"</p><p>Investors said the big gains and losses underscored angst over a possible recession and the pace of interest-rates increases, rather than fundamental changes in the economy. Adding to those worries, recent inflation data showed rapid price growth has been hard to slow, making it more likely that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates aggressively.</p><p>\"We're going into a global recession so there's very little scope for anything to be rallying,\" said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. \"There's still a downtrend here.\"</p><p>The next big test for the market is earnings season. Results gather pace this week with reports due in the coming days from Goldman Sachs Group, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Netflix and Tesla, among other major companies.</p><p>Results and guidance from executives about the next few quarters will pose a test for a market that has been buffeted by rising rates this year.</p><p>Though analysts cut estimates for third-quarter earnings growth in recent months, some investors say forecasts are still too upbeat about the prospects for corporate profits over the next year, given the likelihood of a recession.</p><p>The U.S. is forecast to contract and unemployment to rise in the coming 12 months, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of economists.</p><p>\"The market has priced the Fed hikes and the tightening of financial conditions quite well but it hasn't priced the impact of that tightening yet,\" Mr. Redha said.</p><p>Shares of Bank of America rose $1.92, or 6.1%, to $33.62 after the lender said per-share earnings topped analysts' forecasts in the third quarter. Some of the biggest U.S. banks reporting last week said they were nervous of a recession, but their third-quarter earnings showed few signs of one.</p><p>Bank of New York Mellon, the world's biggest custody bank, jumped $1.95, or 5.1%, to $40.36 after also reporting results that beat expectations.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged up to 4.012%, from 4.005% Friday. Yields have risen for 11 consecutive weeks, driven by the Fed's campaign of interest-rate increases.</p><p>Brent crude, the global benchmark, settled down slightly to $91.62 a barrel.</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the greenback against a basket of other currencies, fell 0.8%.</p><p>Global markets were broadly higher. The Stoxx Europe 600 climbed 1.8%.</p><p>U.K. government bonds and sterling rallied after the government said it is reversing nearly all of its proposed tax cuts and will pare back an energy price cap.</p><p>The tax cuts had sent U.K. markets into turmoil and led the Bank of England to launch an emergency intervention, which ended Friday.</p><p>Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.8%, but the Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index were down 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.6%.</p>",
