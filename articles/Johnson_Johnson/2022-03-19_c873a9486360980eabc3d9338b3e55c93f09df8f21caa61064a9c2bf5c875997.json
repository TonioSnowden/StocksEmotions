  "title": "U.S. News:  Second Booster Faces Fiscal Hurdle  ----  By Stephanie Armour",
  "text": "<p>   The Biden administration's tentative plan for a rollout of second Covid-19 booster doses in the fall is being roiled by funding questions. </p><p>   The White House has been considering making second booster doses available to the general public around the same time they would get their annual flu shots, if research finds the extra shot shores up immunity. But Congress hasn't appropriated any more money for buying the additional boosters and other pandemic measures. </p><p>   The White House had asked Congress for $22.5 billion in further Covid-19 funding. Congressional Republicans, however, have called to repurpose money earlier earmarked for Covid-19 that states haven't yet spent. A plan to do that as part of a smaller, $15.6 billion rescue package failed recently when several House Democrats balked at clawing back funds. </p><p>   At issue is new money for Covid tests, care of the uninsured and replenishing the dwindling supplies of antibody drugs, vaccines and boosters. The tentative fall booster campaign is also now up in the air, the officials say. The administration doesn't have the authority to move funds or divert cash from other programs to pay for the shots, an official said. </p><p>   So far in the pandemic, the federal government has ordered and paid for vaccines. That role is expected to shrink as private insurers take on an expanded presence. The administration recently required private insurers to cover the cost of at-home tests. To encourage vaccine uptake, however, the White House wants to keep providing Covid shots and treatments so people don't face costs. </p><p>   To generate support for more government funding, the administration has launched a campaign to galvanize lawmakers, state leaders and the public. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the president, spoke to Democratic leadership Thursday about the need for funding. </p><p>   Finding money to pay for another round of boosters is pressing, the officials say, because the government needs to place orders now to have enough doses if they are needed for a broad fall campaign. </p><p>   Some health experts say the funding impasse could add more obstacles to curbing Covid transmission and moving past the pandemic. Yet, health experts so far disagree on whether the general public or just the elderly and those with weaker immune systems should get a second booster. </p><p>   Meanwhile, U.S. public-health officials are cautiously watching Covid caseloads rise overseas as a newer version of the Omicron variant spreads and restrictions loosen. </p><p>    Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE asked the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday to authorize a second booster of their vaccine to people ages 65 years and older. A separate White House plan to offer second booster shots to seniors is still possible in the spring, administration officials say, if the FDA authorizes the extra doses for the group. </p><p>    Moderna Inc. asked the FDA on Thursday to clear a second booster for all adults 18 years and older to give health authorities the flexibility to determine the best use of an additional booster shot. </p><p>   Some studies have shown the efficacy of the messenger RNA vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which are both administered in an initial two-dose regimen, fades after several months. </p><p>   Boosters' efficacy at preventing hospitalization fell to about 78% at four months compared with more than 90% in the first two months, according to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p><p>   A small study from Israel showed that a second Pfizer-BioNTech booster shot increased antibody levels. </p><p>   Israel, Japan and England are among the countries that have begun or are considering a fourth round of shots for mRNA vaccine recipients. </p><p>   Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla recently said a fourth shot would be necessary. The company also is looking at a vaccine tailored specifically to thwart the Omicron variant that is widespread. Moderna President Stephen Hoge has said a fourth shot could be beneficial but has stopped short of saying it would be necessary for everyone. </p><p>   So far, U.S. health authorities recommend initial boosters for everyone 12 years and older who received Pfizer's vaccine, starting at least five months after completing the first series. Moderna boosters are recommended at least five months after the initial regimen for people 18 and older. And a booster is recommended for people 18 and older who received a Johnson &amp; Johnson shot. </p><p>   The FDA must decide whether to authorize second boosters for all adults and whether a booster should be tweaked to target Omicron. </p><p></p>",
