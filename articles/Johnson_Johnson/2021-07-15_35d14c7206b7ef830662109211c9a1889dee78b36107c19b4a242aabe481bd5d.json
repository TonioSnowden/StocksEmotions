  "title": "Business News:  J&J Recalls 2 Spray Sunscreen Brands  ----  By Felicia Schwartz",
  "text": "<p>   Johnson &amp; Johnson is recalling most of its Neutrogena and Aveeno spray sunscreens from U.S. stores after detecting benzene, a potentially cancer-causing chemical, in some samples. </p><p>   J&amp;J said Wednesday that consumers should stop using and discard five of its six Neutrogena and Aveeno spray sunscreens. </p><p>   The company said it also was notifying distributors and retailers to stop selling the products and arranging for the return of the products. </p><p>   A company spokesman said the effort would include removing products from shelves. </p><p>   The New Brunswick, N.J., company said it doesn't use benzene in the manufacturing of the spray sunscreens and is investigating the cause of the contamination. </p><p>   The company is in touch with regulatory agencies in other countries about the issue, a company spokesman said. </p><p>   J&amp;J, one of the world's biggest sellers of consumer-health products by sales, didn't say how many bottles were affected and what the exact benzene levels were, though J&amp;J said the levels were low and not expected to cause health issues. </p><p>   The spray products affected, J&amp;J said, are sold as Neutrogena Beach Defense, Neutrogena Cool Dry Sport, Neutrogena Invisible Daily, Neutrogena Ultra Sheer and Aveeno Protect + Refresh aerosol sunscreens. </p><p>   The company sells one other spray sunscreen product, Neutrogena Wet Skin, which isn't affected, J&amp;J said. </p><p>   The recall came after an online pharmacy said it found high levels of benzene in 24 sunscreens and other suncare products. The pharmacy, Valisure LLC, petitioned the FDA to remove the products, including some of those recalled by J&amp;J. </p><p></p>",
