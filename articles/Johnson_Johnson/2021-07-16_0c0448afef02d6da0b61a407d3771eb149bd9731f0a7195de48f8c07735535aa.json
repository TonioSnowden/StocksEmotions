  "text": "<p>   Vodafone faced only one other bidder for an Ethiopian wireless license: South Africa's MTN Group, a longtime Huawei and ZTE user whose proposal was backed in part by the Chinese government-owned Silk Road Fund, which was designed to help finance Belt and Road projects. </p><p>   In May, Ethiopia announced only one winner: the U.S.-backed consortium. </p><p>   The deal might not shut the door on Chinese gear. Vodafone, which isn't obligated to follow through on the loan, said it is still finalizing which equipment suppliers to use. </p><p>   And it is unclear whether the U.S. wants to go through with the loan either. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has criticized Ethiopia's government for not allowing humanitarian access to the country's Tigray region, where he said there were credible reports of human-rights abuses amid a violent conflict. </p><p>   A DFC spokeswoman said it and other U.S. agencies were monitoring the situation in Tigray \"and will carefully consider its impact on any potential financing of the Vodafone consortium.\" An Ethiopian government spokeswoman said humanitarian groups have had access to the region for months, and that the government is focused on improving people's lives through initiatives like the telecom project. </p><p>   Sen. Coons isn't surprised the DFC has faced challenges. \"Doing development and infrastructure investment in the developing world is inherently risky -- that's the point,\" he said. </p><p>   The Biden administration considers the DFC one of its most powerful foreign-assistance tools because of its large investment cap and flexibility to offer loans, equity financing, grants and insurance, said Mr. Singh, the deputy national security adviser. He said the White House is focusing the DFC on four areas: health, technology, climate change and gender equality. </p><p>   In March, after President Biden met with the leaders of Australia, India and Japan, the White House asked the DFC to collaborate with the allies on a health initiative. The DFC asked the U.S. Embassy in India, one of the world's biggest vaccine-making countries, to identify pharmaceutical companies it could join with. </p><p>   That's how Mahima Datla ended up on a call with Mr. Marchick and other DFC officials. \"They said, 'If you had access to capital, how many more vaccines could you make?'\" recalled Ms. Datla, managing director of vaccine-manufacturer Biological E Ltd. </p><p>   Biological E had already agreed to produce at least 600 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson's one-shot Covid-19 vaccine, at a pace of 50 million a month. She said a DFC loan would enable her to add a third assembly line to her Hyderabad facility and produce 100 million doses a month. </p><p>   Ms. Datla and DFC officials agreed to a provisional deal in less than a month. </p><p>   DFC officials say that while advancing healthcare in the developing world is the main motivation behind the potential investment, providing an alternative to Beijing's vaccine diplomacy is also a factor. </p><p></p>",
