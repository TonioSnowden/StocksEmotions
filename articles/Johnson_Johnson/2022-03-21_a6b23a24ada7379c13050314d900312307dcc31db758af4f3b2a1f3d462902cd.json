  "text": "<p>Can U.S. citizens visit Canada now?</p><p>If you are fully vaccinated, the answer is likely yes. As of Aug. 9, fully vaccinated Americans who meet other Canadian government criteria began to be allowed to enter Canada for nonessential purposes such as tourism and recreation.</p><p>Fully vaccinated tourists from other countries also gained permission to enter Canada as of Sept. 7, as long as they meet all the government's Covid-19 travel requirements and, depending on their citizenship, have a valid visa or electronic travel authorization.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Planning to travel to Canada? Share your stories with us by joining the conversation below.</p><p>Travelers need to wait at least two weeks after their last vaccine dose before crossing the border. As of April 1, they no longer need to present proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken before their arrival in Canada. However, they still can't have any symptoms of the disease when they arrive at the border.ï</p><p>Throughout the pandemic, Canada allowed its own citizens or permanent residents to enter the country. Essential workers—most notably truck drivers—were able to cross the border as both countries agreed that trade of goods and services wouldn't be affected. That changed as of Jan. 15, when Canada required essential workers like truck drivers, professional athletes and others previously exempt from public-health orders to be fully vaccinated for Covid-19 to gain entry. The U.S. imposed similar measures on Jan. 22.</p><p>The measures related to truck drivers helped spark a series of protests in the Canadian capital, Ottawa, and at border crossings in Montana and Detroit, causing delays and detours for some Canada-bound travelers.</p><p>Canada's border rules could also have an impact on the upcoming Major League Baseball season, with unvaccinated MLB players unable to join their teammates on trips to Canada for games against the Toronto Blue Jays. A new labor contract agreed to in March says players won't be paid or receive service time for any games they miss because of their vaccination status.</p><p>Vaccine uptake among MLB players has been lower compared with athletes in other American professional sports.</p><p>Do I need to be fully vaccinated to cross the border?</p><p>If you're traveling for nonessential reasons, such as tourism or to visit a property in Canada, you need to be fully vaccinated with an accepted Covid-19 vaccine or a combination of two different accepted vaccines.</p><p>Canada accepts Covid-19 vaccines authorized by its regulator, from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca PLC. Canada also accepts vaccines approved by the World Health Organization, thereby adding China-made Sinopharm and Sinovac, and Covaxin from India.</p><p>Fully vaccinated tourists are permitted to bring unvaccinated children under 12 years of age to Canada. As of Feb. 28, the Canadian government said children in that category can enter the country without limits on their activities, although it warned that some provinces or territories might have stricter rules.</p><p>Children ages 12 to 17 who aren't fully vaccinated must take Covid-19 tests upon pre-entry, arrival and on their eighth day in the country. They are also required to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.</p><p>What documents do I need to travel to Canada?</p><p>Travelers need to upload proof of vaccination and other information to a Canadian government app or website called ArriveCAN before they board a flight or reach a land crossing. They also must carry a paper or digital copy of their proof of vaccination with them.</p><p>Those who meet all the government's requirements won't have to quarantine. As of April 1, proof of a negative Covid-19 test is no longer a requirement for fully vaccinated travelers entering Canada.</p><p>Travelers who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated must still provide proof of a test—although children aged 5 to 11, accompanied by a fully vaccinated adult, are exempt. This can be a negative molecular Covid-19 test taken during the 72 hours before a scheduled flight to Canada or arrival at the land border or proof of a professionally administered or observed antigen test, taken no more than one day before a scheduled flight to Canada or entry by land. Proof of a previous, positive molecular Covid-19 test result taken between 10 and 180 calendar days before entering Canada is also acceptable.</p><p>Randomly selected travelers might still also be required to take a Covid-19 test upon arrival in Canada.</p><p>What are the current Covid-19 restrictions in Canada?</p><p>Although face masks are no longer required for public transportation in the U.S., the Canadian federal government's masking rules remain unchanged. That means passengers must continue to wear masks while inside Canadian airports and for the full duration of any flight to or from a Canadian airport.</p><p>The Canadian rules permit passengers to remove their masks only for brief periods while eating, drinking or taking medication, or if they have an exemption such as a medical certificate saying they are unable to wear a mask.</p><p>\"Masks are proven to provide additional layers of protection and we will continue to follow the advice of our public health experts,\" Canadian Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said on April 19.</p><p>Canadian regional authorities have also eased restrictions implemented late last year to contain the spread of the Omicron variant. Canada's most populous province, Ontario, no longer requires patrons to show proof of vaccination before dining at restaurants or attending other venues, and masking requirements for most indoor settings were dropped on March 21.</p><p>Federal rules on vaccination remain in place: Anyone who wants to board either an airplane or a long-haul passenger train in Canada—for domestic or international travel—must be fully vaccinated.</p><p>What is the Covid-19 situation like in Canada?</p><p>Canada recorded a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases starting in early December driven by the Omicron variant, but cases peaked in early January and later fell dramatically. Confirmed cases were rising again as of April 18, but remained well below the January peak.</p><p>About 82% of Canadians were fully vaccinated as of April 18, compared with 66% of Americans. Canada is ahead of the U.S. by a sizable margin in administering Covid-19 booster doses, according to the University of Oxford's Our World in Data.</p><p>What happens when I go back to the U.S.?</p><p>Fully vaccinated Americans flying back to the U.S. will need to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test administered no more than one day before traveling, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Documentation of a recent recovery from Covid-19 is also acceptable. Those driving back across the land border aren't required to show proof of a negative test result.</p><p>If you develop symptoms of Covid-19 or test positive for the disease, you are expected to self-isolate and delay any travel.</p><p>Can Canadians enter the U.S.?</p><p>The U.S. on Nov. 8 started to allow foreign nationals to cross the land border from Canada and Mexico for nonessential purposes such as shopping or visiting family and friends.</p><p>Canadians can continue to fly into the U.S. with proof of a negative Covid-19 test administered before arrival. They also need to be fully vaccinated.</p><p>Michelle Hackman contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com and Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com</p><p>U.S.-Canada Border Restrictions: What to Know About Crossing Requirements</p>",
