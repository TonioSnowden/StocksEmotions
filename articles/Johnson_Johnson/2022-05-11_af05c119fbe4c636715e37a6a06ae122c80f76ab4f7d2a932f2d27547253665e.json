  "title": "J&J Talc Claimants Win Appellate Review of Bankruptcy Case; A federal appellate court agreed to consider an appeal challenging J&J's use of chapter 11 to resolve mass cancer litigation",
  "text": "<p>The appeal stems from a February ruling by Judge Michael Kaplan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Trenton, N.J., declining to throw out the chapter 11 case of LTL Management LLC, a newly formed J&amp;J subsidiary created to carry talc-related liabilities into chapter 11.</p><p>Judge Kaplan agreed with J&amp;J that the bankruptcy case was filed for a valid purpose, saying that chapter 11 provides cancer victims with a fairer and more efficient forum to receive compensation than the civil jury system. Injury claimants argued that J&amp;J's strategy isn't permitted by the bankruptcy code and have sought to overturn Judge Kaplan's ruling through an appeal.</p><p>The ruling kept roughly 38,000 talc injury lawsuits paused in bankruptcy, aiding J&amp;J's efforts to settle current and future claims alleging its talc-based baby powder caused cancer, which the company denies.</p><p>Despite allowing the bankruptcy case to proceed, Judge Kaplan said in March the Third Circuit should review his decision as soon as possible. To access bankruptcy, J&amp;J used a Texas law to fill the LTL subsidiary with talc-related liabilities and limited business operations before it filed chapter 11.</p><p>Wednesday's decision by the Third Circuit lets injury claimants skip the federal district court level and move their appeal directly to the higher appellate court.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Randles at Jonathan.Randles@wsj.com</p><p>J&amp;J Talc Claimants Win Appellate Review of Bankruptcy Case</p>",
