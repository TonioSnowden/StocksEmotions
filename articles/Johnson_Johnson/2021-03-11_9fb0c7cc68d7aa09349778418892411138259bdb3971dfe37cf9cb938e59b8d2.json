He has made the legislation a top priority and its passage will clear a path for the president to shift focus to other areas of legislation, including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1eca9de7-8ce5-41f9-8dbd-86289aa4705a\">expanding infrastructure spending</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be93b72d-73c6-457b-8d6e-d4c4a89167cb\">reforming voting laws</a>.</p> <p>But reaching this point involved <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c63ed896-59bf-49f3-885a-b10c9fdf06fb\">one of the most delicate missions</a> in US politics, balancing the desires of conservative Democrats from swing states with those of progressive lawmakers desperate for the boldest possible action after four years of Donald Trump in the White House. It also involved hours of talks with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b96550b7-67d8-4dee-9e5c-1fee565401af\">Joe Manchin</a>, the recalcitrant Democratic senator from West Virginia.</p> <p>The passage of the American Rescue Plan will speed up the economic recovery from the pandemic. The White House hopes the huge new injection of US government spending will also reduce income inequality and poverty&#xa0;in the US and help <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/134487f6-84bf-4512-b135-aec78bb2487c\">rebalance the economy</a>. It has already led to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19496e49-1d36-4929-b27c-b85539e0f4a7\">a surge in confidence</a> among large US employers.</p> <p>Biden is scheduled to address the nation in a televised primetime speech later on Thursday in which he is expected to address the pandemic and “what the path forward looks like”.
