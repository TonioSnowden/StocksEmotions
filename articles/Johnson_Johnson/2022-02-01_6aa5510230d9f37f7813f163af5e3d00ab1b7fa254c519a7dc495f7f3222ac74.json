  "text": "<p>Under the settlement, Johnson &amp; Johnson agreed to pay $150 million to tribes over two years. Distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp., McKesson Corp. and Cardinal Health, Inc. will pay more than $439.9 million over seven years. It is separate from a previous $75 million settlement reached between the distributors and the Cherokee Nation.</p><p>The deal follows a historic $26 billion settlement that the four companies reached last July with states including Tennessee, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New York, Louisiana, Delaware and Connecticut.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson said the settlement announced Tuesday wasn't an admission of wrongdoing, and the company would continue to defend itself against litigation. In a statement, the drugmaker called its marketing and promotion of prescription opioids appropriate and reasonable. Johnson &amp; Johnson added that it no longer sells prescription opioids in the U.S.</p><p>A spokesman from Cardinal Health declined to comment. Representatives from McKesson and AmerisourceBergen didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Thousands of lawsuits from states, local governments and Native American tribes have claimed the pharmaceutical industry played a substantial role in fuelingthe opioid epidemic. From 1999 to 2019, the nation lost nearly half a million people to overdoses of prescription and illegal opioids, according to federal data.</p><p>More than 400 federally recognized Native American tribal governments and 17 intertribal organizations filed lawsuits against opioid manufacturers, distributors and some pharmacies. Those tribal governments and intertribal organizations represent about 85% of all tribal citizens, according to the court filing Tuesday.</p><p>Write to Jennifer Calfas at jennifer.calfas@wsj.com</p><p>Native American Tribes Reach $590 Million Opioid Settlement With J&amp;J, Drug Distributors</p>",
