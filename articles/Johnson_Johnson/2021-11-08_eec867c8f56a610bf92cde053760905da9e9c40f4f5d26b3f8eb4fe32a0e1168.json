  "title": "Aaron Rodgers' State Farm TV Ads Cut Back After Vaccine Comments; NFL star says he is unvaccinated against Covid-19 and has questioned vaccine effectiveness",
  "text": "<p>State Farm ads featuring Mr. Rodgers also declined on Saturday, with Mr. Rodgers appearing in less than 2% of ads compared with 13% and 15%, respectively, the two previous Saturdays.</p><p>Mr. Rodgers became the center of controversy last week when he tested positive for Covid-19 and was placed into the league's protocols for unvaccinated players. That came after he was asked earlier in the year if he was vaccinated, to which he replied: \"Yeah, I'm immunized.\"</p><p>After testing positive, Mr. Rodgers went on a sports talk show to criticize the NFL and its health policies implemented to prevent the spread of the virus, saying they weren't rooted in science and treated vaccinated and unvaccinated players differently. The vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective at preventing severe illness while also reducing transmission and spread.</p><p>A State Farm spokeswoman didn't confirm whether the insurance company pulled some of its ads featuring Mr. Rodgers. \"We constantly review our marketing strategies and adjust advertising placements,\" she said.</p><p>She added that while State Farm doesn't support some of the statements Mr. Rodgers has made, it respects his right to personal opinions.</p><p>\"Aaron Rodgers has been a great ambassador for our company for much of the past decade. We don't support some of the statements that he has made, but we respect his right to have his own personal point of view,\" the State Farm spokeswoman said in a statement.</p><p>\"We encourage vaccinations, but respect everyone's right to make a choice based on their personal circumstances,\" she added.</p><p>In prior weeks, State Farm ads featuring Mr. Rodgers appeared on NBC, ABC, Fox and CBS, among other national TV networks. This past weekend, they mostly appeared on specialized sports networks such as NBC Sports, Golf Channel and Bally Sports, \"with no Rodger-specific [ads] on network television,\" Apex President Eric Smallwood said in an interview.</p><p>\"There was a substantial shift in removing the Rodgers spots\" and replacing them with old ads, such as those featuring Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Mr. Smallwood said. Apex only has data on State Farm ads featuring Mr. Rodgers going back to Oct. 23.</p><p>Also over the weekend, Wisconsin healthcare provider Prevea Health said it was ending its partnership with the Green Bay Packers quarterback, who served as a spokesman promoting the group's health initiatives since 2012. The organization said in a statement on Saturday that it is committed to protecting patients and staff, including through helping eligible populations become vaccinated against Covid-19.</p><p>Mr. Rodgers said his decision to not receive one of the three vaccines approved in the U.S. was based on extensive research about what was best for his body. He claimed that he was allergic to the two mRNA vaccines, from Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc., and didn't trust the one-shot vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson. He didn't specify his allergy.</p><p>Mr. Rodgers said last week he believed he was immunized because of his conversations with \"healers\" rooted in holistic and homeopathic medicine, saying they worked to stimulate his immune system. He said he had previously filed an appeal to the NFL to count him as vaccinated, but the league denied it.</p><p>Mr. Rodgers missed Sunday's Packers' game against the Kansas City Chiefs due to Covid-19 protocols.</p><p>Write to Omar Abdel-Baqui at omar.abdel-baqui@wsj.com</p><p>Aaron Rodgers' State Farm TV Ads Cut Back After Vaccine Comments</p>",
