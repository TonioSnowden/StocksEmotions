  "text": "<p>What prompted you to launch your own firm?</p><p>My partner Neda and I have known each other for north of 20 years. We went to business school and worked at McKinsey &amp; Co. together. She went on to work at L Catterton and I was working on the operating side at Estée Lauder Co. and then at Johnson &amp; Johnson as the global president of the beauty division, a multibillion [dollar] division. From our respective seats, we were seeing the same thing happening in the market in the consumer sector: specifically the emergence of a new modern consumer that has entirely different preferences than those before them. Consumers are looking for authenticity, transparency, health and wellness, a different set of criteria than the prior generation. We saw new brands emerging and scaling more rapidly than before. We believe the top 10 brands of tomorrow will be markedly different than the top 10 brands of today because of this new demand. We felt there was a gap in the market for a firm like ours, which is dedicated to growth equity and founded with 50% investing and 50% operating experience.</p><p>What was the most difficult thing about launching your firm?</p><p>I think coming from massive institutions to now being entrepreneurs came with certainly a whole host of challenges. First, I would say no one had ever heard of us. The day after you start your firm, no one has ever heard of you. The first challenge is establishing your firm in the market. You really have to go out there and hit the pavement. We went to conferences, met with every banker, entrepreneur and strategic company. We established ourselves and our name and reputation—we're ultimately thrilled at the brands we attracted into the fund. The fact that we are a modern firm was attractive to the founders as well as the fact we were entrepreneurs. They see in us the same grit and perseverance that they see in themselves. Secondly, I would say a big challenge was building out the team. When we started, it was just the two of us. Now, we have a team of seven. We ultimately are just thrilled with the extraordinary caliber of talent we've been able to attract, nurture and grow. One of the first things we did was start a recruiting process with models and case studies. We were very happy with the caliber of candidates coming through and ultimately were able to attract great talent.</p><p>What advice would you give to other women who want to strike out on their own?</p><p>I would say first and foremost is being confident in your convictions. I think when you're starting everything on your own, it takes tremendous conviction. Confidence in your vision is what I believe helped us fundraise successfully; we have a fantastic group of LPs. That conviction is what is going to get the brands excited. Confidence in your conviction. If you have a vision, you can't waiver from it. Second is leveraging your network and people you've built relationships with. These are the first people you go to for advice. If you foster the right relationship, you'll be supported as you go on your own. As you advance in your career, the world gets smaller. It's a small world in the consumer sector. I think from day one in your career, if you're starting as a very junior analyst, performing at your best, building relationships, doing the right thing for yourself and others, all of those things will serve you well in the years to come. The world is small and your reputation is everything.</p><p>Hollie Haynes, founder and managing partner, Luminate Capital Partners</p><p>What prompted you to launch your own firm?</p><p>I wanted to focus on exactly what I was focused on at Silver Lake, which were growth software companies where we could do control deals. That became a narrow slice of what Silver Lake did. I wanted to do that outside of the larger firm to build a brand outside. I felt like I could do it, in the end I had confidence that I could do it. At some point in this business, even at a large firm you gotta find deals, make that work, build a team, do deals, build investment judgment, etc. I had to do that whether I was on my own or at Silver Lake. I probably somewhat naively thought if you did deals, you could get LPs.</p><p>What was the most difficult thing about launching your firm?</p><p>For me, the most difficult thing at the time was convincing people it was happening. It was a stone soup effort—make the firm into something so you're an entity that people want to deal with. You have to get people to want to transact with you. It's just really hard to convince people that you're really a firm and can actually get a deal done. Related to that were all the things that go into that. Getting people to give you money, that was the hardest thing. Or people who were advising or selling companies. It's hard to be taken seriously. In retrospect, partly it just takes time, it mostly doesn't work. If you decide you're gonna get married when you're 25, that's well and good, but you have to date a lot of people. I think a lot of it is how you choose to look at it. I just started making calls and mostly they didn't go anywhere, whether it was to convince a possible LP on a deal we might one day find or convince an adviser or seller to show us a deal. Starting a fund is like starting every business—you don't need everything to work, you just need a couple of key things to work. We found a deal four months in, we found someone to be the LP to get that deal done. A lot of keeping things going in the early days is claiming small victories and knowing where to pounce. Defining success in a narrow way: All you need is one deal, one LP. I kept narrowing my definition</p><p>What advice would you give to other women who want to strike out on their own?</p><p>I think the only thing that matters is making investors money. That is all that matters in starting your own firm or raising a fund. You need to get them to believe you can do it, or you have to do it. The name of the firm, location, how big the team is [are] not as important as making people money and doing that again. Getting some credibility. That's the good news, because I think it really is that simple. There's a lot of noise and distraction, but if you focus, the odds for success are very high. I think you can be discouraged. Most LPs say no even when you ultimately raise a fund. It's a business of no, even when you look like you're successful. Leading with news is important. You can't keep calling people. You need to give them something to make it more interesting. At the same time, I would hope LPs would be open to new people, new types of people being entrepreneurs in this industry and running firms.</p><p>Michelle Noon, managing partner and co-founder, Clearhaven Partners</p><p>What prompted you to launch your own firm?</p><p>There were two reasons. I had hit an inflection point in my own career where it was time to bet on myself. I continue to carry forward what works really well, leaving behind some things that didn't work well. There are a lot of downsides that come with a blank sheet of paper, but there are a lot of upsides too. You're free to create culture from scratch. As we present ourselves in the market with companies and investors and not deal team by deal team, we try to combine a specialization in software and create a team and a culture that was not about me, but was a reflection of some of the things that you found important. I had about a six-month runway pre-Covid. We're just about rounding the corner on the second year. It certainly tests your conviction in starting something. You've got to be insane or very convicted on the opportunity. We [had] high conviction. About a year ago, we had half of the team that we do now. We were so convinced the market opportunity was significant and we had been in and around the space enough that we had some goodwill to call on to start a firm like this. I was really humbled to find out a lot of the goodwill that was built up did carry forward to me as a deal maker and to my partner as an operator. We started building step by step and really set out to do two things well: pursue great deals in lower midmarket software and software-driven technology companies and build a great team.</p><p>What was the most difficult thing about launching your firm?</p><p>I think the first scary door to walk through was: I thought I had developed a good reputation for doing what I said I'd do and as a deal maker in the space for a bunch of years. You don't know about that for sure until you ask people to take you seriously, introduce you to companies, and have investors take a phone call. I didn't start out with big anchor investors. I started from scratch. That was the first scary door. I was fortunate to see that lots of years in a space does accrue to your advantage if you're a good actor. The second challenge—setting Covid aside, which added a layer of complexity—was building a firm infrastructure: the very basics of taking an idea and putting it into operation, executing deals, recruiting teams and to do all of that at the same time [is] three full-time jobs at once. That doesn't go away immediately, but we're getting close to me not having all three of those jobs. We built a fantastic team of investment professionals and a back-office team. That was certainly the next challenge and a massive learning curve, at the same time it was interesting. I had been in the same industry for a long time. This was something new and it was a challenge. I like the learning, it's been incredibly rewarding. Now we need to go deliver.</p><p>What advice would you give to other women who want to strike out on their own?</p><p>I would say get as much experience as you can learning from others who have paved the path forward. We need more women who are senior leaders in PE. It's not happening fast enough organically. It'll take women starting firms as well. It's a great thing for the industry. I learned from many other founders of PE firms, men and women, everyone was willing to talk. They were generous with time and experience. That goes a really long way. The senior women community is a highly supportive community. Rely on that. Everybody's willing to share their experiences, the positives and the negatives. There are lots of ways to pave new paths. There is one short life to live, I viewed that very seriously when I was thinking about starting the firm. It could be a success or failure, but to me it was worth trying. We are far from a declaration of success at Clearhaven. We are hungry to prove ourselves. I am available to talk to anyone considering starting their own firm.</p><p>Amy Wildstein, founder and managing partner, Suttona Capital</p><p>What prompted you to launch your own firm?</p><p>Essentially I started Springboard and subsequently Suttona Capital in part to address a funding gap for female entrepreneurs and a white space to invest in female founders. The numbers have inched up, but the amount of money going to female venture founders has remained below 10% [of total venture investment]. Prior to launching in 2016, I interviewed many of the 800 female founders in the Springboard accelerator. We decided to focus on later-stage [rounds], Series C and beyond. We like to say our tagline for Suttona is we're one of one female-focused growth-equity fund. While it's nice to have that competitive differentiation, I hope others join in as well. I'm a believer that you have to believe it to see it.</p><p>What was the most difficult part of launching your firm?</p><p>I'd say one of the biggest challenges is there is really limited data to support the idea of having a diversity mandate and having that top of funnel requirement. For us, a woman has to have a key role in the C-suite, though it does not have to be the founder. There's a lack of data supporting the fact that having the top of funnel criteria won't negatively impact returns. We looked at PitchBook data, specifically around financing for female-focused funds, and found that rounds of more than $25 million led by funds with a diversity mandate total fewer than 10 deals. We launched as a fundless fund. We give transparency around the underlying asset and we bring our LPs into individual funds that have a single portfolio company and that provides a higher level of transparency into the asset. That takes that big challenge away. They don't need to worry about what happens at the top of the funnel; they're looking at the bottom of the funnel. In terms of fundraising, I think one of the biggest challenges for our model is lining up time frames, different challenges than first-time fundraising, but there's certainly a lot of execution and a lot of resources that go into it. We've been able to attract an interesting LP base that does not see a comparable product elsewhere. It's differentiated.</p><p>What advice would you give to other women who want to strike out on their own?</p><p>Don't ever underestimate the value of your network, leveraging and nurturing it actively. I've spent a lot of time over the last two decades working to support female founders with Springboard Enterprises. I've also focused on the fund side as well, network of female-focused funds as well as others. One example of the most important network for me—one of my most interesting deals in the pipeline of Suttona—came from a founder who was in a deal I invested in at Morgan Stanley. It definitely pays off to keep in touch.</p><p>Patricia Lizarraga, managing partner, Hypatia Capital Group</p><p>What prompted you to launch your own firm?</p><p>I started the firm over a decade ago. It has always been about investing in women. I wish there were more women in the finance industry. It's creative and fun. In absolute numbers, the U.S. economy is so large, there are actually thousands of us. I wanted to break off and start a firm that wants balance, right off the bat. I believe in balance, and I wanted a professional experience that included senior women as clients, colleagues and investors.</p><p>What was the most difficult part of launching your firm?</p><p>I think the challenges to striking out on your own are that, particularly as it relates to investing in women and leadership, there isn't a clear mandate either from the top leadership of the asset management industry or from the allocators. There is not a clear and implementable mandate by the leadership of the allocator industry, neither are the grass-roots [beneficiaries] demanding it. Any teacher pension fund by definition is probably 90% women, but how much of those [assets] are managed by women? Is the teacher saying, ‘I want my pension managed by women?' Are they not given any information that shows that women outperform? There's not a clear mandate from the top or the bottom, therefore the needle has not really moved.</p><p>What advice would you give to other women who want to strike out on their own?</p><p>My advice is to leverage your network and vet your idea as much as you can before making the leap. And make sure to protect yourself from a financial point of view. It's going to take longer than you thought, and also to really understand that with doing anything innovative, there are going to be barriers. Really steel yourself for the fact that you're going to have to break some barriers, and not everyone is going to want change. Especially, if you're going to be gender-focused, I think it really matters. If you're doing anything that has to do with societal change, [it] takes a very long time and you have to be prepared.</p><p>Suzanne Yoon, founder and managing partner, Kinzie Capital Partners</p><p>What prompted you to launch your own firm?</p><p>I would say personally it was a lifelong influence of multiple factors. I came from an immigrant family. My parents were immigrants from South Korea. Watching my parents build a life as a first generation American here, I think I always knew there was a responsibility, something they instilled in me when I was very young. If I worked really hard and studied, [I] could achieve the American dream. Later, in terms of starting the firm, it took me years to take the leap, but I had built my career between New York City and Chicago, and I wanted to return to Chicago and have a firm headquartered there. I really believed in the value that I could bring to the market.</p><p>What was the most difficult part of launching your own firm?</p><p>One is just overcoming your own self-doubt about whether or not you can do it, and all the challenges that come with being a woman in a man's world. We have to face the fact that the hurdles are higher, and often the narratives around women's successes and failures are different. It was [also] really challenging when you come from institutional [firms], because you had to wear so many hats. You're handling everything from investing to operations and human resources. I sometimes would joke that I was the head of IT.</p><p>What advice would you give to other women who want to strike out on their own?</p><p>Be prepared. It takes a lot of hard work, grit and sacrifice. There is an enormous amount of risk involved, and you are ultimately accountable to an awful lot of people: your investors, your employees, your partners and your entire family. Be resilient, because for every ‘yes,' there are hundreds of ‘no's.' Learn from the setbacks, because there will be plenty and also learn to look past them toward the higher goal you have.</p><p>Cristina Nuñez, co-founder and general partner, True Beauty Ventures</p><p>What prompted you to launch your own firm?</p><p>Some of my best decisions in life have come out of times of uncertainty and challenges. In the past, my career has been a combination of a straight path in finance and then private equity. I was in New York for 12 years, and I moved back home to Miami, because my father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. So I left my job to be there for my dad. It was one of those moments where I had always been so tied to my career and defining myself by my professional achievements and for the first time I didn't have a path. I think those moments of uncertainty make you take a step back and realize, what do you want to do with your life? What are you good at? It was that moment of being able to assess what I wanted to do in combination with a little bit of luck and a reconnection with a former colleague of mine, Rich Gersten. He also had a similar revelation of: Gosh, we should do something different. We should partner together. We took a step back and said, ‘Where is there a white space to do something that's never been done?' The white space was there and our skill sets were unique and complementary, so we decided to launch a venture-capital fund in the middle of Covid.</p><p>What was the most difficult part of launching your own firm?</p><p>One was the Covid pandemic and having to raise a fund over Zoom, which benefited a small fund, because you're not traveling as much and spending as much on flights or hotels. But you also don't have as much time to create a connection.</p><p>What advice would you give to other women who want to strike out on their own?</p><p>Surround yourself with an amazing network. I used to be wired that I didn't want to ask for help and that asking for help is a sign of weakness. What I learned is to surround [myself] with strong networks of other women and networks that support women. Breaking down that barrier of not wanting to ask for help is so crucial to success.</p><p>Write to Laura Cooper at laura.cooper@wsj.com and Laura Kreutzer at laura.kreutzer@wsj.com</p>",
