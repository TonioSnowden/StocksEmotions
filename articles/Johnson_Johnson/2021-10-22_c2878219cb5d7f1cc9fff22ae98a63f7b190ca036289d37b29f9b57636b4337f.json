  "title": "U.S. News: CDC Backs Moderna, J&J Boosters --- CDC advisers also supported mixing primary shots with a different booster dose",
  "text": "<p>\"These recommendations are another example of our fundamental commitment to protect as many people as possible from Covid-19,\" Dr. Walensky said.</p><p>The CDC didn't recommend any of the boosters over the others. Some advisory panel members, however, said they would prefer if people who received a J&amp;J vaccine get a booster from Pfizer Inc . and partner BioNTech SE  or from Moderna.</p><p>The moves follow the Food and Drug Administration 's authorization Wednesday of Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson  booster shots. The FDA  also said people can get an extra dose that is different from the vaccine they received for their primary series.</p><p>While the FDA  regulates medical products, the CDC offers guidance about the practice of medicine, and many vaccination sites have been following the agency's direction.</p><p>The Biden administration has sought boosters to bolster vaccinated people's immune defenses, especially against the contagious Delta variant. Some health experts, however, say there isn't enough evidence to support giving boosters widely.</p><p>\"I can't say I am comfortable that anyone under 50, otherwise healthy, needs a booster at this time,\" said Sarah Long, a committee member who specializes in pediatric infectious diseases at Drexel University College of Medicine .</p><p>The panel's first vote was 15-0, backing boosters six months after their second dose for Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna vaccine recipients who are seniors, have underlying medical conditions or at high risk of Covid-19 because of where they work.</p><p>The second vote -- backing a booster of any kind for people 18 years and over, at least two months after receiving the Johnson &amp; Johnson  vaccine -- also was 15-0.</p><p>Some panel members said they would prefer that Johnson &amp; Johnson  vaccine recipients get an extra dose of Pfizer -BioNTech or Moderna rather than another J&amp;J dose. They said another J&amp;J dose could potentially cause a rare side effect, a blood clotting condition that is linked to the J&amp;J vaccine, and that a messenger RNA dose might also offer stronger protection.</p><p>The booster campaign has been rolling out since August, starting with extra doses of either the vaccine from Pfizer -BioNTech or from Moderna for people with compromised immune systems. Then last month, seniors and high-risk people began getting an additional dose of the Pfizer -BioNTech shot at least six months after they had finished getting the two-dose primary series.</p><p>Under the FDA 's latest authorizations, all three approved vaccines now have a booster shot. In addition, any adult who got a J&amp;J vaccine may get a booster from Pfizer -BioNTech, Moderna or J&amp;J at least two months after the single-dose shot.</p><p>People who initially were vaccinated with a Pfizer -BioNTech or Moderna shot can get any booster at least six months after their second dose as long as they are seniors or at high risk because of underlying medical conditions or their workplace.</p><p>The shots will be free and available at pharmacies, doctors' offices and vaccination sites around the country. The U.S. will have enough shots to meet demand, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>The J&amp;J booster is the same dose as the first vaccine, and the Moderna booster, regardless of what vaccine a person received first, is half the dose as the first two shots.</p><p>The U.S. vaccine campaign is expected to continue to expand in the coming weeks. The FDA  is expected to next clear Pfizer  vaccines for children age 5 to 11 years old, and is also weighing whether to expand the booster campaign to people as young as 40 years old, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>More than 69 million people are fully vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine, and more than 15 million people have received the single-dose J&amp;J shot, the CDC said. Nearly 105 million have gotten the Pfizer -BioNTech vaccine.</p><p>The panel also reviewed new information about the risks of myocarditis, particularly in young men, after inoculation with the Pfizer -BioNTech and Moderna vaccines that both use messenger RNA technology.</p><p>Some safety databases found a heightened risk of myocarditis among people ages 18-39, particularly men, after being vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine as compared with the Pfizer -BioNTech shot, according to analyses by a vaccine-safety committee.</p><p>The FDA  has delayed clearing Moderna's vaccine in adolescents while it assesses the risk of myocarditis, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Preliminary data on patients 18 to 39 years old found that the cases generally are mild and resolve quickly, the analysis of the vaccine-safety committee shows.</p>",
