  "title": "Healthcare Deals Set to Surge in 2023",
  "text": "<p>On one side, you had cash-rich drug companies staring down a $200 billion patent cliff. On the other side, you had plenty of cash-starved smaller-size biotech companies, whose valuations took a hit during the market downturn, offering discounted assets.</p><p>Yet 2022 turned out to be relatively slow. The health sector's aggregate deal value dropped 56% to $202 billion year-to-date, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence wrote in a report published Dec. 19.</p><p>Some of the sluggishness had to do with an imbalance in expectations. Because the stock market was so volatile in 2022 after a stellar 2021, some chief executives of target companies were hesitant to accept a valuation reset right off the bat. Meanwhile, acquirers saw 2021 highs as ceilings, not as a realistic baseline from which to launch negotiations. Johnson &amp; Johnson Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk told analysts as much during an earnings call in October, when he said sellers hanging on to their 2021 record highs didn't make for a conducive deal-making atmosphere.</p><p>Yet that is starting to change, with the gap between acquirers and their targets narrowing. Soon after Mr. Wolk's comments, J&amp;J on Nov. 1 announced one of the largest healthcare deals this year, agreeing to buy heart pump maker Abiomed for $16.6 billion in cash. The $380 price per share represented about a 50% premium over Abiomed's closing price the day before the deal was announced, but it wasn't far from the company's 52-week high set in November 2021. A similar dynamic was at play for the year's largest healthcare deal announced this month: Amgen's $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. While the $116.50 per share reflected a nearly 50% premium over the closing price prior to news of the talks, it was right around what Horizon was trading about a year ago.</p><p>The two sizable deals in the past two months of 2022 signal that the bid-to-ask spreads are starting to narrow, meaning 2023 might be a much better year for M&amp;A. While Amgen might be tapped out given how levered it becomes after the Horizon deal, many drug and medical device companies are just getting started, with lots of balance-sheet capacity and plenty of appetite as top-selling drugs lose patent exclusivity.</p><p>Despite the Abiomed deal, J&amp;J is expected to be a top acquirer next year. It was one of Horizon's original suitors and is widely expected to continue pursuing deals as its top-selling immunology drug Stelara loses patent protection. Another big deal maker in 2023 will likely be Pfizer. While it potentially has the most deal capacity -- and the biggest need given the risk to some of its product lines -- Pfizer seems to be choosing to do a string of smaller acquisitions rather than a megadeal. In 2022 alone, Pfizer bought Arena for $6.7 billion, Biohaven for $11.6 billion, Global Blood Therapeutics for $5.4 billion and ReViral for less than $1 billion. Between cash on hand and its ability to take on debt, Pfizer has more than $100 billion in additional firepower, Goldman Sachs estimates.</p><p>A megadeal could come from Merck. The company was in talks to acquire Seagen for about $40 billion before those talks hit a snag. But management has left the door open to doing a large deal as it looks to replace the expected revenue hit once Keytruda, its blockbuster cancer drug, goes off patent later this decade.</p><p>In all, next year could bring M&amp;A deal value in the pharma and life-sciences space to somewhere in the range of $225 billion to $275 billion, PricewaterhouseCoopers wrote in a report. With so much dry powder and plenty of targets to look at, deal-making next year looks set to heat up.</p>",
