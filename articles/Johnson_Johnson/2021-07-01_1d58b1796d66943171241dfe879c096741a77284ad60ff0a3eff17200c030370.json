  "title": "Who Owns the Fourth of July?",
  "text": "<p>Last Fourth of July, the U.S. was stumbling through the sixth month of the coronavirus pandemic. The guidance given then by \"the science\" was to abandon your job or business and go home.</p><p>The federal government and most governors took the advice of science to shut down the U.S. economy until . . . in fact, science and politics had no good answer on the \"until\" part. But in the interest of the common good and self-preservation, most people complied with the unprecedented quarantining of American life and commerce.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the wake of George Floyd's May murder, the social and political life of the country exploded. Hundreds of U.S. cities experienced protests, often organized by a then-obscure group called Black Lives Matter.</p><p>Some of the protests were peaceful. Some were not and descended into mob violence that destroyed the businesses of innocent shopkeepers, often black Americans or first-generation immigrants.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to last year's Fourth of July -- since 1776 always a time of planning for patriotic parades -- a significant slice of the U.S. political left decided the moment had arrived to deface statues and monuments dedicated to the country's most revered figures. Among those hauled down or hammered were George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, Thomas Jefferson, Ulysses S. Grant, Francis Scott Key, Christopher Columbus and Father Junipero Serra.</p><p>All were accused of racism of some sort. Indeed, the argument being made a year ago was that America was born not on the Fourth of July but in slavery in the early 17th century and that the country's defining characteristic for 400 years had been systemic or structural racism.</p><p>Between these waves in 2020 of death and rancor, we had a presidential election. The election ended in bitterness, but by November many people were so soaked in the nation's political recriminations that they could hardly react. The last straw was the January Capitol riot. Many wondered: Where is the United States going?</p><p>Ballast arrived late in the year when it came to light that as all this was going on, scientists at Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson had been spending their days doing something positive -- developing the vaccines that would deliver us from Covid-19. This, of course, was Operation Warp Speed -- a policy success originated by the Trump administration and currently under expropriation by the Biden White House.</p><p>Let it also not pass unnoticed that while much of the country stayed home as ordered, workers in hospitals, supermarkets, drugstores, factories, distribution centers and other places awoke each day, went to their jobs and kept the country afloat, oblivious to the political obsessions of their at-home fellow citizens.</p><p>Another notable source of stability, largely missed by a media focused on Covid and racism, was that for much of the pandemic's year, most of the nation's religious, private and many charter schools heroically stayed open while public-school unions refused to let their members teach.</p><p>\"Where is the country going?\" was a legitimate question in 2020. But the rapid development of vaccines and the traditions of conscientiousness and duty among many Americans made clear the U.S. remained tethered to solid ground.</p><p>Still, the swiftness of the social dislocation was extraordinary -- a national health crisis ran alongside protests and riots. It was a lot for the nation to absorb, and eventually the American public instinctively tried to right the ship.</p><p>One may say that Mr. Biden's thin victory over Donald Trump was driven by a desire for normalcy. But it didn't stop with choosing between those two candidates.</p><p>The search for a restored normal was evident in the outmigration of population from cities -- such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles -- by people frustrated with closures, protests and crime.</p><p>Unfazed, antiracism proponents pushed their demands -- and the public -- too far, too fast. A national movement has emerged among parents resisting school boards imposing hyperwoke curriculums without public debate.</p><p>But the most thought-provoking reset has to be the voting results in the Democratic mayoral primary in New York City, a presumed bastion of 2020's march to woke progressivism.</p><p>A five-borough map of voting by neighborhood on primary day for the top three candidates shows that defund-the-police candidate Maya Wiley and the Bidenesque Kathryn Garcia got most of their votes from the upper-income areas of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Meanwhile, pro-cop candidate Eric Adams overwhelmingly won the crime-beset black and Hispanic neighborhoods of the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Harlem in northern Manhattan.</p><p>The vote count is a mess but so far Mr. Adams is first. Who'd have thought New York City would become a testing ground for the national politics of post-pandemic America -- divided between people living woke and everyone else determined to live inside reality.</p><p>---</p><p>Write henninger@wsj.com.</p>",
