  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Even at 66% Effectiveness, J&J's Vaccine Is a Win --- The shot will play a key role in the public-health effort",
  "text": "<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson said Friday morning its vaccine was 66% effective in preventing moderate to severe disease in patients 28 days after vaccination. That headline result is well below what other manufacturers have reported in clinical trials and below the expectations of Wall Street analysts, who were generally hoping for 80% efficacy. Johnson &amp; Johnson shares sold off Friday, while Moderna and BioNTech shares were ripping higher. These market reactions makes some sense, as other manufacturers have reported efficacy north of 90%. Shares of upstart Novavax, which reported strong data of its own on Thursday, were up more than 60%.</p><p>Those more-effective vaccines will certainly have a major role going forward for high-risk patients and to protect against new virus strains that have worried public-health officials. The J&amp;J vaccine's efficacy puts it on par with a good version of a flu shot. The vaccine was generally safe and well-tolerated, which means regulators will likely authorize the shot for emergency use next month. Importantly, severe disease was reduced by 85% in the trial, J&amp;J said.</p><p>In a pandemic response, speed can be as useful as power. In the U.S., just 4.2 million people have received two vaccine doses, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.</p><p>Here, J&amp;J has a clear advantage: Their regimen is just one shot, while the other competitors require two. A more convenient offering makes convincing patients to take the shot less of a challenge. Just as important, the vaccine can be stored for months in an ordinary refrigerator. The J&amp;J shot can be readily administered in traditional settings like doctor's offices and pharmacies. And considering that demand for vaccines still vastly outstrips supply, large segments of the population, like younger and healthier patients, don't need the strongest possible protection right away.</p><p>Mass vaccinations with J&amp;J's efficacy profile wouldn't eradicate Covid-19 altogether. But considering the severe economic and social consequences of restricting normal daily life, outright eradication shouldn't be a prerequisite to opening schools and restaurants and expanding travel capacity. Alleviating the pressure on health-care systems and workers will make the risk of reopening far less scary, even if Covid-19 is still spreading.</p><p>As for J&amp;J, the company's strong business outlook for this year issued earlier this week didn't contemplate any Covid-19 vaccine revenues, and the stock is fairly valued. Look for Wall Street to quickly shake off any lingering disappointment.</p>",
