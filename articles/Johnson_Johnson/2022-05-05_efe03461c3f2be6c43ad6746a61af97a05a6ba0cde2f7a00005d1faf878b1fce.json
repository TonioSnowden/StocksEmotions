  "text": "<p>The change will likely sharply scale back use of a vaccine that health authorities had once hoped would be a convenient option for many people, but has become a third choice for most people because of the emergence of the risk for the rare but life-threatening side effect.</p><p>Due to the risk, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in December recommended that patients opt for one of the other vaccines over the Johnson and Johnson shot.</p><p>\"Our action reflects our updated analysis of the risk of TTS following administration of this vaccine and limits the use of the vaccine to certain individuals,\" said Peter Marks, who heads the FDA division responsible for regulating vaccines.</p><p>J&amp;J said it has updated the fact sheet for its vaccine to increase awareness of the clotting condition. \"Data continue to support a favorable benefit-risk profile for the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine in adults, when compared with no vaccine,\" the company said.</p><p>U.S. health authorities in April 2021 paused the use of J&amp;J's vaccine to investigate the clotting-condition risk.</p><p>FDA Limits Authorized Use of J&amp;J's Covid-19 Vaccine</p>",
