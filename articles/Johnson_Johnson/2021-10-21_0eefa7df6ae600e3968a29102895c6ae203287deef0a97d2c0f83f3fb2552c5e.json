  "text": "<p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel is meeting Thursday to weigh whether to support a vastly expanded booster campaign, a key step before the shots will be available to the public.</p><p>The meeting follows the Food and Drug Administration's authorization Wednesday of Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson booster shots. The agency also said people can get an extra dose that is different from the vaccine they received for their primary series.</p><p>The panel will review booster data for the Moderna and J&amp;J vaccines, as well as preliminary findings from a National Institutes of Health study on mixing and matching booster doses that are different from a person's primary series. The panel will also consider safety data about the boosters and the Covid-19 vaccines in general and will debate what recommendations to issue about the booster shots.</p><p>The CDC's signoff is the last step before the Moderna and J&amp;J boosters become available. While the FDA regulates medical products, the CDC offers guidance about the practice of medicine, and many vaccination sites have been following the agency's direction.</p><p>After its advisory panel votes, the CDC is expected to issue recommendations about who should get boosters and how many months people must wait before getting them.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How would you grade the vaccination campaign in your region? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The Biden administration has sought boosters to bolster vaccinated people's immune defenses, especially against the contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus.</p><p>The booster campaign has been rolling out in recent weeks, starting with extra doses of either the vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE or from Moderna for people with compromised immune systems.</p><p>Then last month,seniors and high-risk people began getting an additional dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least six months after they had finished getting the two-dose primary series.</p><p>Under the FDA's latest authorizations, all three approved vaccines now have a booster shot.</p><p>In addition, any adult who got a J&amp;J vaccine may get a booster from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or J&amp;J at least two months after the single-dose shot.</p><p>People who were initially vaccinated with a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine can get any booster at least six months after their second dose so long as they are seniors or at high risk because of underlying medical conditions or their workplace.</p><p>The shots will be free and available at pharmacies, doctors' offices and vaccination sites around the country. The U.S. will have enough shots to meet demand, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>The J&amp;J booster is the same dose as the first vaccine, and the Moderna booster, regardless of what vaccine a person received first, is half the dose as the first two shots.</p><p>The U.S. vaccine campaign is expected to continue to expand in the coming weeks. The FDA is expected to next clear Pfizer vaccines for children age 5 to 11 years old, and is also weighing whether to expand the booster campaign to people as young as 40 years old, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>More than 69 million people are fully vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine, and more than 15 million people have received the single-dose J&amp;J vaccine, according to the CDC.</p><p>Write to Felicia Schwartz at felicia.schwartz@wsj.com</p><p>Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson Covid-19 Boosters, Mixing and Matching Under Review by CDC Advisers</p>",
