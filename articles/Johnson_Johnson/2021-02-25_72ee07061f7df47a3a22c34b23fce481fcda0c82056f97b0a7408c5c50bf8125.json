  "title": "World News: Ghana First to Get Doses Under WHO Plan",
  "text": "<p>Funded mostly by rich Western governments, including the U.S., and charitable foundations, the Covax facility aims to ship two billion doses to developing countries this year, most of them free. Its backers say that should be enough to inoculate about 20% of the population of the world's 92 poorest economies and end what they call the acute phase of the pandemic.</p><p>Western countries have been criticized for buying up large stocks of vaccines, often enough to immunize their populations multiple times as they wait for different shots to pass clinical trials and be cleared by national regulators. Meanwhile, many developing nations -- dozens of them in Africa -- have yet to start administering any vaccines.</p><p>Over half of the more than 210 million doses administered globally were given in just two countries -- the U.S. and China -- and over 80% were in 10 mostly high-income nations, the WHO said this week. Secretary-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday hit out at rich governments continuing to seal bilateral vaccine deals with manufacturers that he said were cutting into supplies promised to Covax.</p><p>\"Before [high-income countries] ask the manufacturers . . . for additional vaccines, they should make sure whether their request affects the Covax deal or not,\" he said.</p><p>Shots from Covax will be free for the 92 poorest economies, including Ghana. About 50 other countries, including upper-middle-income nations such as Mexico and South Africa, also have ordered shots through the facility but will have to pay for their doses. That effort is likely to far outstrip vaccine donations from China, Russia and India, three nations that recently flew vaccines to numerous developing nations in what some experts say are attempts to gain political influence.</p><p>Covax has made deals with most of the big manufacturers, including Pfizer Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson and Novavax Inc. The majority of deliveries in the first half of the year will consist of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is cheaper than other shots and easier to store than the mRNA vaccines approved in the U.S. that need to be kept at very cold temperatures.</p><p>For 2021, the AstraZeneca vaccine is forecast to make up about one-third of Covax supplies, assuming that the shots by J&amp;J and Novavax and other manufacturers are authorized in the coming months. That reliance on the AstraZeneca vaccine has prompted some criticism after a small human trial and lab experiments showed the shot was likely less effective against a new virus strain that was first detected in South Africa. Experts say they are confident the shot will protect against severe cases from the variant.</p>",
