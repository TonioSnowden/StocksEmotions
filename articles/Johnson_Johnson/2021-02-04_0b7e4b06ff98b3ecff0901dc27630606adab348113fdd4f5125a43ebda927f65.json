  "title": "McKinsey to pay almost $574m to settle opioid claims by US states ",
  "text": "<p>McKinsey will have to pay almost $574m and has fired two partners as it announced a settlement of US states' claims that its advice to pharmaceutical companies contributed to the deadly opioid crisis.&#xa0;</p> <p>Under a settlement announced on Thursday with the attorneys-general of 49 states, the District of Columbia and several US territories, the consultancy did not admit wrongdoing or liability. </p> <p>Instead, the states acknowledged its “good faith and responsible corporate citizenship” in reaching a settlement in which it agreed to retain documents relating to its opioids work and adopt new policies on disclosing conflicts of interest between corporate and government clients.&#xa0;</p> <p>The partners that McKinsey terminated had discussed in emails from 2019 — which were disclosed in the litigation — conversations with its risk committee about “eliminating all our documents and emails”.</p> <p>“We deeply regret that we did not adequately acknowledge the tragic consequences of the epidemic unfolding in our communities,” said Kevin Sneader, McKinsey's global managing partner. The firm emphasised that it believed that its work had been lawful. </p> <p>In a letter to employees, Mr Sneader said the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8441f057-de28-4f8d-8281-c054433ee0f5\">settlement with every state</a> except Nevada had avoided a long legal process and marked “an important step in accepting the consequences of a chapter in our firm's story about which I am not proud”.</p> <p>McKinsey still needed to set higher standards for itself and for its profession, he said.</p> <p>McKinsey will pay almost $559m over four years to the states to fund opioid prevention, treatment and recovery programmes, and a further $15m to the National Association of Attorneys General to cover states' investigation costs and fund a document repository.</p> <p>“This is the first multistate opioid settlement to result in substantial payment to the states to address the epidemic,” the Massachusetts attorney-general's office said in a statement announcing the settlement.</p> <p>The sum far exceeds the fees McKinsey earned for its advice to opioid manufacturers. </p> <p>The authorities had brought the civil claims after details emerged of McKinsey's advice to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8112c484-c8f9-49f8-8d6d-bffeff9ccb59\">Purdue Pharma</a>, owned by members of the billionaire Sackler family, on how to boost sales of OxyContin, its potent prescription opioid.&#xa0;</p> <p>Its consultants had urged Purdue directors to consider whether to “turbocharge the sales engine”, according to a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/5715954-Massachusetts-AGO-Amended-Complaint-2019-01-31.html\">lawsuit</a> brought by the Massachusetts attorney-general, encouraging them to direct sales representatives to visit doctors with a record of prescribing large amounts and pitching opioids as giving patients “the best possible chance to live a full and active life”.</p> <p>“McKinsey's cynical and calculated marketing tactics helped fuel the opioid crisis by helping Purdue Pharma target those doctors they knew would overprescribe opioids,” New York attorney-general Letitia James said on Thursday. “They knew where the money was coming from and zeroed in on it.”</p> <p>In December, McKinsey pushed back on the idea that it had sought to worsen the public health crisis but admitted that it “fell short” of its responsibility to take account of the possible consequences of its work.</p> <p>“The partners who tried to cover up their actions placed profit over responsible behaviour and acted reprehensibly,” said Phil Weiser, the Colorado attorney-general who led the states' settlement negotiations. He added that McKinsey was the first company to work with states “to fix the problem rather than deny their conduct”, providing a model for other companies to follow.</p> <p>The consultancy has long pitched itself as a trusted adviser to the world's largest companies, several of which are run by McKinsey alumni. </p> <p>Its reputation has taken a series of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2db2a6d-693a-49e4-87e2-194183e6445b\">costly hits</a> over unrelated assignments that have prompted it to issue a new code of conduct, strengthen internal controls and review how it chooses which clients to take on.</p> <p>The settlement failed to satisfy several critics, with Tom Peters, the management writer who left McKinsey in 1981, writing on Twitter that he believed directors of the consultancy should be required to donate three-quarters of their net worth to “opioid curative causes”.</p> <p>Purdue agreed last October to pay more than $8bn in a criminal and civil settlement with the US Department of Justice. The company remains in negotiations with several states, counties and cities. Sackler family members agreed to pay $225m while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba099974-71f3-4b3c-9295-f6c3e6c4fa27\">denying the allegations</a> against them.</p> <p>McKinsey has also come under fire for its past advice to other drug manufacturers, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4eddc22-cd86-11e9-99a4-b5ded7a7fe3f\">previously made opioids</a> and owned an opioid ingredient maker. </p> <p>The consultancy had already stopped work on “any opioid-specific business” in 2019. Thursday's settlement prevents it from advising companies on “potentially dangerous Schedule II and III narcotics”.</p> <p>“With this agreement, we hope to be part of the solution to the opioid crisis in the US,” Mr Sneader said. </p> <p>According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of deaths each year from overdoses involving prescription opioids rose fourfold between 1999 and 2018. More than 232,000 Americans died from prescription opioid overdoses in that period.<br></p><p>Source: Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson in New York 2021 'McKinsey to pay almost $574m to settle opioid claims by US states ' FT.com 4 February.
