  "text": "<p>Russia said it had begun <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8813a840-3433-4a33-8fec-eb17841c027f#post-de47111d-6256-4a86-9a7f-de0267cd0af3\">a new phase of its invasion of Ukraine</a> as it stepped up an offensive for control of the Donbas, an eastern border region that has partly been taken over by Russian separatists.</p> <p>Foreign minister Sergei Lavrov told the India Today TV channel: “Another stage of this operation is beginning and I am sure this will be a very important moment of this entire special operation.”</p> <p>Though president Vladimir Putin has claimed Russia's goal was to take over the Donbas all along, Russian forces only withdrew from central Ukraine in late March after failed attempts to take major cities including Kyiv, the capital. </p> <p>Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky warned a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5ab2805-8cb8-4f09-be18-b4c544fbb4c9\">major new offensive</a> had begun in a late-night TV address and vowed that Ukraine would defend itself. “We will fight. We won't give up anything Ukrainian,” he said.</p> <p>A US defence official said yesterday that Russia had added thousands of troops to units in southern and eastern Ukraine over the past several days in preparation for the Donbas offensive.</p> <p>John Kirby, Pentagon press secretary, said Russian forces were “shaping and setting the conditions for future offensive operations” before last night's comments by Zelensky.</p> <p>The US would also begin training some Ukrainian forces outside of the country to use howitzers, an official said. The most recent $800mn US aid package includes 18 155mm howitzers and 40,000 155mm artillery rounds, according to the Pentagon.</p> <p>Sergei Shoigu, Russia's defence minister, said today that Ukraine's western backers were dragging out the conflict by supplying more weapons, according to the Russian news agency Interfax.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Currency and bond markets:</strong> The yen extended <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09de8213-e6c8-44de-895a-844a38a114c0\">its unbroken slide</a> into a 13th day, ratcheting up the stakes ahead of next week's Bank of Japan policy meeting. US inflation-adjusted bond yields were on the verge of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/300de65b-e3de-463b-975f-9d25f1c28783\">turning positive</a> for the first time since March 2020.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Energy markets:</strong> Can the EU give up Russian gas?

Here's the rest of today's news — Gordon.</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. US will not enforce travel mask mandate after legal defeat</strong> Just days after a mandate forcing passengers to wear face masks was extended a US judge <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f18e7af-6d60-41f3-9218-532c217ffebc\">ruled it unlawful</a>. The Biden administration said it was considering an appeal against the decision by Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, who was appointed by former president Donald Trump. </p> <p><strong>2. Chinese tech stocks tumble</strong> Chinese tech stocks slid today, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8813a840-3433-4a33-8fec-eb17841c027f#post-f76fc721-9410-4c89-acf4-e60380e003cb\">as markets reopened</a> after the news that Beijing had tightened regulations on the country's lucrative livestreaming industry. The National Radio and Television Administration of China on Friday banned the streaming of unauthorised games on public livestreams.</p> <p><strong>3. US natural gas prices hit 13-year high </strong>The price of US natural gas jumped <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8813a840-3433-4a33-8fec-eb17841c027f#post-140db8c1-e8a8-48f4-acb6-266a49284d56\">to its highest level since 2008</a>, driven by hot demand for American exports and forecasts for an extended spell of cold weather. Prices have marched higher in recent months as the Russian invasion of Ukraine has forced European consumers to turn to American liquefied natural gas. A prolonged winter in large parts of the US and Canada has also helped drive up demand.</p> <p><strong>4. World's second-biggest EV battery maker signs $9bn Indonesia supply deal</strong> A South Korean consortium <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a5b1cfb-bc18-44c4-8600-df2d7d6c8b14\">will invest $9bn in Indonesia</a> to build a mines-to-manufacturing electric vehicle supply chain, as battery makers look to reduce their reliance on Chinese suppliers and mitigate commodity price rises following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p><strong>5. Marine Le Pen rejects reports of EU funds misuse </strong>French far-right presidential challenger Marine Le Pen has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26dca79e-5a87-4b34-95d8-ba9178c00ce2\">dismissed allegations</a> that she misappropriated EU funds as “dirty tricks”, less than a week away from the final round of a tight election race against Emmanuel Macron.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>IMF World Economic Outlook </strong>The IMF will publish its latest medium-term outlook for the global economy, a day after the World Bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63c9b1fd-c084-4328-a5f4-485844d335df\">cut its 2022 global growth forecasts</a>. </p> <p><strong>Earnings</strong> Pharmaceuticals bellwether Johnson &amp; Johnson will report first-quarter earnings. Streaming service Netflix and oil services company Halliburton also report results. </p> <p><strong>Johnson faces UK parliament</strong> A defiant Boris Johnson will face MPs for the first time since being fined over the “partygate” affair. The UK prime minister will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d24616c-5936-456d-ad43-904e7491b84b\">apologise</a> but is expected to insist that he was not aware he was breaking his own Covid-19 lockdown rules.</p> <p><em>Our latest newsletter, </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51dcba2d-234e-42d8-b0c7-ac1c0f9bc9f5\"><em>Inside Politics</em></a><em>, launches today. Join us every weekday morning for insider analysis of the latest political news, plus polls and a dose of culture — all written by our new columnist Stephen Bush. </em></p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Pandemic accelerates fall in China's birth rate</strong> Before the pandemic, China was already the centre of the global baby bust, but the fall in birth rates <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1389fba-ffd6-474e-8eed-ac9198453e94\">has accelerated</a> in the two years since the virus struck. Just 10.6mn babies were born in China last year, the&#xa0;lowest number&#xa0;recorded since the Communist party took power in 1949.</p> <p><strong>Asian Americans take safety into their own hands </strong>Since the pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6322582d-b119-49ff-ac6c-c9345d0b8e49\">anti-Asian hate in the US has escalated</a>. Amanda Chu speaks to Asian Americans in New York, where the police estimate that hate crimes against them jumped more than 360 per cent in 2021.</p> <p><strong>Patriots vs globalists </strong>It was France that gave the world the concepts of the left and right in politics, Gideon Rachman writes. Now it is France that is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2a1f0eb-cb31-4f7c-a445-f06ff0974942\">leading the way</a> in the destruction of this divide and its replacement by a new politics, dominated by nationalists and internationalists.</p> <p><strong>US-China Tech Race: Shock and Awe </strong>In the latest episode of the Tech Tonic podcast, the FT's US-China correspondent Demetri Sevastopulo <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46095822-70ec-450b-9b50-6d3e52293247\">tells the inside story</a> of his scoop on China's secret hypersonic weapon test and how it changed geopolitics.</p> <p><strong>Dutch warehouses offer Brexit relief</strong> While the UK government launches a search for Brexit opportunities, one group has already discovered them: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60cedff7-79a8-4595-8ba0-84de2457db1b\">Dutch warehouse owners</a>. British-based companies are flocking to the Netherlands as they struggle with disruptions.</p> <h1>Fashion</h1> <p>Hard luxury drives the retail market because watches and jewellery tend to retain, or even increase, their value. Historically, clothing has been a poor investment, losing about 90 per cent of its value at the point of purchase. But a boom in online retail and changing attitudes towards pre-owned have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27a4eb80-f416-498a-9bc8-26aa030da9ff\">given rise to vast online marketplaces</a> for second-hand goods.</p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, George Russell and Emily Goldberg 2022 'FirstFT: Russia begins new offensive in Ukraine's east' FT.com 19 April.
