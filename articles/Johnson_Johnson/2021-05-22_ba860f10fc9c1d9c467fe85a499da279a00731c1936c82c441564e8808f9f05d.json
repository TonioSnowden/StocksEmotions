  "title": "U.S. News: More Shots Mean More Wasted Doses --- CDC says vaccinating people should be the priority over ensuring entire open vial is used",
  "text": "<p>\"As access to Covid-19 vaccine increases, it is important for providers to not miss any opportunity to vaccinate every eligible person who presents at vaccine clinics,\" the new CDC guidance said.</p><p>Many health workers and state officials had already been saying that vaccinating people should be the priority over ensuring every dose in an open vial is used.</p><p>\"If you have someone in front of you who needs a vaccine, go ahead and use what you've got and try to use it as best you can and as efficiently as you can. But we know that we're at a point where there will be some wastage that is unavoidable. We've got to get people vaccinated now,\" said Thomas Dobbs, state health officer for Mississippi.</p><p>As part of the effort to reach the unvaccinated, authorities are aiming to send vaccines to smaller settings, such as doctor's offices and pop-up clinics. Rather than vaccinating hundreds or thousands of people a day, a site might vaccinate tens of people, or fewer. However, bulk packaging, ideal for mass-vaccination sites, might lead to more wasted doses at smaller clinics.</p><p>The Covid-19 vaccines made by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., and Johnson &amp; Johnson have different handling requirements, storage protocols and guidelines for thawing and timing doses.</p><p>Generally, the more doses in the vials, the more potential for waste. J&amp;J vials contain five doses, and Pfizer vials contain six doses. Moderna vials contain about 10 doses, but the company was allowed last month to begin filling vials with as many as 15 doses.</p><p>Once punctured, multidose vials must be used within 12 hours for the Moderna vaccine, six hours for the Pfizer-BioNTech one, and two to six hours for J&amp;J's shot depending on how it is stored.</p><p>Moderna didn't respond to a request for comment. Johnson &amp; Johnson said its vaccines provide protection with just one shot and are easily transportable. Pfizer will start shipping its six-dose vials in smaller bundles at the end of the month, a company spokesman said.</p><p>At Clinica Medicos in Chattanooga, Tenn., where Kelly Rodney Arnold and other family physicians cater to a difficult-to-reach Latino population, the wait list on hand for extra shots has dried up. They are grabbing people for shots when they come in for other reasons, such as medication refills, prenatal visits or immigration physicals.</p><p>\"Before, the demand was so high and the scarcity seemed so real that the focus was: not a wasted dose. Now the mentality has shifted to: not a missed opportunity,\" she said.</p><p>The CDC has said it hopes to maintain wastage below 2% of total doses delivered. Most states are reporting wasted doses far below that number, with a national wastage rate of 0.4%, as of Thursday. That is concerning some health officials who think that at this stage of the rollout, some waste should be acceptable.</p><p>In North Carolina, where just 0.3% of doses have been wasted so far, the state says that vaccinating people should take precedence over using every dose in a vial.</p><p>To discourage vaccine hoarding, Texas stopped posting weekly vaccine waste information this month out of concern it might publicly shame people who needed to waste doses in order to get shots in arms. \"We have prioritized vaccinating a person over saving doses. We would not want providers to be looked at negatively for following our guidance,\" a spokeswoman said.</p><p>Health authorities are grappling with what level of wastage might be acceptable, given that vaccines remain a scarce global resource.</p><p>\"There's going to be more thrown-away doses. And that's a real tragedy,\" said Sean Valles, director of the Center for Bioethics and Social Justice at Michigan State University. \"But it's not like that dose sitting inside a CVS was going to go to India. That's not how it works.\"</p><p>The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, or Astho, is working with federal officials to see whether vaccine manufacturers might pack the shots in smaller allotments to limit potential waste, said Marcus Plescia, the organization's chief medical officer. Single-dose syringes would be ideal, but vials with fewer doses would also be a solution, he said.</p>",
