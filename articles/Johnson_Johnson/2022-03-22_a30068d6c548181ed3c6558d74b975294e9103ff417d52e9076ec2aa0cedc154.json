  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis: Agriculture Giants Stay, Cite Humanitarian Need",
  "text": "<p>Advocacy groups and employees of some agricultural companies have urged executives of businesses still operating in Russia to pull back further, however, and last week Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called for continued pressure on Western companies to exit Russia.</p><p>Companies in other industries, such as drugs and consumer products, also have cited humanitarian grounds for their decisions to keep operating certain parts of their business in Russia. Those include Johnson &amp; Johnson and AmerisourceBergen Corp., which said it stopped doing new business in Russia, though it will keep distributing certain cancer drugs and finish clinical trials.</p><p>Agricultural companies' ongoing operations in Russia could have broader effects on global food supplies. Russia's war in Ukraine involves two of the world's major grain-producing powers, upending a region that has become increasingly critical to feeding a growing and more affluent global population. A dent in Russian exports of food commodities, in addition to the likelihood of a diminished harvest in Ukraine, could lead to serious food shortages world-wide, analysts said.</p><p>\"It's creating quite an angst in the coming production cycle,\" said Bill Biedermann, the Tennessee-based co-founder of AgMarket.net, a commodity brokerage and agricultural consulting company. \"If it doesn't perform, there's only a couple times in recent history I can think where world food supplies would be this critical.\"</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has helped send wheat prices more than 30% higher during the past month. While sanctions haven't directly targeted Russian food exports, and ports in the country are operating, importers face high insurance costs to book cargoes from there, said Andrey Sizov, managing director of SovEcon, a research firm focused on Black Sea grain markets.</p><p>If crop suppliers pull out of Russia and the country cuts its production, Russia likely would have enough grain to feed itself, Mr. Sizov said, but not necessarily other countries.</p><p>\"That's a problem for Russia but a bigger problem for food importers all over the world,\" he said.</p><p>Other factors are likely to cut into wheat production, analysts said. Dry weather in South America is hurting crop production in the region. In the U.S., the Agriculture Department said earlier this month that it expects farmers to plant only slightly more wheat than last year, when the fewest acres were sown in more than a century. Lower U.S. yields are anticipated because of continuing drought in the West and Northern Plains.</p><p>Advocacy groups say Russia's war requires a powerful message, and agriculture companies need to do their part. Some Ukrainian and U.S. environmental and agricultural organizations penned a letter last week pressing Cargill to exit Russia completely. \"Doing business with and paying taxes to President Putin's government is fueling Russia's war machine,\" the letter said.</p><p>A Cargill spokeswoman pointed to the potential food-security implications outlined by the World Food Program, a United Nations agency, when responding to why the company is keeping essential food operations going. The U.N. agency notes the conflict could exacerbate food inflation and hunger in some of the world's poorest countries.</p><p>Cargill, which employs roughly 2,500 people in Russia, said earlier this month that it plans to continue running its food and animal feed facilities there, though it will scale back some operations and halt further investments.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
