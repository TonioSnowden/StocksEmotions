The plan would not only save millions of lives but also boost global GDP by $9tn by 2025, the IMF says in the report launched today at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ef3d1a8-6141-42d8-8063-62efcc8baf83\">G20 health summit</a> in Rome. </p> <p>A separate report from <a href=\"https://www.savethechildren.org.uk/news/media-centre/press-releases/rich-countries-60p-a-week-per-citizen-covid-vaccines-poor-countries\">Save the Children</a> says the G7 can collectively avoid £35 in economic losses for every £1 invested in global vaccination.</p> <p>Although programmes are well advanced in much of the richer world, in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2a47c7e-0b00-4e31-92ab-cd3ff0b9070b\">Africa</a> some countries have yet to vaccinate more than 1 per cent of their populations. New coronavirus cases in some parts of the world are also at some of the highest levels since the start of the pandemic. </p> <p>The need for urgent action was underlined by news that the UN's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f38b956-9eaf-4026-99ee-b7887e38dd16\">Covax scheme</a>, which aims to ensure poorer countries get their fair share of jabs, would not get any more supplies from India's Serum Institute, the biggest vaccine manufacturer in the world and the project's biggest supplier, before the end of the year. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e71d01f-d825-4642-8071-99f547aacc3f#post-c429e7c0-09ff-478b-8f8b-de8ab27680f7\">Gavi</a>, the public-private vaccine alliance, said it would buy 200m jabs from Johnson &amp; Johnson to make up some of the shortfall.</p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p>Soaring <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1ee290c-851d-41fb-8205-5615d211cd87\">retail sales</a> and growing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32421d08-9228-4e7a-a98b-a6f5ba7ae6f1\">consumer confidence</a> are the latest signs of a strong comeback for the <strong>UK economy</strong>. Economics editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52adf0da-f7fb-45e6-ba16-6ec039ed7b4a\">Chris Giles</a> says chancellor Rishi Sunak may now be able to invest in public services that have been hit hard by the pandemic and even cut taxes before the next general election. </p> <p>There were also more signs of a bounceback in the <strong>eurozone</strong> today as initial figures showed IHS Markit's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8208eca-3932-4783-b8a5-23e82e198223\">purchasing managers' index</a> rising from 53.8 in April to 56.9 in May, a three-year high. The European Central Bank's chief economist separately played down <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc577cc7-2cc9-4eb7-a9bd-5777f201ae8f\">fears of inflation</a> and indicated the bank would keep its ultra-loose monetary policy. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cba63fdd-b10b-4893-812a-d7968670e343#post-dd50c4c1-d115-4103-b15a-50bcd81cc2e7\">World Health Organization</a> warned however that Europe's progress against Covid-19 was still “fragile”. </p> <p>Despite earlier gloomy forecasts from the World Bank, <strong>remittances</strong> from overseas workers to developing countries have proved resilient, says economics correspondent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da4eddd6-ec7f-46b9-8339-553a0db3b935\">Delphine Strauss</a>. Stimulus policies in host countries and growing global demand mean migrants have been able to send home almost as much as ever. </p> <h1>Business</h1> <p><strong>Uefa</strong>, European football's governing body, put the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1ef328e-5e2c-4d8f-9361-cc50f46cdeaa\">pandemic damage</a> to clubs at €9bn in lost revenues while the English Premier League, the world's richest domestic competition, said it had suffered a hit of £2bn for two wrecked seasons. A “new financial reality” for the game ends a golden decade of 80 per cent rises in revenues at top European clubs between 2010 and 2019. </p> <p><strong>Luxury goods</strong> companies remain optimistic despite some serious damage from the pandemic. Clothing company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cba63fdd-b10b-4893-812a-d7968670e343#post-bba6b030-1e41-4a01-867a-801af7393579\">Ralph Lauren</a> said consumers would grasp the chance of its “inclusive” luxury after a year of pain, while <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/757ec967-385e-416e-bcfa-1ba53040b37a\">Watches of Switzerland</a> said sales would pass £1bn this year, although tourism-business would “never be the same again”. <em>You can view sessions from this week's FT Business of Luxury summit </em><a href=\"https://luxuryglobal.live.ft.com/agenda\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Innovation editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b7bb515-ef46-4596-8e70-bde2d5bd7020\">John Thornhill</a> examines the new age of global <strong>entrepreneurship</strong> that has taken off during the pandemic as high-achieving graduates find many more opportunities than usual to found start-ups.</p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72ae88cd-bcbf-4779-ae2a-c743b09c8b73\">European equities</a> rose on the PMI data showing the <strong>eurozone</strong> was springing back from its double-dip recession while US stocks also looked set to finish higher as investors digested the news that the Federal Reserve would discuss ending its pandemic monetary support. The price of gold, seen as a hedge against inflation, hit $1,879 an ounce, its highest level since January. </p> <p>Institutional investors need to cut <strong>chief executives</strong> some slack, argues companies editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/companies/the-top-line\">Tom Braithwaite</a> as revolts in the US and the UK grow against the size of CEO packages at a time of pandemic. Shareholders would be better off targeting “those who deliver mediocre performance year in year out with a high-six or low-seven figure package that is just low enough to keep the pitchforks at bay”, he says.</p> <p>The <strong>Central Bank of Ireland</strong> has told asset managers to review <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d9077a0-1342-4703-b47b-24989c8ad816\">liquidity management</a> to avoid a rerun of last year's crisis when dozens of funds seized up as the pandemic threw markets into chaos. Ireland is home to many of the world's biggest investment managers, which use the country as a base to sell across the EU. </p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p>MonsieurJon comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51c5e7d9-9e48-40c9-bf12-9a37425ef3f6?commentID=5b16a9d4-2902-4f3e-a71a-13216a2d96e9\">Britain's pubs and restaurants are already suffering the reopening blues</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Food courier economics seem (from previous FT articles) to mean charging restaurants 30 per cent of the price. Restaurant owners I have spoken to had to turn, with gritted teeth, to delivery companies during lockdown, usually passing on this cost to consumers, but it's hard to see it continuing when normal service resumes. From the consumer perspective we all know that getting a delivery is not a true substitute for going out. I'm optimistic that dining numbers will be sustained after the initial post lockdown rush.</p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>“We should think much more about making the right kind of pilgrimages, we should make them less often, but we shouldn't give up on them.” Despite the many flaws of modern tourism, it's right to revive the industry, argues travel editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd66019e-d960-4187-968f-ca2206081f30\">Tom Robbins</a>.</p><p>Source: Darren Dodd 2021 'Rich nations urged to underwrite vaccinations in poorer countries' FT.com 21 May.
