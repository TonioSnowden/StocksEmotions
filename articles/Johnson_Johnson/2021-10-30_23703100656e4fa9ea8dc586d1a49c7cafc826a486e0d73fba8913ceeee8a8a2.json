  "title": "U.S. News: FDA Approves Shot For Young Children",
  "text": "<p>The inoculation works safely, the FDA said. After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention signs off, expected within days, young children can begin getting their first dose.</p><p>The children will be given two shots three weeks apart, the same schedule as adults and adolescents, although each shot will contain one-third of the dosage.</p><p>\"Our comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the data pertaining to the vaccine's safety and effectiveness should help assure parents and guardians that this vaccine meets our high standards,\" said acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock.</p><p>White House and company officials expect there will be plenty of supplies available to immunize anyone who wants it, although probably not immediately at every site.</p><p>Pfizer will begin distributing the pediatric shots on Saturday now that the FDA has granted permission for use. The first shipment will total 15 million doses.</p><p>The U.S. says it has purchased more than 65 million pediatric doses, sufficient supply to cover all the eligible children. There are 28 million 5- to 11-year-olds in the U.S.</p><p>State and public-health officials have been scrambling to prepare doctors' offices and pharmacies to administer the shots, as well as new sites such as schools and museums.</p><p>The Pfizer-BioNTech shot has been authorized for people 16 years and older since December and cleared for those 12 years and older since May.</p><p>\"This is a day so many parents, eager to protect their young children from this virus, have been waiting for,\" said Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla.</p><p>The FDA didn't permit the shot's use in younger children earlier than now because their age group was among the last to be tested, frustrating many parents. Pediatricians and vaccine experts say inoculating the young children will be key to ending the pandemic.</p><p>While health experts say the children are much less likely to develop severe Covid-19 or die from the disease in comparison with adults, more have been hospitalized in recent months than earlier in the pandemic.</p><p>Children 5 to 11 years old make up 39% of Covid-19 cases in people younger than 18, according to the CDC. About 8,300 youngsters have been hospitalized, and 146 5- to 11-year-olds died from the disease, the CDC said. Around two-thirds of the hospitalized children had underlying health conditions, the agency said.</p><p>Immunizing the youngsters also could help curb transmission to people of older ages, according to the health experts.</p><p>In the study that was the basis for authorization, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was found to be safe, tolerable and 90.7% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19, according to the FDA and the companies.</p><p>Health authorities expect availability of the shots will trigger an initial surge in sign-ups by parents who have been waiting for months to inoculate their young children. Some 27% of parents said they would vaccinate their children right away, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey conducted this month.</p><p>Yet an even larger number of parents are expected to hold off, at least for now. About a third of the surveyed parents said they plan to wait and see before vaccinating their children, while 30% said they didn't plan to at all.</p><p>Given the hesitancy, health experts say authorities will have to work with many parents to encourage them to get their children vaccinated.</p><p>Among the concerns of many parents is an inflammatory heart condition called myocarditis found in small numbers of people, especially teenage and young adult males, who have taken messenger RNA vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech's.</p><p>While no cases of myocarditis were found in the key study testing the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in 5- to 11-year-olds, the study was considered too small to detect the potential risk.</p><p>U.S. health authorities have said the risk of the condition appears highest in young men and male adolescents after their second dose. FDA staff, reviewing the application to authorize the vaccine in young children, said the overall benefits of immunization preventing Covid-19 hospitalizations outweigh the risks.</p><p>Moderna Inc. has said testing found its Covid-19 shot generally is safe and induced immune responses in children ages 6 to 11 years. Johnson &amp; Johnson has yet to study whether its vaccine works in young children.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
