  "text": "<p>“The definition of fully vaccinated has not changed,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said during a White House COVID-19 Response briefing on Tuesday.</p><p>“We are absolutely encouraging those who are eligible for a boost six months after those mRNA doses to get your boost, but we are not changing the definition of fully vaccinated right now,” Walensky continued.</p><p>See also: Tesla's $1,900 ‘Cyberquad' EV for kids has already sold out, restocked and sold out again</p><p>Currently, a person is considered fully vaccinated by the CDC two weeks after receiving the second dose of either the Pfizer PFE/BioNTech BNTX or Moderna MRNA vaccine, or two weeks after receiving the single dose the Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ shot.</p><p>https://twitter.com/westonblasi/status/1466083045656698890Walensky's comments indicate that a change to the organization's fully-vaccinated designation could happen in the future, but this isn't in its plans at the moment. The CDC has asked all eligible people to get boosted as SARS-CoV-2 variants like the omicron and delta variants have appeared.</p><p>Coronavirus Update: U.S. to tighten testing requirements for travelers in light of omicron variant, and analysts expected limited authorization of Merck antiviral</p><p>Chief medical advisor to the president Dr. Anthony Fauci echoed similar sentiments on COVID vaccine boosters last week during an interview with Reuters.</p><p>“Right now, officially, ‘fully vaccinated' equals two shots of the mRNA and one shot of the J&amp;J, but without a doubt that could change. That's on the table for discussion,” Fauci said.</p><p>See also: ‘This is not going to be good': Moderna CEO on what scientists are telling him about the omicron coronavirus variant</p><p>The omicron variant, which was first reported by scientists in South Africa, was declared a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organization (WHO) last week.

More specifics could come on Thursday, when President Joe Biden is set to give a speech on the country's plan to control the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>See also: Penn National, DraftKings highlight November slump for sports betting stocks</p><p>The first confirmed case of the Omicron variant was identified in the U.S. on Wednesday.</p><p>The global tally for confirmed cases of COVID-19 reached 263 million on Tuesday, and the death toll rose to 5.21 million, according to&#xa0;data from Johns Hopkins University.</p>",
