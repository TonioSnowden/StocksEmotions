  "text": "<p>Mario Draghi said his Italian government would launch a new economic package to support the country during fresh Covid-19 lockdown measures coming into force from next week amid a surge in cases.</p> <p>The prime minister said he would boost support for struggling workers and businesses, as well as tripling the number of vaccines being administered daily during a new lockdown that will last until the first week of April.</p> <p>“More than a year after the beginning of the health emergency, we are unfortunately facing a new wave of contagions,” Draghi said. “The memory of what happened last spring is alive, and we will do everything to prevent it from happening again.”</p> <p>Italy, which has suffered more than 100,000 deaths since the pandemic began, has in recent weeks experienced a sharp increase in cases as a result of the spread of the variant of Covid-19 first detected in the UK.</p> <p>Under the new measures, from Monday any Italian region that has more than 250 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over a seven-day period will be placed automatically under the strictest “red” restrictions. This means bars, restaurants and schools will close. Over the Easter holidays, all of Italy will be placed under these strict measures.&#xa0;</p> <p>At current infection levels, with Italy having reported 26,824 new cases on Friday, up from levels closer to 10,000 per day at the start of March, large swaths of the country are likely to face such restrictions, including Milan and possibly Rome.</p> <p>Draghi said additional support for the Italian economy during the lockdown would be announced next week. This would involve an increase to the €32bn in stimulus and support already budgeted for by the last government.</p> <p>He also said that Italy's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd60a722-2019-4094-a778-750a0e8a0931\">vaccination campaign</a> would be sped up, with the aim being to triple the number of shots administered from a current daily rate of 170,000. This increase, Draghi said, would be helped by the European Medicines Agency's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55f0ecff-5839-4809-9c74-d729e6060e00\">approval on Thursday</a> of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.</p> <p>Italians would be prioritised for vaccination by age and vulnerability. Those key workers yet to be vaccinated would also receive priority.</p> <p>Draghi added that his government would continue to block the exports of vaccines by companies that had delayed their deliveries. Earlier this month, Italy obtained EU backing to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bed655ac-9285-486a-b5ad-b015284798c8\">block a shipment</a> of 250,000 doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to Australia.</p> <p>“In recent weeks, we have taken strong decisions against companies in delay with deliveries,” he said. “We will continue to do so to defend the health of Italians.”</p> <p>Draghi also said Italy would continue to administer the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, in line with EMA recommendations. Some European countries <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6546f070-ea07-400b-b6a6-dab47a5e49a5#post-0dbe353b-e84d-4496-8214-688caba329f4\">suspended its use </a>on Thursday after a small number of people who received the jab experienced subsequent adverse health effects.</p> <p>He said the opinion of the Italian regulator was that “there is no evidence that these events are related to the administration of the vaccine”.</p><p>Source: Miles Johnson in Rome 2021 'Draghi announces new Italian lockdown and fresh support for economy' FT.com 12 March.
