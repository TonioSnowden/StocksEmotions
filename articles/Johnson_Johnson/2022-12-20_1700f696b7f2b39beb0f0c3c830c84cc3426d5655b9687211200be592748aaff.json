  "title": "Dow Edges Higher After Surprise Bank of Japan Adjustment; The yen jumps against the dollar while Treasury yields rally",
  "text": "<p>The major indexes on Tuesday broke a four-session losing streak. Out of the 11 sectors in the S&amp;P 500, consumer discretionary, consumer staples, healthcare and real estate traded lower. Energy and materials stocks were the biggest gainers.</p><p>The policy adjustment out of Japan took markets by surprise, with the meeting taking place toward the end of Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda's 10 years in office. Most central banks across the globe have already started tightening monetary policy to tame inflation and catch up to the U.S. dollar, with Japan one of the few outliers.</p><p>Though the BOJ's interest-rate increase is small compared with those made in the U.S., analysts and investors worry that this marks an end to the yearslong era of easy money everywhere.</p><p>Recent data has suggested the Federal Reserve's interest-rate increases are succeeding in tempering inflation, but Fed officials have signaled their intention to continue to raise rates and keep them elevated for longer than many investors had anticipated.</p><p>Yields rose on U.S. Treasurys, which have largely trended lower in recent weeks as inflation has shown signs of easing. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose to 3.683% from 3.581% on Monday.</p><p>Matt Brill, Invesco Fixed Income's head of North America investment grade, believes investors will turn to U.S. fixed income in 2023 because of the higher yields offered, but rising overseas yields might steer foreign bond investors elsewhere.</p><p>\"The concern is always, what will happen if local yields become more competitive with U.S. yields, and today's the first step of that?\" said Mr. Brill. \"The markets are wondering, where does it stop?\"</p><p>In stocks, Tesla shares fell $12.07, or more than 8%, to $137.80, with its market capitalization slipping below that of Johnson &amp; Johnson for the first time since late 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Several analysts have cut their price targets on Tesla stock in recent days.</p><p>Tech stocks such as Tesla are particularly sensitive to interest rates and have been some of the biggest drivers of this year's roughly 20% decline in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Next year \"could be the start of a bottoming process,\" said Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies and portfolio manager of the Fairlead Tactical Sector exchange-traded fund. Ms. Stockton thinks that defensive stocks, which have dominated this year, won't be as popular next year.</p><p>Shares of General Mills fell $3.99, or 4.6%, to $83.13. The food maker boosted its fiscal-year outlook, but pet-food sales were lower than Wall Street expected.</p><p>Investors are wondering if the U.S. economy will be strong enough to withstand further rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. \"We think that the Fed is likely going to run out of runway to continue to employ hawkish policy,\" said Gerald Goldberg, chief executive and co-founder at GYL Financial Synergies.</p><p>Until Tuesday, the Bank of Japan had employed ultraloose monetary policies for years. The BOJ has long intervened to keep its government-bond yields within a range near zero, indirectly helping to keep global borrowing costs down. That, in turn, made Japanese investors some of the biggest buyers of U.S. Treasurys over the years.</p><p>The yen rose 3.9% against the dollar, while the yield on Japan's 10-year government bonds jumped to 0.417%. They had previously been capped by the central bank at 0.25%.</p><p>The move also comes in a typically quiet period, when liquidity is low and markets are highly sensitive to surprises, said James Binny, global head of currency at State Street Global Advisors.</p><p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, added 0.2%, or 19 cents, to settle at $79.99 a barrel. Gold prices rallied 1.6%, or $28.20, to finish $1815.90 a troy ounce.</p><p>Asian indexes fell. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed down 2.5%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.3% and China's Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.1%. In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged down 0.4%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Hardika Singh at hardika.singh@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Edges Higher After Surprise Bank of Japan Adjustment</p>",
