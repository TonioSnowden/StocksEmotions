  "title": "This group of stocks is flagging a rebound, and that's good news for the S&P 500, says technical analyst",
  "text": "<p>Some of that positivity may come from the fact investors look ready to choose higher rates over higher inflation, with the former seen as less toxic for companies in the longer run, said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote.&#xa0;</p><p>While everything can change in a minute, investors might be wondering what it will take for the S&amp;P 500 to build on last week's 6% rally. Our call of the day, from MKM Partners' chief market technician, JC O'Hara, advises watching for signs of stabilization in areas that were first hit in the leg downward.</p><p>And biotech is fitting that theme, he said. “The S&amp;P 1500 Biotech group of stocks is bouncing exactly where it should.” He zeroes in on two charts, from Ionis Pharmaceuticals IONS and Moderna MRNA, the latter which is holding a vaccine day presentation for investors on Thursday.</p><p>It's not just biotech. “There are more and more pharmaceutical charts breaking out to new highs in a tape that saw plenty of bear market moves from individual names,” said O'Hara, as he flagged bullish charts from Bristol Myers Squibb BMY, Corcept Therapeutics CORT, Harmony Biosciences HRMY, Innoviva INVA, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, Eli Lilly LLY, and Pacira BioSciences PCRX.</p><p>O'Hara also likes European pharmaceutical stocks. “While geopolitical concerns remain front and center in Europe, pharma seems to be a good place to put capital to work.”</p><p>He sees bullish charts on the following names: ALK-Abello DK:ALK.B, AstraZeneca AZN, Bayer XE:BAYN, GlaxoSmithKline GSK , Ipsen FR:IPN, Novartis NVS, Novo Nordisk NVO , Roche CH:ROG, Sanofi SNY and UCB BE:UCB.</p><p>As for that 6% S&amp;P 500 rally last week, O'Hara said the most positive takeaway was a close above the key 4,400 level.</p><p>“The magnitude of the move was impressive, but the levels broken above are what we need to focus on,” said O'Hara, who noted other “bullish action,” such as the Russell 2000 RUT and Nasdaq 100 indexes COMP breaking above intermediate downtrends. And the Stoxx Europe 600 regained a level seen the day Russian launched its attack on Ukraine.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>Ukraine forces claim to have recaptured a key suburb in Kyiv, while the battle for Mariupol rages on and strategists say a stalemate situation is building.
