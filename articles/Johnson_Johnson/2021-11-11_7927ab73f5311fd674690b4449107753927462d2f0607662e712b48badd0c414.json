  "title": "Colorado Opens Covid-19 Boosters to Anyone Over 18; Gov. Jared Polis issues executive order declaring entire state as high risk for transmission",
  "text": "<p>The state's seven-day average of newly reported Covid-19 cases stood at 3,142 on Wednesday, up from 2,135 a month earlier, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.</p><p>Hospitalizations have also been increasing. More than 1,490 Covid-19 patients are currently hospitalized across Colorado, and 95% of intensive-care beds are occupied, Mr. Polis, a Democrat, said Thursday. The state Department of Public Health and Environment on Wednesday reactivated crisis standards of care for healthcare staffing, to help manage the influx of patients and allocate resources.</p><p>\"The Governor has been disappointed with the overly complex message from the CDC and the FDA on boosters and won't allow that to harm Coloradans who want the additional protection,\" said Conor Cahill, a spokesman for Mr. Polis.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration didn't immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.</p><p>The FDA currently limits booster shots from Moderna Inc. and from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE to those who are 65 years or older and adults who live or work in high-risk situations, or have special medical conditions. Anyone who received the single-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson shot is eligible for a booster at least two months later.</p><p>Under Mr. Polis's declaration, those who want to get a Moderna or Pfizer booster still have to wait six months after the second dose, as the FDA rules state.</p><p>The Biden administration has been looking at expanding the use of boosters to all adults, according to people familiar with the matter. Earlier this week, Pfizer and BioNTech asked U.S. health regulators to expand authorization of their Covid-19 booster to people as young as 18 years old.</p><p>More than 3.59 million Coloradans are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, or about 72.4% of the state's eligible population, according to state data. Around 629,882 people have received a booster dose, or 17.6% of fully vaccinated people, CDC data show.</p><p>Colorado Opens Covid-19 Boosters to Anyone Over 18</p>",
