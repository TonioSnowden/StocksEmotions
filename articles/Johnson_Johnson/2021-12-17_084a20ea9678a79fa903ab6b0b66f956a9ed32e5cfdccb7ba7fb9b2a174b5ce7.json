  "title": "U.S. News:  CDC Backs  Pfizer,  Moderna  Vaccines  Over J&J's  ----  By Peter Loftus",
  "text": "<p>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended adults take a Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. or Moderna Inc. over Johnson &amp; Johnson's after agency officials reported the rate of a rare but serious blood-clotting condition was higher than previously detected. </p><p>   The CDC made the move Thursday, following a 15-0 vote by advisers encouraging use of vaccines other than J&amp;J's. </p><p>   The agency noted similar recommendations have been made in other countries, including Canada and the U.K. People unable or unwilling to receive a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, the CDC said, will continue to have access to the J&amp;J vaccine. </p><p>   The updated position is likely to deal another blow to the use of the J&amp;J shot, whose uptake had been hurt by manufacturing issues and earlier reports of J&amp;J vaccine recipients, especially women, experiencing blood clots combined with low blood-platelet levels. </p><p>   There have been at least 54 cases of the condition, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS, among J&amp;J vaccine recipients in the U.S., including nine resulting in deaths, CDC officials said Thursday. </p><p>   The rate of cases is higher than previously estimated in men and women, and in a wider age range, the officials said. </p><p>   \"I just cannot recommend vaccines associated with a condition that may lead to death,\" said Pablo Sanchez, a pediatric infectious-disease specialist at the Ohio State University-Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio., who serves on the panel of CDC advisers. </p><p>   J&amp;J said it remained confident in the overall positive benefit-risk profile of its vaccine. \"The safety and well-being of those who use the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine continues to be our No. 1 priority,\" said Mathai Mammen, global head of J&amp;J's pharmaceutical research and development. </p><p>   He said the company will work with the CDC on next steps and strongly supports education about rare events such as TTS and how to manage it. </p><p>   J&amp;J's Covid-19 vaccine is based on a different technology than the messenger RNA used in the Pfizer and Moderna shots. </p><p>   J&amp;J's vaccine includes a harmless version of a virus that can cause the common cold, which is engineered to contain genetic instructions that set off an immune response. The mRNA vaccines don't contain any viral material and use a different way of delivering a genetic code that sets off an immune response. </p><p>   As of Aug. 31, CDC officials said at the advisers' meeting, about 3.8 cases of TTS were reported for every million doses of J&amp;J vaccine administered, across all recipients. The rate was highest among women ages 30 to 39, at 10.6 per million doses. </p><p>   CDC officials also said that among those who develop TTS, the fatality rate was about 15%. The people who died deteriorated quickly after being admitted to the hospital. CDC officials said getting J&amp;J's vaccine was still superior to not getting vaccinated, but the balance between the benefits and risks for the messenger RNA vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna was superior to J&amp;J's. And the current supply of mRNA vaccines in the U.S. is adequate, unlike earlier in the year. </p><p>   Health officials say people with an allergy to ingredients in the mRNA vaccines, or who have had a severe allergic reaction to a dose of those vaccines, shouldn't receive them. </p><p></p>",
