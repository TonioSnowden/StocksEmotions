  "text": "<p>The FDA on Wednesday night authorized the extra dose for people 65 years and older or at high risk of severe Covid-19, including those who work in healthcare, at grocery stores or are teachers.</p><p>\"Data are not available to inform the interchangeability of a booster dose of one vaccine with the primary series of another vaccine,\" Dr. Fink said at a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>Officials expect to have more information on this in the future. The National Institutes of Health said in June it is studying giving extra Moderna Inc. doses to people who have received Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson and the Moderna vaccines.</p><p>The FDA has said it needs more time to review use of extra doses of Moderna and J&amp;J Covid-19 vaccines.</p><p>The ACIP's recommendations will be a key step in making the Pfizer-BioNTech boosters available, as the CDC usually follows its guidance.</p><p>Some panel members asked about the risks of delaying a vote on Pfizer while waiting for data and an authorization for Moderna's vaccine so as not to privilege one group of vaccine recipients over another. They also expressed concerns about leaving behind people who receive the J&amp;J shot.</p><p>The ACIP is composed of physicians and other experts in infectious diseases, immunology and public health. It advises the CDC and develops recommendations for use of vaccines generally in the U.S. The CDC typically adopts its guidance, which then becomes formal CDC policy.</p><p>An FDA advisory panel last week recommended boosters for people 65 and older or those who are at high risk for developing severe Covid-19.</p><p>Write to Felicia Schwartz at felicia.schwartz@wsj.com and Jared S.
