  "title": "The Toshiba Split: A Farewell to Poor Japanese Management? Having shed inefficiencies since the 1990s, the corporate environment may be ready for reform.",
  "text": "<p>GE, J&amp;J and thousands of other American companies every day have to answer to investors demanding managerial competence in pursuit of higher returns. A diverse ecosystem of asset managers, activist investors, short sellers, law firms, accountants, consultancies, regulators and the like work to enforce accountability on management—not always immediately or wisely, but inevitably and ruthlessly.</p><p>Until very recently this was not the case in Japan, where the business ecosystem served primarily to protect management. The most obvious manifestation was the keiretsu system by which banks would organize around themselves a constellation of client-companies who all integrated each other into their supply chains and even owned one another's shares. But there were other factors, such as the government's internal resistance to any sort of regulatory shake-up, or law firms' discomfort with advising activist investors for fear of alienating corporate clients.</p><p>This has started to fall apart over the past 20 years or so. The main event has been the slow unraveling of the keiretsu system. It began in the 1990s with a near-catastrophic banking crisis, which led to new regulations concerning disposal of nonperforming loans that banks previously had overlooked for the benefit of their keiretsu companies, as well as new restrictions on cross-shareholding. Measuring by value, some 50% of large-company listed shares were tied up in cross shareholdings in 1989, according to veteran Japan investor and adviser Jesper Koll; by 2019 that had fallen to 4%. This has cleared a path for foreign investors to buy into Japan, with foreign ownership expanding to 31% of market value from 4% over the same span.</p><p>Japan Inc.'s new ownership has driven the government to belated regulatory action to match market reality. A new corporate-governance code introduced in 2015 sought to impose more accountability on corporate managers. More important, a so-called stewardship code implemented in 2014 created new fiduciary responsibility for domestic institutional shareholders.</p><p>The transformation in corporate behavior in response to these developments has been gradual up to now, as Hemingway might say. As recently as 2011, the keiretsu system still had some kick in it, coming to the rescue of Olympus, a maker of cameras and medical devices, when the company was engulfed in an accounting scandal. Despite considerable angst from minority shareholders, the company's main bank and major shareholder. Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., stepped in with its own slate of new managers to avert both collapse and any aggressive change in the business. Examples of companies undertaking considered and voluntary overhauls remain relatively few and far between, with Hitachi's slow-rolling rationalization of its sprawling corporate structure being the most prominent case.</p><p>But there seems to be no one coming to save Toshiba. The company has been embroiled in various scandals for roughly a decade, some to do with accounting and some to do with the government's meddlesome relationship with the company—all of which the world found out about, eventually, due to corporate Japan's improving transparency. But now, unlike other Japan Inc. fiascoes, the company's banks and domestic institutional shareholders don't appear to be willing or able to execute a rescue. The government, tarnished for its own supporting role in one of Toshiba's more recent governance scandals, may be too embarrassed to help management any more.</p><p>That leaves management at the mercy of activist shareholders who have acquired substantial stakes in the company. After years of dodging its own faults, Toshiba has suddenly found itself with nowhere to run.</p><p>Is the three-way split a good idea? Who knows? Skepticism certainly would be justified—investors have long complained that management isn't sufficiently attentive to their interests. Then again, perhaps the breakup will open the door to further negotiations for a more radical corporate and management overhaul down the road.</p><p>The activists aren't saying yet what they think of any of this, and ultimately it's their decision. This is itself a very new condition for Japan Inc., and one that holds out some hope for a revival, gradually or suddenly, in Japan's lagging economy.</p><p>The Toshiba Split: A Farewell to Poor Japanese Management?</p>",
