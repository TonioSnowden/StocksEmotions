  "title": "'Booster': A Bump Up From Below—For Your Immunity; The word we use for an extra dose of vaccine, enthusiastic advocacy or a child seat is an American original",
  "text": "<p>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.</p><p>This past week, the Food and Drug Administration approvedCovid-19 booster shots for people 65 and older and other high-risk adults, if they have already received two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The Biden administration had hopedto make booster shots available for all by Sept. 20, but the FDA is holding off on authorizing boosters for those who received the other two inoculations, made by Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p>In the context of vaccination, a \"booster shot\"—or \"booster\" for short—is simply an extra dose, which studies show can improve the immune system's defenses and ward off viral variants. People already get \"booster shots\" for such contagious diseases as polio, tetanus and whooping cough. The name implies that extra shots can \"boost\" immunity when the protection provided by initial doses begins to wane.</p><p>\"Booster\" is a word with all-American origins, going back to the use of \"boost\" for lifting someone or something by pushing up from below. But even though \"boost\" has been documented in American English since the early 19th century, its deepest roots are murky.</p><p>The earliest known examples of the term's use come from an 1801 play satirizingthe political factions of Connecticut called \"Federalism Triumphant.\" The anonymous playwright used \"boost\" as both a noun (\"We must give each faithful servant a boost\") and a verb (\"I would not boost his provision bill, unless he helped me\"). Another Connecticut play, \"The Yankey in England,\" published by David Humphreys in 1815, used the word similarly and even provided a definition in its glossary of Americanisms found in the production: \"boost: raise up, lift up, exalt.\"</p><p>Musing on the enigmatic roots of \"boost,\" University of Minnesota etymologist Anatoly Liberman observed, \"It must have lain dormant in dialectal use for a very long time and been brought to the New World by the colonists (we cannot even begin to guess when).\" He added, \"Why it slept so long will forever remain a mystery.\"</p><p>Mr. Liberman surmises that \"boost\" is historically connected to \"boast,\" with the shared concept of \"swelling and rising.\" Other theories relate the word to a use of \"boost\" in the Scots language for driving off an animal, or to \"boostering,\" which could mean \"bustling\" in some regional dialectsin England.</p><p>Regardless of where it originated, \"boost\" spread quickly in American usage, and soon the word \"booster\" came into use for a supporter of a particular cause. In 1871, President Ulysses S. Grant proposed to annex the Dominican Republic, and a commission set about investigating the proposal. A Vermont newspaper predictedthat the commission would be little more than \"a 'booster' for the annexation mirage.\" \"Booster clubs\" cropped up to raise funds for various organizations, and advocating in an overly enthusiastic manner came to be known as \"boosterism.\"</p><p>In the 20th century, \"booster\" developed some technical uses, including for a radio-frequency amplifier that boosts a signal. In aeronautics, \"booster\" was applied to the primary stage of a rocket or missile that imparts an initial burst of speed. And \"booster chairs\" or \"booster seats\" provideda liftfor young children starting in the 1940s.</p><p>The medical usage of \"booster doses\" or \"booster shots\" emerged around the same time. A 1942 article in the American Journal of Nursing explained that when an additional dose of a tetanus vaccine is administered, \"this so-called follow-up ('booster') dose of toxoid\" is enough to prevent the appearance of the disease.</p><p>With Covid-19 vaccines encountering resistance from \"anti-vaxxers,\" perhaps the shots can also claim a more supportive term: Let's call those in favor of giving out extra doses \"booster boosters.\"</p><p>'Booster': A Bump Up From Below—For Your Immunity</p>",
