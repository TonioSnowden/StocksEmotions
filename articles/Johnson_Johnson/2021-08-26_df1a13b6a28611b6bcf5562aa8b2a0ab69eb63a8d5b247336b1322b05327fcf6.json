  "title": "VC Daily: Venture Investors Back Neurogastrx Bid to Crack Gastrointestinal Market",
  "text": "<p>But startups aren't crowding into this market, largely because top pharmaceutical companies have been focusing more on other areas, such as cancer and inflammatory diseases, said Neurogastrx Chief Executive James O'Mara. That means startups seeking a corporate partnership have relatively few options.</p><p>Neurogastrx's strategy is to target diseases treated by doctors who specialize in gastrointestinal diseases, as opposed to conditions treated by the much-larger population of primary-care physicians. A small company can field a sales team capable of reaching specialists without help from a corporate partner, he said.</p><p>Neurogastrx is developing medicines for erosive esophagitis, or irritation and damage to the inner lining of the esophagus, the tube running from the throat to the stomach, and gastroparesis, in which movement of food from the stomach to the small intestine slows or stops.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Covid-19 pill.

Companies are launching studies of these medicines, called protease inhibitors, as Covid-19 cases have been rising, especially among the unvaccinated.</p><p>These companies are betting that drugs will be needed to complement vaccines because of breakthrough infections among the vaccinated and because many people are hesitant to get vaccinated.</p><p>‘It's really clear that we need more than vaccines to fight this pandemic.'</p><p>— Jim Tananbaum, chief executive of Foresite Capital, an investor in Pardes Biosciences Inc., a startup developing a pill to treat and prevent Covid-19.</p><p>‘Vaccinated' Badges Pop Up on All Sorts of Apps</p><p>More smartphone apps are adding features that let people display their Covid-19 vaccination status and search for other users and businesses that favor vaccines, Ann-Marie Alcántara reports. Dating app Grindr LLC said that starting in September, it will let users add their vaccination status to their profiles and filter their searches to find other vaccinated people. Vacation-home rental company Vrbo, part of Expedia Group Inc., this fall plans to enable hosts on its platform to share their requirements for renters to be vaccinated against, or tested for, Covid-19.</p><p>Biden Administration Likely to OK Covid-19 Boosters at Six Months</p><p>Federal regulators are likely to approve a Covid-19 booster shot for vaccinated adults starting at least six months after the previous dose rather than the eight-month gap they previously announced, a person familiar with the plans said, as the Biden administration steps up preparations for delivering boosters to the public, Stephanie Armour and Jared S. Hopkins report. Data from vaccine manufacturers and other countries under review by the Food and Drug Administration is based on boosters being given at six months, the person said. The person said approval for boosters for all three Covid-19 shots being administered in the U.S.—those manufactured by Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson —is expected in mid-September.</p><p>Industry News</p><p>Funds</p><p>Supermoon Capital launched with its inaugural $36 million fund to make early-stage investments in startups working on science-backed innovations aimed at improving sleep.
