  "text": "<p>\n  SALESFORCE.COM INC. </p><p>\n  CRM -6.3% </p><p>\n  Salesforce.com set its sights higher for 2021, but investors may need convincing. The business-software provider posted record sales and lifted its outlook for the current year on Thursday. Salesforce said its proposed acquisition of workplace messaging company Slack Technologies Inc. would help boost its top line for this fiscal year by about $600 million. But investors have been wary about the deal for Slack, which loses money. Salesforce shares have lost more than 10% since The Wall Street Journal first reported deal talks. Salesforce shares fell 6.3% Friday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  BEST BUY CO. </p><p>\n  BBY -9.3% </p><p>\n  The future is getting fuzzier at Best Buy. The electronics retailer said Thursday that sales surged in the holiday season but warned its torrid growth would slow this year. Best Buy plans to speed a digital transformation by shrinking its store workforce and using more space to fulfill online orders. The company has been laying off workers and cutting some workers' hours in recent weeks. Chief Executive Corie Barry said that some 5,000 workers were laid off or chose to take severance after their hours were cut during the last fiscal year. Best Buy shares fell 9.3% Thursday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  HOME DEPOT INC. </p><p>\n  HD -3.1% </p><p>\n  Two retail giants said the pandemic isn't ready to release its grip on their industry. A surge in home-improvement demand helped Home Depot's revenue increase 20% in its latest fiscal year, while annual sales at Macy's Inc. tumbled nearly 30%. Both sold more online. The retailers said these trends continue in 2021 but may change as vaccines roll out. Home Depot shares fell 3.1% Tuesday, and Macy's shares rose 3.9%. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON </p><p>\n  JNJ -2.6% </p><p>\n  A new Covid-19 vaccine is nearing the finish line. Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-dose Covid-19 vaccine was effective \"across demographic subgroups\" in a late-stage study, U.S. Food and Drug Administration scientists told medical specialists during a Friday meeting. The committee's meeting was the final step before U.S. health regulators decide on what would be authorization of a third vaccine, and the decision is expected Saturday. If the vaccine is authorized, J&amp;J has said it would deliver about 20 million doses for U.S. use by the end of March. Johnson &amp; Johnson shares fell 2.6% Friday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  ANHEUSER-BUSCH INBEV SA </p><p>\n  BUD -7.9% </p><p>\n  The hard seltzer craze is helping the world's biggest brewer keep sales frothy. Anheuser-Busch InBev said Thursday that sales at its \"beyond beer\" unit, which includes hard seltzer, ready-to-drink cocktails and other products, topped more than $1 billion in the latest quarter. Flavored alcoholic sparkling water emerged as one of the hottest parts of the booze market in recent years, coaxing more health-conscious drinkers away from beer. AB InBev launched Bud Light Seltzer early last year and recently rolled out Michelob Ultra Hard Seltzer. AB InBev shares lost 7.9% Thursday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  GAMESTOP CORP. </p><p>\n  GME +19% </p><p>\n  \"Meme\" stocks are still in play. GameStop shares jumped for a second day Thursday as momentum surrounding the stock continued to build. Thursday's gains stood in contrast with the rest of the market, as major stock indexes tumbled. The videogame retailer's recent rally is similar to last month's blockbuster gains, which were fueled by individual investors who touted the stock on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum and other social-media platforms. Other \"meme\" stocks, or ones that are popular on the Reddit forum, also jumped this week. GameStop shares surged 19% Thursday. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  DOORDASH INC. </p><p>\n  DASH +1.6% </p><p>\n  Demand for food delivery in a Covid-vaccinated world is expected to cool. DoorDash said Thursday its days of breakneck growth are ending, forecasting a major slowdown in new food orders for 2021 as vaccinations sweep the country and the economy crawls toward reopening. The company, which reported a larger-than-expected loss in the final quarter of 2020, expects total orders this year to increase as much as 33% -- a more modest pace than the triple-digit-percent growth rate in recent quarters. DoorDash shares added 1.6% Friday. </p><p></p>",
