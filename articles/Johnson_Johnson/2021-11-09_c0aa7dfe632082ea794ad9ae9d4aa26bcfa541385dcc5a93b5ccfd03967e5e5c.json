  "title": "Johnson & Johnson Opioid Verdict Overturned by Oklahoma Supreme Court; Justices say district court stepped into shoes of legislature",
  "text": "<p>The lawsuit featured thefirst trial in the nation that sought to hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable for widespread opioid addiction and overdoses. A state court judge found Johnson &amp; Johnson created misleading and dangerous marketing campaigns for drugs and opioids that lacked context and exaggerated opioids' safety and efficacy as pain treatments.</p><p>The drugmaker was ordered in 2019 to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to help address the damage caused. The dollar amount—initially $572 million but later reduced to $465 million—represented an estimated year's worth of treatment and programs.</p><p>\"The district court stepping into the shoes of the legislature by creating and funding government programs designed to address social and health issues goes too far,\" the majority opinion read. \"This Court defers the policy-making to the legislative and executive branches and rejects the unprecedented expansion of public nuisance law.\"</p><p>One justice dissented from the decision, two were disqualified and one was recused.</p><p>In his dissent, Justice James Edmondson argued the majority opinion's \"view of public nuisance is too narrow\" and the district court's previous ruling should stay in place, though the damages levied against Johnson &amp; Johnson could be recalculated.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson said the Oklahoma Court's decision reflected the facts of the case. \"Janssen's actions relating to the marketing and promotion of these important prescription pain medications were appropriate and responsible and did not cause a public nuisance,\" the company said.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson also said it recognized the opioid crisis is a complex public-health issue. \"We have deep sympathy for everyone affected,\" it said.</p><p>Oklahoma Attorney General John O'Connor said his staff was exploring options following the decision Tuesday.</p><p>\"I am disappointed,\" Mr. O'Connor said. \"We are still pursuing our other pending claims against opioid distributors who have flooded our communities with these highly addictive drugs for decades.\"</p><p>The case was one of thousands of lawsuits filed by states, local governments and Native American tribes claiming the pharmaceutical industry played a substantial role in inciting the opioid epidemic.</p><p>The ruling Tuesday comes after a California judge earlier this month cleared four drugmakers, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, of liability after a monthslong trial accusing the companies of causing widespread opioid addiction in the state. The lawsuit, filed in May 2014, alleged drugmakers manufactured painkillers too broadly and distributors didn't do enough to halt shipments that went beyond communities' medical needs.</p><p>In May, a trial in West Virginia began as lawyers for a county and city argued the nation's three largest drug distributors—McKesson Corp., AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Cardinal Health Inc.—should be held liable for the public-health crisis and help cover the expenses incurred by the opioid epidemic.</p><p>Opioids were involved in more than 70% of the nearly 841,000 drug overdose deaths since 1999, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Safety measures created in response to the Covid-19 pandemic complicated the process of seeking treatment for those dependent on opioids, as treatment specialists voiced concern about the need for in-person visits. Data collected by The Wall Street Journal in September 2020 showed counties reporting rising drug fatalities.</p><p>—Sara Randazzo contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jennifer Calfas at jennifer.calfas@wsj.com</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson Opioid Verdict Overturned by Oklahoma Supreme Court</p>",
