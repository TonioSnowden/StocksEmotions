  "text": "<p>Such considerations are likely to become pressing questions ahead of the quarterly close at the end of this month as these measures could face scrutiny from shareholders. The war also has exposed how many global companies -- both large and small -- have business ties to Russia.</p><p>\"This is something that each company needs to decide,\" said Amit Khandelwal, a professor for global business at Columbia Business School, referring to the question around Russian profits. \"A company has obligations to its employees -- both Russian and non-Russian -- shareholders and customers,\" he said.</p><p>A roster of international companies, including Bayer AG, Nestle SA, Danone SA, Kimberly-Clark Corp., Unilever PLC and PepsiCo Inc. say they keep selling in Russia to provide essential supplies, including cancer drugs, baby food and diapers. Among those products are potato chips, laundry detergent and air fresheners.</p><p>Nestle said it is limiting products sold in Russia to baby food, specialist veterinary meals and other nutrition products, adding it would donate any profit to humanitarian organizations. The company said it doesn't know how it will report the donations to investors.</p><p>Consumer-goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which continues to sell products in Russia, said it is donating money and products to aid Ukrainians.</p><p>Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. will continue to supply medication to Russia but will donate all profit to support Ukraine's relief efforts, Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said. \"Maintaining the supply of medicines to Russia does not mean we will continue doing business as usual in Russia,\" the company said.</p><p>Unilever, PepsiCo and Kimberly-Clark didn't respond to requests for comment, while Danone and Bayer pointed to existing statements that don't mention their profits from Russia. AstraZeneca PLC declined to comment on what it plans to do with profits from its medication sales in Russia.</p><p>Other companies may find it harder to give up revenue and profits generated in Russia, especially if they have large business interests in the country.</p><p>Metro AG, a German wholesaler that generated about 2.4 billion euros in sales -- equivalent to $2.64 billion -- or 10% of its total revenue from its Russian business during the latest fiscal year, said it will continue its operations there. The company declined to comment on whether it would consider donating the profits generated in Russia.</p><p>The depreciation of the ruble -- which has declined more than 20% against the dollar since Feb. 24 -- and other currencies has made the decision easier for some companies that say it isn't worth the effort or the reputational risk to keep booking profits from Russia.</p><p>---</p><p>Saabira Chaudhury and Sharon Terlep contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
