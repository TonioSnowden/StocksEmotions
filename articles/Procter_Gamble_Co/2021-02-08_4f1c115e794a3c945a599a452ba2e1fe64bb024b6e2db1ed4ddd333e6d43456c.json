  "text": "<p>But the ads on the whole give viewers scenes of a world without masks, social distancing or Zoom fatigue. Brands tried to make viewers laugh with goofy stunts, inspire them with promises of sustainability and stand out with celebrity cameos.</p><p>Here is almost every 2021 Super Bowl commercial, arranged loosely by theme, some in extended form.</p><p>Pandemic or political ads</p><p>Bud Light Seltzer Lemonade</p><p>\"Last Year's Lemons\" depicts everything that was bad about 2020 as a year-long hailstorm of lemons—useful as a segue to introduce the new lemonade flavor of Bud Light Seltzer.</p><p>Scotts Miracle-Gro</p><p>\"Ah, the backyard—it's had quite a year,\" a man says at the beginning of this commercial for Scotts Miracle-Gro Co., one of several Super Bowl advertisers that did well during the pandemic's lockdowns. \"I say let's keep this backyard thing going.\"</p><p>Jeep</p><p>Bruce Springsteen and Jeep implore Americans to form the \"ReUnited States of America.\"</p><p>Oblique references</p><p>Anheuser-Busch</p><p>Anheuser-Busch Cos. flagship and Super Bowl mainstay Budweiser didn't get its own ad in the game this year, saying it would put the money toward Covid-19 vaccine awareness. A-B's first corporate Super Bowl commercial doesn't bring up any of that, but it does present scenes of people sharing a beer in hard times.</p><p>M&amp;M's</p><p>Mars Inc. brand M&amp;M's might be winking at the divisions in the U.S. with these vignettes of reconciliation, including a woman's apology for calling someone \"Karen,\" in an ad titled \"Come Together.\"</p><p>Uber Eats</p><p>Uber Eats, the online food-delivery service owned by Uber Technologies Inc., bought its first Super Bowl ad following a surge in business during 2020. The ad makes no specific reference to that fact, but urges viewers to \"Eat Local,\" part of a broader program to help restaurants hurt during the pandemic.</p><p>Alternate realities</p><p>Robinhood</p><p>The first Super Bowl ad from Robinhood Markets Inc. ignores the reason the online brokerage was in the news around the world before the game: its leading part in the GameStop Corp. stock-trading frenzy.</p><p>Squarespace</p><p>Dolly Parton rewrites her classic song \"9 to 5\" for this ad from website platform Squarespace Inc. Almost as striking is the ad's start in a bland office full of people at their desks—something many office workers haven't seen in person since the pandemic began.</p><p>Nostalgia trips</p><p>Bud Light</p><p>Perennial Super Bowl advertiser Bud Light is back in the ad roster but instead of rolling out new comedic characters, the Anheuser-Busch brand brings a case full of past hits.</p><p>Cheetos</p><p>Frito-Lay, a unit of PepsiCo Inc., turns Shaggy's 2000 hit \"It Wasn't Me\" into a new story of domestic suspicion, starring married couple Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher, accompanied by a wry Shaggy.</p><p>Cadillac</p><p>Timothée Chalamet and Winona Ryder help General Motors Co.'s Cadillac continue the story of \"Edward Scissorhands\" in \"ScissorHandsFree,\" about a driver-assistance system.</p><p>Saving the world</p><p>Chipotle</p><p>The debut Super Bowl commercial from Chipotle plays up the chain's sustainability efforts.</p><p>General Motors</p><p>General Motors Co. goes to the Super Bowl to make sure nobody misses its commitment to electric vehicles. Actor and comedian Will Ferrell delivers the message, aided by Kenan Thompson and Awkwafina, with the nation of Norway as the foil.</p><p>Celebrities (and friends)</p><p>Doritos</p><p>Frito-Lay's ad for Doritos 3D Crunch stars a two-dimensional Matthew McConaughey—\"Flat Matthew\"—with cameos by Mindy Kaling and Jimmy Kimmel.</p><p>Michelob Ultra</p><p>Michelob Ultra brings (mostly) celebrity lookalikes to its Super Bowl ad, \"All-Star Cast.\"</p><p>Tide</p><p>Jason Alexander from \"Seinfeld\" provides the distressed faces on a hard-used sweatshirt in the latest Super Bowl ad from Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s Tide.</p><p>Hellmann's</p><p>Amy Schumer is a \"Fairy Godmayo\" in Hellmann's first Super Bowl commercial.</p><p>DoorDash</p><p>Business was good for DoorDash during the lockdowns of the pandemic, but the company didn't use the Super Bowl to talk about that; instead its ad stars actor and rapper Daveed Diggs and \"Sesame Street\" Muppets singing a cheery version of \"The People in Your Neighborhood.\"</p><p>Rocket Mortgage</p><p>Tracy Morgan, Dave Bautista and Liza Koshy help make the pitch for Rocket Mortgage in a pair of ads.</p><p>State Farm</p><p>State Farm adds celebrities including Drake and Paul Rudd to its ongoing campaign.</p><p>Celebrities (sports edition)</p><p>Frito-Lay</p><p>Previous Super Bowl stars including Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Deion Sanders, Joe Montana and Jerry Rice excitedly eat Frito-Lay snacks in an ad narrated by running back Marshawn Lynch.</p><p>Michelob Ultra</p><p>Michelob Ultra uses champions kicking back when they are not in competition to argue that winning can't be the only thing.</p><p>Skechers</p><p>Former quarterback Tony Romo and his wife Candice Crawford take things further for shoe marketer Skechers USA Inc.</p><p>Guaranteed Rate</p><p>Guaranteed Rate promotes home loans with the help of athletes including UFC fighters Dustin Poirier and Rose Namajunas, figure skater Starr Andrews and climber Erik Weihenmayer.</p><p>Offbeat</p><p>Fiverr</p><p>Freelance network Fiverr reveals what's underneath Four Seasons Total Landscaping, the business briefly thrust into the headlines in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>Mountain Dew</p><p>PepsiCo Inc.'s Mountain Dew rolls out a wacky, vibrantly-colored landscape, and a $1 million contest prize, for a new flavor.</p><p>Dr. Squatch</p><p>In an unusual Super Bowl appearance for a direct-to-consumer marketer, personal-care brand Dr. Squatch Inc. brings the jokey vibe of its YouTube videos to TV screens.</p><p>Jimmy John's</p><p>The so-called Chicken Sandwich Wars get all the attention in fast food; Inspire Brands Inc.'s Jimmy John's tries to shift the focus to a new \"sandwich war.\"</p><p>Technology, streaming and e-commerce</p><p>T-Mobile</p><p>Bad cellphone service leads to a surprising match in one T-Mobile spot; 5G helps Anthony Anderson keep in touch with family in another.</p><p>Verizon</p><p>A virtual Samuel L. Jackson rallies legions of avatars to get a better network.</p><p>Amazon Prime Video</p><p>Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall are reunited for Amazon Prime Video's sequel to \"Coming to America.\"</p><p>Amazon</p><p>Michael B. Jordan stars as Alexa's perfect vessel, at least for one Amazon.com Inc. employee.</p><p>DexCom</p><p>DexCom Inc. delivers one the most explicitly health-focused ads of the Super Bowl with this rant by musician Nick Jonas about finger sticks for people with diabetes, and promoting DexCom's alternative.</p><p>Klarna</p><p>Maya Rudolph stars as a quartet of quarter-sized cowboys to illustrate Klarna Bank AB's buy-now, pay-later service, which splits purchases into four smaller payments.</p><p>Logitech</p><p>Lil Nas X helps computer peripherals maker Logitech International SA pitch its products as tools for artists and activists.</p><p>Mercari</p><p>The Mercari Inc. online marketplace announces itself in straightforward fashion; an unwanted popcorn popper finds a new home.</p><p>Vroom</p><p>Online car seller Vroom Inc. channels horror movies to make traditional dealerships look scary.</p><p>Inspirational</p><p>E*Trade</p><p>E*Trade's \"Workout\" borrows from the training montages you see in movies to suggest that this might be the year customers get in shape (financially).</p><p>Huggies</p><p>The first diaper ad in the Super Bowl promises babies that the world will make sense eventually.</p><p>Toyota</p><p>Olympic sponsor Toyota Motor Corp. tells the story of 13-time Paralympic gold medalist Jessica Long.</p><p>Indeed</p><p>\"The Rising\" continues the long history of job-search sites in the Super Bowl, although Indeed Inc.'s debut big-game ad skips the humor of predecessors like Monster.com.</p><p>WeatherTech</p><p>WeatherTech Direct LLC, a Super Bowl regular that makes car floor-mats and other auto accessories, returns with two ads emphasizing its U.S. manufacturing.</p><p>Space</p><p>Pringles</p><p>Astronauts suffer when people get distracted combining Pringles flavors in \"Space Return,\" the latest entry from the Kellogg Co. brand.</p><p>Shift4 Payments</p><p>Shift4 Payments LLC, a payments technology platform, offers Super Bowl viewers a chance to join a planned trip to space. But it isn't the first or even second Super Bowl advertiser to promise such a thing: Super Bowl commercials for Axe body spray and auto maker Volvo made similar pitches in previous years. In both cases, the brands eventually wound up giving their contest winners money instead of the ride on a rocket.</p><p>Taxes</p><p>TurboTax</p><p>The Internal Revenue Service may have delayed Tax Day last year because of the pandemic, but taxes never really go away. So Intuit Inc.'s TurboTax returns to the game, promising expertise in the minutiae.</p><p>Write to Nat Ives at nat.ives@wsj.com</p>",
