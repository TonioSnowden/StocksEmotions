  "title": "Banking & Finance:  P&G Elects Board Despite Environmental Push  ----  By Sharon Terlep",
  "text": "<p>   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. shareholders on Tuesday elected the company's 12 director nominees to the board, including one member who environmentalists sought to unseat over the company's handling of climate issues. </p><p>   The Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and several dozen descendants of P&amp;G's founding families lobbied shareholders to vote against Angela Braly, who served as head of the board's governance and public responsibility committee. </p><p>   Ms. Braly, former chief executive of health insurer WellPoint Inc., has served on P&amp;G's board since 2009 and is a director at Exxon Mobil Corp., which has faced pressure to accelerate emissions reductions as its oil-and-gas rivals shift to renewable energy. </p><p>   Rarely do directors lose their seats in such votes, particularly when opponents aren't pushing an alternate candidate; still, the percentage of negative votes can signal shareholder discontent. </p><p>   P&amp;G said each nominee -- 11 of whom were incumbents -- received more than 90% support from shareholders, based on preliminary voting results from the annual investor meeting. Proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services recommended investors re-elect Ms. Braly. </p><p>   Unseating Ms. Braly was part of a broader campaign that environmentalists have been waging against P&amp;G to adopt more climate-friendly policies, including sourcing raw materials in ways they say are less harmful to the environment. Backing the efforts of environmental groups in the P&amp;G vote were several generations of family members descended from P&amp;G founders William Procter and James Gamble, who started the Cincinnati-based company more than 180 years ago. </p><p>   Advocates for environmental groups scored a win against P&amp;G last year when shareholders backed a proposal asking the maker of Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels to report on its efforts to address deforestation. Roughly two-thirds of P&amp;G shareholders, including large asset managers BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group and State Street Corp., voted in support of the measure. </p><p>   The environmental groups argued that P&amp;G -- which lobbied for shareholders to vote down the proposal last year -- is contributing to destruction of the Canadian boreal forest, from which the company sources material for some of its paper products. The woodlands cover 35% of Canada's land mass and aid the earth's environmental balance by producing oxygen and storing carbon. P&amp;G says its practices are sustainable and that it takes steps to ensure forests aren't destroyed in the sourcing of its products. It says it replaces twice as many trees as it cuts down. </p><p>   David Taylor, P&amp;G chairman and chief executive, said in a statement Tuesday that the vote signaled investor satisfaction with the company's sourcing practices. </p><p>   \"We've made a set of industry-leading commitments we are confident will help to protect, grow, and restore forests globally,\" he said. </p><p>   After Tuesday's vote, activists said they would continue to pressure P&amp;G. </p><p>   \"Until P&amp;G deals with its ties to forest destruction, the company will continue to face pressure from consumers and investors alike,\" said Shelley Vinyard, the Natural Resources Defense Council's boreal corporate campaign manager. \"We're not going away.\" </p><p></p>",
