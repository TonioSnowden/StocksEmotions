  "title": "Unilever CFO Struggles With Forecasting Accuracy Amid High Inflation; Further price increases are a 'distinct possibility,' following the company's record 12.5% hike during the third quarter, CFO says",
  "text": "<p>Materials inflation generally ranged from €100 million to €300 million during the years before 2021, Mr. Pitkethly said. \"Our forecasting accuracy has been a lot worse over the last year or so since this period of inflation hit,\" he said.</p><p>Other European companies are dealing with similar issues. BASF SE, the world's largest chemicals maker by sales, earlier this month said it is updating its forecasts and predictions more frequently. The company is developing at least one more scenario in addition to its usual best- and worst-case scenarios to reflect the high level of uncertainty around energy costs, CFO Hans-Ulrich Engel said.</p><p>Covestro AG, a specialty chemicals company based in Leverkusen, Germany, earlier this week said it is finding it \"extremely difficult\" to predict energy prices, alongside other costs, according to finance chief Thomas Toepfer.</p><p>Unilever increased the prices of its products by 12.5% during the past three-month period, marking the seventh consecutive quarter of increases. Further hiking prices in the fourth quarter is a \"distinct possibility,\" Mr. Pitkethly said, adding he doesn't expect the increases to deter consumer demand. That's because Unilever has pricing power due to its strong brands and relationships with consumers, he said.</p><p>\"I don't think I've ever experienced a time where the inflation pressures are so high,\" he said. \"I've never seen anything quite as extreme as this.\"</p><p>The company on Thursday reported a 10.6% rise in underlying sales growth, a metric that is adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, disposals and exchange-rate changes, for the quarter. Revenue rose 17.8% to €15.8 billion compared with the prior-year period.</p><p>Unilever earlier this year launched a host of initiatives to reduce costs and increase efficiency, including restructuring its business into five segments, which aims to generate €600 million in cost savings through July 2024.</p><p>The company last week finished shifting its enterprise resource planning system—which ties together various business processes in a common data or network structure—onto the cloud, a move that is aimed at making its planning around its supply chain and promotions more efficient, Mr. Pitkethly said.</p><p>Unilever's operating margins, which have suffered due to high inflation, are lower than those of competitors such as Procter &amp; Gamble Co., in part because it is spending more on employees and technology to boost long-term growth, said Jonathan Feeney, director of research at equity research firm Consumer Edge Research LLC.</p><p>\"They are willing to take that margin hit sooner than some others,\" Mr. Feeney said, referring to Unilever.</p><p>Unilever said it expects its operating margins to total 16% this year, down from 16.6% in 2021. Procter &amp; Gamble had operating margins of 22.2% for the year ended June 30, down from 23.6% the prior-year period, a filing shows.</p><p>Nina Trentmann contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Mark Maurer at Mark.Maurer@wsj.com</p><p>Unilever CFO Struggles With Forecasting Accuracy Amid High Inflation</p>",
