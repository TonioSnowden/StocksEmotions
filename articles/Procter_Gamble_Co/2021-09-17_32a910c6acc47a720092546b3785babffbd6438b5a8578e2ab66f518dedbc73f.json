  "text": "<p>\"Sometimes the ocean freight now is actually more expensive than the cost of the product,\" Chief Executive Officer Wade Miquelon said in a recent interview.</p><p>The company hasn't raised any base prices and is hoping the extra supply-chain expenses are temporary. \"I think they probably are, but does transient mean six months or 24 months?\" he said.</p><p>The pandemic has driven a long-lasting surge in transportation costs. Some CEOs expect elevated freight costs to stretch into 2023.</p><p>The cost of transporting goods is a component in every step in a company's supply chain.</p><p>Everything from iron ore, steel, parts and finished products has to move as raw materials are processed in global manufacturing.</p><p>The cost of shipping containers across the ocean is higher, truck drivers are in short supply, and gas is more expensive than many expected earlier this year.</p><p>\"We are not counting on material improvements in 2022, especially in the first portion of the year,\" Michael Witynski, CEO of the discount retailer Dollar Tree Inc., said last month.</p><p>Spot container shipping rates from Asia to the U.S. West Coast were five times higher last week compared with the same time last year, according to the Freightos Baltic Index.</p><p>Those rates are more than 14 times higher than during the same time in 2019.</p><p>\"It has just gone up so rapidly that it is now becoming part of the narrative here of this supply-chain-driven price shock that is proving to be a lot more intense and a lot more durable than we initially thought back in the spring,\" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.</p><p>Mondelez International Inc. said last week that global inflation was higher than expected, citing commodity and transportation costs. Molson Coors Beverage Co. said most of its cost inflation came from transportation increases. On Monday, 3M Co. said it is seeing \"a lot of pressure\" on logistics costs.</p><p>The French tire maker Michelin has spent tens of millions of dollars in extra costs to move natural rubber from the tropics to its production facilities to meet customer demand.</p><p>A dual shortage of truck drivers and shipping containers has raised the price of moving the company's products, which for months were even shipped by air. The company has only recently cut down on its use of more expensive airfreight, and said its supply-chain teams are constantly juggling shipping and transportation companies to keep things moving. \"That's why we had to raise prices for tires,\" Michelin Chief Executive Florent Menegaux said.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. has announced several price increases for products including Pampers diapers this year, but executives have cautioned that the speed and scope of freight and commodity-cost increases are too great to offset initially. The company is projecting $1.9 billion in added after-tax costs in its current fiscal year, which ends in June 2022.</p><p>\"The demand for trucks continues to increase at each step of the chain down to delivery to homes,\" Jon Moeller, the incoming CEO at the company, said at a June investor conference. \"Diesel fuel costs are up more than 25% versus April 2020.\"</p><p>Dollar Tree warned investors last month that freight-market conditions continued to deteriorate and that costs would be \"significantly higher than originally projected.\" The company expected its regular freight carriers would meet 85% of their contractual commitments, with the remainder sent at market rates. \"However, we now project that our regular carriers will fulfill only 60% to 65% of their commitments, and the spot-market rates will be much higher than previously estimated,\" Mr. Witynski said in late August.</p><p>Dollar Tree said the problems stem from equipment shortages, backlogs, port blockages, labor scarcity and Covid-19-related complications. A charter ship recently was denied entry to China because a crew member tested positive for coronavirus, forcing a two-month delay as the ship backtracked to replace its crew. In response, the company is using more domestic suppliers for goods, making seasonal purchases a month earlier than usual, being flexible with arrival and departure ports, and using dedicated space on chartered cargo ships, including one for a three-year term.</p><p>---</p><p>Emily Glazer and Sharon Terlep contributed to this article.</p>",
