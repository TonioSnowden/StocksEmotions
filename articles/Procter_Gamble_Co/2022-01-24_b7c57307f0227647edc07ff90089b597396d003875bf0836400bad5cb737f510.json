  "text": "<p>Unilever is planning&#xa0;to cut thousands of management jobs as it accelerates a push to improve sales growth across the business, which has come under increasing pressure from investors.</p> <p>The group's share price rose on Monday, pushing its market value to £100bn, after news that Nelson Peltz's activist hedge fund Trian Partners had built a stake in the FTSE 100 consumer goods group.</p> <p>The Financial Times&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a17a6811-78a8-4eb7-a2be-adbb8eb75119\">reported at the weekend</a>&#xa0;that the $8.5bn New York-based hedge fund, which has previously demanded reforms at Procter &amp; Gamble and Mondelez, had bought into Unilever. The size of the stake is not known. </p> <p>Unilever had already endured a tough week following news that it had made <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a1d6f47-90e0-4639-aed7-3817d4c18ed0\">three bids</a> for the consumer health division of GlaxoSmithKline, offering as much as £50bn — a move that proved unpopular with many investors. It retreated on Wednesday, saying it would not raise its bid.</p> <p>Investors reacted positively to Peltz's move, with shares in Unilever, best known for brands such as Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise, closing up 7.3 per cent on Monday to make the company the biggest gainer on the UK's blue-chip index.</p> <p>The group, which employs 149,000 people, is this week planning to announce a new operating model that is designed to accelerate growth. The plan will involve cutting thousands of management jobs, according to one person briefed on the situation. Unilever declined to comment.</p> <p>Martin Deboo, analyst at Jefferies, said: “We have long been of the view that the right path to unlock value at Unilever is via a faster rate of disposals from its slow-growing foods businesses, or a separation between foods and [the household and personal care division], via a sale or spin [off]. We think that Trian might take a similar view.”</p> <p>Trian's position raises the stakes for Unilever's chief executive, Alan Jope, who has faced an investor backlash against the GSK consumer health division bids. Fundsmith founder Terry Smith, a top-15 shareholder at Unilever, urged its management to focus on improving the existing business rather than targeting big acquisitions.</p> <p>Smith and his head of research Julian Robins <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/210a5297-159c-4d34-8096-933b1d04c4a1\">wrote to their investors</a> last week: “We believe the Unilever management — or someone else if they don't want the job — should surely focus on getting the operating performance of the existing business to the level it should be before taking on any more challenges.”</p> <p>New York-based Trian was founded in 2005 by Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May. It has a long history in the consumer goods sector, and notably has led activist campaigns at Mondelez International, Procter &amp; Gamble and Sysco.</p> <p>“The force and temperature of debate around Unilever now looks set to rise by several notches, with Trian likely to find a sympathetic audience in the form of apparently disgruntled UK long-only holders of Unilever,” said Deboo.</p><p>Source: Judith Evans and Harriet Agnew in London 2022 'Unilever plans to cut thousands of management jobs in growth drive ' FT.com 24 January.
