  "text": "<p>Sir Martin Sorrell has increased revenue forecasts for his digital marketing company S4 Capital for a third time this year, saying it was delivering growth more akin to that of Google and Facebook than traditional advertising groups.</p> <p>S4, which the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55d02167-dc39-463d-9f64-21fab8e68c0d\">76-year-old</a> launched three years ago following his acrimonious departure from WPP, said on Monday that it expected to deliver a year-on-year, like-for-like rise in full-year net revenue of 40 per cent, an increase from the start of the year of 25 per cent.</p> <p>Despite the latest increase to its sales guidance, shares in the London-listed company fell 8 per cent in early trading as some analysts were disappointed it was not accompanied by a more bullish outlook for profit margins. </p> <p>The stock reversed some of this loss by the afternoon to be down 3 per cent. Sorrell brushed aside the sell-off, noting the shares had almost doubled this year and rallied more than sixfold since S4 listed in 2018.</p> <p>S4 said it was “prioritising” revenues given the “early stage of the company's development”. Assignments from clients including Procter &amp; Gamble, Netflix and BMW helped first-half revenues rise from £141.3m a year ago to £279.3m.</p> <p>While the wider ad industry has been boosted in recent months as clients increase spending again to position brands for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d0cde78-fbdd-4091-be8b-4a5a0fea2466\">economic recovery</a>, Sorrell said S4's “digital-only” strategy had allowed it to outpace rivals. </p> <p>“There are two industries: a digital industry, which is growing, and a traditional, analogue industry, which is not,” he said.</p> <p>S4 said that unlike traditional ad companies its performance had not been flattered by comparisons with the onset of the pandemic, noting that its revenues were also up strongly from 2019 levels.</p> <p>The company said it was “more of a proxy on the growth of the digital platforms” such as Google and Facebook “rather than the ad holdcos [holding companies], which were generally flat” over the two years.</p> <p>“It is clear that the tragedy of Covid-19 has accelerated the speed of digital transformation,” said Sorrell, who is executive chair.</p> <p>He added that S4, which has rolled up several digital agencies including MightyHive and Firewood, was planning more deals, adding it had identified one company in particular in the technology services sector. S4's headcount has risen from 2,600 at the end of the first-half last year to almost 6,000.</p> <p>The company posted a pre-tax loss in the period of £19.4m, including acquisition-related costs and other “adjusting” items of £47.6m. The loss per share was 3.9p and no dividend was declared.</p> <p>Excluding adjusted items, however, operating profit rose from £16.3m to £31.3m.</p> <p>Analysts said they expected the investments S4 was making, including integrating its various businesses under the Media.Monks brand, to weigh on profitability. </p> <p>Omar Sheikh, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, said he expected consensus forecasts for earnings per share to dip about 2 per cent as a result of the update. But he added: “The story has not changed here — the operating performance of the business is incredibly strong.” </p> <p>The company's revenues remain a fraction of those at WPP, which Sorrell led for 33 years. But its market capitalisation is almost a third of that of his former company. </p> <p>WPP <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e864cac-d558-4d99-b5cf-852b818c58e7\">last month</a> announced first-half revenues of £6.1bn, a year-on-year increase of 16 per cent on a like-for-like basis.</p><p>Source: Alistair Gray 2021 'Sorrell's S4 Capital raises revenue forecasts for third time this year' FT.com 13 September.
