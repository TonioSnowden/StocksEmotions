  "text": "<p>Banks stocks remained in the spotlight, with Morgan Stanley and Bank of America reporting quarterly results.</p><p>How are stock indexes trading?</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index SPX was up 11 points, or 0.3%, to 4,589, led by declines in consumer discretionaryXX:SP500.25 and financialsXX:SP500.40.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 37 points, or 0.1%, to 35,408, with declines in Caterpillar Inc.

There's a lot of changes in investors' thinking that needs to happen, and those typically take time.”</p><p>While Peron said he's “constructive on the long-term” for stocks, he also expects the next three to six months to be choppy as the Fed looks to rein in easy monetary conditions unleashed during the pandemic.</p><p>Surging Treasury yields have weighed on the market's bullishness, particularly hitting yield-sensitive technology and other growth equities hard. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y on Wednesday was at around 1.84%, pulling back somewhat, but near levels not seen since early 2020.</p><p>Read: Stock-market warning signal: Here's what surging bond yields say about S&amp;P 500 returns</p><p>The yield on the 2-year Treasury note&#xa0;BX:TMUBMUSD02Y, more sensitive to Federal Reserve policy expectations, fell 3 basis points to 1.01%, after toughing the highest level since February 2020.</p><p>“There is concern that…the Fed is not easing into monetary policy normalization because it is so far behind the curve,” Invesco's chief global market strategist, Kristina Hooper, told MarketWatch.</p><p>But she also sees inflation, which the Fed now plans to fight, as weighing&#xa0;on the stock market. “In a number of the earnings calls, we are hearing about expenses going up…we're hearing about compensation going up,” Hooper said, noting that wage inflation tends to be longer-lived.</p><p>The Fed is scheduled to meet next Tuesday and Wednesday, though many think January will be too soon to pencil in the first interest-rate hike. But “there's a very good chance that policy makers will indicate a hike is on the way when the QE program draws to a close in two months time,” said Matthew Ryan, senior market analyst at Ebury, in a note.</p><p>In U.S. economic reports, home builders started construction on homes at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of roughly 1.7 million in December, representing a 1% increase from the previous month, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Wednesday.
