  "title": "Stocks Fall Despite Solid Earnings --- After two days of gains, concerns about impact of higher rates on economy dominate",
  "text": "<p>The losses came despite quarterly reports from big companies that were mostly better than expected. Soaring inflation has dimmed the investing outlook all year, but encouraging results from large U.S. banks had boosted stocks in recent sessions. A stream of mostly upbeat reports from diverse companies Wednesday reinforced a sense that the business climate has held up well so far.</p><p>Still, anxiety about inflation and the Federal Reserve's response continued to preoccupy investors. The persistence of rising prices has consistently exceeded investors' expectations over the past year.</p><p>\"I think the broader issue in this earnings season is really not just how companies are doing, but the macro issues with interest rates and Fed policy,\" said Jimmy Chang, chief investment officer at Rockefeller Global Family Office.</p><p>Losses hit 10 of the S&amp;P's 11 sectors, with only energy stocks notching gains.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble shares climbed $1.19, or 0.9%, to $129.56 after the consumer-goods company lowered its outlook for full-year sales and its quarterly earnings came in above Wall Street's estimates. Netflix jumped $31.52, or 13%, to $272.38 after it said it gained 2.4 million new subscribers last quarter. Ally Financial fell $2.28, or 7.9%, to $26.43 after it reported a drop in earnings and said it set aside more funds in reserve against potential loan losses.</p><p>United Airlines' forecast for rising profit margins and resilient sales lifted airline shares but also indicated that travel demand may continue to support high ticket prices, said Brandon Pizzurro, director of public investments at GuideStone Capital Management.</p><p>Trends like that build the case for more rate increases. When they finally bite, corporate performance could quickly slump across industries, he warned. \"I'm concerned that we're getting the very last amount of any good news out of a large majority of these companies,\" Mr. Pizzurro said.</p><p>United shares rose $1.85, or 5%, to $39.10.</p><p>Signs that shoppers aren't ready to stop spending on dining, vacations and entertainment reinforce the case for more Fed interest-rate increases, which many investors think could cause a recession in the next year.</p><p>Inflation may reduce the central bank's perceived leeway to shift gears and ease policy again to cushion the economy when it does slow.</p><p>Yields on U.S. government debt, which largely reflect investors' expectations for how short-term interest rates will move through the maturity date, climbed on Wednesday. The 10-year yield rose to 4.127% from 3.996% the day before. The two-year yield, more sensitive to short-term rate expectations, was at 4.55%, up from 4.435% on Tuesday. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Oil prices edged up, with global crude benchmark Brent climbing by $2.38 a barrel, or 2.6%, to $92.41.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 slid 0.5%. Early Thursday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 1.1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 2.3% and South Korea's Kospi was down 1.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.5%.</p>",
