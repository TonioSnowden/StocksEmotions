  "text": "<p><em>Sorry there was no City Bulletin yesterday, I had a nasty case of noro. Normal service now resumes.</em></p> <p><strong>EasyJet</strong> makes only a single reference to Omicron in its full-year results this morning, where it unveiled a £1bn statutory loss in a heavily pandemic-affected year. The airline said it was too soon to say what the impact of the new Covid-19 variant would be, but added that it had “prepared itself for periods of uncertainty such as this”. </p> <p>While there had been a pick-up in transfer requests and “some softening of trading” for the three months to the end of December, easyJet said it was still seeing good levels of new bookings for next summer and expected “a return to near pre-pandemic levels of capacity” by then. It plans to fly 70 per cent of 2019 capacity between January and March, but has trimmed its estimate for the current quarter to 65 per cent. </p> <p>Will Omicron be just another blip before the great getaway of summer 2022? Or are airlines kidding themselves? Tell me what you think at&#xa0;<a href=\"mailto:citybulletin@ft.com\">citybulletin@ft.com</a>.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Half-year profits at fintech <strong>Wise</strong> fell slightly despite revenues rising by one-third on the same period a year ago. Pre-tax profits for the six months to September were £18.8m compared to £20m a year earlier, while revenues were £256m. Admin costs linked to Wise's stock market listing earlier this year, increasing headcount and IT and marketing investments ate into margins.</p> <p>Activist <strong>Bluebell</strong>, a small outfit that has made a big noise at Danone and GSK, is now targeting <strong>Glencore</strong>. Bluebell wants the commodities group to spin off its thermal coal business, divest non-core assets and improve corporate governance, our natural resources editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f5a8c43-76d4-4843-a15e-47bc767ec6d8\">Neil Hume reports</a>. </p> <p>West End landlord <strong>Shaftesbury</strong> is full of cheer post “Freedom Day” (July 19, in case that seems like a distant memory). How long it lasts remains to be seen. But Shaftesbury reported a “remarkable bounce back in activity”, with weekend footfall back to 2019 levels and weekdays at 80 per cent. Its financial year, which ended in September, was severely affected by the pandemic, with net property income down almost 13 per cent, and an after-tax loss of £195m (though the previous year's loss was £700m). But it reported a recovery in valuations in the second half of the year “as pandemic uncertainties began to recede”. </p> <p>Sandwich maker <strong>Greencore</strong> reported a return to revenue growth in the year to September. The food-to-go supplier had been heavily hit by changes in working patterns, but reported a 5 per cent rise in revenues for the year and turned out a £28m profit on revenues of £1.3bn. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Moderna's</strong> chief executive has predicted existing vaccines will be much less effective at tackling Omicron than earlier strains of Covid-19. In an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f\">interview with the FT</a>, Stéphane Bancel also warned it would take months before pharma companies could manufacture new variant-specific jabs at scale. The interview is well worth a read — and once you've done that, do check out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cea5e3f-d4c4-4ee2-961a-3aa150f388ec\">this fascinating Big Read</a> from our pharma team on the inside story of the Pfizer vaccine: “a once-in-an-epoch windfall”.</p> <p><strong>Inditex</strong>, the owner of Zara, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b042f34-9f29-4b15-9316-01c555bdee2f\">shaking up its board</a>, naming a new chair and chief executive. Marta Ortega Pérez, daughter of the fashion retailer's founder Amancio Ortega, will become chair. She replaces Pablo Isla, the executive who led the group as CEO between 2005 and 2019 and as chair since 2011. Carlos Crespo, who took over as CEO in 2019, will become chief operating officer, while general counsel Óscar García Maceiras takes over as chief executive. </p> <p><strong>Theranos</strong> founder <strong>Elizabeth Holmes</strong> accused her former business partner of abuse in her criminal fraud trial. She testified that Ramesh Balwani berated her and forced her to have sex, Miles Kruppa reports from San Jose. More on the latest developments in the trial <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c3977f0-7909-4da7-b5a6-295e06a81679\">here</a>. </p> <p>The US competition watchdog has demanded retailers and consumer goods groups including <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Walmart</strong> and <strong>Procter &amp; Gamble</strong> hand over information about their supply chains, as the Federal Trade Commission probes the causes of shortages and high prices. Our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a50f9bd-cb8d-4362-84bc-857e6bc3523b\">US team report</a> how the move will put pressure on corporate America to defend its prices and business practices — and take additional steps to ease backlogs ahead of the festive shopping season. </p> <p>Finally, yesterday Jack Dorsey resigned as chief executive of <strong>Twitter</strong>, the social media company he co-founded. Twitter has named Parag Agrawal, the company's chief technology officer, as Dorsey's successor. If you want a refresher on Dorsey's time in charge, our team have you covered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf45fd08-51d1-41bb-82cd-b3157a5da055\">here</a>.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>BT</strong> shareholder? <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfc0eac5-0db1-42b1-9385-54bbf81d826a\">Helen Thomas has bad news for you</a>. After speculation that Indian billionaire <strong>Mukesh Ambani's Reliance</strong> was considering a bid, shares in the telecoms group jumped — even after Reliance knocked down the story. Bid hopes look detached from reality, Thomas argues, with BT's pension scheme and the political climate both significant barriers to any deal. “BT investors, like its engineers, are likely to have to do the hard yards.”</p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'Boosterish easyJet points to ‘softening' from Omicron' FT.com 30 November.
