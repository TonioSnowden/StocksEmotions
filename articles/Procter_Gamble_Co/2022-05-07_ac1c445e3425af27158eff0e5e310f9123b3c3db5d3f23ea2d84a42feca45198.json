  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Personal Board of Directors: Brian Niccol --- CEO of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.",
  "text": "<p>As that chain's marketing chief and president, Mr. Niccol introduced the \"Live Mas\" slogan and helped launch the hit snack-food mashup Doritos Locos Tacos.</p><p>In 2018, Mr. Niccol, now 48, became one of Chipotle's first outside chief executives, succeeding founder Steve Ells. He beefed up food-safety procedures and was early to offer delivery through companies like DoorDash Inc. He dreamed of building online ordering tools at Chipotle that could rival those at Starbucks Corp. and Domino's Pizza Inc.</p><p>That came in handy when the pandemic hit, closing many of Chipotle's dining rooms. Online sales accounted for nearly half of orders last year.</p><p>Chipotle's sales hit a record in 2021, and the company's shares are trading at almost five times the price when Mr. Niccol started the job. He hopes to reach a total of 7,000 stores in North America, up from 3,000 today.</p><p>\"Have we had a perfect path to getting here? No,\" Mr. Niccol said. \"Are we committed to doing the right things? Absolutely.\"</p><p>Here are four of his trusted advisers.</p><p>Craig Cappozzo</p><p>CEO, Thriving Brands Co.</p><p>Mr. Niccol got a summer internship working at Procter &amp; Gamble Co. under Mr. Cappozzo in 1995, then landed his first job working on brands including Scope mouthwash with the executive the following year. Mr. Cappozzo helped Mr. Niccol learn the P&amp;G principle of distilling an idea down to key points that can fit on a one-page memo, not just stringing along ideas in a PowerPoint presentation, he said. \"It takes some practice, it takes some discipline, it takes some focus, and that's really helped me over time,\" Mr. Niccol said. \"He helped me transition from being a college kid to an executive.\"</p><p>Scott Bergren</p><p>Former Yum Brands Inc. executive</p><p>Mr. Bergren, then the president and CEO of Pizza Hut, promoted Mr. Niccol to become the chain's marketing chief in 2007. Mr. Bergren helped him think creatively in ways Mr. Niccol said he hadn't previously explored. The two men pushed Pizza Hut into online ordering and helped develop one of the first pizza-chain ordering apps for iPhone, an achievement that still excites Mr. Niccol. He often calls his old mentor to talk, and often leaves the conversation surprised by new insights that hadn't occurred to him, Mr. Niccol said.</p><p>Jamie Egasti</p><p>Former Procter &amp; Gamble Co. executive</p><p>Mr. Egasti, the general manager of snacks at P&amp;G who oversaw the Pringles account in 2000, was Mr. Niccol's boss at the time. Mr. Egasti was dreaming up exclusive chip flavors for retailers to try to increase sales. Mr. Egasti taught Mr. Niccol to focus on one specific product and what customers wanted from it, and to block out other distractions. His advice: \"You can't skip what your customers are telling you they need.\"</p><p>David Novak</p><p>Former Yum Brands Inc. CEO and chairman</p><p>Mr. Niccol rose through the Yum ranks during Mr. Novak's tenure, and became head of Taco Bell in 2015. Mr. Novak freely offered both praise and criticism, Mr. Niccol recalled. The two would work on specific points of personal improvement for the year. \"He was always a huge champion of making me better,\" Mr. Niccol said. Mr. Novak also introduced Mr. Niccol to others who remain influential advisers in his life, including Home Depot Inc. co-founder Ken Langone and CVS Health Corp. Chairman David Dorman, he said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
