  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Global Flow Of Goods Gets Back To Normal",
  "text": "<p>\"It's obvious that freight rates peaked and began to normalize, driven by falling demand and an easing supply-chain congestion,\" said Soren Skou, chief executive of Maersk. In November, the shipping company lowered its 2023 forecast for container demand -- a proxy for global trade. It now expects a decline from 2% to 4%, from a maximum decline of 1% previously.</p><p>In the U.S., retailers have ample inventory. Railroads averted a labor strike and package-delivery trucks have plenty of spare capacity. That bodes well for U.S. consumers heading into 2023, executives and analysts say, although profits for transport companies will be pinched now that demand and supply are back in balance.</p><p>\"Just to remind us of where we were, a year ago, in the holiday season, Americans were wondering if we would get basic goods, not to mention Christmas presents, when we needed them,\" said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a speech at UPS Worldport in Louisville, Ky., in early December.</p><p>FedEx Corp. and other regional carriers are having an easier time delivering packages this peak season, with additional capacity and steady parcel volume. On Tuesday, FedEx reported average daily parcel volumes fell 10.2%, declining for the fourth straight quarter.</p><p>There were generally enough package sorters, drivers and sorting machines, helping FedEx hit a higher on-time performance rate, 95.3%, in the last week of November, up from 83.9% in the same time a year ago, according to data from ShipMatrix Inc., a parcel analytics firm.</p><p>The U.S. Postal Service, which makes last-mile deliveries for several package delivery companies, said its previous investments in new sorting machines have helped expand its package processing capacity to 60 million a day. This has helped it better handle the holiday mailing and shipping rush.</p><p>Even before the holiday season, parcel carriers noted consumers had pulled back on buying goods online. People resumed spending on travel, parties and entertainment as the pandemic waned. Ample retail inventories have also compelled some companies to pull back on orders or restocking.</p><p>For some of the biggest U.S. manufacturers and retailers, supply-chain costs have become a budgetary bright spot rather than a liability. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. expects to spend $100 million less than it had anticipated on transportation and warehousing in the fiscal year ending in June 2023, the company said in October.</p><p>Dollar General Corp., after years of citing high transportation costs as a drag on the business, said in December that falling transit prices could begin lifting the company in 2023.</p><p>Not all supply chains are running smoothly. Apple Inc. has warned that shipments of its high-end iPhone models would be hindered amid Covid restrictions at one of its major suppliers in China. Ford Motor Co. has raised the price of its electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck three times this year, partly because of supply-chain constraints and higher material costs. New waves of the pandemic or geopolitical tensions could create new problems.</p><p>Another potential snarl was averted recently when the White House interceded to end long-running contract talks between U.S. freight railroads and union groups. The decision imposed a five-year contract on both sides, preventing a potential December strike.</p><p>The major railroads, Union Pacific Corp., CSX Corp., BNSF Railway and Norfolk Southern Corp., said they have managed to hire more train and engine crew members in the second half of the year, following months of difficulties in recruitment.</p><p>Goods are moving through the biggest U.S. port complex faster than at any time since cargo backed up at the swamped Los Angeles-Long Beach docks early in the pandemic. The average container's dwell time is just 2.8 days, according to the Pacific Merchant Shipping Association. Meanwhile, U.S. container imports reached their lowest level in November since the early months of 2020, according to research group Descartes Datamyne.</p><p>The slowdown is already evident in ocean-shipping rates. The daily spot rate to move a shipping container from Asia to the U.S. West coast is hovering around $1,400, down from about $7,500 in July and roughly $15,000 a year ago, according to the Freightos Baltic Index. The average cost in 2019, before Covid, was around $1,500.</p>",
