  "text": "<h2>Unilever: Peltz trader</h2> <p>Could Unilever be in the sights of billionaire activist investor Nelson Peltz? One of the City's highest-rated scribblers thinks it might. </p> <p>A dreary share price performance under chief executive Alan Jope has made Unilever a potential target for Peltz's Trian Fund Management, according to research published this week by US investment house Bernstein. Peltz is retiring from the board of Procter &amp; Gamble after nearly four years so will be looking for a new campaign, analyst Bruno Monteyne told clients. </p> <p>Trian used a $3.5bn stake in P&amp;G to successfully lobby for Peltz's appointment to the board, where he pushed for reorganisation designed to cut through what he called the company's “suffocating bureaucracy”. Applying a similar playbook to Unilever might involve pushing the maker of Bovril, Marmite and Cup a Soup out of its low-growth categories, perhaps through the sale or demerger of its entire foods and refreshment division. </p> <p>Monteyne, a former Tesco logistics director, recently switched briefs to consumer staples from grocers having been consistently rated <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b5f4b4d-cbf8-4269-af2c-c94063197bbb\">top analyst</a> in the sector. His is a new spin on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6078f45-a291-4657-9cf4-e905f2a3450d\">persistent speculation</a> that Unilever could become a pure-play home and personal care business, which has surfaced regularly even though the pace of restructuring under successive managements has been glacial. </p> <p>First-round bids in the auction for Unilever tea brands including PG Tips and Lipton are expected next month, almost two years after Jope announced a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3be09fce-432d-11ea-abea-0c7a29cd66fe\">strategic review</a> of the division.</p> <h2>Robey Warshaw: lean machine</h2> <p>Boutique advisers such as Robey Warshaw have been having a tough time during the private equity-powered merger and acquisition boom in the London market. </p> <p>Robey sits at number 29 in the league table for M&amp;A advisory in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, according to Dealogic data. With just two deals in the year to date at a total value of $25.3bn, its Emea market share has drifted to just 2.2 per cent as rivals such as Rothschild and the bulge bracket banks racked up transactions in triple figures. </p> <p>Since its inception in 2013, London-based Robey has attached its name to some of the City's biggest deals, including Comcast's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a02224a2-be96-11e8-8d55-54197280d3f7\">takeover of Sky</a>, Reckitt Benckiser's purchase of baby-formula maker <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d79c4fd0-ef66-11e6-ba01-119a44939bb6\">Mead Johnson Nutrition</a> and Vodafone's asset swap with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73ef336a-a93d-11e9-984c-fac8325aaa04\">John Malone's Liberty Global</a>. The peak came in 2018, when four deals worth a combined $88.9bn gave Robey an Emea market share of 6.1 per cent and a Dealogic ranking of 15. </p> <h2>Oliver Cookson: whey to go</h2> <p>Slated for publication next week is <em>Bootstrap Your Life</em>, “an <a href=\"https://olivercookson.com/\">inspiring, rags-to-riches guide</a> to achieving success in life and business by the founder of Myprotein”. The book will probably gain a few interested readers at The Hut Group, Matthew Moulding's cosmetics-and-whey-powder empire. </p> <p>THG bought Myprotein in 2011 from founder Oliver Cookson, who briefly became chair of the company's lifestyle division. Auditors then uncovered an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ad84653-e32d-4249-bfb4-b33c88ce4569\">overstatement</a> of THG's profits that involved non-existent stock, unrecorded liabilities and disappearing receivables. Moulding shelved plans for a flotation and the pair sued each other. </p> <p>Details of the fraud surfaced in a 2014 High Court hearing where THG was ordered to pay Cookson £10.8m over a breach of contract. The Monaco-based entrepreneur sued THG again in 2019, alleging that his stake had been unlawfully diluted after shares held in trust were stripped of co-sale rights, which give a private company's minority investors the option of selling on the same terms as any disposal by the majority holder.</p> <p>Yet there seems to be no bad blood between the parties. Cookson's book makes no mention of the fraud or court cases and is generally complimentary of Moulding's management team. Meanwhile, Companies House filings show Cookson rejoined THG as a non-executive director for six months of 2020. He resigned a few weeks before THG completed the prospectus for its flotation that September. </p> <p>Instead of a history lesson, THG investors would rather be talking about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ad84653-e32d-4249-bfb4-b33c88ce4569\">the landmark investment</a> agreed in May with SoftBank. One obstacle they face is SoftBank. The 112-page investor briefing that accompanied the Japanese group's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b98db7c-24e9-4aa4-bc42-56338139962e\">quarterly results</a> this week made no reference to THG. Nor did chief executive Masayoshi Son's 90-minute results webcast.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Unilever tipped as prime target for activist Peltz ' FT.com 13 August.
