  "text": "<p>His comments come after government data released last week showed consumer prices jumped at a 7.9% annual rate last month, the highest in four decades.</p><p>And a poll by The Wall Street Journal showed nonwhite voters were more likely to say the recent inflation is causing a big financial strain on their lives.</p><p>\"As a general principle, for those looking for advice from this thread, it is generally better to own physical things like a home or stock in companies you think make good products, than dollars when inflation is high,\" Mr. Musk said on Twitter.</p><p>\"I still own &amp; won't sell my Bitcoin, Ethereum or Doge fwiw,\" he added.</p><p>The price of bitcoin was recently trading at around $39,000, according to CoinDesk. It is down by roughly half from its all-time high in November.</p><p>Mr. Musk's net worth is $206 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.</p><p>In one of his tweets, Mr. Musk asked his 77.7 million followers what their thoughts were about the probable inflation rate over the next few years.</p><p>Inflation expectations are important because how people perceive future price moves can play a role in actual inflation and determining how and when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates.</p><p>A report released Monday showed households in February expect 6% inflation a year from now, a new record and up from 5.8% in January, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p><p>\"The increase was widespread across age, education, and income groups, but largest for the respondents without a high-school diploma,\" the bank said.</p><p>Inflation is being felt from consumers to businesses. More than 350 companies in the S&amp;P 500 cited inflation during their earnings calls for the latest quarter, according to financial-data provider FactSet, the most since at least 2010.</p><p>Mr. Musk's comments echoed Tesla's recent results as well. The company said higher logistics costs and materials prices weighed on profit last year.</p><p>Other companies have been feeling similar pressures, from soda maker Coca-Cola Co. to consumer products company Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</p><p>\"Inflationary and supply chain pressures continue to impact costs across several fronts in the business, including input costs, transportation, marketing and operating expenses,\" Coca-Cola Chief Financial Officer John Murphy told analysts on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call last month.</p><p>P&amp;G, the maker of Pampers diapers and Tide laundry detergent, said it expected inflationary pressure to continue.</p><p>\"Availability of materials remain stretched in some categories and in some markets, inflationary pressures are broad-based with little sign of near term relief,\" Andre Schulten, chief financial officer at P&amp;G, said on the company's second-quarter earnings call in January.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
