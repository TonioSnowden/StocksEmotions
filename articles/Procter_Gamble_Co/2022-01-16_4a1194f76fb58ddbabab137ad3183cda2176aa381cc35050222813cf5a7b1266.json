  "text": "<p>Hello and welcome to the working week.</p> <p>Political change is in the air. First, what we know will happen. There will be new leadership for the European Parliament with a vote for the president in a secret ballot on Monday. </p> <p>It follows the death of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cb62a51-b244-44f0-85d7-9c158779d1be\">David Sassoli</a> last week, although the Italian Democrat was due to step down this week under a power-sharing deal with the centre-right European People's party. He is likely to be succeeded by&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4c205df-9cd7-43a2-b9dc-4943f5d1a84a\">Roberta Metsola</a>, a Maltese MEP selected by the EPP as its candidate for president.</p> <p>We do not know for definite <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66dacee8-3140-4886-96e8-d856e5edefaa\">whether Emmanuel Macron will run</a> in France's presidential elections later this year. But we do know he will be addressing the European Parliament on Wednesday to give a speech to mark France's assumption of the revolving EU presidency. He will no doubt be aware of the political capital to be gained from this appearance.</p> <p>Then there is the great unknown swirling around the British government's “partygate” scandals. This could be the week that Sue Gray completes her official report, detailing what happened at certain events. It feels like the drinking puns have all but been exhausted — run dry has surely been used by someone by now — but they seem so apt for a prime minister facing an ignominious ejection from his job. Having said that, it is a brave soul that bets against Boris Johnson's remarkable survival instinct, as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1dbcbdd-461b-4fdf-a448-b04dd280fbdc\">this comprehensive analysis</a> by the FT's political team laid bare last week.</p> <p>Then there are the outside forces threatening to overwhelm a government. Watch out for further news from the frontline between Russia and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/8b9c78a1-2a6d-4e2f-9293-49f399f4f6ce\">Ukraine</a>, where tensions will not be relieved by the latter commemorating its Day of Unity on Saturday, the day after the former commemorates the anniversary of Lenin's death.</p> <h1>Economic data</h1> <p>Whether or not you think the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/global-inflation\">spikes in inflation around the world</a> are temporary or entrenched, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/088d3368-bb8b-4ff3-9df7-a7680d4d81b2\">story about rising living costs</a> has a long way to run. </p> <p>This week's instalment will be sustained by consumer and producer price index data from Germany, the UK, Japan, Canada and Italy plus the publication of the minutes of the European Central Bank Governing Council's December meeting.</p> <p>The Bank of Japan holds its monthly meeting and is expected to upgrade its growth and inflation forecasts, but leave policy rates and other measures unchanged. The Fed goes into “purdah” ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on January 26. </p> <p>China will set its monthly loan prime rates while Turkey is expected to keep rates unchanged — no doubt a relief to those hit by the collapse of the lira after 500 basis points of rate cuts in quick succession.</p> <h1>Companies</h1> <p>Earnings season will be in full swing and the US markets are expecting a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e368846-b4f8-467f-a7d9-52a39b54f62d\">bumper crop of results</a>. The pandemic has been boom time for streaming services — with the trickle down being felt by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ce18e41-0593-4438-a62c-cb8c2456eb92\">more traditional industries</a>. </p> <p><strong>Netflix</strong> arguably had its strongest-ever slate of original content in the fourth quarter, with the <em>Squid Game</em> craze continuing its run and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ab36824-b456-4eb0-a1fd-10752a73d357\">much anticipated release</a>&#xa0;of&#xa0;<em>Don't Look Up</em>.</p> <p>But some analysts say the streaming pioneer may still have trouble reaching the consensus expectation of 8.7m new subscribers when it reports results on Thursday — mainly due to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10d41405-4e0c-4a58-95c0-f02586081b6a\">rising competition</a> from its peers, which have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae756fda-4c27-4732-89af-cb6903f2ab40\">spending significant sums</a> on new television programmes and films. MoffettNathanson, the investment research firm, last week lowered its estimate of new subscribers at Netflix in the fourth quarter to 8.6m from 9.6m.</p> <p>Delivery app firms have also prospered during the pandemic — and most recently during the desire to stay in to avoid Omicron, as #techft lead writer Chris Nuttall noted in his<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d791eb66-acaa-4796-b057-285fba16e408\"> latest newsletter</a>.
