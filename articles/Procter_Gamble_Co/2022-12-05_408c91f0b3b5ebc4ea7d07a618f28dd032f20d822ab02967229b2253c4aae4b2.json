  "text": "<p>Mr. Dorer served as CEO of Clorox from 2014 until 2020 after a decade at the household staple product maker and 15 years at consumer-goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</p><p>VF said Mr. Rendle's departure was by mutual agreement with the board. The company said Richard Carucci, a board member since 2009, will serve as interim chairman.</p><p>The shakeup at the top of VF comes as the company lowered its fiscal 2023 sales and earnings guidance, citing weaker-than-expected consumer demand across its categories, primarily in North America.</p><p>VF said the weak demand has resulted in an elevated promotional environment and order cancellations in the wholesale channel to manage trade inventories.</p><p>The company said it now expects full-year adjusted per-share earnings of $2 to $2.20, down from a prior forecast of $2.40 to $2.50, and full-year constant-dollar sales growth of 3% to 4%, compared with prior guidance for a rise of 5% to 6%.</p><p>Analysts polled by FactSet, on average, were expecting VF to post fiscal 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.41 a share.</p><p>VF shares fell 11% to $29.51 on Monday. They are down 60% this year.</p><p>Write to Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com</p><p>VF Corp. Chairman and CEO Steven Rendle Retires</p>",
