  "title": "Procter & Gamble Posts Its Biggest Sales Gain in Decades; Company says shoppers continue to pay for premium items such as fragrance-free diapers and high-end razors, despite rising prices",
  "text": "<p>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. posted its biggest quarterly sales gain in at least two decades as consumers, undeterred by inflation and the threat of a recession, paid more for household mainstays including Pampers diapers and Gillette razors.</p><p>The Cincinnati consumer-products company said organic sales rose 10% for the quarter ended March 31, the biggest jump since P&amp;G started tracking the metric 20 years ago. Organic sales is a closely watched figure that strips out deals and currency moves.</p><p>P&amp;G's priciest offerings were in highest demand, the company said, continuing a trend that has persisted throughout the pandemic. Rather than switching to discount alternatives, consumers on average switched to even-pricier products, from fragrance-free diapers to high-end razors, P&amp;G finance chief Andre Schulten said in an interview.</p><p>\"So far, the consumer is holding up and they clearly see the value in the superiority of our brands,\" he said.</p><p>The strongest growth was in P&amp;G's healthcare segment, which houses brands such as Crest toothpaste and Vicks cold medicine. Organic sales in that unit rose 16% as the company raised prices, consumers switched to premium products and a more severe cough, cold and flu season drove up demand for over-the-counter medications. The two divisions that make home-care and laundry products and baby and feminine-care products each notched 10% gains.</p><p>Pricing overall rose 5%, while sales volumes increased 3%. The only drag was foreign exchange, which lowered revenue by 3%.</p><p>Profit increased as well, albeit more modestly than sales, as P&amp;G absorbed higher costs for materials and transportation and spent more on new products and packaging. P&amp;G reported earnings per share of $1.33, up 6% from the same period a year earlier, while revenue climbed 7% to $19.4 billion.</p><p>Analysts polled by FactSet predicted earnings per share of $1.29 and sales of $18.7 billion. P&amp;G reported net income of $3.4 billion; analysts predicted $3.3 billion for the quarter.</p><p>U.S. inflation hit a four-decade high of 8.5% in March compared with the same month a year earlier, driven by skyrocketing energy and food costs, supply constraints and strong consumer demand. Many of the world's companies are bracing for belt-tightening by consumers, and analysts and industry executives are seeing early signs of a spending slowdown.</p><p>But spending on household staples remains strong. The biggest U.S. supermarket operators are reporting rising sales and profits as they raise prices of many products rather than absorb all increases.</p><p>Should a recession hit and consumers begin to balk at higher prices, P&amp;G would face its first test of operating in an economic downturn since the company's sales growth dropped to anemic levels in 2009 amid the financial crisis and didn't recover for a decade.</p><p>Mr. Schulten said the company is better prepared.</p><p>It unloaded businesses, such as its beauty unit, that tend to dip in tough financial times. The company has invested in lower-price alternatives to its costliest brands, expanded into dollar and club stores that draw deal seekers and has begun to focus marketing on the savings potential in more-expensive products.</p><p>For instance, P&amp;G for years has offered laundry detergent that can be effective in cold-wash cycles. Recently it has begun to promote the product more heavily, making the case that savings from using cold water outweigh the added expense of the detergent.</p><p>\"We're watching carefully and we believe we're better positioned than we ever were,\" for a slowdown in consumer spending, Mr. Schulten said.</p><p>P&amp;G on Wednesday raised its organic-sales growth forecast to a range of 6% to 7%, up from its earlier forecast of 4%-to-5% growth for the fiscal year ending June 30. It predicted core earnings per share will rise about 3%, the low end of its forecast of 3%-to-6% growth.</p><p>Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble Posts Its Biggest Sales Gain in Decades</p>",
