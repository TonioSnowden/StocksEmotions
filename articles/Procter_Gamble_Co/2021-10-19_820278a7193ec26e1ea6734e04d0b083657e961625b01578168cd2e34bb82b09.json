  "text": "<p>The U.S. stock market has been on a bumpy ride for the last month and a half, dogged by concerns about inflation and slowing growth. Investors have been digesting the possibility that inflationary pressures could last longer than expected as supply-chain bottlenecks and labor shortages continue to flare. Signs of slowing economic growth in the U.S. and abroad have added to concerns.</p><p>A strong start to third-quarter earnings season, however, has alleviated some of the uneasiness among investors. About 81% of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported so far have beat earnings-per-share expectations, according to FactSet data through Monday morning.</p><p>\"Many of the companies we are looking at are citing very strong demand, and we can work with a situation where demand is strong and supply is problematic because eventually we will work through supply problems,\" said Christopher Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. \"We're trying to ascertain if we've had a peak in supply-chain issues. . .[and whether] this might be as bad as it gets.\"</p><p>On Monday, supermarket chain Albertsons reported higher sales, with executives saying consumers are still spending heavily on groceries. The Boise, Idaho, company is passing on some price increases to customers but said that it is offering cheaper alternatives. Its shares rose 95 cents, or 3.3%, to $29.51.</p><p>This week, investors will receive earnings results from companies including Procter &amp; Gamble, Netflix and American Airlines.</p><p>Data released Monday by the Federal Reserve showed that U.S. industrial production -- a measure of factory, mining and utility output -- pulled back in September, falling 1.3% from the previous month. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a 0.2% increase.</p><p>New data Monday also showed China's economy grew by 4.9% in the third quarter from a year prior, a sharp slowdown from the second quarter's 7.9%.</p><p>In the U.S., Tesla, which reports earnings this week, added $27.08, or 3.2%, to $870.11. Facebook gained $10.58, or 3.3%, to $335.34. Twitter advanced $2.07, or 3.3%, to $64.84.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude futures, the benchmark in global oil markets, ticked down 0.6% to $84.33 a barrel.</p><p>Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value, gained 3.3% from its 5 p.m. ET level Sunday to $61,414.16 at 4:30 p.m. ET.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 1.583% from 1.574% Friday.
