  "text": "<p>Reckitt Benckiser has warned that a boom in demand for disinfectants and surface cleaners has moderated while commodity cost pressures have intensified, sending shares in the household products group sharply lower.</p> <p>The FTSE 100 company had been one of the corporate winners from the pandemic as households turned to its brands including Dettol, Lysol and Cillit Bang to try to prevent the spread of Covid-19.</p> <p>However, shares in Reckitt dropped almost 9 per cent on Tuesday after the Slough-based company said customer demand for cleaning supplies had peaked. While sales of its Durex condoms and other products dependent on social mixing had picked up as coronavirus restrictions were relaxed, the company said it expected a “slower” third quarter. </p> <p>Laxman Narasimhan, chief executive, said that much of the public still had elevated concerns about germs, especially on public transport and other places outside the home.</p> <p>But he added that there had recently “been a moderation in that concern, particularly in the house”, in part because of the rollout of coronavirus vaccines.</p> <p>While revenues remain comfortably above pre-pandemic levels, the group's like-for-like sales for the three months to June 30 dipped unexpectedly, down 1 per cent from a year ago.</p> <p>Operating profit margins, meanwhile, declined 2.9 percentage points in the first half of the year to 21.6 per cent, which Reckitt said partly reflected higher costs of paper, plastic and other commodities.</p> <p>“We're seeing inflation across the board,” Narasimhan said. Reckitt planned to pull several “levers” to minimise the impact — including efficiency savings and potentially passing on higher prices to consumers — but these would “take time” to offset the higher expenses.</p> <p>Other companies in the sector, including Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble, have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d246d96-3d10-4e97-991a-1fe254944396\">also said</a> that the costs of raw materials, packaging and transport are increasing.</p> <p>“A lot of this is driven by massive demand and stimulus money,” Narasimhan said. “My hope is that over a 12, 18-month period we'll see more of a normalisation of some of these [trends].”</p> <p>Reckitt fell to a first-half pre-tax loss of £1.94bn, compared with a profit of £1.44bn a year ago, as it took a £3bn hit from the agreed sale last month of its baby formula interests in China.</p> <p>The business was part of Mead Johnson, which Reckitt acquired in 2017 in a £13bn deal and whose results subsequently disappointed investors.</p> <p>Reckitt's first-half revenues dipped from £6.9bn a year ago to £6.6bn, with the group adding that the third quarter would be “slower due to strong prior year comparators, as the world gradually opens up and socialisation returns”.</p> <p>The company also said its line of cold and flu remedies, which include the Lemsip and Strepsils brands, should support its fourth-quarter results.</p> <p>Social distancing during the pandemic had prevented the spread of regular ailments as well as Covid, reducing demand for such products, but Reckitt said these were “starting to show positive momentum” and sales should improve during flu season.</p> <p>Narasimhan added that he was “encouraged by the progress” the company had made despite a “challenging environment”.</p> <p>The board recommended the interim dividend be held steady, at 73p a share.</p><p>Source: Alistair Gray 2021 'Reckitt Benckiser shares hit as boom in cleaning products moderates' FT.com 27 July.
