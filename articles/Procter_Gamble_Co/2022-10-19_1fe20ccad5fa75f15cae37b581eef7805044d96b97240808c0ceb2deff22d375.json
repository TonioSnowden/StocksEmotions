  "text": "<p>US stocks dipped on Wednesday as investors weighed mixed corporate earnings and signs of persistent inflationary pressures.</p> <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 gauge closed 0.7 per cent lower, reversing course after two days of solid gains. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ceded 0.9 per cent. In Europe, the regional Stoxx 600 closed 0.5 per cent lower.</p> <p>Consumer goods groups Procter &amp; Gamble and Nestlé became the latest companies to highlight the effect of inflation as they reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday.</p> <p>Both groups reported falling sales volumes in the three months to September, and Nestlé chief executive Mark Schneider said the Swiss group would lift prices further to pay for higher energy and labour costs. Ohio-based P&amp;G took an additional hit from the strength of the dollar.</p> <p>Investors are paying close attention to corporate guidance on pricing levels and the effect of higher costs. Central banks led by the US Federal Reserve have been aggressively tightening monetary policy this year in an effort to rein in price rises, but the speed and scale of the changes have raised fears that economies will be pushed into recession.</p> <p>The Fed has increased borrowing costs by 0.75 percentage points at each of its past three meetings, taking its target range to 3 to 3.25 per cent, and is expected to do the same again at its next meeting.</p> <p>In the UK, data published earlier on Wednesday showed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/uk-inflation\">annual inflation</a> accelerated in September to 10.1 per cent, up from 9.9 per cent in August, on the back of higher food prices. The latest reading for the consumer price index was higher than the 10 per cent consensus among economists polled by Reuters.</p> <p>Away from the consumer sector, earnings reports have been mixed. Shares in Netflix jumped 13 per cent on Wednesday after it published positive results after Tuesday's closing bell. The streaming group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3b63a57-0d46-41c7-8f6b-c61d388db039\">shocked investors in April</a> when it revealed that subscriber growth had gone into reverse, but on Tuesday said it had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b1e8a70-73e0-40a9-bd7d-7dcd6e015c42\">stemmed its subscriber losses</a> in the third quarter. Popular programmes such as <em>Stranger Things</em> had helped it add 2.4mn subscribers, more than double the number forecast by the streaming group.</p> <p>Healthcare group Abbott Laboratories, in contrast, dropped 6.5 per cent as the strong dollar weighed on its international sales.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 was still in positive territory for the week after a strong Monday and Tuesday, but Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note that “we do not expect a sustained turnround anytime soon”.</p> <p>“In fact, the risk-reward outlook for markets has become unfavourable in the near term, in our view, reflecting a combination of persistent inflation, rising rates, falling growth estimates, and heightened financial stress.”</p> <p>In government debt markets, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose 0.13 percentage points to 4.13 per cent as the price of the instrument fell. </p> <p>The equivalent 10-year UK yield fell 0.03 percentage points to 3.88 per cent. The 30-year gilt yield slid more than 0.2 percentage points to sit just below 4 per cent for the first time in more than two weeks, according to Tradeweb data, following a decision from the Bank of England to exclude longer-dated debt when it begins bond sales next month.</p> <p>The pound shed 0.9 per cent against the dollar to $1.12, while the greenback added 0.7 per cent against a basket of six peers. The yen touched a new 32-year low against the US currency of ¥149.89.</p> <p>The Japanese currency has fallen more than 20 per cent this year, its decline fuelled by a widening gulf between the ultra-loose monetary policy of the Bank of Japan and the tightening trend exhibited by many other global central banks.</p><p>Source: Harriet Clarfelt in London and Nicholas Megaw in New York 2022 'Stocks turn lower as inflation concerns temper earnings' FT.com 19 October.
