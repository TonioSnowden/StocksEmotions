  "title": "The Blind Climber, the Coding Evangelist and Others Who Inspire Unilever's Former CEO; Before he led a consumer-goods giant, Paul Polman wanted to be a priest or a doctor. Now he's working to combat climate change and poverty, and looking to the examples set by his personal board of directors.",
  "text": "<p>The inevitable tensions between wanting to help people and working in business where profit-making is primary have played out throughout Mr. Polman's career. He says nowadays, approaching business through the lens of having a positive impact on the world isn't just possible but increasingly necessary for brands to have staying power. \"The role of business in society is definitely evolving, moving from a more narrow shareholder-primacy focus to a bigger role in society,\" he says.</p><p>One of six children growing up in a Catholic family in the Netherlands, Mr. Polman credits his mother, a schoolteacher who was \"an example of what good citizenship is about,\" for his early desire to better people's lives.</p><p>Bio Bits</p><p>Paul Polman, former CEO of Unilever</p><p>* Age: 65</p><p>* Education: B.A. in economics, University of Groningen; M.A. and M.B.A., University of Cincinnati</p><p>* Family: Wife, Kim Polman, and three adult sons</p><p>* Healthy hobby: Running marathons</p><p>* Early calling: As a child, he wanted to become a priest</p><p>* First job: Worked as a milkman at the age of 14</p><p>But the Dutchman's plan to become a doctor went awry after he twice failed to win the lottery that in Holland decided who went to medical school. So Mr. Polman, at his father's suggestion, flew to Cincinnati in 1977 with the intention of taking a job at a tire factory and improving his English. Once he arrived, he decided instead to apply to graduate school. \"I changed my strategy on the spot,\" he says. \"I knocked on the doors of several universities and they said 'You must be kidding, you don't have any money, you don't have any grades.' \"</p><p>Eventually, he got a student assistantship at the University of Cincinnati that came with a tuition waiver and allowed him to pursue a master's degree in economics, all while working a weekend job in maintenance to make ends meet. He later added on an M.B.A. in finance.</p><p>Being in Cincinnati, the home of Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Mr. Polman sent his résumé to the Tide detergent owner when he began looking for a job and was quickly hired. \"They were looking for Europeans with MBAs,\" he says. \"There was a premium on people with MBAs in those days.\"</p><p>He returned to Europe, settling in Belgium with his American wife—whom he had met in a collective bargaining class at the University of Cincinnati—to do cost accounting and forecasting at a P&amp;G factory there. The next couple of decades saw Mr. Polman bounce from Belgium to the Netherlands to France to Spain to the U.K. and then back to the U.S. to run P&amp;G's global laundry business.</p><p>Mr. Polman's last P&amp;G job was in Geneva, running the company's European business for five years. Nearing 50, he considered retiring from corporate life. \"I was still pondering the question of whether I belonged in business or not,\" he says.</p><p>Instead, he joined Nestle SA in 2006, after then-CEO Peter Brabeck-Letmathe offered him the job of chief financial officer. \"My wife was adamant that I wouldn't become a CFO because she had the impression that all the CFOs end up in jail,\" says Mr. Polman, who recalls the era as one marked by accounting scandals. He accepted the job anyway. \"I like to be stretched.\"</p><p>After being passed over for the top job at Nestlé a couple of years later, Mr. Polman was approached by Unilever to be its CEO. He took the reins of the owner of Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream and Suave shampoo in 2009, becoming perhaps its most iconic leader and certainly its most colorful.</p><p>Early on he scrapped earnings guidance and quarterly reporting, telling investors that if they weren't interested in sustainable, long-term value creation they could take their money elsewhere. He announced a plan to double revenue while halving the company's environmental impact.</p><p>During Mr. Polman's decade as CEO—during which time he made over 50 acquisitions, fended off a hostile takeover approach from Kraft Heinz Co. and tried and failed to simplify Unilever's structure by consolidating its headquarters in Rotterdam—Unilever's shares had a total return of about 270%.</p><p>Since leaving the company in 2019, he's set up his own firm focused on galvanizing corporations to combat climate change and poverty and has written a book called \"Net Positive: How Courageous Companies Thrive by Giving More Than They Take.\" It will be released in early October.</p><p>Mr. Polman sees his board of directors as people he looks to less for direct advice and more for inspiration. Here are four of them:</p><p>Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala</p><p>Director-General of the World Trade Organization</p><p>Ms. Okonjo-Iweala and Mr. Polman built a rapport after they both began working for the B Team, a global nonprofit co-founded by British entrepreneur Richard Branson, in 2013. At the time Ms. Okonjo-Iweala was the finance minister for Nigeria and Mr. Polman was taken by her tenacity. \"She's a go-getter, she won't let go,\" says Mr. Polman of Ms. Okonjo-Iweala, who is the first woman and first African to serve as director-general of the WTO.</p><p>Mr. Polman credits her influence for his decision to prioritize investing in Africa while he was the CEO of Unilever. She's helped shape his views on climate change—with the pair working together on a global initiative examining how countries can achieve economic growth while dealing with the risks posed by the changing climate—and more recently his views on how governments can build back better after the pandemic.</p><p>\"She looks at this whole thing more holistically from a human development point of view. It's about poverty alleviation and inclusion, not just climate change,\" he says. \"She has been, and continues to be, a great influence on me.\"</p><p>Marieme Jamme</p><p>President and Founder of IamtheCODE</p><p>Mr. Polman got to know Ms. Jamme in 2017 in New York after Unicef asked him to present her with an award for helping women and girls globally learn to code.</p><p>The Senagelese-born Ms. Jamme was raped and trafficked as a child, before eventually finding her way to the U.K., where she taught herself to read and write at the age of 16 and learned to code using her local library.</p><p>Her story inspired Mr. Polman, who invited her to talk to Unilever's top 500 executives \"to open minds and open mind-sets,\" he says. Several executives at Unilever became involved in helping Ms. Jamme expand her coding project and Mr. Polman has stayed in touch with her since.</p><p>\"To me it is motivating…it unleashes energy,\" he says of her journey. Mr. Polman admires Ms. Jamme's ability to maintain a positive attitude and focus on helping others.</p><p>\"She shows you how things have to happen on the ground, grass roots, and how it's people who make the difference,\" he says. She brings a perspective that is \"based on real life experience, that is incredibly valuable.\"</p><p>Nicholas Stern</p><p>Professor at the London School of Economics</p><p>Mr. Polman first met Mr. Stern shortly after the professor published a key report on climate change in 2006. Over the years the pair's paths crossed frequently, as co-chairs of the same global initiative Mr. Polman led with Ms. Okonjo-Iweala and and while working together for the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference.</p><p>\"In many of these activities Nick and I were joined at the hip and it was a very productive partnership,\" says Mr. Polman.</p><p>He describes Mr. Stern as a \"very good friend\" but also a role model who he turns to for advice on how governments, companies, nonprofits and others can work together to tackle climate change.</p><p>\"Every time I talk to him or every time I listen to him I learn something,\" said Mr. Polman. \"He has this ability to distill that complexity into simplicity.\"</p><p>Erik Weihenmayer</p><p>Athlete, adventurer, author, activist and motivational speaker</p><p>Mr. Polman first met Mr. Weihenmayer almost two decades ago after reading the blind athlete's book, \"Touch the Top of the World.\" It tells the story of how Mr. Weihenmayer, who was born with a degenerative eye disease and went blind at the age of 13, became the first blind person to reach the summit of Mount Everest in 2001.</p><p>Mr. Polman, who says he makes a practice of phoning authors whose books he enjoys, invited Mr. Weihenmayer to Geneva to speak to his team at P&amp;G. \"At that time our business was not doing so well, I had just been appointed, and I thought he could motivate the people because he saw no limits,\" he said.</p><p>While in town, Mr. Weihenmayer stayed at Mr. Polman's house for a couple of nights, making an impression on the whole family, and in particular his sons.</p><p>A couple of years later, Mr. Polman and two of his sons joined Mr. Weihenmayer and seven other blind people from around the world to climb Mount Kilimanjaro and visit schools for the blind in the area. \"I felt the urgent need to leave a legacy from this trip,\" says Mr. Polman. \"That was an experience that stayed with me.\"</p><p>Over the next few years Mr. Polman organized fundraising events for the blind and set up a foundation to help support and educate visually impaired children in East Africa. Through the years, Mr. Weihenmayer \"has helped, he has mentored, he has provided advice,\" says Mr. Polman.</p><p>\"I feel he's made me a better person by just being who he is and being so optimistic despite all the challenges he has had to deal with,\" says Mr. Polman.</p><p>Write to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com</p><p>The Blind Climber, the Coding Evangelist and Others Who Inspire Unilever's Former CEO</p>",
