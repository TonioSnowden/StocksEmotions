  "text": "<p>Boston-based Whele LLC, known as Perch, for example, was formed in 2019 and has raised more than $900 million, from SoftBank Vision Fund 2 and others, to acquire Amazon third-party and other direct-to-consumer brands. Perch sells products in categories including apparel and beauty, home and kitchen, and health and wellness.</p><p>New York-based Intrinsic is betting its sector expertise will convince many small-business owners in the health-and-wellness category that it is the best fit for their products, including ones sold over-the-counter for pregnancy and baby care, eye care and healthy aging. The Food and Drug Administration regulates the ingredients in these products, their manufacturing, and claims companies make on their labels, said Yadin Shemmer, Intrinsic's co-founder and chief executive.</p><p>\"The industry we're in has a few very unique characteristics we think require specialization,\" Mr. Shemmer said.</p><p>U.S. retail e-commerce sales of health, personal care and beauty products totaled $44.8 billion in 2018, research firm eMarketer said in a 2019 report. It projected sales would rise to $85.52 billion next year.</p><p>Consumers are thinking more about how to improve their health outside their doctor visits, creating opportunities for developers of new health-and-wellness goods, said Lynne Chou O'Keefe, managing partner at Define Ventures, which led the Series A equity portion of Intrinsic's new financing.</p><p>Mr. Shemmer declined to disclose the breakdown of the financing's equity and debt. Because Intrinsic seeks profitable brands, lenders are willing to provide capital for acquisitions, he said.</p><p>Many small businesses selling on Amazon reach a few million dollars in revenue and then plateau, Mr. Shemmer said. They might not have enough experience in matters such as supply-chain management or marketing to keep growing, or may simply lack the capital to expand, he said.</p><p>Intrinsic, which Mr. Shemmer founded in January with Redesign Health Inc., a firm that builds healthcare companies, has hired professionals with experience at companies such as Colgate-Palmolive Co. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. in growing health-and-wellness consumer brands.</p><p>Mr. Shemmer previously led startup Mango Health, whose app lets patients track and manage their medications. TrialCard Inc., which provides patient-support and other services on behalf of biopharmaceutical companies, acquired Mango Health in 2019.</p><p>Mr. Shemmer said he prefers to acquire a company's assets, instead of the entire business, to avoid taking on liabilities such as debt and litigation.</p><p>Intrinsic plans to use various tactics to increase sales of assets it acquires. It can, for example, diversify marketing to channels beyond Amazon, such as the websites of other retailers. The startup also can optimize supply chains and inventories, Mr. Shemmer said.</p><p>Creators of health-and-wellness products are often physicians or consumers seeking to improve upon the status quo, and aren't just in business to make money, he added. Part of Intrinsic's pitch to entrepreneurs is that it has the experience in matters such as the regulation of health-and-wellness products, and how consumers buy them, to be good stewards of their assets, Mr. Shemmer said.</p><p>Intrinsic has made its first few acquisitions and expects to use the funding from Define, Link Ventures, and others to buy 30 to 50 additional brands over the next 18 to 24 months. Mr. Shemmer declined to disclose the names of Intrinsic's initial purchases, but said they include a digestive-health supplement and an oral hygiene product for children. Each of the purchases was for less than $5 million, he said.</p><p>Small buyouts of a few million dollars are often significant for people who start such small businesses, Mr. Shemmer said, noting \"In many cases it's life-changing for these owners.\"</p>",
