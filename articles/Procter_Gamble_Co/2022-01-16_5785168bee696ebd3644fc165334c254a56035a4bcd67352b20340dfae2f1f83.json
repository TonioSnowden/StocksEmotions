  "text": "<p>GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer are holding out for an improved bid of at least £60bn for their consumer healthcare joint venture, bolstered by shareholder opposition to Unilever's £50bn offer.</p> <p>GSK <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30070969-71bc-4ef9-a035-45d589b6fefe\">dismissed Unilever's bid</a> on Saturday as “fundamentally undervalued”, as it revealed improved forecasts for the business. </p> <p>A 25 per cent premium to the estimated value of the business — which would push a bid above £60bn — would warrant serious consideration from the board, according to one person close to Pfizer. Another person familiar with the matter said it would be “hard to turn down”.&#xa0;</p> <p>GSK had been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/887a20d2-4d72-4ce0-8722-4883a6420233\">planning to spin off the unit</a>, in which it holds a 68 per cent stake, but has been under pressure to consider a sale, including from US hedge fund <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38345e7a-a93c-4bcc-bce0-bf8e2410bf74\">Elliott Management</a>.</p> <p>Marco Taricco, co-chief investment officer at Bluebell Capital Partners, another activist investor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/539c077d-6ac2-4e79-9e0f-8080a31c5530\">pushing for GSK</a> to consider a sale, said: “Based on the limited information we have so far, £50bn sounds like a floor, but it should be&#xa0;improved, either by Unilever or by someone else.”</p> <p>Richard Buxton at Jupiter Capital Management, a top-30 shareholder in GSK, said the company should proceed with a spin-off as the consumer health unit has a “great future as an independent company which can re-rate over time as the market understands it better”.</p> <p>“The idea of letting the goons at Unilever run it is laughable . . . There is no price at which I would want to sell it to them,” he said.</p> <p>The two sides are battling over the consumer company's valuation and have different views on the premium already offered, according to people familiar with the situation.</p> <p>GSK's guidance of 4 to 6 per cent growth in the medium term is higher than many analysts' estimates of about 3 to 4 per cent, which could prompt them to increase their valuations from the current range of about £37bn to £48bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Unilever's approach could spur other suitors, said people briefed on the matter. Procter &amp; Gamble has been considering adding more consumer healthcare assets to its portfolio of products, they said. But it has not made an offer and could decide to target Johnson &amp; Johnson's consumer healthcare assets, which the US company decided to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aee9304c-959a-4b92-a8d9-af93ad152af4\">spin-off in November</a>.</p> <p>A competitive offer for the GSK/Pfizer business would be based on a multiple to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in the high teens, potential synergies of 14 to 15 per cent and a premium of at least 25 per cent, according to a person familiar with the owners' thinking. </p> <p>The consumer unit's ebitda is forecast to hit £2.7bn in 2022, so the base valuation would be about £48.6bn to £51.3bn. Synergies on revenue of £9.6bn would add another £1.3bn to £1.4bn. The premium would be a minimum of £12bn, making a total acquisition price of £61.5bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>But GSK's board will also need to weigh other factors including tax and timing. One former board member said one of the spin-off's attractions was that it was meant to be tax-free. A sale would probably mean that both GSK and its shareholders were saddled with a tax bill, although there may be ways to mitigate this. </p> <p>“I doubt GSK will want to be deflected from a demerger,” he said. </p> <p>The spin-off was planned for mid-2022 but a sale of this scale would take longer. Regulators would review the transaction even though there is no obvious significant overlap between the two companies. </p> <p>Unilever may struggle to mount a significantly higher bid, with concerns it could be left hobbled by debt. Bruno Monteyne, analyst at Bernstein, said: “Unilever&#xa0;already has relatively high leverage, and by paying largely in cash, you would have a highly levered new company that would have to focus for years&#xa0;on paying debt rather than driving growth.”</p> <p>Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo warned that an all-cash deal for £55bn would bring debt to a “prohibitive” 5 times ebitda.</p><p>Source: Hannah Kuchler, Harriet Agnew and Judith Evans in London and James Fontanella-Khan in New York 2022 'GSK and Pfizer hold out for £60bn bid for consumer health unit' FT.com 16 January.
