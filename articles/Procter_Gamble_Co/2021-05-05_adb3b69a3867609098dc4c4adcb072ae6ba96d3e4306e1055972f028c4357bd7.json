It will be the biggest test to date of Facebook's 20-member oversight board, made up of academics, civil rights groups and experts across the political spectrum. </p> <p><em>Follow the latest news, including the decision, </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/world/us\"><em>on our website</em></a><em>.</em> <em>And</em> <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/subscribe?newsletterIds=56a64b704f693a0300dfab7e To enable screen reader support, press Ctrl+Alt+Z To learn about keyboard shortcuts, press Ctrl+slash\"><em>sign up here</em></a><em> for Swamp Notes, where Rana Foroohar and Edward Luce discuss the intersection of money and power in US politics</em></p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Money, museum tickets and even marijuana are up for grabs as <strong>US states</strong> and companies try to <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/138f58a1-b472-452a-9daa-db0f5c885079\">entice hesitant people</a> to get vaccinated.</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78a4fb15-c4d3-4193-b638-52d9d9caaa6c\">India's foreign minister is self-isolating</a> after two members of the country's delegation to the G7 meetings in London tested positive for coronavirus. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3da16e0d-bc3e-4e8e-a4b3-fa88427f2f7a\">Emergency medical aid</a>, meanwhile, is pouring into <strong>India</strong> from around the world as the government seeks to fend off criticism of its distribution. </p></li>  <li><p>The <strong>UK </strong>is to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f81e5ce-cdd1-464f-aa8e-57622bf814c9\">double the capacity</a> of laboratories testing vaccines against coronavirus strains.
