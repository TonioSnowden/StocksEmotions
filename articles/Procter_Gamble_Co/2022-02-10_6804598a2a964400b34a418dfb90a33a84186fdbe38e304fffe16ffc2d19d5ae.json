  "title": "Unilever's Turnaround Hopes Clash With Inflation; Maker of Ben & Jerry's ice cream says profit margins will take a much bigger hit from higher input costs than expected",
  "text": "<p>Unilever is under pressure after years of weak performance and a surprise $68 billion bid for GlaxoSmithKlein's consumer healthcare business that caused a shareholder revolt last month. Activist investor Nelson Peltz has taken a stake, although his Trian Partners fund hasn't commented publicly on the size of its holding or the company's predicament.</p><p>Mr. Jope said repeatedly on the quarterly results call that big acquisitions were now off the table. He also ruled out selling its low-growth food division, a move he had hinted at to help fund the Glaxo deal.</p><p>This will force Unilever to mend its existing business at a time when household brands globally face inflationary pressures. Procter &amp; Gamble said last month that its costs would increase by $2.8 billion in its current fiscal year, and warned shoppers to expect higher bills at the grocery store.</p><p>Unilever's crunch will be more severe. Its net material inflation, which measures higher costs minus the impact of hedging and other actions such as product reformulations, will increase to 3.6 billion euros in 2022, equivalent to $4.1 billion at today's exchange rates. In 2020, net inflation in Unilever's cost base was just 100 million euros.</p><p>The margin cut shows that Unilever thinks it can pass on some but not all of this to shoppers. Without any increase in prices, the hit to margins could be three times as much. Still, the new guidance raises questions about the health of Unilever's brands and the emerging-markets consumers they often serve. Procter &amp; Gamble, whose portfolio is more skewed toward developed economies, last month said its gross margins would continue to rise, despite inflation.</p><p>At Unilever, sales increased by a better-than-expected 4.9% for the three months through December. But all of that came from price increases necessary to keep up with inflation and devaluing emerging-market exchange rates. The amount of goods sold was flat, and in Latin America, successive price increases led to a 4.8% dip in regional volumes for the quarter.</p><p>Unilever expects operating margins to fully recover by 2024, and a new organizational structure that kicks in from July should lower costs by 600 million euros over two years and improve sales growth.</p><p>Shareholders got the kind of margin reset normally only attempted by a new management team. This could provoke Mr. Peltz, who previously sat on Procter &amp; Gamble's board, to make his thoughts about Unilever and its leadership public. Whether Mr. Jopes goes or stays, inflation will only make the company's turnaround more challenging.</p><p>Write to Carol Ryan at carol.ryan@wsj.com</p><p>Unilever's Turnaround Hopes Clash With Inflation</p>",
