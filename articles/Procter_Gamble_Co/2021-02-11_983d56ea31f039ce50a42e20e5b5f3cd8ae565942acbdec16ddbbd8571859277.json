  "text": "<p>A large shareholder in French consumer goods group Danone has called on its board to make governance reforms and overhaul its leadership, echoing demands made last month by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2df158fb-357a-499a-b51c-025b4f1d5c97\">activist fund</a> Bluebell Capital Partners. </p> <p>Artisan Partners said it was Danone's third-largest holder owning a stake worth about&#xa0;$1.6bn via two funds, or more than 3 per cent of the company. Data from Capital IQ and Refinitiv showed Artisan funds holding a smaller stake worth roughly $325m at the end of last year. </p> <p>The move is likely to increase pressure on Danone chief executive and chairman Emmanuel Faber, who has been criticised by some investors for the poor financial performance of the group that makes Activia yoghurt and Evian bottled water. Danone is set to report annual results on February 19. </p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/letter-from-artisan-global-value-strategy-and-artisan-international-value-strategy-to-gilles-schnepp-lead-independent-board-member-elect-at-danone-inc-301226405.html?tc=eml_cleartime\">the open letter</a> addressed to lead independent director Gilles Schnepp, Artisan said Danone had “one of the best collections of assets in the global food industry” but its results had lagged “on almost every measure” in recent years, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. </p> <p>The US fund manager also took direct aim at Faber by saying the roles of chief executive and chairman should be separated. It called for more independent voices to be added to the board to the “exclusion of former company management”, an apparent reference to Cécile Cabanis, the one-time chief financial officer of Danone who was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e17e18b4-aa24-4e24-9ae6-9322cdfbc544\">recently nominated</a> to join the board as vice-chairman. </p> <p>Artisan has enlisted Jan Bennink, an experienced consumer industry executive who earlier worked in Danone's dairy and medical nutrition businesses, to help it craft a proposal on how to turn round the company. </p> <p>“Our plan is based on fundamental, long-term growth and value creation. It is not based on financial engineering, a break-up of the business or the sale of the company,” they wrote.</p> <p>Artisan cast itself as a long-term investor, which rarely agitated for change publicly at the companies in which it invested. It said it was not working with Bluebell Capital, a London-based hedge fund&#xa0;that has called for Faber to be replaced. </p> <p>Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said Artisan's declarations were notable given it was a bigger money manager than Bluebell Capital: “The board cannot ignore this. It's an important sign, a serious investor and carefully written letter.”</p> <p>The spat comes at a difficult time for the French company as it grapples with the fallout from the pandemic. Its bottled water business has suffered during lockdowns, depriving it of its most profitable sales at restaurants, bars and convenience stores. The once fast-growing infant formula unit has also slowed because of lower birth rates and consumers in the key Chinese market opting for more local brands. </p> <p>Meanwhile the cost of transport, raw materials and logistics has crept up because of the health crisis, sapping profits. Analysts expect 2020 sales to have fallen 6 per cent to €23.7bn, according to Refinitiv estimates, and net income to be down 23 per cent to €1.1bn.</p> <p>Its results in the past year have lagged larger consumer goods rivals such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66cc51f4-1ec3-4299-a7a7-ba152917947b\">Unilever</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a7241ac-ce49-409a-a894-5bceec88f4fa\">Procter &amp; Gamble</a>, which have benefited from strong growth at their household and cleaning products businesses.</p> <p>Danone said: “We welcome all investments and value constructive views on how we deliver long-term sustainable value,” adding that it “has already taken significant steps to reinforce its governance”.</p> <p>Faber has promised to sell underperforming brands, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e88597c2-6257-4580-93a2-c6dd25065617\">cut up to 2,000 jobs,</a> and embark on a reorganisation of the group's structure along more geographical lines.</p> <p>In reaction to Artisan's announcement, Danone's shares rose 3 per cent in early trading — before Thursday they were down about 28 per cent in the past year. P&amp;G is up 3 per cent and Unilever is down 16 per cent. </p><p>Source: Leila Abboud in Paris 2021 'Second Danone shareholder calls for leadership overhaul ' FT.com 11 February.
