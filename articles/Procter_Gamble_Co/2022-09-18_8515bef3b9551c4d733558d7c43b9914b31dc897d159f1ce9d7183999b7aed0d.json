  "title": "Clayton Dubilier & Rice Banks $10 Billion So Far for Latest Buyout Fund; The New York private-equity firm began formal marketing efforts for the fund just four months ago with a $20 billion goal",
  "text": "<p>A crowded fundraising market and declines in publicly traded stocks have left many private-equity investors increasingly reliant on established fund managers and with little room in their portfolios for new entrants. More than half of 71 institutional investors surveyed late last year by placement agent Probitas Partners said that maintaining relationships with established managers returning to market was a main driver of their interest in private equity, up from only 10% in a similar survey the previous year.</p><p>Investors that have backed the new fund so far include the Tampa, Fla., General Employees' Retirement Fund and the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, according to public disclosures.</p><p>Founded in 1978, Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice invests across North America and Europe, focusing on businesses in sectors such as healthcare, consumer and retail, industrials, technology, and business and financial services, according to its website. Earlier this year, the firm acquired a majority stake in certain hospice and personal-care divisions of healthcare giant Humana Inc., which CD&amp;R has combined into a stand-alone company called Gentiva Health Services Inc.</p><p>As CD&amp;R has been pitching its new fund, the firm also has been beefing up its professional team. The roughly 125 professionals at CD&amp;R include a group of at least 33 advisers that the firm calls on to help with portfolio company operations, according to its website.</p><p>Recent hires include Operating Advisor Michael Lamach, the former chief executive of climate-control company Trane Technologies, and Senior Operating Advisor David Taylor, former chair and chief executive of consumer-products maker Procter &amp; Gamble. The firm also recently hired David Winokur, a former managing director of private-equity firm TowerBrook Capital Partners, as a partner on its investment team to help build its portfolio of financial-services companies.</p><p>Write to Laura Kreutzer at laura.kreutzer@wsj.com</p>",
