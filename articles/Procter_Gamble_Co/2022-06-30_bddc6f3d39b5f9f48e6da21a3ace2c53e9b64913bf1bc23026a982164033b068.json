  "text": "<p>Reckitt Benckiser cannot seem to catch a break. The planned sale of its infant formula business, <a href=\"https://www.meadjohnson.com/news/press-releases/mead-johnson-nutrition-agrees-be-acquired-reckitt-benckiser\">acquired</a> from Mead Johnson in 2017, looks set to be ambushed by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/68c69fad-85bb-4fa6-946d-f314a0c15119\">politics</a>. A formula shortage in the US, set off by a shuttered Abbott Laboratories factory, has highlighted the sector's oligopolistic nature. A sale to private equity while emergency supplies are being airlifted in to the US has drawn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69df9ca6-9ac0-4f8c-833b-01f6eaff3200\">criticism</a>.</p> <p>The once&#xa0;lean, clean M&amp;A machine morphed into a serial issuer of profit warnings under Rakesh Kapoor. His successor, Laxman Narasimhan, set about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cd66d06-72b4-476a-a4e0-30b5a454bc07\">righting the ship</a>. He jettisoned the China formula business, selling it to private equity for $2.2bn last year. He sacrificed short term profitability to invest in R&amp;D and marketing, resetting margins in 2020 down 350 basis points from 2019 and targeting a return to mid-20s levels by 2025.</p> <p>Narasimhan had timing on his side. Makers of hygiene and cleaning products were pandemic beneficiaries. He beefed up spending before the current headwinds of input inflation and snagged supply chains dented sector profitability. </p> <p>Given strong sales, a bull case can be made for keeping the infant formula unit. Yet that highlights Reckitt's weakness, and a key reason for valuation that trails the bulk of its peer group. On a forward price/earnings multiple of 20 times it lags Colgate-Palmolive and Procter &amp; Gamble of the US.</p> <p>Reckitt is a lumpy beast. Upcoming second-half results will inevitably show strength in sales of formula, measured on a like for like basis. But expect the shine to come off pandemic stars like Lysol and Dettol disinfectants on the same metric. Hygiene was 45 per cent of net sales last year.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, Reckitt's guidance for 2022 organic sales growth at the upper end of 1-4 per cent may climb. But caution will serve the group well. A cost of living crisis in developed markets could cause shifts into cheaper private labels. One lesson from the old guard: better to under promise and over deliver than vice versa.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Reckitt Benckiser: infant formula sale is in jeopardy but sales are rising ' FT.com 30 June.
