  "text": "<p>Unilever pushed up prices for its products by more than 4 per cent in the third quarter as the global consumer goods group battled input cost inflation that it warned would worsen next year.</p> <p>Price rises of 4.1 per cent helped the maker of brands including Dove soap, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Magnum ice cream, to counteract falling sales volumes and slightly exceed expectations for the three months to September. On Thursday, it reported underlying sales growth of 2.5 per cent and turnover of €13.5bn.</p> <p>“It is a once in two-decade scenario that we are seeing . . . [and] we haven't reached peak inflation yet,” said Alan Jope, chief executive. “We see inflationary pressures continuing through the first half of next year.”</p> <p>The UK-based group faces a tough task in managing cost inflation as its sales are dominated by emerging markets, where rising prices for energy, freight and raw materials such as palm oil are having a particularly strong impact.</p> <p>Unilever is among many consumer goods groups to accelerate price rises in the second half of the year. Its increases were greater than those reported by rival foodmaker Nestlé, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b61265c-b8ea-4ee3-8ba5-222274426aa8\">said </a>on Wednesday it had lifted prices 2.1 per cent in the third quarter.</p> <p>Procter &amp; Gamble is also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0118f98c-7361-4ea2-b643-93ee9a3389bf\">increasing </a>prices after forecasting $2.3bn of extra commodity and freight costs for the year. But globally branded goods face a challenge in raising prices without prompting consumers to switch to cheaper local products or supermarket own-brands.</p> <p>Unilever has been seeking to offset some cost rises with more than €2bn of efficiency savings this year, while Jope said: “We take an approach on pricing where it's the last thing we try to do, not the first thing.”</p> <p>Alicia Forry, analyst at Investec, said Unilever's pricing push was “proof that the company can price to protect its margins — which is a good thing in the current inflationary environment”. The group's price increases were particularly high in Asia and for homecare products globally, where price growth was 4.8 per cent.</p> <p>Jope is also under pressure to revive the company's share price, which has shed 18.9 per cent of its value over the past year. It rose 2.5 per cent in morning trading on Thursday to £39.15.</p> <p>Jope has been working to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3be09fce-432d-11ea-abea-0c7a29cd66fe\">sell or list</a> the company's tea division, now named Ekaterra, which generates revenues of about €2bn a year, excluding parts such as the Indian tea unit that Unilever plans to keep. Private equity groups including Carlyle and Advent have been bidding to buy Ekaterra.</p> <p>Sales of skincare, deodorants and ice creams sold outside the home increased, as large parts of the world loosened Covid-19 curbs. Unilever reported strong growth in the US, China and India but its performance in south-east Asia was weaker as countries there imposed lockdowns.</p> <p>Unilever said margins would be flat for the full year and underlying sales growth “well within” Jope's 3 to 5 per cent target range. Martin Deboo, analyst at Jefferies, said: “The underlying challenge remains the one of accelerating volume growth.”</p><p>Source: Judith Evans 2021 'Unilever raises prices as inflationary pressure bites ' FT.com 21 October.
