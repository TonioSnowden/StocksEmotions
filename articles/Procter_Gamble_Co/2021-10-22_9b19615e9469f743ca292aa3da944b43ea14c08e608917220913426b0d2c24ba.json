  "title": "Stocks Waver After S&P 500 Record; Investors parse earnings from American Express; technology companies slide",
  "text": "<p>All three major indexes are on track for weekly gains. The S&amp;P 500 is up 1.7% this week, while the Dow has added 1.1%. The Nasdaq is up 1.6%.</p><p>Stocks have risen in recent days after strong earnings results from some of the biggest U.S. corporations. Most S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported earnings have beat analysts' expectations, and corporate profits are expected to jump around 35% in the latest quarter from the prior year, according to Refinitiv data.</p><p>The latest financial results from companies like Tesla and Procter &amp; Gamble showed that companies have been able to insulate themselves from the global supply-chain crisis and deliver strong results. Some companies have been passing down higher prices to customers.</p><p>\"It's still a solid backdrop for the stock market,\" said Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. The S&amp;P 500 hit a fresh high on Thursday and was hovering around its record on Friday. Investors have also piled into bitcoin, sending prices to a high this week after the first bitcoin ETF started trading.</p><p>On Friday, American Express shares rose 5.1% after the credit-card company posted a rise in earnings that beat analysts forecasts, in part helped by more consumers dining out.</p><p>Snap shares fell 22.9% after the social-media company said changes to Apple's privacy rules would hurt its ad business. Other technology shares also slipped, with Facebook falling more than 5%, and Google parent company Alphabet down 2.6%.</p><p>Still, some companies are struggling with parts shortages. Intel shares fell more than 10% after the chip maker posted earnings late Thursday. Component shortages are weighing on Intel's computer shipments and China's gaming crackdown is hurting sales of chips used in servers.</p><p>Digital World Acquisition, the blank-check company taking former President Donald Trump's new social network public, more than doubled.</p><p>China Evergrande Group, the heavily indebted property giant whose potential default had spooked markets, made an overdue interest payment to international bondholders, Chinese state-owned media reported Friday. The payment allowed the company to stave off default and helped ease investors' broader concerns about China's property sector.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury rose to 1.679% Friday from 1.674% Thursday, its highest close in five months.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark rose 0.4% to $85.00 a barrel. Gold prices rose 1.8% to $1,813.50 a troy ounce.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600, rose 0.6%, led by its technology sector. Asian stock markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.3%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 0.4%, while in mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.3%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Gunjan Banerji at gunjan.banerji@wsj.com.</p><p>Stocks Waver After S&amp;P 500 Record</p>",
