  "text": "<p>High-end mixers maker Fever-Tree has warned its margins will take a hit from a spike in global transport and warehousing costs, sending its shares down as much as 7 per cent.</p> <p>The premium tonics, colas, sodas and lemonades brand said sales had risen strongly in the six months to the end of June, but that cost pressures were cutting into profitability, which had already been hit by the pandemic.</p> <p>“Whilst we anticipate some margin improvement next year, we believe logistic cost headwinds will continue alongside input cost increases on raw materials and product costs,” Fever-Tree said on Tuesday. </p> <p>Like-for-like revenues rose 32 per cent to £137.1m from a year earlier at the London-listed group. This was driven by steep increases in the US and continental Europe as bars and restaurants <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69f0c3b8-00ff-4065-a482-ebe00c6a890a\">began reopening</a> in many countries and as consumers snapped up mixers to accompany increasingly popular high-end spirits drunk at home.</p> <p>But logistics costs pushed the group's ebitda margin, a measure of profitability, down to about 20.5 per cent in the first half, a decline from 22.6 per cent in 2020 and 29.6 per cent in 2019 before the pandemic.</p> <p>Freight and US warehousing costs accounted for the biggest hit, said Tim Warrillow, chief executive.</p> <p>“There's no question the [raw] materials costs are a consideration and we imagine that will continue into next year, but it's nothing like as sharp an increase,” he added. “We see the profit crunch as relatively short term. We are very focused on the growth aspects of this business.”</p> <p>Fever-Tree, founded in 2005, is credited with overhauling a mixers market previously dominated by Coca-Cola-owned Schweppes. Its products, made with ingredients such as fresh green ginger from Ivory Coast, have sold rapidly alongside a growing consumer preference for spirits over wine and beer.</p> <p>But it joins other food and drinks makers in highlighting the impact of rising logistics and raw materials costs, which have already led to rising <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61346c2f-de96-4ad7-91c1-028efe4706ff\">inflation </a>in the UK and US.<br><br>Nestlé, Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever all recently set out plans for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a30e5c4-82f2-4070-9fa7-6769aca518fc\">price rises</a> following commodity price jumps and a spike in transport and packaging costs.</p> <p>Fever-Tree would resist big price increases to its products, which include a popular sparkling pink grapefruit juice drunk with tequila, said Warrillow.</p> <p>“Whilst we might have to pass through a bit of pricing, it's not going to be significant. We don't want to change the dynamic of growth we are seeing,” he added.</p> <p>Shares in the group were down 6.9 per cent to £22.80 by late morning, having dipped as low as £22.42 in earlier trading.</p><p>Source: Judith Evans 2021 'Rising costs take fizz out of Fever-Tree sales ' FT.com 20 July.
