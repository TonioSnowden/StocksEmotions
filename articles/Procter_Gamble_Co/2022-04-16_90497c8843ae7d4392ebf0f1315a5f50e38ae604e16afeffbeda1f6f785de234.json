  "text": "<p>At Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Durk Jager was known as a demanding boss who sometimes joked that he would break employees' kneecaps if they didn't follow his orders.</p><p>In January 1999, he became the first chief executive officer of P&amp;G born outside the U.S. His predecessor, John Pepper, said the Netherlands-born Mr. Jager personified \"the essential qualities that will be critical to realizing the goals and vision we are pursuing.\"</p><p>Seventeen months later, Mr. Jager's 30-year P&amp;G career was over. The board, alarmed by earnings shortfalls and a corporate reorganization that left employees confused and angry, handed the top job to A.G. Lafley, who said the company had \"changed too much too fast.\" P&amp;G's market value had fallen about $73 billion, or 50%.</p><p>Mr. Jager collected $9.5 million in severance pay and joined the boards of other companies, including Polycom Inc. and Chiquita Brands International Inc. He could still be blunt. When Mr. Jager resigned from Chiquita's board in 2010, he wrote that the banana company lacked the ability to address \"basic operational requirements for a sound business.\"</p><p>Mr. Jager died at home April 3 of what his family described as natural causes. He was 78.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
