  "text": "<p>   Paying more for diapers? Blame the Texas freeze. </p><p>   The February storm that closed chemical plants across Texas, hobbling production of goods from car parts to smartphones, continues to reverberate throughout the global supply chain. </p><p>   One product that remains in short supply is acrylic acid, the propylene-based compound that makes diapers absorbent. Executives and industry consultants say that shortfall is still a factor in the fast-rising prices of diapers even as demand declines. </p><p>   Suppliers of acrylic acid \"just got hammered,\" said Michael Murray, who with his two brothers runs DeSales Trading Co., a company that buys and sells so-called superabsorbent polymers made with acrylic acid. \"Supply is extremely tight right now.\" </p><p>   The global supply chain is in broad upheaval, upended by pandemic- and weather-related production disruptions, demand swings and surging raw materials costs. Diapers are one of many consumer products that are getting more expensive. </p><p>   U.S. diaper prices are up 9% from a year ago, according to market-research firm IRI, with Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co., the two biggest diaper manufacturers, warning of further increases. </p><p>   \"I'm not happy that the supply is so tight right now,\" said Mike Hsu, chief executive of Huggies maker Kimberly-Clark. </p><p>   Mr. Hsu said there is no diaper shortage and he doesn't expect one, though he said the company has been forced to more carefully manage allocations to retailers. </p><p>   \"We're trying to be as productive as possible and also do everything we can to manage the supply equitably,\" he said. </p><p>   A year ago, acrylic acid was in overabundance and prices were stagnant. </p><p>   That equation began to change last year when Covid-19-related supply-chain disruptions from port delays to a shortage in shipping containers slowed delivery times and increased transportation costs. </p><p>   Then the Texas storm hit, cutting out power to a swath of the state and shutting down the world's largest petrochemical operations, where most U.S.-made acrylic acid is produced. </p><p>   Many storm-battered chemical plants resumed production, but the process of getting back online took weeks, and they remain stymied by problems with pipes and equipment damaged by the storm. A number of suppliers enacted force majeure, also known as the \"act of God\" clause, which is meant to protect businesses when an event outside their control prevents them from meeting their contractual obligations. </p><p>   Supply of acrylic acid is improving, but it could take months to replenish, several suppliers said. </p><p>   Diapers are the biggest user of the superabsorbents, which are also used in adult underwear, feminine-care products, dog-training pads and industrial cleaners. </p><p>   Two of the biggest suppliers to P&amp;G and Kimberly-Clark, BASF SE and Evonik Industries AG, are closely tied to Texas. Evonik's superabsorbent plant is in Louisiana but relies on Texas-based suppliers. Vertically integrated BASF has its superabsorbent operations in Texas. </p><p>   Kimberly-Clark said in March that it would raise prices on several products, including diapers, due to rising materials costs. Procter &amp; Gamble said it is increasing prices in diapers, adult incontinence and feminine care products, all of which rely on acrylic acid. </p><p></p>",
