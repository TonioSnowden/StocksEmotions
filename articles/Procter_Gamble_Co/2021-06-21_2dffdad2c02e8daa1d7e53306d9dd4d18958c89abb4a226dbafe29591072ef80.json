  "text": "<p>In the unduly bellicose jargon of the “war for talent”, staff turnover is sometimes described, all too appropriately, as “attrition”.</p> <p>The term covers a lot of the workplace's most emotional moments: angry resignations, well-deserved retirements, career-ending disabilities, sudden deaths, old-fashioned sackings and their weaselly modern equivalents, from down-sizings to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8684cabc-ac41-11e2-a063-00144feabdc0\">“demisings”</a>. </p> <p>Influencing who stays, and for how long, and who goes, but also how they leave, is a critical and unending task.</p> <p>Take these recent tales of two strategies, at PwC and Amazon.</p> <p>Based on the categories <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/news/2008/10/06/theories-x-and-y\">popularised by the late Douglas McGregor</a>, professional services firms practise Theory Y attrition management, cajoling self-motivated staff towards mutually beneficial goals, inside and even beyond the firm. Amazon models the more utilitarian Theory X, careless of its workers' loyalty, let alone their career after Amazon.</p> <p>PwC has just <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b79e4cd4-e288-4083-a976-47f3e89a0209\">outlined plans</a> to add 100,000 to its 284,000-strong global workforce in the next five years. That would be bold enough, even if the firm did not also have to offset the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dbd794f6-990d-11e6-8f9b-70e3cabccfae\">high attrition rate</a> of Big Four accountants.</p> <p>The plan is not without risk. PwC wants to satisfy a voracious appetite for advice on environmental, social and governance matters (ESG). But “for the profitability [of the firm] to make sense, you need the right number of people at each level for the kind of work that they're selling”, says Laura Empson, academic and author of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba0c9234-a2d7-11e7-9e4f-7f5e6a7c98a2\"><em>Leading Professionals</em></a>. Firms are sometimes left with a “stodgy bloc” of staff who were hired in good times for a specific need but then fail to progress or move on after the market turns.</p> <p>The Big Four manage attrition by sucking in young recruits, training them intensively, and managing their performance closely, while selling their services at a premium to clients. In exchange, these juniors receive the imprimatur of an international brand they can parlay into better paid jobs elsewhere. The big firms like to see themselves as leadership development machines in the same way Procter &amp; Gamble and Unilever feed ambitious young ex-trainees into industry.</p> <p>Strategy consultancies such as McKinsey have further refined this model with an “up or out” system that nudges out staff who will not progress, then cultivates them as alumni. </p> <p>Amazon's expansion plans, supercharged by the need to respond to last year's exceptional jolt in demand for its services, are even more ambitious than PwC's.</p> <p>It has been hiring one person for every six or seven that apply for jobs in warehouses, according to one former Amazon data scientist quoted in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/15/us/amazon-workers.html\">recent New York Times investigation</a>. Its attrition rate is similarly mind-boggling. The group was apparently turning over the equivalent of&#xa0;its entire workforce at least annually before the pandemic. At that rate, this former employee reckons, Amazon would need between 8m and 10m people to apply each year, just to hire enough to keep its staff numbers steady. (Amazon has said focusing on attrition alone omits “important context”. It declined to comment further.)</p> <p>In his book <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01736933-ba2e-47b3-9d99-555112ec2d57\"><em>Amazon Unbound</em></a>, Brad Stone reports that founder Jeff Bezos once told David Niekerk, a senior human resources executive, “if we ever appear in the ‘100 best places to work in America', you've screwed this place up”. Niekerk told the Times that Bezos deliberately limited the upward progress of warehouse workers because entrenching them would lead to “a march to mediocrity”.</p> <p>The short-sightedness of that policy will be obvious if local shortages of labour make it hard for Amazon to hire enough staff. One option for Bezos is to edge towards a PwC-style Theory Y model, because improved staff loyalty and self-motivation should reduce the risk of uncontrolled attrition. Indeed, Bezos recently committed Amazon to become <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/update-on-our-vision-to-be-earths-best-employer-and-earths-safest-place-to-work\">“Earth's best employer”</a>. He will soon be able to assess its progress towards that goal <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/defbe912-ceb9-4017-a215-16d214484597\">from space</a>. </p> <p>The loyalty factor can be overstated. Amazon-style hourly work suits some people. Most white-collar workers aren't looking to work for one employer for decades. Both PwC and Amazon need many willing hands to build the foundations of their strategies. Both face similar dilemmas about how to retain the workers they need and shed those they don't. </p> <p>Critically, both operate in a volatile labour market. US Bureau of Labor Statistics show the number of “quits” or voluntary departures from jobs shrank sharply in March and April last year, as people clung to paid work during the crisis, but had returned to pre-Covid levels by the end of 2020. One <a href=\"https://futureforum.com/2021/06/15/future-forum-pulse/\">recent poll</a> suggests more than a fifth of knowledge workers are likely or very likely to look for jobs elsewhere in the next 12 months. Amazon warehouses may not be their first choice, but given the ecommerce group's expansion and attrition management, there will always be a vacancy.</p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:andrew.hill@ft.com\">andrew.hill@ft.com</a></p> <p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andrewtghill?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@andrewtghill</a></p><p>Source: Andrew Hill 2021 'Amazon and PwC take to the trenches in the talent wars' FT.com 21 June.
