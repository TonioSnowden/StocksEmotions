  "title": "Robert L. James Extended McCann's Global Reach; Ad agency CEO, who has died at age 84, raced sailboats and established a prize for scientists",
  "text": "<p>One of Mr. James's secrets in managing distant outposts was his ability to cope with jet lag. He could fall asleep almost instantly on airplanes and, after landing, charge into a day of work without taking a nap.</p><p>Although he was a CEO, he worked for Philip H. Geier Jr., one of his former Colgate University fraternity brothers, who was chief executive of McCann's parent, Interpublic Group.</p><p>Mr. James, who died at the age of 84 of pancreatic cancer Aug. 29 at his home in Greenwich, Conn., aimed high. When he hosted a gathering of McCann executives from around the world in 1987, the guest speaker was the former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. President Ronald Reagan, whose older brother Neil had been a McCann executive, provided a videotaped greeting, in which he praised Mr. James's leadership skills.</p><p>Mr. James instructed executives attending that meeting in Key Largo, Fla., to \"have a determined and awesome intensity of pursuit\" in carrying out his growth agenda. A good leader, he said, \"confronts nasty problems\" and has \"infectious optimism.\"</p><p>McCann's image took a hit in 1993, when one of the agency's top clients, Coca-Cola Co., transferred much of its creative advertising work to Creative Artists Agency, some of whose ads for the soft drink company starred polar bears. The Coke setback fueled suggestions that McCann was too big and bureaucratic to be at the cutting edge of creative work.</p><p>But McCann survived the psychological blow, and Mr. James said he felt \"a great sense of accomplishment\" when he retired at age 57. His early exit allowed him to spend more time racing sailboats and serving on boards, including those of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.</p><p>He competed in eight sailing races from Newport, R.I., to Bermuda and one trans-Atlantic race. His office at McCann featured photographs of sailing and other nautical décor, including a model of a Dutch tugboat. He served as commodore of the New York Yacht Club in the late 1990s. The intensity needed for sailing, he said, gave him respite from business pressures.</p><p>He donated $2 million to the National Academy of Sciences to establish the James Prize in Science and Technology Integration, recognizing researchers for work drawing on information or techniques from outside their own fields. \"Adapting ideas from other areas can inspire creative ways to solve problems, better, quicker and cheaper,\" Mr. James said when the prize was announced earlier this year.</p><p>Robert Leo James was born Sept. 23, 1936, and grew up in New York. His mother worked for an agricultural publication. His father had a job at a trans-Atlantic shipping company.</p><p>As a boy, Robert used old bottle crates to build a rack for baseball bats and transformed a dresser drawer into a desk. A 1949 article in Pathfinder magazine said he had managed to create \"sturdy custom-made furniture\" from a \"pile of junk.\"</p><p>He skipped grades in primary school and later attended Fordham Preparatory School in the Bronx before enrolling at Colgate University, where he studied literature and graduated in 1958. He earned an M.B.A. degree at Columbia University in 1961.</p><p>After working at Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Colgate-Palmolive Co., Mr. James moved into advertising by joining Ogilvy &amp; Mather, where he met Anne Krapp, who had an entry-level job there. They married in 1968. The same year he jumped to another ad agency, Marschalk Co., where he became chief executive in 1975. By 1980, he was vice chairman of Marschalk's parent company, Interpublic Group, and a year later he joined McCann as vice chairman, responsible for U.S. operations.</p><p>At the time, McCann was recovering from the loss of the Miller beer account, which had accounted for the bulk of profits at the agency's New York office. The agency regained momentum by winning new business from clients including Nestlé S.A., Gillette, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Unilever. Mr. James became president of world-wide operations in 1983 and CEO two years later.</p><p>\"It may be self-serving, but I think globalization is going to accelerate and we're going to benefit from it,\" he told the New York Times in 1984. \"The game is coming to our arena.\"</p><p>He frequently wore a necktie decorated with flags from countries where the agency had offices. He had overseen moves into countries including Cambodia, Hungary and what was then Yugoslavia. The agency, now known simply as McCann, says it currently has offices in 120 countries.</p><p>Mr. James is survived by his wife of 53 years, Anne James, three children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.</p><p>Among the many nautical souvenirs he kept in his office was a framed page from the New York Times showing a chart of the 1987 stock market crash. Mr. James said he kept it by his desk as a reminder that \"it can all be gone like that.\"</p><p>Write to James R. Hagerty at bob.hagerty@wsj.com</p><p>Robert L.
