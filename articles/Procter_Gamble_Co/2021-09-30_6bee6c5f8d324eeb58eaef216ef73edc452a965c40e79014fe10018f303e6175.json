  "text": "<p><br>All things are transitory, reckoned Goethe. The question for businesses and their investors is quite how long they will have to deal with shortages of everything from petrol and peas to truck drivers.</p> <p>Narrow problems of supply are bad enough to trigger a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4904701-61bf-46c6-b6a6-311ce895767a\">warning</a> from Boohoo on Thursday. It matters little to the fast-fashion chain that bond markets have already <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f5ec250-b8f4-4346-b400-f83e0fb4fa4c\">delivered their vote</a> on inflation in its broad incarnation, suggesting it will take longer to materialise than first thought. </p> <p>Elevated freight costs, 16 per cent of revenues in normal times, will continue until the end of February, the fashion retailer said. That echoes the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8db1f8bc-ce26-41bf-9ee0-5382b3741ecc\">gloomy expectations</a> of Fever Tree, a British purveyor of tonic waters, which said logistics costs narrowed interim ebitda margins and higher raw material prices would continue into next year. For Boohoo, heightened transport costs took a £23m — 2.4 per cent of revenues — bite out of first-half numbers. </p> <p>UK businesses are not suffering alone. Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer goods giant, notched up an additional $600m from higher commodity and freight prices while European peer Unilever took a 100 basis point <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d246d96-3d10-4e97-991a-1fe254944396\">hit</a> to operating margins in the six months to June.</p> <p>Manufacturers of consumer goods have more latitude to recoup costs by passing them on to customers. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a55b6132-94fa-43d9-9109-c7de5baa8396\">cut-throat world</a> of fast fashion is less forgiving. Nor can retailers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a19cfb34-51f3-4236-adbb-921a497ef54c\">shrink</a> a frock so easily as a Mars bar. </p> <p>Other trends compound the pummelling to margins. Boohoo touts its massive increase in customers, swollen by brand acquisitions. But the average basket size and spend per order are lower than a year ago, meaning more freight per £1 spent. Returns, free in the UK, have increased and now run at 27-29 per cent.</p> <p>Spooked investors sent shares down 9 per cent. But Boohoo is no outlier. Elevated freight costs, like other inflationary trends, are not that fleeting. The fact that UK prime minister Boris Johnson is issuing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8335166f-9019-471b-9cbf-d7554c3b40b2\">temporary visas</a> for lorry drivers and food industry workers, suggests logistics snags may prove persistent. Unfortunately, retail customers do not have the patience of long-dead German philosopher poets.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Boohoo: logistics freighted with sorrows for young retailer' FT.com 30 September.
