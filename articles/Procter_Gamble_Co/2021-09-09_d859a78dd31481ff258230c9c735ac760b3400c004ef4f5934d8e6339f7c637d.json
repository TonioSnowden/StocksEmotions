  "text": "<p>Any sober seller might think twice about doing business with a company whose founder was wedded to the idea that <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/01/13/margin/\">“your margin is my opportunity.”</a> But many merchants, desperate to stay afloat as retail sales shifted online during the pandemic, have had little choice but to sell on Amazon's vast marketplace. At last count, <a href=\"https://ir.aboutamazon.com/news-release/news-release-details/2021/Amazon.com-Announces-Second-Quarter-Results-2dcdc6a32/\">some 56 per cent of the units sold</a> on Amazon's platform were made by 1.9m third-party sellers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/defbe912-ceb9-4017-a215-16d214484597\">Jeff Bezos may have blasted out of the chief executive's seat</a> at Amazon after 27 years in charge but the company he founded is still dedicated to the relentless pursuit of opportunities in others' profits. </p> <p>As described in a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/05/dont-let-platforms-commoditize-your-business\">recent article in Harvard Business Review</a> by two business academics, Andrei Hagiu and Julian Wright, Amazon has many ways of squeezing margins out of merchants. The ecommerce company entices as many sellers as possible on to its platform to sharpen price competition. It can modify its listing fees or tweak its recommendation algorithms in unknowable ways to promote or demote sellers. It can spot emerging trends in its sales data and launch rival own-brand products.&#xa0;</p> <p>All this makes selling on Amazon akin to tiptoeing into a dragon's cave. You may be able to keep warm but you run the risk of incineration. Yet in spite of the well-advertised dangers, billions of dollars have been pouring into specialist investment funds to snap up some of the platform's most popular small merchants. <a href=\"https://www.marketplacepulse.com/acquirers\">Market Pulse</a>, which tracks the market, calculates that 74 such roll-up funds have raised almost $9bn since April 2020, including Thrasio, Berlin Brands Group and Perch. A trend that started in the US <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/amazon-aggregators-fundraise/\">has now spread to Europe</a>. Such has been the demand that one fund has even been offering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46c63ccd-ef9f-4b9e-9d14-874873c80fb2\">a free Tesla for every successful merchant referral</a>. Why are investors keen to swallow such glaring risks?</p> <p>The sketchy answer tells us much about the rapidly evolving dynamics of online marketplaces as well as the desperation of footloose investors to dance in the digital economy. Some adaptable merchants have thrived in Amazon's marketplace thanks to its immense reach and logistics infrastructure. The most-cited example is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a9cc7e0-e406-477c-bc15-28d6d250c29b\">Anker, the “Amazon-native” Chinese computer accessory manufacturer</a>, that listed in Shenzhen last year with an $8bn valuation. </p> <p>If Amazon is in the business of profitably intermediating data flows then others can acquire useful data intelligence from its site, too. Savvy aggregator funds can snap up the best-selling small merchants and deepen their insights into Amazon's algorithms. The Boston-based Thrasio, which has raised $1.8bn of funding, now owns 150 brands and a portfolio of 22,000 products. Its ambition is to become a consumer goods heavyweight, a new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a9cc7e0-e406-477c-bc15-28d6d250c29b\">Procter &amp; Gamble designed for the digital age</a>.</p> <p>As a former independent seller himself, Jim Mann, Thrasio's director of acquisitions, is familiar with the risks of operating on Amazon's platform: “You are building your house on someone else's real estate. But you cannot ignore the fact that most business has moved on to their real estate.” That said, Thrasio argues it can still make money by boosting the sales and fattening the margins of the merchants it acquires by injecting capital, platform knowhow, marketing muscle and supply chain expertise. </p> <p>By helping to “industrialise” Amazon's fragmented merchant base and providing high-quality and reliable listings and services, Thrasio says it is delivering what Amazon wants, making it a valuable partner. But Mann rejects the idea that any aggregators are yet big enough to change the power dynamics on Amazon's marketplace. “We are little blemishes on the sun.”</p> <p>As well as bulking up, merchants can devise other ways to reduce their vulnerability. One way, outlined in the HBR article, is for merchants to use Amazon as a shop window while building their own direct-to-consumer business through services, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a876506-bb2d-4abd-9496-860820079d39\">such as Shopify,</a> which provides digital tools and infrastructure to more than 1m businesses. As Tobi Lütke, Shopify's chief executive says: “Amazon is trying to build an empire. Shopify is trying to arm the rebels.” A more political route is to lobby increasingly activist regulators to help keep Amazon honest.</p> <p>Many Amazon merchants might still conclude it is a great time to sell out to exuberant, cash-rich aggregator funds. For investors in some of those funds, however, the story could have a less happy ending. The smartest may make a good return by de-risking muscled-up merchants. But in so doing they will only further strengthen Amazon's market dominance.</p> <p><em>john.thornhill@ft.com</em><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p>Source: John Thornhill 2021 'Amazon aggregators are walking into the dragon's cave' FT.com 9 September.
