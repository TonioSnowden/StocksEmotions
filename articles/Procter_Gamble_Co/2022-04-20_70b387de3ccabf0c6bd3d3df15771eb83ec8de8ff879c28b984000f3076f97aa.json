  "title": "Procter & Gamble Posts Biggest Sales Gain in Decades—and a Word of Caution; Company says shoppers still pay up for pricer products like fragrance-free diapers, but executives are bracing for more resistance",
  "text": "<p>Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s booming quarter came with a warning.</p><p>The maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors on Wednesday posted its biggest quarterly sales gain in at least two decades as consumers, so far undeterred by inflation and the threat of a recession, paid more for household mainstays and gravitated toward higher-end options.</p><p>Executives also said they are girding for a possible downturn in consumer spending, betting that shoppers will eventually balk at ever-higher prices on household staples as inflation soars.</p><p>The Cincinnati consumer-products company said organic sales rose 10% for the quarter ended March 31, the biggest jump since P&amp;G started tracking the metric 20 years ago. Organic sales is a closely watched figure that strips out deals and currency moves.</p><p>P&amp;G's priciest offerings were in highest demand, the company said, continuing a trend that has persisted throughout the pandemic. Rather than switching to discount alternatives, consumers on average switched to even-pricier products, from fragrance-free diapers to high-end razors, P&amp;G finance chief Andre Schulten said in an interview.</p><p>P&amp;G executives say the dynamic could shift in coming quarters as U.S. inflation, which hit a 40-year high in March, sets in and consumers grapple with skyrocketing energy and food costs. The war in Ukraine and Covid lockdowns in China are adding further volatility, they said.</p><p>\"We don't assume that what we're seeing to date is necessarily an indication of what will happen in the future,\" Mr. Schulten said. \"We are very well aware that consumers might end up looking at budget constraints.\"</p><p>P&amp;G executives say the company is prepared for consumers' belt-tightening. Should a recession hit and consumers cut spending on staples, P&amp;G would face its first test of operating in an economic downturn since the company's sales growth dropped to anemic levels in 2009 amid the financial crisis. The company didn't recover for a decade.</p><p>In the years since, P&amp;G has unloaded businesses, including most of its beauty brands, that tend to dip in tough financial times. The company's overhauled beauty unit, once populated by dozens of cosmetics, fragrance and salon brands, now largely consists of skin-care, hair-care and other personal-care products.</p><p>Executives on Wednesday said the company plans continued cost cutting and will use a chunk of savings to invest in product improvements that they say will justify higher prices in the minds of consumers.</p><p>Already the company has invested in lower-price alternatives to its costliest brands. Mr. Schulten gave diapers as an example. P&amp;G's priciest offering is a Pampers line that costs 40 cents a diaper. But it also has options that cost 35 cents, 30 cents or 20 cents a diaper.</p><p>Meanwhile, P&amp;G's brands have expanded into dollar and club stores that draw deal-seekers and have begun to focus marketing on the savings potential in more-expensive products.</p><p>For instance, P&amp;G for years has offered laundry detergent that can be effective in cold-wash cycles. Recently, it has begun to promote the product more heavily, making the case that savings from using cold water outweigh the added expense of the detergent. The company launched new packaging for Dawn dish soap that allows consumers to get out every drop of soap, eliminating waste.</p><p>\"All of those leave us in a better position than we've ever been to deal with the potential consumer that is more budget constrained,\" Mr. Schulten said.</p><p>Analysts and industry executives have said they are seeing early signs of a spending slowdown.</p><p>U.S. consumers broadly are buying staples in smaller quantities, switching to cheaper, store-name brands and more rigorously hunting for deals, according to retailers and analysts. The shift is especially pronounced among lower-income consumers who splurged on household products during the height of the pandemic.</p><p>\"Consumers are starting to notice and become more price sensitive in a lot of categories,\" said Randy Burt, a managing director in the consumer-products practice at AlixPartners.</p><p>Consumer cost-cutting hasn't reached P&amp;G.</p><p>In the latest quarter, the company's healthcare segment, which houses brands such as Crest toothpaste and Vicks cold medicine, saw organic sales rise 16% as the company raised prices, consumers switched to premium products and a more severe cough, cold and flu season drove up demand for over-the-counter medications. The two divisions that make home-care and laundry products and baby and feminine-care products each notched 10% gains.</p><p>Pricing overall rose 5%, while sales volumes increased 3%. The only drag was foreign exchange, which lowered revenue by 3%.</p><p>Profit increased as well, albeit more modestly than sales, as P&amp;G absorbed higher costs for materials and transportation and spent more on new products and packaging. P&amp;G reported earnings per share of $1.33, up 6% from the same period a year earlier, while revenue climbed 7% to $19.4 billion.</p><p>The war in Ukraine nicked P&amp;G's profit, shaving 1 cent off quarterly earnings a share as the company halted marketing and limited brands available in Russia. Mr. Schulten said P&amp;G expects the conflict will take off an additional 4 cents a share in the current quarter.</p><p>P&amp;G on Wednesday raised its organic-sales growth forecast to a range of 6% to 7%, up from its earlier forecast of 4%-to-5% growth for the fiscal year ending June 30. It predicted core earnings per share will rise about 3%, the low end of its forecast of 3%-to-6% growth.</p><p>Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble Posts Biggest Sales Gain in Decades—and a Word of Caution</p>",
