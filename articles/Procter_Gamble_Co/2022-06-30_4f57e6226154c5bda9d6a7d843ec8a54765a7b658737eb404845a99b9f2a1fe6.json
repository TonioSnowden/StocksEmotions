  "title": "Black-Owned Media Venture Eyes Big Acquisitions, Including Bustle Parent; Group Black is in talks to buy stake in Bustle parent and has been eyeing a deal for Vice Media",
  "text": "<p>Describing itself as a media collective and accelerator, Group Black was created at a time when the ad industry started facing calls to spend more money advertising on minority-owned outlets. One of its primary goals is to increase the amount of Black-owned media, including by acquiring existing high-profile media brands and adding more multicultural voices and influence, Mr. Montaque said.</p><p>Group Black helps advertisers buy ads with its member companies, which includes outfits such as Essence Communications Inc., the publisher of Essence magazine, which Mr. Dennis bought from Time Inc. in 2018; Holler Technologies Inc., which specializes in stickers and GIFs for digital messages and posts, which Mr. Montaque founded; esports startup PlayVS; and entertainment news sites Shade Room LLC and Baller Alert Inc. The collective has grown to about 200 companies, according to a spokeswoman.</p><p>Group Black said it didn't own the member companies, but works with them on matters like ad commitments.</p><p>The company has attracted about $500 million in ad-spending commitments from companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble Co., as well as ad holding companies WPP, Dentsu and Interpublic Group of Cos, according to a spokeswoman.</p><p>Group Black's talks with BDG are preliminary and could fall apart, people familiar with the discussions said. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Lazard Ltd. are advising Group Black on both M&amp;A and fundraising initiatives, said Mr. Montaque, the company's CEO and co-founder. He declined to comment on whether the company had already secured funding for potential media deals.</p><p>Closely held BDG, which beyond Bustle owns publications such as W and Gawker, was valued at more than $300 million in 2019, according to research firm PitchBook Data. The company generated about $140 million in revenue in 2021, a person familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Both BDG and Vice Media had expressed plans last year to go publicthrough mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, but the SPAC market has since cooled off. Digital-media peer BuzzFeed Inc., which went public in a SPAC deal in December, since has lost about 85% of its market value.</p><p>Vice Media, the media company that once was valued at $5.7 billion and attracted investment and partnerships with media companies ranging from Walt Disney Co. to HBO, has been on the block in recent months, according to documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The Information reported in April that Vicehad hired financial advisers to explore the sale of its studio business. CNBC later reported that Vice was looking to sell itself either whole or in parts.</p><p>Demand has been soaring from Madison Avenue for advertising inventory on Black-owned media outlets. The police killing of George Floyd in 2020 renewed calls for U.S. corporations to do more to address racial inequality, and many companies have begun shifting more ad dollars to minority-owned media, according to ad buyers.</p><p>In May 2021, GroupM, one of the world's largest ad firms, called on its clients to spend at least 2% of their ad budgets on diverse-owned media. GroupM said about 20 of its clients, including L'Oréal SA, Target Corp. and Uber Technologies Inc., had said they would make such a commitment.</p><p>McDonald's Corp.—which is being sued by Black media mogul Byron Allen, who is accusing the fast-food giant of discriminating against Black-owned media companies—said last year that its spending with Black-owned media would rise to 5% of its national advertising budget by 2024 from the 2% it said it spent at the time.</p><p>\"Black-owned media is so underfunded today,\" said Mr. Montaque. \"We believe that it's good for the world if we have diverse voices telling stories we see every day,\" he said.</p><p>\"What we're seeing from a business perspective is the world is reacting strongly to it.\"</p><p>When Group Black was founded last year, Mr. Dennis said the company sought to break the walls of exclusion in the media industry. Mr. Dennis fled violence in his native Liberia in the 1980s and went on to found the beauty brand SheaMoisture and its parent company Sundial Brands that he sold to Unilever PLC in 2017.</p><p>Together, Messrs. Dennis, Montaque, and Bough—a marketing executive and author—own a majority of the company. Group Black's investors also include publishing company Ziff Davis, which invested $15 million in the company in April as part of a larger content partnership, and H/L Ventures, the New York-based venture-capital firm.</p><p>Write to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com, Keach Hagey at keach.hagey@wsj.com and Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com</p><p>Black-Owned Media Venture Eyes Big Acquisitions, Including Bustle Parent</p>",
