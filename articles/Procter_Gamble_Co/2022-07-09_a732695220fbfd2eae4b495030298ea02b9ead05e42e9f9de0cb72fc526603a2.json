  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Personal Board of Directors: Amy Chang --- Director, Walt Disney Co., Procter & Gamble Co.",
  "text": "<p>Within months Ms. Chang found herself in the middle of what was then the most expensive proxy fight in U.S. history. Now, as a member of Walt Disney Co.'s board, she is once again part of another corporate drama as the entertainment giant grapples with a declining share price and a dust-up in Florida over legislation that curbs the discussion of gender identity in early school grades.</p><p>Ms. Chang, 45 years old, has spent much of her life taking on such challenges.</p><p>She attended Stanford University knowing she had only enough money to get through spring quarter of freshman year and got a scholarship from Intel Corp. She worked for McKinsey &amp; Co., eBay Inc. and Google before co-founding a company -- Accompany Inc. -- that she eventually sold to Cisco Systems Inc.</p><p>She serves as a director for five companies, including card-issuing platform Marqeta Inc.</p><p>\"It's a great place to help facilitate more diversity and inclusion coming into the company,\" she said.</p><p>Here are four people she turns to for guidance:</p><p>Lorrie Norrington</p><p>Operating partner, Lead Edge Capital</p><p>Ms. Chang and Ms. Norrington first met more than a decade ago in the women's bathroom at a Stanford University event for directors; they later sat next to each other during lunch. Ms. Norrington has since become a close friend and key adviser on management decisions, moral dilemmas and complicated social issues. \"A lot of times she will have solutions or she will just have more perspective because she's been working a little bit longer,\" Ms. Chang said, \"so she just has even more data and even better pattern matching.\"</p><p>Robin Washington</p><p>Alphabet Inc. board member</p><p>Years ago Ms. Washington and Ms. Chang connected over shared experiences and similar challenges. \"We are both women of color, each of us in worlds where that's less common than it should be, especially in leadership,\" Ms. Chang said. Among the challenges they discussed was how to respond to questions that might be the result of unconscious bias -- \"and find my way when something happens,\" Ms. Chang said, while figuring out how to make it productive. Ms. Chang said she also admires Ms. Washington's curiosity and desire to be the best leader she can be.</p><p>Frank Blake</p><p>Former chairman and CEO, Home Depot</p><p>During Ms. Chang's first board dinner as a P&amp;G director, she was seated next to Mr. Blake. He turned to her and asked: \"What's your favorite podcast these days?\" They quickly connected. Mr. Blake has since encouraged Ms. Chang to ask hard questions in a way that won't put others on the defensive, teaching her to look at a situation from another person's point of view. \"Start with what's important to them and how they see the world,\" Ms. Chang said. \"Even the language choices you make, make a difference.\" The two now speak for an hour each month.</p><p>Jolie Hunt</p><p>Founder and CEO, Hunt &amp; Gather</p><p>Ms. Hunt, who founded and runs a communications firm, later helped Ms. Chang tell the early story of the company she cofounded, Accompany, and served as an adviser. \"It's a life-or-death skill for a startup founder,\" Ms. Chang said. \"Nobody knows your company -- you're like a nobody with no name -- so how do you tell that story such that people get interested.\" Ms. Chang said she learned to test the firm's story on friends and check their body language, such as when they lean forward or turn their face toward her, to grasp when they're actively listening.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
