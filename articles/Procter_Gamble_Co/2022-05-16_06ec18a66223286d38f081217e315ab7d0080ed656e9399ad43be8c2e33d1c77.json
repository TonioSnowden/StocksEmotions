AMZN, Kroger Co. KR and Best Buy Co Inc. BBY</p><p>Walmart adds fuel to its membership program. Walmart announced late April that it is boosting the gas benefit for Walmart+ members, offering a discount of up to 10 cents per gallon at more than 14,000 stations.</p><p>\"Ninety-one percent of our customers are aware of the increased prices at the pump and nearly half of those told us they are changing behaviors because of them,\" said Chris Cracchiolo, senior vice president of Walmart+, in a statement.</p><p>\"More access to a bigger discount will make a difference for our customers.\"</p><p>While the latest government inflation data showed a decline in gas prices, the discount could become an added benefit to members during the summer driving season.</p><p>Other Walmart+ benefits include free shipping and grocery delivery, and six months of free Spotify Premium.</p><p>Walmart+ shoppers tend to be more frequent shoppers, so boosting membership in the program is important to the retailer.
