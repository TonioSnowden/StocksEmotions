  "title": "Inflation Will Sift the Best Household Brands From the Rest; Consumer staples companies like P&G, Nestlé and Unilever agree that cost pressures are intense but not on what this will do to profit margins",
  "text": "<p>But this year will be tougher. All the big consumer-staples companies have warned that cost pressures will be severe in 2022, but they don't agree on how this will hit profitability. Brewer Heineken and Lysol disinfectant owner Reckitt still expect to grow operating margins this year. Nestlé said its margins could be 0.4 percentage points lower than the 17.4% the business managed in 2021. Big cuts are on the way for others. Unilever's operating margins may be 2.4 percentage points lower this year than last.</p><p>The differences can no longer be fully explained by companies' geographic exposure, hedging policies or the kind of products they sell. Inflation is now impacting most countries and commodities, and hedges that protected some companies last year are coming to an end.</p><p>Unilever's large emerging markets business should actually be an advantage: It can be easier to pass on higher prices in developing countries, where retailers often don't have the corporate muscle to push back, though some consumers trade down to cheaper alternatives. A big portfolio of premium brands can help. Nestlé now makes 35% of group sales from expensive products like San Pellegrino water that are sold to wealthier and less price-conscious consumers.</p><p>Such portfolio differences aside, the health of companies' brands may be starting to show in the quality of their growth. Nestlé and Procter &amp; Gamble still look balanced. P&amp;G's latest sales bump was evenly split between higher prices and selling in greater quantities. Unilever is already completely dependent on higher prices for growth, after its volumes turned flat in the fourth quarter. And volume growth was negative in two of Reckitt's three product categories. Companies with weak volumes are more likely to lose market share when they raise prices, which will be expensive to win back in future.</p><p>After a decade of focus on cost cutting, big consumer companies will find it harder to offset inflation with more efficient factories or distribution networks. Two places where they might find savings are automation and marketing budgets. A shift to digital ad spending could help companies to target customers more precisely for less money.</p><p>Shoppers have swallowed higher prices at the grocery store so far, particularly in the U.S., where disposable incomes got a boost from government stimulus checks. But weakening volumes at some companies suggest this may have run its course. Investors will soon learn which brands consumers can and can't live without.</p><p>Write to Carol Ryan at carol.ryan@wsj.com</p><p>Inflation Will Sift the Best Household Brands From the Rest</p>",
