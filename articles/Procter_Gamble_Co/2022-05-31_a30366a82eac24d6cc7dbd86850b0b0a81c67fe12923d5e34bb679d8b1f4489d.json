  "title": "Before Unilever, Nelson Peltz Took Aim at P&G's 'Thicket'; P&G overhauled its management after investor's proxy fight but didn't follow his advice to de-emphasize big brands, which have fueled strong sales",
  "text": "<p>During Mr. Peltz's tenure on P&amp;G's board, which ended in August 2021, the company overhauled its operations and in turn accelerated sales growth, positioning itself to capitalize on the pandemic and regularly outperform its rivals.</p><p>Now Mr. Peltz is joining the board of the biggest of those competitors, Unilever PLC, maker of Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise.</p><p>Unilever has its own matrix-management woes. Mr. Peltz says the company has \"significant potential.\"</p><p>His entry to P&amp;G was less diplomatic. Mr. Peltz said P&amp;G was mired in the past and that it had settled for mediocrity. He called the company a suffocating bureaucracy. On the sidelines of a shareholder meeting, Mr. Peltz accused then-Chief Executive Officer David Taylor of not listening to him.</p><p>He called for organizing P&amp;G into three units and recruiting executives from outside the company. He also pushed P&amp;G to downsize its ranks and revamp how executives were compensated.</p><p>Mr. Taylor and his lieutenants said at the time that the management overhaul Mr. Peltz called for was already under way.</p><p>Mr. Taylor said some of Mr. Peltz's ideas were wrongheaded, namely his view that the company should move away from big-name brands like Tide and Pampers in favor of niche names with youth appeal.</p><p>The two sides waged a monthslong, public battle before P&amp;G agreed to add Mr. Peltz to the board following a shareholder vote that was so close the result was in dispute.</p><p>Some of Mr. Peltz's initial requests never materialized. P&amp;G didn't reorganize into three units. While the company made a string of smaller acquisitions, P&amp;G remains as focused as ever on its biggest brands, most of which saw surging demand amid the pandemic as consumers gravitated toward trusted names.</p><p>P&amp;G did clear out \"the thicket.\" Gone, too, is an executive-compensation structure that P&amp;G leaders said failed to properly motivate leaders and hold them to account.</p><p>And while the company didn't organize itself into three operating units, it divided into seven operating units, each headed by a leader fully responsible for that unit's financials and profitability.</p><p>P&amp;G CEO Jon Moeller, the former finance chief who succeeded Mr. Taylor in November, has said that Mr. Peltz lent urgency to P&amp;G's restructuring. People familiar with the situation say Mr. Peltz also had a major role in revamping the company's compensation metrics so that leaders are more directly motivated to meet their goals.</p><p>The company unwound the management structure that had executives responsible for key brands and others responsible for geographic areas, a setup that resulted in dozens of managers reporting to multiple leaders. Also gone is the centralized product development that unilaterally controlled which ideas got approved and how they were marketed.</p><p>In April, the Cincinnati-based company posted its strongest quarterly sales gain in decades as customers continued to buy its pricier products despite rising inflation. Its share price is up 86% from when Mr. Peltz joined the board. The S&amp;P 500 rose by about 50% in the same period.</p><p>Before leaving the board, Mr. Peltz backed Mr. Moeller, a rival during the proxy battle, to succeed Mr. Taylor.</p><p>Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com</p><p>Before Unilever, Nelson Peltz Took Aim at P&amp;G's 'Thicket'</p>",
