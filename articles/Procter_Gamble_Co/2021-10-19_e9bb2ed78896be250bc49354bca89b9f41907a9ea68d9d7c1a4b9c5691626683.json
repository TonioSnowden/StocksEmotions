  "text": "<p>Stock markets rose on Tuesday and government debt yields increased as traders balanced optimism about corporate earnings with the prospect of central banks lifting interest rates.</p> <p>Wall Street's S&amp;P 500 index closed 0.7 per cent higher in New York; the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite also ended the day up 0.7 per cent. The Stoxx Europe 600 index closed up 0.3 per cent.</p> <p>The consumer goods bellwether Procter &amp; Gamble warned of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0118f98c-7361-4ea2-b643-93ee9a3389bf\">rising input costs</a> earlier in the day, but maintained its full-year earnings forecast. Shares in P&amp;G ceded 1.2 per cent to $140.66.</p> <p>Signs that companies were managing inflationary pressures would prompt traders to top up on equities, analysts said, especially as bond markets remained vulnerable to central banks' monetary tightening signals. </p> <p>“There is dispersion between central banks about the pace of monetary tightening,” said Salman Baig, multi-asset investment manager at Unigestion. “But markets are pricing in US rate hikes. It makes equities more resilient because there are fewer reasons to be in bonds.” </p> <p>The FTSE All-World share index, which was driven more than 4 per cent lower in September, has recouped almost all of those losses so far this month. </p> <p>In bond markets, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note — which moves inversely to its price — rose to 1.64 per cent, its highest trading level since May. </p> <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest meeting suggested the US central bank might begin reducing its $120bn a month of coronavirus-driven bond purchases as soon as next month. Financial markets are also pricing in the first pandemic-era rate rise from the central bank — which pulled borrowing costs down to zero at the peak of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus\">coronavirus crisis</a> in March 2020 — for September next year. </p> <p>Supply chain bottlenecks and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4581bd5d-0771-44ca-93ac-13c4ed2a66be\">rising cost</a> of energy, food and rents have kept US headline consumer price inflation higher than 5 per cent for four months. But in the minutes of their latest meeting, Fed policymakers continued to describe the surge as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c52493ff-cc51-4e69-b532-acbd0bdee8c4\">“transitory”</a>. </p> <p>Andrew Bailey, Bank of England governor, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/160e6e1a-2584-4013-8102-3ae5cfadb1d8\">taken a different tone</a>, saying over the weekend that the UK central bank would “have to act” on price pressures. The latest UK inflation data will be released on Wednesday. </p> <p>“The BoE is taking a way firmer stance than many other central banks,” said Salman Ahmed, global head of macro at Fidelity International. </p> <p>“Whether that thinking is correct, we don't know, it could be that they kill the [post-pandemic] economic recovery,” he added, if rising debt costs combined with surging commodity prices hit consumer spending. </p> <p>The yield on the UK's 10-year government was last up 0.03 percentage points to 1.16 per cent.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the dollar dropped against leading currencies as traders wagered on central banks outside the US raising interest rates before the Fed moves to increase borrowing costs. </p> <p>The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six peers, fell to its lowest level since late September, but retraced some of those losses by mid-afternoon in New York. It was last down 0.2 per cent.</p> <p>Sterling rose by 0.5 per cent against the dollar to $1.38 as investors placed further bets on the BoE raising rates by Christmas to battle inflation. </p> <p>Ahmed said the dollar would remain “the antidote to fragility” in equity and bond markets as investors remained fearful about inflation causing an economic slowdown. </p> <p>A survey of 430 fund managers by Bank of America found that their cash holdings jumped to a year high of 4.7 per cent of assets in October as participants' global growth expectations turned negative for the first time since April last year. </p><p>Source: Naomi Rovnick in London and Kate Duguid in New York 2021 'Stocks rise as earnings reports temper bets on rate rises' FT.com 19 October.
