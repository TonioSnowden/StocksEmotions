  "text": "<p>Will Zoom meetings survive the end of the pandemic? The company on Monday surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in its history, but demand for its videoconferencing services showed signs of slowing. Small businesses and consumers are starting to spend less as opportunities for in-person meetings and gatherings expand. As offices reopen, analysts are raising questions about Zoom's ability to retain customers and sustain the kind of lift it enjoyed during the pandemic's work-from-home boom. Zoom shares plummeted 17% Tuesday.</p><p>PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE CO.</p><p>PG -0.4%</p><p>Americans are buying up toilet paper again. Procter &amp; Gamble, the biggest U.S. maker of toilet paper and paper towels, said it is ramping up production as demand increases. The company behind Charmin and Bounty is running factories 24 hours a day, seven days a week and investing to increase shipping volumes. While the situation isn't as dire as it was in early 2020 when panicked shoppers cleared shelves of paper towels and toilet paper, for many months sales returned to pre-pandemic levels as Americans worked through their stockpiles. P&amp;G shares fell 0.4% Tuesday.</p><p>UNITED AIRLINES HOLDINGS INC.</p><p>UAL -3.8%</p><p>America's vacation from travel restrictions might get canceled. The European Union recommended halting nonessential travel from the U.S. because of the rise of Covid-19 cases. For Europe's tourist-heavy southern economies, the June decision to place the U.S. on the safe list was a welcome relief. Trade group Airlines for America called the decision a disappointment to the U.S. airline industry. United Airlines shares lost 3.8% Monday.</p><p>ALPHABET INC.</p><p>GOOG -0.1%</p><p>Google is hitting refresh on its return-to-work schedule. The Alphabet unit said on Tuesday it is extending work-from-home protocols until Jan. 10 amid rising Covid-19 infections and hospitalizations. Google will also provide staff with holidays on Oct. 22 and Dec. 17 this year to \"reset and recharge.\" The delay comes a month after Google pushed its office return to October from September because of the infectious Delta variant. Earlier this month, Apple Inc. also delayed its back-to-work plans for staff until at least January. Alphabet shares ended 0.1% lower Tuesday.</p><p>MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL INC.</p><p>MDLZ -0.7%</p><p>Grocers are having a snack attack. Stores worried about a run on Ritz crackers and Oreos are boosting their orders in case the maker of these snacks, Mondelez, has to slow production due to a labor strike. Mondelez workers are opposing changes to work schedules, overtime and healthcare sought by Mondelez in contract negotiations. The strike started Aug. 10 with unionized workers at a Mondelez bakery in Portland, Ore., and has since spread to two other bakeries and three distribution facilities in Colorado, Illinois, Georgia and Virginia. Mondelez shares declined 0.7% Thursday.</p><p>MODERNA INC.</p><p>MRNA +2%</p><p>How low should a dose in a Covid-19 booster shot go? That is the question before the Food and Drug Administration as it weighs a Moderna request to authorize a booster at 50 micrograms, half the dosage given in the first two shots. But The Wall Street Journal reported that some in the government favor the higher dose to assure the strongest protection against Covid-19 variants. People who have seen the data told The Journal both doses produce a strong immune response. One possible benefit of a lower dose is fewer side effects. Moderna shares rose 2% Thursday.</p><p>FORD MOTOR CO.</p><p>F -0.9%</p><p>The auto industry is hitting the brakes on Labor Day weekend car sales due to a shortage of computer chips used in everything from air bags to engines. Dealership lots were stripped of inventory ahead of one of the biggest-selling weekends of the year. The availability of new and used vehicles is down following a semiconductor shortfall that hampered auto production in the spring and summer. Ford and General Motors Co. said they are extending production cuts at several North American factories into September. Ford Motor shares lost 0.9% Friday.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
