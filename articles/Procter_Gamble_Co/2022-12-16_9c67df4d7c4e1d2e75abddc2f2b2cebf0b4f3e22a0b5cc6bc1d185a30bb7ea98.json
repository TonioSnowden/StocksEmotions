  "title": "U.S. News:  Some Cold, Cough Drugs in Short Supply as Infections Rise  ----  By Sharon Terlep and Brianna Abbott",
  "text": "<p>   U.S. households are stepping up spending on cough and cold medicines and children's pain relievers amid a rise in reports of respiratory infections, leading to sporadic shortages of some drugs online and at stores. </p><p>   Flu infections and hospitalizations are surging across the country, federal data suggests, on top of an already busy season for other respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. These viruses are common in the fall and winter months, but the sharp, early increases have roiled families and put pressure on children's hospitals. </p><p>   At the same time, Covid-19 wastewater levels and Covid-related hospitalizations have been on the upswing in recent weeks, data show, though both are slightly lower than they were at this time last year. </p><p>   Sales of cough and cold medications at U.S. retailers rose 35% in the four-week period ended Dec. 3 compared with the year-earlier period, according to a Jefferies analysis of Nielsen data. Spending on throat sprays and lozenges increased 56% in the period. </p><p>   Some versions of top-selling brands, especially pain relief treatments designed for children, are sold out on Amazon.com Inc. and the online sites of CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. Some consumers are taking to social media to report problems finding medications. </p><p>   Spokesmen for CVS and Walgreens said that their companies are working with manufacturers to ensure continued supply of medications. An Amazon spokeswoman said the company is working to get sold-out items back in stock but that a number of cough and cold products are still available for fast delivery. </p><p>   Manufacturers of drugs in high demand on Wednesday said that their plants are running nonstop.A spokesman for Procter &amp; Gamble Co., maker of NyQuil, DayQuil and Vicks, said the country is seeing an \"unprecedented level of respiratory need.\" </p><p>   A spokeswoman for Johnson &amp; Johnson said that while some products may be less readily available, the company isn't experiencing widespread shortages of children's Tylenol or Motrin. </p><p>   The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, which tracks shortages of medications, has gotten reports on shortages of the flu medication Tamiflu because of high demand, said Michael Ganio, ASHP's senior director of pharmacy practice and quality. </p><p>   The early timing of the flu season might be contributing to the emptying of someshelves, Dr. Ganio said, catching manufacturers off guard. \"There's still inventory coming in,\" Dr. Ganio said. \"It's just a matter of being patient, something that is very difficult if you're a parent or a caregiver of a sick child.\" </p><p></p>",
