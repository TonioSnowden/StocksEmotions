  "title": "Walmart Cuts Profit Outlook as It Lowers Prices to Move Goods; Retailer said higher food and fuel prices are denting consumer spending, requiring more markdowns on apparel, other inventory",
  "text": "<p>Walmart Inc. warned that higher prices for food and fuel were causing consumers to pull back, hurting the retail giant's profits for the current quarter and fiscal year.</p><p>The company, which warned in May that it was stuck with too much unsold goods, said it was having to cut prices to reduce merchandise levels at its flagship chain and Sam's Club warehouse chain, which would crimp its profits.</p><p>The announcement sent Walmart's shares down more than 8% in after-hours trading Monday. It opened a week when a raft of global brands and multinational companies—from McDonald's Corp. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. to Visa Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.—are slated to update investors on their latest quarterly results and the outlook for the rest of the year.</p><p>Inflation has been running near the highest levels in decades, and the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates this week as it seeks to fight higher prices. Several high-tech companies have warned in recent days of slowing growth, and leaders of some of the biggest banking companies have cautioned they see a high risk of recession.</p><p>Walmart said higher prices for food and fuel have hurt sales of general merchandise, especially apparel, which generate higher profit margins for the company. Overall, the company expects comparable store sales, excluding fuel, for its Walmart U.S. division to rise 6% in the second quarter from a year ago, but the growth is coming from less profitable items. The company is slated to give its full second-quarter report Aug. 16.</p><p>While U.S. unemployment remains near its lowest levels in decades, consumer sentiment fell in June to its lowest point on record, a sign of concern because household spending accounts for about 70% of U.S. economic output. Some shoppers, especially from lower-income households, are trading down to economy beer and discount cigarettes as they feel more pressure on their pocketbooks.</p><p>As the largest U.S. retailer, Walmart is a bellwether for the sector and its reduced profit forecasts highlight the pressures all retailers are under, said Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData.</p><p>Retailers from Gap Inc. and Macy's Inc. to Target Corp. and Walmart have reported surges of inventory as shoppers shifted their spending from items that had been in high demand during the pandemic. The shift left retailers with a glut of peak pandemic favorites—including as casual clothes and home products—that needed to be marked down.</p><p>Walmart in May reported that inventories rose about 33% in the first quarter, in part because it misjudged shifts in consumer spending. Executives said the higher cost of goods because of inflation, as well as an easing of the supply-chain snarls that limited supplies earlier in the pandemic, also contributed to the excess inventory.</p><p>\"The increasing levels of food and fuel inflation are affecting how customers spend,\" Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said in a statement, \"and while we've made good progress clearing hardline categories, apparel in Walmart U.S. is requiring more markdown dollars.\"</p><p>Mr. McMillon said the company expects additional pressure on general merchandise in the rest of the year, including the holiday shopping season, but said school supplies were selling well as families prepare for a new academic year.</p><p>Walmart now expects its operating income, excluding units it has divested, to decline between 10% and 12% for the fiscal year ending in January. In May the company said it expected operating income for the year to decrease about 1%, excluding currency fluctuations, down from a previous estimate of an around 3% increase.</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Walmart Cuts Profit Outlook as It Lowers Prices to Move Goods</p>",
