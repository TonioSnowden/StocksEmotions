  "title": "C-Suite Strategies (A Special Report): Management Top 250  ---    Which Industry Excels at Innovation? You'll Be Surprised:  Consumer-staples companies stand out  ----  By Rick Wartzman and Kelly Tang",
  "text": "<p>   Of all the questions we're asked by corporate executives trying to unpack our data, the one we get most often is, \"How can my company be more innovative -- you know, like those in tech?\" </p><p>   In light of our latest research, what they might want to ask instead is, \"How can my company be more innovative, like those in consumer staples?\" </p><p>   Our findings are derived from a statistical model that was developed by the Drucker Institute and serves as the foundation of the Management Top 250, an annual ranking produced in partnership with The Wall Street Journal. Anchored in the ideas and ideals of the late management scholar Peter Drucker, it gauges a company's \"effectiveness\" -- defined, to use Mr. Drucker words, as \"doing the right things well.\" The 2020 list was published in December. </p><p>   In all, we examined 886 large, publicly traded companies last year through the lens of 33 indicators that fall into five categories: customer satisfaction, employee engagement and development, innovation, social responsibility and financial strength. </p><p>   To construct our ranking, corporations are compared in each of the five areas, as well as in their overall effectiveness, through standardized scores with a typical range of 0 to 100 and a mean of 50. </p><p>   Innovation is sized up a bit differently than the others, however. In this category, we evaluate every company's performance relative to the average of its industry peers. This is to ensure that we aren't comparing the total patents filed or high-tech job postings made by, say, a software firm and a hotel chain. </p><p>   Still, we've long wondered: What would happen if we took off this industry-specific lens and looked at innovation scores in nonrelative terms? And so, for our most recent analysis, we did just that. </p><p>   The results were striking. Out of 11 industry sectors, the one with the largest concentration of highly innovative companies -- that is, those scoring 60 or above on our 0-100 scale, putting them squarely in the upper quintile of the entire universe -- was consumer staples, with 12.1% of the firms hitting that threshold. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Altria Group Inc., Philip Morris International Inc., Colgate-Palmolive Co., PepsiCo Inc., Coca-Cola Co. and Walmart Inc. all made the grade. </p><p>   Next was information technology at 8.5%, followed by communication services at 4.5% and healthcare at 4.3%. </p><p>   The seven standouts from consumer staples (out of 58 companies in the sector) excelled at a handful of things in particular -- and it is here where some broader lessons may lie. </p><p>   One such measure, supplied by wRatings, tracks customer perceptions of how innovative a company is according to seven attributes: usefulness, quality, simplicity, coolness, uniqueness, variety and competence. </p><p>   In his consulting practice, says Gary Williams, founder and CEO of wRatings, he has seen major players in consumer staples deftly use data and technology to ferret out evolving customer wants and needs -- and respond by devising new products and ways to deliver them. </p><p>   The most innovative consumer-staples companies also scored extraordinarily high in the quantity and breadth of their trademarks -- a type of intellectual property consisting of a word, phrase, symbol or design that distinguishes a product or service from that offered by others. </p><p>   This makes perfect sense given how companies in this fast-moving sector must be ruthlessly consistent when it comes to maintaining the values of their core brand while, at the same time, striving to stay fresh and relevant. </p><p>   In all of this, the message is clear: If you want your company to be more innovative, you'd be smart to pay as much attention to those that sell corn chips as to those that sell computer chips. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Wartzman is the head of the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society, a part of the Drucker Institute, and Ms. Tang is the institute's senior director of research.
