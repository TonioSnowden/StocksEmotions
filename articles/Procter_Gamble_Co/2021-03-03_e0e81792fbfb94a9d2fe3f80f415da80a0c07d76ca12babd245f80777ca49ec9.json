  "text": "<p>Some 63% of women say they are mainly responsible for chores, compared with 31% of men, according to a Procter &amp; Gamble survey of 1,578 adults in December. P&amp;G also found a perception gap: Despite 31% of men saying they did most of the chores, just 2% of women agreed that their spouse took on most of the work, the company says.</p><p>Some companies are pitching in with products to get family members involved. P&amp;G's Dawn dish soap and Swiffer dusters started a campaign last month urging consumers to \"come clean to close the chore gap.\"</p><p>Dawn Powerwash, which shoots sudsy dish soap from a spray nozzle, was initially developed to accommodate consumers' increasing preference to wash each dish as it gets dirty with a squirt of soap and a rinse. Since launching it about a year ago, P&amp;G says it learned that the novelty of shooting soap especially appealed to men.</p><p>After one experience with Dawn's new spray nozzle, men showed more volunteerism to wash dishes, says John Stickney, director of P&amp;G's dish care research and development. \"Rather than dragging them into the kitchen, we're drawing them to the sink to start helping out with more regularity,\" he says.</p><p>Swiffer mops pick up dirt with a disposable pad, which P&amp;G internally calls the \"scorecard\" because a dirty pad shows how much dirt was picked up after mopping. Cleaning newbies especially enjoy looking at them, says Steve McGowan, senior director of P&amp;G's surface care research and development.</p><p>\"They get that instant feedback,\" he says. \"It reinforces that they can do this job.\"</p><p>One chore is done mostly by men: yardwork. To draw in new users, especially women, outdoor-equipment maker Briggs &amp; Stratton has introduced lighter-weight mowers, chain saws and trimmers, and quieter engines, the company says.</p><p>Men and women equally share the purchase decision of outdoor equipment, but actually using it still falls to about 75% men and 25% women, according to Briggs &amp; Stratton research. Christin Wam, the company's director of marketing for turf and consumer products, says the disparity could be due to the initial intention of sharing yardwork equally, but that women's many other household demands get in the way.</p><p>\"I wonder if the thought is that they could get out there and do it, but then based on their workloads maybe they don't,\" she says.</p><p>Last March -- 14 days after Rebekah Ratliff had her third baby -- the pandemic shut down her 2-year-old's daycare and her 6-year-old's school. Her husband, an essential worker, had to work long hours away from home. \"We were accumulating so much laundry, so many more dirty dishes, stuff was everywhere,\" says Ms. Ratliff, 28.</p><p>By the end of April, Ms. Ratliff, who lives in Chesterfield, S.C., developed a strategy involving everyone but the baby in daily chores. Her now 3-year-old son is responsible for putting toys into a designated basket and hunting down his baby sister's bottles and setting them in the sink. Ms. Ratliff's older son, now 7, makes his bed and is in charge of putting his dirty clothing and his brother's into the laundry room.</p><p>Her husband takes the trash out, takes care of the dog at night, and keeps the family's robotic vacuum and mop programmed for daily use. Ms. Ratliff does the rest, running her clothing business during her younger children's nap times and at night.</p><p>\"None of it feels like a chore now because we just break it up throughout the day,\" says Ms. Ratliff. \"It's not chaotic -- everyone knows their part.\"</p><p>Last month, GE Appliances announced a partnership with S'moresUp, a chore-assigning app. The app connects with GE's smart appliances and can directly create and assign chores to family members and remind them when a task is pending. When a dishwasher cycle completes or the dryer finishes, S'moresUp notifies the assigned person to put away the dishes or fold clothes.</p><p>The app -- named for the treat because it rhymes with \"chores\" -- can grant tokens, which parents can assign a dollar value to when a chore is completed, or a child can work toward a reward, like a toy or a trip to the ice-cream shop.</p><p>When S'moresUp launched in 2017, the app was originally designed for assigning chores to children. But immediately its users -- about 80% are women -- asked that the app enlist partners, too, says S'moresUp co-founder Priya Rajendran.</p><p>\"Apps like [S'moresUp] take the friction out of managing everyone's tasks,\" says Jeremy Miller, commercial director of SmartHome Solutions for GE Appliances. \"Yelling at everyone isn't a good solution to anything, neither is nagging or ad hoc assigning chores -- that can be grinding,\" he says.</p><p>Last April, facing the prospect of scrubbing three bathrooms on her own, Danielle Silk, 44, told her children it was \"bathroom day.\" Her motivation was twofold, she says. \"I wouldn't have to clean all the bathrooms by myself, and I realized 'oh my gosh, how do you two not know how to clean a bathroom?' \" she says.</p><p>Ms. Silk, a teacher in Arnold, Md., walked her daughter, 10-year-old Finley, and son, 12-year-old Charlie, through the steps of cleaning a toilet, sink and mirror. \"Don't even think about touching the paper towels,\" Ms. Silk told them, fearing they would run out. \"I made them use rags.\"</p><p>As Ms. Silk taught her children how to do more chores, new talents emerged. Finley fell in love with spreading mulch, despite her blisters. Charlie developed a passion for cooking breakfast, especially pancakes. No matter that his kitchen concoctions can get messy. \"Sometimes that makes a little more work for me, but it's totally worth it,\" Ms. Silk says.</p>",
