  "title": "C-Suite Strategies (A Special Report)  ---  Which Companies Can Raise Prices?  Certain businesses can increase prices without angering customers. For others, it isn't so easy.  ----  By Rick Wartzman and Kelly Tang",
  "text": "<p>   High inflation has left executives with a tricky choice. </p><p>   Should they pass along their companies' cost increases to their customers, preserving profit margins? Or should they swallow some of their rising expenses, cutting into margins in a bid to hold down prices for consumers and thereby maintain, or possibly even pick up, market share? </p><p>   Our analysis, based on the Drucker Institute's measure of corporate effectiveness, suggests the answer depends at least in part on what industry you're in. </p><p>   Leading companies in certain businesses, like autos, appear to be in a relatively good position to raise prices without eating into customer satisfaction. Others, such as airlines, should be warier about boosting prices; on the whole, they run a higher risk of alienating customers if they do. </p><p>   Our framework, which rests on the core teachings of the late management scholar Peter Drucker, serves as the foundation of the Management Top 250, an annual ranking produced in partnership with The Wall Street Journal. The 2021 list was published in December. </p><p>   In all, we examined 846 large publicly traded corporations last year through the lens of 34 separate indicators in five categories: customer satisfaction, employee engagement and development, innovation, social responsibility and financial strength. </p><p>   To build our ranking, companies are compared in each of the five areas, as well as their overall effectiveness, through standardized scores with a typical range of 0 to 100 and a mean of 50. Mr. Drucker defined effectiveness as \"doing the right things well.\" </p><p>   In our latest research, prompted by concerns over inflation, we explored the correlation between net profit margin -- the percentage of profit a company produces from its total revenue -- and customer satisfaction for 2021. </p><p>   Of the 24 industries we looked at, 11 showed no meaningful statistical relationship between the two. Others, however, stood out. </p><p>   In six industries -- household and personal products, autos, telecommunications, consumer services, banks and pharmaceuticals -- there was a significant positive correlation between profit margin and customer satisfaction. </p><p>   This means the two variables move in the same direction. When one goes up, the other goes up; when one goes down, the other goes down. And it implies that, in general, firms in these industries have a fair bit of leeway to raise prices without making their customers disgruntled. </p><p>   \"We call this pricing power,\" says Philipp Biermann, a senior partner at the consulting firm Simon-Kucher. In these industries, he explains, customers tend to have brand allegiance and are willing to accept higher prices. \"They have something people love,\" Mr. Biermann says. \"They can differentiate.\" </p><p>   Consider Procter &amp; Gamble Co., maker of Pampers diapers, Tide laundry detergent and Crest toothpaste. Though the company says it is prepared for consumers to rein in spending, it has been able to lift prices without suffering widespread defections. </p><p>   Within some industries, our findings indicate that companies probably have more of an ability to bump up prices than might seem obvious. </p><p>   Telecommunications is an interesting example. Michael Vermillion, a senior managing director at J.D. Power, which supplies customer-satisfaction data for our model, says that although a low price can be what influences telecom consumers, companies are increasingly battling it out over the quality of their service. </p><p>   At the other end of the spectrum are companies in industries with a negative correlation between profit margin and customer satisfaction. Across these sectors, when net profit margin goes up, customer satisfaction goes down -- and vice versa. </p><p>   In many of these cases, \"low price itself is one of the factors that drives satisfaction,\" says Dan McKone, a senior partner at L.E.K. Consulting. Food and staples retailers are often in this situation. The transportation industry, which includes the airlines, also has a substantial negative correlation. </p><p>   \"With the bounce back in leisure travel the airlines have been focused more on operations -- staffing and planes -- as they try to keep up and focused less on the passenger experience,\" Mr. Vermillion says. \"As a result, we see very long hold times for customer service, long lines at the airports and generally a more commoditized product. The airlines have raised prices significantly, but the jury is out on whether that can be sustained without a renewed focus on customer satisfaction.\" </p><p>   Of course, our analysis is hardly definitive. Whether a company can push through a price increase can never be determined simply from picking out two metrics at the industry level. Much will hinge on a company's existing market share and how its competitors react. </p><p>   What's more, any company with low customer satisfaction may well have trouble raising prices -- regardless of the industry it's in. \"It's a delicate calibration,\" Mr. McKone says. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Wartzman is the head of the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society, a part of the Drucker Institute, and Ms. Tang is the institute's senior director of research.
