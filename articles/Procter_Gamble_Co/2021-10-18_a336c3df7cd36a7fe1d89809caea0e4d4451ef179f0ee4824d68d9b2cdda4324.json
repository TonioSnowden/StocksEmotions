  "title": "The Dow is on track for its best October in 6 years and third-quarter earnings are strong so far. What could go wrong?",
  "text": "<p>Check out: Sign up for a new MarketWatch newsletter on crypto, Distributed Ledger, launching next month.</p><p>Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA is on track for its best month since March when it rose 6.62%, FactSet data show.</p><p>The rally, in what is typically one of the weakest months of the year, has put blue-chips within 1% of its Aug. 16 record closing high at 35,625.40. And our colleagues at Dow Jones Market Data said that the index's performance so far represents the best start to October since, 2015.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPXis off 1.45% from its record high at 4,536.95 and the Nasdaq Composite COMP is 3.1% of from its Sept. 7 all-time high finish at 15,374.33.</p><p>It is very early days, with only 8% of the S&amp;P 500 index companies reporting third-quarter results thus far, but at least 80% of companies are beating expectations on earnings and revenue, according to John Butters, FactSet's senior earnings analyst.</p><p>Butters says that the blended growth rate (estimates and actual results) of reporting S&amp;P 500 companies is 30%, which would, if it holds, represent the earnings growth rate in over a decade.</p><p>On top of that, the blended net profit margin of 12.3% would mark the third-highest recorded by FactSet since it began tracking that metric in 2008. On June 30, the estimated net profit margin for the third quarter was 12%.</p><p>FactSetIt certainly didn't hurt that JPMorgan Chase JPM, Goldman Sachs GS, Bank of America BAC, Citigroup C, Wells Fargo WFCand Morgan Stanley MS, some of the biggest banks in the country, bested earnings estimates, Butters said.</p><p>To be sure, it isn't as if an all-clear signal has sounded for the bulls, with investors still harboring agita centered on surging inflation, stagflation, the Evergrande-fueled China property saga and an ongoing energy crisis, among other concerns.</p><p>However, the drift higher in U.S. stocks has defied the gravitational pull of those bearish factors. Maybe bulls can thank investor and market prognosticator Dennis Gartman, who after a particularly bad day in October declared the bull market dead.</p><p>https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1445067532176707593That prediction may yet turn out to be true but market analyst and founder of NorthmanTrader.com, Sven Henrich,&#xa0;was't going to miss the opportunity to rib Gartman.</p><p>See:&#xa0;MarketWatch and Barron's also is gathering the most influential figures in crypto to help identify the opportunities and risks that lie ahead in digital assets on Oct. 27 and Nov. 3.&#xa0;Register today.</p><p>https://twitter.com/NorthmanTrader/status/1449389451499773955However, the market is far from out of the woods. The Federal Reserve seems poised to start tapering its monthly purchases of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.</p><p>And MarketWatch's Vivien Lou Chen has written that stronger-than-expected U.S. inflation data for September has bond investors considering the risk that the Federal Reserve may end up being forced to tighten interest rates into a stagnating economy with persistently higher price rises.</p><p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to give a speech at the end of this coming week that will mark the final comments from policy makers before the central bank's Nov. 2-3 policy meeting, when it's possible the start of the tapering of its bond purchases could be launched.</p><p>Will another pop in 10-year Treasury yieldsBX:TMUBMUSD10Y stall out further gains in growth or technology stocks? Will the U.S. dollar rear back up to new highs? Will bad guidance from corporations and steadily retreating profit margins ultimately darken the mood on Wall Street?
