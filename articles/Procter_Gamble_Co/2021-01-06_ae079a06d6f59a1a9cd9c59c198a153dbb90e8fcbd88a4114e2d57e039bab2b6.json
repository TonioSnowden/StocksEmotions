  "text": "<p>Jeremy Darroch has stepped back as chief executive of Sky after 13 years at the helm and will exit the UK company at the end of 2021 after owner Comcast moved Dana Strong, the head of its residential US cable business, to the top job. </p> <p>Mr Darroch will move to the transitional role of executive chairman at the British pay-TV and broadband provider for the remainder of this year, having led the company during a successful period that culminated in its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ab1a246-bf48-11e8-95b1-d36dfef1b89a\">£30.6bn sale to Comcast</a> in 2018 and stayed on to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57a9dcf0-037f-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1\">plot a new strategy</a>. He will then become an adviser to the company.</p> <p>His departure represents the end of an era for Sky, with Comcast appointing a trusted executive from within its American ranks to lead the UK group at a time of upheaval in both its core markets. Comcast, America's largest cable and pay-TV company, with more than 30m users and $58bn in annual revenue, is looking to expand its presence in Europe. </p> <p>The appointment marks a return to the UK telecoms sector for Ms Strong. She was previously chief operating officer at Virgin Media and had been tipped for the top job before being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffb46392-029b-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5\">poached by Comcast</a> and moving to Philadelphia. </p> <p>Ms Strong will relocate from Pennsylvania to Sky's west London office in the coming weeks. She will take charge of delivering on its strategy to grow as a direct-to-consumer media provider across Europe, while its legacy satellite business contracts, as well as developing its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e964f2e4-c01b-11e8-8d55-54197280d3f7\">broadband and mobile strategy</a> at a time of consolidation in the telecoms sector. </p> <p>Claire Enders, the media analyst, described Ms Strong as “the shape of the future” for Sky, and said she had honed a methodical approach over the past three years running Comcast's residential cable business, which has 33m users. </p> <p>A former colleague said she was seen as a “powerful figure” within Virgin Media as she had previously worked at its parent company Liberty Global, a pattern which may be replicated at Sky given her time with its US owner. </p> <p>Mr Darroch's exit heralds the end of one of the longest chief executive tenures at the top of British business. He joined Sky in 2004 from Dixons as chief financial officer before replacing James Murdoch as chief executive three years later. </p> <p>Originally hailing from Alnwick in Northumberland, Mr Darroch cut his teeth at Procter &amp; Gamble. At Sky, he led the broadcaster's broadband battle with BT, merged its UK business with sister companies in Germany and Italy, and led the launch of Now TV, its streaming platform. </p> <p>He also reduced its reliance on sport, investing in original drama and arts while striking deals with HBO and Showtime, which brought shows such as <em>Game of Thrones</em> to its platform. Ms Enders said he also moved its strategy away from an antagonistic approach towards public service broadcasters that had persisted during the Murdoch rule. </p> <p>Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast, praised Mr Darroch for presiding over a “seamless integration” with the US company. </p> <p>“Jeremy has been a terrific colleague to me and everyone at Sky, but I respect his decision and I am pleased that he's agreed to stay on to help with the transition and advise the company,” he said. </p> <p>Mr Darroch said: “It has been a privilege to lead Sky for 13 years, and an experience that I have looked forward to every day, so my decision to leave has not been easy.”</p><p>Source: Nic Fildes in London 2021 'Veteran Sky chief Jeremy Darroch steps down ' FT.com 6 January.
