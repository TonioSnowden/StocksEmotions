  "title": "GlaxoSmithKline shares soar after Unilever bids for its consumer healthcare unit",
  "text": "<p>Driving the FTSE 100 higher and at the top of the Stoxx Europe 600's gainer's list, was GlaxoSmithKline GSKUK:GSK, up 3% after saying Saturday that it has rejected an unsolicited £50 billion ($68.4 billion) Unilever ULUK:ULVR offer for the unit behind painkiller Advil and Sensodyne toothpaste that it owns with Pfizer PFE, which owns a 32% equity stake against GSK's 68%.</p><p>Glaxo, which had been planning to spin off the unit, said it had received three separate bids from Unilever, the last coming Dec. 20.</p><p>At the top of the decliner's list, Unilever shares dropped 8%. The U.K. consumer goods group announced Monday that it will focus on higher-growth categories such as health, beauty and hygiene following a strategic review. That plan will include acquisitions and divesting lower growth brands and businesses, it said.</p><p>Some investors are hoping Unilever come up with a fourth bid. A team of Berenberg analysts led by James Targett, said it wll probably need to increase any new offer to £55 billion to get the deal done. That's as competing bids from Procter &amp; Gamble PG or private equity can't be ruled out, he said, in a note to clients.</p><p>And while Unliever's management is showing itself as “open to more transformative acquisitions,” questions are now also raised about its ability to accelerate growth with the current portfolio, he said.&#xa0;Divesting the food &amp; refreshment unit could fund a further bid for the Glaxo arm, but that would mean giving up some of Unilever's most attractive categories, said Targett.</p><p>Jefferies analysts also noted some “indigestion risk” for Glaxo shareholders of any deal.</p><p>“The mid-2022E spin of consumer is widely viewed as an event that could crystallize value, hence a sale likely dampens near-term appetite to own the stock at a time when the pipeline remains a work-in progress,” said a team led by analyst Peter Welford. A sale in the £50 billion ballpark would leave management with £34 billion in cash for that stake, leaving the company with £12 billion net cash.</p><p>“In theory this war chest provides ample strategic optionality to rebuild a pipeline and invest in focus therapeutic areas, but at least initially we expect many shareholders would fear a large acquisition and the risk of inferior returns,” said the analyst. Jefferies rates GlaxoSmithKline a buy.</p><p>Elsewhere, shares of Unliever rival Reckitt Benckiser UK:RKT rose 1.5%. The healthcare sector was rising across the board, with shares of Novo Nordisk NVODK:NOVO.B up 1% and Sanofi SNYFR:SAN rising 1.3%.</p><p>Investors were also absorbing data that showed China's economy expanded by 8.1% in 2021, but sank to 4% over a year earlier in the final three months of 2021.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 index XX:SXXP rose 0.5% to 483.79, coming off last week's 1% drop, the second straight weekly decline to start 2022.</p><p>The German DAX DX:DAX rose 0.2%, the French CAC 40 FR:PX1 rose nearly 0.4% and the FTSE 100 index UK:UKX climbed 0.6%. U.S. markets are closed Monday in observance of &#xa0;in observance of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.</p><p>The German DAX DX:DAX rose 0.2%, the French CAC 40 FR:PX1 rose nearly 0.4% and the FTSE 100 index UK:UKX climbed 0.6%.
