  "text": "<p>Wealthier households own most of the stock market. They may also hold the keys to a stock-market rebound—in the form of their own spending.</p><p>In recent weeks, many consumer-facing companies have warned of lower sales and earnings than Wall Street expected. Examples include KitchenAid owner Whirlpool, Korean electronics manufacturer Samsungand apparel labels like Adidas and H&amp;M. Packaged-goods giants such as Procter &amp; Gamble and Nestlé are making more money by raising prices, but still reported falling sales volumes.</p><p>This shouldn't be too surprising given soaring inflation. Globally, retail sales are tepid. On Monday, Purchasing Managers' Index indicators suggested that activity in the eurozone's services sector contracted in October at a pace consistent with a recession.</p><p>Other parts of the consumer economy, however, don't agree. Luxury companies like LVMH and Hermès keep defying market pessimism, and network carriers such as United Airlines, American Airlines and Lufthansa have all confirmed over the past week that demand for flying is booming. Britain's InterContinental said last week that hotel-room revenues are now above pre-Covid-19 levels.</p><p>Or take the craze in private jets while travel was restricted. It has barely eased: Only 3% of used jets are currently available for sale, compared with 10% to 12% historically, according to Bernstein Research. Manufacturers report that customers keep shifting to larger, more expensive aircraft.</p><p>The common factor here is that wealthier consumers, for whom essentials make up a smaller percentage of their spending baskets, are still happily shelling out on luxury and nice-to-have goods and services.</p><p>U.S. data by the Federal Reserve shows that, unusually, the largest percentage increase in net wealth during the pandemic was among the bottom 50% of households, but that a lot of it happened in the form of real estate. By contrast, the wealthy built up enormous cushions of currency and checkable deposits, which now form the largest part of their portfolio since records started in 1989.</p><p>Luxury goods and services have historically been less affected by recessions than their mainstream counterparts. Still, there are signs that this bifurcation is starker than in a typical slowdown, which could suggest that the better-off aren't done spending.</p><p>Data by Airbus-owned startup Skytra shows that, in Europe, where the energy crisis is hitting households harder, economy-class volumes for the fourth quarter relative to three years ago are down 21%, whereas business-class ones are up an eye-watering 28%. Bookings for these expensive fares are happening far ahead of the normal pattern for business fliers, which suggests that families are planning their vacations and splurging on fares.</p><p>It isn't just travel. California-based Fender Musical Instruments estimates that 30 million people picked up music as a hobby during the pandemic, lifting its sales to almost $1 billion last year, compared with $430 million in 2015. Suddenly, a big drop in demand has left the company grappling with a glut of entry-level \"Squier\" guitars made abroad, which are piling up at discounted prices. At the high end, though, it seems like many of the new bedroom rockstars are now treating themselves to more expensive gear.</p><p>\"We are completely sold out for every guitar made in the U.S. for this year and the remainder of next year,\" said Fender Chief Executive Andy Mooney.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How has the economy affected your spending habits? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Legacy airlines and musical-instrument companies, like many other consumer-facing businesses, make a lot of sales at the mass end of the market, but most of their earnings are generated through premium offerings. That might help explain why margins across the corporate economy are so far resisting this bout of inflation far better than they did in the 1970s and 1980s.</p><p>Investors remain skeptical this can last: They have punished the stocks of sectors like airlines and luxury retailers far more harshly than their recent earnings trends can explain. It could be a buying opportunity—as long as investors also remember to book expensive holidays and upgrade to a custom-made Fender Stratocaster.</p><p>Write to Jon Sindreu at jon.sindreu@wsj.com</p><p>For the Well-Off, the Economy Is Still in a Postpandemic Spending Boom</p>",
