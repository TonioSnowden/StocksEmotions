  "title": "Do You Need a Toothbrush as Complicated as a Dishwasher? Maybe. Competition in the $3 billion electric-toothbrush market has given rise to technological advances that border on obsessive—and have driven prices over $300. We asked dentists to weigh in on their effect on oral health.",
  "text": "<p>There is, however, one feature on both of them she could do without: their apps. Synced to a phone, the Quip app can collect data on how often and for how long you brush, and then award you points that can be redeemed at Target. The Philips app can locate the brush in real-time and direct you to spend enough time in each of four quadrants. In the abstract, one can see the value this could offer, especially for the more careless brusher. But cleaning her teeth while staring at a map of her mouth on her phone doesn't appeal to Ms. Burton. \"What a ridiculous concept, an app to go with my toothbrush,\" she said.</p><p>As the number of people that use electric toothbrushes has grown—research firm Statista estimates that over 131 million Americans have one and Indian research firm Fortune Business Insights says the global electric toothbrush market was worth $3.05 billion last year—so too has the number of available features they possess. Something like a built-in timer has become all but standard, even on brushes that cost less than a bottle of decent wine. And you often don't have to spend much more to get a brush that includes pressure sensors or Bluetooth. Some of these advances have been met with excitement from dentists and their patients, but the reception to others is more mixed.</p><p>A similar tension existed around the release of the BroxoDent, which plugged into an electrical outlet while in use. When the brush, invented in Switzerland in 1954, made it to the U.S. three years later, some reasonably wondered whether it was a good idea to combine a device that splashes a lot of water with live voltage. But the speedy back and forth movement of its bristles made the brush popular anyway, a boon to lazy adults and parents with children who needed a lure.</p><p>General Electric dethroned Broxo when it released the first cordless electric brush in 1961. Though the flashlight-sized battery-powered brush was clunky, its basic design became the blueprint for most electric toothbrushes released ever since.</p><p>The next truly significant innovation in brushing technology wouldn't come until 1992, when electrical engineer David Giuliani teamed up with Dr. David Engel and Dr. Roy Martin, both University of Washington dentistry professors, to release the first \"sonic\" toothbrush. With a more efficient motor than previous models, their brush head vibrated 12 times faster, which the company said made it more effective at cleaning your teeth. (The nomenclature comes from the fact that these motors move fast enough to produce a tonal hum.) The company the trio formed was purchased by a division of Philips in 2000. By the next year, according to a company representative, the freshly named Philips Sonicare was the most popular electric toothbrush in America.</p><p>Its main competition by then came from Oral-B, founded in California in 1950, whose latest appliances had speedy motors but were otherwise different from most other electric brushes. Instead of moving up and down, Oral-B's round brushes oscillate to the left and then to the right. In 2005, the company was bought by Procter &amp; Gamble, giving it plenty of funds for research and development.</p><p>Since then the space race has really taken off, and the electric toothbrush has become the Sputnik of oral hygiene: Handle-vibration changes signal 30-second intervals; rings of light indicate proper or too-much pressure; digital readouts tell you which mode of brushing you've chosen (everyday, sensitive, tongue brushing).</p><p>The latest salvo is connectivity; that is, sending data to the app on your phone via Bluetooth. The sophistication of these functions ranges from noting brushing time and frequency to 3-D tracking, which can show you exactly which part of your mouth needs more attention. And of course prices ballooned like NASA budgets. The top-of the line Philips Sonicare 9900 Prestige released last April clocks in at $330.</p><p>Enough research has been conducted on \"dumb\" electric toothbrushes for a 2021 meta-analysis in the International Journal of Dental Hygiene to conclude that electric models are more effective than manual and oscillating/rotating versions slightly more beneficial than high-frequency sonic brushes. Without much study of the effect of smart technology on oral health, we turned to dentists for their individual weigh-in.</p><p>Dr. Inna Chern, of New York General Dentistry, said that anyone who doesn't brush for the recommended two minutes would do well to buy an electric toothbrush with a timer, which is basically standard on today's models. And if the bristles on your brushes \"look like the dog got a hold of them, you should seek a more advanced model with a pressure sensor.\" That way, you don't accidentally wear out the layer of enamel protecting your pearly whites or damage gums.</p><p>In general, the five dentists we spoke with weren't bullish on smart electric toothbrushes, particularly when it comes to features like multiple brushing modes and mobile applications. Dr. Tim Donley, a Bowling Green, Ky., dentist paid by Philips Sonicare to share an expert perspective on the company's behalf, says these features are \"not essential to an effective oral care routine.\" For some people, though, these functions will \"elevate their brushing experience,\" which might make them more likely to use their brush.</p><p>Dr. Arezoo Nasiry, a dentist at LA Dental Clinic, in Los Angeles, expressed a similar sentiment. \"Whatever method of cleaning your teeth is actually something you will do every day, consistently, over time, is the method that is best for you,\" she said. While she thinks it's unnecessary for a brush to come with an app that reminds you to use it at night, she knows that many people like these features. \"If it is helpful and will encourage you to brush at least once a day for two minutes, why not?\"</p><p>Interestingly, there are people who are not suited to any type of electric toothbrush. Sometimes, Dr. Chern explained, \"people just assume because [the brush] is vibrating, or has sonic action, it is doing all the work for them. They don't pay as much attention.\" In those cases, while she could recommend a model with an app to involve the patient, she usually advises transitioning back to a manual brush.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What toothbrush does the best job of getting your teeth clean? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Dr. Chris Salierno, the chief dental officer of Tend, a dental practice with offices in New York, Washington, D.C., Boston and Atlanta, makes recommendations based on what he observes during an appointment. \"If a patient using a manual brush is able to keep themselves free from tooth decay and gum disease, and they have no other observable problems like excessive wear, I wouldn't look to fix what isn't broken,\" he said.</p><p>Ultimately, if you're looking to upgrade your brushing routine with a smart toothbrush, it may be worth considering whether you'll actually put the time into reading its manual before you drop serious dollars. Just ask Adrienne Katz, a 33-year-old experiential producer based in Brooklyn who also bought a DiamondClean 9500 in October.</p><p>\"I went purely on aesthetics,\" Ms. Katz said of buying her matte black brush. She appreciates that it has multiple heads, so she can share it with her partner, and that it has never lost charge, even over a 10-day trip. But she hasn't bothered to connect it with its app, nor intentionally tried any of its five different cleaning modes or three different intensity levels. While having a top-of-the-line brush hasn't hurt (her dentist has noticed a difference in her oral health) she admits she hasn't explored many of the features beyond \"on\" and \"off.\"</p><p>MENSA Applicants</p><p>These days, most electric toothbrushes include a built-in timer. Here's the lowdown on these four, which are a lot smarter. </p><p>PHOTO: F. Martin Ramin/ The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Quip Smart Electric Toothbrush</p><p>This direct-to-consumer upstart's app tracks and rewards consistent brushers with points that can be redeemed for Quip products or Target gift cards—making it a good option for kids. Powered by an AA battery, the brush is an easy add to any dopp kit, too. $70, GetQuip.com </p><p>PHOTO: F. Martin Ramin/ The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Colgate Hum</p><p>Its three different brushing modes may not affect your oral wellness. But the Colgate Hum's app not only tracks frequency and duration, it also syncs with your toothbrush so that you can see in real-time, on a map of your chompers, how much you've brushed. $70, Shop.Colgate.com </p><p>PHOTO: F. Martin Ramin/ The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Oral-B 10 Series 9</p><p>This toothbrush has an oscillating head and an app that can map your brushing technique across 16 zones of your mouth. But its most valuable characteristics are physical, like the ring of light underneath the brush head that turns red if you're brushing too hard. $300, OralB.com </p><p>PHOTO: F. Martin Ramin/ The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Philips Sonicare 9900 Prestige</p><p>Beyond an app with guided brushing and data collection, the Philips model includes SenseIQ technology. The brush will automatically vibrate less powerfully, for example, if you are \"scrubbing\" or applying too much pressure. $330, BestBuy.com</p><p>The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
