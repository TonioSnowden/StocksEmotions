  "text": "<p>   Unilever U.S. has voluntarily recalled several dry-shampoo aerosol products because of potentially elevated levels of benzene, a chemical that can cause cancer. </p><p>   The company produced the dry-shampoo products before October 2021 and sold them under the brands of Dove, Nexxus, Suave, Rockaholic, Bed Head and TRESemme, Unilever said. </p><p>   The U.S. subsidiary of Unilever PLC said it recalled a total of 19 dry-shampoo products. </p><p>   Unilever sold the products nationwide and informed retailers to remove the recalled products from their shelves, the company said. </p><p>   No other Unilever products are affected by the recall. </p><p>   Daily exposure to benzene in the recalled products at the levels detected in testing wouldn't be expected to cause adverse health consequences, Unilever said, citing an independent health-hazard evaluation. </p><p>   \"Unilever U.S. is recalling these products out of an abundance of caution,\" the company said. \"Unilever has received no reports of adverse events to date relating to this recall.\" </p><p>   The company didn't respond to a request for comment on Monday. </p><p>   An internal investigation by Unilever identified the products' propellant as the source. Unilever said it is working with its propellant suppliers to address this issue. </p><p>   Benzene can cause harmful effects on bone marrow and can cause a decrease in red blood cells, leading to anemia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can also cause excessive bleeding and can weaken the immune system, according to the CDC. </p><p>   Federal health officials also said long-term exposure to high levels of benzene can cause leukemia. </p><p>   Consumers can get information about reimbursements for these recalled products by visiting UnileverRecall.com. </p><p>   Unilever's American depositary receipts slipped 0.25% Monday to $44.45. </p><p>   Other aerosol products have been recalled in the past due to the possible presence of benzene. </p><p>    Johnson &amp; Johnson recalled most of its Neutrogena and Aveeno spray sunscreens from U.S. stores in July 2021 after detecting the cancer-causing chemical in some samples. </p><p>    Procter &amp; Gamble Co. recalled some Old Spice and Secret antiperspirant sprays after detecting benzene in some of its products in November. </p><p>    Edgewell Personal Care Co. also issued a voluntary recall in July of one of its Banana Boat sunscreen spray products after finding trace levels of the carcinogen in some samples. </p><p>   Both companies said the benzene came from propellant used in the spray cans. </p><p></p>",
