  "title": "Chanel Finds Its CEO Outside of Fashion Industry, at Unilever",
  "text": "<p>Alain Wertheimer, who owns privately held Chanel with his brother Gerard, will move from the CEO role to executive chairman early next year, Chanel said.</p><p>It's rare for luxury companies to hire top executives from outside the industry, which has traditionally favored insiders or -- in the case of the many family-run fashion houses -- scions of the business founders. One notable exception: Estee Lauder Cos. tapped Fabrizio Freda, a snack-food executive at Procter &amp; Gamble Co., to become its chief executive in 2009.</p><p>Ms. Nair joins a sector that analysts say is poised for rapid post-pandemic growth. Bain &amp; Co. forecasts that global luxury revenues will rise from an estimated 283 billion euros, equivalent to $320 billion, this year to around 370 billion euros, or $418 billion, in 2025.</p><p>Chanel, whose lines include fashion, fragrances, jewelry and skin care, was the world's sixth largest luxury group by revenue in 2020, according to Deloitte, with sales of $10.1 billion.</p><p>Like other big luxury groups, Chanel's sales took a hit from the pandemic, declining 17.6% in 2020 from the year before. That compared with an 11% decline for LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and a 17.5% drop at Kering SA.</p><p>Ms. Nair -- who has spent three decades at Unilever -- will be based in London, where Chanel has had its global headquarters since 2018.</p>",
