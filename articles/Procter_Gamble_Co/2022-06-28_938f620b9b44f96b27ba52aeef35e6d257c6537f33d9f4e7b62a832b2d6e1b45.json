  "title": "P&G, Target to Cover Employee Travel for Abortions; Big employers in Midwest states join tech giants and big banks in adding benefit after Supreme Court decision",
  "text": "<p>P&amp;G, which is based in Cincinnati and has 26,000 U.S. employees, said Tuesday its new policy is an extension of coverage already in place when travel is necessary to treat conditions such as organ transplants. Starting Jan. 1, this will include most covered medical procedures, including abortion, if a treatment isn't available within 50 miles of where an employee lives. About a half-dozen of P&amp;G's manufacturing facilities are in states with abortion bans.</p><p>\"This is an important issue to many people, and we recognize their broad range of views,\" a P&amp;G spokeswoman said. \"As we have for many years, P&amp;G supports our employees in having access to a wide range of healthcare options so they can determine what's best for them and their families.\"</p><p>Target, which has around 450,000 U.S. employees, said in a note sent Monday to staff that starting in July the company will reimburse travel expenses related to any healthcare that is needed and covered, but not available in a worker's community.</p><p>Target started reviewing the policy a few months ago, the company's human-resources chief, Melissa Kremer, wrote to workers. \"This effort became even more relevant as we learned about the Supreme Court's ruling on abortion, given that it would impact access to healthcare in some states,\" Ms. Kremer wrote.</p><p>Target is based in Minneapolis. Last week the state's governor signed an executive order that aims to protect the state's abortion providers and recipients from antiabortion laws in neighboring states. Target has around 2,000 stores across the country.</p><p>Kroger, which has around 420,000 U.S. workers and is also based in Cincinnati, said it provides employees enrolled in health plans with up to $4,000 to cover travel costs for a range of medical treatments, including abortion and fertility treatments. A spokeswoman said Kroger informed covered employees about the benefit on June 14 but didn't say how long the benefit has been in effect.</p><p>Other consumer companies that have announced similar moves recently include CVS Health Corp., Estee Lauder Cos. and Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. Earlier this year, after a leak of the draft Roe v. Wade decision, companies including Starbucks Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. said they would reimburse travel for medical services including abortion.</p><p>Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. recently told employees that they will pay for travel if people have to travel far from home for abortions. The banks, which employ tens of thousands of people around the country, described their decisions as ensuring equal access to healthcare.</p><p>P&amp;G, Target to Cover Employee Travel for Abortions</p>",
