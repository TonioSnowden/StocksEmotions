  "title": "Business News:  Unilever Warns of Price Rises  Accelerating, Sinking Stock  ----  By Nick Kostov",
  "text": "<p>   The maker of Dove soap and Hellmann's mayonnaise warned of accelerating price increases across a range of products, as it seeks to counter cost inflation across its business. </p><p>   Unilever PLC said Thursday that it was grappling with higher costs for ingredients, packaging and transportation, which would likely lower its full-year profitability -- a warning that sent shares down more than 5%. </p><p>   The London-listed consumer-goods giant said it would step up price increases across the world, having already raised prices 1.6% in the second quarter. </p><p>   \"We are going to have to take a little higher levels of price increase,\" Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly said. </p><p>   Inflation has continued to pick up pace, rising at the fastest pace in 13 years in the U.S. last month as the recovery from the pandemic gained steam and consumer demand drove up prices of everything from autos to restaurant meals. Other packaged-food manufacturers, including Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and General Mills Inc., have also warned of rising prices this year. </p><p>   Mr. Pitkethly said Unilever's large scale and strong inventories would help to mitigate the price rises but that several costs were out of the company's control and rising more than expected. The price of ingredients such as palm oil, crude oil and soybean oil all rose sharply in the quarter. </p><p>   Rising costs of commodities, increased marketing spend compared with last year and expenses linked to the Covid-19 pandemic have reduced Unilever's profitability, with the company saying its underlying operating margin in the first six months of the year fell 1 percentage point to 18.8% from a year earlier. The company now expects a slightly lower profit margin for the year. </p><p>   \"We're very focused on our pricing actions, which we think are landing well but inflation has been even higher than we anticipated,\" Mr. Pitkethly said. </p><p>   He added that the company had already been able to quickly increase prices in places such as Brazil and Argentina, but that doing so in Europe, for example, can take more time because the sales contracts it signs are often for longer periods. </p><p>   The comments came as Unilever reported a 5.4% rise in first-half underlying sales growth to 25.8 billion euros, equivalent to $30.4 billion, boosted by strong sales of its food and refreshment products. It attributed 4% of that growth to higher sales volumes, with 1.3% coming from higher prices. </p><p>   Net profit for the first six months of the year fell 5% to 3.12 billion euros because of a negative impact from currency fluctuations. </p><p>   Asked by analysts about its ice cream brand Ben &amp; Jerry's decision to stop selling its products in Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and contested East Jerusalem, Unilever Chief Executive Alan Jope said the consumer-goods giant was committed to Israel and that the decision was taken by the brand's independent board. Unilever bought Ben &amp; Jerry's in 2000 and pledged at the time to allow the brand's directors to make decisions about its social mission. </p><p></p>",
