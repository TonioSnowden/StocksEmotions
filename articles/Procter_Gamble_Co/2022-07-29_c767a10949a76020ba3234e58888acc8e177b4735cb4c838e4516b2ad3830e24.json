  "text": "<p>Both companies are growing their top lines. In the quarter ended in June, P&amp;G's organic sales, which strip out merger and currency impacts, rose 7% from a year earlier, and Colgate's grew by 9%. In both cases that was largely due to price increases. Colgate's underlying volumes rose 0.5% and P&amp;G's declined by 1%.</p><p>Still, it is encouraging that these companies have been able to push through price increases without seeing declines in demand. The question is how long this can last, and both companies seemed cautious on this point. On Colgate's conference call, Chief Executive Officer Noel Wallace said demand could become more sensitive to prices going forward. The company hasn't seen global consumers \"trading down\" to cheaper or private label goods, \"but it's early days, we'll see how that evolves over time,\" he said.</p><p>P&amp;G, whose fiscal year ended in June, gave a disappointing forecast for the current one. Organic sales, it said, would grow by 3% to 5%, a slowdown from the 7% pace of the just-ended year. Earnings per share, at the midpoint of P&amp;G's guidance, would rise 2% to $5.93. Analysts had been expecting earnings of $6.02, according to FactSet.</p><p>Headwinds including inflation in commodity and freight costs, as well as the strong dollar, are putting a combined 23 percentage point \"headwind\" on earnings per share growth over the period, the company said.</p><p>\"The list of challenges we are facing heading into a new fiscal year is longer than any I can recall,\" said Chief Executive Officer Jon Moeller on a conference call.</p><p>What is more, P&amp;G in particular, whose portfolio emphasizes premium brands like Gillette and Bounty, could be especially vulnerable to trade downs if the economy keeps worsening. P&amp;G Chief Financial Officer Andre Schulten said the company is seeing private label goods gain some ground in the U.S. and Europe, though he said this isn't yet coming at the expense of P&amp;G's own brands. Prices for private label goods are rising too, Mr. Moeller said.</p><p>Colgate shares were down around 1.5% and P&amp;G shares fell around 5% in early trading Friday. So far this year through Thursday, the two companies' shares were down 7.2% and 9.5%, respectively. Granted that is better than the S&amp;P 500's decline of 14.5%, but investors are unlikely to be pleased. Contrast that with food and beverage companies, which are performing well: Campbell Soup and Coca-Cola, for instance, are up 13% and 8.2%, respectively, this year through Thursday.</p><p>In short, investors have been betting that consumers will sooner settle for a thinner paper towel than an off-brand soda. P&amp;G and Colgate did nothing to change their minds Friday.</p><p>Write to Aaron Back at aaron.back@wsj.com</p><p>These Consumer Staples Aren't Looking So Safe</p>",
