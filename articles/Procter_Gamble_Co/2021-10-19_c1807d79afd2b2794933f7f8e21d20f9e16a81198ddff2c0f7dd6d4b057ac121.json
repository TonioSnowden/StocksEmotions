  "title": "U.S. Stocks Rise as Companies Report Earnings; P&G's shares fall after the consumer-products giant says it is raising prices on household staples",
  "text": "<p>Third-quarter earnings season is in its early days, with about 10% of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported. Of those, roughly four out of five have beaten profit forecasts, according to FactSet.</p><p>Traders on Tuesday rewarded companies that impressed the market with their results. Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson rose 3.1% after the company logged a larger profit in its third quarter than a year earlier, lifted by higher sales in its pharmaceutical, medical-device and consumer-health divisions. Travelers shares climbed 2.9% after the insurance company beat estimates for revenue and core income per share.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble shares, by contrast, fell 1.6% after the consumer-product giant said it was raising prices on a host of household staples, as costs for freight and raw materials rose faster than anticipated.</p><p>Investors are scrutinizing earnings reports and guidance for the future to assess how companies are faring with a number of key issues. Inflation is expected to be stickier than originally anticipated by central-bank officials, exacerbated by continued supply-chain disruptions, higher energy costs and labor shortages. Some investors expect supply problems will pinch companies' sales.</p><p>\"Will the market look through some of these supply constrained sales shortfalls?\" said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \"I think the market should, because I don't think the consumer is going to walk away and not buy even if they have to wait a month or two.\"</p><p>Bitcoin's dollar value rose about 1.9% from its 5 p.m. ET level Monday, trading at $62,611 Tuesday. The U.S.'s first bitcoin exchange-traded fund rose modestly in its debut Tuesday. Cryptocurrency analysts say they will be watching to see how strong flows into the fund are, to assess whether the cryptocurrency's recent price rally will hold.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 1.633% Tuesday from 1.583% Monday. Yields rise when bond prices fall.</p><p>Fresh data showed that construction of new homes in the U.S. decreased in September after rising in August. Builders have been caught between strong demand from buyers—spurred in part by low interest rates—and shortages of materials, labor and lots.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.3%, while most major indexes in Asia closed higher. China's Shanghai Composite gained 0.7%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 1.5%. South Korea's Kospi and Japan's Nikkei 225 each added about 0.7%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Karen Langley at karen.langley@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Rise as Companies Report Earnings</p>",
