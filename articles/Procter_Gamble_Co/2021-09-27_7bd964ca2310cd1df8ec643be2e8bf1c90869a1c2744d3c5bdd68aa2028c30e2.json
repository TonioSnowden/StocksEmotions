  "title": "Charles de Vilmorin: fresh star of Parisian fashion",
  "text": "<p>There's no doubt Charles de Vilmorin is a fast-rising star of Paris fashion. In April 2020, aged 23, he launched his eponymous label on Instagram, mid-pandemic. Within months, the industry buzz around him saw one of his creations, (a psychedelic bomber jacket) appear in an Apple commercial on American rapper Tierra Whack. Soon after that, Jean Paul Gaultier sponsored him to show as an on-schedule guest at Paris Haute Couture Week in January this year. Two weeks later, he was named the new creative director of storied French fashion house Rochas.</p> <p>Founded in 1925 by French designer Marcel Rochas, the house had been best known for its signature perfume, Femme. Following the death of the designer in 1955, the fashion arm of the business shuttered, only to be relaunched in 1990 under its fragrance owner Wella, then acquired by Procter &amp; Gamble. Following a critically successful four years under Olivier Theyskens as artistic director, P&amp;G shuttered the brand's fashion division once again from 2006 to 2008. Italian designer Marco Zanini then threw his hat in the ring, followed by Alessandro dell'Acqua whose departure in December 2019 led to a year where the house was without a creative director. </p> <p>De Vilmorin has an interesting heritage of his own. Much has been made of the designer's connection to poet, novelist and society woman Louise de Vilmorin (his grandfather's great aunt), who also happened to be a close friend of Hélène Rochas, wife and muse of founder Marcel. However, neither de Vilmorin nor Rochas knew of their family ties when he was offered the appointment. And, yes, there is a castle that bears his family name, Château de Vilmorin in Verrières-le-Buisson. But he's never been there. In reality, the designer says he spends most of his time crouched over his sewing machine on the floor of his Parisian chambre de bonne. </p> <p>“It's true that my family, in general, is super creative and taught me a lot about art and culture,” explains de Vilmorin, whose mother is an art professor and whose father is a financial director. “In some articles, [it is written] that I am from a very rich family and that I am [at Rochas] because Louise de Vilmorin was a friend of Hélène Rochas, but it's totally false.</p> <p>Aged 24 and very poised, de Vilmorin peppers his speech with charming franglais superlatives like, ‘mega', ‘totally', ‘super' and ‘dingue!' (crazy). He studied at the École de la Chambre Syndicale de la Mode et de la Couture, (followed by a masters at l'Institut Français de la Mode). De Vilmorin's world is dreamlike and fantastic, his silhouettes overblown and his palettes cheerful, blending the surreal with the streetwise. “The Charles de Vilmorin woman is a bit shy, a bit ‘trash'. She doesn't know where she wants to go, but she goes. She corresponds [more] to me, she's naive and a bit . . . ” he pauses, searching for the word. “Maladroit!”</p> <p>His first collection for his own label, a ready-to-wear series of bomber jackets, was decorated in painterly, acid-hued prints hand drawn by the designer. These pieces evolved into his couture offering of leggings, bigger bombers and puffed sleeve dresses, dripping in painted butterflies, rainbows and clown prints in eye-watering colours, informed by Chagall, Dalí, Matisse and Niki de Saint Phalle. </p> <p>How will he reconcile this aesthetic to that of the more classic, elegant Rochas. “The Rochas woman and the Charles de Vilmorin woman are absolutely not the same. It's two totally different stories,” he offers. “The Rochas woman has a past. She's more confident, more sophisticated.” </p> <p>De Vilmorin says that founder Marcel Rochas created the brand in service of his wife, Hèlène in 1925, but he wants “to tell the story of a more independent woman who doesn't need the help of her husband. I love the story of Rochas, but I think now we need the story of a woman that is super free.”</p> <p>It's a vision shared by Fabio Ducci, president of High Italian Manufacturing (known previously as Onward Luxury Group), the licensing partner of Rochas. The brand's parent company, Interparfums, announced the extension of its partnership with HIM for the Rochas women's line on the same day of de Vilmorin's appointment: “We really believe in Charles's interpretation and understanding of the Rochas universe, especially his emphasis on romanticism, and his ability to embrace the brand's past while guiding it into a new era.”</p> <p>De Vilmorin's first collection for the brand, Resort 2022, has yet to hit stores. Though the collection was shown only to a few buyers, Ducci notes it piqued interest. “This collection is a deliberate break with the past, and it resonates most with our commercial partners who are forward thinking and experimental,” he says. De Vilmorin's second collection, which will be shown Wednesday in Paris, will take a starting point of a woman in the midst of a house fire, frantically flinging herself into her wardrobe to save her precious Rochas. The blaze scorches flame prints across gold-pleated lurex, trompe l'oeil jacquard that appears to drip from the heat and flame-hued shoes and boots.</p> <p>When asked why he thinks Rochas chose him out of a handful of hopefuls, de Vilmorin says: “I think they liked the fact that I wasn't scared of doing a runway presentation with clothing embroidered with erotic motifs and bizarre stuff. I proposed something more transgressive, all the while staying within the codes of French couture.”</p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em> on Instagram</em></p><p>Source: Divya Bala 2021 'Charles de Vilmorin: fresh star of Parisian fashion' FT.com 27 September.
