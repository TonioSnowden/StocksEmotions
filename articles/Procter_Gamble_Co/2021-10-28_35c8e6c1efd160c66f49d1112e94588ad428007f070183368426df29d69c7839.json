  "title": "Biden Stock Buyback Tax: What to Know About the Latest Proposal; A 1% excise tax on share repurchases is floated as buybacks approach pre-pandemic records; will companies pay up or pull back?",
  "text": "<p>Many public companies use cash flow to repurchase, or buy back, their own shares in the market. The move reduces the number of shares outstanding and can improve the per-share earnings companies report each quarter to investors. It can also push share prices up, research shows.</p><p>Wall Street generally welcomes buybacks as a sign that a company's board and executives are confident about the prospects of the business and have enough spare cash after investing in the business and paying any dividends. Critics—whose number has included Warren Buffett—say companies don't always use the strategy wisely, and that there are sometimes better uses for the money.</p><p>Companies and analysts say public corporations also buy back shares to offset stock-based compensation paid to a range of employees in some industries, in addition to executives. Issuing shares as pay would otherwise dilute the value of existing shareholders' stakes.</p><p>What is a buyback tax?</p><p>The administration is proposing a 1% excise tax on the amount companies spend to repurchase their own shares. There is currently no such tax on buyback activity, so the measure, if it becomes law, could cause boards and executives to re-evaluate how they allocate capital.</p><p>The Biden administration, in a summary of the proposal, said share repurchases are a costly exercise that serve to enrich executives by driving up the price of shares that they receive as compensation. Executives \"too often use [buybacks] to enrich themselves rather than investing workers and growing their businesses,\" the summary states.</p><p>It is unclear whether the proposed tax would apply to all buybacks, or include an exemption for some or all of the shares used to offset equity-based compensation.</p><p>The new proposal resembles a 2% buyback tax proposed in Septemberby Sens. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) and Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), that specified exceptions for minimal share buybacks and those used to fund employee pension plans or employee stock-ownership plans, or which are part of an employee stock plan. That proposal specified that the tax payments wouldn't themselves be tax-deductible.</p><p>How much have companies spent on buybacks?</p><p>Buybacks among the S&amp;P 500 in 2021 are on track to surpass 2019's $729 billion, but could fall about 5% short of 2018's record $806 billion, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p><p>Companies in the S&amp;P 500, including Target Corp., Campbell Soup Co., eBay Inc. and Home Depot Inc., since the beginning of the year have announced 114 new share-repurchase programs through Sept. 8, S&amp;P said. Those programs, many of which don't have an expiration date, authorize $358.84 billion in buybacks.</p><p>Dividend payments are also on the rise, and likely to set new records in the third quarter and for all of 2021, Mr. Silverblatt said.</p><p>Buybacks could surge late this year if a surtax seems likely to apply in the new year, Mr. Silverblatt noted. \"Any significant or serious buyback tax consideration in Washington could bring accelerated buying near year-end 2021,\" he wrote earlier this month.</p><p>How much money would a buyback tax raise?</p><p>The Biden administration estimates the 1% excise tax will raise about $125 billion over 10 years, but notes the figure is subject to revision with a more detailed analysis. The proposal released Thursday has few details.</p><p>\"I don't know how much revenue this is going to raise,\" said Rohit Kumar, Washington national tax services co-leader at tax and accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, speaking generally about a buyback tax before the Biden proposal was announced. \"It seems like some of this will end up in dividends, rather than buybacks.\"</p><p>Supporters of the buyback tax acknowledge companies can instead shift spending to regular or special dividends, which would be taxed to the recipients.</p><p>\"Isn't that the issue with stock buybacks?\" said Steve Wamhoff, director of federal tax policy at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a progressive Washington think-tank.</p><p>The buyback tax is part of a broader plan that includes a 15% minimum tax on corporate profits, estimated to raise $325 billion; an expansion of taxes on the foreign earnings of U.S. companies, at $350 billion; and a surcharge on the income of the very richest Americans, at $230 billion.</p><p>How could a buyback tax affect corporate strategy?</p><p>Companies likely will review their financial models to determine what the impact of the new tax would be. \"It changes the calculus\" and could lead some companies to reconsider their spending plans, said John Gimigliano, principal-in-charge for federal legislative and regulatory services in KPMG's national tax practice.</p><p>Boards often prefer buybacks because they can be stopped and started as needed, while investors tend to object to dividend reductions. Investors often like buybacks because they can choose whether to sell, or hold and benefit from any share-price appreciation that results.</p><p>\"Share repurchases are easier to pull back from,\" S&amp;P's Mr. Silverblatt said, pointing to the greater flexibility that buybacks provide to chief financial officers compared with other forms of capital use.</p><p>One criticism of a buyback tax: It raises costs for companies that use forms of equity as compensation, both for top executives and, in some industries, a broader swath of employees. That could discourage companies from using stock as pay, PwC's Mr. Kumar said, which can be an avenue to ensure workers share in a company's success.</p><p>\"The most direct way to make that connection is by giving employees an ownership stake in the company,\" he said. \"There's a reasonable chance you get less employee compensation in the form of equity grants and options—and is that really the result Congress is intending?\"</p><p>Academic research has shown that companies don't always repurchase shares when prices are low or hold off when prices are high, raising questions about how much an excise tax will affect behavior.</p><p>Which companies spend the most on buybacks?</p><p>Large communications and tech companies spent the most on stock buybacks during the third quarter this year, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. Almost two dozen communications companies spent $29.8 billion on buybacks, while 75 tech companies spent $25.4 billion. Energy and real-estate companies spent the least.</p><p>Facebook Inc., which S&amp;P classifies as a communications company, topped the list in the third quarter, spending $15 billion to repurchase shares, while Alphabet Inc., which owns Google, spent $12.6 billion.</p><p>American Express Co. spent the most among financial companies buying back shares, at $3.3 billion. Procter &amp; Gamble Co., at $2.75 billion, spent the most among consumer companies, followed by eBay, at $2.3 billion. Hospital company HCA Healthcare also spent $2.3 billion.</p><p>Kristin Broughton contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Theo Francis at theo.francis@wsj.com and Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Stock Buyback Tax: What to Know About the Latest Proposal</p>",
