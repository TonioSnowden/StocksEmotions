  "title": "These 10 dividend-paying stocks show why cash isn't trash in a brutal market",
  "text": "<p>Dividend stocks give shareholders regular cash payouts year after year. They confer several advantages on companies and investors. For investors, cash dividends put money in your pocket.&#xa0; You receive a return on investment without having to sell any shares. Dividends also put a floor under the price of a dividend-paying stocks; they fall less when the market swoons.&#xa0;</p><p>Why? Investors calculate the value of dividends in relation to stock price. A $10 dividend on a $100 stock pays a 10% dividend yield.&#xa0; If the stock falls to $50, that same dividend spells a 20% dividend yield. Investors flock to such high dividend yields, supporting the price.</p><p>Another benefit of dividends, for both shareholders and companies: managers are less tempted to squander cash on bad ideas, from research rabbit holes to overpriced acquisitions.</p><p>Also, regular cash dividends give investors reason to stick with a company and even buy more shares in times of trouble. The result is a base of higher-quality shareholders, those with patience, focus and stock-picking skill. In fact, all of the companies with the longest sustained history of paying cash dividends are among the favorites of quality shareholders.&#xa0;</p><p>For example, I compared a list of the top 20 dividend stocks from the annual ranking of&#xa0;so-called Dividend Aristocrats&#xa0;to a database of 2,695 stocks followed by my&#xa0;QualityShareholders Initiative&#xa0;at George Washington University.&#xa0; All 20 of those stocks ranked in the top third for quality shareholders; 14 were in the top 15% and nine landed in the top 10%. &#xa0;</p><p>Topping the list: Procter &amp; Gamble PG, 3M MMM, Coca-Cola KO, Colgate-Palmolive CL, Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ, AbbVie ABBV, Abbott Laboratories ABT, PepsiCo PEP, Automatic Data ProcessingAutomatic Data Processing ADP and Kimberly-Clark KMB. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p><p>Dividend-paying stocks can be excellent long-term investments, but not every dividend stock is a great buy.&#xa0; Companies may pay high dividends because they are at dead-ends, without opportunities to grow profits or margins.</p><p>By the same token, not all companies should pay dividends. If a company has dazzling growth opportunities, either in its existing businesses or ones it can acquire, it and its shareholders are better off skipping the dividends.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p><p>To help understand the difference, and before loading up on dividend paying stocks, see if the company's board or managers explain how they think about dividends.&#xa0; Directors have almost total discretion over dividend policy so this is an excellent measure of their stewardship.</p><p>Directors also should show that they understand that their job is to allocate every corporate dollar to its best use.&#xa0;Possible uses include reinvesting in the current business, acquiring new ones, buying back underpriced shares in the open market, or paying cash dividends.</p><p>Companies who explain their dividend policy well — whether they pay regular dividends or not — are companies worth looking at as investment opportunities, because it signals that managers and directors think like owners.&#xa0;Among the Dividend Aristocrats, if they attract high quality shareholders they're probably good stocks to own, especially in troubled times.</p><p>Lawrence A.&#xa0;Cunningham&#xa0;is a professor at George Washington University, founder of the&#xa0;Quality Shareholders Group, and publisher, since 1997, of&#xa0;“The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America.”&#xa0;For updates on Cunningham's research about quality shareholders,&#xa0;sign up here.&#xa0;</p><p>Stay in the know.&#xa0;Sign up here&#xa0;to get MarketWatch's best mutual funds and ETF stories emailed to you weekly!</p><p>More:Global dividends surge as pandemic recovery fades</p><p>Also read: Why mutual fund giants are quietly giving voting power back to individual shareholders</p>",
