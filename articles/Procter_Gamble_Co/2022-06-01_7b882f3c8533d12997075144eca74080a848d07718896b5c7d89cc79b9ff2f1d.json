  "title": "Heard on the Street:  P&G-Style  Makeover Is  A Big Ask  For Unilever  ---  Activist's hopes for a  repeat may be too high  ----  By Carol Ryan",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n   Unilever has similar problems to those Procter &amp; Gamble faced four years ago, and now has the same activist investor on its board. But times otherwise have moved on. </p><p>\n  On Tuesday, Unilever said Trian Partners founder Nelson Peltz will take a seat on the company's board from July. After months of speculation that the activist bought shares in Unilever, the company confirmed his hedge fund owns a 1.5% stake, currently valued at around $1.6 billion. Mr. Peltz will join Unilever's compensation committee and may want changes to pay incentives. </p><p>\n  At P&amp;G, he criticized targets that rewarded top executives for sales growth that was below the industry average. </p><p>\n  Unilever's shares rose more than 9% on Tuesday. </p><p>\n  Investors may be hoping that an activist campaign at the U.K. company will create a P&amp;G-style uplift in the share price. The U.S. company's stock almost doubled in value between early 2018 when Mr. Peltz got a board seat and when he stood down 3 1/2 years later. </p><p>\n  Trian's record at its last big European target in the sector is patchier. The fund disclosed a stake in Evian bottled water maker Danone in November 2012, when the company's shares were trading at around 48 euros, equivalent to $51. After predicting the stock would hit 78 euros within two years, the fund cashed out in February 2015 when it was priced at roughly 60 euros. </p><p>\n  The presence of an activist investor may speed up the disposal of Unilever's less appealing brands. Earlier this year, Chief Executive Alan Jope said he was open to a sale of the company's food brands to fund a bid for GlaxoSmithKline's consumer healthcare business -- although this approach was called off. </p><p>\n  Selling underperforming beauty brands to Coty helped to improve P&amp;G's sales growth, but the biggest boost came from doing a better job with its existing brands. Between 2015 and 2019, stopping market share losses delivered 2.4 percentage points of additional sales growth, based on Bernstein estimates. </p><p>\n  Unilever is making progress here. In the first quarter, 58% of its business was winning market share, up from 53% in the fourth quarter of 2021. </p><p>\n  This will be tough to maintain as consumer incomes are squeezed. Private-label brands are winning customers in Europe, where inflation is running at 8.1%. Big brands need to increase prices to protect their profit margins, but their products are less competitive as a result. Danone, Unilever and Nestle all lost market share to store brands in Europe over the four weeks to April 24, according to Nielsen data. </p><p>\n  Unilever has a particular challenge because of where it sells. It makes 60% of group sales in emerging markets, where inflation is higher than in developed countries and average incomes lower. P&amp;G makes half its sales in North America, where consumer spending is for now proving resilient. </p><p>\n  A board refresh is good news for Unilever investors, but the company is embarking on a turnaround in a much tougher market than P&amp;G. </p><p></p>",
