  "title": "Banking & Finance: Former P&G CEO Joins Private-Equity Firm",
  "text": "<p>Based in New York, CD&amp;R has long employed a model of pairing investing professionals with experts in running companies -- known as operating partners or advisers -- to buy businesses and attempt to improve their performances.</p><p>Mr. Taylor will join a roster of top executives who have come to the private-equity firm from American companies, including John Compton, former PepsiCo Inc. president, and Sandra Peterson, previously group world-wide chairman at Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p>Operating partners have been known to step in and lead portfolio companies on an interim basis, such as a recent stint by Mr. Compton at the helm of the CD&amp;R-owned pet-products maker, Radio Systems Corp.</p><p>CD&amp;R, which manages about $57 billion, is in the process of trying to raise at least $20 billion for its next fund, The Wall Street Journal has reported.</p><p>The firm was founded in 1978 by Joseph Rice, Martin Dubilier and Eugene Clayton. Mr. Rice had come from investment banking, while Messrs. Dubilier and Clayton had worked as corporate executives and management consultants. The three, according to the firm, determined that finding a way to blend their collective skills was more important than financial engineering when it came to achieving sustainable performance in the buyout business.</p><p>Today the firm gets over 80% of its returns from operating improvements at its portfolio companies, with the remainder from adjusting capital structures and other factors, said CD&amp;R Chief Executive Nate Sleeper.</p><p>During his tenure at P&amp;G, Mr. Taylor, 64 years old, held leadership roles in operations and marketing, managed manufacturing sites and led various consumer brands.</p><p>He took over as CEO in 2015, when P&amp;G was struggling to expand. Mr. Taylor doubled down on P&amp;G's stalwart brands, which include Tide and Gillette. His strategy worked, particularly during the pandemic, when consumers flocked to the best-known names.</p>",
