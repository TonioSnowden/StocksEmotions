  "text": "<p>Wall Street stocks eased off their peak on Friday, while European equities rose, as traders weighed strong corporate earnings against persistent concerns over elevated global inflation. </p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 slipped 0.1 per cent on Friday in New York, having logged an all-time high a day earlier. </p> <p>The Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.8 per cent, weighed down by weak tech stocks. The soggy performance contrasted with a more upbeat session in Europe, where the Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.5 per cent, taking its gain during October so far to almost 4 per cent. </p> <p>The Stoxx 600 has now recouped all of its losses chalked up in September, when global stock markets were weighed down by stagflation fears caused by spiralling energy costs, pandemic-related supply chain disruptions and the prospect of central banks raising interest rates to combat high consumer prices. </p> <p>“Early commentary from firms thus far suggests demand strength remains intact,” Barclays strategists led by Emmanuel Cau said a note to clients. </p> <p>This week, consumer goods groups Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble said they had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/369c1596-ea3a-41d2-9f78-6377db77191e\">managed to raise prices</a> to pass on higher input costs to customers. After the bell on Wednesday, electric car maker Tesla posted its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e084713-1506-4256-b00b-59cb6125d2c1\">highest quarterly profit</a>, helping to nudge Wall Street's blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index up to a closing high on Thursday.</p> <p>However, Erik Knutzen, chief investment officer for multi-asset at Neuberger Berman, said he expected a potentially volatile ride ahead. </p> <p>On Friday, social media platform Snap slid more than 26 per cent after warning of reduced advertising revenue. Other technology bellwethers such as Google parent Alphabet and Facebook also suffered losses, falling 3 per cent and 5.1 per cent, respectively. </p> <p>“There is still a lot of worry to get past,” Knutzen said. “We are looking for lower entry points before we pile in.” </p> <p>Central banks are grappling over how to respond to inflation shocks when economic growth is moderating.</p> <p>Huw Pill, the Bank of England's chief economist, told the Financial Times on Thursday that the headline rate of UK inflation <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bce7b1c5-0272-480f-8630-85c477e7d69c\">could exceed 5 per cent</a> next year, and said the central bank would have a “live” decision on whether to raise interest rates from a current record low next month. </p> <p>Rates and currency markets were now “pricing in multiple rate hikes next year for the Fed, and as soon as December for the BoE”, Barclays' Cau said. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve, in its Beige Book assessment of economic conditions released earlier in the week, said a rebound in US growth from the shocks of coronavirus had now “slowed”, citing supply chain shocks, worker shortages and the continued spread of the virus. </p> <p>The yield on the two-year US Treasury note, which moves inversely to its price and reflects monetary policy expectations, ended the day roughly flat at 0.46 per cent, have sold off in earlier trading. </p> <p>In a sign, however, of concerns about future growth, the longer-term US government bond gained in price, pushing yields lower. The 10-year yield fell 0.06 percentage points to 1.64 per cent in afternoon trade in New York.</p> <p>Asian markets were mixed. China's CSI 300 index rose 0.6 per cent while Tokyo's Topix closed flat. </p> <p>The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six currencies, fell 0.2 per cent as appetite for riskier assets increased. This dollar gauge touched a one-year high in September but has dropped roughly 0.7 per cent this month. </p> <p>Brent crude, the oil benchmark, settled up 1.1 per cent to $85.53 a barrel, remaining close to its highest level in three years. </p><p>Source: Naomi Rovnick in London and Joe Rennison in New York 2021 'US stocks pull back from record highs ' FT.com 22 October.
