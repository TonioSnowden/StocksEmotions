  "text": "<p>The financial boost is critical for these manufacturers, which are spending billions of dollars to build battery plants and shift their lineups to electric vehicles.</p><p>Both Ford Motor Co. and global car maker Stellantis NV reported double-digit increases in their net results last week. General Motors Co.'s second quarter was softer, mostly due to continued parts shortages, but it still delivered a net profit of $1.69 billion and reaffirmed its year-end guidance.</p><p>\"Inventory on the ground at dealers hasn't changed in really about six quarters, even as production has gone up,\" said Paul Jacobson, GM's chief financial officer. \"There's a big pocket of demand that hasn't been met yet,\" he added.</p><p>The upbeat tone is unusual for the car business, which is typically among the first sectors to get hit by any downturn in consumer sentiment.</p><p>The U.S. government said Friday that household spending rose faster in June, but economists say overall it has slowed sharply when inflation is taken into account.</p><p>Retailing-giant Walmart Inc. and consumer-products firm Procter &amp; Gamble Co. both warned that higher prices were leading shoppers to pull back, an ominous sign for the U.S. economy.</p><p>Some auto makers are starting to take steps to recession-proof their business, including initiating widespread layoffs, and to respond to other pressures, such as higher commodity costs, rising interest rates and factory shutdowns in Asia related to rising Covid-19 infections.</p><p>GM said that it would curtail hiring and take precautions to slim down further if economic challenges worsen. Electric-vehicle makers Tesla Inc. and Rivian Automotive Inc. have disclosed plans to cut thousands of salaried workers following earlier hiring sprees.</p><p>Ford has also embarked on a broad restructuring to shave $3 billion in annual costs and bolster its transition to electric-vehicles. In coming weeks, the Dearborn, Mich., auto maker is expected to disclose plans to cut more than 4,000 white-collar workers, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.</p><p>\"We absolutely have too many people in certain places, no doubt about it,\" said Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley. . He didn't confirm or respond directly to questions about the workforce reductions.</p><p>Auto executives and dealers say the industry overall is in a much stronger position than in previous downturns. It is also aided by somewhat unusual conditions:</p><p>The prolonged inventory crunch on dealer lots has led to accumulating pent-up demand and buyers willing to pay a hefty premium for cars and trucks that are available.</p><p>Mike Manley, chief executive of publicly traded dealership chain AutoNation Inc., said if there is an economic downturn, consumers' appetite for mid- to higher-priced vehicles, including those in the luxury category, is likely to remain strong.</p><p>\"If we are going to go into a recessionary period, that's going to be the middle to the last demographic that gets hit,\" Mr. Manley said.</p><p>AutoNation said earlier this month that as many as 50% of the vehicles incoming to its dealerships over the next few months are presold, and some models, such as the Ford Bronco, are sold out for more than a year.</p><p>Meanwhile, the average price paid for a vehicle continues to nudge higher, hitting another record in June of $45,844, according to industry research firm J.D. Power.</p><p>And more buyers are taking out bigger car payments. The number with auto loans costing at least $1,000 a month hit a record 12.7% in June, according to Edmunds, a car-shopping website and data-analytics company.</p><p>Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said that the company's global shipments could fall about 50% and it would still break even.</p><p>He said he believes Europe is more at risk of a recession and the U.S. would have a milder downturn. \"We have a very low break-even point,\" Mr. Tavares said. on the company's earnings call. \"That is going to give us significant sustainability to face any unpredictable crisis.\"</p><p>Still, supply-chain disruptions and a long-running computer-chip shortage continue to weigh on the industry's outlook. GM's sales in the second-quarter were disproportionately hit by such obstacles, leaving it with 95,000 unfinished vehicles it couldn't sell during the period.</p><p>\"We've been dealing with some of these chip issues for the last couple years,\" GM's Mr. Jacobson said. \"This one was a little late breaking.\"</p><p>The supply constraints are depressing sales, which in the U.S. were down 18.2% industrywide to 6.7 million vehicles in the first six months, according to Wards Intelligence, a firm that tracks auto industry data.</p><p>Affordability is also becoming a bigger concern as surging car prices have pushed many budget-conscious buyers out of both the new and used car markets.</p><p>Some executives say once dealership stock bounces back, it could be difficult for car companies to sustain the premium pricing.</p><p>\"Consumer sentiment is all over the map,\" Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said on the EV maker's earnings call this month.</p><p>Tesla had its first sequential decline in quarterly profit in more than a year in the second quarter, hurt by an extended shutdown at its Shanghai plant due to local Covid-19 restrictions.</p><p>But Mr. Musk said he isn't concerned about weakening demand for Tesla, whose customers face monthslong waits for many vehicle configurations.</p><p>\"We have so much excess demand that was really just not an issue for us,\" he said on the call.</p><p>---</p><p>Mike Colias, Rebecca Elliott and Nora Eckert contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
