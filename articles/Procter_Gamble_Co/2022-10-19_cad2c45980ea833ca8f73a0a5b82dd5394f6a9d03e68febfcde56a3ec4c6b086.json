  "text": "<p>Stocks have been boosted in recent sessions by better-than-expected quarterly results from large U.S. banks. A stream of upbeat reports from diverse companies Tuesday and Wednesday reinforced a sense that the business climate held up well through the third quarter.</p><p>\"The numbers coming through on the earnings are more positive than expectations. That's giving a short term momentum,\" said Niall O'Sullivan, chief investment officer of multiasset strategies at Neuberger Berman.</p><p>Still, inflation continues to scuttle investors' optimism, all but guaranteeing that interest rates will continue to rise around the world as global central banks struggle to cool the economy. The U.K. on Wednesday morning reported 10.1% inflation year over year for September, underscoring a difficult path ahead for the Bank of England as it also navigates a series of fiscal-policy reversals by the British government.</p><p>Canada's September annual inflation rate, likewise reported Wednesday, was 6.9%, slightly above what economists had forecast.</p><p>In morning trading, Procter &amp; Gamble shares added 2.4% after the consumer-goods company lowered its outlook for full-year sales but its quarterly earnings came in above Wall Street's estimates.</p><p>Netflix jumped 15% after it said it gained 2.4 million new subscribers last quarter, more than double the level it was expecting. United Airlines rose 6.6% after it said demand for air travel is resilient and that it expects a profit margin to rise beyond prepandemic levels by the end of the year.</p><p>Companies including Tesla and IBM are expected to report earnings after markets close.</p><p>Markets calming in the U.K. after a period of high volatility also contributed to broader sentiment. The BOE's recent bond-market intervention was taken as a sign that central banks can still act to stabilize markets in times of crisis, despite high inflation, investors said.</p><p>Oil prices edged up, with global crude benchmark Brent climbing 0.6% to trade at $90.61 a barrel. Traders are weighing the potential impact of the Biden administration planning to sell more oil from strategic reserves with the aim of lowering prices.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.096% from 3.996% the day before. Yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 slid 0.2%. Dutch semiconductor firm ASML Holding climbed 5.1% after reporting a narrower drop in profit last quarter, driven by record bookings.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks retreated. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 2.4%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Decline as Earnings, Global Inflation Figures Roll In</p>",
