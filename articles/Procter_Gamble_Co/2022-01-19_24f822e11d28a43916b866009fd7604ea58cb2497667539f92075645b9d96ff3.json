  "text": "<p>Microsoft yesterday unveiled its biggest acquisition under chief executive Satya Nadella, taking a huge gamble on the immersive future of the internet and the video game industry.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3726a3a-c4a0-4761-a82c-cda98abc3cb7\">purchase of Activision Blizzard</a> for $75bn will make the X-box maker the third-biggest gaming company by revenues after China's Tencent and Japan's Sony. It adds <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>World of Warcraft </em>and<em> Candy Crush </em>to Microsoft's digital entertainment business.</p> <p>It also moves Microsoft closer to Nadella's vision of an integrated platform for video game distribution. He has previously suggested that Microsoft could become a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b96246ec-e70e-48b6-9a70-fb0800f79bd8\">“Netflix for gaming”</a> — a single, subscription-based online service giving access to a wide array of exclusive content.</p> <p>But the deal is not without risks. Activision has faced <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3aa83d4-4c00-40b3-ae53-d9c9bed5a361\">allegations of widespread sexual harassment</a>. Bobby Kotick, Activision Blizzard's chief executive, has been under pressure to tackle a “pervasive ‘frat boy' workplace culture” at the Santa Monica-based company.</p> <p>Kotick, one of the highest paid executives in the US, is unlikely to remain with the company once the deal is completed. Microsoft said yesterday its head of gaming would have responsibility for the business once the deal was approved.</p> <p>The announcement sent shockwaves through the video games industry. Sony shares suffered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acb50daf-0fb2-4f51-8b25-c501488fb6fa\">their biggest fall since the start of the pandemic</a> earlier today in Asian trading. Other gaming companies, however, saw their shares rise on the prospect of more dealmaking in the sector. Shares in Electronic Arts, whose titles include the&#xa0;<em>Fifa</em>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<em>Madden</em>&#xa0;sports franchises, rose more than 5 per cent, while Ubisoft, maker of&#xa0;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>, rose 8 per cent.</p> <p><em>Do you back Nadella's bet?

BofA is expected to report stronger earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter, while forecasts show Morgan Stanley's bottom line probably came under pressure from a decline in trading income. Procter &amp; Gamble, the company behind big consumer brands such as Tide detergent and Crest toothpaste, will also release earnings before markets open. After the bell it is the turn of United Airlines.</p> <p><strong>Economic data</strong> A report from the Census Bureau is likely to show that the construction of new homes in the US slowed in December, economists predict. Supply chain delays and inflation, particularly for the cost of lumber, are adding weeks to construction times for single-family residences, the National Association of Home Builders said on Tuesday. </p> <p><strong>Covid tests</strong>: The Biden administration <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f12f0ae-7df4-4a0e-ab24-52bf9b378d6e#post-a2c8bbf0-7372-4cee-a6a2-9f1fbb590a19\">will officially launch a website</a> where Americans can order free at-home Covid tests delivered by the US Postal Service. The move comes after the White House faced criticism over a test shortage over the holidays as the Omicron coronavirus variant fuelled a rise in cases.</p> <p><strong>Ukraine tensions </strong>Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/833d3784-57cf-46a4-ade2-8d4ab2a3bae2\">meets</a> Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv ahead of a visit to Berlin on Thursday and a reported meeting with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday as diplomatic efforts to ease tensions between Moscow and the west continue. Meanwhile, Iran's president is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66b4b395-2b16-4689-bbb1-281dd172ec2a\">to fly to Moscow</a> for a meeting with Vladimir Putin.</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Blackstone's new real estate play</strong> Rent-to-buy companies are hot property in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street. By far the biggest is Home Partners of America which was bought by Blackstone for $6bn last year. Home Partners presents itself in altruistic terms as a new path for ordinary Americans to become homeowners. Yet <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2267d715-6ff9-428e-959a-f0e379e581e9\">a Financial Times investigation</a> suggests a more complicated reality.</p> <p><strong>Business leaders must play a better political role</strong> The western world confronts two great crises: a collapse in trust in our democratic political systems and a planetary environmental threat. Increased trust in governments suggests that state-driven solutions to these problems have at the very least a chance. But it is unclear, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b844f8b-4906-46b4-81e5-059a4d8d4eb6\">writes&#xa0;Martin Wolf</a>,&#xa0; where business comes in. </p> <p><strong>Moscow's sanctions-proofing efforts weaken western threats&#xa0;</strong>Moscow's “Fortress Russia”&#xa0;strategy is&#xa0;likely to make US and Europe's proposed sanctions&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-a2eaba73-cec8-4a0f-b991-7de558bb0ee1/LsrqwGLxuiXqVEoI2L4GnA~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRjyckdP0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvYTJlYWJhNzMtY2VjOC00YTBmLWI5OTEtN2RlNTU4YmIwZWUxP2VtYWlsSWQ9NjFlNzM5MmFmZjA0ZTEwMDA0OTk3M2ZmJnNlZ21lbnRJZD02MGExMjZlOC1kZjNjLWI1MjQtYzk3OS1mOTBiZGU4YTY3Y2RXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgph30ZE52Exu1hnUhNnb3Jkb24uc21pdGhAZnQuY29tWAQAAAAA\">less of a deterrent from invading Ukraine</a>. However, the EU has not reduced its dependency on Russian gas, leaving the possibility for Moscow to retaliate by limiting supplies.</p> <p><strong>What we know about Evergrande's ‘black-box' restructuring </strong>The crisis at Evergrande, the world's most indebted property company, reached a milestone in December when it officially defaulted after months of missing payment deadlines. But the rest of the saga <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df906d88-26e9-4dcf-9cf2-820edace202a\">could take years to unfold</a>.</p> <h1>Books</h1> <p>Now that the headlines from last year's COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow have faded, you might think attention to planetary havoc has drifted. Not so in the publishing world, where 2022 has begun with an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0567c5fd-6464-4137-9401-15f787214bf8\">absorbing crop of environmental books</a> on everything from the polar vortex to veganism and, of course, global warming.</p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, William Langley and Angelica Crisostomo 2022 'FirstFT: Microsoft makes huge gamble on video game industry' FT.com 19 January.
