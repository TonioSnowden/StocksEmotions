  "title": "GSK/Dave Lewis: heavyweight adds heft to consumer health demerger",
  "text": "<p>More laughs, less pain, goes the marketing slogan for a GSK analgesic. The UK pharma group's embattled&#xa0;chief executive Emma Walmsley could doubtless&#xa0;benefit from a similar prescription. But despite attacks from US activist investor Elliott, GSK is standing its ground. The latest sign is Monday's announcement that ex-Tesco boss Sir Dave “Drastic” Lewis will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b86c4b0a-3e05-4303-80ff-880778ceb15d\">chair</a> the consumer health division.</p> <p>Lewis, a Unilever veteran who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be55674a-6273-11ea-abcc-910c5b38d9ed\">turned round</a> Tesco, is a heavyweight. His appointment draws attention to the scale of the business, likely to be one of the largest 20 companies in the FTSE when it lists in London next year. &#xa0; It has bulked up in recent years. After deals with Novartis and Pfizer, sales have grown&#xa0;by two-thirds since 2015. </p> <p>Elliott&#xa0;supports GSK's “wise” decision to separate the consumer health business. But it urged it to consider&#xa0;selling, rather than spinning off, the division. That looks increasingly unlikely, Many of GSK's biggest&#xa0;investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95ba1ca6-935f-4a15-80a6-fe2542744535\">support</a> the demerger plan. &#xa0;</p> <p>Elliott argued that the synergies from a corporate deal could be as high as 40 per cent of ebitda. But even without that, there is scope for margins to grow further. Operating profit margins, which doubled to 22 per cent from 2015 are predicted to rise to mid- to high-20s.&#xa0;That is a measure of potential cost savings and the market-leading position of many of the division's brands. </p> <p>Valuing the business is complicated by the absence of pure-play consumer health companies on the market. But its growth potential is similar to consumer companies such as P&amp;G and Reckitt Benckiser, though it will have&#xa0;heavier borrowings, with a debt-to-ebitda ratio as high as 4. Assume, then, an EV/ebtida multiple of about 16. That suggests a valuation of about £45bn, putting a price tag of £30bn on GSK's 68 per cent stake.</p> <p>A hope — which GSK and Elliott share — is that consumer-focused investors and analysts will put a higher valuation on the business than pharma experts currently do. Sir Dave's reputation makes that more likely.</p><p>Source:  2021 'GSK/Dave Lewis: heavyweight adds heft to consumer health demerger' FT.com 20 December.
