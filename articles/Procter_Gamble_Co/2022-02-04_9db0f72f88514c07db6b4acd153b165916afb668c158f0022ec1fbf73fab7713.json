  "text": "<p>Carlsberg plans to raise its beer prices this year to deal with steeply rising costs, a measure that it warned was likely to hit beer sales as it becomes the latest company to pass inflation on to consumers.</p> <p>The Danish brewer, which owns brands including Tuborg and Kronenbourg 1664, said sales last year had exceeded pre-pandemic levels, but that it expected cost inflation and the ongoing effects of Covid-19 to weigh on its business in 2022.</p> <p>Cees ‘t Hart, chief executive, in a statement on Friday said cost rises were “very significant. Our ambition is to offset this cost through higher revenue per hectolitre but of course there is still some uncertainty. </p> <p>“Many customer negotiations are not yet concluded, we don't know our competitors' reactions and it's uncertain how the rise in inflation will impact consumers . . . These are significant headwinds.”</p> <p>The world's third-largest brewer warned that the price rises “may have a negative impact on beer consumption”.</p> <p>Carlsberg in the past advertised its beer as “probably” the best in the world. It is the latest drinks company to signal the effects of steep inflation in commodity prices and transport. US-based Constellation Brands last month said it would increase prices for its brands, which include Corona and Modelo, by more than the normal 1 to 2 per cent this year. Carlsberg's larger rivals Heineken and Anheuser-Busch InBev are due to report full-year results this month.</p> <p>Food and household products makers have issued similar warnings: Procter &amp; Gamble, for example, last month announced fresh price rises on its products to take effect at the end of February.</p> <p>Carlsberg said it expected costs per hectolitre of beer to rise 10 to 12 per cent, an increase it aimed to pass on to consumers in full through higher prices and changes to the mix of products sold. </p> <p>The brewer was negotiating with retailers and hospitality venues, ‘t Hart said. “We are cautiously optimistic that we can conclude agreements that will be mutually beneficial,” he added.</p> <p>The company could more easily push up prices on premium brands, where customers are less price-sensitive, he added, while the return to socialising after the worst of the pandemic would benefit the group.</p> <p>“There's a situation we have never experienced. For two years people were more or less at home, but now they can go out, but it's a bit more expensive . . . it's difficult to foresee how this will pan out,” he said.</p> <p>The group reported organic revenue growth of 10 per cent in 2021 and organic operating profit growth of 12.5 per cent, prompting the board to propose a dividend increase of 9 per cent to DKr24 per share. It forecast organic operating profit growth of zero to 7 per cent for 2022, however.</p> <p>The warning on costs came after Carlsberg set out a growth strategy that focuses on premium brands and so-called super premium lines such as 1664 Blanc, along with alcohol-free beer — which it said was one of the fastest-growing categories — and non-beer brands such as Somersby cider and Garage Hard Lemonade.</p> <p>Non-alcoholic beer accounts for 4 to 5 per cent of Carlsberg's sales and it expects to double that in five years, ‘t Hart said.</p> <p>Shares in the group rose 2.2 per cent on Friday morning to DKr1,088.</p><p>Source: Judith Evans 2022 'Carlsberg warns sales will probably suffer as prices rise to offset growing costs ' FT.com 4 February.
