  "title": "P&G Rides Higher Prices but Says Strong Dollar to Slow Growth; Maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors now predicts a sales decline for its fiscal year",
  "text": "<p>Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said the stronger U.S. dollar erased most of its sales gains for the latest quarter and is on track to lead the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors to its first annual sales decline in half a decade.</p><p>The Cincinnati-based consumer-products company on Wednesday lowered its annual revenue guidance, citing the run-up in the value of the dollar relative to other currencies around the world. P&amp;G now expects sales for the fiscal year ending June 30 to fall 1% to 3%; its previous forecast called for growth between flat and 2%.</p><p>\"Those headwinds will probably continue,\" P&amp;G finance chief, Andre Schulten, said. \"It doesn't fundamentally change anything about our strategy. If anything it reaffirms our choice in categories we operate in.\"</p><p>P&amp;G's results for the September quarter were better than Wall Street expected as price increase offset declining volumes. P&amp;G shares were up 3.4% in morning trading. The company's share price is down about 6.7% from a year ago, compared with a 17% decline for the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>P&amp;G expects unfavorable foreign-exchange rates to cost the company $1.3 billion for the fiscal year, while higher commodity, materials and freight costs would be a $2.6 billion drag. It expects currency movements to be a 6% hit to sales growth, double the previous estimate.</p><p>P&amp;G over the years has largely shifted to local sourcing throughout its global supply chain, which mitigates effects of currency fluctuations, but the company remains susceptible to the impact of the strong dollar on commodity pricing and global consumer spending.</p><p>The company plans to return to pre-Covid levels of cost-cutting, trimming expenses such as marketing spending and overtime, Mr. Schulten said, but isn't planning a substantial head-count reduction after adding thousands of employees to keep up with demand during the pandemic.</p><p>The company said organic sales, a closely watched metric that strips out currency moves and deals, grew 7% in the quarter ended Sept. 30 as Americans absorbed substantial price increases in products from detergent to diapers. Sales volumes fell 3% globally. P&amp;G attributed two-thirds of the decline to a decision to halt sales of most products in Russia amid the war in Ukraine.</p><p>The world's biggest consumer companies this year have reported sales gains on the back of higher prices, and this summer said they would keep passing on higher costs to consumers.</p><p>Also on Wednesday, Nestl√© SA, the world's largest packaged-foods maker, said higher selling prices on products from KitKat chocolate to Perrier water, drove a surge in revenue. Organic sales growth was 8.5% in the first nine months of 2022, consisting of price increases of 7.5% and a 1% rise in volumes. Price increases were particularly steep in North America, up 11.1%.</p><p>P&amp;G's Mr. Schulten said consumers' willingness and ability to pay ever more for staples is coming to an end, and P&amp;G predicts organic sales will be substantially lower for the remainder of the fiscal year as it slows the pace of price increases. Executives said discounts and deals are returning to pre-Covid levels after dropping sharply amid the pandemic, when many household staples were in short supply.</p><p>\"It's a very dynamic environment, we will continue to carefully balance innovation, pricing, and productivity,\" Mr. Schulten said.</p><p>U.S. consumer inflation excluding energy and food reached a four-decade high in September.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's your outlook on P&amp;G? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Mr. Schulten said retailers also are stocking up less following more than two years of sometimes-severe product shortages amid the Covid-19 pandemic and global supply-chain meltdown. Retailer inventory levels are back to where they were before the pandemic, he said.</p><p>P&amp;G has seen its market share decline broadly and in some key categories in recent months. Mr. Schulten said that is largely due to the fact that P&amp;G sales were inflated a year ago amid heightened pandemic demand and other factors, and that the company is seeing its market position improve monthly.</p><p>The company reported $20.6 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 1% from a year earlier. Diluted net earnings per share were $1.57, down 2% but higher than the consensus analyst estimate of $1.53 a share, according to FactSet.</p><p>Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com</p><p>P&amp;G Rides Higher Prices but Says Strong Dollar to Slow Growth</p>",
