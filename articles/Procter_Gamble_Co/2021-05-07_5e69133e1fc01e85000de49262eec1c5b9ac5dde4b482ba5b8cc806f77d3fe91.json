  "title": "Best of Lex: a trippy-dippy week",
  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>Nothing quite kicks off the week like a dose of magic mushrooms. Lex used bank holiday Monday to tune into psychedelic stocks and proceeded to track the week's highs, including Darktrace's rocketing debut.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Mind-altering drugs, shaking off their trippy days, are being corralled for treating mental disorders. The nascent market, while still controversial, is gaining ballast. Listed psychedelic companies, which include Canada's Cybin and Numinus Wellness, boast an aggregate market value of more than $3.5bn. Now Atai Life Sciences, backed by tech investor Peter Thiel, is plotting an initial public offering.</p> <p>Lex has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad6d8238-831b-4de2-bda6-ef3cd784a85d\">high hopes for the field</a>. London-based Compass Pathways, another Thiel protégé, joined Nasdaq last September. Its formulation of synthetic psilocybin, the psychedelic ingredient found in magic mushrooms, has been designated a breakthrough therapy in the US. A small UK trial found it was at least as effective as a leading antidepressant drug; Berenberg is forecasting peak sales of more than $2.5bn.</p> <p>Operating in this niche means backlashes are a risk but ballooning demand for treatments in the mental health sphere suggest this could be a big market.</p> <p>Demand was also a pleasant discovery for Darktrace which, spooked perhaps by Deliveroo's ghastly float, hacked back its IPO price. That was enough to draw investors. Underwriter Jefferies then exercised overallotment <a href=\"https://ir.darktrace.com/regulatory-news\">options</a>. </p> <p>Lex reckons mechanisms designed to stabilise prices will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19daeb26-5110-4497-a746-faf1022dd700\">stay in vogue for some time</a> to come thanks to the unpredictable nature of the IPO process. An industry less attached to tradition would create an online auction system with surer outcomes.</p> <p>One industry with scant time for tradition is the growing world of electric vehicles, led by Tesla but followed by a veritable traffic jam of players new (China's Nio and XPeng) and old (Japan's Nissan and Toyota).</p> <p>This opens two routes for investors: charging point operators and equipment manufacturers. Drivers need fast charging, which relies on capex-intensive infrastructure building.</p> <p>Dutch company Fastned, doing just that, expects 170 stations to be operational this year. Its shares, up fivefold over the past year, trade at 74 times this year's expected revenues. Equipment manufacturers such as Norway's Zaptec and ChargePoint of the US, are only a bit less toppy. But, says Lex, there is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac686ed3-50f5-4c39-95f8-b4389a651d60\">plenty of vroom</a> left in the sector.</p> <p>Back in the financial world, mergers continue to absorb southern Europe. In Spain, the soon-to-be conjoined Unicaja and Liberbank operate against a backdrop of rising unemployment and squeezed net interest margins. That leaves <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6622257e-c6cb-4781-9272-1a5051f2e49f\">a lot riding on their integration</a>, which aims to cut a swath of costs and generate returns on capital of 6 per cent by 2023. Ambitious, reckons Lex.</p> <p>In Italy, <em>naturalmente</em>, more drama.&#xa0;Andrea Orcel, newly minted boss of UniCredit, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf623725-8240-46fe-a083-62b238a48545\">faces a dilemma</a>. The government wants him to take on struggling lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena. Shareholders want him to reject any deal that would damage their equity.</p> <p>Orcel's predecessor was ousted after refusing to take over MPS. The appeal for the government is clear. UniCredit has €14bn of surplus core equity tier one capital over its target level, Lex calculates. MPS needs an injection of more than €2bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>The risk of being called upon to perform national service is one reason why UniCredit's shares trade at a lowly 0.3 times tangible book value, far below Intesa Sanpaolo's healthier 0.8 times. But earnings are also weaker. Time, says Lex, for Orcel to show he can do better.</p> <p>Another financial institution in a pickle is BlackRock. The US passive specialist is discovering that you can't have your cookie — or anything else containing ubiquitous palm oil — and eat it. BlackRock is a top three investor in Indonesia's Astra International, a palm oil subsidiary of which has come <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/479b9dd2-c738-4310-8b1e-afdfbd3921b0\">under attack</a> from environmentalists for its alleged seizure of land from local farmers.</p> <p>That claim is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3427fd3-34e0-44fd-b1cc-7a19d907470f\">awkward for BlackRock</a>, which participated last year in a shareholder revolt over Procter &amp; Gamble's sourcing of palm oil. Yet disinvesting from Astra would be harder for BlackRock as a primarily passive manager. The dilemma is not new. Old guard ethical investors, notably the Church of England with a history of investing in industries it condemned, know it well. It is, after all, easier to claim virtue than to preserve it.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Wishing you a restful weekend.</p> <p><strong>Louise Lucas</strong><br><em>Lex writer</em> </p> <h2>Best of Lex articles</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad6d8238-831b-4de2-bda6-ef3cd784a85d\">Mental health/psychedelic drugs: mushrooming investor interest fuels research</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19daeb26-5110-4497-a746-faf1022dd700\">Darktrace/IPOs: shoes for every occasion</a> <br><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac686ed3-50f5-4c39-95f8-b4389a651d60\">Electric vehicles: charging shares are starting to buzz</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6622257e-c6cb-4781-9272-1a5051f2e49f\">Unicaja/Liberbank: Spanish bank consolidation yet to be tested</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf623725-8240-46fe-a083-62b238a48545\">UniCredit/Andrea Orcel: MPS deal presents high flyer with a dilemma</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3427fd3-34e0-44fd-b1cc-7a19d907470f\">Palm oil/BlackRock: passive strategy is at odds with ESG stance </a><br></p><p>Source: Louise Lucas 2021 'Best of Lex: a trippy-dippy week' FT.com 7 May.
