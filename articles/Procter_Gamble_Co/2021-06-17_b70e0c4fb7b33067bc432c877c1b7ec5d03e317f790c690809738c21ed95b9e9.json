  "text": "<p>Actress Jessica Alba brought Hollywood glamour to Wall Street last month when Honest, the baby products start-up she co-founded, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29f077fb-82fc-4890-8480-1d5889eb4dcf\">went public</a>. But the Los Angeles-based company, which makes nappies and wipes marketed as eco-friendly, will need more than star power to sustain its earlier revenue growth. More babies would help.</p> <p>Since their debut, shares in Honest have given up most of their gains, trading near their $16 IPO price. Investors are right to be sceptical. Birth rates in the US have declined as would-be parents delay having kids. The pandemic has failed to reverse this trend. The baby boom that some predicted never materialised. Total births dropped to a 42-year low of <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/technical-notes-outcomes.htm\">3.6m last year</a>, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p> <p>This presents a challenge for Honest, for which nappies and wipes accounted for <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001530979/000119312521111539/d27841ds1.htm\">63 per cent</a> of last year's $300m of revenue. Hoarding and panic buying helped the company deliver 28 per cent growth in sales in 2020. But that starburst has faded as its <a href=\"https://investors.honest.com/node/6971/pdf\">first-quarter results</a> revealed.&#xa0;</p> <p>Falling birth rates hurts all nappy makers. But Honest looks more vulnerable than established giants Kimberly-Clark and Procter &amp; Gamble. Smaller and less diversified Honest has little exposure to emerging markets. Cutting prices will not help as Honest already loses money.</p> <p>Diversification offers some hope. Honest's shift into cleaning products and beauty products makes up for the slowdown in nappy sales for now. Both units posted impressive growth during the first quarter. Yet, a small base of sales makes this look better than it is.</p> <p>To its credit, Honest has admirably recovered from the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a774075d-239c-4c44-8af9-1b412460a957\">product scandals</a> four years ago that resulted in a sales slide and the loss of its unicorn status. But with the stock trading at an enterprise value to forward sales ratio of five times it does not offer the safety of a cheap valuation. Kimberly-Clark is on only 2.5 times while P&amp;G is closer to 4 times.
