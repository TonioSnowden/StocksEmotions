  "title": "Nestlé Escapes Netflix's Fate for Now; Strong sales show that shoppers aren't cutting back on food, unlike more discretionary purchases such as streaming subscriptions and fashion",
  "text": "<p>Stronger-than-expected volumes were reported by other companies that make essential consumer goods this week. Procter &amp; Gamble's volumes increased by 3%, even though it charged 5% more. Evian bottled-water supplier Danone sold more goods despite raising its prices. Spending on beer has also been resilient, according to results from Heineken, the world's second-largest brewer, which shifted 5.2% more beer in its latest quarter than a year earlier.</p><p>There are signs that more discretionary consumer goods like streaming services are coming under pressure. Netflix lost more than one-third of its value Wednesday after reporting its first fall in paid subscribers in over a decade. Intense competition between streaming platforms was a factor, but users may also be trying to reduce their outgoings.</p><p>In the U.S., spending on fast-fashion brands has slowed compared with this time last year, as low-income consumers feel more pinched, according to a Bank of America analysis of credit-card data. This coincides with sharp falls in the number of U.S. cigarettes sold. Smokers tend to have lower-than-average incomes and are especially sensitive to gasoline prices, which currently stand above $4 a gallon.</p><p>Companies that make essential household goods may not always be spared. They need to raise prices again soon: The war in Ukraine has pushed up the cost of energy, which will feed through to plastic prices. This hurts consumer-staples companies, which tend to be heavy users of packaging.</p><p>Costlier agricultural grains will also fuel inflation in ingredients for savory snacks, as will rising milk and meat prices as it becomes more expensive to feed livestock. Shortages of sunflower oil—an ingredient in many baby food brands that is normally exported by Ukraine—will hurt Nestlé and Danone as strict regulations for infant formula recipes make it hard to substitute the input with, say, palm oil.</p><p>If brands are too aggressive with price increases, more consumers could trade down to cheaper equivalent products such as supermarket labels, damaging the volume growth on which the health of packaged-goods companies ultimately depends. For now, though, consumers seem focused on saving money elsewhere, and consumer-staples companies are living up to their defensive reputation.</p><p>Write to Carol Ryan at carol.ryan@wsj.com</p><p>Nestlé Escapes Netflix's Fate for Now</p>",
