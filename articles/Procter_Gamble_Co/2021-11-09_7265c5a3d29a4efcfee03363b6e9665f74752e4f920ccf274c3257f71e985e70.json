  "title": "How Marketers Can Prepare for Unexpected Controversies; Marketers are diverging in their handling of dust-ups like the one around Aaron Rodgers and his vaccine comments",
  "text": "<p>The issue is not new. It came to the fore as well for marketers in the wake of a sex scandal involving golfer Tiger Woods more than a decade ago. In 2009, multiple women said they had had affairs with him. Following the allegations, Mr. Woods said he would take a break from golf indefinitely.</p><p>AT&amp;T Inc., PepsiCo Inc.'s Gatorade and Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s Gillette dropped Mr. Woods. Sportswear retailer Nike Inc., though, opted to stick by him.</p><p>More recently, major brands were frequently pulled into political fights related to then-President Donald Trump.</p><p>Companies should determine where they stand on major issues, such as inclusion, sustainability and vaccinations, before they need to confront them, said Richard Edelman, CEO of communications firm Edelman.</p><p>While companies don't need to come out and proactively announce stances on everything, they do need to be able to explain their actions to customers and employees, Mr. Edelman said. That can serve as a north star of sorts if they are pulled into controversy.</p><p>\"As a business, we have a choice of ducking or not ducking,\" Mr. Edelman said. \"I don't think ducking is something that is viable. You have to at least explain why you're doing what you're doing. To put your head down is not an option.\"</p><p>The episode around Mr. Rodgers began with the disclosure that he had tested positive for Covid-19, despite publicly stating he had been immunized. Controversy grew after the Green Bay Packers quarterback questioned the effectiveness of vaccines.</p><p>Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective at preventing severe illness while reducing transmission and spread.</p><p>\"We don't support some of the statements that he has made, but we respect his right to have his own personal point of view,\" a spokeswoman for State Farm said in a statement.</p><p>As State Farm discovered with the dust-up over Mr. Rodgers, with critics of brands able to quickly amplify one another on social media, marketers regularly face sudden, unexpected dilemmas about how or if to respond when they are suddenly mired in controversy, whether due to the actions of a spokesman or otherwise.</p><p>Marketers often must choose if they will forge ahead with a campaign, pause it or drop it altogether.</p><p>Healthcare provider Prevea said in a statement that it is committed to protecting patients and staff, including through helping eligible populations become vaccinated against Covid-19.</p><p>Brands today have to understand the pressure on celebrities to take political and social positions, said Doug Shabelman, CEO at Burns Entertainment, a company that matches celebrities with corporations for endorsements and other opportunities.</p><p>\"If you look at what's happened with politics in the last six years, I'm constantly advising our clients, you have to realize that these celebrities now are not going to sit back idly by and not take a stance in some respect,\" Mr. Shabelman said, noting that some celebrities are more outspoken, while others tend to stay silent on such issues. Any stance celebrities take \"will be dissected, it will be commented on.\"</p><p>Smart marketers think about these issues in advance and consider their plans if a celebrity does end up making a comment that could turn customers off, Mr. Shabelman added.</p><p>Companies also have to grapple with whether online feedback actually reflects the sentiment of their customers. Jeremy Mullman, a partner at marketing agency ICF Next who leads the firm's commercial media-relations practice, said feedback can seem overwhelming to a brand on social media but might only represent a small part of the conversation.</p><p>\"It's always good to use whatever tools you have to get a sense of the size of the conversation you're dealing with, and also who's actually talking about it, so you're making decisions in a clear-eyed way and not just reacting to the loudest voice,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Megan Graham at megan.graham@wsj.com</p><p>How Marketers Can Prepare for Unexpected Controversies</p>",
