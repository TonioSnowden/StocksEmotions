  "title": "Activist  Peltz Buys  Stake in  Unilever  ----  By Cara Lombardo, Saabira Chaudhuri and Costas Paris",
  "text": "<p>   LONDON -- Trian Fund Management LP, the activist hedge fund run by Nelson Peltz, has acquired a stake in Unilever PLC, said people familiar with the matter, adding pressure to the packaged-food and consumer-goods maker after its failed $68 billion bid for GlaxoSmithKline PLC's consumer-health business. </p><p>   The size of the stake couldn't be learned.Trian started buying Unilever shares well before its bids for the GSK unit surfaced this month, one of the people said. </p><p>   Unilever's shares have been under pressure in recent months as it has struggled to boost volumes. Analysts say it has underperformed some rivals during the Covid-19 pandemic in areas such as hygiene and packaged foods and hasn't launched any blockbuster innovations in some time. </p><p>   The company faced opposition from investors to its plan to buy the GSK healthcare business, with analysts pointing to its mixed record on several other big acquisitions. Critics said the London-based company would be overpaying for the GSK business and that it should focus on turning around its existing categories rather than taking on new ones in which it had little experience. </p><p>   Trian's stake in Unilever was earlier reported by the Financial Times. </p><p>   Unilever Chief Executive Alan Jope late last year kicked off the effort to buy the consumer-health business that GSK has said it is preparing to spin off. Unilever said the deal would be part of an effort to push further into health, beauty and hygiene products, at the expense of slower-growing food brands. The bid and the pivot to health amounted to Unilever's biggest strategic shift in years. It said at the time that any big acquisitions would likely be accompanied by significant divestitures. </p><p>   But the effort faltered amid intense opposition from Unilever shareholders, while GSK held out for a better price. Mr. Jope last week said he wouldn't raise Unilever's last offer, essentially putting the deal on ice. Unilever said it was committed to improving the performance of its existing brands, including through a coming reorganization, and rotating its portfolio into higher-growth categories. </p><p>   Some analysts and investors say Mr. Jope's credibility has taken a hit from the episode. </p><p>   Trian's stake comes a few years after the New York firm bought into Unilever rival Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Mr. Peltz in 2017 narrowly won a P&amp;G board seat, in what was at the time the most expensive proxy fight in U.S. history. </p><p>   Mr. Peltz previously has served on the boards of other consumer-goods companies, including Oreos maker Mondelez International Inc. and H.J. Heinz Co. In some past activist campaigns, he has sought to break up companies, though that wasn't a goal in his P&amp;G involvement. </p><p>   Analysts and investors have called for Unilever to jump-start its own sales growth in a way similar to P&amp;G's turnaround, including by divesting itself of slower-growing brands and turning around its core business. </p><p>   Unilever's misjudgment over investor opposition to the GSK bid has drawn parallels with its miscalculation in 2018 of shareholder support for the Anglo-Dutch company's bid to consolidate its headquarters in Rotterdam. The company, which had operated joint head offices there and in London, made a U-turn on its decision after fierce opposition. Shortly after, then-CEO Paul Polman stepped down, turning the reins over to Mr. Jope. </p><p></p>",
