  "text": "<p>Is it better to be a shareholder or a consumer when food prices rise? Nestlé is splitting the inflationary KitKat in favour of investors, judging from last quarter's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/125e6907-2e35-4197-84a2-784f080dc758\">results</a>. The Swiss food giant is not the only consumer products group passing on higher pricing. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2205d57f-c20a-46b0-995a-409a4e25ccbd\">Procter &amp; Gamble</a>, L'Oréal, Danone and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/feddc32b-99e2-4af1-ab86-e65516710a3a#post-302d10aa-1d46-4d1f-a320-98d15e97686b\">Heineken</a> all managed to charge more for diapers, beer and the like in the latest quarter. </p> <p>The lesson of past inflationary spirals is the longer they last, the harder it becomes for companies to sidestep cost hikes.</p> <p>Nestlé <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/125e6907-2e35-4197-84a2-784f080dc758\">increased</a> pricing by 5.2 per cent year on year. In the US, the increase was a whopping 8.5 per cent. That enables the world's largest foods business to stick with guidance on underlying trading operating profit margins. These will be 17-17.5 per cent, in line with last year, bucking the more usual trend of margin expansion.</p> <p>Demand for staples is by definition inelastic. Only a tenth or so of household spending in developed markets — <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/family-food-201920\">15 per cent </a>for lower income British households — goes on food. In the US, wage inflation easily has increases covered.</p> <p>Nestlé should be able to keep raising sticker prices. Its portfolio is packed with premium products. The average Nespresso drinker can easily stomach inflated price tags. Commoditised comestibles like bottled water, yoghurt or tea bags are more prone to substitution with cheaper versions. </p> <p>Portfolio mix is one reason France's Danone and UK-listed Unilever, due to report next week, will find the going tougher than Nestlé if inflation remains high. Unilever, whose pantry staples include Knorr stock and Hellmann's mayo, calculates that increased ingredient prices and shipping costs will add €3.6bn to its €23bn input bill. Despite pushing through some of that, it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/859468f2-9473-4d42-aba6-24700914f5a8\">expects</a> operating margins to contract as much as 240 basis points this year, to 16-17 per cent. </p> <p>Focus is another differentiator. Nestlé and P&amp;G have both pulled off turnrounds; Danone and Unilever are slap bang in the middle of their own. The former has a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4f4475e-16f6-494c-9b4c-45e639871b0d\">new boss</a>; the latter has to win round investors after launching an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30070969-71bc-4ef9-a035-45d589b6fefe\">ill-fated £50bn bid</a> for GSK's consumer division.</p> <p>Neither camp is guaranteed a clear run. Passing on costs means keeping retailers on side. European retailers have more concentrated power than peers in the fragmented US market. Sustained inflation will change shopping habits. </p> <p>Most businesses claim to have defensive qualities when conditions start deteriorating. Usually, they are whistling in the dark.</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers. How easily can food groups pass on inflation?
