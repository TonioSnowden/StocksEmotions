The S&amp;P 500's consumer-staples and consumer-discretionary sectors on Wednesday booked their biggest percentage drop since March 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>\"We're in a bear-market move,\" with sharp relief rallies presenting \"better selling opportunities until you get a long-term bottom,\" said Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, in a phone interview. \"My indicators suggest that the bear-market move can keep its hold through the summer months.\"</p><p>Stockton is the portfolio manager for the recently launched Fairlead Tactical Sector ETF TACK, an active U.S. equity fund that uses a systematic strategy and is rebalanced monthly. The fund, which began trading March 23, is so far faring better than the S&amp;P 500 index.</p><p>Shares of the Fairlead Tactical Sector ETF are down 1.8% this month through Wednesday, after falling 3.3% in April, FactSet data show. That compares with the S&amp;P 500's 8.8% drop last month and a decline of 5% in May through Wednesday.</p><p>\"Over the course of the fund's life, it's gotten increasingly risk off,\" said Stockton, partly through a more defensive sector positioning that includes exposure to consumer staples. She said the ETF can help \"protect downside in this type of environment\" where stocks are selling off.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 was trading down Thursday afternoon, nearing bear market territory, which it would enter with a close of about 3,837, according to Dow Jones Market data.</p><p>The Fairlead Tactical Sector ETF, which invests in SPDR ETFs, has shifted to a 50% position in short-term Treasuries SPTS, long-term Treasuries SPTL and gold GLD, Stockton said, while the fund's sectors exposures are \"fairly defensive,\" including consumer staples XLP, utilities XLU, real estate XLRE and energy XLE.</p><p>Consumer staples is considered a defensive sector but it has taken a beating this week, as earning misses reported by Target Corp. TGT and Walmart Inc. WMT have increased investors' recession fears amid concern that high inflation may be squeezing Americans' spending.</p><p>Read: Target stock plunges as profit drops on consumer spending shifts and jump in freight costs</p><p>The Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF VDC, Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF RHS and Fidelity Covington Trust MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF FSTA all fell more than 6% Wednesday, according to FactSet data.</p><p>Walmart, a retail giant in the S&amp;P 500 index's consumer-staples sector, is down around 19% this week, based on Thursday afternoon trading levels, FactSet data show, at last check. And Target, a department-store chain in the S&amp;P 500's battered consumer discretionary sector, has this week tanked around 30%, based on Thursday afternoon trading.</p><p>Read:  If you thought Walmart and Target had disappointing earnings, these retailers did so much worse</p><p>So far this year, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund has plunged 30% through Wednesday, far exceeding the nearly 7% decline for the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund over the same period, FactSet data show.</p><p>\"Inflation always hits the lower income cohorts hardest and first,\" according to a May 18 markets note from The Sevens Report. Walmart's earnings results \"imply that's starting to happen now,\" the report says, warning that \"a further economic slowdown\" risks weighing more broadly on the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund.</p><p>The Sevens Report suggested that Walmart's results \"somewhat refutes the 'defensive' nature of consumer staples, at least partially,\" while also pointing to the consumer shift that the retailer saw toward brand names instead of \"private label\" as a sign of inflation weighing on consumers.</p><p>Read: Walmart says consumers are trading down to private label for items like dairy and bacon</p><p>\"The shift from brand names to generic is a potential threat\" to Procter &amp; Gamble Co. PG, which is the biggest holding in the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP), according to the Stevens Report. \"We don't think it invalidates Consumer Staples as a defensive play, but it does imply an equal-weight ETF might be better than XLP to diversify the risk a bit more.\"</p><p>The Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF RHS \"equal weights the consumer staples in the S&amp;P 500, providing more diversification against changing consumer trends,\" according to the report. Shares of the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF are down around 3% this year through Wednesday, FactSet data show.</p><p>As usual, here's your weekly look at the top and bottom ETF performers over the past week through Wednesday, according to FactSet.</p><p>The good… </p><p> Best performers                                               %Performance  Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF PBW                       12  Invesco Solar ETF TAN                                         10.9  VanEck Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF REMX                   9.8  ALPS Clean Energy ETF ACES                                    9.1  First Trust Nasdaq Clean Edge Green Energy Index Fund QCLN    8.5</p><p>…the bad </p><p> Worst Performers                                                 %Performance  Xtrackers MSCI Kokusai Equity ETF KOKU                           -7.7  Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF VDC                                -5.4  Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF RHS            -5.3  Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund XLP                     -5.2  Fidelity Covington Trust MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF FSTA    -5.2</p><p>Source: FactSet, through Wednesday May 18, 2022 excluding ETNs and leveraged products.
