  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis: Nestle to Pare Russia Operations Amid Outcry",
  "text": "<p>Nestle said the only products it would continue to sell in Russia would be baby food and other infant-nutrition products, specialist veterinary meals and medical-nutrition products.</p><p>While Nestle had previously suspended imports and exports of products it deemed nonessential, such as Nespresso pods and San Pellegrino water, the company has kept all six of its Russian factories open to produce goods for local sale, including confectionery and coffee. About 90% of what Nestle sells in Russia is made there. It previously described its products as essential, saying it had a responsibility to its employees in the country.</p><p>Wednesday's announcement means Nestle will suspend the \"vast majority of our prewar volume\" in Russia, a spokesman said. \"We are in the process of identifying solutions for our people and our factories in Russia,\" he said. \"We will continue to pay our people.\" The company has about 7,000 workers in Russia.</p><p>While many of the world's largest makers of household staples, including Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Dove soap maker Unilever PLC, are continuing to sell food and other consumer products in Russia, Nestle has attracted particular scrutiny.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mentioned Nestle in several speeches when calling for Western businesses to pull out of Russia.</p><p>The company had also been criticized by Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, who tweeted that he had talked with Nestle Chief Executive Mark Schneider, who he said showed no understanding of the side effects of continuing to sell in Russia.</p><p>Several of Nestle's Ukraine-based employees -- it has about 5,000 -- have also voiced their dissatisfaction on social media with the company's response to the invasion.</p><p>Late last week, Nestle's Europe head, Marco Settembri, drew the ire of some employees during an internal webcast when he said the company's Ukrainian workers should be united with their Russian colleagues, participants said.</p><p>\"At this point I would say this is a crazy thing to say,\" said Sofia Vashchenko, who oversees a team working on web content for Nestle in Ukraine. \"People really, really started getting mad,\" she said.</p><p>A Nestle spokesman said Mr. Settembri had said \"let's try to stay united against the nonsense of war,\" addressing colleagues across Europe.</p>",
