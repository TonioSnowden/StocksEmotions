  "title": "Nestle Faces A Chilly Winter Back Home --- High energy bills set to pinch its shoppers",
  "text": "<p>The Swiss food company, which sells brands including Nescafe coffee and Purina pet food, reported its highest quarterly growth in 14 years on Wednesday and raised its full-year outlook. Sales increased by 9.3% at constant currencies for the three months through September compared with a year earlier.</p><p>Products that are consumed outside the house, like bottled water and confectionery, sold well. Demand for these goods fell during lockdowns last year but has bounced back as people return to more normal routines.</p><p>But all of Nestle's growth in the latest quarter came from charging more rather than selling in greater quantities. The company's brands are 9.5% pricier today than they were this time last year, on average. Even these increases won't fully offset the input cost inflation the company is experiencing. Management expects operating margins for the full year to be 17%, which is 0.6 percentage point lower than prepandemic levels.</p><p>The company faces a balancing act. Nudging prices up further could encourage shoppers to defect to cheaper brands. Nestle's real internal growth, a measure of both volumes and the mix of products sold, turned negative for the first time in at least a decade. This is mostly because the company sold an unusually large amount of goods during lockdowns last year. But shoppers are becoming sensitive to price rises in everyday products like dairy goods. More generic store brands are winning back some of the market share they lost during the pandemic, when consumers treated themselves to better-known food labels.</p><p>A big business in Europe, which generates around 20% of Nestle's overall sales, will make it harder to maintain the recent strong performance into 2023. European consumers haven't felt the full force of higher energy bills yet, but will find it more expensive to heat and power their homes this winter. Even factoring in recently announced government price caps, one-year forward electricity prices are around double their 2021 average in Europe and the U.K., Bank of America notes.</p><p>Sellers of discretionary goods like clothing usually suffer more than household-staples brands when shoppers have less money to spend. But European companies like Nestle and Unilever are more exposed to the region than U.S. peers Procter &amp; Gamble and Kraft Heinz.</p><p>Nestle appears to be treading carefully in the region: Price increases of 5.7% in Europe over the first nine months of this year are almost half the current rate of inflation in both the eurozone and U.K.</p><p>Nestle -- the largest constituent of the Stoxx Europe indexes -- proved to be a steady, reliable stock throughout the pandemic. Today, its shares trade at 21 times projected earnings, slightly below the five-year average of 23 times. That hints at value, but the European winter will be a stiff test of Nestle's defensive reputation.</p>",
