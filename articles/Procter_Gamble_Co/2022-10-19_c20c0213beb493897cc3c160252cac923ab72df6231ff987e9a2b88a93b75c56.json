  "text": "<p>Stocks have been boosted in recent sessions by better-than-expected quarterly results fromlarge U.S. banks. A stream of mostly upbeat reports from diverse companies Tuesday and Wednesday reinforced a sense that the business climate held up well in the third quarter.</p><p>\"The numbers coming through on the earnings are more positive than expectations. That's giving a short term momentum,\" said Niall O'Sullivan, chief investment officer of multiasset strategies at Neuberger Berman.</p><p>Still, inflation continues to scuttle investors' optimism, all but guaranteeing that interest rates will continue to rise around the world as global central banks struggle to cool the economy. The U.K. on Wednesday morningreported 10.1% inflation year over year for September, underscoring a difficult path ahead for the Bank of England as it also navigates a series of fiscal-policy reversals by the British government.</p><p>Canada's annual inflation rate, likewise reported Wednesday, was 6.9% in September, slightly above what economists had forecast.</p><p>The persistence of rising prices—which have consistently exceeded investors' expectations over the past year—makes strong earnings reports a double-edged sword.</p><p>United Airlines' forecast for rising profit margins and resilient travel demand, for example, lifted airline shares Wednesday but also indicated that the Fed's rate increases haven't yet done enough to cool consumer demand and business activity, said Brandon Pizzurro, director of public investment at GuideStone Capital Management.</p><p>He added earnings could sour broadly as higher rates bite.</p><p>\"I'm concerned that we're getting the very last amount of any good news out of a large majority of these companies,\" Mr. Pizzurro said. \"When the rate increases come home to roost, that's when the wrecking ball of what the Fed has done will be felt.\"</p><p>United shares rose 7%.</p><p>Signs that shoppers aren't ready to stop spending on dining, vacations and tech reinforce the case for more Fed interest-rate increases to come, which many investors think could cause a serious recession in the next year. Inflation reduces the central bank's perceived leeway to shift gears and ease policy again to cushion the economy when it slows.</p><p>Yields on U.S. government debt, which largely reflect investors' expectations for benchmark interest rates through the maturity date, climbed on Wednesday. The 10-year yield rose to 4.102%, from 3.996% the day before. The two-year yield, more sensitive to short-term rate expectations, was at 4.533%, up from 4.435% on Tuesday. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>In other earnings news, Procter &amp; Gamble shares climbed 2.5% after the consumer-goods company lowered its outlook for full-year sales and itsquarterly earnings came in above Wall Street's estimates. Netflix jumped 14% after it said it gained2.4 million new subscribers last quarter, more than double the level it was expecting.</p><p>But Ally Financial, a major consumer lender, fell 5.7% after it reported a drop in earnings and said it set aside more funds in reserve against potential loan losses.</p><p>Tesla and IBM are expected to report earnings after markets close.</p><p>Oil prices edged up, with global crude benchmark Brent climbing 0.8% to trade at $90.78 a barrel. Traders are considering the global demand backdrop as well as the potential impact of the Biden administration's plan to sell more oil fromstrategic reserves with the aim of lowering prices.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 slid 0.5%. Dutch semiconductor firm ASML Holding climbed 8.2% after reporting a narrower drop in profit last quarter, driven by record bookings.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks retreated. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 2.4%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Edge Lower as Earnings, Global Inflation Figures Roll In</p>",
