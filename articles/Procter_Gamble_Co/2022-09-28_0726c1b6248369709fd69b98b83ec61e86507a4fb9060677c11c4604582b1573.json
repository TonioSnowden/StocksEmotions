  "title": "Unilever Goes Back to the Drawing Board With Accessible Deodorant Design; The prototype, the winner of design and innovation awards, was deemed unsuitable for mass production after further testing",
  "text": "<p>\"The biggest headline that came from [the trial] is in trying to be inclusive, we were actually being exclusive,\" said Kathryn Swallow, global brand lead for Rexona, the name the Degree brand is sold under in most countries outside of the U.S.</p><p>Now Degree has scrapped its initial product and is working on a more flexible approach: a set of plastic accessories that can be made with 3-D printers and attached to all existing Degree deodorant sticks, rather than a one-size-fits-all roll-on. They include lids with different hooks and grips, as well as bases designed to help some disabled users more easily turn the wheel mechanism that dispenses deodorant.</p><p>\"This is something we're continuing to work on, but we needed to go to the next iteration,\" Ms. Swallow said.</p><p>The episode shows how Unilever's push for its brands to carry a deeper purpose beyond making money is not always a straightforward endeavor when it extends beyond marketing and communications and into product design.</p><p>Degree in 2019 announced that the deodorant had a new mission: to inspire everyone to \"move with confidence.\" That became a launchpad for the brand's inclusive focus; rather than focusing just on able-bodied athletes, the brand's communications included young, old and disabled consumers of various religions in the process of breaking a sweat.</p><p>The brand looked to extend that approach into product innovation. Unilever introduced Degree Inclusive in April 2021 as a \"concept deodorant\" designed to make application easier for people with limited mobility. Conceived in part by WPP PLC advertising agency Wunderman Thompson's Argentine business, the deodorant featured a hanging hook and magnetic closures to make it easier to take the cap off and put it back on again. Openings in the base offered an easier grasp. And a Braille label provided instructions for users with vision impairment.</p><p>The announcement was picked up by the likes of \"Good Morning America,\" Forbes and Elle. The product was nominated for or won more than 50 design, advertising and innovation awards, including the prestigious Grand Prix in the innovation category at the 2021 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, according to a blog post on the ad agency's website.</p><p>Degree didn't say at the time when the deodorant would come to market, but consumers could sign up for updates on its release via a web page.</p><p>The sign-up page was later taken down.</p><p>Behind the scenes, Degree had stumbled onto some problems after building a tool to manufacture a batch for user testing.</p><p>Some testers said the deodorant was too big and heavy to use and carry around, and looked cumbersome and indiscreet. Others said the hooked lid design was irrelevant to their situation, and the awkward shape of the product made it harder to use in practice. And many testers said they would prefer a glide-on stick to a roll-on formula.</p><p>\"The fact that finally a personal care brand is truly taking [accessibility] seriously resonated,\" Ms. Swallow said. But users also said they didn't like the idea of being presented with one solution for all disabilities, given the wide range of mobility among the testing group and disabled community at large, she said.</p><p>Degree is now conducting user testing on the 3-D-printable accessories and figuring out how to distribute them, Ms. Swallow said. Ideas being mulled include funding stores to run 3-D printers, and letting customers request or purchase the accessories online, she said. The company has not yet decided upon the accessories' pricing structure, a spokeswoman for Unilever said.</p><p>The approach is reminiscent of the winged moisturizer lid introduced last year by Olay, owned by Unilever rival Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Designed for people who have difficulty opening its jars, the skin-care brand sends the lids free to consumers who buy certain pots of moisturizer online, and has uploaded the lid's designs online so consumers with access to 3-D printers can download their own. Olay is soliciting feedback on the design from users, a company spokeswoman said.</p><p>Not all accessible product designs get made. A prototype of a pregnancy test that lets blind people read their results through tactile bumps rather than lines in a window was unveiled in 2020 by the Royal National Institute of Blind People in the hope of finding a manufacturer that would pick up the design. But nearly two years on, a spokeswoman for the charity said it doesn't have an update on getting it made.</p><p>Mass manufacturing products that cater to different users' needs is a difficult and often long process, said Josh Loebner, global head of inclusive design at Wunderman Thompson.</p><p>\"Inclusive design and industrial design are both quite complex in and of themselves, and when you weave those togetherâ€¦it's something that doesn't happen at the snap of the finger,\" he said. \"Our team has so much heart for Degree Inclusive and the drive to make the product the best it can be.\"</p><p>The media interest and awards fanfare around Degree Inclusive's initial design was unexpected but helped spark the packaged goods industry's interest in products better designed for disabled people, as well as a wider conversation around inclusivity in the manufacturing process, Ms. Swallow said.</p><p>\"I think it has been an iconic trigger,\" said Ms. Swallow. \"But I don't think it can just be that. It needs to be on a shelf.\"</p><p>Write to Katie Deighton at katie.deighton@wsj.com</p><p>Unilever Goes Back to the Drawing Board With Accessible Deodorant Design</p>",
