  "text": "<p>Elevated demand for paper towels, washing-up liquid and laundry detergent has lasted into the winter, giving Procter &amp; Gamble another bump in sales and prompting the consumer goods bellwether to increase its annual forecasts once again.</p> <p>The household products group predicted that sales of brands including Ariel, Bounty, Tampax, Pampers and Head &amp; Shoulders would remain strong even after the rollout of coronavirus vaccines. </p> <p>Wall Street analysts had forecast P&amp;G's rate of organic sales growth in its financial second quarter to cool from 9 per cent in the previous three months to about 6 per cent, yet the US-based group's latest batch of forecast-beating results indicate the pandemic-induced boost to the business is showing little sign of fading.</p> <p>In fact, it disclosed an 8 per cent year-on-year rise in net sales to $19.7bn.</p> <p>The trend for consumers to stay inside is leading them to wash and cook at home more often than usual. The phenomenon has fuelled demand for a wide range of staples, from dishwashing tablets to toilet paper.</p> <p>Concern about the spread of coronavirus has also made consumers more <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce2b0f65-f98a-49cc-b258-7eb8cc257cc4\">hygiene-conscious</a>, suggesting lasting benefits for companies in the sector including Reckitt Benckiser of the UK and Kleenex maker Kimberly-Clark, as well as Procter &amp; Gamble.</p> <p>Jon Moeller, chief operating officer and chief financial officer, noted that quarterly sales in China, the company's second-largest market, had risen 12 per cent — the same rate as the US — despite reduced coronavirus cases.</p> <p>“If that's representative, there's no indication that vaccine availability, more social mobility, is inherently a demand reducer.” </p> <p>Not all consumer trends in the pandemic have benefited P&amp;G, however. Lockdown restrictions on department stores have hurt sales of premium skincare products, and distribution through venues such as hotels and restaurants has also been diminished, Mr Moeller said.</p> <p>P&amp;G has also incurred higher material costs and safety-related expenses. The cost of products sold increased 4 per cent in the quarter.</p> <p>“We expect some of the current tailwinds to our business will dissipate, but some very strong headwinds should abate or disappear,” he said.</p> <p>Shares in P&amp;G rallied 14 per cent in 2020, although before Wednesday they had shed 3 per cent this year as Wall Street had queried how much longer the boom could continue.</p> <p>Economic weakness has also prompted some analysts to raise concerns about how long shoppers will remain prepared to pay a premium for P&amp;G brands, which tend to be more expensive than rivals.</p> <p>Government stimulus had made a “real difference” so far, Mr Moeller said, although he added that the company would have to see how future fiscal support plays out. </p> <p>Despite the uncertainty, P&amp;G said it was on track to deliver an annual increase in sales of between 5 and 6 per cent in its fiscal year — up from its previous forecast for a rise of between 3 and 4 per cent.</p> <p>Net income in the financial second quarter rose 4 per cent to $3.89bn, equivalent to diluted earnings per share of $1.47. </p> <p>Each of the company's five main divisions posted increases in organic sales, led by a 12 per cent rise at its fabric and home-care division and a 9 per cent gain in healthcare. Even the grooming business, which has been hurt by men's tendency to shave less, produced a 6 per cent increase.</p> <p>P&amp;G was able to edge up prices by 1 per cent, while volumes rose 5 per cent. A more favourable mix of business also contributed to the revenue improvement, and organic sales, which exclude the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 8 per cent overall.</p> <p>Shares in P&amp;G, which has a market capitalisation of $331bn, were little changed in pre-market trading.</p><p>Source: Alistair Gray 2021 'P&amp;G raises annual forecasts on pandemic cleaning boom ' FT.com 20 January.
