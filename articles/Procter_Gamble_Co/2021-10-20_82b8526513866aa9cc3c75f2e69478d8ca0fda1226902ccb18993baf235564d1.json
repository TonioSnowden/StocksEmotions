  "text": "<p>Demand for consumer products has been unusually strong since countries began to reopen their economies. This has put pressure on global transport routes and increased the cost of logistics. In the first quarter of 2020, a company could ship goods by sea for $1,600 per 40-foot equivalent unit, or roughly one large shipping container. By September 2021, the bill had climbed to $10,200, Bernstein analysis shows.</p><p>Air and road travel is also pricier, as there are fewer jets in the skies and transport firms are struggling to hire drivers. Europe is short of approximately 400,000 truckers, according to Transport Intelligence estimates. A similar shortage in the U.S. pushed spot rates for dry trucks up 13% on the year by the third quarter.</p><p>The burden of higher distribution costs, which can represent anywhere from 5% to 10% of consumer companies' revenue in a normal year, will be felt differently by brands. A lot depends on the length of their supply chains, pre-existing contracts with transport firms and their ability to pass on higher costs to shoppers.</p><p>Brands that clock up the most miles are clearly exposed. Fast-fashion retailer H&amp;M recently warned that more clothing may need to be sold at a discount in its current quarter. Shipping delays mean that inventory is arriving late from factories in Asia, where 69% of the brand's manufacturing base is located, according to Bank of America estimates. Its rival Inditex, which owns chains such as Zara and Massimo Dutti, is in better shape as its production is closer to Europe.</p><p>Premium brands can offset the problem with higher prices. Sportswear giant Nike recently said sales will be lower than expected in its current fiscal year as it can't get its hands on enough stock from Asia. But the company still expects to grow its gross margin by increasing prices and doing more transactions online, where sales are particularly lucrative. Luxury labels including Louis Vuitton and Gucci are more shielded again as their customers are relatively insensitive to price increases.</p><p>Not all consumer companies have completely outsourced their logistics needs, which is now a strength. Major supermarkets like Walmart have big in-house fleets. So do some global brewers: Around 40% of Heineken's logistics are carried out by its own trucks. At Corona brewer Constellation Brands, 70% of its transport costs are for rail, where prices haven't increased as much as by road, according to Bernstein.</p><p>Manufacturers of staple household goods like Nestle and Unilever tend to have multiyear agreements that guarantee them a certain amount of capacity on external transport companies' networks. The price of these contracts is going up, but not by as much as spot rates. Food manufacturers may find it harder to increase prices though, if consumers begin to trade down to cheaper alternatives like store brands.</p><p>Procter &amp; Gamble on Tuesday reported that organic sales grew 4% in the quarter through September, though diluted earnings per share fell 1% as gross margins narrowed by 3.7 percentage points. Inflationary pressures, the company's chief financial officer said, \"are broad-based and sustained.\" The company said it still forecasts earnings-per-share growth of 6% to 9% for the full fiscal year through June, as price increases and cost cuts take full effect. But investors remain unconvinced: Shares were down around 2% in morning trading.</p><p>So far, the market appears to think the problem is manageable, or hopes that the crunch will be short term and buoyant consumers will continue to accept price rises. For example, analysts expect gross margins at fashion chains Inditex, H&amp;M and Primark's owner ABF to be broadly stable over the next three years, according to FactSet data.</p><p>The longer transport routes are snarled, the more optimistic such forecasts will start to look.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
