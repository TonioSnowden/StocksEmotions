  "title": "Business News:  Nestle Sales Rise as Shoppers Shrug Off Higher Prices  ----  By Saabira Chaudhuri",
  "text": "<p>   Nestle SA said consumers continued to snap up Nescafe coffee and Purina pet food, even as the packaged-food giant raised prices again to offset rampant cost inflation. </p><p>   Companies have been grappling with sharp rises in the cost of energy, packaging and transport as the pandemic eases. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has further stoked the cost of inputs like cooking oil and grains. U.S. inflation hit a 40-year high in March, while consumer prices in the European Union hit a record peak. </p><p>   On Thursday, Nestle reported first-quarter results showing shoppers so far haven't been deterred by its efforts to offset those cost increases. The Swiss company said sales on an organic basis, which strips out currency changes and the impact of mergers and acquisitions, climbed 7.6% in the first three months of the year. That figure excluded its business in Russia, where it halted sales of some products. </p><p>   Overall, reported sales rose 5.4% to 22.2 billion Swiss francs, equivalent to about $23.4 billion. Nestle -- which doesn't give profit figures in the first quarter -- said overall prices rose 5.2%, while volumes climbed 2.4%. </p><p>   Chief Executive Mark Schneider said Nestle so far had enjoyed \"sustained consumer demand,\" but that it would raise prices further this year because of the continued sharp increase in inflation, in part driven by the war in Ukraine. </p><p>   Mr. Schneider said Nestle did expect some moderation in demand later this year as a result of higher prices. \"When you stack all of these price increases on top of each other, it does have some impact on what the consumer has to pay for the basket,\" he said. </p><p>   Price growth was highest in North America, up 8.5%, where volumes rose 1.4%. The company said its Purina pet food brand was the largest growth contributor in the region, driven by upscale brands and online sales. </p><p>   Mr. Schneider said Nestle could have sold more in North America had it not been for supply-chain constraints on raw materials, labor and distribution. \"Distribution capacity is super, super tight,\" he said. </p><p>   Nestle shares closed up slightly on Thursday. </p><p>   The update from Nestle is the latest indication that shoppers have been willing to stick with big brands despite rising prices. Procter &amp; Gamble Co. posted Wednesday its biggest quarterly sales gain in decades. However, the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette razors warned that shoppers may yet balk at rising prices for household staples. French beauty giant L'Oreal SA reported Tuesday strong first-quarter sales, saying consumer purchasing behavior so far had been unaffected by inflation. </p><p>   Nestle's earnings offered further clues as to how some pandemic-era consumer behavior is shifting, as people return to eating out. Nestle said in North America, its professional business and its Starbucks out-of-home products -- both of which supply places like offices and hotels -- reported double-digit sales growth. </p><p>   By contrast, sales of frozen ready meals in North America, which performed well at the height of the pandemic, declined. Nestle's vitamins, minerals and supplements business grew only slightly after a strong run through the pandemic amid heightened consumer concerns about health. </p><p></p>",
