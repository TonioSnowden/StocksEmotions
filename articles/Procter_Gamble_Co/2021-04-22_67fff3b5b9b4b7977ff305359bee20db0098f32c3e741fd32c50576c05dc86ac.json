  "text": "<p>A surge in home coffee drinking helped Nestlé achieve its fastest quarterly sales growth in a decade as consumers snapped up Nespresso pods, Nescafé instant coffee and Starbucks-branded products.</p> <p>The world's largest foodmaker reported sales growth of 7.7 per cent, calculated on an organic basis — which strips out the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and currency movements — in the three months to March, above last year's 4.3 per cent and much higher than the 3.3 per cent analysts had forecast.</p> <p>The rise was propelled in part by a 17.1 per cent jump in sales of Nespresso products, along with higher sales of instant coffee and Starbucks-branded coffee sold in stores under a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e73fd2aa-51ca-11e8-b24e-cad6aa67e23e\">partnership</a> agreed by chief executive Mark Schneider three years ago.</p> <p>Strong sales of dairy products, helped by a continued vogue for home baking, and pet food, such as the Purina brand, also drove growth. Consumer groups from distiller Pernod Ricard to household goods maker Procter &amp; Gamble have reported better than expected growth this week, signalling a broader resurgence of consumer spending.</p> <p>Nestlé's growth was also affected by inflation: it said higher pricing related to increasing commodity costs pushed up revenues by 1.2 per cent. Organic sales growth was its highest in 10 years, said analysts.</p> <p>Schneider said the company was gaining market share. “We are pleased with Nestlé's strong organic sales growth in the first quarter, building on broad-based contributions from most geographies and product categories,” he added. “Retail sales saw solid growth and out-of-home channels saw signs of improvement.”</p> <p>Shares in the group rose 3.5 per cent to SFr110.48 in afternoon trading.</p> <p>The maker of KitKat, Maggi noodles and Häagen-Dazs ice cream has performed strongly during the pandemic as coronavirus curbs forced households to eat and drink at home, along with boosting pet ownership.</p> <p>The strong first-quarter performance was also helped by a recovery from the pandemic in China, where eating out — another business area for Nestlé, which supplies restaurants — has rebounded from a year ago, when coronavirus and measures to limit its spread were affecting life there.</p> <p>Schneider is pursuing a long-term target of mid-single-digit growth each year and has been selling off underperforming parts of the Nestlé portfolio, such as most of its North American bottled water business, which was sold to private equity buyers in March.</p> <p>Jean-Philippe Bertschy, analyst at Vontobel, called the latest figures “spectacular”, adding that digital commerce and “faster, bolder innovations” had helped Nestlé to add market share.</p> <p>The sales boost was damped by currency effects as the Swiss franc appreciated against other currencies. Total reported sales rose 1.3 per cent to SFr21.1bn ($23bn) for the quarter, up from SFr20.8bn a year earlier.</p><p>Source: Judith Evans 2021 'Nestlé sales propelled by pandemic coffee surge' FT.com 22 April.
