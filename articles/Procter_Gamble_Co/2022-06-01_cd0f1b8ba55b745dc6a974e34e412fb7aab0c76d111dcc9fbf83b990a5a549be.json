  "title": "P&G-Style Makeover Is A Big Ask For Unilever --- Activist's hopes for a repeat may be too high",
  "text": "<p>On Tuesday, Unilever said Trian Partners founder Nelson Peltz will take a seat on the company's board from July. After months of speculation that the activist bought shares in Unilever, the company confirmed his hedge fund owns a 1.5% stake, currently valued at around $1.6 billion. Mr. Peltz will join Unilever's compensation committee and may want changes to pay incentives.</p><p>At P&amp;G, he criticized targets that rewarded top executives for sales growth that was below the industry average.</p><p>Unilever's shares rose more than 9% on Tuesday.</p><p>Investors may be hoping that an activist campaign at the U.K. company will create a P&amp;G-style uplift in the share price. The U.S. company's stock almost doubled in value between early 2018 when Mr. Peltz got a board seat and when he stood down 3 1/2 years later.</p><p>Trian's record at its last big European target in the sector is patchier. The fund disclosed a stake in Evian bottled water maker Danone in November 2012, when the company's shares were trading at around 48 euros, equivalent to $51. After predicting the stock would hit 78 euros within two years, the fund cashed out in February 2015 when it was priced at roughly 60 euros.</p><p>The presence of an activist investor may speed up the disposal of Unilever's less appealing brands. Earlier this year, Chief Executive Alan Jope said he was open to a sale of the company's food brands to fund a bid for GlaxoSmithKline's consumer healthcare business -- although this approach was called off.</p><p>Selling underperforming beauty brands to Coty helped to improve P&amp;G's sales growth, but the biggest boost came from doing a better job with its existing brands. Between 2015 and 2019, stopping market share losses delivered 2.4 percentage points of additional sales growth, based on Bernstein estimates.</p><p>Unilever is making progress here. In the first quarter, 58% of its business was winning market share, up from 53% in the fourth quarter of 2021.</p><p>This will be tough to maintain as consumer incomes are squeezed. Private-label brands are winning customers in Europe, where inflation is running at 8.1%. Big brands need to increase prices to protect their profit margins, but their products are less competitive as a result. Danone, Unilever and Nestle all lost market share to store brands in Europe over the four weeks to April 24, according to Nielsen data.</p><p>Unilever has a particular challenge because of where it sells. It makes 60% of group sales in emerging markets, where inflation is higher than in developed countries and average incomes lower. P&amp;G makes half its sales in North America, where consumer spending is for now proving resilient.</p><p>A board refresh is good news for Unilever investors, but the company is embarking on a turnaround in a much tougher market than P&amp;G.</p>",
