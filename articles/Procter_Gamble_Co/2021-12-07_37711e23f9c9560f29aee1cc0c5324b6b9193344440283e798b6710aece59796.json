  "text": "<p>A few years ago, the studio ventured to Pasadena for a retreat at the 1908 Gamble House, created by Charles and Henry Greene for a scion of the Procter &amp; Gamble company. The hand-built bungalow encapsulates the idea of gesamtkunstwerk, or total work of art, common in the American arts and crafts movement, which is another Commune touchstone, says principal Roman Alonso. \"And the Gamble House is the big mack daddy of that,\" he says.</p><p>Once the carpet collection was a reality, Alonso and Johanknecht asked if they might slip some rugs into the Gamble house, at least for a photo shoot. The answer was yes. \"It was kind of a dream,\" Alonso says of the experience. \"The craftsmanship is exquisite. And it's just so incredible how Greene and Greene did every single thing in it.\" From $11,000; communedesign.com; christopherfarr.com.</p><p>These Rugs Are Inspired by the Plant Life of California</p>",
