  "text": "<p>ESG funds have proved they can survive — and even thrive — in a crisis. Some $2bn a day flowed into sustainable funds in the first quarter of this year, according to Morningstar. </p> <p>That was half of all European fund flows into the sector. But as investors ramp up calls for sustainability at every company, and regulators set more targets for eliminating emissions, ESG has a finite future as a discrete category. </p> <p>It is not hard to imagine a&#xa0;time when these specialist funds will be redundant. </p> <p>Last week, activists showed they could push back against fossil-fuel producers without the help of ESG investors. </p> <p>Shareholders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da6dec6a-6c58-427f-a012-9c1efb71fddf\">shook up ExxonMobil's board of directors</a> and forced fellow US oil major Chevron to consider reducing its scope 3 emissions, or those from the products it produces. </p> <p>Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell, meanwhile, was ordered by a court in the Netherlands&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/content-340501e2-e0cd-4ea5-b388-9af0d9a74ce2/xwHC3aIfe_CZf-iuk8NrUg~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRikgt2P0SPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvMzQwNTAxZTItZTBjZC00ZWE1LWIzODgtOWFmMGQ5YTc0Y2UyP2VtYWlsSWQ9NjBhZjgzYWU3YWJlY2MwMDA0ODUzYjA3JnNlZ21lbnRJZD0xM2I3ZTM0MS1lZDAyLTJiNTMtZThjMC1kOWNiNTliZThiM2JXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgpgrpeGr2B5ov3KUhNsb3Vpc2UubHVjYXNAZnQuY29tWAQAAAAA\">to aggressively increase</a>&#xa0;its emissions cuts, a ruling that could set a global precedent.</p> <p>A swath of investors and activists are calling time on global polluters. They include Chris Hohn's Say on Climate and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. The latter is chaired by Michael Bloomberg and backed by supporters with an aggregate market cap of $23tn. </p> <p>Yet the push for corporate sustainability and transparency on meeting targets has not rendered ESG-themed funds redundant quite yet. For one, managers running funds that are not ESG specific are limited in the ground they can cover. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3427fd3-34e0-44fd-b1cc-7a19d907470f\">BlackRock discovered</a> as much when it took the high ground against Procter &amp; Gamble over the consumer product giant's sourcing of palm oil from an Indonesian company in which it also held a stake. </p> <p>The investment industry is split as to how to proceed. Institutional investors hold sway over the companies they partially own, but are not best placed to set targets or plot paths towards decarbonisation. </p> <p>Besides, investors have different views on, say, the use of carbon offsets or whether traditional energy players can convert themselves into renewables. </p> <p>There is also no standardisation across countries or even in-country regulators yet, which hobbles corporate compliance. Investors who want to play by the sustainable book will have to hang on to those ESG labels for a while yet.</p> <p><em>Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice weekly.
