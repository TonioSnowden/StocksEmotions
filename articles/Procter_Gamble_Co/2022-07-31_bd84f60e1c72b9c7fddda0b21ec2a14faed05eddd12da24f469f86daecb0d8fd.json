  "title": "A Banana Boat Sunscreen Spray Was Recalled Due to Presence of Carcinogen Benzene; Trace amounts of the cancer-causing chemical were found in some samples of Hair & Scalp SPF 30 sunscreen aerosol products",
  "text": "<p>The company said benzene isn't an ingredient in any Banana Boat product, but an internal review showed that unexpected levels of the chemical came from the propellant that sprays the sunscreen out of the can.</p><p>Exposure to benzene could potentially result in blood disorders, leukemia and other cancers, the company said. Edgewell said it hasn't received any notice of adverse events related to the recall to date.</p><p>\"Daily exposure to benzene in the recalled products would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences according to an independent health assessment using established exposure modeling guidelines,\" the company said.</p><p>The Shelton, Conn.-based company said in its voluntary recall that the affected products have expiration dates of December 2022, February 2023 and April 2024.</p><p>Consumers can identify possibly tainted products by the lot numbers on the bottom of Banana Boat Hair &amp; Scalp Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 cans.</p><p>Lot numbers 20016AF, 20084BF and 21139AF shouldn't be used, the company said.</p><p>Banana Boat will offer reimbursement to consumers who bought the recalled sunscreen spray products packaged in aerosol cans.</p><p>The products were distributed nationwide in the U.S. through various retailers and online. Edgewell said it has notified its retailers to remove any remaining recalled product from shelves.</p><p>Benzene, a colorless chemical with a sweet odor, is found in natural sources like volcanoes and forest fires, and can also be man-made, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>It is widely used in the U.S., ranking in the top 20 chemicals for production volume, the CDC said.</p><p>In July 2021, Johnson &amp; Johnson recalled most of its Neutrogena and Aveeno spray sunscreens from U.S. stores after detecting benzene in some samples. Later that year, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. issued a recall for its Old Spice and Secret antiperspirant sprays after benzene was detected in some of the products.</p><p>Write to Ginger Adams Otis at Ginger.AdamsOtis@wsj.com</p><p>A Banana Boat Sunscreen Spray Was Recalled Due to Presence of Carcinogen Benzene</p>",
