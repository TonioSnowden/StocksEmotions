  "text": "<p>Looking ahead, many finance chiefs said they're expecting more of the same when it comes to rising costs. Below are excerpts from recent quarterly calls that have been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Ian Borden, CFO, McDonald's Corp.</p><p>There are really a couple of drivers for this year that resulted in that adjusted outlook. The first one is the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. So if you think of our [general and administrative expenses] formula to get to the percentage, 60% of our sales come from outside of the U.S. Obviously, we're translating those sales back into less U.S. dollars and 70% of our G&amp;A spend is U.S.-dollar based. So that's the first impact.</p><p>The second impact is obviously just the general inflationary pressures that we're seeing on costs, which obviously is also coming to play in our G&amp;A expenses. I think what I would say, coming into the role, is certainly it's an area that I'm going to be focused on. I think we continue to believe that in terms of the running-the-business part of our G&amp;A spend, we should be able to drive efficiency and gain leverage as we continue to go through our top line as we go forward. (Oct. 27)</p><p>Susan Li, vice president of finance and incoming CFO, Meta Platforms Inc.</p><p>We expect 2023 [capital expenditures] to be in the range of $34 billion to $39 billion, with our investments in [artificial intelligence] driving all of that growth. We're very focused on evaluating the [return on investment] of our AI investments, and that'll inform our level of future spend. But so far, we've seen [a] continued strong impact on our recommendations products from advancing developments in our AI work.</p><p>…We think we're early in this journey, but our level of CapEx investment will depend on the returns that we generate through these investments in AI. And if we generate significant engagement and revenue gains, we'll continue investing here. And if we don't, we'll pace our spending accordingly. (Oct. 26)</p><p>Matt Puckett, CFO, VF Corp.</p><p>We believe there's quite a bit that's impacting us this year—that is, I'll say, relatively short-term in nature—impacting the margins. And that's primarily and certainly in the gross margin line.…From a margin standpoint, we're dealing with higher levels of inefficiencies from a supply-chain standpoint, freight and how we're moving freight. The extra storage costs given the higher inventory levels is transitory.</p><p>But then really the big one is the assumptions that we're making right now relative to what may be required in the marketplace from a promotional standpoint, both [in] our own channels, but also in support of our wholesalers. (Oct. 26)</p><p>Gina Goetter, CFO, Harley-Davidson Inc.</p><p>We're just in the midst of budgeting. So we're not going to comment terribly much on what the outlook is for next year. But keep in mind a couple of things: One, our rule of thumb is that we're going to take enough pricing that's offsetting the cost inflation; and then the second piece is this FX headwind that's coming at us. So it will be material for us next year, and we're just kind of shaking and figuring out how much of that pricing is going to be able to offset the FX for next year. (Oct. 26)</p><p>John Vandemore, CFO, Skechers USA Inc.</p><p>I think it's important to keep in mind that a portion of [our] inventory build is purely cost-based, right? You can't incur the type of freight escalation and logistics escalation we've had over the last year without it impacting your on-hand balances, because it just flows through that way. I would say, if we think about it from a unit perspective, which is a more modest growth than what we saw on the dollar side of it, we do expect things to begin ticking down.</p><p>Now some of that is going to be contingent upon how the supply chain unfolds. Because, again, this is not a situation where inventory backed up because of a lack of demand. That's definitely not the situation we're in. And so it really has to do with logistics and timing—all the things that we've had a very tough time predicting well over the last couple of years. (Oct. 25)</p><p>Neil Mitchill, CFO, Raytheon Technologies Corp.</p><p>We'll also introduce revised pricing as we usually do at the beginning of the year. We do expect that to be considerably higher than what we've seen in the past, reflecting the inflation that we're dealing with across the business. So we're attacking both price and cost as we look at the business going forward.</p><p>...[M]any of the projects that we have looked at around footprint consolidation and automation and digitization of our factories are much more attractive with the inflationary pressures that we're seeing today. (Oct. 25)</p><p>Andre Schulten, CFO, Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</p><p>In terms of consumer sentiment, in general, we see part of the consumer base in Fabric Care, for example, trending up, as I mentioned, into single-unit dose. We see some growth also in our mid-tier brands.…We are also seeing consumers moving to different price points. So a group of consumers is looking for value by trading into higher-transaction sizes to find lower cost per use or lower cost per unit. And we see other consumers who are more cash conscious, and they are very focused on cash outlay. (Oct. 19)</p><p>Sandeep Reddy, CFO, Domino's Pizza Inc.</p><p>When we talk about the impact of inflation, it is not just a domestic impact, it's international as well. So the same dynamics that we talked about being a pressure point would be an impact internationally…And I think the risk is when you have a very significant inflation, consumers may actually switch to cooking at home and preparing food at all. And that's just the risk factor. We are in unprecedented inflationary times.</p><p>So how consumer behavior evolves right now is still a little bit more to be seen, but our testing models show that there's a higher likelihood of switching if inflation remains at these elevated levels.
