  "title": "P&G Worked With China Firms  To Dodge Apple's Privacy Rules  ----  By Sharon Terlep, Tim Higgins and Patience Haggin",
  "text": "<p>   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. helped develop an advertising technique being tested in China to gather iPhone data for targeted ads, a step intended to give companies a way around Apple Inc.'s new privacy tools, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The move is part of a broad effort by the consumer-goods giant to prepare for an era in which new rules and consumer preferences limit data available to marketers. P&amp;G, among the world's largest advertisers, is the biggest Western company involved in the effort, the people said. </p><p>   The company joined forces with dozens of Chinese trade groups and technology firms working with the state-backed China Advertising Association to develop the technique, which would use technology called device fingerprinting, the people said. Dubbed CAID, the advertising method is being tested through apps and gathers iPhone user data. Through an algorithm, it can track users for the purposes of targeting ads in a way that Apple seeks to prevent. </p><p>   Apple is planning a software update in the coming weeks that will require app users to choose whether they want their activity to be tracked across other companies' apps and websites. Apple touted the software as an important step for putting privacy controls in users' hands. Device fingerprinting runs afoul of Apple's rules, and the company said it would ban any app that violates its policies. </p><p>   \"The App Store terms and guidelines apply equally to all developers around the world, including Apple,\" an Apple spokesman said. \"We believe strongly that users should be asked for their permission before being tracked. Apps that are found to disregard the user's choice will be rejected.\" </p><p>   Facebook Inc. and ad-tech firms are vocal critics of the Apple changes, fearing users won't consent to being tracked. They have said the flow of user data is critical to providing more tailored digital advertising that better resonates with consumers. </p><p>   P&amp;G, whose involvement wasn't previously reported, said it is providing input to the trade group consistent with the company's goal of finding ways to \"deliver useful content consumers want in a way that prioritizes data privacy, transparency and consent. That means partnering with platforms and publishers -- both directly and through our advertising associations across the globe.\" </p><p>   The company declined to provide additional details about the program, including whether it intends to use the technology. </p><p>   P&amp;G was involved in testing CAID, the people said. The testing also involved ByteDance Ltd., the parent of TikTok, and Tencent Holdings Ltd., according to people familiar with the matter. The companies operate some of the most widely used apps in China. </p><p>   Through apps, CAID collects user device data such as the device startup time, model, time zone, country, language, IP address, and other information. Based on China's personal-information-security standards, most of the data aren't counted as \"personal information.\" But a so-called device ID can be generated by an algorithm based on the data. That device ID can achieve a similar tracking effect as the identifier that Apple is allowing users to block. </p><p>   CAID can be used without user consent. If in operation, it could track activity even if a user opted out of tracking through a pop-up prompt Apple is using with the rollout of new privacy controls. Recently, Apple issued warning letters to app developers who used tools like CAID, asking them to remove those within 14 days. </p><p>   Also involved in the effort are business units of accounting firms Deloitte LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers as well as ratings company Nielsen Holdings PLC, according to documents of the advertising association that were viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Representatives for PwC and Nielsen didn't respond to requests to comment, and a spokeswoman for Deloitte declined to comment. </p><p>   Apple's changes are expected to most affect marketers, such as game makers, that aim to get apps installed on iPhones. Large advertisers such P&amp;G, which can use their own data for advertising, will see less impact, said Aaron Shapiro, former chief executive and co-founder of Huge, a digital-ad agency that worked with P&amp;G and McDonald's and was acquired by Interpublic Group. </p><p>   Still, P&amp;G, which has spent years building a formidable data operation, has a lot at stake. </p><p>   \"Even if this issue is not a problem, they might just be forward-thinking, which is they have to proactively put in place solutions for future clampdowns that are going to happen,\" Mr. Shapiro said. </p><p>   P&amp;G spent $7.3 billion on advertising in the past fiscal year and has long used its hefty ad budgets to push the tech industry for better ways to prove digital ads reach their targets. P&amp;G marketing chief Marc Pritchard advocated for a universal way to track users across platforms, including those run by Facebook and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, that protects privacy while giving marketers information to better hone their messages. </p><p>   Frustrated with what it saw as tech companies' lack of transparency, P&amp;G began building its own consumer database several years ago, seeking to generate detailed intelligence on consumer behavior without relying on data gathered by tech platforms. The information is a combination of anonymous consumer IDs culled from devices and personal information customers share willingly. The company said in 2019 that it had amassed 1.5 billion consumer identifications world-wide. </p><p>   China, where Facebook and Google have a limited presence, is P&amp;G's most sophisticated market for using that database. The company funnels 80% of its digital-ad buying there through \"programmatic ads\" that let it target people with the highest propensity to buy without presenting them with irrelevant or excessive ads, P&amp;G Chief Executive David Taylor said at a conference last year. \"We are reinventing brand building, from wasteful mass marketing to mass one-to-one brand building fueled by data and technology,\" he said. </p><p>   China is P&amp;G's second-largest market. The company said in 2017 it would invest $100 million into its China digital innovation center, in part to bolster its digital marketing. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Yang Jie contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
