  "title": "Technology:  Black-Owned Media Venture Seeks Deals  ----  By Alexandra Bruell, Keach Hagey and Suzanne Vranica",
  "text": "<p>   Group Black, a company that aims to invest in and develop Black-owned media firms, is pursuing big potential acquisitions in the digital-media space, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The company, co-founded last year by Black entrepreneurs Travis Montaque, Richelieu Dennis and Bonin Bough, is in talks to buy a large or majority stake in Bustle owner BDG Media Inc., some of the people said, and is exploring how to finance a deal as the two sides talk. Group Black also has been exploring other potential deals, including an acquisition of Vice Media, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Describing itself as a media collective and accelerator, Group Black was created when the ad industry started facing calls to spend more money advertising on minority-owned outlets. One of its primary goals is to increase the amount of Black-owned media, including by acquiring existing high-profile media brands and adding more multicultural voices and influence, Mr. Montaque said. </p><p>   Group Black helps advertisers buy ads with its member companies, which includes outfits such as Essence Communications Inc., the publisher of Essence magazine, which Mr. Dennis bought from Time Inc. in 2018; Holler Technologies Inc., which specializes in stickers and GIFs for digital messages and posts, which Mr. Montaque founded; e-sports startup PlayVS and entertainment news sites Shade Room LLC and Baller Alert Inc. </p><p>   The collective has grown to about 200 companies, according to a spokeswoman. </p><p>   Group Black said it didn't own the member companies but works with them on matters like ad commitments. </p><p>   The company has attracted about $500 million in ad-spending commitments from companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble Co., as well as ad holding companies WPP, Dentsu and Interpublic Group of Cos, according to a spokeswoman. </p><p>   Group Black's talks with BDG are preliminary and could fall apart, people familiar with the discussions said. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Lazard Ltd. are advising Group Black on both M&amp;A and fundraising initiatives, said Mr. Montaque, the company's chief executive and co-founder. </p><p>   He declined to comment on whether the company had already secured funding for potential media deals. </p><p>   Closely held BDG, which beyond Bustle, owns publications such as W and Gawker, and was valued at more than $300 million in 2019, according to research firm PitchBook Data. The company generated about $140 million in revenue in 2021, a person familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Both BDG and Vice Media had expressed plans last year to go public through mergers with special-purpose acquisition companies, but the SPAC market has since cooled off. Digital-media peer BuzzFeed Inc., which went public in a SPAC deal in December, since has lost about 85% of its market value. </p><p>   Vice Media, the media company that once was valued at $5.7 billion and attracted investment and partnerships with media companies ranging from Walt Disney Co. to HBO, has been on the block in recent months, according to documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   The Information reported in April that Vice had hired financial advisers to explore the sale of its studio business. CNBC later reported that Vice was looking to sell itself either whole or in parts. </p><p></p>",
