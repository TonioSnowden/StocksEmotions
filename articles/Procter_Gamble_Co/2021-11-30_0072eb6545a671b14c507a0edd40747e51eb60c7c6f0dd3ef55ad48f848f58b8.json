  "title": "Schick Owner Edgewell Personal Care Buys Women's Razor Brand Billie; The $310 million deal comes after federal regulators had blocked a deal for Gillette parent Procter & Gamble to acquire the startup",
  "text": "<p>Founded in 2017, Billie targets younger consumers with campaigns that show leg and body hair and promise more affordable products. Billie has a marketing campaign around the so-called pink tax, coined from a study that found that women's products cost more than similar offerings for men, especially in consumer products.</p><p>P&amp;G, which commands more than half of the roughly $3 billion U.S. shaving market with Gillette and other brands, announced plans to buy Billie in January 2020. The Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal, arguing that P&amp;G's strategy for the brand, which regulators said included halting plans to expand Billie sales into stores, stifled competition in an already consolidated category.</p><p>P&amp;G walked away from the deal in January.</p><p>P&amp;G for decades has dominated the lucrative market for men's razors but took some hits in recent years, as online upstarts like Harry's and Dollar Shave Club lured customers with cheaper, no-frills razors and blades. P&amp;G in 2017 cut prices and later acquired some smaller brands. The company lately has been growing sales both with Gillette and through newly-acquired brands.</p><p>The FTC also blocked Edgewell from buying Harry's in a $1.37 billion deal, saying that the transaction would lead to higher consumer prices. Edgewell abandoned the deal in early 2020.</p><p>Edgewell Chief Executive Rod Little said Billie has grown sales by 50% annually for the past few years and has about 2.5 million customers. He said the brand will go on sale this winter at a bricks-and-mortar retailer, which he declined to name, with plans for a broader retailer expansion. Billie agreed to be sold exclusively for a period at the first retailer.</p><p>\"Not only is this not anti-competitive, it's pro-competitive for us to bring a brand that is digitally native but lacking resources and scale to roll out effectively and efficiently,\" he said. Edgewell already produces Billie's blades under a deal that predates the acquisition announced Monday.</p><p>Co-founders Jason Bravman and Georgina Gooley will continue to run the brand, which will remain based in New York.</p><p>Edgewell grew annual sales by 4% for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the first year-over-year increase since battery-maker Energizer Holdings Inc. was spun off from the company in 2015. The company's shares are up close to 20% from a year ago.</p><p>Write to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com</p><p>Schick Owner Edgewell Personal Care Buys Women's Razor Brand Billie</p>",
