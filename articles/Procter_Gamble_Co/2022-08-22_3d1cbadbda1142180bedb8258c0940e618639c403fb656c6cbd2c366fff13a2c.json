  "title": "Levi's CEO Chip Bergh Says Skinny Jeans Will Never Die; The denim brand's chief executive talks about trends, his extensive denim collection and how he squeezes in two workouts a day.",
  "text": "<p>Bergh says the pandemic accelerated the current denim trend cycle, but he thinks a looser, straighter silhouette should stick around for a while. \"You see it on the cool kids,\" says Bergh. When people ask him how long the new look will last, he points to the life cycle of skinnies, which emerged around 2008, driven by innovation around stretch, and lasted through the 2010s.</p><p>Before joining Levi's in 2011, Bergh worked at Procter &amp; Gamble for almost three decades after serving in the Army. Here, the executive discusses his intensive exercise routine, the luxury brand he'd most like to collaborate with and why he believes CEOs should speak out on social issues.</p><p>What time do you get up on Mondays, and what's the first thing you do after waking up?</p><p>I get up at 5 a.m. every morning. I drink a 12-ounce glass of ice water, and I have a cup of coffee. I scan the news. By about 5:15, I'm out the door and heading to a pool where I swim between 3,500 and 4,500 yards.</p><p>Are you one of those \"four hours a night is all I need!\" people with sleep, or do you need a minimum to recharge?</p><p>I'm usually in bed by about 9:30, sometimes as late as 10. I'm getting older so I don't sleep as well. That's the bad news. The good news is they say the older you get, the less sleep you need. I try to get between six and seven hours of sleep a night.</p><p>Do you take any vitamins?</p><p>I take vitamin D mostly for bone strength. I have a little bit of bone issues, so I also take a calcium supplement and a fish oil supplement.</p><p>Is swimming the main part of your exercise routine?</p><p>I consider myself an athlete first, a husband and father second, a CEO third. I really focus on taking care of myself, eating healthy and getting plenty of exercise—typically 10 to 12 hours a week. There are days where I will work out twice, I'll swim in the morning and I might run or lift weights at lunchtime or later in the day.</p><p>You were part of a group of CEOs who sent a letter to the Senate about gun control. Why speak out on issues like that one?</p><p>Our store managers were concerned that people were walking into their stores with a weapon. We have a lot of states in this country where you can open-carry, and our store managers have people walking into the store with a weapon. You don't know if they're a good guy or a bad guy. And then tragically, we actually had a weapon go off in one of our stores accidentally.</p><p>We view the gun-violence epidemic as one of the issues that's ripping this country apart. We've made progress. The recent legislation that has passed—we're not going to take credit for it, but over 300 CEOs signed that letter. I think the voice of the business community really did have an impact.</p><p>How many pairs of jeans do you own?</p><p>Too many to count. It's an occupational hazard of this job. My wife hates it. I have well over 100 pairs of jeans at this point. And I've donated a bunch in the last two or three years, too. I have jeans in my closet that I don't even think I've worn. And then I have my go-to jeans that I wear all the time.</p><p>Is there a particular designer you'd love to work with on a collaboration whom you haven't yet?</p><p>I'd love to work with Dior. [Also,] we worked with Tremaine Emory, who had a brand called Denim Tears. He's now the lead designer at Supreme, and I'm hoping that we will be able to continue to partner with him, even though Supreme is owned by one of our competitors.</p><p>Do you worry about the environment and overproduction?</p><p>I'm really concerned about it. It's real, I think it's indisputable. Anybody who's still trying to debate has their head in the sand.</p><p>We have a Levi's secondhand program where users can bring product to our store. We'll repair it, we'll wash it, we'll get it ready and we'll post it for resale, and we give the consumer a gift coupon to buy something new. We're one of the few brands where consumers will pay a premium for something that's 25 years old.</p><p>We're trying to lead when it comes to sustainability: using less water, eliminating harmful chemicals from our supply chain. A lot of the innovation that we've built from a sustainability standpoint, we'll give it to our competitors. It's the right thing to do when it comes to planet Earth.</p><p>What's one piece of advice you've gotten that's guided you?</p><p>One of the phrases I use, and I try to live by this, is do the harder right over the easier wrong. We're also going to be faced with choices in our life… but doing the harder right over the easier wrong is always going to take you to the right outcome.</p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Levi's CEO Chip Bergh Says Skinny Jeans Will Never Die</p>",
