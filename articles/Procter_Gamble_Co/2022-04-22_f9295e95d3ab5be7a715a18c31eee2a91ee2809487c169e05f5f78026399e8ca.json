  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>The bad news for the UK economy keeps on coming. Today's instalments showed consumer confidence dropping close to levels last seen in 1974, a sharp drop in retail sales, business activity cooling and the pound falling to its lowest level since 2020.</p> <p>Research company GfK's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/113d93fb-add5-46e2-a482-114cab7b00ea\">consumer confidence</a> index fell seven points to minus 38 in April, mirroring similar declines in surveys from Deloitte, KPMG and Bank of America and highlighting growing concerns over the soaring cost of living. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e15eaaf-e987-4263-979c-81330035b152\">Retail sales data</a> for March meanwhile showed volumes fell by a more than expected 1.4 per cent, the first sign in official figures of the impact high inflation is having on consumer spending, with worse data likely to follow as a result of April increases in energy bills and taxes. Annual inflation is currently running at a 30-year high of 7 per cent. </p> <p>UK households are also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49be84ba-73ab-4a31-90be-f7dd0a0e7943\">investing less</a>, according to AJ Bell, one of the country's biggest investment platforms.</p> <p>Finally, new estimates from S&amp;P Global for its purchasing managers' index — a more timely and forward-looking indicator than government data — show business activity suffering a “considerable loss of momentum”.&#xa0; The “flash” reading for April was a lower than expected&#xa0;57.6, where 50 marks the divide between activity growing and shrinking, compared with 60.9 the previous month, as increasing uncertainty around the war in Ukraine added to inflationary pressures facing business. </p> <p>The retail and PMI data led economists to forecast a more aggressive programme of interest rate rises from the Bank of England, sparking a 1 per cent drop in the pound against the US dollar to $1.289.&#xa0;</p> <p>Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global, commented: “Orders received by manufacturers have almost stalled, driven by an increasing loss of exports, and growth of demand for services has slumped to among the weakest since the lockdowns of early 2021.”</p> <p>Today's data follow new projections from the IMF on Wednesday that the UK would have the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ac7e454-5a0c-4094-90af-fb54404d45a0\">slowest growth in the G7</a> next year, undermining oft-repeated claims by prime minister Boris Johnson that the country was the fastest-growing G7 economy because of the success of its Covid vaccination programme and swift recovery from coronavirus.</p> <p>Although a global pandemic followed by war are unique circumstances, many of the UK's economic problems stem rather from long-recognised causes such as a lack of business investment and the country's inability to solve the “productivity puzzle”, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/774b191a-d2af-4990-a48c-83d3b01a610c\">FT editorial board</a> argues.<br><br>“Many of the UK's other growth problems, whether its distance from the European single market or the country's restrictive planning laws, will take serious political capital to fix,” the FT says. But as long as the country's politicians are indifferent to its growth problems, this looks a forlorn hope, it concludes. </p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Huggies maker Kimberly-Clark boosts outlook but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98eadbcc-2eaf-4a05-a509-6d91dcbcb583#post-809cdb42-d52d-4f61-b6cd-c206e82e7f06\">warns of higher costs</a> </p></li>  <li><p>UK embassy in Kyiv to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61190310\">reopen next week</a>, Johnson says (BBC)</p></li>  <li><p>Indonesia to ban <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-ban-palm-oil-exports-shore-up-supply-soyoil-futures-surge-2022-04-22/\">palm oil exports</a> to shore up supply (Reuters)</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98eadbcc-2eaf-4a05-a509-6d91dcbcb583\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>The Bundesbank warned that an embargo on <strong>Russian gas</strong> could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc767abf-6fa4-4e0c-943d-f582da3d033b\">cost the German economy €180bn</a>, reduce GDP for 2022 by 5 per cent and trigger a deep recession.

Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the value of tariffs and goods bans now totalled more than £1bn.</p> <p>Amid the UK economic gloom there was better news on the <strong>jobs market</strong>. Recruiter Hays said that wages for skilled workers were set to rise at the fastest rate since the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24f350ab-1f26-44e0-a27e-8ac44b052a6e\">collapse of Lehman Brothers</a>.</p> <p>The PMI reading for the <strong>eurozone</strong> showed a “two-speed economy” with services activity making up for a slowdown of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98eadbcc-2eaf-4a05-a509-6d91dcbcb583#post-ef3866fc-b17e-4728-85d0-228ed4b605db\">progress in manufacturing,</a> which was hit by rising costs and supply chain problems. The better than expected composite result of 55.8 was up from 54.9 in March.</p> <p>Ukrainian prime minister <strong>Denys Shmyhal</strong>, called in the FT for Russian sanctions to be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b6a2b9d-8dad-450d-b830-550ed8f080d1\">reinforced and updated</a>, especially on energy and commodities, and for the country's allies to provide financial aid as well as heavy weapons.

Fed governor <strong>Jay Powell </strong>signalled that interest rates could rise by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43d89b6e-c8c9-4ae3-b002-4e536c7f8935\">half a percentage point</a> at its May meeting.

The proportion of over 65s in China is forecast to increase more rapidly than other OECD countries, doubling from 10.6 per cent in 2017 to 26.3 per cent in 2050.

The FT editorial board said that the fight against Covid in the developing world had become a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09bfb504-6fa0-45cd-923a-27e46f68e899\">“parable of underachievement”</a> but had also led to the neglect of other, far longer established killers.</p> <p>Protests over the rising cost of living and against president Pedro Castillo are intensifying in <strong>Peru</strong>, including blocking of roads and railways, disrupting tourism and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f92c4f0c-b812-4dee-af4c-7ee740f9012a\">closing copper mines</a>.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p><strong>Wall Street banks</strong> are forging ahead with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab315e01-1175-4254-8918-538bf5aec8f7\">expansion plans in Shanghai</a>, even as the city's strict coronavirus lockdown disrupts current activities. “We're trying to build a 50-year business in China,” said a person familiar with plans from Goldman Sachs. “A disruption over several months isn't enough to shift the strategic thinking.”</p> <p><strong>Blackstone</strong>, the world's biggest alternative asset manager, said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8afdc2c7-97dd-472c-8811-a5e64280c155\">dealmaking would slow</a> this year because of high inflation, rising interest rates and political uncertainty, even as it reported the best quarter in its 36-year history.</p> <p>The EU is set to follow the Digital Markets Act with a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f39a8b61-c7b4-4674-9606-b923f63ad770\">new law</a> that for the first time sets rules on how <strong>Big Tech</strong> should keep users safe online.
