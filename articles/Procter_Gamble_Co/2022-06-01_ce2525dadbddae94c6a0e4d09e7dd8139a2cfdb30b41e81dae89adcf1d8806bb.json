But its chief executive <strong>Shalev Hulio </strong>had an idea to bring in more money: restart sales to risky customers. </p> <p>To do so it sought the support of <strong>Berkeley Research Group</strong>, a circumspect bunch of US-based consultants who'd replaced a group of private equity dealmakers as representatives of NSO's majority shareholder. </p> <p>BRG had come on to the scene in unusual circumstances, after investors in <strong>Novalpina Capital </strong>— the buyout group that bought NSO in 2019 — last year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d88518dd-7c66-48b2-b3e5-c765ebe720ab\">ousted Novalpina's three co-founders from managing </a>the fund they'd raised and put the consultancy firm in charge instead. That was prompted by a feud among the trio which led the investors to decide they could no longer work together. </p> <p>BRG rejected Hulio's suggestion as too risky. Missing debt repayments was risky too, Hulio quipped in response. </p> <p>The solution: BRG would make an immediate $10mn loan to an NSO subsidiary to avert the temporary crunch, while NSO attempted a pivot to selling to western allies of Israel. </p> <p>Weeks later, the US blacklisted NSO for selling Pegasus to countries that used it for “transnational repression”, effectively killing the pivot plan. </p> <p>That is the backdrop against which months of turmoil at one of the world's most controversial cyber companies has played out, as DD's Kaye Wiggins and Ortenca Aliaj and the FT's Mehul Srivastava and Demetri Sevastopulo report <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/5ef90e5f-1220-4ed6-a650-985272eb0334\">in this deep-dive</a>.</p> <p>NSO's next steps are unclear. One option is to separate its greatest assets — its code and engineers — from its greatest liabilities, the clients that have attracted controversy. The split would create a phoenix entity that would hope to sidestep the US blacklist. </p> <p>Things aren't always so intense, though. Hulio briefly DJ-ed at an NSO bash on Israel's Red Sea coast in November. </p> <p>BRG's loan has not yet been repaid. </p> <h2>Nelson Peltz takes his seat at Unilever</h2> <p>With its “New <strong>Axe</strong> Effect” campaign, the deodorant brand (known as<strong> Lynx</strong> in the UK) has launched an appeal for a fresh start. </p> <p>“We didn't always get it right in the past, but we are trying to move on from that,” the brand that has been accused of promoting a bygone trope of masculinity <a href=\"https://www.axe.com/us/en/our-values.html\">wrote</a>.</p> <p>Axe's parent company, consumer goods giant <strong>Unilever</strong>, could be in for a similar refresh now that <strong>Nelson Peltz</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7e72c63-9531-4d2b-9206-6e723dd1b3f0\">has joined its board</a>.</p> <p>The billionaire activist's new role comes after his hedge fund <strong>Trian Fund Management </strong>acquired a 1.5 per cent stake in the company, making it among the biggest shareholders in the maker of <strong>Magnum</strong> ice cream,<strong> Dove</strong> soap and <strong>Hellmann</strong>'s mayonnaise.</p> <p>Though it was first <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a17a6811-78a8-4eb7-a2be-adbb8eb75119\">revealed in January</a> that Trian had taken a stake in Unilever, speculation had been brewing in the City months before that Peltz — who had just spent four years confronting the “suffocating bureaucracy” at consumer goods rival <strong>Procter &amp; Gamble</strong> — would do the same at Unilever.</p> <p>Shareholder discontent hit a high note at the conglomerate earlier this year following news of Unilever's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a1d6f47-90e0-4639-aed7-3817d4c18ed0\">three failed approaches</a> to buy UK drugmaker <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong>'s consumer health business, landing its CEO <strong>Alan Jope</strong> in the crosshairs of angry investors who thought the whole fiasco underlined its weak share price performance.</p> <p>Shares in the company had fallen 16 per cent since Jope took over in 2019, before rising nearly 7 per cent on Tuesday following the board changes.</p> <p>It's still unclear how aggressive the changes Peltz intends to make at Unilever will be. One option, as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0494db5-c38b-45b9-b3e6-01cab87a9e23\">Alphaville points out</a>, would be to call upon Trian's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e5450d2-2be5-11df-8033-00144feabdc0\">playbook at chocolate maker <strong>Cadbury</strong></a> and push for a sale or demerger of Unilever's £50bn-ish valued food and drink division.</p> <p>That could indicate a clash in strategy with Jope, who previously stated there are “<a href=\"https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/mergers-and-acquisitions/back-to-the-drawing-board-what-does-unilever-do-now/663747.article\">no immediate plans</a>” for a spin-off. </p> <p>It wouldn't be the first time the two have disagreed. In one of their first and only meetings in late September, Peltz <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5644e85-b0f7-443d-a949-1ff7d5b33374\">met Jope for breakfast</a> at London's Claridge's with a bitter taste in his mouth over <strong>Ben &amp; Jerry's</strong> ice cream.</p> <p>The Unilever dessert brand had recently announced it would stop selling ice cream in the occupied Palestinian territories in an apparent protest against Israeli settlements. Peltz's verdict: no company should make such political statements.</p> <p>He isn't the first shareholder to oppose Unilever's messaging. The company's attempts to flaunt its sustainability credentials at the expense of running the business have caused it to “lose the plot”, <strong>Terry Smith</strong>, whose<strong> Fundsmith </strong>is a top-10 Unilever stakeholder, argued following the thwarted bids for GSK.</p> <p>Peltz's stint at Unilever will probably be a smoother one than at P&amp;G, where he waged a bitter proxy battle, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0494db5-c38b-45b9-b3e6-01cab87a9e23\">Lex notes</a>. </p> <p>Whether the activist and Jope can work out their differences over a few pints of Cherry Garcia is another thing.</p> <h2>DSM follows its nose from coal mines to consumer chemicals</h2> <p><strong>DSM</strong> saw the canaries flapping round its coal mines more than a decade ago.</p> <p>The company founded as <strong>Dutch State Mines </strong>has been working to break free from its industrial roots into life sciences since pawning off its petrochemicals business in 2002. </p> <p>Its latest deals are meant to complete its transformation into consumer nutrition products. It is<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5d7694a-d69b-4083-b4f9-f6374a46bd14\"> taking over</a> the Swiss flavouring and fragrance group <strong>Firmenich</strong>, the so-called<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da7b86a3-a8a7-4a0b-a26f-38abda7e7f86\"> “Silicon Valley of smell”</a>, in a cash and shares deal worth €19bn including net debt, and shedding its engineering materials unit for €3.5bn. </p> <p>The company says its name now more closely reflects the acronym “Doing Something Meaningful”.</p> <p>DSM shareholders will control two-thirds of the newly formed company's equity. DSM leadership will take the chair and chief executive roles. But clearly sensitivities are high as Firmenich chief executive <strong>Gilbert Ghostine</strong>, who doesn't have a role in the new group, insisted the deal was a “merger of equals”, which it is not.</p> <p>The combination will form the largest maker of fragrances, propelling DSM's ambitions to corner the vegan food and meat market as consumers increasingly demand plant-based products that look, smell and taste like the real thing.</p> <p>It's the largest deal in the sector since <strong>International Flavor &amp; Fragrances </strong>bought <strong>DuPont</strong>'s nutrition business in 2019 for $26.2bn, drawing in dealmakers from <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>BDT </strong>for Firmenich and <strong>Centerview Partners</strong> and <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> for DSM.</p> <p>Private equity firm <strong>Advent International </strong>has smelt opportunity of its own, going in on DSM's remaining legacy industrial arm with German chemicals group<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/LXS:GR\"><strong> Lanxess</strong></a> for an enterprise value of €3.85bn.</p> <p>While its latest transactions promise cost savings to investors,<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/615bb955-f674-494f-8832-0434c47bb3bc\"> as Lex notes</a>, DSM's ability to weather the competition in the fast-consolidating consumer chemicals industry will now be front and centre as it leaves its industrial past behind.</p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <p>The UK government <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cae389fa-8627-4188-9054-ecceae7bffb5\">has selected</a> former<strong> Boston Consulting Group </strong>partner<strong> Marcus Bokkerink</strong> to chair the UK competition regulator after a heavily delayed two-year process that has thrown succession planning at the watchdog into disarray.</p> <p><strong>Smart reads</strong></p> <p><strong>Culture shock </strong>Saudi Arabia is eager to recruit top talent to work on futuristic development projects such as the country's future smart city and innovation hub Neom and help lessen its dependence on oil.
