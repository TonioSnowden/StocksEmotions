  "text": "<p>PepsiCo, the company behind brands including Doritos chips, Quaker Oats oatmeal and its Mountain Dew and namesake sodas, said the higher prices are helping it offset cost increases.</p><p>On Wednesday, the company said for the quarter ended Sept. 3, organic sales, which strip out currency effects, acquisitions and divestitures, rose 16% from a year earlier. All of the gains came from the 17% average price increase. In the June quarter, PepsiCo's prices were up 12% on average from a year earlier.</p><p>Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta told analysts on a conference call that PepsiCo is reducing promotions and focusing on formats where consumers are less sensitive to price to help boost revenue.</p><p>\"The consumer has very much stuck with our products,\" said Hugh Johnston, PepsiCo's finance chief. \"In a world where there are many struggles and stresses, we are kind of an affordable luxury.\"</p><p>The higher prices, and what Mr. Johnston said has been a better-than-expected consumer reaction to them, are a key reason why PepsiCo again lifted its outlook for sales growth for the year. It now expects organic sales to rise 12% this year, double the original forecast at the outset of the year. The company raised its profit forecast, too.</p><p>The results and raised outlook helped lift the share prices of consumer-products companies such as Coca-Cola Co., Clorox Co. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. on Wednesday. Some investors have been bracing for earnings reports from large companies to show signs of strains from elevated costs, blows to demand and strength in the dollar.</p><p>Shares in PepsiCo gained 4.2% to $169.39. The company's shares are down 2% this year, compared with a 25% decline in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Digital marketplace Etsy Inc., wine and spirits maker Brown-Forman Corp. and makeup company Estee Lauder Cos. are among companies where executives in recent months have touted their products being able to withstand shifts in consumer spending. \"We use the term affordable luxury a lot, and I do think spirits is an affordable luxury where consumers, they prioritize that bottle of Jack Daniel's,\" said Brown-Forman Chief Executive Lawson Whiting on an earnings conference call with analysts in August.</p><p>Consumers have pulled back on spending as a result of persistent inflation.</p>",
