  "title": "Chanel Finds Its CEO  Outside of Fashion  Industry, at Unilever  ----  By Trefor Moss",
  "text": "<p>   LONDON -- French luxury group Chanel SA poached consumer-goods executive Leena Nair to become its chief executive, reaching outside the fashion market for leadership as it strives to recover from the industry's pandemic slump. </p><p>   Ms. Nair has been head of human resources at consumer-goods and packaged-food giant Unilever PLC. </p><p>   Alain Wertheimer, who owns privately held Chanel with his brother Gerard, will move from the CEO role to executive chairman early next year, Chanel said. </p><p>   It's rare for luxury companies to hire top executives from outside the industry, which has traditionally favored insiders or -- in the case of the many family-run fashion houses -- scions of the business founders. One notable exception: Estee Lauder Cos. tapped Fabrizio Freda, a snack-food executive at Procter &amp; Gamble Co., to become its chief executive in 2009. </p><p>   Ms. Nair joins a sector that analysts say is poised for rapid post-pandemic growth. Bain &amp; Co. forecasts that global luxury revenues will rise from an estimated 283 billion euros, equivalent to $320 billion, this year to around 370 billion euros, or $418 billion, in 2025. </p><p>   Chanel, whose lines include fashion, fragrances, jewelry and skin care, was the world's sixth largest luxury group by revenue in 2020, according to Deloitte, with sales of $10.1 billion. </p><p>   Like other big luxury groups, Chanel's sales took a hit from the pandemic, declining 17.6% in 2020 from the year before. That compared with an 11% decline for LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and a 17.5% drop at Kering SA. </p><p>   Ms. Nair -- who has spent three decades at Unilever -- will be based in London, where Chanel has had its global headquarters since 2018. </p><p></p>",
