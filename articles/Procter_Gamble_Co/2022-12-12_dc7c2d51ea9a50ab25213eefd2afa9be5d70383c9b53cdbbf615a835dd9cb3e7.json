  "text": "<p>Mr. Erceg most recently served as executive vice president and CFO at Cerner, a Kansas City, Mo.-based company that was acquired by business-software firm Oracle Corp. earlier this year. He has held that role since February 2021.</p><p>Newell in May named its current CFO, Chris Peterson, to the additional post of president, following the example set by some other large U.S. companies that in recent months have given their finance chiefs additional titles and responsibilities. The company said Mr. Peterson will fully transition into the role of president upon Mr. Erceg's arrival.</p><p>\"I am confident that he and Chris will be a powerful combination to drive profitable growth, improve operational excellence, while reducing complexity and optimizing cash flow,\" Ravi Saligram, Newell's chief executive officer, said in a statement. Newell declined to comment further.</p><p>The company in October said its largest U.S. retailers have sharply cut product orders, which could cause them to run short on inventory for the holiday season and its own sales to fall.</p><p>Newell reported its sales fell about 19% to $2.25 billion for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with the prior-year period. The company posted $31 million in net income for the period, down from $190 million a year earlier, in part due to an impairment charge for goodwill—which is created when one company acquires another for more than the value of its hard assets—and intangible assets.</p><p>Newell in recent months has worked to consolidate 23 supply chains, including combining ordering, fulfillment and sales policies for its various brands into a single legal entity.</p><p>Newell also has stepped up investments in its distribution centers to increase its reliance on East Coast ports and cut down its shipping distances to customers in the eastern U.S.</p><p>Before Cerner, Mr. Erceg held CFO roles at luxury-goods retailer Tiffany &amp; Co., rail-services provider Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. and door maker Masonite International Corp. He also spent 18 years at consumer-products giant Procter &amp; Gamble Co., including as general manager for global investor relations.</p><p>In his new role, Mr. Erceg is set to receive an annual base salary of $800,000 and a cash bonus with a target payout equal to 120% of his annual salary, a filing showed. He will also receive long-term incentives with a total target value of $3.6 million, or 450% of his annual salary.</p><p>Write to Mark Maurer at mark.maurer@wsj.com and Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com</p><p>Newell Brands Hires New Finance Chief as It Looks to Improve Efficiency</p>",
