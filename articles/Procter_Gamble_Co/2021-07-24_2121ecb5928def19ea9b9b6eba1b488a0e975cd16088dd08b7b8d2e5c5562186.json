  "text": "<p>   The maker of Huggies diapers and Cottonelle toilet paper said it expects to charge higher prices through 2022 in an effort to offset rising costs. </p><p>   Kimberly-Clark Corp. on Friday reported its second-straight quarterly sales decline as well-stocked Americans bought less toilet paper and paper towels in a largely reopened economy. </p><p>   Organic sales, a measure that strips out currency effects and deals, fell again, down 3%. Rising materials costs sliced profit and margins for the second quarter. Earnings fell more than 40%, worse than Wall Street anticipated. </p><p>   Americans are cutting back on pandemic staples, from paper towels to cleaning wipes, just as product makers face soaring costs. </p><p>   \"Clearly our results did not turn out as expected,\" Kimberly-Clark Chief Executive Mike Hsu said Friday in a call with analysts. Mr. Hsu said he expects to fully offset cost increases with higher prices the rest of this year and in 2022. </p><p>   Consumer-goods makers Clorox Co. and Colgate Palmolive Co., which will report results in coming days, face similar troubles, according to analysts and sales data. </p><p>   Of the major players, only Procter &amp; Gamble Co. appears on track for a solid, albeit more modest, quarterly performance. The company is aided by a broader lineup less reliant on cleaning and quarantine-driven demand, while also benefiting from a pre-pandemic restructuring. P&amp;G previously announced plans to raise prices on baby products, adult diapers and feminine-care brands starting in September. </p><p>   Individuals and retailers stocked up on toilet paper and paper towels at the height of the coronavirus pandemic last year ahead of lockdowns. </p><p>   Now, people are using less toilet paper and paper towels at home and are still working through their stockpiles -- as are retailers. Demand also is falling for cleaning products and other household-care items that were in hot demand as people stayed home and focused intensely on hygiene. </p><p>   Kimberly-Clark's home-care unit's organic sales fell 17% compared with last year's second quarter when Americans were loading up on paper towels and toilet paper. Organic sales rose 6% for the company's personal-care unit and 2% in its commercial business. </p><p>   Net income, hit by rising materials costs,  fell to $410 million from $692 million. Finance chief Maria Henry said this year is expected to deliver the biggest increase in materials costs in the company's history. </p><p>   The company lowered its forecast for the year. Organic sales are pegged between flat and down 2%, compared with the prior prediction of flat to a 1% increase. Operating profit is expected to fall by 11% to 14%. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Dave Sebastian contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
