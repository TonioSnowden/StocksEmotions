  "title": "Microsoft Earnings Rose Last Quarter With Demand for Cloud Services; Software company's businesses continued to benefit from the shift to remote work during the pandemic",
  "text": "<p>Following the earnings release, Microsoft shares were little changed in early after-hours trading.</p><p>Through the pandemic, Microsoft and other business-software companies experienced booming stock prices and sales as organizations around the world used more digital tools to help with remote working. This has bolstered demand for Microsoft's office applications as well as its cloud-infrastructure services.</p><p>\"Continued customer commitment to our cloud platform and strong sales execution drove better-than-expected commercial bookings growth,\" Amy Hood, Microsoft's chief financial officer said in a statement.</p><p>Microsoft remains the second-largest cloud-infrastructure vendor behind Amazon.com Inc., but the company has been gaining market share by using its leadership in office applications as leverage to grab big deals for its Azure cloud. It had nearly 20% of the market in 2020, according to research firm Gartner Inc.â€”well behind Amazon Web Services' 40%, but up from 7% in 2016.</p><p>The company's overall cloud business was up 32% with $23.4 billion in sales as its rival to Amazon cloud infrastructure service grew 46%.</p><p>Analysts and investors have been looking for signs that demand is cooling. Software shares have been sliding this year, with Microsoft down around 20%, in line with the Nasdaq Composite Index.</p><p>Microsoft's cloud-market push has come under criticism in Europe, where rivals have filed antitrust complaints. Last summer, French company OVHcloud filed one over licensing terms that it says make Microsoft products more expensive to use on non-Microsoft clouds.</p><p>A Microsoft spokesman said in response to the complaint that it is continuously evaluating how it can best work with partners.</p><p>Microsoft has had a busy year. In January, it announced its biggest-ever acquisition with its $75 billion offer for Activision Blizzard Inc., developer of such popular videogame franchises as Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. The deal is expected to bolster Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service, which offers a library of games for a monthly fee.</p><p>The videogame arm generated close to 10% of Microsoft's revenue in 2021. The company is trying to build it into another core business, by using its cloud infrastructure to take the lead in an emerging cloud-gaming sector.</p><p>Microsoft's total gaming revenue grew 6% for the quarter, while its Xbox content and services sales advanced 4%. Its console sales for the quarter increased 14%.</p><p>Microsoft doesn't expect the Activision deal, being reviewed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, to close until next year. New Chairwoman Lina Khan has taken steps to increase scrutiny of deals. If it does close, Microsoft said it would become the third-largest gaming company by sales, with 30 game studios under its management.</p><p>Write to Aaron Tilley at aaron.tilley@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft Earnings Rose Last Quarter With Demand for Cloud Services</p>",
