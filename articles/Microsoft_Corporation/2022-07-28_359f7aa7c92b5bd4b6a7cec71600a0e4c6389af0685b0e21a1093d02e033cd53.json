  "text": "<p>The U.S. central bank lifted its federal-funds rate by 0.75 percentage point, to a range between 2.25% and 2.5%, and said in a statement it is \"strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2% objective.\"</p><p>\"The Fed is prepared to continue until they have price stability in lowering inflationary expectations,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. \"That's what the market wants. Inflation remains and the question now is how fast is it pulling back.\"</p><p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters he doesn't think the U.S. is in a recession. \"Two-point-seven million people hired in the first half of the year -- it doesn't make sense that the economy would be in recession,\" Mr. Powell said.</p><p>Stocks rallied earlier on Wednesday after megacap technology companies Microsoft Corp. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. reported earnings that were better than investors feared.</p><p>\"The market is bearishly positioned,\" said Tim Leary, a high-yield bond portfolio manager for RBC Global Asset Management. \"Trading volumes have been thin. You get a whiff of good news, and it doesn't take much to have a market rally.\"</p><p>It is a pivotal and busy week in financial markets, and traders around the world were studying the interest-rate decision from the Fed.</p><p>Investors have been watching closely for any clues from central bankers on the size of further interest-rate increases this year -- and whether officials expect to then turn around and begin cutting rates next year.</p><p>In a policy statement, Fed officials acknowledged signs of slower economic activity. Mr. Powell said it would likely become appropriate to slow the pace of interest-rate hikes.</p><p>The U.S. stock market has performed well on days when the Fed has raised rates this year, Bespoke Investment Group noted Tuesday. Wednesday's 0.75-percentage-point increase marked the Fed's second consecutive increase of that magnitude this year. The Fed hasn't lifted rates that quickly since the 1980s.</p><p>\"We want to hear what Powell is thinking about the inflation outlook and what he is thinking about the growth outlook,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors. \"But we have to be careful. We've learned in the last couple of months that we can't read too much into any broad guidance.\"</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged down to 2.731%, from 2.786% Tuesday. Yields rise when bond prices fall. The yield on the two-year note, meanwhile, slipped to 2.968%, from 3.041% the day before.</p><p>Short-term yields have been elevated this year as investors prepared for the Fed to keep aggressively raising interest rates, keeping the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted. That signal is often seen as a key recession predictor.</p><p>Stocks are on track to close July with gains, though many investors don't expect them to be long-lasting.</p><p>\"It doesn't mean that a recession isn't going to happen within the next couple of quarters,\" Ms. Shah said. \"This is your ultimate bear-market rally.\"</p><p>Investors have grown increasingly worried that the Fed could plunge the U.S. into a recession through tighter policy. Second-quarter gross-domestic product data on Thursday will provide insight into the economy's recent performance.</p><p>Investors are also monitoring earnings results this week, the busiest of the earnings season, for clues about how companies are navigating decades-high inflation.</p><p>In earnings Wednesday, Shopify Inc. warned it expects higher inflation and rising rates to pressure consumers' wallets, and noted that the strength of the U.S. dollar weighed on results. The company reported a loss in the second quarter. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that the Shopify is cutting 10% of its global workforce. Shopify rose $3.69, or 12%, to $35.24, a day after falling 14%.</p><p>Sherwin-Williams Co. fell $22.32, or 8.8%, to $231.97 after it reported a profit decline amid lower-than-expected sales. Spotify Technology SA shares climbed $12.64, or 12%, to $116.61 after the music-streaming giant reported accelerated user growth and a rise in advertising revenue for the second quarter.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 0.5%. At midday Thursday in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.4%, while South Korea's Kospi had gained 1%. Japan's Nikkei 225 had risen 0.3%.</p>",
