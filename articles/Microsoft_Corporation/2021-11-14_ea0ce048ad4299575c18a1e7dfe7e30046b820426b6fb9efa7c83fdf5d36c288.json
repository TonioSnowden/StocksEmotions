  "title": "COP26 Opens Path to International Carbon Trading; A U.N.-certified carbon credit could be used by regulated markets and standardize more informal ones",
  "text": "<p>\"It is unquestionably good news that an agreement has been reached that allows everyone to move forward,\" said Thomas Lingard, global climate &amp; environment director at Unilever PLC.</p><p>One aspect of the deal is aimed at creating a U.N.-certified credit that can be accounted for around the world. A standardized credit should allow governments to access regulated and more informal carbon markets that already exist and are used widely by companies. A government that can't meet the emissions plans it submitted to the U.N. can buy credits in these markets to make up the difference.</p><p>\"The rules help to define the framework for how governments can use the private sector to support them in meeting their climate targets,\" said Enric Arderiu Serra, head of environmental products at Mercuria Energy Trading SA</p><p>Uncertainties around carbon accounting has slowed the expansion of these markets, said Dirk Forrister, president of the International Emissions Trading Association, a trade group. \"The Glasgow market framework can unleash a whole new wave of investment as companies leverage the trading tools,\" Mr. Forrister said.</p><p>The rules are part of what has been called Article 6 of the Paris Accord, which was signed in 2015. Ever since, governments have squabbled over them. A deal has faltered in past summits, amid fighting about what could be considered double counting of the same credit by countries. Another stumbling block has been whether to allow countries to use older credits, from a now-defunct earlier trading system.</p><p>A global carbon market won't happen overnight. The agreement first invites nominations for a supervisory body to oversee the marketplace. Once that body is selected, it is slated to meet at least twice next year to develop the technical methodologies, registration and monitoring processes needed.</p><p>Currently, there is a patchwork of carbon markets globally. These include markets which are set up and regulated by governments such as the European Union's Emissions Trading System and similar markets in China and California. In these markets, heavy emitting industries such as utilities are given limits for how much carbon they can emit. If they stay under that limit, they can sell the extra to others who are emitting more than their ceiling. The new rules could lead to the linking up of regional emissions trading programs.</p><p>Parallel to these regulated markets are more informal carbon-offset markets, where companies participate voluntarily in activities like planting trees and restoring peatlands, or funding others to do so. These projects generate credits that can be traded among companies to drive down their own net emissions—something regulators, investors and consumers are increasingly calling for.</p><p>Many companies already buy carbon-offset credits, including Microsoft Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Nestlé SA. These offset credits can be certified by third parties who record the projects and credits and confirm they meet certain standards.</p><p>The U.N. plan would provide a framework to harmonize all these markets under generally accepted standards, for instance, about what sort of projects qualify for credits and how much carbon they offset. Critics of the informal markets that many companies use complain they aren't consistent in terms of standards.</p><p>Microsoft, noting the inconsistency of how offsets are verified, last year developed its own due-diligence process to ascertain that credits it was trading were of a certain standard.</p><p>\"At its best, Article 6 has the potential to be an important driver of carbon finance, clean energy, and carbon removal,\" said Elizabeth Willmott, carbon program director at Microsoft.</p><p>Sha Hua contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Sarah McFarlane at sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com</p><p>COP26 Opens Path to International Carbon Trading</p>",
