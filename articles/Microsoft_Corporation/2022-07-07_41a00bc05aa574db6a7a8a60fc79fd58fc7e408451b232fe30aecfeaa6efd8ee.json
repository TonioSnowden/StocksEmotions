  "title": "Get a Bigger Tax Deduction for the Miles You Drive for Work; The IRS raised the standard mileage rate for the self-employed to 62.5 cents on July 1, but it is possible to get an even better break",
  "text": "<p>For self-employed taxpayers who drive for work, claiming the standard mileage tax deduction is easy. You log business miles driven and multiply the miles by the IRS-set standard mileage rate to calculate your deduction. The more you drive, the more you save. If you drive 10,000 miles in the second half of 2022, for example, you would get a $6,250 deduction. But for those willing to do a little more record-keeping, it is possible to get an even bigger deduction.</p><p>The mileage deduction is intended to cover more than just the cost of gas. Say your car gets 25 miles a gallon. With gas at $5 a gallon, that is 20 cents a mile. So a 62.5 cents mileage rate sounds great, but it is a composite index of factors including maintenance and wear and tear on your vehicle. Your actual costs could be different and save you more.</p><p>How do you get the most out of the actual costs deduction?</p><p>Business owners and independent contractors who are road warriors can often do better by skipping the standard mileage rate and deducting their actual car expenses. With this method, you total your expenses each year, prorate them if you use your car for business and personal trips, and you get to take a separate depreciation deduction. There is a laundry list of what counts toward operating expenses: gas, oil changes, tires, repairs, insurance, property taxes, even detailing.</p><p>Tiffany Marcelle, a real-estate agent in Dallas, says she was unaware of the actual expenses method when she logged her first 8,800 miles on the job driving her 2014 Cadillac ATS in 2019. George Dandridge Jr., her tax adviser, explained it would dramatically increase her deduction. If she had used the standard mileage rate of 58 cents a mile at the time, her deduction would have been $5,104. But by using the actual expenses method, it came to $5,837. Plus, she was able to take an additional special depreciation deduction of $13,267. Depreciation is baked into the standard method, but Mrs. Marcelle was now able to make additional deductions of $14,960 more than the standard mileage deduction, says Mr. Dandridge, a McKinney, Texas-based enrolled agent.</p><p>Which method is better?</p><p>It depends. Calculate your miles using the standard method. Then add up your actual costs to see if they yield a bigger break. Timing matters. If you know you're going to get a new car in a year or two, the standard mileage deduction might make more sense, Mr. Dandridge says. If you're getting a new car in the near future or if you have an old car with a lot of repairs, you'll probably want to take depreciation and the actual expenses deduction.</p><p>Mrs. Marcelle racked up 105,000 miles on her 2014 Cadillac ATS, so she upgraded to a new Cadillac XT6, which she started driving for work this year. She'll get another big break when she files her 2022 taxes: a special depreciation allowance for the new car, coupled with the actual expenses deduction.</p><p>One downside: She'll have to recapture two years of depreciation on her old car because she sold it within five years. That is the kind of aggravation that makes people stick with the standard mileage deduction. But to get the biggest possible tax break, it pays to calculate it both ways.</p><p>What records do you need to keep?</p><p>Most people will just keep a mileage log, and they aren't aware of the actual expenses deduction—and the additional record-keeping needed to claim it. Mrs. Marcelle says she keeps records on an Excel spreadsheet that she updates weekly. Mileage tracking apps like Microsoft's MileIQ are another option.</p><p>The IRS can disallow any deduction that isn't documented. For the standard mileage rate deduction, mileage logs need to include the day, miles driven, and the business purpose of the trip. For the actual expenses method, more records are required, including receipts for expenses and the calculation showing the business use percentage—the amount you drive for business versus personal use.</p><p>Where to report the deduction on your 1040. Whether you claim the standard mileage deduction or the actual expenses deduction, they are both reported on Line 9 on Schedule C of your 1040 tax return.</p><p>Parking fees and tolls attributable to business use are separately deductible on your Schedule C form, whether you use the standard mileage rate or actual expenses.</p><p>Changing methods. If you start with the actual expenses method in year one, you have to stick with it for the life of the car. If you start with the standard mileage rate method, you can switch to the actual expenses method.</p><p>Have an EV? You can still snag the deduction, using either calculation. There is no separate IRS mileage rate for EVs or hybrids, meaning EV owners get the full benefit without having to pay for gas.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How does the mileage tax break work for you?
