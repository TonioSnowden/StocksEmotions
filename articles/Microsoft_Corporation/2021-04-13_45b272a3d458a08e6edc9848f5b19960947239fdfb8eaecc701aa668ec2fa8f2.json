  "text": "<p>Grab, south-east Asia's most valuable start-up, has agreed to the largest-ever merger with a special purpose acquisition company, raising $4.5bn in cash to go public in a US deal that will value its shares at close to $40bn.</p> <p>SoftBank-backed Grab was founded in 2012 as the region's answer to Uber and morphed into a “super app” that provided everything from food delivery to digital payments. It will combine with a New York-listed Spac launched by Altimeter, a Silicon Valley group known for its backing of late-stage technology companies.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73d8b26c-3d61-48ec-8027-25c4cd625488\">deal</a>, which marks a significant moment for south-east Asian start-ups as well as the booming market for Spacs, shatters the record for the largest merger by a blank-cheque vehicle as hundreds of competing entities search for private targets.&#xa0;</p> <p>Bankers and other participants in Spac transactions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/321400c1-9c4d-40ac-b464-3a64c1c4ca80\">have warned</a> that the market has overheated, as sources of fresh capital to back mergers dry up and US securities regulators scrutinise Spacs and their deals more closely.&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41b26841-b88d-4f9d-9da2-b1b8f2c6c734\">Anthony Tan, Grab's chief executive and co-founder</a>, called the deal a “proud moment” for south-east Asia and said it had put Grab and the region's tech industry on the map.</p> <p>In addition to approximately $500m in proceeds from the Altimeter Growth Corp Spac, Grab will raise more than $4bn in fresh funding, which will be led by a $750m cash injection from Altimeter.</p> <p>Other funds investing in the deal include BlackRock, T Rowe Price, Fidelity, Janus Henderson, Abu Dhabi's Mubadala, Singapore's Temasek as well as a number of wealthy Indonesian family offices.</p> <p>“We have been able to close a record amount&#xa0;with arguably the world's best investors,” Tan said, referring to the more than $4bn in new funding.</p> <p>Tan said the group considered both a traditional listing and a Spac merger and the latter made the most sense for the company, particularly the ability to attract more long-term investors. Altimeter has committed to a three-year lock-up period. </p> <p>Grab did not rule out a secondary listing on one of south-east Asia's local bourses. </p> <p>The company, which is not yet profitable, has grown strongly during the pandemic and was last valued at $16bn in a private fundraising, making it the biggest technology start-up in south-east Asia.&#xa0;</p> <p>Grab has already received backing from big-name investors. As well as Japan's SoftBank, which first invested in 2014, Uber is also a big shareholder. The US company sold its south-east Asia operations to Grab and received a stake in 2018. Other investors include Tiger Global Management, Mitsubishi&#xa0;UFJ Financial Group, GGV and Microsoft.</p> <p>The Singapore-based group reported a gross merchandise value — a metric measuring total sales transactions on its platform — of $12.5bn in 2020, surpassing pre-pandemic levels and more than doubling from 2018. Its ride-hailing business breaks even in all of its markets but its financial and deliveries arms are not yet profitable.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Credit rating agencies Moody's and S&amp;P this year assigned their first ratings on Grab. Moody's does not expect the company to break even until 2023 owing to its cash burn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Ivana Naumovska, professor of entrepreneurship at Insead researching Spacs, said that while the rise in Altimeter Growth's Nasdaq-listed stock in recent days suggested investors were bullish about the merger, Grab “faces a challenge of getting ready for the public market within a short timeline”. </p> <p>The deal requires information including non-trivial accounting, reporting, and governance considerations, “which can lead to irregularities” if not filed properly, she said.&#xa0;</p> <p>Grab's lossmaking business is a further consideration, she added. “Being a publicly listed company means . . . performance pressures will increase.”</p> <p>Brad Gerstner, Altimeter's founder and chief executive, said Grab was “paving a digital path” for south-east Asia's 670m people. He noted that online penetration for the services Grab offered was well below that of the US, despite its larger population.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Grab expects its total addressable market to grow to $180bn by 2025, compared to $52bn in 2020,” Gerstner said.</p><p>Source: Mercedes Ruehl and Stefania Palma in Singapore and Arash Massoudi in London 2021 'Singapore's Grab to go public in $40bn Spac deal' FT.com 13 April.
