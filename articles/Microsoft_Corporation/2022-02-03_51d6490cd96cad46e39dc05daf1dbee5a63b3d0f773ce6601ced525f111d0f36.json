  "text": "<p>Christmas shopping season is over but Nintendo Switch consoles are still in short supply. The Japanese gaming company cut its Switch sales outlook for the second straight quarter on Thursday as it struggles with component shortages. But the Japanese games giant faces a bigger challenge. Cash-rich US tech groups are seizing more of an industry increasingly seen as key to digital dominance. </p> <p>The global gaming market has ballooned in recent years. Graphics are sharper, physics are convincing and a faster internet facilitates connected gaming. The experience is more like participating in an action movie than playing clunky old arcade-style games. </p> <p>The pandemic has given growth a further boost. Revenues exceeded $180bn in 2021, surpassing the global film industry and nearing the world TV business in size. Recent data suggest gaming revenues will exceed $300bn in the next five years. </p> <p>Nintendo stands to gain from the market's growing size and influence. It is a frontrunner in the sector's shift to the metaverse and augmented reality. Its cartoon fantasy game <em>Animal Crossing</em> — complete with a Turnip Exchange for trading types — is a blueprint for a metaverse. The hit mobile game <em>Pokémon Go</em>, released in 2016, points to how augmented reality can work. Nintendo has earmarked ¥100bn to develop its own games, allowing it to stay away from the sector's expensive race to acquire game developers and content. </p> <p>Yet Nintendo shares are down more than 18 per cent from a June peak, highlighting more pressing concerns. A drop in console sales affects Nintendo much more than rivals such as Sony or Microsoft. The group relies on consoles and games for 97 per cent of total revenues. It expects to sell 23mn Switch units in the fiscal year ending in March, down from 24mn previously, putting a ceiling on earnings growth. Over the past nine months, sales of Switch consoles fell 21 per cent. The stock trades at 17 times forward earnings, a discount to console-making peers Microsoft and Sony.</p> <p>Despite a lead in some cutting-edge trends, Nintendo has been behind in the move to live and mobile games widely embraced by Asian customers. These games accounted for nearly 60 per cent of 2020 sector revenues. They represented just 3 per cent of Nintendo's total sales. The group has great intellectual properties. But unless it modernises distribution, it will get left behind on the hard shoulder of world tech.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Nintendo/games industry: Mario needs more pipes' FT.com 3 February.
