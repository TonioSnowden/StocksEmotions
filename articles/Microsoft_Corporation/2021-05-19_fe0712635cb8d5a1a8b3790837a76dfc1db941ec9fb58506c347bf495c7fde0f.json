  "title": "Business News:  Bill Gates Transfers  Deere Shares to Wife  ----  By Theo Francis",
  "text": "<p>   Bill Gates has transferred more than $850 million in shares of Deere &amp; Co. to Melinda French Gates, bringing the total value of publicly disclosed transfers to more than $3 billion since the couple filed for divorce on May 3. </p><p>   The 2.25 million shares, about 7% of Mr. Gates's stake in the Moline, Ill., equipment manufacturer, were transferred on Thursday and reported late Friday evening by the billionaire and his investment vehicle, Cascade Investment LLC. The filing said Mr. Gates received no consideration for the shares. </p><p>   In the securities filing, Mr. Gates indicated he made the disclosure because he and Cascade control more than the 10% stake that triggers a reporting requirement. After the transfer, Mr. Gates and Cascade still owned nearly 29.3 million shares, or 9.3% of the company, they reported. </p><p>   A spokesman for Cascade declined to comment beyond the filings. Mr. Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft Corp., resigned from its board last spring amid a probe into his prior romantic relationship with a female Microsoft employee. </p><p>   This month, Mr. Gates transferred stakes in a Coca-Cola bottler, a Canadian railroad, AutoNation Inc. and other companies valued at nearly $2.4 billion to Ms. French Gates, as two of the world's richest people began dividing their wealth. </p><p></p>",
