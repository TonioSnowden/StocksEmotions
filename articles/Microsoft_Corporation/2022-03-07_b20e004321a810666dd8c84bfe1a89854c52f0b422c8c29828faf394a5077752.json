  "text": "<p>“In light of Russia's new ‘fake news' law, we have no choice but to suspend livestreaming and new content to our video service while we review the safety implications of this law. Our in-app messaging service will not be affected,” TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, said in a tweet Sunday.</p><p>On Friday, Russia passed a new law that could result in prison time for anyone disseminating what authorities deem false information about the war in Ukraine. News organizations such as CNN, the BBC and Bloomberg suspended operations in the country for their reporters' safety, and Russia cut off access to Meta Platform Inc.'s FB Facebook and Twitter Inc. TWTR.</p><p>On Sunday, American Express AXP joined Visa Inc. V and MasterCard Inc. MA in shutting down operations in Russia and Belarus, citing the invasion. That means AmEx cards will no longer work at Russian merchants or ATMs, and cards issued by Russian banks on the American Express global system will no longer work outside the country.</p><p>Read more:Visa, Mastercard say they will suspend Russia operations</p><p>“One of our company values is to ‘Do What is Right.'
