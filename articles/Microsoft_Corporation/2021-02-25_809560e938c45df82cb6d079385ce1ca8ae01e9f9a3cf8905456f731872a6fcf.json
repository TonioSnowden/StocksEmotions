Now, there is real anger — and some heavyweight companies are <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/aba984af-9c8a-4417-9d9c-9067f5e38ea1\">preparing for a battle royale</a>.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4025f44-caec-4195-8f3b-2cd8c15e5db4\">a complex deal</a>, a shell company sponsored by <strong>HPS Investment Partners</strong> intends to merge with two of Wall Street biggest recent success stories.&#xa0;</p> <p>One of them, Dyal, has in the past decade become the partner of choice for big-name private equity groups looking to sell stakes in their business; it has snapped up pieces of <strong>Silver Lake</strong> and <strong>Vista</strong>, at huge valuations.</p> <p>The other, Owl Rock, is an up-and-coming direct lender — which puts it in competition with a number of companies that have sold stakes to Dyal.&#xa0;</p> <p>Two of Owl Rock's rivals think the fit is outrageous. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c18c044-dfe2-459b-bc9e-36d9d165daf3\"><strong>Sixth Street Partners</strong></a> and <strong>Golub Capital</strong> have in the past week taken their claims of betrayal to court.&#xa0;</p> <p>Both believe that the merged group, to be called<strong> Blue Owl</strong>, will be an arch-competitor of theirs — and worse, a competitor that will be privy to some of their most intimate secrets. And they argue that their contracts with Dyal give them the right to stop the Spac deal.</p> <p>Naturally, Dyal, founded by former <strong>Lehman Brothers</strong> bankers <strong>Michael Rees</strong> and<strong> Sean Ward</strong>, disagrees. It will contest the lawsuits, which have been filed in state courts in Delaware and New York.</p> <p>The deal valued Blue Owl at a juicy $12.5bn, putting it in the league of the likes of<strong> Ares Management</strong> and <strong>Carlyle Group</strong>. It's also a sweet deal for Dyal's owner, asset manager <strong>Neuberger Berman</strong>. Neuberger, also once a part of the Lehman empire, is to net more than $1bn in proceeds — while remaining a large holder of Blue Owl.&#xa0;</p> <p>That payout depends, of course, on the deal closing. Now, litigation in two jurisdictions has muddled the path forward — and some of the most secretive and powerful financial groups in the world may soon be airing their dirty laundry in court.&#xa0;</p> <h2>McKinsey's Sneader packs his things</h2> <p>Well, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d159f32c-d2f4-465f-8280-313ab78eaed4\">we warned you</a> things were going to get ugly at McKinsey.&#xa0;</p> <p>The consultancy's global managing partner <strong>Kevin Sneader </strong>has been voted out by its 650 senior partners, in a historic rebuke over his handling of a string of crises, according to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8923cfde-8a29-4d40-a214-57f6620ac019\">this scoop</a> from DD's Arash Massoudi and the FT's Andrew Hill and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson.</p> <p>That means the top job could fall to <strong>Bob Sternfels</strong> or<strong> Sven Smit</strong>, two senior partners based in San Francisco and Amsterdam respectively, who have made it through to the last round of the leadership election. A final vote is expected in the next week or two.</p> <p>Though part of a routine process, the vote was seen by&#xa0;many as a referendum on how the 54-year-old Scot had responded to the numerous scandals he faced&#xa0;when he took the helm in 2018 — the firm's&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85e84e12-6dda-4c91-bde4-8198e29a6767\">entanglement</a>&#xa0;in the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eae603a4-a369-4801-a4cc-06232898a34f\">opioid crisis</a>&#xa0;being just one <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63f24181-aee0-49f4-9966-a447d79692f0?\">among many</a>.</p> <p>The voting results were unusual, even with the odds stacked against him from the beginning. His five predecessors served at least two terms, and their reappointments were often uncontested.</p> <p>The final count could reflect the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f001f3ef-e296-4eb6-b711-5f7cb773e314\">growing influence</a> of a younger generation of partners making waves within the 30,000-strong firm. “An incumbent managing partner has so many advantages [over challengers] that clearly a substantial group [of partners] felt very unhappy,” one McKinsey alum told DD.</p> <p>But Sneader's exit doesn't mean McKinsey will automatically reclaim its legendary “mystique”.</p> <p>The scent of scandal&#xa0;jeopardising its reputation with clients and recruits&#xa0;will fade with time, as&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81ff3fef-de1a-469d-ad91-c3f82a4510fd\">Lex points out</a>, but to make substantial change, the consultancy will need to overhaul a culture that has steered it wrong so many times before.</p> <h2>India: the next Spac frontier</h2> <p><strong>Robert Mancini</strong>, a former <strong>Carlyle Group</strong> dealmaker who helped run its power infrastructure business, is headed east to chase a new kind of energy source that's been electrifying Wall Street of late. We're talking about Spacs, of course.</p> <p>Mancini's <strong>RMG Acquisition Corporation II</strong>, a special purpose acquisition vehicle backed by <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, <strong>BlackRock</strong>, and de facto “Spac king” <strong>Chamath Palihapitiya</strong>, has struck a deal to take ReNew Power, one of India's largest renewable energy groups, public in New York.</p> <p>“We were approached and when we looked at it, it seemed to make a lot of sense, the process went very fast,” Sumant Sinha, the energy company's chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00451475-d5fe-41d2-b8ec-0032eb341a05\">told</a> the FT's Stephanie Findlay.</p> <p>More deals are likely to emerge just as quickly as US Spacs hunt for overseas targets — and there's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1df5dfd-36c4-49e6-bc56-506bf3ca3444\">no shortage of options</a> from India's more than 30 unicorns nearing valuations of $1bn or above. For the targets, Spacs pose a cheaper and faster route to a foreign listing.</p> <p><strong>Raj Balakrishnan</strong>, head of India investment banking at <strong>Bank of America</strong>, is busy at work on “multiple” transactions with Spacs in the $200m to $1bn range, he told Stephanie.</p> <p>Let the games begin.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <p>Two big job moves resulting from the Wirecard fallout:</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Edgar Ernst</strong>, the president of Germany's Financial Reporting Enforcement Panel, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6556766d-7360-43c8-bb7c-7fe6173b6dcd\">will step down</a> following mounting political pressure over corporate governance shortcomings exposed by the Wirecard fraud.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Jana Hecker</strong>, a senior investment banker who acted as a financial adviser to former Wirecard boss <strong>Markus Braun</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11ff2551-c46d-4aef-b8de-543c2ff5f3ee\">left her job</a> at <strong>UniCredit</strong> following revelations about the business relationship.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Houlihan Lokey </strong>has appointed <strong>Andreas Dombret</strong> as independent chairman of its activities in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. He was previously a senior adviser to the firm.</p> <p><strong>Bank of America</strong> has appointed <strong>Luca Ferrari</strong>, who currently co-heads M&amp;A for Europe, Middle East and Africa alongside <strong>Eamon Brabazon</strong>, to M&amp;A chairman across the Emea regions. He is succeeded by the bank's current head of M&amp;A for Germany, Austria and Switzerland, <strong>Birger Berendes</strong>.</p> <p><strong>BNP Paribas</strong> has hired<strong> Panos Metsis</strong> as a managing director on its telecoms, media and technology team. He joins from <strong>Akira Partners</strong>.</p> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>The sound of money </strong>Music's most infamous dealmaker Merck Mercuriadis is raising billions from investors to amass a mega collection of hits. But question marks linger as to the true value of his platinum playlists.
