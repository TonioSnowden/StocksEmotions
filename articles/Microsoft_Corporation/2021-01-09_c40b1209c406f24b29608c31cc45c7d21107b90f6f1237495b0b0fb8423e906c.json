  "text": "<p><strong>My personal style signifier</strong> is the way I&#xa0;pair things – my look is part menswear-inspired and part French-girl chic. I&#xa0;value quiet elegance. I&#xa0;don't like anything too complicated or trippy. I also love it when things fit well but&#xa0;are efficient too, like <a href=\"https://deborahpagani.com/collections/hair-objet/Hair-Pins\">Deborah Pagani's hair pins</a> – both beautiful and solid.</p> <p><strong>The last thing I bought and loved</strong> was a jasmine plant that sits in my bedroom, which I love for its soothing scent at night. I&#xa0;bought it from a nursery in Bedford, New York, called <a href=\"http://www.pgincny.com/\">Perennial Gardens</a>.</p> <p><strong>And on my wishlist</strong> is a pair of <a href=\"https://www.francotucci.com/\">Tucci</a> riding boots. Horse riding has been my passion since I was about 10. When my&#xa0;family moved to Sweden, I started looking for something to do during the summer and&#xa0;found a local stables. We couldn't really&#xa0;afford riding lessons, so I&#xa0;would groom the&#xa0;horses and muck out to&#xa0;pay for&#xa0;them. That's where it started. I&#xa0;used to&#xa0;jump but switched to dressage because I've&#xa0;become a bit of a scaredy-cat in my older days. </p> <p><strong>The best souvenir I've brought home</strong> is&#xa0;a hot-chocolate pot from <a href=\"https://www.fermesdemarie.com/en\">Les Fermes de&#xa0;Marie</a> in Megève, where we once spent the Christmas holidays skiing. The hotel is&#xa0;like something out of a fairytale, and they serve hot chocolate in beautiful white pots with long wooden handles. The&#xa0;pour is precise and functional. </p> <p><strong>My beauty and wellbeing gurus </strong>are Anthony Deliperi and Lionel Atzas at <a href=\"https://david-mallett.com/\">David Mallett</a> for my hair colour. I also love a&#xa0;strong, powerful, sculpting facial. I used to get one once a month, but now I'm all about home techniques to keep myself together. <a href=\"https://www.lanesboroughclubandspa.com/the-spa/the-brands/anastasia-achilleos/\">Anastasia Achilleos</a> taught me some massaging movements, and I also use <a href=\"https://www.joannaczech.com/products/joanna-czech-face-massage-roller\">Joanna Czech's facial massager</a> and <a href=\"https://www.georgialouise.com/shop/glolite-led-mask\">Georgia Louise's GLOLite LED mask</a>. </p> <p><strong>My style icon</strong> is Gabriela Hearst. I love how she views women, and her clothes fit&#xa0;me really well. She takes every aspect into consideration. Her dedication to sustainability is also inspiring – she's been plastic-free since 2019. When you see her garments, you can feel the integrity of them. The <a href=\"https://www.gabrielahearst.com/products/erella-pleated-shirt-dress-saffron-aw20?variant=32562547064911\">Erella</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gabrielahearst.com/products/jane-dress-blue-check-p20?variant=32412297592911\">Jane</a> shirt&#xa0;dresses from the new collection are particularly elegant. <em>Erella, $3,990; Jane, from&#xa0;$1,750</em></p> <p><strong>In my fridge you'll always find</strong> homemade almond milk, blueberries, avocados and probiotics from <a href=\"https://seed.com/\">SEED</a>, <a href=\"https://moonjuice.com/\">Moon Juice</a>&#xa0;and The Nue Co – I like to add them to&#xa0;my morning smoothie, which is a simple way to&#xa0;make sure I'm giving my body what it needs.</p> <p><strong>The last music I downloaded</strong> was [the&#xa0;EP] <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/6yhE684KUyN3PKyHVgvS4a?si=Nfisb96ETOWZLYlzdn3ZSA\"><em>Nimble Minds</em> by Central Plains</a>, which&#xa0;is my brother Nik's band. His music makes me feel his soulful personality. Seeing him live is amazing – he's such a maker of happiness. He and my dad sang at&#xa0;my wedding.</p> <p><strong>The best gift I've received recently</strong> was&#xa0;four hydrangea plants for&#xa0;Mother's Day. For&#xa0;the past few years, my husband David has planted my favourite flowers in the garden. One year it was a&#xa0;weeping cherry-blossom tree, last year he&#xa0;planted lilacs, and this year it was hydrangeas.</p> <p><strong>The beauty staple I'm never without</strong> is&#xa0;my entire make-up wardrobe from Westman Atelier. It's a system so everything is designed to work together, but if I could only use one product it would be the Vital&#xa0;Skin Foundation Stick, which soothes, calms and balances my rosacea. And for someone new to the range I'd suggest starting with the Super Loaded Tinted Highlight – it's an all-in-one product for warmth, definition and luminosity. It's fun&#xa0;to play around with make-up – I'm wearing&#xa0;more than I ever have. It can make people feel better, and I'm very happy if&#xa0;I&#xa0;can be a part of that. <a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/westman-atelier-vital-skin-foundation-stick.html\"><em>Vital Skin Foundation Stick, £62, Super Loaded Tinted&#xa0;Highlight, £69, at Cult Beauty</em></a></p> <p><strong>With time on my hands,</strong> I meditate. I like doing <a href=\"https://www.tm.org/home-page\">Transcendental Meditation</a> (TM) because it's very easy to incorporate into a busy schedule. I&#xa0;grew up with parents who were always meditating – my dad worked with the Maharishi to spread the practice of TM.</p> <p><strong>The last item of clothing I added to my wardrobe</strong> was a silk Mariano dress by <a href=\"https://www.gabrielahearst.com/\">Gabriela Hearst</a> in a butterfly print, which I&#xa0;wear with simple white trainers from <a href=\"https://www.rag-bone.com/\">Rag &amp; Bone</a>. It makes me feel&#xa0;confident and beautiful. &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>The one artist whose work I&#xa0;would collect if I could</strong> is the&#xa0;Swedish abstract painter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae8823ec-d15c-11e8-9a3c-5d5eac8f1ab4\">Hilma af Klint</a>, who produced work in the early 1900s. My daughter and I went to a mindblowing show of her work in&#xa0;New York last year. She was a&#xa0;mystic and her art&#xa0;feels so&#xa0;free and uninhibited. It was empowering to see the pictures – it&#xa0;must have felt incredible for women to see that at&#xa0;that time.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>I've recently discovered</strong> paddleboarding. I love it. When I'm in the Hamptons, I do something called Beach Bootcamp, then I do Taryn Toomey's cult body-and-mind workout <a href=\"https://theclass.com/\">The Class</a>, and then I&#xa0;go paddleboarding. </p> <p><strong>The best book I've read in the past year</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39854551-freedom-is-an-inside-job\"><em>Freedom Is an Inside Job</em> by Zainab Salbi</a>. I attended a panel with&#xa0;Salbi and was&#xa0;struck by her resilience and strength. It's a complete head-turner of&#xa0;a book. I love how open and honest she&#xa0;is about facing her own darkness within. Next on my list is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c990eb62-d56e-11e9-8d46-8def889b4137\">Ann Patchett's <em>The Dutch House</em></a>, about a pair of siblings over the course of half a century who live in the shadow of their childhood home.</p> <p><strong>I have a collection of</strong> skincare products&#xa0;that is constantly evolving. I'm&#xa0;always on the lookout for anything&#xa0;that&#xa0;can help my rosacea. I&#xa0;love&#xa0;Aurelia, particularly the <a href=\"https://www.aureliaskincare.com/skincare/revitalise-glow-serum\">Probiotic Skincare&#xa0;Revitalise &amp; Glow Serum</a>, as well&#xa0;as <a href=\"https://dalchemyskincare.uk/\">d'Alchémy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.katburki.com/\">Kat Burki</a>, as I&#xa0;tend&#xa0;to alternate products when I feel like&#xa0;my skin&#xa0;is getting tired of reacting to&#xa0;them. Probiotics help to restore and balance your skin from within – it's important for anyone suffering with redness or inflammation, like myself. &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>The blog I've been reading</strong> is Bill Gates's&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.gatesnotes.com/\">Gates Note</a>s. He sheds light on global current affairs and what could happen next, but there's always some sort of positive message. It's important to feel there might be silver linings out there – it's not all doom and gloom. </p> <p><strong>A recent “find”</strong> is my <a href=\"https://www.instantpot.co.uk/product/instant-vortex-6-4-in-1-air-fryer/\">Instant Pot Vortex 4-in-1&#xa0;Air Fryer</a>. Oh, it's so good. You can make really delicious French fries or falafel and they&#xa0;don't have to be&#xa0;deep-fried.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>If I had to limit my shopping to one neighbourhood in one city,</strong> <strong>I'd choose</strong> Ginza in Tokyo. Everything is so special and unusual – it's unlike any other shopping destination in the world. My favourite places to visit are <a href=\"https://ginza.doverstreetmarket.com/\">Dover Street Market</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ito-ya.co.jp/\">Itoya</a> – which&#xa0;has 12&#xa0;floors dedicated to writing and craft materials – <a href=\"http://www.kyukyodo.co.jp/\">Kyukyodo</a> for calligraphy supplies, and <a href=\"https://okoh.co.jp/ginza/\">Kohgen Ginza</a> for incense sticks. <em>Dover Street Market Ginza, 6-9-5 Ginza; Itoya, 2-7-15 Ginza; Kyukyodo, 5-7-4 Ginza, Kohgen Ginza, 4-14-15 Ginza; all in Chuo City, 104-0061 Tokyo</em></p> <p><strong>If I didn't live in Bedford, New York, I&#xa0;would live in</strong> County Clare on the west coast of Ireland, where my brother got married. The people are so warm and genuine – not to mention that it's one of&#xa0;the most beautiful places on Earth. My grandparents were Irish, so I've always felt a connection there. When we&#xa0;visit, I like to drink Guinness, eat soda bread with cheddar and cucumber, and watch rugby in the pub. <a href=\"https://www.adaremanor.com/\">Adare Manor</a>&#xa0;in Limerick is also beautiful. </p> <p><strong>My favourite apps</strong> are <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picturethis-plant-identifier/id1252497129\">PictureThis</a>, which I use to identify and learn about different plants and flowers, and <a href=\"https://www.vivino.com/app\">Vivino</a> for buying wine.&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Rosanna Dodds.
