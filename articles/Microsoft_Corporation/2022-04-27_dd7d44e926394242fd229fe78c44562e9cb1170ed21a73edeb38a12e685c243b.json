  "title": "How Elaine Wynn Became the Grande Dame of Las Vegas; The co-founder of Wynn Resorts won over the board—and rehabilitated the brand—after her ex-husband departed in ignominy. Now she's working to share her wealth and her hard-won wisdom.",
  "text": "<p>On this February morning, she is wearing an old Giorgio Armani blouse and newish Gabriela Hearst slacks. To her right, the shimmering copper-tone towers of the Wynn Las Vegas casino resort dominate the view from her limestone-walled dining room. She recently redid her condo with the decorator of the Obama-era White House, Michael Smith. It sits in a complex that has been home to numerous casino titans and power hitters, including the former heads of Harrah's Entertainment (now Caesars Entertainment), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Fontainebleau Resorts. It goes almost without saying that those titans have been men.</p><p>Wynn's panorama is metaphorically rich. Wynn and her ex-husband designed and operated one Las Vegas casino after another for nearly 50 years. They brought fantasy to the desert town in the form of Mirage's volcano, Treasure Island's pirate battle, Bellagio's fountains and the Wynn's luxury. While she watches over the Wynn from her aerie, her ex lives far from his high-powered former life after having been ousted in a cloud of sexual harassment allegations from the company they co-founded. These days, he can often be found in Palm Beach, Florida, with his new wife, Andrea. Las Vegas itself has changed too, its founders replaced by hired fund managers and marketing executives.</p><p>Though Elaine Wynn is no longer an executive of the empire she co-founded, she is its biggest and most active single shareholder. This makes her the last of the dreamers whose gambling parlors transformed a small town into a global resort destination while they became high-profile casino moguls with political and financial clout (Kirk Kerkorian bought MGM film studios; Steve Wynn became fundraising chair of the GOP). In one of the most testosterone-driven cities on earth, a woman outlasted and outmaneuvered them all.</p><p>Wynn, who has held a Nevada casino license since 1978, is worth an estimated $1.8 billion, according to Forbes, based largely on the value of her 8 percent share in Wynn Resorts. Yet for most of her adult life she has been known more for her philanthropic work in education, and as a supreme hostess with friends in high places (one of her former homes featured a mini Oval Office for visits from George H.W. Bush).</p><p>As she turns 80 in April, Wynn is coming to terms with the hand she was dealt when her husband divorced her, in 2010, and then left Wynn Resorts amid allegations of sexual harassment and rape (which he has repeatedly denied), revealed in a January 2018 Wall Street Journal article. Elaine Wynn became a primary catalyst in the company's reform. She established new leadership on the board and testified in support of Wynn Resorts keeping a vital license to operate a new casino in Boston.</p><p>She has remade herself as a world-level art collector and a force in public art, supporting the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and using her influence to help create a national monument designation to protect land around Michael Heizer's City—a 1.25-mile-long earthwork sculpture in Nevada. She has taken her work in Nevada education to the national level: She is chairman of Communities in Schools, which provides resources to disadvantaged children. It recently received a surprise $133 million gift from MacKenzie Scott, Jeff Bezos's ex-wife.</p><p>She laughs that her taste is evolving as she learns to create spaces that aren't mega casinos, and without pressure from her design-obsessed ex. Smith, she says, rejected some of her fabric choices as \"too hotel\" as they designed her Las Vegas home, which ended up, she says, without a single fabric that she chose herself. \"There is a Wynn style that's very much based on the hotels,\" says Smith. \"Elaine has a personal style also that we wanted to explore.\"</p><p>She is more confident in her fashion choices, and those have evolved too. Once a loyal client of Oscar de la Renta, she recently purchased a colorful oversize sweater from Christopher John Rogers and a zany embellished Libertine coat. \"Fashion is the new art,\" she says, pulling the looks from her room-size closet and describing her pursuit of an asymmetrical satin Balenciaga dress that she saw on a client at the brand's flagship store in New York. When she's in New York, she likes to shop at Linda's, a boutique curated by Bergdorf Goodman's well-known fashion director, Linda Fargo.</p><p>The Wynns have two daughters: Kevyn Wynn, a sometime fashion designer who was famously kidnapped in 1993 and released after her father paid a $1.45 million ransom, and Gilian Wynn, an entrepreneur and philanthropist. They have seven grandchildren, including 23-year-old Marlowe Early, who has begun working on an oral history of her grandmother, with whom she sided in the family split. Early says she believes that \"Mouchie\"—Elaine's family nickname—has been under-recognized for her achievements in the face of dramatic personal and professional turmoil.</p><p>\"I don't think it's fair that he gets to go on with his life,\" Early says. \"She is the person who has conducted herself with grace, value, consistency. Who is the real superhero in my eyes?\"</p><p>Elaine Wynn had worked in and served on the board of the Wynns' companies since 1967, maintaining an office and focusing her energy on everything from human resources to training to catering. She directed the Chanel-style uniforms for front desk employees when the Wynn resort opened in 2005 and persuaded Oscar de la Renta and Manolo Blahnik to open their only Las Vegas boutiques (at the time) there. But she has been credited only in recent years as a co-founder. Steve Wynn, as chairman and CEO, sometimes called himself the casinos' \"dada,\" but her management roles didn't fall into the standard executive titles.</p><p>\"I was always the wing lady,\" Wynn says. \"It wasn't part of the push for me to be concerned about gender equity or recognition. I always viewed our work as partners.\"</p><p>Michael Govan, director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, says Wynn was a key figure in the 2015 creation of Basin and Range National Monument, which protects the 704,000 acres surrounding Heizer's City. President Barack Obama approved the designation. \"When [Elaine] started making calls to Congress,\" Govan says, \"somehow I was received in a different way.\"</p><p>Wynn was one of the first major donors to support a controversial new LACMA building designed by reclusive Swiss architect Peter Zumthor. When Govan, hoping she would donate, invited Wynn to tour Zumthor's work in Europe in 2015, they wound up that August on a four-day road trip from Cologne, Germany, and Bregenz, Austria, to Haldenstein, the tiny Swiss mountain village where the architect works, with Govan behind the wheel of a rented station wagon. Marlowe Early and Govan's daughter Ariana came along, the teenagers lending a National Lampoon's Vacation vibe.</p><p>Wynn soon pledged $50 million without requesting that the building bear her name. \"Without that initial 50 there would be no project,\" says Govan. Music mogul David Geffen later pledged $150 million, securing the naming rights. Wynn is now co-chair of LACMA's board.</p><p>The Wynns once had Picasso's famous Le Rêve in their dining room (Steve Wynn later put his elbow through the painting by accident), but Elaine Wynn says her own tastes ran to the crafty, such as basketry and weaving. At a cocktail party at Donna Karan's home in New York, Wynn saw a Francis Bacon work on display that sparked her interest. \"It got me by the gurgle,\" she says.</p><p>\"I decide I'm going to enter into the auction business myself and get me a Bacon,\" she says, conceding she failed at her first attempt. She began fleshing out her collection with works by Édouard Manet and Lucian Freud, as well as contemporary artists including Lauren Halsey, Adrian Ghenie and El Anatsui.</p><p>Wynn was working with art dealer Bill Acquavella in 2013 when the Bacon triptych showed up in a Christie's auction catalog. \"I always do my 48-hour test where I leave the darn thing on a credenza somewhere and go about my business,\" Wynn says. \"Well, this thing just didn't leave me alone.\"</p><p>A basketball fanatic, Wynn was in Chicago for the Duke versus Kansas game at the State Farm Champions Classic tournament the day of the auction. She bid anonymously from her hotel room with Acquavella on the phone. \"There's a lot of action until we get up to $100 million,\" she recalls wryly. When the gavel smacked at $142.4 million, \"I had this moment, like, OK, OK,\" Wynn says. \"I get in the car to go to the game, and I am having the worst buyer's remorse. What have I just done?\"</p><p>Much has been written about Steve Wynn, Wynn Resorts and the aftermath of the 2018 sexual harassment and assault allegations. Little is known about Elaine Wynn's aftermath.</p><p>In 2018, she found herself an outsider, having been ousted from her office and the Wynn Resorts board after the divorce. She was now the largest individual shareholder, however, while the company was being investigated by Nevada and Massachusetts casino regulators. She was also locked in litigation with her ex and the company involving the control of her shares. Then she began to hear from women making the allegations about her husband. In a sign of the complexities of the relationships and notions of responsibility, Wynn says some described their experiences and apologized for not coming forward earlier.</p><p>\"I don't know how many other victims confess to the wives,\" Wynn says. \"But because of my unique situation, as being their employer-slash-mentor-slash, you know, mom—there were departments in that place that I helped put together…so I knew those people.</p><p>\"People will always say, 'How could she not have known?' \" Wynn says. \"Did I suspect that my husband could be mischievous and be, you know, a playboy?\" She pauses. \"All I did was apologize.\"</p><p>Steve Wynn, who has said that any suggestion that he assaulted a woman is \"preposterous,\" declined to comment or answer any questions for this article, according to his attorney, Reid Weingarten.</p><p>Wynn's face clouds as she discusses that year—the shame felt by her family, and the recognition that her net worth was tied up in a company that required wholly new corporate governance.</p><p>\"I was really distraught by the behavior and the history that was unveiled,\" Wynn says. When a longtime friend of Steve Wynn, John Hagenbuch, opted to remain on the board with the support of management, Elaine Wynn went rogue against the company she co-founded, waging a proxy fight to remove him that she says cost her \"several\" million dollars.</p><p>\"Everybody, even her children, told her to stop,\" Marlowe Early says.</p><p>Michael Klein, a banker and founder of the consultancy M. Klein &amp; Company, was one of the advisers who accompanied her on a road trip to make the case to investors. He notes that Wynn was often received with suspicion, more as a vindictive ex-wife than a founder and shareholder. The proxy battle was bruising.</p><p>\"To sleep at night, I'd say, I know I'm killing myself, but I can't let this story end on their terms. I am the only one that's being held accountable,\" Wynn says.</p><p>In May 2018, Wynn won the proxy battle after investors and the three largest institutional investor advisory firms voted in her favor. But with critical regulatory investigations underway in Nevada and Massachusetts, the role of Wynn Resorts chairman was held by another of Steve Wynn's longtime friends, D. Boone Wayson. Wynn saw that as a risk.</p><p>Wynn reached out to Phil Satre, the former chief executive of Harrah's casinos, who had a reputation as the casino industry's altar boy and was respected by regulators, whose support Wynn Resorts desperately needed. Satre was by then chairman of the board of Nordstrom Inc. Satre says that Wynn phoned him, then flew to Seattle, where he was attending a Nordstrom directors' meeting, and convinced him to consider joining the Wynn board.</p><p>\"The remarkable thing about Elaine is that a lot of people in her situation, in my opinion, would have taken her shareholder position and gone off and had a good time in Sun Valley and L.A. That's not what she did,\" says Satre, who resigned as chairman from Nordstrom and left other commitments to join Wynn Resorts that August. Wayson retired, and Satre became chairman in November.</p><p>\"Her ability to finalize that last play on the chessboard—I've watched some fantastic tacticians in the corporate boardroom, but no one was thinking of Phil until Elaine,\" Klein says.</p><p>Wynn says she is now pleased with the direction of the company. \"The stock's in the toilet but that's OK. I'm here for the long term. We're doing fine. And I do like the management now.\"</p><p>With the casino drama settled, Wynn has turned her focus to her children and grandchildren, her life in Las Vegas, Los Angeles and New York (her Sun Valley, Idaho, house was under contract to be sold in April) and her work in education.</p><p>She continues to trade and collect art but says she will never sell the Bacon triptych. Yet she wishes to assuage her guilt, she says, for keeping such a valuable artwork to herself, so it will be part of her estate, destined one day for an as-yet-unnamed museum. \"I'll have had the pleasure of being a steward for a while,\" Wynn says. \"And that will clear my conscience.\"</p><p>How much does Govan want it for LACMA? \"What's the scale?\" he responds. \"From one to 10? Eleven.\"</p><p>Wynn recently watched a CBS Mornings interview in which Melinda French Gates reflected candidly on exiting her 27-year marriage to Bill Gates, and on the ways women are often left to answer for the men in their lives. \"I had a lot of tears for many days. Days when I'm literally laying on the floor on the carpet,\" French Gates told interviewer Gayle King after parrying several questions about her husband's infidelities. \"Days I certainly was angry.\"</p><p>\"Man,\" Wynn says. \"There I was right in that woman's body, feeling what she was describing.\"</p><p>How Elaine Wynn Became the Grande Dame of Las Vegas</p>",
