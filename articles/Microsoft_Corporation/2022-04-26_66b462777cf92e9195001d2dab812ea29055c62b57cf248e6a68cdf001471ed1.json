  "title": "Elon Musk Adds Twitter to His Time-Juggling Challenge; The serial entrepreneur, who has lamented having too little time and being a boss, is set to take on another big project",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Musk's $44 billion deal to buy the social-media company, announced Monday, adds a new twist to a mystery in one of the most storied careers in entrepreneurial history: how he balances all of his roles.</p><p>Long before he became one of Twitter's largest investors, Mr. Musk lamented having no time, saying that no one should be chief executive forever.</p><p>\"It would be nice to have a bit more free time on my hands, as opposed to just working day and night from when I wake up 'till when I go to sleep seven days a week. It's pretty intense,\" he said last year during a Tesla analyst briefing. On top of running Tesla and SpaceX, Mr. Musk is a founder of Boring Co., a tunneling enterprise, and Neuralink Corp., a neuroscience startup working on brain-implant technologies.</p><p>A self-described \"nano-manager,\" the 50-year-old serial entrepreneur operates more like an emergency-room doctor than a traditional corporate chief, zeroing in on troubled areas and triaging, people who have worked for him said. Mr. Musk is a night owl who is chronically late for meetings and prefers them to be scheduled at noon or later. In-person briefings often stretch well into the evening; emails come in the wee hours.</p><p>Mr. Musk tries to avoid tasks often handled by top executives at other companies, like setting performance indicators or conducting wide-ranging company reviews, one former SpaceX executive said. Mr. Musk has said he prefers to focus on design and engineering over business areas such as finance or supply chain.</p><p>\"I do not like management, frankly, and I don't like being the boss of anyone,\" Mr. Musk said last summer in Delaware Chancery Court during a trial related to Tesla's purchase of home-solar company SolarCity Corp. \"But there are certain important things that need to get accomplished and that are important to the future of the world, and so then I have to sometimes be the boss.\"</p><p>Mr. Musk's longtime obsessions include colonizing Mars with SpaceX rockets and speeding the transition to more sustainable energy with Tesla's electric cars. The Twitter bid comes as Mr. Musk says he wants to defend free speech.</p><p>Shortly before Twitter said it had agreed to his offer, Mr. Musk tweeted, \"l hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means.\"</p><p>Mr. Musk didn't respond to requests for comment on how he would balance Twitter with his other business pursuits.</p><p>With Twitter, he is taking over a company that has faced criticism for having a chief executive who split his time with another business. Co-founder Jack Dorsey, who was CEO of Twitter in his second stint, from 2015 to 2021, and heads payments company Block Inc., came under fire from activist investor Elliott Management Corp. for being a part-time chief. Mr. Dorsey defended his time leading the company, and Mr. Musk spoke out in favor of Mr. Dorsey at the time.</p><p>Mr. Musk has said that owning the social-media company could occasionally prove painful.</p><p>\"If I acquire Twitter and something goes wrong, it's my fault, 100%,\" he said at a TED conference earlier this month, hours after making an unsolicited bid to take the platform private. \"I hope it's not too miserable.\"</p><p>He has indicated his priorities for Twitter include making the algorithm the company uses to promote posts open source—which would allow outsiders to view it and suggest changes—as well as being more cautious about taking down tweets or permanently banning users and introducing an \"edit button.\" He has also suggested Twitter rely less on advertising, which in the fourth quarter accounted for about 90% of the company's revenue.</p><p>Twitter declined to comment.</p><p>Tad Park, chief investment officer for Volt Equity LLC, which owns shares in both Tesla and Twitter, said he is concerned Mr. Musk may be taking on too much. \"But you can't really change who he is and these companies would not be as great as they are today without his vision,\" he said.</p><p>Late last year, Mr. Musk floated the idea of leaving his roles. As of last summer, however, Tesla had no succession plan, according to Mr. Musk. Tesla lists just two executives other than Mr. Musk on its website—Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn and Senior Vice President Drew Baglino—a far smaller cohort than that sitting atop many other large public companies. Roughly two dozen people reported directly to Mr. Musk at Tesla as of last year, according to an organizational chart viewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Tesla's at times volatile stock slid 0.7% on Monday and was off more than 9% early Tuesday, putting it down about 16% since Mr. Musk's Twitter investment became public. The Nasdaq is down roughly 11% over that period. The car company has said in securities filings that it is \"highly dependent\" on Mr. Musk's services: \"Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla.\"</p><p>At Space Exploration Technologies Corp., as SpaceX is formally known, Mr. Musk relies on Gwynne Shotwell, the company's president and among the first dozen employees hired in 2002, to handle day-to-day operations.</p><p>Employees over the years could expect to see Mr. Musk on-site certain days of the week. Before Tesla moved its headquarters to the Austin, Texas, area late last year, he often spent two days a week in person at Tesla in the San Francisco Bay Area and three in Hawthorne, Calif., a city southwest of Los Angeles that is home to both SpaceX and a Tesla design studio, former employees said.</p><p>He has regularly jetted between the two companies' facilities on a private plane. One former SpaceX executive noted that the space company's headquarters in Hawthorne, adjacent to the municipality's airport, gives Mr. Musk quick access to a runway.</p><p>Mr. Musk has said he turns to videogames to unwind. Twitter, of course, is another favorite outlet for the chief executive, who has said he taps out tweets while sitting on the toilet. Missives range from corporate updates to jabs at rivals.</p><p>Over the past weekend, as he and Twitter neared a deal, Mr. Musk tweeted about Neuralink, took aim at Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates and weighed in on another of his favorite topics: the cryptocurrency dogecoin.</p><p>Mr. Musk's hefty workload hasn't stopped him from other pursuits. Last year, he hosted the NBC late-night comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\" where, during his opening monologue, he issued a faux apology for some of the edgier swipes he has taken.</p><p>\"To anyone I've offended, I just want to say, I reinvented electric cars, and I'm sending people to Mars in a rocket ship,\" Mr. Musk said. \"Did you think I was also going to be a chill, normal dude?\"</p><p>Micah Maidenberg and Meghan Bobrowsky contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Rebecca Elliott at rebecca.elliott@wsj.com</p><p>Elon Musk Adds Twitter to His Time-Juggling Challenge</p>",
