Kevin Stitt commuted the death sentence of Julius Jones to life without parole Thursday, hours before Mr. Jones was scheduled to be executed, in a case that had drawn doubts from the state's pardon and parole board.</p><p>\"After prayerful consideration and reviewing materials presented by all sides of this case, I have determined to commute Julius Jones' sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole,\" said Mr. Stitt, a Republican.</p><p>Mr. Jones was a 19-year-old student at the University of Oklahoma when he was arrested and prosecuted in the 1999 death of Paul Howell, who was fatally shot during a carjacking. Mr. Jones, now 41, was convicted of first-degree murder in 2002 and sentenced to death. His co-defendant, Christopher Jordan, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Mr. Jordan testified against Mr. Jones at the trial. Mr. Jones, who has been incarcerated for nearly 20 years, has long maintained his innocence.</p><p>The case drew national attention with celebrities and athletes calling Mr. Jones's incarceration a miscarriage of justice. Hundreds of students protested outside Mr. Stitts's office this week, and more than 6.5 million people signed an online petition asking him to stop the execution.</p><p>-- Deanna Paul</p><p>---</p><p>ART AUCTIONS</p><p>Constitution Copy Is</p><p>Sold for $43 Million</p><p>A rare, first-edition copy of the U.S. Constitution sold for $43.2 million at Sotheby's Thursday.
