  "title": "Facebook Posts Slower Sales Growth With Apple Privacy Policy; Social-media giant to change reporting structure, breaking out unit that includes AR and VR products and services",
  "text": "<p>Facebook also said Monday that it was changing its reporting structure to break out a unit called \"Facebook Reality Labs\" that encompasses augmented-reality and virtual-reality products and services. The move will separate results for that unit from the core business segment including its flagship Facebook platform and other apps such as Instagram. The company said it expects investment in Facebook Reality Labs to reduce its overall operating profit in 2021 by around $10 billion.</p><p>Facebook said third-quarter revenue reached $29.01 billion, up 35% from the year-ago period but below the $29.56 billion that analysts polled by FactSet were expecting. The revenue increase represented a slowdown in year-over-year sales growth from the 56% jump Facebook enjoyed in the second quarter and the 48% uptick seen in the prior three-month period.</p><p>In its July earnings report, Facebook warned that Apple's privacy changes to its iOS operating system could crimp ad-targeting capabilities in the third quarter, as more people update their iPhones and iPads. Last week Snap Inc. blamed the Apple policy for an expected slowdown in revenue growth for the current quarter, leading its stock price to fall more than 20%.</p><p>Facebook's third-quarter profit rose 17% to $9.19 billion, or $3.22 a share. The company said it had 3.58 billion monthly users, up 12% from a year earlier.</p><p>Facebook shares, which retreated 5% after Snap reported the ad issues that it linked to Apple, rose 1.26% ahead of results and more than 1% in after-hours trading.</p><p>The social-media company kicks off a busy week of earnings for tech giants. Microsoft Corp. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. are scheduled to report quarterly results after the bell Tuesday, with Apple and Amazon.com Inc. numbers due out Thursday. All are expected to post healthy year-over-year top-line growth, as consumers and businesses continue to embrace the digital products and services they offer.</p><p>Global supply-chain disruptions were expected to add to the sales growth slowdown for Facebook, according to Jefferies analysts, as vendors dealing with limited inventory curtail their ad spending. Still, the investment firm said the digital advertising is robust and that a new ad product offered on Facebook's Instagram service has gone live, providing a new revenue stream.</p><p>Facebook said it expected sales this quarter of $31.5 billion to $34 billion, reflecting what it called \"continued headwinds from Apple's iOS 14 changes\" and other factors.</p><p>The parent of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp also has been contending with other challenges. They include intense regulatory scrutiny in Washington and criticism by its own oversight board following a series of Wall Street Journal investigations, called the Facebook Files, into the company's operations.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's your view on the current state of Facebook's business? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Last week the U.K.'s competition regulator fined Facebook £50.5 million, equivalent to $69.6 million, alleging it breached reporting requirements during a review of its proposed takeover of Giphy, an online provider of animated images. Facebook separately agreed to pay a financial penalty as part of settlements with the U.S. government. It had accused the social-media company of illegally reserving lucrative jobs for immigrant workers it was sponsoring for permanent residence instead of searching for and considering available U.S. workers.</p><p>Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg lately has been promoting his vision for the metaverse, loosely defined as an extensive future online world where people exist and interact in shared virtual spaces through digital avatars. He recently described the metaverse as the next generation of the internet and the next chapter for his company. Facebook said last week that it plans to create 10,000 jobs in Europe over the next five years to work on its metaverse-related endeavors.</p><p>The Facebook Files</p><p>A series offering an unparalleled look inside the social-media giant's failings—and its unwillingness or inability to address them.</p><p>* Facebook's Internal Chat Boards Show Politics Often at Center of Decision Making</p><p>Write to Sarah E.
