  "title": "Microsoft  Reviews  Policies  On Abuse  And Bias  ----  By Aaron Tilley",
  "text": "<p>   Microsoft Corp.'s board on Thursday said it would review the company's sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies and unveil a summary of the results of past investigations into how the company handled allegations against company executives, including co-founder Bill Gates. </p><p>   The review follows an unexpected win by activist shareholders at the annual meeting in November of a proposal demanding greater disclosure of sexual-harassment issues. </p><p>   \"Our culture remains our number one priority and the entire Board appreciates the critical importance of a safe and inclusive environment for all Microsoft employees,\" said Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella. </p><p>   \"We're committed not just to reviewing the report but learning from the assessment so we can continue to improve the experiences of our employees. I embrace this comprehensive review as an opportunity to continue to get better.\" </p><p>   The review will be conducted by law firm Arent Fox. </p><p>   Arent Fox will submit its findings to Microsoft senior management and board members with recommendations. The company expects to be able to share a summary of the findings in the spring. </p><p>   The law firm's review will lead to the public release of a Microsoft transparency report detailing the effectiveness of the company's workplace policies related to harassment and discrimination. It will include data on the number of sexual harassment cases investigated and what the results were. The report will also summarize the results of investigations into Mr. Gates and other leaders. </p><p>   The Wall Street Journal reported last year that Microsoft board members pursued an investigation in 2019 into the billionaire's prior romantic relationship with a female employee. He stepped down from the board in 2020. In the Journal article, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gates said the affair had ended amicably close to 20 years earlier and that his decision to leave the board wasn't related to any investigation. </p><p>   Microsoft on Thursday said it is going beyond the shareholder proposal and would compare itself with the best practices of other companies. </p><p></p>",
