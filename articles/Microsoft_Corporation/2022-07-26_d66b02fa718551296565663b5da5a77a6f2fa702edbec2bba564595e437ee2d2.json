  "text": "<p>The company, which has a dominant share in the markets for internet search, navigation and video streaming, is considered a bellwether for the strength of online advertising. Any slowdown, on the heels of weak results from social-media companies Twitter Inc. and Snap Inc. last week, would suggest further weakness in an industry critical to the health of many internet companies.</p><p>Alphabet is expected to post $69.87 billion of second-quarter revenue on Tuesday, up almost 13% from the same period last year, according to the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet. That would be the slowest rate of growth since the second quarter of 2020, when the pandemic crimped demand for advertising in some areas, including travel.</p><p>Signs of caution are already appearing. Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said this month the company would slow hiring for the rest of the year, urging employees to be \"more entrepreneurial, working with greater urgency, sharper focus, and more hunger than we've shown on sunnier days.\" A Google spokesman said last week it would pause most new hiring for two weeks so that teams can better plan staffing needs.</p><p>YouTube, Google's video-streaming business, is expected to generate $7.49 billion in advertising revenue during the second quarter, extending a slowdown in growth as it competes for viewers with services such as ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok. Analysts expected sales to climb 7.0% compared with the same period last year, after they rose more than 14% in the first quarter.</p><p>Investors will be closely watching whether Google's search business \"can continue its remarkable run\" after cracks have begun showing in YouTube and the broader online advertising sector, analysts at Bernstein wrote last week.</p><p>On Friday, Twitter said \"advertising industry headwinds associated with the macroenvironment\" contributed to a decline in revenue during the quarter as the company withdrew forward-looking guidance.</p><p>The day before Twitter's earnings, Snap reported its weakest-ever quarterly sales growth as a public company, sending shares plummeting more than 26% in after-hours trading.</p><p>MoffettNathanson analysts lowered their overall expectations for online advertising companies last week to \"factor in further macroeconomic weakness,\" including the strengthening U.S. dollar. Google and other businesses that cater to data-driven marketers will likely be the most resilient, they added.</p><p>Analysts expect sales in the Google Cloud division to rise 38% from a year ago to $6.4 billion in the second quarter. The business is expected to record an operating loss of $803 million during the quarter, reflecting Google's heavy spending push as it attempts to catch up to Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. in the cloud market.</p><p>Write to Miles Kruppa at miles.kruppa@wsj.com</p><p>Google Sales Growth Expected to Slow as Pressures Mount on Ad Market</p>",
