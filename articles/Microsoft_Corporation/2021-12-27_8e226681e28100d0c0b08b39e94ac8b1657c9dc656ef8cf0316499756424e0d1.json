  "text": "<p>The trick here? Ugly sells, especially when it's buzzy. On Gucci's website a $1,250 sweatshirt with a freakish fanged creature printed on it is nearly sold out. As are ungainly $620 heeled espadrilles covered in ostentatious Gucci print. Other brands are finding clothes that land somewhere between playfully perplexing and genuinely off-putting just as bankable. Adidas's Yeezy Foam RNNR, a sneaker that looks like a smushed, perforated turtle shell, has sold out and is now listed at more than double its $80 sticker price on resale sites like StockX. At the higher end, the boutiquey brand ERL is selling out of its $865 puffers with a Peter Max-esque shock of colors.</p><p>WEIRD CLOTHES FROM YEARS PAST</p><p>* From Nike to Balenciaga, the Seven Strangest Sneakers of 2020</p><p>* Fashion Is Weird: The 7 Strangest Clothing Items of 2019</p><p>This year, making an impact online got even more important. With Covid still looming, people spent less time shopping in stores and fashion brands largely skipped in-person runway shows in favor of digital video presentations. Like most clothing close-watchers, I spent the year looking at garments mostly through my computer screen, including the unforgettable oddities that made me gasp or giggle enough to earmark them for this very column.</p><p>In fashion, beautiful, huggable navy sweaters and luminescent white sneakers are a dime a dozen (well, maybe much more than a dime) but to create something ingeniously, unforgettably, profitably ugly? That takes skill. Here, eight curiosities get their due. See you next year.</p><p>1. Avavav 'Very Slimy Feet' Shoes</p><p>These unisex algae-colored, webbed-toed behemoths from the rising Italian label Avavav look like they wandered off the set of \"Swamp Thing.\"</p><p>2. Raf Simons Giant Pink Sweater</p><p>In March, Belgian designer Raf Simons sent a bright pink sweaterwith elephantine sleeves down the runway, but it wasn't until Washington Wizards' player Kyle Kuzma wore it before a November game that people really noticed the colossal knit. Twitter pundits compared the sweater to an inflatable man outside a car dealership, the Pink Panther and something out of Dr. Seuss. Only diehards remember if the Wizards won that night, but the sweater? Unforgettable.</p><p>3. Konstantin Chaykin Minions Watch</p><p>This year, over a decade after \"Despicable Me\" premiered, Konstantin Chaykin, a Russian watchmaker, introduced an inexplicable, googly-eyed watch dedicated to the film's gibberish-speaking sidekicks. The watch retailed for around $15,000 and was limited to 38 pieces, all of which sold out. \"Despicable,\" apparently, is in the eye of the beholder.</p><p>4. Suicoke and Midorikawa Painted Toe Shoes</p><p>Since Balenciaga showed them on the runway a couple years ago, finger-toed shoes have been a tantalizing yet off-putting trend. How to make split-digit shoes more ungainly? Add painted nails. These collaborative monstrosities withcherry \"toenails\" cost $268, but at least they'll save you a trip to the nail salonâ€¦I guess?</p><p>5. Fendi's Crop-Top Short Suits</p><p>There is nothing wrong with a man showing a bit of skin. But Fendi's belly-button-baring suit is what happens when you're so focused on showing off your abs that you lose all good sense. Too formal to be beachwear, too audacious to brave the C-suite, this ill-calibrated outfit just looks like the sewing machine ate the other half.</p><p>6. Mschf Satan Shoes</p><p>With a Lil Nas X endorsement, human blood in the sole (allegedly) and an $1,018 price, these unsanctioned customized sneakers spurred a trademark lawsuit from Nike (later withdrawn after Mschf agreed to let customers send back their shoes), and fueled a satanic panic online.</p><p>7. Microsoft XBox x Gucci Series X Special Edition Console Bundle</p><p>An XBox Series X retails for $500. Gucci's excessively elite edition of the console with monogrammed controllers and a leather carrying case sold for $10,000. Sadly, it will not make you any better at \"Call of Duty.\"</p><p>8. Tommy Cash x Adidas Elongated Superstars</p><p>For when you really, really need to trip someoneon the other side of the room.</p><p>More in Style &amp; Fashion</p><p>* Today's 'It' Bags Are Under $350.
