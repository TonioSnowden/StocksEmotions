  "text": "<p>President Biden nominated Mr. Kanter in July to lead the antitrust division, a choice welcomed by progressives who want the government to challenge more corporate mergers and business conduct that could stifle competition.</p><p>Mr. Kanter has seen two decades of antitrust battles from several vantage points. His early career was at the Federal Trade Commission, which shares antitrust authority with the Justice Department. He then spent about 20 years in private practice representing a range of corporate clients.</p><p>Over time his focus shifted from defending companies facing government investigations to representing clients who urged the government to take action against industry giants, especially top tech companies.</p><p>Both he and Lina Khan, Mr. Biden's choice to lead the FTC, have argued that the antitrust agencies need to do more to prevent companies from acquiring too much power in the marketplace.</p><p>Mr. Kanter has represented Microsoft Corp. and others in battles with Alphabet Inc.'s Google, which is facing antitrust claims from the Justice Department and state attorneys general. (News Corp, the parent company of The Wall Street Journal's owner, Dow Jones &amp; Co., also has been a client of Mr. Kanter.)</p><p>The Justice Department hasn't had a Senate-confirmed antitrust chief since Makan Delrahim left at the end of the Trump administration. Nevertheless, the antitrust division has filed a series of aggressive cases this year.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
