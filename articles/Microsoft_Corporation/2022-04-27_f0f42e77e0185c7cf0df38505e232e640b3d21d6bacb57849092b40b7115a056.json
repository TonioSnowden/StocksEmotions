  "text": "<p>On Tuesday, the Nasdaq Composite recorded its largest one-day percentage decline since September 2020, while the Dow dropped more than 800 points, as investors digested earnings reports and weighed concerns about inflation, the prospect of rapid policy tightening by the Federal Reserve, and the spread of Covid-19 in China.</p><p>\"Earnings growth in general is coming in fairly solid for the quarter, but markets are mostly focused on some of the macro concerns around aggressive tighter Fed policy, as well as this global growth scare that's playing out,\" said Emily Roland, co-chief investment strategist at John Hancock Investment Management.</p><p>Many big companies are reporting earnings this week, with results due on Wednesday from companies including Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Ford Motor. Twitter, which this week agreed to sell itself for $44 billion to Elon Musk, is set to report Thursday.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down to 2.768% on Wednesday from 2.773% on Tuesday. Recently, investors have sold bonds in anticipation of higher interest rates, and the yield on the benchmark note remains close to its highest level since 2018. Bond yields rise as prices fall.</p><p>Natural-gas prices in Europe rose by 3.1% to €106.42 a megawatt-hour, equivalent to $112.83, after earlier leaping more than 20% on Wednesday.

Twitter fell 1.7% to $48.82, about 10% below the $54.20 per-share-price that Elon Musk and Twitter agreed to in their deal to take the company private.</p><p>Microsoft jumped 5.3% premarket after it reported Tuesday higher revenue and profit last quarter as demand for its cloud services and software continued to climb.</p><p>Chipotle Mexican Grill added 3.6% premarket after the burrito chain said total revenue increased 16% last quarter amid higher food, beverage and packaging costs—which the company said was partially offset by menu-price increases.</p><p>Lucid Group gained 6.1% after the company late Tuesday said the government of Saudi Arabia had agreed to purchase up to 100,000 vehicles over a 10-year period.</p><p>In contrast, Google parent Alphabet fell 2.4% before the opening bell after the technology behemoth posted slower sales growth amid disruptions in digital advertising spending.</p><p>Robinhood Markets fell 1.2% premarket after the online brokerage said it waslaying off 9% of its full-time employees. The company is set to report earnings Thursday.</p><p>In commodities, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, added 0.3% to $104.97 a barrel.</p><p>In currency markets, the dollar extended its rise, with the ICE U.S. Dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of others, rose 0.4% to 102.70, its highest level since the coronavirus-induced market drawdown of March 2020.</p><p>Overseas, European stocks were little changed, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index edging up 0.1%. Major markets in Asia were mixed, with benchmarks in Japan and South Korea falling more than 1% and Chinese indexes gaining.</p><p>The CSI 300 index of the largest stocks listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen rose 2.9%, recouping some of its recent losses. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was up 0.1%.</p><p>The rebound came after China on Tuesday reported its lowest tally of Covid-19 cases in three weeks, and President Xi Jinping highlighted the importance of infrastructure for economic growth, singling out transport, energy and water conservation. Machinery and building-materials stocks jumped.</p><p>Write to Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stock Futures Rise After Tech-Led Selloff</p>",
