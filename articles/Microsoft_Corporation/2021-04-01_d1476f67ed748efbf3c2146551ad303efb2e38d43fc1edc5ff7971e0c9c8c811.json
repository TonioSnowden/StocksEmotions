  "text": "<p><em>A quick note before we start, City Bulletin will be taking a holiday break from today and will be back on Tuesday.</em> </p> <p>Next expects its full-year profits to be better than expected, but held back from resuming shareholder cash returns until the outlook is clearer.</p> <p>The retailer targeted profit of around £700m in the current financial year, approximately matching its year-to-January 2020 total and about £30m higher than its previous estimate. Revenue will remain flat year on year, with profitability helped by better than expected online sales and the extension of the UK government's business rates holiday for an additional three months. </p> <p>Online sales jumped more than 60 per cent in the first eight weeks of this financial year compared with two years ago. But no dividend or share buybacks were proposed in spite of Next's year-end net financial debt falling by £502m to £610m.</p> <p>“Our best guess is that the consumer economy, at least in the short term, will be healthier than many presume,” said Lord Simon Wolfson, Next chief executive.&#xa0;“It seems likely that a combination of pent-up demand along with a healthy overall increase in personal savings will serve to keep the consumer economy moving forward.&#xa0;</p> <p>“We have (perhaps optimistically) assumed that the rollout of Covid vaccines will result in stores remaining open for the year, once the current lockdown has passed. If this assumption is not correct, it is unlikely we will meet our central guidance for sales and profit.”</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p>Wealth manager <strong>Quilter</strong> has agreed to sell its international business to life assurance company Utmost Group for £483m. The disposal “allows us to focus on accelerating our growth and efficiency plans as well as further simplifying and focusing our business around its core UK high net worth and affluent customer proposition,” said Paul Feeney, Quilter CEO.</p> <p><strong>Liberty Steel</strong> owner Sanjeev Gupta said his business owed “many billions” of pounds to Greensill Capital, the collapsed finance group, and that the UK business would benefit from more working capital. But speaking to BBC radio, Gupta insisted there was no risk of plant closures as global operations remain profitable. </p> <p><strong>Equiniti</strong>, the financial services outsourcer, posted a £6.6m pre-tax loss for 2020 as revenue fell 15.1 per cent to £471.8m. Cheryl Millington, chief executive, said: “While uncertainty continues, the outlook for capital market activity in 2021 is encouraging and we have started the year well with a number of important new business wins.”</p> <p>Betting software maker <strong>Sportech </strong>said it hoped to deliver “significant” capital returns to shareholders in 2021 after reporting Covid-19 blighted annual results. The company posted a £5.2m adjusted pre-tax loss from continuing operations for 2020, widening from a £2m loss the year before.</p> <p><strong>Hipgnosis</strong>, the music royalties fund, said HMRC has approved its request to be classed as an investment trust company. The change will allow Hipgnosis to transfer its residency from Guernsey&#xa0;to the UK but still avoid taxation on its chargeable gains. </p> <p>Stamp collector <strong>Stanley Gibbons</strong> said trading in the second half of its fiscal year ended March has continued the trends reported in the first half, with digital sales helping offset the effects of the third UK lockdown. “Although the philatelic side remains challenging there have been more 'less bad' months recently,” the company said. The publishing side of its business “has benefited from what we believe are significant market share gains as well as hobbies as a whole benefiting to some degree through the restrictions imposed on everyday life.”</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Global</strong> <strong>dealmaking</strong> activity had its strongest start to the year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bacdf86f-e786-4439-966e-f5958adb1c59\">in four decades</a>, fuelled by a flurry of US acquisitions and Spac mergers, even as the global economy reels from the impact of lockdowns and coronavirus restrictions. Deals worth $1.3tn were agreed in the three months to March 30, more than any first quarter since at least 1980 and topping even the heady levels of the dotcom boom at the turn of the millennium, according to figures from Refinitiv.</p> <p>Some of the banks that collectively had more than $50bn of exposure to <strong>Archegos Capital</strong> are conducting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9137b765-5536-40dc-8823-1da2813aa533\">internal inquiries</a> over whether Bill Hwang, the former hedge fund manager who ran the family office, concealed his other positions from them. Mizuho&#xa0;on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7332bcd-366e-4c19-9f3a-e728555bcbcb\">became the latest bank</a> to say it has suffered losses linked to its relationship with Archegos. </p> <p><strong>Microsoft</strong> has won a contract worth as much as $21.9bn to provide the US army with at least 120,000 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cbfad4be-65f7-4810-b2d3-deadcd3d803a\">augmented reality headsets</a>, in a significant move to bring the next generation of computing to the battlefield.&#xa0;Microsoft has been working with the army for two years on a prototype of the product that builds on its existing smartglasses product for businesses called HoloLens.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Lex</strong> <br>The Deliveroo IPO has become not only the largest London float for almost a decade but also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5725a4cf-4bff-4b4a-bb04-957a77d2ee92\">the most embarrassing</a>.&#xa0;Some fund managers see this as a financial victory, as well as a moral one. It's a pity their message on standards was not delivered with greater subtlety.</p> <p><strong>Bryce Elder <br></strong>The FCA has opened a new consultation on Spacs, or search funds as they were once known, amid a gold rush on Wall Street.&#xa0;Matching these numbers in London would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d5adbfe-6045-4ec0-a6b7-608764918b31\">need a fundamental change of approach</a> that won't be delivered by token measures such as minimum market cap criteria.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
