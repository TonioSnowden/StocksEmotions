  "title": "C-Suite Strategies (A Special Report) --- Employee Resource Groups Are on the Rise at U.S. Firms: Also known as affinity groups, these organizations are gaining prominence as companies view them as strategic allies",
  "text": "<p>\"The shift reflects greater interest in inclusive corporate cultures among workers, investors and consumers,\" says Kevin Martin, chief research officer of the Institute for Corporate Productivity, a human-capital research and advisory firm. \"ERGs play a tremendous role in influencing and providing important insights about a company's brand and reputation.\"</p><p>About 35% of companies have added or expanded their support for ERGs since the start of 2020, according to a 2021 study by McKinsey &amp; Co. and LeanIn.org of 423 organizations employing 12 million people.</p><p>That support takes many forms. For instance, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., LinkedIn and Justworks Inc. recently started offering financial rewards to their ERG leaders. Meanwhile, companies such as Whirlpool Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc. have given their ERGs a substantial voice during the pandemic and racial-justice movement.</p><p>ERGs -- also called affinity groups -- sprang up in the 1970s almost exclusively to recruit and retain Black staffers.</p><p>Roughly 90% of major U.S. employers currently have ERGs, says Mr. Martin, based on the productivity institute's research. He says the research also shows that the proportion of those employers with at least 10 groups has risen from a decade ago.</p><p>Successful ERGs enjoy strong ties with upper management, have well-funded structures, incubate product ideas and champion high-profile issues like domestic-partner benefits, according to experts.</p><p>The rising influence of ERGs can be seen at medical-device maker Medtronic PLC. During the pandemic, the ERG serving women has focused on easing burdens for members suddenly facing huge child-care demands while working from home. Medtronic women's network now has 20,297 members.</p><p>Through member surveys and chats with Medtronic management, network leaders intensified their pursuit of a formal flexible-work initiative they had presented to top executives in early 2020. At the time, informal flextime guidelines varied by location, according to a company spokeswoman. The company soon sanctioned shortened schedules, compressed workweeks and flexible start and stop times.</p><p>ERGs have also made their presence increasingly felt in the area of social justice. At Salesforce.com, George Floyd's murder prompted the business-software giant to form a racial-equality and justice task force led by Ebony Beckwith, chief philanthropy officer and the highest-ranked Black executive at the company. Salesforce also appointed the global president of BOLDforce, its ERG for Black staffers, to the task force. Representatives from the company's 12 ERGs joined four advisory panels that devised the task force's goals and strategies.</p><p>One such participant was Aubree Broadwater, the unpaid leader of BOLDforce's Atlanta chapter. For her regular job, she trains Salesforce colleagues about more inclusive hiring.</p><p>Ms. Broadwater's panel focused on people issues. It gathered ideas by holding virtual roadshows with three ERGs and analyzing results from employee surveys that BOLDforce leaders had helped craft.</p><p>As Salesforce empowers and supports ERGs, the company must also make sure \"the responsibility doesn't fall on them alone to create change,\" says Chief People Officer Brent Hyder. That will happen as \"we continue to create dedicated roles for [equality] work, hiring leaders to scale and operationalize our equality strategy across our workplace and communities,\" Mr. Hyder adds.</p><p>The task force embraced ambitious multiyear goals that include doubling the representation of U.S. Black employees in leadership roles and committing $100 million to purchases from Black-owned businesses. Another focus of the task force: expand voter registration within American communities of color. As part of that effort in 2020, Ms. Broadwater persuaded heads of Black ERGs at Atlanta tech companies to become involved in her local drive.</p><p>Employee resource groups at certain companies have also helped find innovative ways to diversify the workforce.</p><p>Consider Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America. Based on recommendations from its ERGs, the retirement-services and investment firm changed applicant-screening practices last year.</p><p>Interview panels must now include at least one woman and/or underrepresented minority colleague. And at least 80% of candidate slates must be diverse.</p><p>\"Since adopting these recruitment changes,\" says Chief People Officer Sean N. Woodroffe, \"we have seen a meaningful increase in promotions or lateral moves among employees who belong to our [ERGs].\"</p><p>ERGs will gain greater clout as more businesses reward and formally train their leaders, advocates say.</p><p>Nowadays, few employers go as far as Bristol-Myers, where about 41% of employees world-wide belong to at least one group.. After renaming ERGs people and business-resource groups, it picked a full-time paid leader from within the drug company for each of its eight groups by 2019. Leaders must prepare three-year strategies and financial plans.</p><p>By treating these groups as business units, \"we believe we can have strong business outcomes,\" says Linda Leonard, the company's senior director of global diversity and inclusion. Viewing ERGs solely as social networks, she adds, \"is a shame.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Lublin, former career columnist at The Wall Street Journal, is the author of \"Power Moms: How Executive Mothers Navigate Work and Life.\" She can be reached at joann.lublin@wsj.com.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
