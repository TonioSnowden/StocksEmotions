  "title": "Letter: EU lawmakers must resist Big Tech's blandishments",
  "text": "<p>Big Tech firms are deploying immense resources to influence, persuade and cajole EU institutions to roll back obligations under the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which is now undergoing the finishing touches of Brussels policymakers (“Google's plan to cut cookies threatens new EU skirmish”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eccf5514-8b83-4d85-8305-f882adf5dac3\">Report</a>, January 24); and “Google makes last-minute attempt to influence EU legal curbs”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c7527bc-7ab4-41cd-ba94-3145208da9c3\">Report</a>, January 12). </p> <p>But for the sake of Europe's consumers, EU lawmakers must resist attempts by Big Tech companies to derail or neutralise these rules before they reach the statute book. Ironically, Big Tech firms and the trade associations, think tanks and “favourable” academics they deploy to mirror, endorse and amplify their arguments, claim to be acting to defend the interests of consumers and small businesses. </p> <p>They are clearly not.</p> <p>The reality is that for too long Big Tech companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple have misused their powerful positions to game the internet in favour of their narrow vested interests, for example by excluding competitors rather than serving the broad interests of consumers and other users.</p> <p>Big Tech companies particularly object to the fact that the DMA would outlaw their ability to limit consumer choice by giving preference or more visibility to their own services compared with those of rivals. They really do not want to be deprived of their ability to “lock in” customers by making it difficult to switch away from default apps and services. </p> <p>They do not like being restricted on how they can collect and use consumer data. And they strongly dislike that the DMA would make it easier for new companies with innovative products to enter digital markets.</p> <p>It is therefore imperative that during these last critical weeks of the negotiations, MEPs and member states are not blinded by Big Tech's latest avalanche of glossy advertising, emails and targeted social media posts but put Europe's consumers and society first.</p> <p><strong>Ursula Pachl</strong> <br><em>Deputy Director General<br>European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) <br>Brussels, Belgium</em></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: EU lawmakers must resist Big Tech's blandishments' FT.com 28 January.
