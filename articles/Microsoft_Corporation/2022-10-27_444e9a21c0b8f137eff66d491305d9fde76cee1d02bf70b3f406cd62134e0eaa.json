  "title": "Amazon's Holiday Blues Come Early—and Hard; Downbeat forecast sinks shares as both retail and cloud businesses feel pinch of slowing economy",
  "text": "<p>More notably, Amazon projected revenue and operating income for the fourth quarter that was well below the consensus forecast, leading its shares to fall as much as 18% in after-hours trading. If that level of decline holds Friday, it would be the stock's worst single-day drop in more than 16 years, according to FactSet.</p><p>That may seem excessive, considering that Amazon already shed a third of its market value this year. About 8 percentage points of that loss came over the last two days, as big tech peers Microsoft and the parent companies of Google and Facebook posted their own disappointing results.</p><p>But Amazon's massive retail business, which now generates more than $350 billion in annual sales, is particularly exposed to consumers across the globe who are seeing their spending power crimped by rising inflation. And its typically strong cloud business isn't immune either; Amazon Web Services segment revenue grew by a record-low 27% from a year earlier to about $20.5 billion in the quarter, as Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky noted that the company saw a lot of its corporate customers \"trying to cut back on their bills.\" Archrival Microsoft also projected disappointing growth for its own cloud business, but AWS plays a more vital role in helping to offset Amazon's thin margins on the retail side. AWS operating income rose only 11% year-over-year, well short of the 31% growth Wall Street had expected.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's your outlook on Amazon? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Analysts also had been expecting Amazon sales to rebound in the second half of this year. But the company's forecast makes clear that won't be happening. The midpoint of Amazon's fourth-quarter revenue forecast would represent growth of 5% year-over-year—record-low growth for a quarter that has historically accounted for nearly a third of the company's annual revenue. Operating income is also projected to slide 42% year-over-year at the midpoint, as Amazon is still working to fully utilize an overbuild of fulfillment capacity put in place during the pandemic. The Everything Store has an awful lot on its plate.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Amazon's Holiday Blues Come Early—and Hard</p>",
