  "text": "<p>   \"Incredible value is there to be made, but too often in the past, as a sector, we have left too much of that value on the table,\" Andrew Penn, CEO of Australian network operator Telstra Corp., said during a recent appearance at an industry event. \"The telecommunications sector has provided the platform for growth but others have realized the majority of it, and we can't let that happen again.\" </p><p>   Some telecom and technology executives have privately expressed doubts that domestic phone and broadband companies would be in as strong a position as big tech to profit from clients looking to run complex 5G applications in the cloud. If big cloud-services providers are the companies billing clients for 5G software, data storage and private networks that take the place of Wi-Fi or wired connections, telecom companies could be reduced to a secondary role that earns them less profit. </p><p>   Despite the apathy and delays, high costs and low return so far, many telecom companies remain optimistic. Verizon said during a recent investor update that the new high-speed wireless technology would dramatically boost its growth over the coming years. The company cited opportunities in selling cellphone users pricier plans, new business from wireless home broadband service and long-term opportunity from selling new services for businesses -- which promise to make things like manufacturing much more efficient. </p><p>   Verizon plans to offer those mobile edge compute services in two ways. A private-network model lets the cellphone carrier control its relationship with the client. But Verizon has also struck agreements to build public varieties of mobile edge compute systems that draw on resources from Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud Platform. Clients may choose either option. </p><p>   Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg says it makes \"no difference when it comes to our potential to make revenue and profit\" whether a business customer interacts with Verizon or a big cloud-computing company to run a private 5G network. </p><p>   At Ford Motor Co.'s Dearborn, Mich., production line for electric trucks, AT&amp;T and Azure have partnered to provide 5G services. AT&amp;T business chief Anne Chow says both providers generate revenue by running parts of the auto maker's factory-area 5G network, which helps workers send software updates to vehicles over the air, scan components for imperfections and keep phones and tablets connected to the internet. </p><p>   \"It's very much a relationship of equals in support of a shared client,\" she says. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. FitzGerald is a Wall Street Journal reporter based in Washington, D.C.
