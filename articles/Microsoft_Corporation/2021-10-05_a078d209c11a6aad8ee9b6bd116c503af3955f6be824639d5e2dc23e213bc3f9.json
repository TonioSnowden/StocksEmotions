  "text": "<p>Banks and settlement houses are making fresh efforts to digitise their inefficient paper-based practices as rising costs, regulation and encroaching new technologies put pressure on creaky systems.</p> <p>Deutsche Börse, the German exchanges operator, will unveil on Wednesday a digitised central registry that could cover 80 per cent of the country's securities from next year. The system, based on blockchain technology, could also be used for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins in future, the exchange added.</p> <p>Earlier in the week the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (Isda) digitised the vast booklet of legal documents used for most of the world's derivatives trades — in part to prepare for the arrival of contracts written on computer code.</p> <p>Those moves to modernise back-office and legal systems come after the financial system was put under extreme strain by volatility stemming from the coronavirus crisis in March last year. </p> <p>Many banks and asset managers were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30f72eef-235e-4714-9f00-c36deb30a729\">unsure</a> whether their deals had completed. The issue was exacerbated by people working from home. </p> <p>At the same time, banks have continued to show interest in the promise of blockchain technology, in which networks of computers verify transactions and create a single immutable record of trades.</p> <p>“Covid has no doubt played a role in demonstrating the need for fundamental change. Yet even in the face of this massive global wake-up call, many of the institutions that underpin the financial system have been slow to take action. That is unsustainable,” said Charley Cooper, managing director of R3, a blockchain software company which is helping Deutsche Börse.</p> <p>The German group said its project was partly prompted by incoming European regulations that demanded all newly issued securities in the bloc from 2023 will have to be in a dematerialised format. All traded securities will need to be held electronically by 2025.</p> <p>Stephan Leithner, member of the Deutsche Börse executive board, added that its new system went much further as it would create a “golden source” for all deals, which could be used by issuers, regulators and custodians as the basis for trading and administration services.</p> <p>Issuers could offer structured products to investors on the same day instead of waiting several days, which created a gap in pricing, Leithner said. A new system could automate coupon payments. “The underlying product wasn't digitised. The golden source today is the document in our safe.”</p> <p>The system will initially cover structured products such as warrants, certificates and commercial paper, which are popular products among German investors. </p> <p>Microsoft, Digital Asset Holdings and VMware are helping to build the distributed ledger. BNP Paribas, DekaBank, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Raiffeisen Bank International are among the banks that are backing the project.</p> <p>For Isda, the overhaul was its first since 2006. Since then its 130-page definitional booklet has accrued 586 pages of amendments via nearly 90 supplements, which was “no longer sustainable”, it said.</p> <p>It will publish revised digital versions in future, eliminating the need for further PDF or paper supplements, it added. Scott O'Malia, chief executive of Isda, said the group was working to support the digitisation of its products and legal documents. </p> <p>The move would potentially open up the derivatives market to greater use of&#xa0;smart contracts, computer programmes that can contain financial assets and be coded to execute actions such as interest payments automatically.</p> <p>“Financial institutions are looking to increase the efficiency of their operational processes in order to reduce complexity and cut costs,” he said.</p><p>Source: Philip Stafford 2021 'Deutsche Börse to digitise paper-based systems ' FT.com 5 October.
