  "title": "New York Times Staffers Go on One-Day Strike Amid Stalled Contract Talks; Work stoppage means editors with reporting backgrounds are set to cover the news on Thursday, people familiar with the company said",
  "text": "<p>Scores of union members picketed outside the entrance to the Times building in Midtown Manhattan Thursday afternoon.</p><p>\"Like all my colleagues, I've watched the value of my salary go down as inflation goes up,\" Andy Newman, a Times metro reporter for over 25 years, said at the rally. \"I really really love working here, and all I want is to get this settled and get a fair contract.\"</p><p>The contract negotiations have centered around pay, retirement and other benefits. The two sides haven't yet come to terms on wages, including the size of raises for the next four years, according to the union and Times management.</p><p>Many members of the Times newsroom also took to social media to urge people not to use the Times's platforms Thursday, including not playing Wordle, its popular word game.</p><p>In anticipation of the strike, the Times had identified editors with reporting backgrounds who could cover Thursday's news, according to people familiar with the company.</p><p>Some stories on the Times's website and app on Thursday simply carried a \"by The New York Times\" byline, while others were authored by newsroom editors.</p><p>However, many of the day's biggest news stories—including the prisoner swap involving basketball star Brittney Griner and the Federal Trade Commission's decision to sue Microsoft Corp. to block its planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc.—were written by traditional beat reporters.</p><p>\"We will produce a robust report on Thursday,\" Executive Editor Joseph Kahn wrote in a memo to staff on Wednesday evening. \"But it will be harder than usual.\"</p><p>More than 1,100 union members have pledged not to work Thursday and forgo pay, a NewsGuild representative said. Taking into account employees who aren't part of the union, the Times has more than 1,800 newsroom staffers around the world.</p><p>Many strikers outside of the New York Times building on Thursday held noisemakers and homemade signs and chanted phrases like, \"Give us raises, not a lunchbox.\"</p><p>\"Nobody ever wants to be out here having this kind of fight with a company whose mission we believe in deeply,\" Stacy Cowley, a Times business reporter and member of the bargaining committee, said at the rally.</p><p>In a company memo Wednesday night, Chief Executive Meredith Kopit Levien said the Times had created hundreds of new journalism jobs in recent years. \"At the same time, our ability to carry out our mission is inextricably linked to our financial success as a company,\" she wrote.</p><p>The union and management have been in contract talks for 20 months. Both sides were still negotiating on Wednesday afternoon ahead of a union-imposed deadline but didn't come to an agreement. The Times union had said last week it would go on strike Thursday if a contract deal hadn't been reached by then.</p><p>During the bargaining process, the Times rejected a proposed wage floor of $65,000 for all Guild members, instead offering $62,500 in 2024, according to people familiar with the matter. The company recently offered a choice between keeping a pension plan or selecting a new 401(k) plan, a change from its initial proposal of replacing the pension with the 401(k). </p><p>Talks had centered around pay—including the size of raises for the next four years—and retirement and other benefits.

The company, like other media outlets, is also facing a challenging economic climate as advertisers pare back spending. Activist investor ValueAct Capital Partners LP recently took a significant stake in the Times, with the intention to push the media company to more aggressively market subscriber-only content.</p><p>Other news organizations with unions represented by the NewsGuild have experienced labor tensions this year.</p><p>Last month, more than 200 staffers at Gannett Co.—the publisher of newspapers including USA Today—staged a one-day strike to push for better wages and benefits and protest layoffs and furloughs. The company in recent weeks began laying off more than 200 people, on top of another 400 job cuts earlier this year.</p><p>Journalists at Thomson Reuters, who are unionized with the NewsGuild, also went on a one-day strike in August as the union negotiated for higher wages, according to a NewsGuild of New York spokeswoman. Negotiations are still ongoing, she said.</p><p>Write to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com</p><p>New York Times Staffers Go on One-Day Strike Amid Stalled Contract Talks</p>",
