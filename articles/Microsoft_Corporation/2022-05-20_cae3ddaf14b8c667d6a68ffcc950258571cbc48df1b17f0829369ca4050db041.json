  "text": "<p>Mr. Diller, chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp. and an MGM Resorts board member, can apply for a full license after those two years, and he can also return sooner if the probe is settled with no charges, according to the commission. Mr. Diller can continue to serve as a board member under the limited license.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported in March that federal prosecutors and securities regulators were investigating large bets that Mr. Diller made -- along with his stepson Alexander von Furstenberg and David Geffen -- on Activision Blizzard shares, days before the videogame maker agreed to be acquired by Microsoft Corp. on Jan. 18.</p><p>Mr. Diller has said he had no prior knowledge of the acquisition and the purchase was a coincidence. \"I recognize that such a neat coincidence, people are going to look at it,\" Mr. Diller told the commission Thursday. \"I thought immediately that they would . . . I said, 'let's be certain we keep all the records so that whenever this is investigated, which it surely will be, that facts can be known, which is, we had no knowledge.'\"</p><p>Commissioner Steven Cohen said the commission doesn't have any concerns about Mr. Diller's character, but the investigation created an \"imperfect\" record for him as an applicant for a license.</p><p>\"We respect you sir,\" Mr. Cohen said.</p><p>Mr. Diller and IAC/InterActiveCorp. announced in 2020 that the company had spent more than $1 billion for a 12% stake in MGM Resorts, as MGM and other casino companies pursue the growth in online gambling in the U.S.</p><p>In a May 9 letter to shareholders, IAC Chief Executive Joey Levin said the company's stake in MGM Resorts stood at 15%. Mr. Levin and Mr. Diller are MGM Resorts directors.</p><p>\"We are pleased that, as anticipated, our license application was approved in Nevada,\" an IAC spokeswoman said by email. \"The limitations are procedural in nature and we expect no issues with respect to Mr. Diller's long-term licensure in the state.\"</p><p>Mr. von Furstenberg and Mr. Geffen haven't responded to requests for comment.</p><p>The Gaming Commission had delayed Mr. Diller's licensing in March after federal authorities launched insider-trading investigations into his share purchases of Activision.</p><p>Regulators said the commission didn't have access to information from federal authorities.</p><p>IAC/InterActiveCorp. shares rose 2.5% Thursday to $81.32. Shares of MGM Resorts International rose 2% to $33.65.</p><p>Nevada gambling regulators investigate the backgrounds of executives and major shareholders of casino companies and determine a person's suitability to be licensed. The state's regulations are intended to prevent corruption or criminal activity.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
