  "title": "Veterans Affairs Taps Former Microsoft Executive to Modernize Tech; The agency is in the middle of a 10-year, $16.1 billion effort to replace aging health records infrastructure",
  "text": "<p>Critics say the tech modernization effort hasn't gone as planned.</p><p>At a February meeting of two House Veterans Affairs subcommittees, Chris Pappas (D., N.H.) faulted the agency for a history of projects running behind schedule, antiquated technology and a troubled procurement process. He also pointed to a siloed structure as an impediment to meeting IT modernization goals.</p><p>IT modernization at Veterans Affairs misses the mark because of its tendency to operate in a \"stovepipe fashion, with one part of the department not working close enough with another,\" said Mr. Pappas.</p><p>The accusations weren't entirely new. Modernizing government IT has been an issue for decades. Some agencies continue to run systems on Cobol, a code developed in the 1950s. Budget shortfalls and a lack of skilled workers are often cited as key barriers to modernization efforts.</p><p>The Biden administration last year named tech modernization as a strategic priority. Mr. Biden cited veterans' care in his State of the Union address on Tuesday.</p><p>Mr. DelBene, who joined the VA in January as assistant secretary for information and technology and CIO, said he plans to implement greater discipline through a metrics-based approach.</p><p>\"VA's modernization projects, for them to be successful, they must start with a clear vision, articulatedâ€”or adequate resources, a development plan, success metrics, and strong collaborative partnerships with all stakeholders,\" he told the House subcommittees last month.</p><p>Shane Tews, a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a public-policy think tank, said new CIOs in the federal government can struggle navigating a patchwork of technology systems that aren't easily interoperable. But Mr. DelBene's experience running large, enterprise-grade IT systems at Microsoft is an asset, she said.</p><p>Mr. DelBene also previously worked for the government. After leaving Microsoft in 2013, the Obama administration recruited him to help salvage the troubled launch of Healthcare.gov, the enrollment website for the Affordable Care Act. He returned to Microsoft in 2015, most recently serving as executive vice president in charge of the company's Covid-19 response efforts.</p><p>Mr. DelBene cites one takeaway from his experiences: Improving IT management is an incremental process.</p><p>\"This isn't about changing the ship and ship's direction, it's about getting these disciplines in place and then turning the crank over and over again,\" he said in an interview.</p><p>Mr. DelBene said he believes this type of approach will help improve delivery on the VA's health-records modernization initiative, in which the agency is rolling out Cerner Corp. electronic health records software to replace the legacy system.</p><p>The transition hasn't gone smoothly. An October 2020 deployment at the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center in Spokane, Wash., resulted in errors in patients' allergy, medication and immunization data, according to a Government Accountability Office report released last month.</p><p>In addition, a survey of 833 employees at Mann-Grandstaff conducted by the VA last year found that 83.3% of employees said their morale has worsened as a result of the Cerner software implementation, and 61.7% said they disagreed or strongly disagreed with a statement that suggested they felt \"very confident\" using the Cerner system as it relates to their job tasks.</p><p>\"I think we can do a better job in our future rollouts in terms of preparedness in terms of having very clear checklists of what constitutes ready to roll,\" Mr. DelBene said.</p><p>Write to Suman Bhattacharyya at Suman.Bhattacharyya@wsj.com</p><p>Veterans Affairs Taps Former Microsoft Executive to Modernize Tech</p>",
