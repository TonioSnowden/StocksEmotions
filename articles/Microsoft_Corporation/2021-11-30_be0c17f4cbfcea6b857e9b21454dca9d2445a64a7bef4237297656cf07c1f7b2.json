Renewed travel bans and coronavirus restrictions could threaten the global recovery. In some of the tougher moves so far, Israel has banned foreigners from entry and Japan has said it would close its borders to foreign visitors until more information about the variant is available.</p><p>President Biden said Monday that Omicron was \"not a cause for panic.\" The administration is working with drug companies to develop contingency plans for vaccines or boosters in case they are needed, he said.</p><p>\"There's less likelihood we see sustained downside from something like a variant because our ability to adapt to it is higher than it was,\" said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. \"The ability to tailor vaccines makes a huge difference.\"</p><p>Moderna shares shot up $38.88, or 12%, to $368.51, adding to their gains after the stock surged more than 20% on Friday.

Apple and Microsoft rose more than 2%.</p><p>Twitter fell $1.29, or 2.7%, to $45.78 after the social-media company said Jack Dorsey was stepping down as chief executive, effective immediately, and being succeeded by Parag Agrawal, who was previously Twitter's chief technology officer.</p><p>Bitcoin rebounded after the largest cryptocurrency was pummeled by Friday's selloff. The dollar value of bitcoin rose 3.5% from its 5 p.m. ET level Sunday to $58,266.08.
