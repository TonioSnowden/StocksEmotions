  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  A Guide to Pro-Level Pizza at Home -- Pizza Guide / Cooking:  So Much Better Than Takeout  ---  To no one's surprise, consumption of that supreme comfort food, pizza, has spiked over the last couple of  years. And home cooks are taking as much pleasure in crafting their pies as they are in eating them.  ----  By Matthew Kronsberg",
  "text": "<p>\n  It was as good a reason as any to make pizza: \"During the pandemic, I needed to have some sort of passion,\" said Frederic della Faille, a product designer in New York City. </p><p>\n  He found the intervals between hydrating his dough and adding salt, the kneading and the observations of the dough's fermentation over a few days in his refrigerator \"a great meditative process.\" It added structure to weeks that could otherwise seem formless. The process was, for him, as important as the product. \"I didn't even eat a tenth of the dough I made.\" </p><p>\n  Plenty got eaten, of course. Mr. della Faille set up a portable pizza oven made by Ooni on the patio of his SoHo apartment. When he has friends over to sit outside, feast on pizza and drink wine among his tomato and basil plants, he said, \"It kind of feels like we're in Italy.\" </p><p>\n  Like Mr. della Faille, Jordan Commissiong, a financial adviser in Bermuda, got an Ooni during the pandemic. \"Basically the entire island tried its hand at sourdough,\" he said. \"So I got into it, and my breads were OK, but I really started using it for pizza dough.\" </p><p>\n  Homemade pizza is, as they say, having a moment. Aspiring pizzaiolos and pizzaiolas finally have both the tools and the time to make restaurant-grade pies in their own kitchens and backyards. </p><p>\n  The cookbook \"The Joy of Pizza,\" out next month, is an ideal starting point. Written by Dan Richer, owner of Razza Pizza Artigianale in Jersey City, N.J., with food writer Katie Parla, it offers recipes ranging from traditional Margherita pizza to pies with more esoteric ingredients, such as the filberts that anchor the Project Hazelnut pizza. A rubric for evaluating the quality of a pie covers 11 aspects of the dough's fermentation and runs to 56 items in total. There are also rubrics for judging olive oil, canned tomatoes and mozzarella. </p><p>\n  Obsessive as that sounds, consider \"Modernist Pizza,\" the latest several-volume-set from former Microsoft CTO Nathan Myhrvold and chef Francisco Migoya: Over the nearly four years it took to research the 1708-page tome, its authors spent over 200,000 hours making more than 12,000 pizzas, creating 1016 recipes in the process. More than a cookbook, \"Modernist Pizza\" examines the food from historical and scientific perspectives and can even serve as a travel guide. Its authors collectively traveled more than 100,000 miles and visited at least 250 pizzerias, which led Mr. Migoya to a controversial realization: \"There is such thing as too much pizza.\" </p><p>\n  And yet, in a harrowing year and a half for the restaurant industry, the number of independent pizzerias has actually grown, according to PMQ Pizza Magazine's 2021 Pizza Power Report. But the leap from eating to making can be daunting. \"The world of pizza was -- still is -- full of myths and mysticism and just general bullshit,\" said Mr. Myhrvold. \"You know, 'You can't make that pizza without having the water of Naples or New York,' or 'You have to have that special flour.' No you don't.\" </p><p>\n  Like Mssrs. Migoya and Myhrvold, Deborah Cummings and her husband, Don, of Clarkston, Mich., have logged thousands of miles traveling to taste regional pizza styles. But when the pandemic kept them at home, Ms. Cummings's pizza-making efforts kicked into high gear. She bought Breville's Pizzaiolo oven, and dove deeply into Philadelphia chef Joe Beddia's book \"Pizza Camp\" and, more recently, into Anthony Falco's \"Pizza Czar,\" published in May. </p><p>\n  Along with those books, she, like Mr. della Faille and Mr. Commissiong, found inspiration, community and amusement online. After browsing Ooni's message boards she came away thinking that \"those guys are a little intense.\" She, instead spends much of her time on Facebook, \"where the guys are very fixated on the dough hydration,\" but good-natured all the same. \"No one talks down to me. I post pictures. I get lots of great compliments.\" </p><p>\n  Despite 30 years of pizza making, cooking more frequently at home over the last six months has made a difference. \"I've changed quite a bit,\" Ms. Cummings said. \"I'm not so worried about following that recipe.\" </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Pies Page by Page </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Ready to truly master pizza? </p><p>\n  These cookbooks are for you </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  FOR GONZO PIZZAIOLOS </p><p>\n  Pizza Czar: Recipes and Know-How From a World-Traveling Pizza Chef </p><p>\n  After a stint at the influential Brooklyn restaurant Roberta's, Anthony Falco struck out on his own to help open pizzerias from Sao Paulo to Tokyo. He bills himself as an International Pizza Consultant, a title only slightly less grandiose than the one on the cover of his book. Its tone is loose and conversational. The more outre recipes -- like the Buttercrust, a Pizza Hut homage, or the Brazilian Mashed Potato Pizza -- set it apart. $35, Abrams Books </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  FOR ASPIRING ARTISANS </p><p>\n  The Joy of Pizza: Everything You Need to Know </p><p>\n  There are no shortcuts when it comes to developing the kind of discernment Dan Richer brings to his pizzas. Co-authored with Katie Parla and out Nov. 19, his book provides a survey course in evaluating ingredients. QR codes throughout link to videos demonstrating how to stretch dough and other techniques -- a useful addition to already thorough instruction. Recipes come in variations for standard home ovens and high-temperature models. $35, Voracious </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  FOR PIZZA GEEKS </p><p>\n  Modernist Pizza </p><p>\n  Trying to be all things to all people is usually a recipe for failure. But at 1,708 pages, this three-volume set from Nathan Myhrvold and Francisco Migoya manages to be encyclopedia, guidebook, science textbook and cookbook. Nerding out with charts on flour particle size and explanations of the Effect of Sauce Reflectivity on Pizza is fascinating fun for both the professional pizza maker and the science-minded eater. The survey of global pizzerias will make you want to pack your passport and your stretchy pants. $425, The Cooking Lab </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  TOPPING TIPS / BEST-DRESSED PIES FROM PIZZA CHEFS AROUND THE COUNTRY </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  \"My father used to grow scallions in the yard. Chop them up, saute them in some garlic and oil with the sausage. And fresh cherry peppers on pizza? The smell and the taste is ridiculous.\" </p><p>\n  -- Giovanni Lanzo, Luigi's Pizza, Brooklyn </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  \"The creamy mornay with the egg makes it feel like a perfect mack-daddy bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. It's such a stoner pizza.\" </p><p>\n  -- John Hall, Post Office Pies, Birmingham, Ala. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  \"It's like that classic 'pine and swine' combination -- sweet and salty and savory. Find a variety where the grapes are smaller.\" </p><p>\n  -- Sarah Minnick, Lovely's Fifty Fifty, Portland, Ore. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  \"Cooking kimchi brings out the sweetness of the cabbage, tones down the funkiness and tempers the heat of Korean chile flake.\" </p><p>\n  -- Ann Kim, Pizzeria Lola, Minneapolis </p><p></p>",
