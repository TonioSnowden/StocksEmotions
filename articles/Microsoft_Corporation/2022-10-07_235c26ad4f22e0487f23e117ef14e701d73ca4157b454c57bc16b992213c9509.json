  "title": "Donald Trump PAC Jumps Into Ohio, Pennsylvania Senate Races; Former president's new fundraising committee is running ads against Democrats Tim Ryan and John Fetterman as Republicans hope he will spend more of his campaign cash",
  "text": "<p>His Save America PAC had nearly $93 million cash on hand at the end of August; the new ads are from Make America Great Again Inc., a separate super PAC.</p><p>The Pennsylvania ad attacks Democrat John Fetterman, the state's lieutenant governor, accusing him of being weak on crime and criticizing a vote to commute the sentence of a man convicted of stabbing a woman to death. \"John Fetterman is dangerous,\" an ominous-sounding narrator says. </p><p>Mr. Fetterman, who served on the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons, has said he isn't sure whether the man is innocent, but that he wanted to see DNA testing of the weapon.</p><p>Mr. Fetterman is leading Republican Mehmet Oz by more than 6 percentage points, according to the FiveThirtyEight polling average, but the race has tightened in recent weeks. Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Oz, a celebrity doctor, bucking other Republicans who coalesced around former hedge-fund executive Dave McCormick in the primary.</p><p>In Ohio, the ad from MAGA Inc. portrays Ohio Democrat Rep.Tim Ryan as a \"suck up\" to liberal party leaders. Republican J.D. Vance has struggled after winning his party's primary with Mr. Trump's endorsement and trails Mr. Ryan by 1.6 percentage points according to FiveThirtyEight.</p><p>The super PAC will pay for ads in other high-profile contests, according to people familiar with the plans, but details haven't been released. Mr. Trump has endorsed candidates in a number of Senate races, including Nevada and Arizona, where he is scheduled to hold rallies this weekend.</p><p>Taylor Budowich, executive director of MAGA Inc., said Mr. Trump had held numerous rallies and raised money for candidates all over the country, and nearly all of his endorsed candidates won their primaries. \"MAGA Inc. was established to ensure his vision succeeds in 2022 and beyond,\" he said.</p><p>While Republicans are favored by nonpartisan analysts to take control of the House, despite more positive signs for Democrats recently, the Senate is seen as up for grabs. Mr. Trump's endorsements have rankled some Republican leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has cited \"candidate quality\" as a factor in the uncertain takeover prospects.</p><p>Since leaving office, Mr. Trump has amassed a lot of money for Save America PAC, mainly through small dollar donations. But he has spent only a fraction of that on other candidates, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission.</p><p>That money can be transferred to MAGA Inc., which faces fewer restrictions on spending and could be a vehicle for Mr. Trump's own 2024 presidential bid, should he decide to run. He has signaled he will seek a rematch with President Joe Biden, and most polls show him the heavy favorite over other would-be Republicans.</p><p>MAGA Inc. has several staff members who could form a presidential campaign team, including Mr. Budowich, communications adviser Steven Cheung, pollster Tony Fabrizio and strategist Chris LaCivita.</p><p>Write to Alex Leary at alex.leary@wsj.com</p><p>Donald Trump PAC Jumps Into Ohio, Pennsylvania Senate Races</p>",
