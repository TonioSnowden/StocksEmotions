  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to watch:</strong> Several private equity firms including Blackstone, Carlyle and EQT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a3de902-fed1-4453-a284-353cd7447e18\">are considering bids</a> of up to $25bn for Sandoz, the generic drugs business belonging to pharmaceutical company Novartis. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7db818e1-0bd9-4412-b1a0-6409298a1e58\">Go deeper</a> on the situation with Lex.</p> <h2>KPMG ramps up pay for partners in the trenches</h2> <p>On the surface, last year was one to forget for <strong>KPMG</strong>'s UK operations. </p> <p>The professional services firm lost its chair and senior partner <strong>Bill Michael</strong> after a revolt by staff when he told them via video conference to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f569449-d113-48fe-b01a-9153f4c3d593\">“stop moaning”</a> about their working conditions and that unconscious bias was “complete and utter crap”.&#xa0;</p> <p>His interim replacement <strong>Mary O'Connor</strong> also quit after being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0acea9c-3468-4efb-a2de-3daf1aec7b13\">passed over</a> as Michael's permanent replacement. Over the summer, the firm's global boss <strong>Bill Thomas</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec3a7cc6-c968-47e9-8c55-4505d805068c\">got into a row</a> with the UK accounting regulator, which branded the firm's banking audits “unacceptable”.&#xa0;</p> <p>On top of that, an industry tribunal imposed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99b7b8ae-cabd-4a53-ac2d-927dad457f8d\">£13mn fine</a> on KPMG for deliberately pushing a client into insolvency so another potential client, <strong>HIG Capital</strong>, could buy the business without £100mn of pension liabilities. </p> <p>Despite the series of problems, the firm boosted its revenue by 10 per cent to £2.4bn in the year to September 2021, handing its 571 partners their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1654a46-169c-47a6-a27f-955a9b2638f9\">biggest pay cheques</a> since 2014, the FT's Michael O'Dwyer reports. </p> <p>Partners received an average of £688,000, up from £572,000 a year earlier. Their 14,800 rank and file staff shared a £100mn bonus pool. </p> <p>A market <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6dfdd78a-e229-4524-a400-144396524eb6\">sloshing with private equity capital</a> helped KPMG's UK deal advisory practice increase revenues by 31 per cent, far outstripping growth in its larger audit, tax and consulting divisions.</p> <p>“The low interest rate environment has seen private equity players pump cash into the market and this, coupled with the broader operational transformation businesses are going through, has driven a record deal flow,” said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23e31100-0f62-4c8d-a57f-614fb9414860\"><strong>Jon Holt</strong></a>, who took over from O'Connor in April. </p> <p>But as the rising tide of deals work lifted all boats at the Big Four last year, KPMG partners' payday celebrations may be tempered by a glance at their competitors.</p> <p><strong>EY </strong>and <strong>PwC</strong> reported record UK partner pay, averaging £749,000 and £868,000 respectively. <strong>Deloitte </strong>partners were handed £854,000 with a capital distribution from the sale of its restructuring business, taking the total past £1mn. Even mid-tier firm <strong>BDO</strong> paid its partners an average of £760,000. </p> <p>And there's trouble on the horizon still. A tribunal hearing into whether KPMG auditors misled regulators will resume next week and the firm has increased its provision for legal claims and regulatory fines from £92mn to £144mn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Details of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb22432a-ebd1-45ea-8966-0bac7953efd3\">negligence claim</a> by the liquidators of collapsed audit client <strong>Carillion</strong> are expected to become public within days. </p> <p>And with more audit investigations in the pipeline, KPMG's partners may come to reflect that 2021 wasn't so bad after all.</p> <h2>Sony levels up its M&amp;A game</h2> <p><strong>Sony</strong>'s announcement of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f34d42bb-776a-4163-b881-b0ede4f38301\">$3.6bn acquisition</a> of video game developer <strong>Bungie </strong>presents the games industry, and more specifically, the M&amp;A side of the sector, with proof that things have shifted into a new era. </p> <p>The scale of Sony's deal is clearly much smaller than <strong>Microsoft</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b96246ec-e70e-48b6-9a70-fb0800f79bd8\">$75bn play</a> for <strong>Activision</strong>, but they're ultimately driven by the same calculations: when a gaming giant buys a studio these days, the asset on the block isn't just the titles, the pipeline and the talent. It's the community the buyer hopes to acquire.</p> <p>Sony already has in-house expertise in big, narrative-heavy games (<em>Spider-Man, Uncharted, Horizon Zero Dawn</em>). It's less adept at multi-player, multi-platform games that create lucrative communities of gamers, which generate value even after the initial purchase of the product.</p> <p>The larger the community, goes the theory, the more revenue comes in through subscription models and the larger the in-game sales. One big appeal of Bungie is its popular <em>Destiny </em>franchise in which loyal players will shell out for “Silver”, an in-game currency acquired with real-world money. Sony is purchasing the company not only for its initial value, but access to new revenue streams.</p> <p>After Microsoft's mammoth deal was announced, shares in Sony plummeted — the market guessed that either this would deal a heavy blow to the attractiveness of its PlayStation platform (by ultimately making cult classic shooter game<em> Call of Duty</em> exclusively available on Microsoft's Xbox) or would force Sony into a big, overpriced deal to even the score.</p> <p>Sony's Bungie acquisition was clearly in the works long before the Microsoft deal was announced, and actually fits more closely with the way Sony was expected to be handling its acquisitions, say analysts. They say the Japanese electronics group is best off chasing midsized deals (most likely under the $10bn mark) that fill critical strategic gaps rather than emulating expansionist megadeals of its US rivals.</p> <p>The transaction is already the third sizeable takeover in the gaming industry this year, as Lex notes, meaning the M&amp;A game <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a716d01-2405-439a-a047-6e85ca573b30\">could just be getting started</a>.</p> <h2>Could Peltz be back to his matchmaking ways?</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5644e85-b0f7-443d-a949-1ff7d5b33374\"><strong>Nelson Peltz</strong></a> knows how to keep shareholders on their toes.</p> <p>When the billionaire activist quietly built up a stake in <strong>Unilever </strong>earlier this month, onlookers were left wondering what Peltz and his fund <strong>Trian Partners </strong>had in store for the £96bn market cap consumer goods giant. His plans remain a mystery.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Peltz sparked curiosity once more when the New York hedge fund investor and his Trian co-founder <strong>Ed Garden </strong><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/invesco-ltd-announces-changes-to-its-board-of-directors-301472037.html\">stepped down</a> from the board of US asset manager<strong> Invesco </strong>to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6acc30d7-ae37-4d63-9379-0aeb240584e0\">take up seats</a> at its rival <strong>Janus Henderson</strong>.</p> <p>Peltz, who had built stakes in both money managers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b01c9c4-a49a-4072-b385-a56cb27b9d4a\">in 2020</a>, had hinted at “certain strategic combinations” for both firms from the jump, fuelling speculation that a marriage between the two was in the works.</p> <p>Could Peltz be looking to revive such a deal? </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2429963d-34af-4cbd-9bd1-ea9cf22d5ae2\">Failed merger discussions</a> between Invesco and <strong>State Street</strong>'s $3.9tn asset management business means the former is available. But the investor's attempt at playing matchmaker between the two <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ced6254a-8c31-47de-b784-4ce19683993f\">caught a lot of flak</a> the first time round.</p> <p>Both asset managers had previously done deals to build scale in a swiftly-consolidating industry — Invesco <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d6c509a-d2c9-11e8-a9f2-7574db66bcd5\">bought</a> <strong>OppenheimerFunds </strong>for $5.7bn the previous year, while Janus Henderson was the product of a merger of Anglo-Australian asset manager <strong>Henderson </strong>with US-based <strong>Janus</strong> —&#xa0; neither of which resulted in exceptional performance.</p> <p>Regardless, it's no secret that Peltz is a proponent of more consolidation in the asset management industry, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8efae950-af00-475d-90ba-d09b6efd39e7\">faces</a> rising costs and downward pressure on fees. </p> <p>The past four years have hailed megadeals such as <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/635db026-2e71-4b39-b703-c7233074c84b\">$7bn</a> purchase of <strong>Eaton Vance</strong> and<strong> Franklin Templeton</strong>'s $6.5bn acquisition of <strong>Legg Mason</strong> which initiated both into the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9621add4-d6d2-11e8-ab8e-6be0dcf18713\">$1tn-in-assets club</a>. Then there is the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4268dd8-7c5b-4821-8079-be53c35fb5d0\">rising threat</a> of passive investment titans<strong> BlackRock</strong> and <strong>Vanguard</strong>.</p> <p>Whatever Peltz plans to do now that he and Garden have swapped their seats at Invesco for ones at the chronically underperforming Janus, it won't hurt to have spent time sitting in both boardrooms.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Evercore</strong> has hired <strong>David Lischer</strong> as a senior managing director in its debt advisory practice. He joins from <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> has hired <strong>Jacquelyn Kasulis </strong>as a partner in New York.
