  "title": "U.S. News:  FTC Faces Test on 'Vertical' Mergers  ----  By Brent Kendall and Dave Michaels",
  "text": "<p>   In challenging Microsoft Corp.'s $75 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc., the Federal Trade Commission is building its marquee antitrust case of Chair Lina Khan's tenure on expansive legal theories that haven't prevailed in other recent cases. </p><p>   The lawsuit targets a so-called vertical merger that would combine Microsoft's software, devices and cloud-computing business with Activision's library of blockbuster videogames. The FTC argues the deal would give Microsoft the incentive and ability to degrade or withhold Activision's content on rival systems, principally hurting Sony, its major competitor. </p><p>   In the typical antitrust case, the government challenges a horizontal merger, or one involving rivals that compete head-to-head. Such mergers, by removing a competitor from the marketplace, can increase concentration, a factor that can be used to infer harmful future effects such as higher prices. </p><p>   The government has struggled to win cases on vertical mergers because making claims about the potential future harms posed by such deals is less straightforward and can require complex speculation about how market forces might play out. U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, presiding in 2018 over the Justice Department's landmark -- and unsuccessful -- challenge to AT&amp;T's proposed vertical acquisition of Time Warner, described one of the government's central legal theories as a \"Rube Goldberg contraption.\" </p><p>   Government agencies have historically policed vertical mergers less forcefully than horizontal ones, under the theory that vertically integrated companies can offer lower prices or better products, including through increased efficiency. Microsoft could, for instance, lower the price for its Xbox gaming console because it profits from selling Activision's games. </p><p>   Still, antitrust officials under both Democratic and Republican administrations have recognized some vertical transactions may unlawfully suppress competition. Such harms could come if a merged firm deters the rest of the industry from innovating or denies resources needed by rivals. </p><p>   Predicting a vertical deal's effects is tricky, and antitrust authorities don't have the analytical tools to reliably do it, said Michael Salinger, a professor at Boston University and a former FTC chief economist.\"The models are not precise enough to nail down which way the effects go,\" Dr. Salinger said. \"I think they are going to have a tough time in court.\" </p><p>   Microsoft, which values the deal at $68.7 billion after adjusting for Activision's net cash, has said it would give Sony and others access to Activision games. </p><p>   Court challenges to vertical mergers have become more likely as antitrust agencies have grown less willing to accept upfront settlements that permit deals to close but put limits on the merged company's future behavior, said Barry Nigro, a partner at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson LLP. </p><p>   There is less case law to support vertical-merger challenges, but the FTC and Justice Department can change that only by taking more cases to court, Mr. Nigro said. </p><p>   The FTC's move under Ms. Khan to block the deal isn't surprising, given her history of criticizing what she views as worrisome levels of dominance by a handful of giant technology companies. A divided FTC under Ms. Khan last year withdrew previous guidelines on how antitrust enforcers should view vertical mergers, believing they weren't tough enough. Republican commissioners dissented. </p><p>   Yet the FTC's arguments against the Microsoft deal in many ways resemble those made by the Trump-era Justice Department when it sued to block the AT&amp;T-Time Warner deal in 2017. The department argued the merger would give AT&amp;T the power to suppress competition because it would be a top distributor of pay-TV service as well as the owner of top content. </p><p>   Under the Justice Department's theory, AT&amp;T would have the ability to hobble cable-TV rivals by charging higher prices to carry programming from Time Warner's networks, or withhold it from the networks altogether. </p><p>   The AT&amp;T case was the first litigated vertical merger challenge in 40 years -- and the Justice Department's loss before Judge Leon was lopsided. </p><p>   A handful of other vertical challenges brought since then have met a similar fate. The FTC last year sued to block Illumina Inc.'s planned $7.1 billion acquisition of Grail Inc., a company developing an early stage cancer-detection test, arguing the vertical deal would diminish innovation in the market for such tests. </p><p>   The government has prevailed in some investigations of vertical deals after showing the muscle and will to bring the cases to court. Lockheed Martin Corp. and Nvidia Corp. both abandoned planned acquisitions of suppliers this year after the FTC filed suit to block their deals. </p><p>   The FTC is also seeking to prevent Meta Platforms Inc. from buying virtual reality startup Within Unlimited Inc., with proceedings kicking off this week in a California federal court. </p><p></p>",
