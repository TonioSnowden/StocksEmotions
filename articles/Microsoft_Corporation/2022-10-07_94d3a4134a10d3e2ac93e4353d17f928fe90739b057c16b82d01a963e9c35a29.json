  "title": "U.S. News:  Trump PAC Airs GOP Attack Ads in Two States  ----  By Alex Leary",
  "text": "<p>   Donald Trump is jumping into the midterm-election ad wars with a pair of spots in the hotly contested Pennsylvania and Ohio Senate races, the first wave in what is expected to be millions of dollars in spending from the former president's new political-action committee. </p><p>   Mr. Trump, who has faced pressure to use his fundraising resources to help Republican candidates, had before this week spent modestly -- and not on TV ads for candidates. He preferred instead to stage boisterous rallies in battleground states. </p><p>   His Save America PAC had nearly $93 million cash on hand at the end of August; the new ads are from Make America Great Again Inc., a separate super PAC. </p><p>   The Pennsylvania ad attacks Democrat John Fetterman, the state's lieutenant governor, accusing him of being weak on crime and a criticizing a vote to commute the sentence of a man convicted of stabbing a woman to death. \"John Fetterman is dangerous,\" a narrator says. </p><p>   Mr. Fetterman, who served on the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons, has said he isn't sure whether the man is innocent, but that he wanted to see DNA testing of the weapon. </p><p>   Mr. Fetterman is leading Republican Mehmet Oz by more than 6 percentage points, according to the FiveThirtyEight polling average, but the race has tightened in recent weeks. Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Oz, a celebrity doctor, bucking other Republicans who coalesced around former hedge-fund executive Dave McCormick in the primary. </p><p>   In Ohio, the ad from MAGA Inc. portrays Ohio Democrat Rep. Tim Ryan as a \"suck up\" to liberal party leaders. Republican J.D. Vance has struggled after winning his party's primary with Mr. Trump's endorsement and trails Mr. Ryan by 1.6 percentage points according to FiveThirtyEight. </p><p>   The super PAC will pay for ads in other high-profile contests, according to people familiar with the plans, but details haven't been released. Mr. Trump has endorsed candidates in a number of Senate races, including Nevada and Arizona, where he is scheduled to hold rallies this weekend. </p><p>   Taylor Budowich, executive director of MAGA Inc., said Mr. Trump had held numerous rallies and raised money for candidates all over the country. </p><p>   David Bergstein, spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in response to the ads: \"Senate Republicans have had a terrible start to October, and nothing will distract voters from the disqualifying personal and political vulnerabilities of their candidates in these races.\" </p><p>   Since leaving office, Mr. Trump has amassed a lot of money for Save America PAC, mainly through small dollar donations. He has spent only a fraction of that on other candidates, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. </p><p></p>",
