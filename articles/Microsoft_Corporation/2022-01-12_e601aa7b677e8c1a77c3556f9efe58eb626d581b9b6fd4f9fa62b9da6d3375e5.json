  "text": "<p>It's called grayscale. With a few clicks in the \"accessibility\" tab on MacBooks and iPhones or a few taps in the settings of an Android or PC, a phone or computer can become as interesting as a black-and-white television.</p><p>It isn't only push notifications and vibrations that cause our addiction to smartphones: Colors draw our attention, and certain ones can cause a dopamine release. The blue themes of Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook, not to mention the blue Apple uses for iMessages, entrance us.</p><p>Humans really like looking at blue, which makes sense, because the sky is light blue on clear days. Until I set all my digital devices to grayscale, I never realized that compared with the sky, iMessage's blue looks sickeningly artificial. In grayscale, meanwhile, photos and videos have the same intrigue as C-Span at midnight.</p><p>A boring phone will likely cause greater use of a laptop to watch videos and look at social media in full color. I recommend grayscaling laptops and monitors too. Many people are colorblind, so most applications are designed to function without color. In theory, most people who work on a computer could perform their tasks in grayscale, as I do.</p><p>If you're at all worried about your excessive smartphone use, make your digital life look like Dorothy's Kansas, and let the real world be stunning as Oz.</p><p>Mr. Naida is an assistant editorial features editor at the Journal.</p><p>The Case for Grayscale Mode</p>",
