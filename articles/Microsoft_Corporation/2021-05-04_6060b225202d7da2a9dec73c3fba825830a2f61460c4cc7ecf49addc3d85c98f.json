  "text": "<p>Melinda Gates has called on wealthy nations to stop “hoarding” coronavirus vaccines, saying it was disappointing how little was being done to prevent the pandemic from ravaging the developing world.</p> <p>The US philanthropist told the Financial Times that developed countries should vaccinate their populations only “up to a point” before they donate supplies to those in greater need. </p> <p>“You don't need to vaccinate all the way down, say, to your teen population . . . before you send out vaccine doses,” Gates said in a pre-recorded interview with editor Roula Khalaf for the FT's three-day Global Boardroom event.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e2b2bc93-7e36-4d7e-8a33-ab9abc65c64a.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>“It's incredibly unfortunate” that low-income nations were not receiving more shots, Gates said. Some “can't even vaccinate their healthcare workers”.</p> <p>Covax, the World Health Organization-backed mechanism to help poorer nations access Covid-19 drugs, needed $2bn in extra funding and more vaccine supplies, she said.</p> <p>While she acknowledged leaders in the west were under domestic political pressure to protect their own citizens, Gates added there was a practical as well as a moral case for them to donate supplies. </p> <p>“It benefits all of us to have the global economy reopen,” she said. </p> <p>The former Microsoft executive added that while research and development of the vaccines had been remarkably successful, the global system for manufacturing them was “not working” and had created bottlenecks. </p> <p>“We need to have manufacturing in far more places around the world so that we can get it [the supply] out and you don't have this hoarding problem that we're seeing right now.”</p> <p>The interview was recorded before Melinda and Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder, announced they were ending their marriage after 27 years.</p> <p>The couple have ploughed much of their estimated $124bn fortune into the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which seeks to enhance healthcare and reduce poverty around the world.</p><p>Source: Alistair Gray 2021 'Melinda Gates urges wealthy nations to stop ‘hoarding' Covid vaccines' FT.com 4 May.
