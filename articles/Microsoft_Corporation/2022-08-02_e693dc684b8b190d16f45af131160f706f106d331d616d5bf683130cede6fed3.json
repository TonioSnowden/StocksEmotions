  "title": "Technology:  Activision Records  Earnings Drop as  Gamers Pull Back  ----  By Denny Jacob",
  "text": "<p>    Activision Blizzard Inc.'s sales and earnings fell in the second quarter, the latest indicator that pandemic-fueled growth is slowing as consumers are limiting their spending in response to record inflation. </p><p>   The videogame company, which in January agreed to be acquired by Microsoft Corp. for $75 billion, recorded $1.64 billion in sales, a roughly 28% decrease from $2.3 billion in sales in 2021. </p><p>   The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company posted $280 million in net income for the three months ended June 30, down from $876 million in the same period a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet expected $410.6 million. </p><p>   Stripped of certain items such as expenses related to share-based compensation, adjusted earnings were 48 cents a share, down from $1.20 a share in the year-ago period, matching analysts' expectations. </p><p>   A deal between Microsoft and Activision would continue the software company's ascent as a powerhouse in the business-computing sector and a rising giant in videogames under Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella's leadership. </p><p>   Microsoft rushed into a deal after The Wall Street Journal reported that Activision CEO Bobby Kotick knew about allegations of employee misconduct at the company but didn't brief the board. </p><p>   Activision has said the Journal's reporting created a misleading picture of the company. Mr. Kotick has said he is transparent with his board, which issued a statement supporting him. </p><p>   Mr. Kotick, who is expected to leave after the acquisition is complete, could walk away with as much as $520 million. The deal is expected to close in mid-2023. </p><p>   Another major development at Activision has taken place in recent months: In May, a small number of workers at one of Activision's studios voted in favor of unionizing with the Communications Workers of America, a first for a major U.S. videogame publisher. </p><p>   A sense of how the broader videogame market is faring is expected to become clearer on Tuesday with results from the latest quarter from competitor Electronic Arts Inc. </p><p></p>",
