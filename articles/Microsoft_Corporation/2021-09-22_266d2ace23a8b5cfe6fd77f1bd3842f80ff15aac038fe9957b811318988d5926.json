  "text": "<p>Some companies declined to participate. They included Starbucks Corp. and Microsoft Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. A Microsoft spokeswoman declined to comment. A Starbucks spokesman didn't comment.</p><p>The statement doesn't call for any specific action. Its organizers say it is intended, in part, to show other states considering new abortion laws that they can cause economic harm, such as by hindering employers' ability to recruit workers from out of state.</p><p>Many of the signatories aren't based in Texas, though a number of them have operations or employees in the state.</p><p>For some companies, the statement represents their first public comments on the Texas law. Many employers have been largely silent since it went into effect this month. Some worried about taking a stand on the issue, fearing potential blowback from customers or employees, executives said.</p><p>Gov. Greg Abbott has said that businesses aren't turned off by the state's policies.</p>",
