  "text": "<p>   Email security company Abnormal Security Corp. has raised $210 million in a Series C funding round led by Insight Partners. </p><p>   Based in San Francisco, Abnormal uses machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence to detect potential cyberattacks launched through cloud-based email systems such as Microsoft Corp.'s Office 365 or Alphabet Inc.'s Gmail. These include targeted and social-engineering attacks and business email compromise attempts. They also include supply-chain infiltrations, where hacker emails might not include typical nefarious elements, such as malware attachments or malicious links. </p><p>   The company's funding round also saw participation from venture capital investors Greylock Partners and Menlo Ventures. </p><p></p>",
