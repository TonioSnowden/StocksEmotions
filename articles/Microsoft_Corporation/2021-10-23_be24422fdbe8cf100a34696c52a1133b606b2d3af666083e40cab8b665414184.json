  "text": "<p>   It's not just economic factors at play in this gloomy assessment. There is also a real difference between generations in the frequency of mental health disorders, particularly among young women. A 2019 study by Dr. Twenge shows that the proportion of U.S. adolescents reporting symptoms consistent with major depression in the last 12 months increased from 8.7% in 2005 to 13.2% in 2017. There were no corresponding increases among other age groups over this period, suggesting that the cause might lie in the growing centrality of smartphones and social media among the young. And early signs are that the Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced this gap. For example, a shocking 40% of 18 to 21-year-olds in the U.K. reported mental health conditions in January 2021, much higher than other age groups. </p><p>   When there is such richness in the realities, why are there so many myths? It's partly a product of a new mini-industry of generational market research and consulting, which plays to executives' anxiety that they don't have their fingers on the pulse. In 2016 The Wall Street Journal reported that, by one estimate, U.S. companies spent up to $70 million on \"generational consulting\" the previous year, while more than 400 LinkedIn users described themselves solely as a \"Millennial expert\" or \"Millennial consultant.\" </p><p>   Politicians also play to generational differences, with Barack Obama repeatedly lionizing coming generations as more focused on equality. In his autobiography \"A Promised Land,\" Mr. Obama writes that he remains hopeful because of his faith in his fellow citizens, \"especially those of the next generation, whose conviction in the equal worth of all people seems to come as second nature, and who insist on making real those principles that their parents and teachers told them were true but perhaps never fully believed themselves.\" The evidence does not suggest such a clean break. </p><p>   The problem with such statements isn't the idea of generational difference itself but rather how generational labels are applied. A more accurate understanding of those differences would help to reduce conflict at home, at work and in politics. It would remind us that generations don't have utterly distinct and unchanging characteristics. People and societies change over the long term in ways that no stereotype about age cohorts can begin to capture. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Duffy is a professor of public policy and director of the Policy Institute at King's College London. This essay is adapted from his new book, \"The Generation Myth: Why When You're Born Matters Less Than You Think,\" which will be published on Nov. 9 by Basic Books. </p><p></p>",
