  "title": "What to Wear to an Interview: Advice for Candidates—and Bosses; The rules of interview attire have changed. Men on both sides of the desk in three industries divulge how you should dress for success—and what you should avoid.",
  "text": "<p>CROCODILE loafers? Asics? Crocs? Many of us are still befuddled by what to wear in the newly reconstituted professional world. While some companies have transitioned back into regular office routines, many continue to run on a hybrid work-from-wherever model. This in-flux culture further complicates the already stressful process of interviewing and makes a critical question—how to dress for it—even more confounding. And in a job market where candidates have more leverage than ever, even the interviewers suddenly feel like they need to analyze their fashion choices.</p><p>The trend of the last two years has been casualization, for both in-person and on-screen evaluations. A Zoom interview is not an invitation to log on in your PJs, but what about an immaculately unstained T-shirt? And will sporting your best business formal secure an offer or just make you seem uptight and overeager?</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's your preferred interview outfit in 2022? Join the conversation below.</p><p>A little LinkedIn stalkingto suss out how senior or buttoned-up an interviewer might be would behoove any job candidate. If you're meeting with a septuagenarian BigLaw partner, a full suit could earn approval. But if you're interviewing with someone a little greener at, say, a consulting firm, you can safely skip the tie and cuff links. \"By shifting the focus away from those decidedly conservative accessories, I think it reads a little more modern,\" said Turner Allen, a personal stylist and image consultant based in New York City. He suggests polished pieces you would wear in your everyday life—things that seamlessly go from your interview to your lunch plans to picking up the kids at school. Bosses should also heed this advice and consider what kind of work culture they want their clothes to project.</p><p>A crisp polo shirt is often a reasonable gamble, but a simple, well-fitting Oxford button-down is foolproof. You can easily amp it up with a tie or sweater if more formality is in order, but it also says, \"Hey, I'm relaxed. Confident. Not trying too hard.\" Consider an Oxford in colors other than white and blue or an approachable pattern (a subtle check, stripe or micro-dot). According to Mr. Allen, that conveys that you can be \"creative and adaptable—two traits employers tend to look for.\" But unless you're interviewing for a position at a kid-friendly candy store, don't get too crazy—paisleys and big, pink polka dots might be creative, but they'll also give your prospective boss a migraine.</p><p>All that said, every situation and industry is different. For a broader perspective, we asked three seasoned interviewers and three recently employed interviewees in three different fields what job candidates and managers have been wearing lately—and what they should have done better.</p><p>GOVERNMENT ORDINANCE</p><p>The Boss: Jordan Maynard, 33, Boston, Chief Secretary to the Governor</p><p>The Tale: I've conducted over 1,000 interviews in my three-plus years in the Governor's office. Prepandemic, I definitely expected the traditional suit-and-tie situation. Lately, I'm seeing more and more candidates wear sweaters instead of a dress shirt. And honestly I would not expect a full suit for a Zoom interview when somebody is sitting in their house. Last week, this young man in his early 20s came into the office for an interview, and I noticed he had a colorful Southern Tide tie, boat shoes and no socks. It's nice to have personality, but maybe wear socks.</p><p>The Tip: You can skip the suit, but I recommend wearing colorful socks. I like it when a candidate's personality comes through on their feet.</p><p>The Candidate: Tony Richards, 37, Boston, VP Equitable Business Development</p><p>The Tale: Once I did a Zoom interview and the interviewer had a red gingham shirt on. It was so distracting for the whole meeting—all those squares! I think we've learned over the last two years that perception matters in a different way. Aesthetics matter in a different way. We're all rearranging our home office areas to seem less distracting on camera, so why not do the same with what you're wearing?</p><p>The Tip: I have four button-ups in rotation for when I have to do interviews. White-based, maybe with a blue check or stripe pattern. If you're a manager conducting an interview in a fuchsia shirt, it could be distracting.</p><p>RULES OF LAW</p><p>The Boss: Ru Bhatt, 40, New York, Partner at a Legal Recruiting Firm</p><p>The Tale: I speak with job candidates daily, and I coach them as to what they should wear to their law-firm interviews. I recently had this candidate who was great on paper but kept striking out, so I asked him to come to my office dressed as he would for an interview. He came in this ill-fitting suit with stains on it. I had to give him some very frank advice, and that was a tough situation. But the next interview, after he cleaned up his look, he got an offer.</p><p>The Tip: It's always good to wear a clean navy blazer with a nice shirt. Make sure it's ironed. For all these Zoom interviews, you only have your shoulders and head on screen, so you have to make them count.</p><p>The Candidate: Bradley Simon, 32, New York, Attorney</p><p>The Tale: I used to always wear suits to in-person interviews. But now with Zoom interviews, there are always times when someone's kid runs by the camera, or their dog starts barking, or you log on and your interviewer is wearing an embroidered polo shirt from their kid's high school or yacht club. Once I logged on and the person was at his summer home with a bunch of these trophy fish mounted in the background—that was pretty surprising. It's all about learning to steer the conversation based on what's on the screen, and what you wear shouldn't get in the way of that.</p><p>The Tip: You don't want to go too live and dangerous on an initial interview and have that be your first impression. Don't reinvent the wheel. Personally, I still like to wear ties—so interviewers should stick to a solid color like red or blue. Keep the flashy ties for weddings and events with friends.</p><p>TECH SUPPORT</p><p>The Boss: Jon Wilson, 32, New York, VP Strategy and Corporate Development</p><p>The Tale: You see more casual dress these days because in this market, the candidates have the power. There have been moments when the candidate forgets about the interview, so when they get on Zoom they aren't prepared. You see them in graphic tees with spicy language. A full-blown suit is not required or expected in tech, but a graphic tee for an interview strikes me as surprising.</p><p>The Tip: When I see folks really buttoned-up, it can come across as nervous. I want people to be themselves. A polo shirt or a henley makes sense.</p><p>The Candidate: Grant Evans, 28, New York, Partnerships</p><p>The Tale: I come from an investment banking background, where suits and business casual were the norm. So when I was interviewing in tech, I wore a collared shirt. But there were a couple times when my interviewers wore college sweatshirts, which actually put me at ease. There's this ethos that you can wear whatever you want, augmented by the fact that everyone was working from home. Ultimately no one really cares what you're wearing—they care more about the environment you're creating in the workplace.</p><p>The Tip: I love Lululemon T-shirts. They're comfortable, they look clean and nice. And they hit that mark of not being too dressy, but they also don't, for instance, have a sports logo on them. A lot of times an interviewer is speaking to you from their home. People have the right to wear a T-shirt if that's what they wear in their house.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
