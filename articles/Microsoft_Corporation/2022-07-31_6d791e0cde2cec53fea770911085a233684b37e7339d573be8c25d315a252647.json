  "title": "China Home Sales Plunge in July, as Mortgage Revolt Deters Buyers; Sales fell on the year and from the previous month, ending a budding recovery",
  "text": "<p>July sales were down 28.6% from June, ending a two-month recovery in month-to-month sales growth. Apartment sales showed increases in May and June from the previous months, as activity picked up following Covid lockdowns in Shanghai and other Chinese cities earlier this year.</p><p>China's private-sector property developers went on a yearslong, debt-fueled building boom, selling homes before they were built, until a funding crisis that began last year led to defaults and stalled projects. Buyers who typically sank large down payments into those homes have been venting their frustrations all summer.</p><p>China's home sales often experience a lull in July, because developers rush to book sales in June to meet first-half targets. But analysts said the main drag on activity this time has been the mortgage revolt and its impact on would-be buyers' confidence.</p><p>The revolt started at the end of June at an Evergrande project in Jingdezhen, in central China's Jiangxi province, where frustrated home buyers threatened to renege on mortgages on unfinished properties. Hundreds of buyers from roughly 320 projects across the country had followed suit as of July 29, according to a tally of statements from homeowners who said they will stop paying their mortgages circulating on GitHub, a Microsoft Corp.-owned coding-collaboration site.</p><p>Home buyers—some waving signs saying \"Construction stops and mortgage stops!\"—say the threat to halt payments is the only way to get their voices heard as projects stall and delivery times drag out. A broadly slowing economy that is biting into employment and incomes is adding to the pressure. Some buyers say they are increasingly unwilling to keep paying for a home they aren't sure they will ever receive.</p><p>Week-over-week data put together earlier by CRIC to study the impact of the mortgage revolt had signaled the July decline. In 30 cities CRIC determined to have been seriously affected by the revolt, new home sales dropped by 12% in the week ended July 10 from the week before, then fell 41% in the week ended July 17.</p><p>More home buyers are choosing second-hand homes or new ones built by state-owned developers, which are typically in a stronger financial position.</p><p>Pressure on the government is building, but hopes for a large real-estate rescue package from Beijing remain unrealized. The Politburo, China's top policy-making body, made clear recently that local governments are ultimately responsible for fixing the property woes in their markets.</p><p>Budget-strapped local authorities have strained to boost property demand, resorting to increasingly creative measures. Dozens of cities have lowered down payments and interest rates. Some are offering outright cash subsidies. Others have announced relief funds for cash-strapped developers or plans to take over troubled projects.</p><p>\"But the sector won't stabilize if developers' liquidity crunch is not relieved,\" said Song Hongwei, a research director of Tongce Research Institute, which tracks and analyzes China's real-estate market.</p><p>On Friday, troubled property developer China Evergrande Group sketched out the contours of a plan to restructure its billions of dollars in debt and said its contracted apartment sales in the first six months of the year had fallen about 97% from the same period a year earlier.</p><p>Write to Cao Li at li.cao@wsj.com</p><p>China Home Sales Plunge in July, as Mortgage Revolt Deters Buyers</p>",
