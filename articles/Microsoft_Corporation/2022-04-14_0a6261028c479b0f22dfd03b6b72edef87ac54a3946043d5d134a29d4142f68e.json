  "title": "Technology:  California Fires Lawyer  Involved in Activision Suit  ----  By Allison Prang",
  "text": "<p>   California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office fired a lawyer involved in the workplace-misconduct lawsuit against videogame company Activision Blizzard Inc., prompting a second attorney to quit in protest, according to a lawyer representing both attorneys. </p><p>    Janette Wipper, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing's chief counsel, was told by Mr. Newsom's office on March 29 that she was being fired, according to a statement from Alexis Ronickher, Ms. Wipper's attorney. </p><p>   Ms. Wipper's last day at the department was Wednesday and she is evaluating her legal avenues, including a claim under the California Whistleblower Protection Act, the statement said. </p><p>   The department's assistant chief counsel, Melanie Proctor, resigned in protest of Ms. Wipper's firing, the statement from Ms. Ronickher, who is also her lawyer, said. Ms. Proctor's resignation was effective Wednesday. </p><p>   Bloomberg News earlier reported that Ms. Proctor had accused Mr. Newsom's office of meddling in the Activision case, citing an email Ms. Proctor had sent to staff. </p><p>   \"Claims of interference by our office are categorically false,\" said Erin Mellon, a spokeswoman for Mr. Newsom, in an email. Activision didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   DFEH Director Kevin Kish said that his department \"has litigated groundbreaking cases that are a model of effective government enforcement of civil rights. \"We continue to do so with the full support of the administration,\" he said. </p><p>   The day Ms. Wipper was told she was being terminated was the same day a California judge approved an $18 million settlement between Activision and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. </p><p>   The EEOC had been investigating the company for sexual-harassment and retaliation allegations. The company had agreed last year to settle with the agency, but the two entities became locked in a monthslong legal battle with the DFEH. That agency said its lawsuit against Activision could be ruined by the EEOC case. </p><p>   The exits at the state agency come amid a lawsuit that it filed last summer against Activision, alleging female employees got fewer opportunities to advance and were paid less than their male counterparts. </p><p>    Microsoft Corp. agreed this year to buy Activision for $75 billion. </p><p></p>",
