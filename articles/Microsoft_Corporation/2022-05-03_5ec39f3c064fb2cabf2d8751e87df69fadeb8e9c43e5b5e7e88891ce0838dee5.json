  "text": "<p>* Shares of Teladoc Health Inc. TDOC closed at $83.72 on Dec. 31, 2019, then rose as much as 252% to $294.54 through the close on Feb. 8, 2021, after which they fell 89% through April 29, 2022, when they closed at $33.76. (All price changes in this article exclude dividends.)</p><p>* Zoom Video Communications Inc. ZM rose 735% from $68.04 at the end of 2019 through a closing high of $568.34 on Oct. 19, 2020, before falling 82% through the close at $99.57 on April 29. The stock is still held by Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation ETF ARKK, which has had its own pandemic boom-and-bust cycle, including a 50% decline in 2022 through April, following last year's 24% decline.</p><p>* Another pandemic high-flyer, Peloton Interactive Inc. PTON, rose 490% from $28.40 at the end of 2019 to $167.42 on Jan. 13, 2021, but then plunged 90% through its close at $17.56 on April 22. At the end of 2019, Peloton was the smallest of these three companies, with a market capitalization of just over $1 billion.</p><p>It turns out that Teladoc is not listed on the Nasdaq — it is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>So our initial screen encompassed all stocks listed on both exchanges. Then, in light of Peloton's market value before the pandemic began, we narrowed the list to companies with market caps of $1 billion or more at the end of 2019.</p><p>Since part of the data presented below makes use of consensus estimates among analysts working for brokerage firms, we further limited the group to companies covered by at least five analysts polled by FactSet. That brought the list down to 1,608 stocks.</p><p>Stocks that were hit the hardest</p><p>Among the 1,608 stocks in the screen, these 26 rose at least 300% through their pandemic closing highs, after which they fell at least 70%.
