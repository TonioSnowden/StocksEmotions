  "title": "Inside View:  When to Invest in a Stupid Idea  ----  By Andy Kessler",
  "text": "<p>   When I read that technology can construct an image of your face from your DNA, my initial reaction was: That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Fortunately, I've had a lifetime of stupidest-things-I've-heard things (like Bleep) became reality. Like the Kubler-Ross stages of grief -- denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance -- technology goes through similar phases. </p><p>   My phases of techno-hype: Incredulous. Will never happen. Dread. I'll try it. Booster. Overhype. Failed expectations. On to the next paradigm. Understand these before plunking money into passing fancies. </p><p>   We know the famous will-never-happen predictions. IBM's Thomas Watson: \"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.\" Digital's Ken Olsen: \"There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.\" Funny now, but not unreasonable at the time. </p><p>   I've learned to harness those knee-jerk denials when I know that technology performance will increase and costs decrease. Classic scale. I'm actually suspicious of things that aren't controversial from the start. I live in those denial phases -- ask my wife. Why? Because almost every time, no one believes in the future. That's the time to invest. Until everyone believes it and then some. Then it's probably time to sell. </p><p>   Think of the 2007 iPhone introduction. Typing on glass, are you kidding me? So many white-collar warriors hurdling through airports were thumb-writing on BlackBerrys -- aka Crackberrys. Take away my keyboard, even though it's tiny and painful to use? Over my dead body. Well, we know how that turned out. BlackBerry is now worth $5 billion. Apple a bit more. </p><p>   Same for electric cars. It's my God-given right to guzzle gas and shift gears with abandon. I don't want a car that works like a high school electronics lab with a battery and a fan. No way. Yet batteries got cheaper, and range went up. </p><p>   It wasn't that long ago that everyone was dubious of autonomous cars. The 2005 Darpa Grand Challenge saw Stanley, a Stanford robot, win $2 million in a 132-mile self-driving race. But on real streets with bicyclists and old ladies? No way. Well, we're not there yet, but it's certainly accepted that it will happen. </p><p>   The stock market allocates capital to those ideas it believes are winners. Remember investing guru Benjamin Graham's stock market as a short-run voting machine, long-run weighing machine? So where are we now -- especially amid a Fed-fueled feeding frenzy? When markets overpay, they're voting that all that good stuff is practically guaranteed to happen. Huge expectations are built into many stock prices. </p><p>   Entrepreneurs, naturally, love the overhype stage -- almost free money thrown at them at billion-dollar valuations. But it's the most dangerous time for investors. HBO has a show named \"Euphoria.\" It's about teen drug use, but no matter; the show's best line is by the main character, Rue: \"Every time I feel good, I think it will last forever . . . but it doesn't.\" </p><p>   Expectations eventually get dashed. Reality bites. Stocks come down. Even if the market or product ends up successful, I've noticed that overhyped stocks can return to their peak values, but five to 10 years later. That's a long time to wait for hype to become real. </p><p>   Take Quantumscape, which went public via a SPAC and produces solid-state lithium metal batteries. Bill Gates and Volkswagen are investors. In 2020 it had no revenue and lost more than $1 billion. Quantumscape had a peak valuation of $50 billion last December. Now it's $13.5 billion. It could work. I hope it does work. But unless something radical changes, I think it will take a long time for the company to be worth $50 billion again. </p><p>   There are plenty of overhyped things to choose from, many with zero revenue. Some may be successful, others certainly won't: Air taxis (Archer and Joby). Hydroponic vertical farms (AeroFarms). Space travel (Momentus). Gamestop's turnaround. </p><p>   My advice is always to invest in the fog. When everyone else is incredulous, look for scale. Usually, no one else can see it. Squint hard, but don't make stuff up. If you can see something that everyone dismisses, and that will get cheaper over a long period of time, maybe decades, buy in cheap and go along for the long ride. Others will eventually overpay. </p><p>   On the flip side, when the fog clears and we've moved from the acceptance to hype, it's time to unload your shares to those late to the party. One hint is that stocks are now worth twice gross domestic product. You might sell early. So what? No one ever lost money taking a profit. But please, know which phase we're in -- don't be the last one in the pool. Instead, start hunting for the next wave no one believes in. </p><p>   But constructing a face from DNA? That'll never happen. Well, maybe . . . </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Write to kessler@wsj.com </p><p></p>",
