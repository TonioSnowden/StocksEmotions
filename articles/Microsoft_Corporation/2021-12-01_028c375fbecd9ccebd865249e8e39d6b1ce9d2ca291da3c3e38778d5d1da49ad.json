  "text": "<p>Blue Prism shareholders needed a bidding war. Now they have got one. Competition for the UK robotic automation software company heated up on Wednesday with a<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c421eb0-33b5-4eaf-852b-78a896d28c0b\"> bid</a> from SS&amp;C Technologies. The US tech group's cash offer values the target at just over £1.2bn, a hair above the price that rival Vista Equity Partners put on the table. </p> <p>Shares traded above the level of the latest bid. That suggests there is more to come. But do not expect investors in Blue Prism, yet another UK business disappearing from the London market, to celebrate too loudly. </p> <p>The UK's junior Aim served Blue Prism well from its 2016 listing until the beginning of this year. But a slowdown in sales growth and closer scrutiny of management targets has weighed heavily on shares. Large fundraisings by US rivals have stoked fears of competitive pressure. </p> <p>Even trading above the latest offer price, Blue Prism shares remain a third below highs from the start of the year. The rival bidders are unlikely to go that high.</p> <p>Private equity group Vista does seem certain to counterbid. If it matches SS&amp;C's 25p increase, success at £13 a share would represent a multiple of just over 6 times 2022 expected revenues. </p> <p>Despite having drifted lower since their April US IPO, shares in rival UiPath are trading at 25 times next year's sales. SoftBank-backed Automation Anywhere is planning to go public next year. On average peers are trading at 9 times sales.</p> <p>Lofty valuations reflect strong demand for robotic process automation software, an industry growing at about 20 per cent annually. The list of potential Blue Prism suitors is long and includes giants such as Microsoft and SAP. Vista and SS&amp;C though are not in the same league. The latter is already leveraged to three times ebitda. The Blue Prism deal would take it up to four times. &#xa0;</p> <p>A third bidder might save the day. But almost 20 potential buyers have sniffed around the company's business. Limited interest in Blue Prism may point to specific issues an apathetic UK investor base cannot be blamed for.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Blue Prism: US buyers vie for another cheap UK stock' FT.com 1 December.
