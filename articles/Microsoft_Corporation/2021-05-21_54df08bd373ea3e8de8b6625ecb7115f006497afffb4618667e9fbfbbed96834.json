  "title": "Google  To Open  Permanent  NYC Store  ----  By Matt Grossman",
  "text": "<p>   Google will open its first-ever permanent retail store in New York City in coming weeks, a bet that a physical retail presence can help showcase and sell its products as the pandemic eases. </p><p>   The store, to be located in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, is set to open this summer and sell items such as Google's Pixel phones, Nest smart thermostats and Fitbit wearable devices, the company said Thursday. The store also will host workshops on using Google products, and provide repair and troubleshooting services. </p><p>   The store will be part of Google's existing campus in the neighborhood. In 2018, Google bought the 1.2-million-square-foot Chelsea Market building for more than $2 billion, across the street from its even larger office building at 111 Eighth Ave. </p><p>   \"Google has been in New York for the last 20 years, and we view the store as a natural extension of our longtime commitment to the city,\" said Jason Rosenthal, the company's vice president of direct channels and membership. </p><p>   Alphabet Inc.'s Google has temporarily run pop-up stores in New York City and Chicago in the past, but the Chelsea site would be its first permanent location. New York City is Google's second-biggest employee base after its global headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. </p><p>   Other giant tech companies have pursued bricks-and-mortar operations with varying results. Apple Inc. opened its first retail store nearly 20 years ago and brought its retail concept to New York City in 2002, with a store in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood. In the years since, Apple's retail empire has grown to hundreds of stores world-wide. </p><p>   Apple has another large New York City store, across the street from Google's offices in Chelsea. </p><p>   Microsoft Corp., on the other hand, said last year that it would exit its bricks-and-mortar operations more than a decade after opening its first retail location. At the time, an executive said the company's portfolio was shifting more toward online products. </p><p>   Apple's and Microsoft's stores were hit by waves of closures amid the pandemic. Google said it would require masks and social distancing at its Manhattan store. </p><p>   The company's announcement coincides with easing pandemic-related restrictions in New York, as a vaccination campaign has helped tame the pandemic in the U.S. This week, New York eased mask requirements for vaccinated people, a move that accorded with updated federal guidance. </p><p></p>",
