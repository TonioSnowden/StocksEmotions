  "text": "<p>Mr. Zelensky has described Russian forces as \"murderers\" and \"rapists\" as the extent of killings in towns surrounding Kyiv emerges, and vowed to prosecute what he called war crimes as Russia renewed its missile attacks on several cities. Ukrainian officials and independent rights watchdogs say they are uncovering evidence of war crimes perpetrated by occupation forces, including mass graves, setting off an outcry from Western governments and adding to the pressure on the Biden administration and European allies to do more to tighten sanctions on Russia and step up weapons transfers for Ukraine. The alleged war crimes could make it harder for some countries to justify continuing to purchase oil and natural gas from Russia and complicate the peace talks between Kyiv and Moscow.</p><p>An informal network of Poles, Western Europeans and Ukrainians in diaspora has taken in refugee families and has eased the burden on public services, but local officials are wary of a backlash as the war drags on. Donations to aid groups have already fallen considerably since the start of the war. Resettlement experts said it might be easier for the U.S. to approve Ukrainians than Afghans, some of whom have faced long delays in their efforts to reach the U.S.</p><p>-- The U.S.'s new approach to public intelligence sharing during this war foreshadows future uses of intelligence in international crises.</p><p>-- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban won a fifth term Sunday in an election that became a referendum on his promise to block support for Ukraine.</p><p>-- NATO has deployed a new front line in Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia.</p><p>-- In a Pennsylvania town, a Ukrainian church and its Russian neighbor are negotiating the anxiety and outrage of the war.</p><p>The world is piling on debt as it battles inflation</p><p>Surging food and fuel prices are raising pressure on governments to pick up the tab for consumers, stretching precarious public finances and intensifying political instability in the shakiest economies. The handouts can help keep fuel and food price protests in check, but they are boosting already high government debt just as borrowing costs are rising. For emerging markets in particular, the cost for often depleted public coffers is also an issue. Emerging economies must refinance debt totaling about $7 trillion this year, up from $5.5 trillion in 2021.</p><p>-- U.S. shoppers are cutting spending on household staples by buying less, switching brands and hunting for deals.</p><p>Shifts in the yields on two-year and 10-year Treasury notes spark recession concerns</p><p>When short-term interest rates are higher than long-term interest rates, it is sometimes a signal of recession. The phenomenon Wall Street mavens call an inverted yield curve happened on Friday, when the yield on two-year Treasury notes hit 2.44% and on 10-year notes it lagged behind at 2.38%. Fed researchers found that the relationship of rates over shorter horizons of less than two years was a more accurate measure of the risk of recession, a view endorsed by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. Taken all together, the yield-curve signals seem to be saying that the Fed has room and time to raise short-term interest rates from their rock-bottom levels in the months ahead.</p><p>In global trading today, major Asian stock indexes rose, Europe was mixed at midday and U.S. stock futures wavered.</p><p>-- Short sellers are betting against tether, a cryptocurrency whose price shouldn't move.</p><p>-- Tesla CEO Elon Musk disclosed a 9% stake in Twitter, sending shares of the social-media company higher.</p><p>-- Biotech companies are having one of their worst stock-market runs, as rising interest rates, scientific setbacks and a slowdown in big pharma buyouts batter the sector.</p><p>-- Investor David Amaryan is among those sticking with Russia as others race for the exit.</p><p>-- A few mutual-fund managers have emerged from the turmoil of the past 12 months with some eye-popping numbers.</p><p>U.S. companies are relaxing many Covid-19-related requirements as office occupancy nears pandemic-era highs in many cities. Some employers made masks optional in the office for all workers, while others dropped testing requirements for the unvaccinated or simplified return-to-office questionnaires. The new protocols in many cases follow updated guidance from health authorities.</p><p>-- Senators are looking to reappropriate roughly $10 billion to pay for Covid-19 treatments and vaccines, saying they need to act quickly ahead of a possible resurgence.</p><p>-- Outdoor dining expansions saved some restaurants during the pandemic, but making them permanent can be tricky for city officials.</p><p>-- Shanghai began testing all 25 million residents for Covid-19 today, with the entire city now effectively under a lockdown that was meant to be in its final day.</p><p>Suspects are being sought in a mass shooting in downtown Sacramento, Calif., that left six people dead and at least 12 others wounded early Sunday. The shooting occurred around 2 a.m. local time outside a stretch of bars and nightclubs, and all of those killed or wounded were adults. Police Chief Kathy Lester said authorities haven't determined a motive, but are investigating a possible connection to a large fight in the area before the shooting.</p><p>-- Jury selection begins today in the death-penalty trial for the gunman in the 2018 Parkland, Fla., high-school massacre.</p><p>-- Three U.S. Army soldiers were among 12 people charged in an interstate gun-trafficking ring that supplied guns to gang members in Chicago.</p><p>Pay for U.S. CEOs is on pace to set a record</p><p>Median pay rose to $14.2 million last year for the leaders of S&amp;P 500 companies, up from a record $13.4 million for the same companies a year earlier, according to a WSJ analysis. Most CEOs received a pay increase of 11% or more, and pay rose by at least 25% for nearly one-third of them. Pay fell for about a quarter of the CEOs.</p><p>Pay rose last year for rank-and-file employees, too, but more slowly. Half the companies said pay for their median worker increased by 3.1% or less in 2021, and at one-third of companies, median employee pay declined year over year -- broadly similar to pre-pandemic rates of change. March's wage gains suggest employers are feeling less pressure to offer pay increases as more people return to the workforce, which could ease inflation pressures.</p><p>In other business news. . .</p><p>-- Starbucks said it is suspending billions of dollars in share repurchases, a move that returning CEO Howard Schultz said would free up cash to invest in cafes and employees.</p><p>-- The union victory of Amazon workers in a New York City warehouse is the latest example of renewed interest in labor activism among U.S. workers.</p><p>-- Microsoft President Brad Smith has taken an amicable role with regulators.

The deal seeks to grant approvals to add hydroelectric power, a carbon-free energy source, to some existing dams in as little as two years, while speeding the approval of off-river pumped-storage projects, which store surplus energy for later use, in as little as three years. Another key component would give tribes, instead of the federal government, authority on the conditions put on permits for things like the protection of tribal cultural resources or fish passage.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
