But he doesn't think any rally will last.</p><p>\"I don't see how this market rallies unless the Fed pivots to a more dovish stance or valuations get low enough that fundamentals can support the market. I don't think fundamentals can help this market yet. So lower prices are likely to come after any FOMC rebound,\" said Kramer.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B over the weekend reported stronger-than-forecast earnings after buying back $3.2 billion in stock. Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett told shareholders that a \"casino\" market allowed the conglomerate to quickly build up a stake in Occidental Petroleum OXY, as he also revealed that he's back in the merger arbitrage business after buying up nearly 10% of Activision Blizzard ATVI, the videogame maker that's agreed to be purchased by Microsoft.</p><p>U.S. stock futures edge higher after worst month for equities since the last recession</p>",
