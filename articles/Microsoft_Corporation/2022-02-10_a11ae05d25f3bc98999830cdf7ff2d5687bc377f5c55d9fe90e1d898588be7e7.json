  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> Credit Suisse investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/629644e4-2ae5-44da-858c-eaff8b224c8f\">have warned</a> that they will try to block any move to extend the tenure of the bank's longtime vice-chair Severin Schwan, as the scandal-hit bank faces growing pressure to rebuild its reputation against the backdrop of its former chair's departure and a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c52036b-f824-4897-8a78-0ccb69bc40ce\">money-laundering trial</a>.</p> <h2>A disgraced PR maven stages his own comeback</h2> <p>The upside to being forced out of a PR powerhouse amid allegations of sexual harassment? The crisis management advice comes free.</p> <p>Last year <strong>Declan Kelly</strong>, the co-founder and former boss of “CEO advisory firm” <strong>Teneo</strong>, was tasked with damage control over his own reputation after the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77203615-503e-4f6d-8011-1dbf99286140\">revealed</a> that he had touched a number of women without their consent at a charity concert for the non-profit group <strong>Global Citizen</strong>.</p> <p>Less than a year later, his gift for currying favour among the rich and powerful has proved useful. </p> <p>The 54-year-old has been quietly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a509b20-ebc3-4c05-94d5-bf7cef3b9716\">plotting a comeback</a> by launching a new Manhattan-based advisory business called<strong> Consello</strong>, DD's James Fontanella-Khan and Arash Massoudi and the FT's Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson report.</p> <p>The company was formed in July last year, just a fortnight after Kelly left Teneo, according to company registration documents. </p> <p>Consello's bare-bones website <a href=\"https://consellogroup.com/\">reveals little</a> other than the fact that it focuses on investing, merchant banking, corporate development and M&amp;A. Mention of Kelly's involvement is nowhere to be found. </p> <p>DD wonders whether that's intentional.</p> <p>At Teneo, the skilled CEO whisperer and crisis manager was entrusted to handle the reputations of some of the world's most powerful corporate chieftains. Following his departure, the firm was dropped by client <strong>General Motors</strong> and Kelly's name removed from the website of <strong>Integrum</strong>, the investment firm he launched with former <strong>Xerox</strong> boss <strong>Ursula Burns</strong>.</p> <p>Kelly's low-profile return to the advisory world was unexpected to some dealmakers. Two bankers told the FT they were surprised to see him at a client meeting in recent months. </p> <p>The bankers declined to name the companies they were working on behalf of, leaving DD curious as to whether Consello can ever get away with charging the same hefty fees — as high as $1mn per month — that Teneo has charged in the past.</p> <h2>Luckin Coffee's double-shot at US markets</h2> <p>The rapid unravelling of<strong> Luckin Coffee </strong>in the summer of 2020 threatened to rupture Wall Street's highly lucrative love affair with Chinese companies. </p> <p>Less than 12 months after it listed in the US, the Chinese coffee shop chain <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1d758f2-f66d-47f2-b100-fb43d9e8414e\">revealed</a> that it had raised $1.9bn from investors based on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of fake sales. It was subsequently delisted by <strong>Nasdaq</strong> and forced to pay $180mn to the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>.</p> <p>But that hasn't stopped it from brewing up yet another US listing, as the FT's Eleanor Olcott and Tabby Kinder detail in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7bc61e6-bd22-44db-9eaf-86e72f8b822d\">this Big Read</a>.</p> <p>The effects of Luckin's fraud scandal were felt far beyond the battered holdings of its US and Asian investors like <strong>BlackRock </strong>and Singapore's <strong>GIC</strong>, which had been desperate to profit from booming Chinese consumption at any cost. </p> <p>US senators seized on the fiasco, and passed legislation that could ban Chinese companies from listing on US exchanges without handing over their audit papers for inspection.</p> <p>It was the latest in a long list of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf5153c6-52bb-43dd-9efd-817aeaf7bb93\">failures by Big Four auditors</a> to spot holes in company accounts (Luckin was audited by <strong>EY</strong>), and a reminder that tales of rapid growth spun to woo global investors are often too good to be true.</p> <p>Two years later, Luckin hopes to convince investors that it has cleaned up its act.</p> <p>Since its delisting, the coffee chain has embarked on a rapid expansion in China and now has more than 6,000 stores in the country — about 500 more than <strong>Starbucks</strong>. Its latest quarterly revenues have more than doubled to $364.7mn year on year and its growth looks set to attract investor interest yet again.</p> <p>Experts say it will be challenging to win over institutional investors, particularly as Washington looks to delist Chinese companies that refuse to hand over their full financial reports, which Beijing bars them from doing.</p> <p>One senior Luckin executive told the FT that the company was seeking “redemption” with investors and to “demonstrate to the outside world that this is a great company”.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's a lofty goal considering the distrust brewing between Beijing and Washington over the listing of Chinese companies in the US — tension Luckin's fraudulent past helped fuel in the first place.</p> <h2>What happens when private capital becomes less private</h2> <p>DD <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c56a7da-6435-469c-90d8-28e966f20379\">has written before</a> about how private equity firms, once lauded as untouchable “masters of the universe” have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f75f50e7-381f-4c95-9e0f-25e32f70662d\">begun to resemble</a> the massive conglomerates they once sought to dismantle. </p> <p>Thanks to a return squeeze on public markets and private equity's signature “two and twenty” expense model (2 per cent in management fees and a 20 per cent cut of profits), the industry is achieving record scale, and record returns. </p> <p>This windfall has been well-received by return-hungry investors. But Wall Street's most powerful regulator now wants its cut. &#xa0;</p> <p>The <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> is pushing to vastly increase its regulatory oversight of buyout firms by introducing new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddb097f8-41bd-41c9-916e-713ea4035d8d\">fee disclosure requirements</a> for hedge funds and private equity groups in an effort to curb practices “contrary to the public interest”.&#xa0;</p> <p>It comes as the downcast mood in public markets sends pension funds and endowments rushing to invest in alternative assets.</p> <p>SEC commissioner <strong>Gary Gensler</strong> has specifically led the charge for more transparency around private equity and hedge fund fees, which he estimated to be approximately $250bn a year, and in the industry's more arcane deals like so-called co-investments and general partner-led secondary transactions.</p> <p>It's unlikely that the private capital sector, which has amassed a powerful lobbying presence in Washington, will back down without a flight. </p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93d8f393-24e2-4fac-ba03-1f1c6e7e8e09\">as Lex notes</a>, increased transparency could be inevitable if the industry purses the same scale as their retail investment and Wall Street banking peers.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Sam Rosenblum</strong> has joined<strong> KRH Partners</strong>, the crypto venture capital firm founded by former <strong>Andreessen Horowitz </strong>general partner <strong>Katie Haun</strong>, as a partner and deal team lead.</p></li>  <li><p>Payments group <strong>Marqeta </strong>has hired <strong>Mike Milotich </strong>as its chief financial officer. He was previously head of finance and investor relations at <strong>Visa</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Sequoia India </strong>managing director <strong>Amit Jain</strong> is stepping down in order to launch his own start-up.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Dropping the ball </strong>In the years after footage surfaced of running back Ray Rice punching his fiancée unconscious, the National Football League vowed to uplift women and take domestic violence seriously.
