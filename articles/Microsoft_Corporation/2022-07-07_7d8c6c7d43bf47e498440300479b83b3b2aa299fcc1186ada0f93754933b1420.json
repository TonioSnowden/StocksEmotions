  "text": "<p>A Twitter spokesman confirmed the layoffs but declined further comment.</p><p>In light of the hiring pause Twitter is reprioritizing the talent acquisition team, which includes recruiters, to ensure that it operates efficiently and responsibly, the spokesman said.</p><p>The layoffs come as Twitter awaits completion of Mr. Musk's $44 billion deal to buy the company. In May, Mr. Musk said his deal was \"on hold,\" as he questioned the way Twitter calculates spam and fake accounts.</p><p>On Thursday, Twitter officials in a briefing doubled down on defending the accuracy of their calculation of spam on the platform. They reiterated on a call with reporters that spam accounts make up less than 5% of the company's daily monetizable users, which Twitter defines as daily users who are logged in and authenticated.</p><p>Mr. Musk has suggested that he thinks the number could be closer to 20%, without providing evidence that the company's disclosures were unreliable.</p><p>Twitter is the latest tech company to announce layoffs amid falling stock prices and fears of recession. Last month, Coinbase Global Inc. said it would cut 1,100 employees, or 18% of its staff, while Unity Software Inc. last week announced that it would lay off 4% of its work force.</p><p>Others, including Microsoft Corp., Snap Inc. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., have announced reductions in hiring or hiring freezes.</p><p>Numerous Twitter employees took to LinkedIn to post about the layoffs.</p><p>\"I am overwhelmed; nervous and anxious but trying to stay optimistic of the future,\" a recruiter who was laid off from Twitter wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday.</p><p>Write to Salvador Rodriguez at salvador.rodriguez@wsj.com</p><p>Twitter Lays Off Third of Talent Team</p>",
