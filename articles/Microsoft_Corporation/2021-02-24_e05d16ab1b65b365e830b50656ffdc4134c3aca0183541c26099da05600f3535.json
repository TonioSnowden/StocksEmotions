  "text": "<p>Joby Aviation has agreed to merge with a blank cheque company launched by the entrepreneurs Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus, in a deal that values the electric flying taxi developer at $6.6bn after a new fundraising.&#xa0;</p> <p>The aircraft maker confirmed on Wednesday that it would go public via a merger with Reinvent Technology Partners, the special purpose acquisition company created last year by Hoffman, who co-founded LinkedIn, and Pincus, founder of the video games maker Zynga.</p> <p>Plans for the deal were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42feff1d-8228-4c93-bd78-b537d9eb9fa7\">first reported</a> by the Financial Times earlier this month.</p> <p>Joby, whose existing backers include Uber and Toyota, is the latest electric aircraft maker to go public via a Spac. Veteran and first-time investors alike are making speculative bets on which companies might one day transport commuters above the skyscrapers of urban centres such as from New York to Shanghai.&#xa0;</p> <p>Archer, a rival of Joby, merged earlier this month with a Spac backed by US investment banker Ken Moelis, giving it a public <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2e63918-fca1-4ca6-b5bf-5e72a67133a6\">valuation of $3.8bn</a>. Blade, which currently operates helicopters, has also listed via a Spac as it plans to expand into the business of electric air taxi services.&#xa0;</p> <p>In Europe, German electric aviation start-up Lilium, which is backed by UK private investment manager Baillie Gifford, is also looking to go public by merging with a Spac.&#xa0;Baillie Gifford is also an investor in Joby.</p> <p>The deal with Reinvent provides Joby with $1.6bn in cash to pursue its development work, $690m from the pot raised last year by the Hoffman-Pincus Spac plus $910m in new money from investors that include the hedge fund Baupost and funds managed by BlackRock and Fidelity.</p> <p>Joby was founded in 2009 and has more than 500 employees. The Santa Cruz-based company has obtained approval from the US Air Force to fly its so-called electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, it says, and has tested its aircraft for more than 1,000 hours.&#xa0;</p> <p>It plans to start manufacturing aircraft later this year on a 450,000-square-foot facility it designed with Toyota. The Japanese carmaker last year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bfaabfe0-37ea-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4\">led a $620m investment</a> round in Joby, which led to closer co-operation between engineers of both companies.</p> <p>Joby in December bought Uber Elevate, the flying taxi arm of the ride-sharing group; Eric Allison, the former head of Uber Elevate, is now Joby's head of product.</p> <p>Joby, Archer and Lilium all say they hope to begin deployment of their flying taxis between 2023 and 2025.</p> <p>The US “air mobility market” could be worth as much as $115bn in annual revenue by 2035, creating 280,000 jobs along the way, according to a report by Deloitte, the consultancy, and the Aerospace Industries Association.<br></p><p>Source: James Fontanella-Khan in New York and Patrick McGee in San Francisco 2021 'Flying taxi start-up Joby to go public in deal with LinkedIn and Zynga founders' FT.com 24 February.
