  "text": "<p>Staffers point to rising living costs, improved labor productivity and the tech company's strong revenues as reasons for wanting an increase of 15.7% in the base wage, according to the internal communications that worker negotiators sent recently to fellow employees. They are also seeking boosts to other employee benefits, such as expanded family healthcare coverage, the message reads.</p><p>The latest requests come as Samsung contends with a new group of tech challengers wooing workers in its home country of South Korea, changing expectations from younger employees and separate salary negotiations with the company's first-ever labor unions, according to employees and Samsung watchers.</p><p>Samsung declined to comment on the forces driving the workers' salary requests or rising competition. But it confirmed that talks are continuing with the unions and with the Work Council, where representatives of Samsung's South Korean employees and management meet annually to decide on compensation and other benefits. The company \"is making every sincere effort to come to an agreement,\" Samsung said.</p><p>Riding a strong year for semiconductors and resilience in smartphone demand, Samsung posted its best-ever annual sales of roughly $233 billion in 2021, an 18% increase from the prior year. Net profit for the year also rose more than 50%.</p><p>Samsung, which has made retaining younger employees a priority, has made efforts to share gains from the strong performance with its workforce. Late last year, the company cited special worker bonuses as a reason for issuing lower-than-expected operating-profit guidance.</p><p>Samsung has long operated without a worker's union. Over the years, a handful of employee representatives from Samsung's major business divisions held annual Work Council talks with management about wages and workers' demands.</p><p>Last year, the workers asked for a base-pay increase of 6.36% before the two sides agreed to a 4.5% base-pay increase plus other incentives tied to employees' individual performance.</p><p>Workers around the world are seeking more compensation and other benefits amid growing inflation, labor shortages and rising competition. This is particularly true in the tech sector, which has recorded robust profits throughout the pandemic. Some tech companies are even now turning to cash, rather than stock options, as a way to entice and keep talent.</p><p>For decades, Samsung had its pick of South Korea's brightest college graduates and kept them around, having awarded generous pay, perks and benefits relative to the local competition, former executives and company watchers say. More recently, other internet firms and startups in the country have had success capturing workers by touting more relaxed work environments, competitive salaries and perks such as stock options, they say.</p><p>\"Work-and-life balance is more important. Younger workers care more about the money rather than pride,\" said Chang Sea-jin, who has written books about Samsung's rise and is a business professor at the National University of Singapore.</p><p>The relatively new group of Samsung challengers in the broader tech sector includes e-commerce player Coupang Inc., which went public last year in the U.S. in one of the year's biggest listings, and local mobile giant Kakao Corp., whose founder recently took the title of South Korea's wealthiest individual -- becoming the first non-Samsung leader to hold that distinction in more than a decade.</p><p>Last year, South Korea's internet and tech companies greenlighted big wage increases to attract talent as business boomed during the pandemic, putting pressure on others to match, said Nam Sung-woon, a former Samsung human-resources manager who is CEO of Cucurbita Inc., a Seoul-based firm that consults job seekers.</p><p>\"Samsung Electronics employees are saying, I work for a top-tier, global company. But why should I be getting paid less than these smaller firms?\" Mr. Nam said.</p><p>Samsung Electronics' average annual compensation per person stood at 127 million won, roughly equivalent to $106,000, in 2020, according to its annual report. But its once-sizable pay gap with other South Korean tech peers has narrowed in recent years, according to independent salary estimates based on public disclosures.</p><p>South Koreans are also exchanging information about compensation and work conditions across different companies and industries like never before, according to a recent report by the government-funded Korea Labor Institute. They are using apps like Blind, which is a cross of sorts between LinkedIn and Glassdoor, where employees can comment anonymously after providing their company email.</p>",
