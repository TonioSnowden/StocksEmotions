  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Gear & Gadgets -- 20 Odd Questions:  Idris Elba  ---  The actor on filling dance floors, surviving  road trips and the legacy of 'The Wire'  ----  By Chris Kornelis",
  "text": "<p>\n  In his new film, \"Beast,\" Idris Elba plays a father who brings his teenage daughters to the South African village where their late mother was raised. The movie quickly becomes a thriller with the entrance of a vengeful, hungry lion. If the idea of a blockbuster that foregrounds the terror brought about by a hostile apex predator feels familiar, that's intentional. Mr. Elba says the team behind \"Beast\" took \"the temperature of why 'Jaws' works\" into account while making their film. \"We wanted to make something that resonates and [becomes] a classic.\" </p><p>\n  The result has the heart of a family road-trip film. While sheltering from the lion in a car, the three process their loss. Mr. Elba, 49, is no stranger to the family road trip -- as terrifying for some fathers as sharks. But the English actor says none he's taken with his two children have inspired him to pick up a tranquilizer gun. \"I don't mind a road trip, man. I like driving.\" </p><p>\n  Here, the actor, DJ and perennial favorite of the future-James-Bond rumor mill dishes on his favorite videogame and go-to tracks for filling the dance floor. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  My longest road trip was: between Detroit and Atlanta years ago. I was by myself and it went really well. I did it in one sitting. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I always pack an: Akai MIDI keyboard so I can make music when I'm on the road. I've released many songs that I made in trailers on the sets of movies. I don't play instruments very well, but if I've got my MIDI keyboard, I can futz my way around. I made a house tune called \"Body Shots\" in South Africa when we were shooting \"Beast.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I spend a lot of time playing: \"FIFA 21\" football on my Xbox between shots, when I'm not making music. I play with my team: my barber, my makeup guy, security. It's addictive and I have a lot of fun. I'm an Arsenal fan, so sometimes I play with Arsenal. Other times I play with Paris Saint-Germain, which is a really good team. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  My favorite accessory is: My Samsung Galaxy Watch. I can make calls on it without using my phone, and I use it to listen to curated stuff on Spotify and Tidal. The more varied -- the more I don't know what [the song] is going to be -- the better. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Lately I've been listening to: quite a bit of old-school Congolese music. I love the instrumentation and the sounds recorded on old analog gear. You can hear the hum of the guitar and all that. I also love this singer from the U.K. called Cleo Sol. She's incredible. Her music's really inspiring. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  When I DJ-ed weddings, I could always fill the floor with: \"Hot Hot Hot,\" by the Calypso artist Arrow. It's wicked. It has this sort of, \"Oh, man, I'm gonna dance to this\" energy. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I taught myself to: drive. I got a job at a tire fixer's; I was 14, but I told them I was 16. They said, \"When cars come in, sometimes you have to move them.\" So, I jumped in the car, put it in first gear and taught myself. And these cars were manuals. If you took the clutch up too quick, it stalled. You didn't want to do that in front of the boss, 'cause then he'd be, like: Well, can you drive? I learned to drive quick. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  My first car was: a red Mini Cooper. It was really old, had pleather green seats and you could smell the engine. I loved it. It was a manual, too. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  These days, learning to drive a manual is: about as useful as learning to write left-handed. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Today, I drive: a Mercedes-Benz EQC, which is a little electric car. It's so smooth. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  During lockdown, I found a love for: gymnastics. I was looking for ways to stay fit, went down a YouTube rabbit hole and stumbled across a whole bunch of classic gymnastic routines. I became obsessed by it and just fascinated by how tough and agile the human body is. I was like, \"When I get out of here, I'm going to become a gymnast.\" I haven't done it yet. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I don't get a chance to: read full books. I might read a couple of chapters for research. But because I have to read so many scripts and stories and treatments, the time for books isn't there. Which is a shame. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I still live with: Stringer Bell. I'm asked about my character from \"The Wire\" a lot, so I talk about him quite a bit. He's such a polarizing character. He was loved, for sure, and admired. But at the same time, he was not a good guy. He wasn't, like, this savior. He's a drug dealer. But an incredible character to play. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The first film I saw in the cinema was: \"Spider-Man: The Dragon's Challenge\" (1981). I was probably about 9 years old. It was a Saturday matinee. My mom gave us some money for food and popcorn and whatnot. I was just fascinated. I'll never forget that moment when I was like, I wanna do that. I wanna be a part of the team that pulls these incredible movies together. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I recently re-watched: \"The Bourne Identity\" (2002). It's a brilliant film. You have to go through a lot of effort to make action movies feel real to the audience while making sure everyone making it feels safe. There are a lot of combined layers to it. And in that \"Bourne\" film, they did a really fantastic job of making it feel like you were there. I was really struck by that. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  My favorite James Bond is: Sean Connery. I think he is incredible and really cool. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I don't have an opinion on: who plays James Bond next. I think that it could be really well cast, and I look forward to whoever gets it. When I look in the mirror, I don't see James Bond. I see John Luther, a character I played for 10 years on BBC One. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  An app that I love is: \"Demo,\" a songwriting app that has curated musical phrases, guitar loops and such that make it easier to construct song ideas. I use it to get ideas out. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  I'm about to listen to the podcast: \"Dissect,\" which breaks down how songs are built. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  My dad used to tell me: whenever you're talking to someone, as much as you can, as difficult as it might be for a young man, look them in the eye. Looking people in the eye is the best way to communicate empathy, to avoid conflict, to dispel conflict, to fall in love -- it's all through the eyes. </p><p>\n  -- Edited from an interview by Chris Kornelis </p><p></p>",
