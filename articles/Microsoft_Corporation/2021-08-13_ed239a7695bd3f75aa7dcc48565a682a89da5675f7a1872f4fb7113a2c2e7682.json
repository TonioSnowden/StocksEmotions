Spears, calling the conservatorship \"abusive.\"</p><p>A new lawyer for Ms. Spears, Mathew Rosengart, has moved aggressively in recent weeks to remove or suspend Mr. Spears. It is part of a broader effort to terminate the conservatorship over Ms. Spears, an obscure legal arrangement that has been in place since 2008 when it was instituted for her protection due to mental-health issues and potential substance abuse. Ms. Spears has acknowledged its necessity at the time.</p><p>Mr. Spears maintained there were \"no actual grounds for suspending or removing\" him, but said he \"does not believe a public battle with his daughter over his continuing service as her conservator would be in her best interests.\"</p><p>Mr. Rosengart, the lawyer for Ms. Spears, praised the move in a written statement. \"It is vindication for Britney,\" he wrote.</p><p>-- Neil Shah</p><p>---</p><p>CALIFORNIA</p><p>Cannabis Is Illegal for</p><p>Inmates, Court Says</p><p>Prison inmates can't legally possess marijuana under California's law allowing recreational pot, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday in overturning a lower court that found prisoners could have the drug as long as they didn't consume it.</p><p>The justices said the 2019 appellate court ruling allowing prisoners to have up to 1 ounce of marijuana went against common sense. The Supreme Court sided with the state attorney general in finding the state's marijuana law approved by voters didn't apply to Californians in prison.</p><p>\"It seems implausible\" that the voters intended to essentially decriminalize marijuana in prisons, Associate Justice Joshua Groban wrote for the majority.</p><p>California in 1996 became the first state to legalize medical marijuana, and 20 years later voters approved Proposition 64 establishing the world's largest legal recreational pot marketplace. People 21 or older can legally possess up to an ounce of marijuana.</p><p>-- Associated Press</p><p>---</p><p>WASHINGTON</p><p>Gates Makes Pledge</p><p>For Climate Projects</p><p>Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates said his climate investment fund will commit $1.5 billion for joint projects with the U.S. government if Congress enacts a program aimed at developing technologies that lower carbon emissions.</p><p>A roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill passed by the Senate this week would give the Energy Department $25 billion for demonstration projects funded through public-private partnerships, part of more than $100 billion to address climate change. The House hasn't yet approved the legislation.</p><p>Mr. Gates, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, said a fund run by his Breakthrough Energy could spend the money over three years on projects aimed at slowing the greenhouse-gas emissions that cause climate change. The Breakthrough projects would have to compete with other applicants for the funds.</p><p>-- Timothy Puko</p>",
