  "text": "<p>While the new variant might evade the antibodies generated in reaction to the vaccine, the virus will likely remain vulnerable to immune cells that destroy IT once it enters the body, BioNTech SE BNTX co-founder Ugur Sahin said.</p><p>“Our message is: Don't freak out, the plan remains the same: Speed up the administration of a third booster shot,” Dr. Sahin said in an interview Tuesday.</p><p>Based on current knowledge about the mechanisms behind the vaccine and the biology of variants, Dr. Sahin said he assumed that immunized people would have a high level of protection against severe disease even if infected by the omicron variant. Dr. Sahin said that the vaccine, which he and his team invented in January 2020 and then developed together with Pfizer Inc. PFE, has been proven to protect from severe disease against other variants of the coronavirus that do infect vaccinated people.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Microsoft's Nadella sells half of his stake in company.</p><p>Workers quit jobs in droves to become their own bosses.</p>",
