  "title": "Stephen Colbert on Faith and his 'Late Show' of Love; How America's No. 1 late-night host keeps things upbeat and soulful: \"I think America is essentially an optimistic country.\"",
  "text": "<p>Colbert told his audience that he was staying put. \"If the audience can't show up, I'm still going to be here,\" he said. \"If the cameramen quit, I'm still going to be here. I'm not leaving the Ed Sullivan. I will do the show with no makeup in a sweatsuit on a GoPro, but I'm never f—ing going back into that room on the eighth floor again.\" The audience broke into laughter. \"I'm sorry!\" he said. \"I'm sorry for the spicy talk, but…line! Line in the sand!\"</p><p>He played this rant for laughs, but it represented \"a hundred percent honest frustration,\" Colbert told me later. He was sitting in his office in Midtown Manhattan—his actual office—with Benny, his brown-haired Boykin spaniel, lurking in the bottom of the frame; our planned in-person meeting had been changed to Zoom out of the proverbial abundance of caution. His production team, which numbers nearly 200 people, was reduced to a skeleton crew on-site, with the remainder working from home.</p><p>\"This place is beginning to feel like Pripyat, the town next to Chernobyl, again,\" he said.</p><p>At the time we spoke, Omicron was already easing its grip on New York City, and Colbert was looking forward to welcoming in-person guests beyond the CBS ringers he had conscripted during the leanest days of early 2022, such as the TV reporter John Dickerson and the morning anchor Gayle King. But Colbert sensed a \"banked-down energy\" in the people in the seats at the Ed Sullivan, who must show proof of vaccination to enter. \"There's a cautiousness,\" he said. \"There's a little bit of a sound blanket—a little cotton blanket on people.\"</p><p>Colbert can empathize, even as he soldiers on. \"I'm just tired,\" he said. \"I think America is essentially an optimistic country. That's the nature. 'A more perfect Union' is an optimistic thing to say. We're all just tired.\" To some degree, he suspects that the relative quiet in the theater was a matter of pragmatic consideration: a reluctance to laugh because the 450-strong studio audience \"might be a little bit afraid to literally spread aerosolized droplets.\" But another likely cause was pure beaten-down exhaustion. The past two years have been trauma stacked upon trauma for the American people. And here, in the form of Omicron, was yet another incursion upon their well-being.</p><p>The final episode of Colbert's previous TV show, The Colbert Report, aired December 18, 2014 on Comedy Central. Earlier that year, CBS announced that Colbert had been hired to succeed David Letterman as the host of its marquee late-night program. It was a somewhat risky choice—to that point, the viewing public had known Colbert only as the man he calls \"the character,\" the low-information, right-wing blowhard whose parodic show was largely modeled upon Bill O'Reilly's The O'Reilly Factor.</p><p>The farewell episode of The Colbert Report ended with a rousing all-star rendition of \"We'll Meet Again,\" the chipper song popularized by the English singer Vera Lynn during World War II. It's quite something to watch this performance today: Colbert and his TV benefactor, Jon Stewart, start singing to the piano accompaniment of Randy Newman. Then the camera pans to reveal dozens of high-achieving people from the ranks of American politics, arts and sciences, among them Willie Nelson, Gloria Steinem, George Lucas, Katie Couric, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Ken Burns, Cory Booker, former NIH director Francis Collins, Samantha Power and Henry Kissinger—an eclectic group that Colbert described to me as \"friends of the show.\"</p><p>Among those present that night, gamely singing along, was Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas. In 31 months, his youngest child, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, would become the press secretary for the next president. But in the moment, the finale number was a pageant of establishment camaraderie and normalcy. No one had any idea.</p><p>Recalling his mindset in the halcyon period in which he was preparing his CBS show, Colbert said, \"I actually thought I could come here and be sillier. I thought I could lay down my sword and shield down by the riverside, because that's the part of the old gig I didn't particularly like—anybody thinking, 'Hey, what you do is important!' Because that is antithetical to being as silly as you possibly can, and I really love being dumb.\"</p><p>Colbert noted a willfully dumb joke that he delivered on The Late Show just a few nights before our talk, based on a news report that, on a farm somewhere, cows had been fitted with VR goggles so that they could look at pastoral scenes rather than their grim surroundings. \"The only way to get them to produce milk is to put them in the Mootrix,\" Colbert cracked.</p><p>\"It didn't get a huge laugh from the audience,\" Colbert told me, \"but that's the only kind of joke I want to do every night.\"</p><p>The times in which we live, however, do not brook an abundance of Mootrix jokes. When The Late Show With Stephen Colbert made its debut in September 2015, the political landscape was undergoing a tectonic shift. Jeb Bush, booked as one of Colbert's first guests because he was the presumed front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, was polling disastrously, while the news was increasingly dominated by footage of Donald Trump addressing crowds in MAGA wear at his rallies. An hour-long program of silliness, Colbert said, \"did not match the moment we became part of.\"</p><p>Colbert took a while to find his footing and his non-\"character\" voice as a host. But the onset of the Trump presidency focused his vision. Colbert has never gone full-on firebrand, but his righteousness is evident every night in his opening monologue. In his first show of the Trump administration, at the end of January 2017, Colbert observed that it was already too late to \"wait and see\" how the new president was acquitting himself in office. \"The line moves really fast on this ride,\" he said. \"Every day, you just get right back on the roller coaster and start throwing up.\"</p><p>Ever since, the monologue has provided a moment of catharsis for Colbert and his audience. After the violent Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, he countered Trump's equivocal condemnation of violence \"on many sides\" by saying, \"Here's one thing that's not difficult to express: Nazis are bad. The KKK? I'm not a fan. That wasn't hard. That was easy. I enjoyed saying it!\" And this year, when the leader of the far-right antigovernment militia the Oath Keepers was charged with seditious conspiracy for his actions during the January 6 insurrection, Colbert remarked, \"This is starting to restore my faith in the Justice Department. Finally they're charging people with the sedition we saw with our own eyes on live TV. And hopefully, one day the Feds will learn the identity of that shadowy figure who was the president that told them to do it.\"</p><p>Colbert's undisguised stance regarding the former president (whose name he takes pains to not utter on-air, instead using such euphemisms as \"that ding-a-ling\" and \"Dubious Caesar\") was a controversial choice—digging in against Trump right after the man had received nearly 63 million votes. And it wasn't without consequence: Indignant Trump supporters launched a #FireColbert campaign on social media. But 2017 proved to be the making of Colbert's version of The Late Show. That year, he overtook Jimmy Fallon, whose Tonight Show is a more cheery, variety-minded program, as the ratings leader in the 11:30 p.m. slot, and he has held the No. 1 spot for the better part of the past five years.</p><p>The surprising thing about this development is that Colbert's coming of age as a late-night host is less attributable to his knack for political comedy than it is for his gifts as an interviewer and listener. His guest segments, at their best, play out as a sort of lay ministry, with comedy optional—an adult version of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, in which Colbert, like Fred Rogers a slender, clean-cut family man, helps his visitors process their feelings. The viral moments of recent-vintage Late Show are not sick burns at the expense of the Former Guy but heartfelt expressions of emotional honesty.</p><p>In November, for instance, when Andrew Garfield, of the Spider-Man films, came on the program, Colbert took a moment midway through the interview to offer condolences to his family (Garfield had recently lost his mother) and asked the actor to explain \"how art itself helps you deal with grief.\" Garfield, visibly moved by the question, gathered himself before describing his grief as \"only a beautiful thing.… I hope this grief stays with me, because it's all the unexpressed love I didn't get to tell her…. I'm indebted to everyone who has brought me to this place so that I can use [my art] as a way to heal, use it as a way to sew up the wounds. Because that's what we do, right? That's what we do.\" He gestured toward Colbert. \"That's what you do every night,\" he said, \"you sew up our wounds. You sew up our wounds.\"</p><p>A clip of this sequence posted to Twitter has been viewed more than 10 million times. The poster, a young English writer named Lucy Ford, commented, \"This is one of the most gorgeous outlooks on grief I have ever heard.\"</p><p>More recently, Colbert hosted Elvis Costello, one of his favorite musicians, with whom he has a friendly history. Costello too was mourning the recent loss of his mother. As their conversation progressed, Colbert told Costello that he is in the singer's debt. Before his own mother, Lorna, died at the age of 92, Colbert, on his old program, had performed a duet with Costello of the Everly Brothers' \"All I Have to Do Is Dream.\" As his mother lay in extremis, Colbert told his guest, he and his siblings found themselves \"basically kind of, like, loving her: brushing her hair, giving her ice chips, trying to make her comfortable.\" With the close two-part Everlys harmony still fresh in his mind, he and one of his sisters, Margo, decided to perform the song for their mother.</p><p>\"And she was dazzled,\" Colbert told Costello. \"She was like, 'Is this already heaven?' I owe that to you, that moment of joy my mother had.\"</p><p>We don't usually hear about end-of-life ice chips on light television. Over the past couple of decades, audiences have been conditioned to a specific guest-appearance rhythm on a late-night talk show: a series of storytelling builds that culminate in detonations of laughter. Build, detonation; build, detonation; thank you for coming, the film is out this Friday.</p><p>Colbert's exchanges with Garfield and Costello—and also with the singer Dua Lipa, who in February quizzed the host on how his faith and his comedy overlap, prompting from him an earnest disquisition about how sadness is \"not a defeat if you can find a way to laugh about it\"—throw this rhythm off. They are pebbly and awkward, and all the more rewarding for it. The studio audiences seem to pick up on the vibe; they respond not with the unison \"Awww\" of a baldly manipulated daytime-show crowd, but with low murmurs of assent and soft laughter.</p><p>\"The openness and ownership that he has with seemingly culturally taboo subjects, such as grief, allows his guests permission to be in contact and reveal those aspects of their own selves and experiences,\" Garfield wrote in an email after I asked why he spoke so unguardedly on The Late Show. \"In turn,\" he continued, \"the audience gets to have a genuine, deep, and connected experience. So the show feels like an act of service to people. I think Stephen would have made a great priest.\"</p><p>Even when he was playing \"the character\" (as an early guest on The Colbert Report, promoting a book about food, I was taken aback when he said, \"Lemme ask you something: Are baby carrots trying to make me gay?\"), Colbert was widely known to be as kind and decent off the stage as he was abrasive on it. He is involved with such charities as DonorsChoose, which allows individuals to pledge money for educational supplies at specific schools, and IAVA, which offers services to U.S. veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. He has been happily married to his wife, Evie McGee Colbert, since 1993; one of the salves to Late Show viewers' chapped souls during peak lockdown was that, of necessity, Evie became an on-camera regular, performing comic bits with her husband, the two of them offering a portrait of giddy love enduring into middle age.</p><p>Colbert is also a man of God, an observant Catholic whose faith was tested by the loss of his father and two brothers in a plane crash in 1974, when he was 10 years old. For a time, Colbert taught Sunday school in his adopted hometown of Montclair, New Jersey.</p><p>Colbert's father, James William Colbert Jr., was a Jesuit-educated physician who spent his premed years studying philosophy at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. Dr. Colbert's Christian-humanist bent lives on through Stephen, who is fond of quoting the French Catholic philosophers whose books his dad left behind. Describing his commitment to maintaining his optimism and his humanity, Colbert paraphrased the 19th-century essayist Léon Bloy: \"The only sadness is not to bea saint.\"</p><p>As he was hatching his CBS program, Colbert said, he consciously conceived it to be a show about love. \"Of course, you can't say that out loud, because it sounds a little pretentious,\" he said. Then he quoted the poet E.E. Cummings, whose father was also killed in a crash: \"Love is the every only god / who spoke this earth so glad and big.\"</p><p>\"So, why would you talk about anything else?\" Colbert said.</p><p>In practical terms, this meant that, no matter who the guest was or what Colbert was telling a joke about, he tried to keep the idea of love in his mind, and how it related to the conversation he was having with his audience.</p><p>\"When he was taking over for Letterman, he told me the kind of show he wanted to do was a show about people and about love and about being a friend to the regular people out there,\" Jon Batiste, the Late Show's bandleader, told me. \"Having shiny folks come on and genius intellectuals and politicians and celebrities, but also, at the core of that, being a show about people and community. I would argue that it's taken a different form, but we're doing that show.\"</p><p>Colbert and Batiste are uncommonly tight. The two men first met in 2014, when the Louisiana-born musician and his band, Stay Human, were guests on The Colbert Report. Colbert was excited by the instant rapport he established with the younger man, who was only 27 at the time. (\"The character\" didn't understand jazz; Batiste gave as good as he got, saying, \"Improvisation is forever. Everybody's always improvising…. You like reading scripts.\") So in the interregnum between his two programs, Colbert sought out Batiste to be his stage partner at CBS.</p><p>Batiste, to Colbert's surprise, insisted that Colbert meet his parents first, as if the latter had asked the former for his hand in marriage. Colbert didn't blink—he flew down to New Orleans and made his way to Batiste's hometown of Kenner.</p><p>\"He came, sat at our table, and we gave him my mother's famous recipe for red beans and rice New Orleans–style,\" Batiste told me. \"It was a real sharing of my culture, my heritage and my people that would mean something to me. That connection maintained itself as a real thread to our relationship developing and evolving: getting closer and closer because it started out in this place where the frequency was so authentic.\"</p><p>This frequency has proven useful not only for the show's purposes but also for the two men's mental health. Batiste, Colbert said, \"is this unquenchable source of positivity and love.\" Colbert, Batiste said, is \"a light bearer in a dark time\" but nevertheless a vulnerable human being who sometimes needs his own light bearer. \"I know that it's hard for him, so we have a lot of private moments where it just naturally goes to that place\" of lending emotional support, Batiste said. \"Because my role on the show is to really bring that sense of vibrance and uplift.\"</p><p>Together, Colbert and Batiste had an epiphany a couple of years into the Trump administration. \"We often realize we love something as we're losing it,\" Colbert said. So the show about love became, also, a show about loss. \"Many things were lost in the last five years: standards, morals, a shared reality, a shared civic engagement, a lot of friends. And Covid, of course, gave it all a special, piquant little zazz,\" Colbert said.</p><p>In the workplace, this sense of loss took its toll. \"It was such a breakneck pace,\" Colbert said. \"It was such a flaming toboggan ride down the hill every day, especially since everything would change. We would rewrite the whole show at 5 o'clock many a night and go on at 5:30.\" But the chaos also clarified the show's mission, Colbert noted: \"There's a lot of gaslighting going on, and someone wants to convince you that you're crazy. Well, I'm here to say every night that you're not crazy. It's crazy to say you're crazy.\"</p><p>\"The hard part of it is, he's trying to make people laugh. It's a comedy show, but he's always been an emotional person,\" Evie McGee Colbert told me, Zooming in from her and Stephen's native South Carolina, where she was looking after her 92-year-old father as he recovered from a bout with Covid-19. \"The last two years, we've all been on the verge of tears, frankly, a lot,\" she said. \"I kind of feel sometimes that Stephen has become a grief counselor for people in real time on television. He didn't seek that task out, and it's hard. But that, I think, is his act of love.\"</p><p>Stephen Colbert on Faith and his 'Late Show' of Love</p>",
