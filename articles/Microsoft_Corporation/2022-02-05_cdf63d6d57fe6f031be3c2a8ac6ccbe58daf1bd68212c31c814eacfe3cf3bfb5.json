  "text": "<p>When Venky Mysore wants to impress visitors from the US and elsewhere, he invites them to Kolkata's famous Eden Gardens stadium to experience what he considers cricket's future: an Indian Premier League match featuring his team, the Kolkata Knight Riders.</p> <p>“They look at it and say, ‘Wow, what have you done with this?'” says Mysore, the team's chief executive. “70,000 people, night cricket under lights, fireworks, cheerleaders — that's kind of how the brand has grown and what it has done.”</p> <p>Since it started in 2008, the IPL has remade cricket in India — and beyond. Its fast-paced, three-hour matches have brought fans pouring into stadiums to watch a sport otherwise grappling with declining audiences. </p> <p>The world's top players come to India to compete in a league that pays more than any other competition. It has changed the business of cricket, bringing unprecedented funds into the sport from advertisers, sponsors and investors.</p> <p>“It has revived the fortunes of cricket in general,” adds Mysore. “It's a product that needs to be marketed. That's where the traditional form of cricket has missed the bus so far.”</p> <p>The two-month IPL season is watched by hundreds of millions of people around the world, giving the tournament a value of more than $6bn in 2020, according to consultancy Duff and Phelps. It is a mainstay of India's commercial calendar and helps power sales of everything from cars to cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>Now, the league is set to expand. Private equity firm CVC Capital Partners and Indian tycoon Sanjiv Goenka have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d251ebc2-4b24-407c-975d-719e6ad89218\">acquired two new team franchises</a>, taking the total number of IPL teams to 10.</p> <p>They spent previously unthinkable sums, of $745mn and $945mn respectively, on these new franchises. This pushed IPL team valuations above those of many clubs in football's English Premier League, the richest contest in that sport.</p> <p>Goenka and CVC's acquisitions set the stage for even higher outlays.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4546682-8bec-4c52-87f0-4c793073ed49\">Media rights for the IPL</a> expire at the end of the 2022 season. In 2017, broadcaster Star India — then owned by Rupert Murdoch but since taken over by Disney — bought <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99438da6-9156-11e7-a9e6-11d2f0ebb7f0\">the five-year rights</a> for $2.6bn, but the figure is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09dd1125-3305-48aa-b767-2dd1758bc3c6\">expected to rise for the next round</a>.</p> <p>Santosh N, managing partner at Mumbai-based consultancy D and P Advisory, expects broadcast rights to increase from about Rs600mn ($8mn) on a per match basis to as much as Rs1bn.</p> <p>Streaming groups such as Amazon have indicated an interest in bidding this time. Sony and Zee Entertainment, which have agreed a merger deal, told the Financial Times last year they also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f790afc1-f07b-41f2-92fe-2c130f77b09b\">planned to bid for the upcoming rights</a>. Billionaire <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/695cd152-1bf8-40ad-bbef-58d3cac26fd4\">Mukesh Ambani</a>'s Reliance Industries is widely believed to be a contender as well.</p> <p>Santosh expects the competing bids to push the league's valuation well beyond the current $6bn figure.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, the IPL blueprint has been replicated globally. Leagues based on the same format of 20 six-ball overs per team — or Twenty20 — have been set up from the Caribbean to Australia. </p> <p>Mysore, along with others including Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella and Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma, has invested in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce745a64-dd15-45aa-a22d-c096dfcf16a5\">a US league</a> that plans to launch next year.</p> <p>While the IPL has expanded cricket's commercial opportunities, the question of how it has changed the sport itself remains emotive.</p> <p>Notably, the 20-over game has altered how teams play. Batters need to hone an aggressive style to score runs in a short space of time. That contrasts starkly with five-day Test matches, where defensive skills to withstand varied bowling attacks are crucial.</p> <p>It is also unclear how widely the financial benefits have been distributed. Sharda Ugra, a cricket writer, says that, while the quality of grounds in India has improved, players outside the IPL do not seem to be better paid than before.</p> <p>The IPL's reputation has been damaged by allegations of match-fixing. Ugra argues that its riches have done little to professionalise its governing body, the Board of Control for Cricket in India, which has faced scandals in the past. </p> <p>The BCCI has “not transformed from kitchen table governance into professionalism”, Ugra says. “It has transformed from kitchen table governance into an oligarchy.”</p> <p>One of the most hotly debated questions for cricket fans is whether an expanded IPL should begin superseding international matches, traditionally the sport's primary format.</p> <p>Executives and analysts argue that the two-month league needs a longer window to keep growing. Given the packed global cricket calendar, this would mean fewer international fixtures, such as bilateral T20 series.</p> <p>“The league has to become bigger,” Santosh insists. “It can't just be a two-month affair. It has to be a four- or six-month affair.”</p><p>Source: Benjamin Parkin in New Delhi 2022 'Expanded IPL tightens its grip on world game' FT.com 5 February.
