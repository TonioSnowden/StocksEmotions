  "text": "<p>It worked. In addition to his homage to disco, Mr. Beech also made a straightforward, professional accounting of his skills in a separate video shared to his LinkedIn profile. Within weeks, he was hired as a marketing creative for Crowdfunder UK, the digital fundraising platform. The company credits the videos with catching its attention.</p><p>Video resumes have proliferated this year, as TikTok and LinkedIn launched special visual platforms to connect job candidates with hundreds of companies and recruiters. The style of such videos range from lighthearted and unconventional to straightforward elevator pitches. Some, like Mr. Beech's, are elaborately scripted performances, while others look and sound like a written resume read aloud, selfie-style, to a cellphone camera -- recounting alma mater, job experience and ideal role.</p><p>\"They all saw it and they knew exactly who I was,\" Mr. Beech said of the reaction to his video resumes. \"I have tattoos, I have a very out-there look and I have a bold personality that I want to bring to the office with me, and I don't want to join a job where those traits of mine aren't accepted.\"</p><p>Simon Deverell, founder and creative director of Crowdfunder UK, hired Mr. Beech and said he wants his employees to have an attitude and opinions. Mr. Beech's video \"was more viral than anything we've done,\" he said. \"He didn't apply for the job. I approached him because I saw what he'd done.\"</p><p>Career coaches say more employers were starting to ask for video resumes or cover letters as a part of the hiring process, particularly in creative industries, when the pandemic made most of the hiring world pivot to video interviews. That trend sped up the appetite for full-blown video resumes.</p><p>\"I've got to do as much as possible to widen my network, so all these agencies that I want to work for know that I'm open to working with new technologies, that I'm comfortable with video,\" said Martin Compton, a freelance events producer who created a video for LinkedIn Cover Story, which is displayed on his profile.</p><p>The TikTok Resumes pilot program, which launched in early July, encouraged job seekers to create short-form video resumes for open positions at 40 partner companies, including Shopify, Sweetgreen, Alo Yoga and Nascar.</p><p>For some brands, soliciting video resumes on social media is a way to meet more young, diverse job candidates. A quippy, personality-driven video is a good alternative for some early-career job seekers who have had less time to build out a traditional resume, said Adrienne Gemperle, chief people officer of Sweetgreen. \"This has unlocked a way for our candidates to share their passions and their personalities, and to let them shine in a culturally relevant format,\" she said.</p><p>Taylor Haywood, 16, used a TikTok resume to land a part-time social-media specialist position at a Gen Z consulting firm. She said it took three days to shoot the video, but it was worth it.</p><p>Brands that fish for applicants from video resumes might attract more Gen Z consumers as well as workers, said Karin Lewis, a career counselor in Toronto. But creating a good highlight reel isn't always easy, even for younger job seekers who may think they are adept at shooting video, she said.</p><p>\"Interviewing is hard enough at the best of times, but having to develop a script and to speak to a dead camera on the other side is really probably harder,\" Ms. Lewis said.</p><p>While video can capture personality and give a person the ability to steer their narrative -- for instance by explaining a resume gap -- they can take a lot of time to shoot, edit and polish. Video resumes posted to TikTok or other platforms can also lead employers straight to an applicant's social-media pages, so hiring experts suggest making sure those are cleaned up and professional.</p><p>The rise of video resumes is spawning new concerns about hiring discrimination, several workplace experts said. The trend runs counter to recent efforts many companies have been making, such as removing names and photos from resumes, to try to stop unconscious bias from creeping into the process, said Carolyn Kleiman, a career coach at ResumeBuilder.com.</p><p>\"Now, you're asking for a video where you're going to see me and you're going to hear me. That immediately opens the door for some bias,\" Ms. Kleiman said. \"How will companies get around that? I don't know. I'm not sure if they know.\"</p><p>Jade Walters, 21, said that, as a Black woman, she always has the possibility of racial bias in the back of her mind. She has embraced video resumes anyway, she said, because she sees the format as a way to play up her strengths.</p><p>Last month Ms. Walters made a 54-second TikTok video. By mid-July she had heard from a recruiter on TikTok and had several more interviews thanks to recruiters who saw her video on LinkedIn. In early August she accepted a job as a media planner, and said she owes it to her video resume.</p>",
