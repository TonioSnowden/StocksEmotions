  "title": "Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Quarterly Analysis --- In Translation: Explaining Brobdingnagian Base",
  "text": "<p>Coined in the early 2000s by John Roque, now a technical analyst at Wolfe Research in New York, the term draws from Jonathan Swift's classic novel \"Gulliver's Travels\" -- Brobdingnagians are the giants who live in the fictional country of Brobdingnag. Base, meanwhile, refers to a bullish chart pattern where the price of a security or other asset has moved sideways for a period.</p><p>The longer the sideways price action has gone on, the bigger a subsequent rally is expected to be. So-called Brobdingnagian bases are those that have lasted for many years and thus are pointing to the potential for a gigantic rally.</p><p>One historical example of a Brobdingnagian base: Microsoft Corp., which moved sideways from 1999 to 2016. In 2016, it finally broke through the previous all-time high of around $60 reached in 1999. \"At that point, people thought of it as a stodgy old tech stock,\" says Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at New York-based broker-dealer Bay Crest Partners. After the $60 price was breached, the stock continued to rally to more than $220 recently. Simply put, the 17-year-long Brobdingnagian base was a precursor to an almost fourfold jump in the stock price.</p>",
