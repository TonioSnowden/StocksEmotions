  "text": "<p>The buyback tax, which goes into effect Jan. 1, is expected to raise $74 billion in federal revenue over a decade, the nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation has projected.</p><p>Share repurchases by S&amp;P 500 companies reached a record in the first quarter, at $281 billion, surpassing the previous peaks of $223 billion in late 2018 and $270 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.</p><p>Preliminary data show S&amp;P 500 buybacks in the second quarter declined about 19% from the first quarter as worries grew that the economy could slow significantly, but remained above second-quarter 2021 levels, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst with S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. \"The additional tax will not have a material impact on buybacks,\" he predicted.</p><p>The new excise tax -- a last-minute addition to Democratic legislation intended to help pay for spending on climate, healthcare and other initiatives -- is levied on net buybacks, or repurchases offset by new share issuance.</p><p>Based on their 2021 buybacks, the cost to real-estate companies would have been less than 0.1% of income, while the tax bill for tech and communications-services companies would have reached about 0.7% of income for the year.</p><p>Apple Inc. would have paid nearly $900 million in taxes on its net buybacks of $87.7 billion if the tax had been in effect last year, while Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. would have paid about $500 million apiece, the analysis found.</p><p>Four other companies would have seen a tax bill of between $250 million and $275 million on last year's buybacks, including Microsoft Corp., Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Bank of America Corp., the data suggest.</p>",
