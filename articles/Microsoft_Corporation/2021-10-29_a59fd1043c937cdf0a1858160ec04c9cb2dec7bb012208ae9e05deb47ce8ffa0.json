  "title": "Business News:  EV Maker  Aims for  Improved  Ratings  ----  By Nina Trentmann",
  "text": "<p>   Tesla Inc. has won over equity investors, but it still has work to do to convince ratings firms. </p><p>   The electric-car maker on Monday joined a small club of companies valued above $1 trillion. It's the only manufacturing company in the group, alongside technology firms Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Stock-market investors' strong confidence in the company is in stark contrast to the junk ratings on Tesla's debt from S&amp;P Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service. Tesla's trillion-dollar peers all have triple-A ratings, according to data provider FactSet. </p><p>   S&amp;P has increased Tesla's credit rating by five notches over the past year and a half, to BB-plus on Friday, which is one level below investment grade, though with a positive outlook. Moody's upgraded Tesla's rating to Ba3 in March, a category that describes debt that is somewhat speculative in nature and has some exposure to risk. </p><p>   Tesla's high stock price -- its shares closed at $1,077.27 Thursday, up almost 4% from Wednesday's close -- enables the company to sell equity, as it did in December 2020, when it sold $5 billion of its common stock, or offer new convertible notes, analysts and investors said. Tesla's stock started trading at $17 when the company went public in 2010. </p><p>   \"I expect they would get better pricing if they were to offer debt to the market,\" said Eli Pars, co-chief investment officer and head of alternative strategies at Calamos Investments LLC, an investment firm that has bought some of Tesla's convertible debt. Mr. Pars lauded the company's balance sheet, adding that Tesla has turned the corner on improving its operations and scaled up production. </p><p>   \"The equity market might be quicker in rerating the stock [than the ratings firms],\" said Seth Goldstein, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar Inc. </p><p>   Moody's and S&amp;P said that market valuation isn't a factor that contributes directly to a company's rating. While the company currently has the financial profile of an investment-grade company, it faces several business risks, said Nishit Madlani, a senior director at S&amp;P Global Ratings. Among those are competition from other electric-car makers, whether it can meet demand for its products as well as its exposure to future downturns as it produces more cars at an affordable price point, Mr. Madlani said. </p><p>   \"Right now, the story here is that this is a company that's done extremely well by minimizing its financial risk,\" he said. </p><p>   Tesla in its most recent quarter spent $1.5 billion on lease repayments  and to pay down debt, leaving it with cash and cash equivalents of $16.1 billion, up 11% from the prior-year period. </p><p>   Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Kristin Broughton, Mark Maurer and Sam Goldfarb contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
