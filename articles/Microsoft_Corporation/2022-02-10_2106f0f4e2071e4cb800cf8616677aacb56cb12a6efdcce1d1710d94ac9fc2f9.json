  "title": "Senate Approves Bill Barring Forced Arbitration in Sexual-Assault, Harassment Claims; Some lawmakers want to ban such clauses for other complaints, such as racial discrimination",
  "text": "<p>The bill voids existing mandatory arbitration clauses in cases of sexual assault and harassment against employees and customers and bans future ones, but leaves in place other arbitration rules.</p><p>In recent years, companies have grappled with how to better respond to workplace mistreatment of women. Several big companies, including Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Uber Technologies Inc., have said they would end requirements for employee sexual-harassment claims to be handled in private arbitration.</p><p>At a news conference after the vote, senators from both sides of the aisle credited advocates for pressuring Congress to act, including former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson. Ms. Carlson settled a lawsuit in 2016 over her accusation that the network's former top executive, Roger Ailes, had sexually harassed her. Mr. Ailes's attorneys had argued that Ms. Carlson's contract mandated arbitration to address her complaint. Mr. Ailes, who died in 2017, denied all harassment allegations.</p><p>Ms. Carlson said the bill will help stop bad behavior. \"Now the bad actors will know that women's voices will be heard when they speak up about what's really happening at work,\" she said.</p><p>Fox News parent Fox Corp. and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.</p><p>The White House said earlier this month that Mr. Biden strongly supports the bill and wanted to work with Congress to pass legislation addressing mandatory arbitration more broadly, including on claims regarding racial discrimination, wage disputes and labor practices.</p><p>Mandatory-arbitration clauses typically are found in the fine print of everything from employment contracts and credit-card agreements, to ride-share disclosures and leases. They block consumers and employees from raising claims in court, instead sending them to arbitrators who work to resolve complaints privately.</p><p>The companies that put such clauses in their contracts argue that arbitration is more efficient, but consumer advocates say that the confidential system helps businesses evade public accountability.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said she has tried for years to get a blanket ban on mandatory arbitration, but businesses have resisted.</p><p>\"We know that for decades, big corporations forced women to arbitration when they brought actions for sexual assault. That is repulsive,\" Ms. Warren said. \"I hope it is the first step in banning other compulsory arbitration practices\" on other issues, such as racial discrimination, she said.</p><p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has expressed concerns about the bill, saying in a letter to lawmakers last year that the legislation was overly broad and that arbitration \"provides a fair, effective, and less expensive means of resolving disputes compared to going to court.\"</p><p>Camille Olson, a partner at Seyfarth Shaw LLP who represents big corporations in labor and employment disputes, said many companies already exclude sexual assault and sexual-harassment claims from their mandatory arbitration programs, and some states have laws in place that restrict arbitration.</p><p>Ms. Olson said she has been receiving questions from companies about how the act would affect existing arbitration claims and has advised them that the bill applies only to disputes or claims made after it is enacted.</p><p>Not all senators were enthusiastic about the bill's passage, despite the voice vote. It is rare for a major piece of legislation to pass the Senate without a member of either party calling for senators to record their \"yes\" or \"no\" votes.</p><p>\"I think it should be renamed the trial lawyers bonanza bill,\" said Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas). \"Having access to a jury trial, a court of law, isn't necessarily the only way or even the most efficient or cost effective way of resolving disputes,\" Mr. Cornyn said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What impact would barring mandatory arbitration in cases of sexual assault and harassment have on the workplace? Join the conversation below.</p><p>He said lawmakers need to make sure that arbitration agreements are fair, but he warned the legislation could be a first step in an effort to eliminate all contractual arbitration.</p><p>Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.), a lawyer, said he doesn't have concerns about frivolous suits. He said he still expects some people filing complaints of sexual assault and harassment to choose arbitration, since the bill gives them a choice. Sen. Joni Ernst (R., Iowa) said she decided to support the bill after its sponsors agreed to clarify on the Senate floor that the legislation should be narrowly interpreted and not effectively eliminate arbitration in employment-related claims.</p><p>Both Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), the bill's Republican sponsor, and the lead Democratic sponsor, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.), said in their own floor remarks that unrelated workplace or consumer complaints shouldn't be able to escape the mandatory- arbitration process unless they are related to sexual-assault or harassment claims.</p><p>Mr. Graham called the bill the most significant workplace reform since the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and said he is open to further changes to arbitration law, on a bipartisan basis.</p><p>\"Arbitration has its place in the American legal system. It's just got to be balanced,\" Mr. Graham said.</p><p>The Federal Arbitration Act, signed by President Calvin Coolidge in 1925, requires courts to defer when private parties agree in advance to resolve disputes through private arbitration rather than through the justice system. The aim, a House report said, was to combat \"the costliness and delays of litigation.\"</p><p>While initially employed in business-to-business disputes, arbitration clauses increasingly have been added by companies to boilerplate contracts they apply to consumers and employees. Supreme Court decisions in recent decades have made such arbitration clauses nearly sacrosanct, applying the Federal Arbitration Act to pre-empt state laws that entitle consumers or workers to file joint complaints or class actions, or to have their claims heard in court.</p><p>The court's current term includes several arbitration cases. In March, for instance, the court will hear arguments over the extent of the arbitration act's exemption for transportation workers engaged in interstate commerce. Although the case, Southwest Airlines Co. v. Saxon, involves baggage loaders, ride-share companies Uber and Lyft Inc. have filed briefs urging the court to limit the exemption so that their drivers wouldn't qualify.</p><p>Linda Friedman, a partner at Stowell &amp; Friedman who has represented employees in discrimination suits including a racial-bias case against Merrill Lynch that the firm settled for $160 million, said that the bill would bring fairness to matters involving sexual harassment and assault but that it should be extended to other claims, including those alleging racial discrimination.</p><p>Khadeeja Safdar contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com and Jess Bravin at jess.bravin+1@wsj.com</p><p>Senate Approves Bill Barring Forced Arbitration in Sexual-Assault, Harassment Claims</p>",
