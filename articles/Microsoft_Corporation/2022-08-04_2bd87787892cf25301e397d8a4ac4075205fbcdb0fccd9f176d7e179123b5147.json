  "text": "<p>   Microsoft, meanwhile, came to the table early in Netflix's hunt for a partner with a much smaller ad business than Google and Comcast. Unlike those firms, however, it lacked a competing streaming business. Executives stressed the word \"agnostic\" in their pitches and their willingness to be a partner as Netflix eventually stood up its own ad-selling business. </p><p>   Netflix's negotiations with potential partners were heating up as the advertising industry descended on the French Riviera in June for the Cannes Lions advertising festival, where tech and media executives, sipping rose on yachts, woo big-spending advertisers. </p><p>   While Cannes was teeming, as usual, with celebrities -- among them, Ryan Reynolds, Lupita Nyong'o and Dua Lipa -- in the ad world the star attraction was Mr. Sarandos of Netflix. He used the event to hold discussions with several large advertisers and high-ranking ad agency executives, said people familiar with the situation. He also attended a Google dinner that featured Mark Read, the CEO of ad-giant WPP Plc, and Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, among others. </p><p>   During the festivities in Cannes, NBCUniversal tried to drop out of the mix, deciding that the bidding -- and Netflix's asks -- had reached a level where the media company couldn't envision a profitable partnership, people close to the discussions said. Netflix eventually persuaded NBCUniversal to re-engage. Google sensed by the end of June its chances were dimming, a person familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   In the background, the Netflix talks with Microsoft had quietly advanced. </p><p>   Netflix and Microsoft announced their ad partnership on July 13, shortly after the annual gathering of tech and media moguls in Sun Valley, Idaho. Some Comcast NBCUniversal executives were upset when they discovered Netflix's attempts to poach its top talent during the partnership talks, which they viewed as unprofessional, people close to the company said. Netflix also made hiring inquiries at Google, according to a person familiar with the talks. </p><p>   Many advertisers are already plotting how to use Netflix as a marketing platform. </p><p>   One thing they will want to know: how many people they are reaching through Netflix ads. </p><p>   Netflix said for years that it didn't need to publish ratings for its content because it wasn't selling ads. More recently, the company has begun providing some viewership information, such as a look at the top 10 programs on the service. Netflix will have to be even more transparent after launching an ad-supported plan, since advertisers will be looking to pay based on the quality of that data, said Ms. Millard, the former MediaLink executive. </p><p></p>",
