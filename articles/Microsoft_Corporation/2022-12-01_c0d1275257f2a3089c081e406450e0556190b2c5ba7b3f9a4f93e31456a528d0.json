  "text": "<p>* Liverpool</p><p>* Phoenix Suns</p><p>* The Los Angeles Angels</p><p>* The Washington Commanders aka Dan Snyder's Washington Sadness Machine</p><p>If you're in the market, there's never been a more intriguing billionaire's bazaar for sports teams. Currently for sale are two iconic English Premier League soccer clubs, a well-known NBA franchise still chasing a title, an underwhelming baseball club with a historic duo, and a colossal NFL train wreck you'll be a hero just for buying.</p><p>For this hypothetical shopping spree, I've made you a billionaire, many times over. How? You invented a silent pickleball, and hold the patent. You can write one fat check, or drop off a giant duffel bag—you don't have to scrape together a group of loser co-investors.</p><p>(If you're a real billionaire, kudos, but get back to work! No one ever stayed a billionaire reading about Dutch bike racing and cats.)</p><p>So which team do you want? The Angels and Suns might be the most affordable buys, even if they're expected to fetch somewhere close to $3 billion, which would be a record for both MLB and the NBA. Liverpool is said to be worth somewhere north of $4.5 billion. Manchester United will surely want more than that. The Sadness Machine is reportedly tagged at an absurd $7 billion, but who knows, they may get it. The Sadness Machine is playing some solid football right now!</p><p>Remember: You can afford this. I talked to your accountant. You've sold a ton of silent pickleballs.</p><p>If you're looking for the biggest brand, it's got to be Manchester United. They've been on a rough ride in recent years, but the Glazer family investment is arguably the best known professional team on planet Earth, ahead of the Yankees, the Lakers, and even the Seattle Kraken. This team has won 20 league titles, minted global names like David Beckham, and its home, Old Trafford, is revered like Yankee Stadium.</p><p>In buying Man U, or Liverpool, you're skipping a stage of the sports ownership cycle. In recent years, U.S. sports owners have begun crossing the Atlantic to add soccer to the portfolio, a development with…mixed results! John Henry of the Red Sox put together a group to buy Liverpool, which went on to win Premier League and Champions League titles, but American owners continue to be viewed with great skepticism. Support for the failed push for a greedy \"Super League\" didn't help, either.</p><p>The \"Super League\" backlash underlined an important point: You're not going to really \"own\" this team. A lot of European soccer teams behave like ancient public trusts, with deep loyalties and suspicion of outsiders. Owners aren't revered the way they are in the U. S.—they aren't obsequiously addressed as \"Mr.\" or \"Ms.\", they don't get to hold the championship trophy before the players do. (That's for weirdo Americans.)</p><p>If you're buying Man U, supporters will let you write the transfer fee checks, but it isn't actually yours. They're letting you \"borrow\" it until you mess it up, then they're calling for the next owner.</p><p>Still: What'd be cooler than owning an EPL club? Wanna hop on the jet and come see us play Man City? sounds a lot more glam than Um, we've got a doubleheader with the Marlins.</p><p>Which leads us to the Angels, and the prospect of baseball ownership. This is a perplexing item: You're getting a blah franchise that can't seem to make the playoffs but you're also landing two superstars in Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani. You're probably going to have to gut the team to rebuild, and say farewell to a pair of players you'll one day see bronzed in Cooperstown. You're also investing billions in baseball, which might be like betting on the revival of Betamax, or mail delivered by pony. On the plus side, you get a delightful stadium with a fake rock waterfall that looks stolen from a '90s McMansion.</p><p>An NBA team has its perks, too. Perk No. 1: Courtside seats! Come on: You don't want to hide in a luxury box, do you? Will you sit under the hoop, or close to the bench? Are you stoic like a Sphinx, or will you be like Steve Ballmer, who always waves his arms like he's trying to scare off a bear?</p><p>The Suns have never won an NBA title, but they're a solid outfit, currently atop the Western Conference standings. I'm not saying you're going to win the championship right away, but you'll beat the heck out of the lousy Lakers a few times, which is almost as fun.</p><p>By now we know the secret to successful sports ownership: hire quality people, treat them well, and stay out of the way. Sure, they'll listen to your daffy ideas on draft night, or indulge the story of the time you sank a half-court shot to beat Phillips Andover, but they're going to roll their eyes behind your back. The Meddler is the worst owner. Would you let an NBA executive tell you what secret polymers are needed to make the perfect silent pickleball? I didn't think so.</p><p>Our final team to consider is the Sadness Machine, aka the Washington Commanders. Shambolic management state, enormous upside. These fans want regime change more than they want a Lombardi Trophy. They're going to throw a parade the day you finish the paperwork. Tell them you're going to move the team back to the District, and they'll rename the Washington Monument after you.</p><p>With all of these teams, you've got to be wary of the Bezos Swoop—it's possible you're just driving up the price before the Amazon magnate or some other superplutocrat jumps in—but that's the hazard of the billionaire's life. You're a shark in a sea of sharks. Did you let that other billionaire beat you out for that custom Norwegian yacht that looks like a space toilet? I didn't think so. And now you own a $300 million space toilet you never sail. At least you don't own Twitter.</p><p>You're a winner. You own everything a human being could desire—except a sports franchise which will likely bring you more heartache than anything in your life and for which you'll be blamed every time something bad happens.</p><p>Hard to say no to that! So which team do you want?</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>So, which of the five would you buy, and why?</p><p>Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com</p><p>Congrats, You're a Billionaire. Which Sports Team Would You Buy?</p>",
