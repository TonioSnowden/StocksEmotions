  "title": "Business News:  Hasbro Names Digital-Games Chief CEO  ----  By Paul Ziobro",
  "text": "<p>    Hasbro Inc. named Chris Cocks as its chief executive, elevating the head of the toy company's \"Wizards of the Coast\" and digital-games division to fill the top job following the death of Brian Goldner in October. </p><p>   Mr. Cocks, 48 years old, is a former Microsoft Corp. executive who joined Hasbro in 2016 to head up the division best known for the \"Magic: The Gathering\" card game and \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons.\" As president and operating chief, he pushed the unit more into digital games, helping it to double revenue during his tenure to over $1 billion in 2021. </p><p>   Though a relative newcomer and based in Renton, Wash., Mr. Cocks will look to continue the blueprint at Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., established under Mr. Goldner. The strategy focuses on developing strong story lines across the company's brands, which in turn drives sales of toys, games and other merchandise. </p><p>   \"I am humbled to step into the position of CEO at this important time and to build on the strong foundation Brian created,\" said Mr. Cocks, who assumes the role Feb. 25. </p><p>   The appointment comes as the toy industry has enjoyed a strong run during the pandemic, with parents splurging on toys and games. </p><p></p>",
