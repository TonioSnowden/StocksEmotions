  "title": "Videogame Stocks Jump After Microsoft Agrees to Buy Activision Blizzard; Electronic Arts, Ubisoft shares rise following the disclosure of the planned deal",
  "text": "<p>The moves in videogame stocks came as major U.S. indexes fell. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.9% and the Nasdaq Composite declined 2.4%, hurt by a rise in treasury yields.</p><p>The purchase of Activision will accelerate more deals in the industry, analysts said, as big tech companies seek to broaden their consumer offerings by acquiring companies that attracted players during the pandemic. Microsoft's purchase of Activision, which owns the Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush franchises, would also help the company edge into the streaming and metaverse spaces, they added.</p><p>\"It's going to start a major ripple effect in terms of consolidation for other videogame publishers,\" said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.</p><p>The deal is the second big transaction involving videogame companies this year. Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. on Jan. 10 announced plans to acquire Zynga Inc. in a roughly $11 billion deal.</p><p>Not all videogame companies' shares rose Tuesday. Roblox, which went public last March, has seen its shares fall about 40% from highs in mid-November. Its stock was recently down 1.6%.</p><p>\"As more big tech and media companies recognize the reach and spend that gaming drives, as well as gaming's tip of the spear position for future metaverse opportunities, we expect to see further M&amp;A in the space,\" said Andrew Marok, an analyst at Raymond James &amp; Associates, in a note.</p><p>Videogame Stocks Jump After Microsoft Agrees to Buy Activision Blizzard</p>",
