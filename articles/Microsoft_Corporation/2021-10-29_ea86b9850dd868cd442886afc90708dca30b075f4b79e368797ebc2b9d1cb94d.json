New Enterprise Associates is raising a total of about $7 billion for a pair of funds, one for early-stage startup deals and another for later-stage rounds, according to people familiar with the situation, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova and Preeti Singh report. The effort represents a change to NEA's longtime strategy of investing out of a single multistage fund.</p><p>The firm is looking to raise just under $3 billion for its early-stage strategy, New Enterprise Associates 18 LP, and about $4 billion for NEA 18 Venture Growth Equity LP, the people said. This represents a large step up from its previous fundraising, which totaled $3.6 billion in early 2020 for its 17th main fund.</p><p>NEA's decision to create separate funds for investments by stage reflects what's happening in the venture market broadly. \"A lot of firms have been raising multiple funds delineated by stage, but also sometimes by sector or geography as well,\" said Aakar Vachhani, a partner at Fairview Capital, speaking generally about the venture market.</p><p>$100 Million</p><p>Amount raised by Lovevery in its latest funding round, valuing the trendy subscription toy company at more than $800 million.

Florida-based Terran designs and builds satellites for customers including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the U.S. Defense Department and EchoStar Corp., a provider of satellite and internet communication services.

The task force called on governments to broaden regulatory oversight of crypto firms and force more of them to take measures such as checking the identities of their customers and reporting suspicious transactions to regulators. The FATF's guidelines don't have the force of law, and would need to be implemented by national regulators in each country. Still, the Paris-based group is influential in setting standards for government policies against money laundering and financing of terrorism, and its guidelines could shape new crypto regulations around the world.</p><p>\"It would be inappropriate for anything like these non-specific and confusing standards to replace the current law and regulations we have on the books here in the U.S.\"</p><p>— Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director at crypto advocacy group Coin Center, wrote in a blog post Thursday about the FATF guidelines.</p><p>Experience Management Forum</p><p>If you are interested in fintech and customer experience, come along to the WSJ Experience Management Forum on Nov. 1.
