  "title": "Stocks Dive on Vaccine Shortage",
  "text": "<p>The blue-chip index fell 633.87 points, or 2.1%, to 30303.17, extending its losing streak to five sessions, and the S&amp;P 500 dropped 98.85 points, or 2.6%, to 3750.77. The Nasdaq Composite lost 355.47 points, or 2.6%, to 13270.60. All three indexes posted their biggest one-day losses on a point and percentage basis since Oct. 28.</p><p>New variants of the Covid-19 virus are showing up around the world, putting fresh pressure on governments to get their populations vaccinated. That exacerbates the peril from any delays in the vaccination programs, and the ability to eventually end lockdowns or other restrictions.</p><p>AstraZeneca has said problems at a European factory would sharply cut supplies to EU nations. The EU this week pressured the drugmaker to instead supply it with vaccine from its U.K. factories if need be, which would then affect the rollout in the U.K.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Biden administration said Tuesday it would purchase enough additional coronavirus shots to vaccinate most of the U.S. with a two-dose regimen by the end of summer. Several cities and other jurisdictions have reported vaccine shortages.</p><p>\"I think the market expected that by now we would be talking about loosening, not tightening restrictions,\" said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. \"On the vaccine rollout, this is very problematic for the near term. It is very critical for shaping the growth bounceback, and these issues are just adding more delay to that.\"</p><p>While questions about the pace of vaccine rollout and the economic recovery are real, they aren't new issues for investors, said Victoria Fernandez, the chief market strategist at Crossmark Global Investments. Given the market's run to new highs, it isn't surprising that investors are a bit worn out, she said. \"I really think it's a hodgepodge of different things and the market is saying, 'you know what, we're taking a breather.'\"</p><p>The most fascinating market dynamic, however, remains the day-trader-driven gains for heavily shorted stocks like GameStop .</p><p>The gains have been driven largely by day traders on the social-media message board Reddit, who have en masse been buying up the stock, squeezing short sellers.</p><p>GameStop 's rise this year on its own comprises nearly a full percentage point of the small-cap S&amp;P 600's gains, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices . The index is up 9.9% this year, while the S&amp;P 500 is down 0.1%. GameStop is the index's largest issue. At the end of 2020, less than a month ago, it ranked 287.</p><p>The Reddit crowd's piles into these stocks resemble centuryold pump-and-dump schemes from the 1920s, said Hans Olsen, the chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co.</p><p>Back then, stock operators would pool money to pump up the price of a targeted stock. Once the public caught wind of the moves and bought, the operators would sell at a profit. Those schemes didn't have a convenient platform like Reddit through which traders could coordinate.</p><p>\"This is old stuff coming new again,\" Mr. Olsen said, \"and facilitated in a way we haven't seen, by social media.\"</p><p>In the afternoon, the Federal Reserve said it would maintain its current monetary policies while acknowledging the economy has softened in recent weeks. But the first question Chairman Jerome Powell fielded in his press conference was in fact about the trading in GameStop .</p><p>He said he wasn't going to comment on a particular stock or day's market activity. In response to another question about financial bubbles, he played down the role of Fed policy in driving asset prices.</p><p>Shares of Microsoft rose 57 cents, or 0.3% to $232.90 after the company reported record quarterly sales on Tuesday. Walgreens Boots Alliance was up $1.99, or 4.1%, to $51.18 after the drugstore chain named Starbucks operating chief Rosalind Brewer as its next chief executive.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 1.2%, while in Asia, stock indexes closed mixed. Early Thursday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 1.1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 1.9% and the Shanghai Composite was down 1.3%. U.S. stock futures were down 0.4%.</p>",
