MoMA once held a garden party to celebrate Black's “important contributions to the cultural community” alongside those of Hollywood auteur <strong>Martin Scorsese</strong>.</p> <p>A year later the billionaire is not only in retreat, but at war with former allies.</p> <p>Black <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1cb72364-b477-47a5-b215-746e21acaab2\">quit Apollo</a> and MoMA last year after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f494b534-8d1e-4d76-bf8c-a08826a21482\">revelations</a> that he paid $158m to the late paedophile <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong> for financial advice and other professional services.</p> <p>He is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5146672c-73b6-43df-b25d-e0162ad3d6a2\">fighting a lawsuit</a> from a former mistress, <strong>Guzel Ganieva</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba1a0cef-f25c-42bd-ae12-ac4dfb6971d7\">who says</a> Black abused her during their relationship and then damaged her reputation by publicly accusing her of extortion.</p> <p>And on Wednesday he traded sharp words publicly with two people who were once among his closest associates.</p> <p>The exchange began when Black's lawyers filed a motion asking a court to uphold a subpoena for Ganieva's phone records. They say the documents could help Black defend himself against the lawsuit, which they have branded “a work of fiction”.</p> <p>In their filing, the lawyers spelt out a theory that<strong> Josh Harris</strong>, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e18c9f2b-e62d-4087-88b0-51fe3d9476cd\">until last year</a> was one of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25391271-1096-409c-8206-4419bc997735\">top three partners</a> at Apollo, had exploited the Epstein scandal to launch an “attempted . . . coup and smear campaign” in an effort to succeed Black as CEO.</p> <p>They added that Harris had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a2dc2c2-2f05-49ff-b2a0-2d6d019a9cab\">enlisted PR guru</a> <strong>Steven Rubenstein</strong> to “help seed harmful stories about Mr Black”.</p> <p>DD's Mark Vandevelde <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da3ae062-1b7c-41f5-ab78-07a7c6989379\">broke the news</a> on Wednesday evening — and drew some scathing rebuttals.</p> <p>A spokesman for Harris called the claims in Black's filing “unhinged”.</p> <p>Rubenstein's attorney, <strong>Evan Farber</strong>, said Black's lawyers were putting forward “a concocted, ever-evolving conspiracy theory, packed with false information and . . . not based in reality”.</p> <p>Harris and Rubenstein both say they have never had any contact with Ganieva or her representatives and have no involvement with her lawsuit.</p> <p>In a separate lawsuit, Black has accused Ganieva and her lawyers at <strong>Wigdor</strong> of conspiring with a mysterious “funder” to extort him. Wigdor has asked a court to punish Black's legal team for filing that lawsuit, which they called “factually and legally baseless”.</p> <p>Apollo said it had nothing to do with any of the litigation between Black and Ganieva and added: “This is an entirely personal matter.”</p> <h2>A years-long legal battle comes back to bite McKinsey</h2> <p>The feud between restructuring specialist <strong>Jay Alix </strong>and management consultant <strong>McKinsey</strong> has been a notably bitter one, grinding on for almost four years since the restructuring industry pioneer credited with contributing the word “turnround” to the dictionary sued the consultancy in 2018.</p> <p>The founder of <strong>AlixPartners</strong> had watched McKinsey push into his core business of advising companies going through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, and smelled a rat. </p> <p>The well-connected consultancy hadn't been upfront about its other ties to interested parties in several cases, he alleged, which might have barred it from lucrative contracts had they been known to the bankruptcy courts.</p> <p>McKinsey vigorously denied Alix's claim that it had knowingly failed to disclose conflicts of interest. It <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf62aa32-9b89-11e9-9c06-a4640c9feebb\">seemed to have prevailed</a> in 2019, when a judge in the<strong> Southern District of New York</strong>, where he had filed his suit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, dismissed the case. </p> <p>Alix, the judge found, hadn't demonstrated a sufficiently direct connection between the alleged fraud and the damage he said his own business had suffered.</p> <p>This week, the FT's US business editor Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a74d5ca-8b00-4224-acac-bad9d974eae9\">wrote</a> that an appeals court disagreed, arguing that Alix had “adequately pleaded bankruptcy fraud” and that the case should go ahead.</p> <p>That means not only that the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63f24181-aee0-49f4-9966-a447d79692f0\">scandal-hit</a> consultancy's lawyers will find themselves back in court, but that some of its top consultants will have to defend themselves too. </p> <p>Alix sued not only the consultancy and three of its subsidiaries, but several of its partners too.<strong> Bob Sternfels</strong>, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0619e19-2696-4ed4-9538-7ce5c2b9357f\">took over</a> as leader of the partnership last year after his peers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b0f92d6-8aea-4e15-b108-a86f31443f99\">denied</a><strong> Kevin Sneader</strong> the customary second term as senior managing partner, is one of them. </p> <p>So is <strong>Dominic Barton</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1c2b112-bd7f-11e7-9836-b25f8adaa111\">former senior managing partner</a> who became Canada's ambassador to China and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4bf9016e-fb54-4068-a103-911cb2187f5e\">was named</a> the new chair of <strong>Rio Tinto </strong>just last month.</p> <p>McKinsey's lawyers were busy enough already: last year “the firm” paid out more than $600m to settle opioid litigation brought by all 50 US states. That has not stopped scores of US counties, cities and tribes from bringing their own lawsuits: a hearing on a case consolidating 100 of them is expected at the end of March.</p> <p>McKinsey says it is confident that the evidence will show that the Alix lawsuit is “meritless”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Whatever happens in the Alix case, the bankruptcy practice that once looked like a lucrative growth area has already proven costly. In 2019 McKinsey had to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd3b119a-3476-11e9-bb0c-42459962a812\">pay $15m</a> to the <strong>Department of Justice</strong> to resolve claims that it had failed to comply with conflicts of interest disclosure rules over two decades.</p> <p>In a firm where such sums eat into the profit pool that partners share, Sternfels will no doubt be keen to avoid more costly legal payouts.</p> <h2>Wall Street pays the price for a banner year in M&amp;A</h2> <p>Minting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6dfdd78a-e229-4524-a400-144396524eb6\">$5.8tn in deals</a> doesn't come cheap. </p> <p>Behind the historic number of mergers and acquisitions in 2021 — and the record-breaking $157bn in fees that came with it — was an army of overworked investment bankers shuffled to and fro from fluorescently lit cubicles to their home offices, depending on what phase of the pandemic we were in.</p> <p>Such gruelling hours have added up, the FT's Josh Franklin and Imani Moise find, as Wall Street's top banks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bdef7a6-69f1-4f42-b27d-74dd34db4804\">raised pay by nearly 15 per cent</a> last year amid the dealmaking boom-fuelled war for talent.</p> <p>“It's just a competitive landscape for talent. You can't automate an M&amp;A transaction,” Jason Goldberg, bank analyst at Barclays, said.</p> <p>The authors behind last year's infamous<strong> Goldman Sachs </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d853d6b4-1546-4435-9b7e-99e3e9475d50\">slide deck</a>, which recounted junior staff's 95-hour workweeks and deteriorating mental health, might agree. The warning by the bank's CEO <strong>David Solomon</strong> of “wage inflation everywhere” echoes just how expensive a “pay for performance” structure can be when bankers perform around the clock.</p> <p>The rising threat of fintech also tested banks' bottom lines, as they spend on new technology to keep pace with industry disrupters such as <strong>Square</strong> and its August <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a09dd665-1b76-478c-a50d-e40340b29b7b\">acquisition</a> of <strong>Afterpay</strong>.<strong> JPMorgan Chase</strong>'s “astonishing” $12bn of spending on tech last year appears to be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e543adf0-8c62-4a2c-b2d9-01fdb2f595cc\">just the beginning</a>.</p> <p>DD would also factor in the price of retaining Wall Street veterans from straying to shiny new opportunities in Silicon Valley.</p> <p>With the sector as hot as it is now, who wouldn't be itching to be the next <strong>Steve McLaughlin</strong> — who left Goldman in 2002 to launch <strong>FT Partners </strong>and ride the fintech wave to become one of the top-paid investment bankers in America.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Barclays</strong> has named former French finance minister<strong> François Baroin</strong> as chair of the bank in France.
