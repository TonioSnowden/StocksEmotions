  "title": "Scope of Cyberattacks Expanded This Year",
  "text": "<p>But cyberattacks on major technology providers and the interconnected world of software and hardware that power the global economy continued at a relentless pace in 2021, according to U.S. officials and security experts. Instead of one company being victimized at a time like in a traditional data breach, thousands were often exposed simultaneously. Businesses, hospitals and schools also worked to defend themselves against an onslaught of ransomware attacks, which increasingly reap $10 million or more in extortion payments.</p><p>The annus horribilis culminated this month with discovery of a flaw in an obscure but widely used internet code known as Log4j, which one senior Biden administration official said was the worst she had seen in her career. The latest vulnerability comes as U.S. officials warn corporate leaders of a potential surge of cyberattacks while businesses slow their operations during the holiday season.</p><p>The string of incidents highlights how decades of digital transformation have linked business and government computer systems in opaque and sometimes surprising ways that will create new vulnerabilities. Major disruptions are certain to continue, cybersecurity officials said. \"Network defenders are exhausted,\" said Joe Slowik, threat-intelligence lead at the security firm Gigamon. New attention and investment in cybersecurity hasn't improved the status quo, he said.</p><p>A hack of the Microsoft Corp. Exchange email software in March, later attributed by Western nations to China, rendered tens of thousands of victims across the globe vulnerable to destructive attacks. In July, an attack on Dutch enterprise-software provider Kaseya by a criminal gang of Russian hackers was used as a springboard for ransomware strikes.</p><p>Earlier this month, the flaw found in Log4j, a routine piece of free software, prompted especially grave warnings, with some officials estimating that hundreds of millions of devices are at risk. The reliance on intertwined software and hardware ensures that a vulnerability hidden in a tool such as Log4j can cause wide-ranging disruption.</p><p>\"When there's a risk in one part of the system, it has the potential for a global ripple effect,\" said Sherri Davidoff, chief executive of the cyber firm LMG Security.</p><p>Since the Log4J vulnerability was publicly disclosed earlier this month, cybersecurity researchers have warned of hackers linked to the Russian, Chinese, Turkish and Iranian governments exploiting the flaw. The Belgian Defense Ministry has reported a breach to its systems, while companies ranging from a German chemical firm to a Milwaukee-based industrial-parts supplier have rushed to shore up their networks, taking portions offline as a precaution.</p><p>U.S. officials and security experts said the past year has been one of the worst on record for cybersecurity, marked not just by such repeated discoveries of bugs considered historic in their scope and potential severity but an onslaught of ransomware attacks on businesses and critical infrastructure as well.</p><p>A May attack on Colonial Pipeline shut down the main conduit of fuel for the East Coast, and was followed by a similar attack in June that disrupted a large meat distributor. A surge of such attacks this year prompted the Biden administration to identify ransomware as a top threat to national security, and President Biden has repeatedly tried to pressure his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, to crack down on ransomware groups operating within his borders.</p><p>There are also far more deep-pocketed buyers in what is known as the zero-day market for high-powered hacking tools, officials and experts said. Researchers at Alphabet Inc.'s Google have identified 57 zero-days used by attackers in 2021, according to data shared with The Wall Street Journal, more than double the total seen last year.</p>",
