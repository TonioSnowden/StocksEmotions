  "title": "10 Last-Minute Digital Gifts That Beat Basic Gift Cards for Christmas; It might be too late to ship a present—but it isn't too late to get something worthwhile for your favorite people",
  "text": "<p>Christmas is less than 48 hours away. If you aren't done buying gifts, you've likely missed the shipping deadlines to send them through the mail. You may think you're left with few options—a generic gift card, a handwritten check or an IOU under the tree—but we've rounded up some great last-minute presents that don't need a shipping label or a trip to the store.</p><p>In fact, because they focus on what people can use year-round, and in the comfort of their home as Omicron makes the rounds, these ideas might be a bigger hit than anything wrapped with a bow. Here's our list:</p><p>Intro</p><p>Does your giftee have big career ambitions or a major project to tackle? Sign them up for a consultation from Intro. The app, which launched in November, allows users to video chat one-on-one with celebrities and experts. This could be ideal for a small-business owner or someone completing a home-renovation project.</p><p>Sessions range from $50 to $200 and cover categories such as fashion, beauty, interior design and fitness. To give a gift, you have to sign up on the Intro app, which is free to do. Then tap the settings icon and scroll to gift cards.</p><p>MasterClass</p><p>This e-learning platform offers a range of classes taught by some of the biggest names in their fields. Your gift recipient can learn photography skills from Annie Leibovitz or screenwriting tips from Aaron Sorkin. Memberships start from $15 a month.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass for PC</p><p>Microsoft's subscription service will grant gamers access to over 100 games playable on computers and consoles—but no Xbox is required. To give a three-month subscription, pay $29.99 for a digital access code on GameStop's website.</p><p>Aaptiv</p><p>An Aaptiv subscription unlocks access to more than 6,000 virtual exercise classes and personalized training across categories like running, yoga and weightlifting. Just enter your recipient's name and email address to send them training access for a year. A membership costs $49.99.</p><p>Ancestry.com</p><p>Ancestry.com offers a Discovery membership that provides access to family records for six to 12 months. During a promotional period through the end of 2021, the non-renewing half-year plan starts at $79 for access to records from the U.S. At the high end, an All Access pass, which includes military records and old newspapers, will cost $272 for a year.</p><p>The Chef &amp; The Dish</p><p>This online coaching platform provides 2.5-hour virtual cooking classes with chefs from around the globe. Classes are $299, but you can give a recipient as little as $100 toward a class.</p><p>Fender Play</p><p>This virtual school offers guided guitar, bass and ukulele lessons. A new beta feature listens to your playing and gives basic feedback on your performance. The app-based program is available in six- and 12-month subscription options, starting at $49.99.</p><p>Nintendo Switch Online</p><p>If your loved one has a Nintendo Switch, you could buy a 12-month online membership for $19.99.</p><p>It grants access to more than 100 games that can be played through Nintendo's cloud, rather than on the console itself.</p><p>Amazon Prime</p><p>Rather than Amazon credit, you cangive Prime membership, which means they will get free faster shipping, movie and TV streaming, ebooks and unlimited photo storage. A year costs $119, but you can give just three months for $39.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What are you doing for last-minute gifts?
