  "text": "<p>Twenty years ago Microsoft's core business was Windows software for consumers and enterprises. The company already made games for PC, but the Xbox wasn't launched until late 2001.</p><p>Under Steve Ballmer, Microsoft attempted to diversify into online search, digital advertising and entertainment. That year, Microsoft also made one of its first big steps into the cloud with the public launch of Office 365, its effort to deliver its suite of workplace applications through a subscription-based cloud offering.</p><p>Microsoft now breaks out gaming as its own segment. That growth has been overshadowed by its rapidly growing cloud services, but a string of gaming-related acquisitions suggests that the company is looking to expand further into the space.</p><p>In addition to the Activision Blizzard deal, Microsoft acquired Doom owner ZeniMax Media Inc. last year, Minecraft maker Mojang AB in 2014 and Rare Ltd. in 2002.</p><p>The 2021 gaming revenue is the equivalent of 40% of Microsoft's total revenue 20 years ago.</p><p>Ana Rivas contributed to this article.</p><p>The Growing Importance of Gaming for Microsoft</p>",
