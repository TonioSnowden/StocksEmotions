  "text": "<p>Venture funds that have a specific climate-tech focus, meanwhile, are raised faster than other venture funds, according to data from Silicon Valley Bank.</p><p>Back during the cleantech boom of the mid- to late-2000s, it took climate-focused funds nine months to get to a final close, according to the bank. That time extended to two years in the middle of the last decade, when LP skepticism about such strategies increased.</p><p>In recent years, however, growing LP appetite has meant that a median climate-focused venture fund takes just 12 months to reach a final close, five months faster than industry average.</p><p>And now on to the news ...</p><p>Top News</p><p>What ESG proof?

Mr. Draper previously invested in companies including Skype, SpaceX, Robinhood and Theranos.</p><p>\"When you start putting regulations down, everything gets ruined, particularly in a venture fund,\" he said. \"It's better to think: ‘Is this a future I want?'\"</p><p>$1 Trillion</p><p>Roughly the size of the new infrastructure bill President Biden signed into law to repair the nation's aging roads and bridges, upgrade the electrical grid and expand access to broadband internet.</p><p>Chamath Palihapitiya's Social Capital Leads $20 Million Funding Round for Battery Startup</p><p>Billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya's Social Capital Holdings Inc. is leading a $20 million funding round for a startup that hopes to use machine learning to address the difficulty of producing electric-vehicle battery components outside China, WSJ reports.
