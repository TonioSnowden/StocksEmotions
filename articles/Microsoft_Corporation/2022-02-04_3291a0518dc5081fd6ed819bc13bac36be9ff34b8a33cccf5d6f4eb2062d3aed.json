  "text": "<p>Take-Two TTWO shares rallied as much as 7% Friday, popping from a loss to a gain after the news was announced, differing from other videogame stocks that recently reported earnings — Electronic Arts Inc. EAshares declined as much as 2%, and Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI shares were relatively flat. EA had forecast slower-than-expected growth in its earnings report late Tuesday, while Microsoft Corp.'s MSFT $69 billion offer for Activision Blizzard cushioned that publishers ‘disappointing' earnings report late Thursday.</p><p>In a blog post, Rockstar Games said that in addition to “Grand Theft Auto V” and “Grand Theft Auto Online” coming to Sony Group Corp.'s SONYJP:6758 PlayStation 5 and to Microsoft's Xbox X|S platforms on March 15, the studio was confirming recent speculation concerning the next major iteration of the series, what would ostensibly be called “Grand Theft Auto VI.”</p><p>See also: ‘Grand Theft Auto V” has made more money than any movie ever</p><p>“With the unprecedented longevity of GTAV, we know many of you have been asking us about a new entry in the Grand Theft Auto series,” Rockstar Games said in a statement. “With every new project we embark on, our goal is always to significantly move beyond what we have previously delivered — and we are pleased to confirm that active development for the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series is well underway.”</p><p>“Grand Theft Auto V,” which was first released in late 2013, had more than $6 billion in all-time sales, making it the biggest selling media title of all time.</p><p>The announcement comes ahead of Take-Two's earnings report scheduled after the close of markets on Monday. The studio said that it will share more details “as soon as we are ready.”</p>",
