  "title": "Arista's Meta Boom Will Be Real Enough; Major supplier of network equipment to Facebook parent projects big sales jump next year",
  "text": "<p>The network-equipment maker projected a major jump in business next year during an analyst meeting late Monday. Arista said it expects revenue to grow about 30% in 2022â€”far above the 13% pace that analysts had been expecting. Arista didn't cite the company once known as Facebook as the reason for the uplift, but Meta Platforms has been second only to Microsoft among Arista's largest customers over the past two years. The forecast came just a week after Facebook surprised Wall Street by projecting a 66% jump in capital expenditures for 2022.</p><p>Arista's analyst meeting also came right after a strong third-quarter report. Revenue jumped 21% year over year to about $749 million, surpassing Wall Street's projections despite constraints caused by the chip shortage and other supply-chain woes. The company also managed to maintain its operating margins at 31% despite what Chief Executive Officer Jayshree Ullal described as \"very high escalating costs\" associated with the aforementioned constraints. Arista's share price jumped 25% in early trading Tuesday.</p><p>Those shortages are a mixed blessing for Arista. Ms. Ullal says the company has had to double its purchase commitments to its suppliers to beyond $2 billion. At the same time, Arista's own customers are locking in their orders early as well, by a year or more compared with the historical norm of one-to-two quarters out. \"Our visibility on 2022 is great, which is why we've given you some very aggressive growth numbers,\" Ms. Ullal said at Monday's meeting.</p><p>Arista has long been strong in the massive data centers built by tech giants such as Facebook's parent and by Microsoft, its largest customer. But that spending has historically been lumpy, and the easing of component shortages expected sometime next year could cause Arista to revert to a less predictable pattern. Revenue slipped 4% last year after averaging 30% growth over the previous three years. The company gave a long-term forecast Monday that suggested annual growth would cool to an average of 10% for the years 2023-25.</p><p>That could end up being conservative. Microsoft still will be competing hard against Amazon and Google for cloud supremacy by then. Blowout spending by Facebook's parent seems unlikely to cool much either. Mr. Zuckerberg said last week that the company's investments in augmented and virtual-reality technology will reduce its operating profit by $10 billion this year, \"and I expect this investment to grow even further for each of the next several years.\"</p><p>Arista will be happy to supply the dream.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Arista's Meta Boom Will Be Real Enough</p>",
