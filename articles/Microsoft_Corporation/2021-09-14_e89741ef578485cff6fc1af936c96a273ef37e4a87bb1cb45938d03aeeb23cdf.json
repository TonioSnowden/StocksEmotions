  "title": "U.S. News:  Gates Says  World Isn't  Ready for  Pandemics  ----  By Betsy McKay",
  "text": "<p>    Bill Gates warned six years ago that the biggest potential killer the world faced was a pandemic. </p><p>   Now, he says, not enough is being done to prepare for the next one. </p><p>   \"I'm a little worried that the attention to pandemic preparedness is lower than I would have expected,\" the billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft Corp. co-founder said in an interview. He said that proper preparedness included the ability to make a vaccine in 100 days and manufacture enough for the entire world in the next 100 days after that. </p><p>   The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation called in a report published Monday for nations to invest more in health systems, including the capacity to manufacture vaccines. The tools to end the pandemic are largely the same as those used to fight other infectious diseases, the report said: widespread testing, treatment and immunization. </p><p>   Some 49 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine were administered in the first half of this year in Africa compared with 43 million in California, according to the report, highlighting inequity in vaccine availability between low-income and wealthy nations. </p><p>   \"The only real solution to this problem is to have factories that can make enough for the entire world in 100 days,\" said Mr. Gates. \"And that is doable.\" </p><p>   A new $65 billion plan by the Biden administration to strengthen pandemic preparedness is a step in the right direction, he said, but will have to be funded. \"We're going to have to keep pushing for that,\" said Mr. Gates, who is co-chairman of the foundation with his former wife, Melinda French Gates. </p><p>   Mr. Gates said he is as engaged in his work with the foundation as ever because of the pandemic and other pressing challenges. \"It's a very positive part of our life and back to being the primary focus of my work,\" said Mr. Gates, who also works on reducing climate change. </p><p>   The Gates Foundation's \"Goalkeepers\" report tracks progress toward sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. The report also looked at the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>   The pandemic resulted in 31.3 million more people ending 2020 in extreme poverty, the report found, and an economic recovery under way this year is leaving women behind. </p><p>   Women are expected to hold 13 million fewer jobs this year than they did in 2019, before the pandemic began, while employment among men is forecast to recover largely to pre-pandemic rates, according to the report. </p><p>   The pandemic didn't damage the global economy or some developmental measures as badly as the foundation anticipated. \"It wasn't the worst case, but it's still a huge setback,\" Mr. Gates said. </p><p></p>",
