  "title": "GameStop Shares Slump as Pandemic Forces Changes; CEO says retailer is working to become a 'customer-obsessed technology company'",
  "text": "<p>GameStop is working to transform its decades-old bricks-and-mortar business to become more technology-centricâ€”and to avoid the fate of retailers like Blockbuster and Borders. The company has been weathering a steep decline in foot traffic since the start of the pandemic, and more recently shortages of hot items like next-generation consoles from Sony Corp . and Microsoft Corp .</p><p>The company has also been grappling with long-term industry changes. People are increasingly downloading games over the internet and accessing them through subscription services such as Microsoft 's Xbox Game Pass. Also, software developers have been releasing more free-to-play games.</p><p>Chief Executive George Sherman said that after a difficult year GameStop was working to become a \"customer-obsessed technology company that delights gamers.\" He said the retailer plans to expand its product offerings in areas such as gaming computers, gaming TVs and mobile gaming, while reducing its dependence on the console-gaming market, as well as improving customer service and warehouse management.</p><p>\"We expect to accelerate these and other elements of our transformation while continuing to focus on allowing the company to build upon its progress and capitalize on the emerging console cycle,\" Mr. Sherman said in a conference call.</p><p>In its latest quarter, though, GameStop fell short of Wall Street forecasts on revenue and profit, and declined to give financial guidance for the current year. Shares fell more than 10% in after-hours trading. The stock closed Tuesday down 6.6% at $181.75.</p><p>The company's fourth-quarter profit nearly quadrupled from a year earlier to $80.5 million, or $1.19 a share, helped by an income-tax benefit. Sales in the quarter, which ended Jan. 30, fell 3% to $2.12 billion. GameStop noted that it had closed hundreds of stores over the past year and that e-commerce accounted for more than a third of its total business.</p><p>GameStop 's shares have had a roller-coaster run since the start of the year, fueled by retail investors who embraced companies championed in online forums like WallStreetBets. The January run-up in GameStop 's share price led to losses among hedge funds and other investors who placed heavy bets against the company's stock performance. But the support was also driven by people who believe that the recent addition of Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen to the GameStop board could lead to a much-needed business overhaul.</p><p>Mr. Cohen, who took a stake in GameStop last year, and two other former Chewy executives joined the retailer's board in January as part of an agreement that called for at least four current directors to leave the panel later this year. GameStop also hired its first chief technology officer as well as a senior vice president of customer care. The company subsequently ousted its finance chief  and on Tuesday said that Frank Hamlin , its chief customer officer, would soon be stepping down.</p><p>GameStop 's stock closed 2020 at just below $19 a share. It peaked at $483 in intraday trading Jan. 28 only to trade just below $39 about three weeks later.</p><p>On Tuesday GameStop officials didn't address the stock-trading frenzy and the onslaught of attention from investors as well as regulators. Mr. Sherman was the only company executive to speak on the conference call and didn't take questions from analysts.</p><p>In addition to the hiring of Ms. Owens as operating chief, GameStop reported two other executive recruits. Neda Pacifico, previously vice president of e-commerce at Chewy, will become senior vice president of e-commerce, and Ken Suzuki , previously as vice president of supply-chain technology at online retailer Zulily , will become president of supply-chain systems.</p><p>GameStop also said in a securities filing that it may sell shares this year to help fund its transformation, among other needs. The company said the time and amount of shares sold would depend on multiple factors, including market perceptions of the company.</p><p>Write to Sarah E.
