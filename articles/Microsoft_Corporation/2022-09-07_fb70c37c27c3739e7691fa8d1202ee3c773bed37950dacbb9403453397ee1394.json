  "title": "India's Silicon Valley Flooded by Rains, Exposing Infrastructure Woes; Heavy rains lead to five-hour commutes in Bangalore, whose southeastern suburbs are home to large U.S. companies",
  "text": "<p>Though flooding is limited to a small portion of the city's total area, the most severely affected part happens to include southeastern suburbs that have developed in recent years as a major tech hub, home to the offices of U.S. companies such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Microsoft Corp., Dell Technologies Inc., and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., as well as prominent Indian tech startups, according to company websites.</p><p>The Outer Ring Road Companies Association, an industry body representing companies in the area, estimates that firms based along the corridor in that part of the city employ some half a million professionals. In a letter to the state's chief minister, the association put the productivity losses from a single day last week—when commutes stretched up to five hours—at nearly $30 million dollars, and said the city's infrastructure issues had \"reached a crisis level.\"</p><p>\"Even though only 30% of ORR population has returned to working from office, the collapse of the infrastructure has drawn global concern on the city of Bengaluru's ability to handle future growth,\" the association said, using another name for Bangalore.</p><p>One meme making the rounds on Indian social media jokes that tech workers are taking several hours to get to offices to develop apps that promise to deliver in 15 minutes.</p><p>Many companies shifted back to work-from-home routines, but residences weren't unscathed. Videos shared on social media showed upscale villas surrounded by high water. One CEO of an educational tech firm was evacuated from his apartment building, along with his pet dog, by tractor. In some areas the water supply was disrupted, and boats were deployed to get essential supplies and to evacuate residents.</p><p>With a lull in rainfall on Tuesday, the city is working on draining the area, but it is expected to take two days, Mr. Nath, the municipal commissioner, told The Wall Street Journal—provided it doesn't rain further.</p><p>Bangalore is one of many cities to have seen a spate of heavier than expected downpours in recent years. In July, the Pakistani city of Karachi saw more than five times as much rain as normal and experienced 16 days of rain compared with about 4 days typically, official data showed. The country as a whole has been racked by its worst floods in more than a decade, leaving more than 1,300 dead, a disaster that leaders and U.N. officials have linked to climate change.</p><p>In the case of Bangalore, too, some politicians and officials suggest climate change could be a factor. Urban experts say the city's problems are largely due to unchecked growth from its expansion as a tech hub.</p><p>Bangalore was known as a city of lakes for its network of interconnecting, largely man-made bodies of water. Until about the early 1970s, some 280 of these artificial lakes allowed for the transfer of excess rain during heavy rainfall, but by 2016 their number was down to 194 as the city's area and population expanded, according to a 2017 study by a group of scientists at the Center for Ecological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. Construction of roads, buildings and other infrastructure increasingly obstructed the drains and canals that connected the lakes, leading many bodies of water to be declared \"dead lakes\" that the civic authorities cleared for industrial development, the study said.</p><p>That has contributed to more frequent flooding, even during normal rainfall, urban researchers and environmental scientists have said.</p><p>While earlier waves of development of Bangalore, which is located on the Deccan plateau, roughly 3,000 feet above sea level, took place in more elevated parts of the city, more recent waves of development have happened in lower-lying areas.</p><p>The completion of the Outer Ring Road in the early 2000s pulled a lot of newer infrastructure toward one such area, its southeastern stretch, which connects with a highway leading to the city's airport, said Teja Malladi, a consultant at the Bangalore-based Indian Institute for Human Settlements who focuses on disaster risk and geographic data analysis.</p><p>\"The promise of seamless transport, no signals, and reaching office from any part of the city drew infrastructure to these big spaces,\" said Mr. Malladi. As a result many major IT parks are located near what were formerly important drainage networks for the city, he said.</p><p>Mr. Nath, the municipal commissioner, says the peripheral road follows the natural contours of the city, and the southeastern part of the ring happened to be in a lower-lying area.</p><p>\"All designs are made with some flows in mind,\" he said, noting that once rainfall is very high, \"it will overflow.\" He said that there have been planning violations around storm water drains.</p><p>\"They have happened more in those areas which developed in the later phase of the city which is catering to the growth of the city,\" he said, adding that plans are under way to spend $1 billion on infrastructure projects, including flood protection.</p><p>The infrastructure problems of Bangalore could direct some tech firms to look at other cities for their base of operations, the Outer Ring Road industry group has warned. Already many U.S. tech firms are setting up in the nearby southern city of Hyderabad, an up-and-coming rival tech hub where Amazon.com has its largest global office, while Google is building a large campus there too.</p><p>That city saw its own flash floods in 2020. The urban development minister for Telangana, the state where Hyderabad is located, said India's poor urban management means no city should consider itself immune to the situation Bangalore is currently facing.</p><p>\"Our cities are our primary economic engines,\" said Telangana's K.T. Rama Rao on his Twitter account on Monday. \"If India has to continue to grow, we need…radical improvement in infrastructure.\"</p><p>Write to Tripti Lahiri at tripti.lahiri@wsj.com and Krishna Pokharel at krishna.pokharel@wsj.com</p><p>India's Silicon Valley Flooded by Rains, Exposing Infrastructure Woes</p>",
