  "text": "<p>   PHILADELPHIA -- President Biden warned that former President Donald Trump and his allies are threatening to undermine the nation's democracy, using a prime-time address to lay out his concerns for the country's future when millions of Americans have questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. </p><p>   Standing in front of Philadelphia's Independence Hall, Mr. Biden directly condemned what he called \"MAGA Republicans,\" citing the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, saying, \"As I stand here tonight, equality and democracy are under assault.\" </p><p>   The speech Thursday night came just before the traditional Labor Day start of the midterm election campaign season. </p><p>   \"Too much of what's happening in our country today is not normal. Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic,\" Mr. Biden said. </p><p>   Mr. Biden sought to draw a distinction between Republicans allied with Mr. Trump and others in the party. He called people from all parties to \"unite behind the single purpose of defending our democracy regardless of your ideology.\" </p><p>   Mr. Trump said on his social-media network: \"Someone should explain to Joe Biden, slowly but passionately, that MAGA means, as powerfully as mere words can get, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! If he doesn't want to Make America Great Again, which through words, action, and thought, he doesn't, then he certainly should not be representing the United States of America!\" </p><p>   During Mr. Biden's speech, the voices of demonstrators shouting into bullhorns in opposition to his remarks could be heard from nearby streets. </p><p>   The Republican National Committee said in a statement that Mr. Biden was \"the divider-in-chief and epitomizes the current state of the Democrat Party: one of divisiveness, disgust, and hostility towards half the country.\" </p><p>   Democrats hold narrow majorities in both the House and Senate, and Mr. Biden is seeking to turn the elections into a choice for voters between his party and that of Republicans, who have criticized his leadership and have said Democrats are trying to distract from the more central issues of inflation and economic unrest. </p><p>   The speech is one of three visits Mr. Biden is making to Pennsylvania, a top battleground state with closely watched races for governor and the Senate, in the course of a week. Mr. Trump is scheduled to hold a rally in the state for GOP candidates Saturday. </p><p>   Mr. Biden and White House officials have been more direct in recent weeks in criticizing what they have called \"ultra-MAGA\" Republicans, referring to Mr. Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" campaign slogan, and the spreading of false claims about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. </p><p>   During a Maryland fundraiser last week, Mr. Biden described Mr. Trump and his allies' approach to governing as \"like semi-fascism.\" </p><p>   A Quinnipiac University poll released this week found identical shares of Republicans and Democrats -- 69% on each side -- said they believed \"the nation's democracy is in danger of collapse,\" though likely for very different reasons. Other surveys have shown declining faith among Republicans in the electoral system. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Alex Leary contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
