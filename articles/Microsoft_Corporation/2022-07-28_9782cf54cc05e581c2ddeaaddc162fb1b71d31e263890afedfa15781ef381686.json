  "title": "China Pressures Cities as They Scramble to Repair Ailing Property Markets; Local governments have tried to entice home buyers with tax rebates, cash rewards and lower down payments, but to little avail",
  "text": "<p>On Thursday, the Politburo, China's top policy-making body, pledged to stabilize the property market and said it would work to resolve problems in the rural banking system but it said local governments should take direct responsibility for delivering unfinished homes and supporting demand for housing.</p><p>Chinese leaders signaled no deviation from their broader goal of reining in the excessive debts of the country's property developers and reaffirmed its mantra that \"houses are for living in, not for speculating on.\"</p><p>Along with its strict zero-Covid policies, China's slowing property market has been one of the biggest problems for its struggling economy, which grew at only 0.4% in the most recent quarter year over year. Home sales slumped again this month as developers struggled to finish homes and home buyer confidence remained weak. China's 5.5% GDP target for the year is its lowest in a quarter century, and some economists wonder if China will grow at all this year.</p><p>Stabilizing the property market \"will be no easy task given the recent deterioration in home buyer sentiment and the large funding shortfalls among developers,\" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics.</p><p>Local governments have rolled out a flurry of incentives in recent weeks to boost their property markets, including tax rebates, cash rewards and lower down payments.</p><p>Zhangshu, a city of roughly 500,000 people in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangxi, is offering the equivalent of about $150 to property brokers who can make a sale. Guyuan, a city of 1.5 million in China's northwest, has offered to subsidize 1% of purchases for first-time home buyers. In Chizhou, in China's rural interior, potential home buyers can attend a government-run real estate fair, buy a home, receive 3,000 yuan of subsidy worth about $450, have their down payment reduced to 20% from 30% and have some of their property management fees waived.</p><p>At least a dozen other cities have allowed prospective home buyers to share mortgage payment obligations with parents and other family members.</p><p>Nearly 170 cities across the country have rolled out a collective 325 policies to lower barriers to home buying, according to Zhuge.com, a Chinese property search engine. In July alone, nearly 70 cities have issued policies to stabilize their local housing market, according to state media reports.</p><p>City governments have jumped in to try to stem the downward spiral in home buyers' sentiment as some of China's property developers struggle to finish projects after Beijing put rules in place to prevent excessive borrowing. Many homeowners are now threatening to stop paying for unfinished properties.</p><p>The revolt has left local authorities scrambling to reassure home buyers that projects will be completed. Authorities in Zhengzhou, in central China's Henan province, said on Wednesday that the city will take over troubled projects from seven major developers, state media reported. Taiyuan, a city in northern Shanxi province, pledged that all presold apartments would be completed in 24 months.</p><p>But the measures by local governments have failed to dispel the gloom hanging over the market. A small rebound in home sales in June was quickly reversed by a slowdown in July as a combination of harsh pandemic-related lockdowns in some cities and the widening mortgage strike hit sentiment. Sales by volume in 30 large and medium-sized Chinese cities registered notable declines this month, according to a report published Tuesday by China Real Estate Information Corp., a Shanghai-based property research firm.</p><p>\"This is the first time in decades that the housing market didn't respond much to the easing. I think we are still in a vicious cycle of declining home sales, declining land acquisition and then declining real-estate investments,\" said Dongming Xie, head of Greater China research and strategy at OCBC Bank.</p><p>The mortgage revolt began in mid-July and has quickly spread to roughly 320 unfinished housing projects across the country, according to a tally of statements from homeowners saying they will stop paying their mortgages circulating on GitHub, a Microsoft Corp.-owned coding-collaboration site. Unlike the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis in 2008, a precedent that some market watchers have invoked, Chinese home buyers in this case have the ability to repay mortgages—they simply don't want to, says Mr. Xie of OCBC.</p><p>\"They are turning this mortgage boycott into a tool to pressure local governments and safeguard consumer rights,\" he said.</p><p>One home buyer in the central Chinese city of Wuhan who bought an unfinished apartment two years ago said halting her mortgage payments was a final attempt to pressure her developer to finish the property, and the local government to step in and do something. The woman, who asked to be identified only by her surname, Wang, said she was so frustrated she was willing to sacrifice her credit rating to get something done. \"I don't care about it any more,\" she said.</p><p>Ms. Wang said buying the apartment was one of her life's biggest regrets. Ms. Wang, together with dozens of home buyers in the same community, had displayed a banner in front of the unfinished construction site in March but didn't get anywhere with the developer or the local government.</p><p>Ms. Wang, who had borrowed from friends and relatives to purchase the property, said the Wuhan government had offered pleasant-sounding words to home buyers on several occasions, saying that they were working to fix the problem. \"I don't know what they actually did,\" she said. \"I didn't see any changes.\"</p><p>The root issue hitting sentiment is doubt among home buyers that the properties they purchased will ever be completed—and, if so, whether the investments will rise in value over the long term, according to the CRIC report.</p><p>Tommy Wu, a Hong Kong-based economist for Oxford Economics, says Chinese officials should make it a priority to ensure that funding is being channeled to unfinished projects so that they can be completed. Concrete schedules and timelines would go a long way toward increasing transparency and boosting confidence, he added.</p><p>A government-backed bailout fund for developers, if realized, could help some home buyers get what they paid for, but it likely wouldn't be enough to rescue the sector more broadly, said Li Yujia, chief researcher with the Policy Researcher Center under the Guangdong Urban and Rural Planning and Design Institute, a policy advisory body linked to the local government.</p><p>\"The so-called bailout will only focus on protecting home buyers and ensuring social stability,\" Mr. Li said. Developers would likely be an afterthought, he added—meaning that the broader pain for a property sector that by some measures accounts for up to one-third of the Chinese economy could face a rocky road ahead.</p><p>What is needed now is better coordination between different authorities and local governments, said Mr. Wu of Oxford Economics. The central government is only sending signals, rather than clear instructions, because, traditionally, local governments have had greater autonomy in setting their real-estate policies in accordance with their own situations, he said.</p><p>Keith Zhai contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Rebecca Feng at rebecca.feng@wsj.com and Cao Li at li.cao@wsj.com</p><p>China Pressures Cities as They Scramble to Repair Ailing Property Markets</p>",
