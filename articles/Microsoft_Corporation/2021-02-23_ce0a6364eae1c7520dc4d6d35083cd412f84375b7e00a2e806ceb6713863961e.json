Only, as part of a separate <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/opioid-manufacturer-purdue-pharma-pleads-guilty-fraud-and-kickback-conspiracies\">settlement</a> with the <strong>US Department of Justice</strong>, McKinsey's client pleaded guilty to extensive criminal wrongdoing.</p> <p>The debacle is the <em>pièce de résistance</em> in a collection of scandals inherited by McKinsey's global managing partner <strong>Kevin Sneader </strong>since he entered the top job in 2018.</p> <p>Purdue agreed last October to pay more than $8bn in a criminal and civil settlement with the DoJ.</p> <p>He has navigated reputational landmines across <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d5fa556-d523-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8\">Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2db2a6d-693a-49e4-87e2-194183e6445b\">South Africa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6110fe11-98e4-42ec-9522-f86d0a458ea2\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/business/france-mckinsey-consultants-covid-vaccine.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes\">France</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/653367d3-b2c2-4dd0-b046-4115ea5f7e56\">within its own ranks</a>, while vowing to be<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/op-ed-the-mckinsey-i-hope-the-world-gets-to-know.html\"> more selective</a> about how the firm chooses its next generation of clients.</p> <p>We are about to find out how his colleagues think he has handled this laundry list of PR crises, as the FT revealed on Monday that McKinsey's 650 senior partners have<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f001f3ef-e296-4eb6-b711-5f7cb773e314\"> begun voting</a> on whether Sneader should serve a second term.</p> <p>The triennial process, which has already selected 10 potential candidates and could narrow the list to two finalists as soon as this week, is both routine and being seen as a referendum on the 54-year-old Scot's response to McKinsey's recent travails.</p> <p>Insiders told the FT it would be unusual for Sneader not to be re-elected, as his five predecessors were. But a new generation at McKinsey has the potential to tip the scale.</p> <p>To take a page from Darwin, not to mention “Evolve 2 Excellence”, it's survival of the fittest out there.</p> <p><strong>Required reading</strong>: don't miss<a href=\"https://ft.com/content/63f24181-aee0-49f4-9966-a447d79692f0?\"> this just published McKinsey deep-dive</a> by the FT's Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, Andrew Hill and Hannah Kuchler for a closer look into one of the world's most powerful companies.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h2>The private jet deal that lets everybody win</h2> <p>The last time DD checked in on <strong>Signature Aviation</strong>, a FTSE 250-listed company that provides refuelling and maintenance services for private jets, battle lines were being drawn.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Global Infrastructure Partners</strong>, the New York-based group founded by former <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> banker <strong>Adebayo Ogunlesi</strong>, had made a £3.4bn bid that trumped an offer from <strong>Blackstone</strong> and <strong>Cascade</strong>, which manages <strong>Bill Gates</strong>' fortune.</p> <p>But Signature's chair <strong>Sir Nigel Rudd</strong> was essentially encouraging rival bidders to get back into the race, and chess-like calculations were being made about how a protracted public wrangle might play out.&#xa0;</p> <p>Fast-forward a few weeks and the rivals are friends. Blackstone, Cascade and GIP joined forces in a fresh £3.5bn bid this month (catch up <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2dd2620-095d-4747-bd4c-b4d387b67614\">here</a>).&#xa0;</p> <p>If it goes through, it will let Rudd “preserve in formaldehyde” his reputation for dealing with private equity groups, one adviser told DD (Rudd chaired Boots when it agreed a £11bn take-private deal with <strong>KKR </strong>in 2007).</p> <p>The other big winners that emerge from the plan: the deal's professional advisers. Take a look at these fees, <a href=\"https://www.signatureaviation.com/~/media/Files/S/Signature-Aviation/documents/22-Feb-microsite/Scheme-Document.pdf\">from documents published on Monday</a>. This is for the buyers, whose advisers include <strong>UBS</strong>, <strong>Gleacher Shacklock</strong>,<strong> RBC</strong>, <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> and<strong> Linklaters</strong> . . . </p> <p><br>. . . and this, for the sellers, whose advisers include <strong>JPMorgan</strong>, <strong>Jefferies</strong> and <strong>Slaughter and May</strong>. Signature is set to spend a cool million dollars on PR advice, which <strong>Tulchan Communications </strong>is in charge of, if the deal materialises:&#xa0;</p> <p>So far, it's a long way from the $1.1bn in fees racked up by the<strong> London Stock Exchange Group</strong>'s takeover of data provider<strong> Refinitiv</strong> — one of the biggest paydays for a UK acquisition.&#xa0;</p> <p>But, for a few people, it might just bring private jet travel a little closer within reach.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Stephan Crétier strikes out</h2> <p>According to people around him, <strong>Stephan Crétier</strong> is a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7cdc09eb-7f29-462d-8fb7-fa0832ebfccf\">hard-charging dealmaker</a> who doesn't give up easily.</p> <p>But the baseball-loving chief executive of <strong>GardaWorld</strong>, a Montreal-based security company backed by the private equity group <strong>BC Partners</strong>, may have to walk away from his biggest gambit yet.</p> <p>GardaWorld <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5559c3de-cb0e-4ad7-9598-66d3b376470e\">said on Monday</a> that it won't raise its £3.7bn hostile bid for UK-listed <strong>G4S</strong>, the world's biggest security company. Its 235p-a-share offer is trumped by a friendly 245p bid by its US-based rival <strong>Allied Universal</strong> that already has the support of the company's board.&#xa0;</p> <p>Crétier went public with a hostile approach in September, calling the company “deeply troubled,” describing his approach as a “rescue bid” and saying its senior management had failed to deliver. G4S had privately rebuffed him twice in the months leading up to that.&#xa0;</p> <p>By scorching the earth beneath him, he led G4S executives — in search of alternative options — to talk seriously with Allied.&#xa0;</p> <p>Though Crétier said in December that he was weighing a higher bid, it never materialised. The obvious explanation is that he couldn't participate in an auction his backers didn't want to win, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7add7a7a-959f-4f24-975d-a4d514d43922\">writes</a> Bryce Elder in the FT's Lombard column.</p> <p>If the Allied bid goes through, he will have paved the way for a good deal for G4S shareholders — and a huge expansion by a rival group.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <p><strong>Roberto Castello Branco </strong>is set to be replaced as head of Brazilian oil producer<strong> Petrobras </strong>after being publicly criticised by the country's president <strong>Jair Bolsonaro </strong>over recent increases in the price of petrol and diesel.

He will be replaced by chief compliance officer <strong>Colin Bell</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>Chief executive of the bank's US division <strong>Michael Roberts </strong>will expand his responsibilities to become chief executive of the US, Canada and Latin America.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Stephen Moss</strong> will move from London where he worked as a regional chief executive to Dubai to run the bank's Middle East, north Africa and Turkey business.</p></li> </ul> <p>Former <strong>Bank of England </strong>governor <strong>Mark Carney</strong> has joined the board of online payments provider <strong>Stripe</strong>.

He was previously deputy head of Chinese equity capital markets at<strong> Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer</strong>.</p> <p><strong>King &amp; Spalding </strong>has hired<strong> Russell Sacks</strong> as a partner in its corporate finance practice. He joins the New York office from <strong>Shearman &amp; Sterling</strong>.</p> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Once upon a time in Bollywood </strong>The show must go on in India, where insatiable streaming demand beckons film crews and fresh talent from lockdown. Shibasish Sarkar, head of the country's leading studio Reliance Entertainment, has a plan to take Indian content to the global stage.
