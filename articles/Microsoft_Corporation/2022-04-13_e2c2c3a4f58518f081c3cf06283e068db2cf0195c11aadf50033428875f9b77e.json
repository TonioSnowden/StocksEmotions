  "text": "<p>With the likelihood of the pandemic to be around for years, Zoom is in the midst of a “transitional period for all employees and us as a company,” Steckelberg told MarketWatch in a — what else? — Zoom conference call. “Our platform is evolving into a new work-from-home reality.”</p><p>“Employees want flexibility and they want choice,” Steckelberg said. “Companies also needs to empower them at same time, if they are out of office a day or two a week.”</p><p>The company has evolved its app to include Zoom Phone and Zoom Events, for example, as it competes with Cisco Systems Inc.'s CSCO WebEx and Microsoft Corp.'s MSFT Teams for millions of Americans splitting work between home and the office.
