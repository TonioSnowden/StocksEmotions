  "title": "Ohio Files Suit Seeking to Label Google a Public Utility",
  "text": "<p>Amid the array of court challenges, Ohio said that it is the first state in the country to bring a lawsuit seeking a court declaration that Google is a common carrier subject under state law to government regulation. The lawsuit, which doesn't seek monetary damages, says Google has a duty to provide the same rights for advertisements and product placement for competitors as it provides for its own services.</p><p>\"When you own the railroad or the electric company or the cellphone tower, you have to treat everyone the same and give everybody access,\" said Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a Republican.</p><p>A Google spokesman said the remedies sought in the Ohio lawsuit would worsen the company's search results and impair businesses' ability to connect directly with customers. \"Ohioans simply don't want the government to run Google like a gas or electric company,\" a spokesman said. \"This lawsuit has no basis in fact or law and we'll defend ourselves against it in court.\"</p><p>In a statement alongside a Supreme Court order in April, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested that he believed regulating tech platforms as utilities had merit.</p><p>That case involved former President Donald Trump's practice in office of blocking certain individuals from following his Twitter account. The court dismissed the case as moot, given that Mr. Trump was no longer in office, but Justice Thomas suggested that social-media networks such as Twitter, Google and other tech companies could be regulated to limit their power over who speaks and what is said over their platforms.</p><p>The Ohio case, however, isn't focused on speech but rather on Google's tendency to surface search results that direct users to its own products rather than rival services.</p><p>Google has a 91% share of search world-wide, according to StatCounter, a web analytics firm. Google's decades-old lead in search has helped it amass queries that allow it to improve its service and make it difficult for rivals' offerings -- Microsoft Corp.'s Bing or DuckDuckGo -- to compete.</p><p>For example, the search engine has appeared to surface videos from its online-video service, YouTube, over similar clips from Facebook Inc. The company also has faced allegations that it lifts content such as song lyrics and weather from other websites and features it as an answer to queries in so-called knowledge boxes rather than directing users to sites that are the source. Google has said that it doesn't give preference to YouTube and that it doesn't scrape other sites for useful information.</p><p>In 2020, two-thirds of Google searches ended without a click, according to analysis by SimilarWeb. SparkToro CEO Rand Fishkin, who worked with SimilarWeb on its research, said that practice keeps users on Google's site, depriving other sites of traffic. Google calls that study flawed.</p>",
