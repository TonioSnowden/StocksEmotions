  "text": "<p>Wise will debut on the London Stock Exchange after the fintech start-up completed its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/0658d2fb-593f-486d-bc95-0036640f68da\">landmark direct listing</a>.</p> <p>Wise, formerly known as TransferWise, chose the unusual route of joining the LSE without selling any new shares. It is the first technology company to complete a direct listing in the UK. </p> <p>The currency transfer specialist, which was valued at $5bn in a secondary share sale last year, said its float offers “a fairer, cheaper and more transparent way for us to broaden our ownership”. A&#xa0;dual-class share structure will restrict the stock to a standard listing and exclude it from FTSE indices.</p> <p>Its class A shares are due to be priced at around 11am. Wise founders and pre-float backers retain about 399m non-transferable class B shares that carry nine votes apiece, versus nearly 995m class A shares, which on admission gives them more than 90 per cent of the voting rights. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Engineer <strong>Renishaw</strong> said it has scrapped plans to sell itself. “The board carefully reviewed a number of proposals with its advisers and unanimously concluded that none would meet the board's objectives of delivering an outcome that satisfactorily met the interests of all stakeholders,” said the company, which had begun a formal sale process in March. Co-founders David McMurty and John Deer remain committed to Renishaw and have no intention of selling their shares for the foreseeable future, Renishaw added. In an accompanying trading statement, Renishaw raised revenue and profit guidance for the year ended June.</p> <p><strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> revealed plans to boost shareholder returns after higher oil and gas prices allowed it to accelerate debt repayments. In a trading statement, Shell said it would target share buybacks or dividends in the range of 20 to 30 per cent of cash flow from operations. The company added that it would “retire” its previous target of higher returns once net debt fell below $65bn.</p> <p>Housebuilder <strong>Redrow</strong> said sales have remained strong since its last update in February. Better than expected turnover from its regional business and the ahead of schedule completion of a London private rented sector scheme means turnover for the year ended June will now be up 44 per cent year on year at around £1.94bn, Redrow said. For the 2022 financial year Redrow targeted turnover of more than £2bn.</p> <p>Fellow housebuilder <strong>Vistry</strong> said it was confident of delivering consensus expectations for 2021 and 2022 after first-half trading beat expectations. </p> <p><strong>JD Wetherspoon</strong> said it will seek debt waivers following a deterioration in recent trading. Like-for-like sales slumped 20.8 per cent during the Euro 2020 tournament, which save for a few one-off exceptions has not been shown in its pubs. For the three week period ahead of the tournament like-or-like sales were down 8.1 per cent, it reported. </p> <p>Staffing agency <strong>PageGroup</strong> said second quarter gross profit nearly doubled to £219.7m and exceeded pre-pandemic levels by 2 per cent. An uptick in hiring across Asia Pacific and the Americas meant Page was able to raise its guidance for annual operating profit to between £125m and £135m.</p> <p><strong>888</strong>, the online casino operator, posted revenue up 10 per cent year on year at $257m for the second quarter. Growth was “slightly ahead of board expectations” and was driven by regulated and taxed markets, which contributed 74 per cent of revenue, the company said.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Redde Northgate</strong>, the van rental and courtesy car management group, said its performance for the year ended April had beaten the board's expectations and that for the new year strong momentum had continued. Its annual underlying pre-tax profit jumped 58 per cent to £93.2m on revenue up 50.2 per cent to £879.7m. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>The Pentagon has cancelled the highly sensitive $10bn <strong>Jedi cloud computing contract</strong> that had been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ac0e691-665f-4328-8b29-ee4883068e80\">awarded to Microsoft</a>, reversing its decision to hand over large parts of its data and communications to a single company. The department said it would instead seek proposals for a new&#xa0;cloud computing&#xa0;contract from both Microsoft and Amazon.</p> <p><strong>Didi</strong>&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/095eb7ac-09ea-4a5c-8253-d8ca2d945614\">lost one-fifth of its market value</a>&#xa0;after Chinese regulators announced an investigation into the ride-hailing app. China sparked investor unease before the start of trading when it said it would tighten restrictions on overseas listings of companies that held sensitive data.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0b77371-fdd3-4650-81e7-9b5e51f27bb9?emailId=60e52950a16c3d00043209ab&amp;segmentId=22011ee7-896a-8c4c-22a0-7603348b7f22\">Saudi-Emirati clash</a> has opened a rift at the heart of <strong>Opec</strong> that threatens the ability of the cartel, and its partners in the Opec+ alliance, to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17acce16-ae2c-4886-9853-2f579d81d3be\">deliver oil market stability</a> and could yet see the United Arab Emirates, a member since 1967, leave the group.</p> <p><strong>Nomura</strong> will stop offering cash prime-brokerage services in the US and Europe, and has given some clients about six months to find a new provider,&#xa0;people familiar with the matter <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/nomura-axes-cash-prime-brokerage-in-u-s-europe-after-archegos\">told Bloomberg</a>. The pullback by Japan's biggest brokerage comes after it took a $2.9bn hit from the implosion of hedge fund Archegos Capital Management.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>The world needs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1df553f-524d-4119-a7e1-07d6c3852fc2\">better, more consistent reporting standards</a> around sustainability. But that's no reason to luxuriate in the status quo while those are developed. The impact of climate change should already be evident in company accounts.</p> <p><strong>Lena Komileva</strong> <br>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e79c894e-8e89-44c6-a864-c6a2cc70bbb0\">economic effects of Covid</a> do not end with the supply-demand imbalances. The pandemic has accelerated structural changes to business models, consumption patterns, labour dynamics and public sector balance sheets. There will not be a return to normal.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Fintech start-up Wise set to begin trading after landmark listing' FT.com 7 July.
