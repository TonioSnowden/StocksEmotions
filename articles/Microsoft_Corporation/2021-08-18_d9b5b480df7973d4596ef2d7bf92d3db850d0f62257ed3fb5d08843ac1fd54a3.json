  "title": "S&P 500 still near ‘parity' after record run, says behavior-based market tool",
  "text": "<p>Gorzycki and Kashyap, the co-founders of Kievanos LLC, a predictive-analytics company, began developing the online platform around five years ago, building on an interest in behavioral economics. As they describe it, the system consumes a variety of publicly available and non-personally identifiable data around an asset, which is then used to generate distributions that are used to identify propensities toward an array of cognitive biases.</p><p>The presence or absence of those biases are variables in a model that produces a “discrete, directional probability” of where the asset is headed. This is charted as an oscillator, with low values corresponding to “fearful” markets and higher values corresponding to overly “greedy” markets.</p><p>The platform tracks each asset to identify correlations between what's seen in the behavioral model and what's happpening in the market. That's displayed in a heat map, with red zones indicating price pullbacks alongside corroborating behavioral data, and blue zones that represent run-ups.</p><p>Currently operating as a free pilot program with around 4,000 to 5,000 users, Kashyap and Gorzycki aim to move OVTLYR to a “freemium” model by early next year.</p><p>A reading of 50% is considered “neutral.” As for SPY, it was displaying readings Tuesday of 55% and 56% on an even- and cap-weighted basis, respectively (see chart below).</p><p>OVTLYR“These values are very slight in terms of an indicator; however, taking recent data/values into consideration, we appear to be moving further into the ‘greed' direction, at which point the contrarian indication (bearish) would grow stronger,” Gorzycki said.</p><p>The oscillators don't flip on a dime. Gorzycki and Kashyap said traders shouldn't view them as outright buy or sell signals, but as a tool similar to traditional technical or price indicators. However, they said they plan to release a model portfolio solution in coming weeks that would be capable of automating allocations toward selected assets.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX and Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA closed at records on Monday — the fifth straight for both. Stocks were pulling back sharply Tuesday, but remain up solidly for the month and year-to-date. Through Monday, the S&amp;P 500 had risen 100.2% from its pandemic low set on March 23, 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>The “wisdom of crowds”, a surprising phenomenon in which crowdsourcing answers questions, such as how many marbles are in a jar, has proved surprisingly accurate in experiments, though it is not foolproof. The concept was popularized by financial journalist James Surowiecki's 2004 book of the same name, the title a reference to Charles's MacKay's “Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds,” published in 1841.</p><p>That madness is still often on display in herd-like behavior that drives asset prices to extremes.</p><p>See:GameStop saga illustrates rising ‘noise-trader risk' that could feed market volatility, warns quantitative analyst</p><p>OVTLYR tracks more than 1,300 of the largest, most liquid assets on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Among the challenges was coming up with a system that worked across stocks. “It can't be something&#xa0;that works for Microsoft but doesn't work for Google,” Kashyap said.</p><p>The OVLTYR system, needless to say, likely isn't ideal for super-active day traders.</p><p>“A lot of these movements from the greed zone to the fear zone take a few weeks to a few months,” Kashyap said. “If you're looking to day trade, it may not be a good idea.”</p><p>Gorzycki said rehabilitated day traders might be the ideal users of the system, though it could benefit users “on both ends of the spectrum” from passive to active, he said.</p><p>“If we can pull someone away from the day-trading edge and say, look, you're hurting yourself on frequency, you're being highly speculative and it's damaging to your results…here are some ways you could perhaps be more targeted.”</p>",
