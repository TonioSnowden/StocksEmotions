  "title": "Pennsylvanians Rush to Correct Mail Ballots After Court Ruling; Some early voters forgot to date their mail-in ballots in the key Senate race",
  "text": "<p>Some Pennsylvania election officials on Tuesday sought to help voters correct mail-in ballots, after a ruling last week from the state's Supreme Court that could determine the outcome of a closely watched U.S. Senate race.</p><p>Election officials in Philadelphia County and Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, published online the names of about 4,000 residents whose mail-in ballots were at risk of being rejected after the Nov. 1 decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which said ballots with an incorrect or missing date on an exterior envelope shouldn't be counted.</p><p>John Fetterman, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in the state, filed a federal lawsuit on Monday arguing that excluding the ballots was unconstitutional.</p><p>Mr. Fetterman's race against Republican opponent Mehmet Oz is considered a tossup.</p><p>Almost five million people voted early in Pennsylvania, either in-person or by submitting a mail-in ballot, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida.</p><p>In Philadelphia, voters whose mail ballots were flagged as deficient lined up at city hall to request replacements. Kirby Smith, a registered Democrat, said he and his wife waited for more than two hours on Monday to cast replacement ballots, forcing them to take a day off from work.</p><p>\"It was very frustrating,\" said Mr. Smith, 59 years old, who added that he had been careful to date the exterior envelope on his original ballot but still ended up on the official list of people who cast flawed ballots.</p><p>Under Pennsylvania law, voters must fill out, date and sign a declaration printed on the official return envelope.</p><p>For years, judges have split on whether a ballot should be disqualified if it lacks a handwritten date on the exterior envelope. The date isn't used by election officials to verify voter eligibility. Such ballots were counted in the November 2020 presidential election, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court based that decision in part on the extraordinary circumstances created by the pandemic.</p><p>Pennsylvania's highest court on Nov. 1 ordered election officials to disqualify mail-in ballots if the exterior envelope is undated or incorrectly dated. The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by the Republican National Committee and other GOP groups.</p><p>Allegheny County reported about 1,000 ballots that will be affected by the ruling if not fixed, and Philadelphia County had more than 3,000.</p><p>By midafternoon, only a couple hundred Philadelphia voters had taken advantage of the opportunity to cure defective mail-in ballots, said Lisa Deeley, who chairs the Philadelphia City Commissioners, the three-member board that runs elections in the city.</p><p>But Ms. Deeley, a Democrat, said she had no way of knowing how many voters had opted to cast a provisional ballot at a polling place.</p><p>Nearly 100 election workers were processing mail-in ballots at a warehouse in northeast Philadelphia, Ms. Deeley said in an interview on the warehouse floor. She said the workers were opening, flattening and scanning about 100,000 mail-in ballots.</p><p>In addition, more than 3,000 ballots had been segregated without being counted, she said, because they were undated, misdated or lacked an inner secrecy envelope.</p><p>Mr. Fetterman's campaign, in the federal lawsuit filed on Monday, said the date requirement \"imposes unnecessary hurdles that eligible Pennsylvanians must clear to exercise their most fundamental right\" under the U.S. Constitution.</p><p>In Pennsylvania's Luzerne County, an area where voters have a history of swinging support between the two parties, a judge ordered polling locations to stay open two extra hours until 10 p.m. after a shortage of paper used in voting machines ground dozens of precincts to a halt during the afternoon.</p><p>Beth Gilbert McBride, the county's acting elections director, told local news station WBRE-TV that the shortage was \"inexcusable.\"</p><p>\"Long story short, each machine that was deployed to the polling locations should have been preloaded with the necessary amount of paper that is required throughout the day,\" Ms. McBride said. \"We are investigating why that didn't happen.\"</p><p>Voters also encountered issues in Arizona's Maricopa County, where tabulation machines in about 20% of the county's 223 voting centers are malfunctioning and not accepting some completed ballots as designed, county officials said Tuesday.</p><p>Bill Gates, chairman of the county board of supervisors, said about one in five ballots isn't being accepted by the malfunctioning machines. In those instances, he said, voters are being asked to deposit their completed ballot in a secure drop box on the tabulating machine. Mr. Gates said the secure drop box is a redundancy, should a tabulating machine malfunction.</p><p>\"Everyone is still getting to vote. No one is being disenfranchised,\" Mr. Gates said. \"This is a technical issue and we have a redundancy for it.\"</p><p>Ballots left in the drop box will be collected after polls close and will be taken to a central vote-counting center by a bipartisan team, Mr. Gates said.</p><p>Pahola Delgado, a 22-year-old cashier from Phoenix, said she spent more than an hour in the voting center because the vote-tabulating machine didn't accept her first ballot. After spoiling the first ballot, Ms. Delgado submitted a new ballot that was accepted. She said she still feels confident in the voting process.</p><p>\"I want every voter to know every eligible vote will be counted, whether it's at the polling place or whether it's transported securely back to headquarters and tabulated tonight,\" Secretary of State Katie Hobbs told The Wall Street Journal about the voting-machine issue. \"That's actually how most counties do their tabulation. And we have backups.\"</p><p>Ms. Hobbs is the Democratic candidate for governor and the state's chief elections administrator.</p><p>Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for governor, said, \"I'm just embarrassed for Arizona that we're still having these problems\" with voting-machine issues in the state's most populous county.</p><p>The former Phoenix television anchor has aligned herself closely with former President Donald Trump and his false claims of fraud in the 2020 election. Former Attorney General William Barr found there was no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, and the former president's attorneys lost scores of lawsuits claiming that there were irregularities in the vote.</p><p>Ms. Lake, at one point in the campaign, had only committed to accepting the results of this election if she wins. She told reporters Tuesday she wasn't suggesting the results of this election wouldn't be accurate: \"We're gonna see what happens.\"</p><p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has been in communication with state and local officials in Maricopa County and said there were no signs the problems in Arizona were caused by malicious activity or deliberate sabotage, a senior agency official told reporters Tuesday during a briefing.</p><p>The Justice Department said Monday that it would send monitors to 64 jurisdictions in 24 states, as it routinely does during election cycles to look out for legal violations, harassment and intimidation. Officials in Missouri and Florida have rejected the monitors, calling their presence inappropriate and unnecessary.</p><p>The Justice Department said it would station federal election observers outside polling places in those states after officials said they would block them from entering the facilities.</p><p>Sadie Gurman, Scott Calvert, Eliza Collins and Alicia Caldwell contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jan Wolfe at jan.wolfe@wsj.com</p><p>Pennsylvanians Rush to Correct Mail Ballots After Court Ruling</p>",
