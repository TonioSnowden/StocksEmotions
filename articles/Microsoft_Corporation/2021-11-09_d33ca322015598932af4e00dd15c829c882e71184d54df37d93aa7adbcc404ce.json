  "title": "Indonesia-Focused Alpha JWC Closes $433 Million Venture-Capital Fund; Tech investor's third raise is more than double its first two funds combined",
  "text": "<p>The fund, coming after a 2016 raise of $50 million and a 2018 fund that garnered more than $120 million, more than triples the firm's assets under management to about $630 million. The fund surpassed an initial target of $250 million to $300 million, with three-quarters of previous investors returning and the number of U.S. investors doubling from the second fundraising, Alpha JWC said.</p><p>The firm said its strategy to invest in early-stage tech companies, largely in Indonesia, would remain the same but that the bigger size of the new fund would give it a war chest to make investments of up to $60 million in multistage financing, far higher than its previous investments.</p><p>\"We believe that the larger fund size is the right thing for us when we compare that with the opportunity that we are seeing in the marketplace,\" said Jefrey Joe, co-founder of Alpha JWC. \"Usually we invest in six to eight companies a year. This yearâ€¦we are on track to invest in more than 15.\"</p><p>IFC said its participation underscored a long-term commitment to Indonesia's economic development and digital transformation. \"Alpha JWC's focus on innovative technology-enabled businesses is key, as these investments help enable long-term development and have the power to transform lives,\" said Kim-See Lim, a regional director for the body.</p><p>The fundraising comes at a time when fast-growing Southeast Asian tech disrupters are expanding their reach in capital markets.</p><p>Singapore-based ride-hailing and deliveries giant Grab Holdings Ltd. is slated to go public in the U.S. via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company that values the company at $40 billion, while Indonesia's top tech startups Gojek and Tokopedia recently merged in a multibillion-dollar deal ahead of a planned U.S. listing. Bukalapak, an e-commerce startup that holds the title of Indonesia's first unicorn and has backing from Microsoft Corp. and Ant Group Co., listed on the Jakarta stock exchange in August after raising about $1.5 billion in the country's largest-ever initial public offering.</p><p>Alpha JWC said its portfolio companies have raised more than $1 billion in 2021, with three achieving unicorn status in the past six months. The trio includes online stock-trading platform Ajaib, which hit the billion-dollar level after a $153 million Series B funding round last month, as well as online automotive marketplace Carro and digital credit platform Kredivo. At least 11 more companies are nearing unicorn status, Alpha JWC said.</p><p>The firm said the size of the new fund was partly tied to the performance of its first two funds, which it said have internal rates of return of 37% and 87%, respectively. The majority of portfolio companies from those funds received follow-on investments within a year.</p><p>\"It's about this year. Covid accelerated digital adoption, and we are seeing strong momentum,\" said Mr. Joe. There is \"a lot of demand for good-performing funds like ours, and there's a lot of supply of great founders coming to the market.\"</p><p>Alpha JWC was formed in 2015 by partners including Mr. Joe, a former chief operating officer of Groupon Inc.'s Indonesia business, and Chandra Tjan, a former banker in Singapore and a co-founder of East Ventures. In Indonesia, a fast-growing country of more than 270 million people where middle-class consumption and online engagement is rising, the firm initially saw itself as stepping into a relative void of independent, institutional early-stage financing for tech startups.</p><p>The firm's vision since its founding, Mr. Tjan said, has been \"to lead Indonesia and Southeast Asia's rise as the world's next major internet ecosystem.\"</p><p>The company has 50 active portfolio companies. It has made nine exits, including the acquisition of co-working space company Spacemob by WeWork Inc., and the acquisition of Singapore-based financial news specialist DealStreetAsia byJapan's Nikkei Inc.</p><p>Other regional firms are similarly tapping into the appetite for Southeast Asian startups. Jungle Ventures, a tech-focused venture-capital firm in Singapore, in September staged a first close of its fourth fund at $225 million, with plans to raise a total of about $350 million. Early-stage investor Openspace Ventures closed a new $200 million fund earlier this year.</p><p>Funding raised by venture-capital firms focused on Southeast Asia rose 31% to $7.2 billion in 2020, according to data provider Preqin Ltd. In 2021, firms have taken in another $4.6 billion in 68 funds, according to Preqin.</p><p>Write to Ben Otto at ben.otto@wsj.com</p>",
