  "title": "U.S., European Allies Plan How to Protect Ukraine From Russian Hacks; Officials fear cyberattacks could affect other countries in Eastern Europe",
  "text": "<p>But, she added, Ukraine comes first. \"The Ukrainian government is the key customer here and they have to determine what support they need, when and where to augment their own national capabilities,\" she said.</p><p>U.S. officials previously have warned that Russian military and intelligence services could launch cyberattacks against Ukraine's critical infrastructure, sowing confusion and disrupting daily life as part of a broader invasion.</p><p>In sanctions last month against four pro-Russian agents in Ukraine, the Treasury Department said the Kremlin's cyber operations in recent years have \"focused on disrupting one critical infrastructure sector in particular: Ukraine's energy sector.\" A 2015 hack of utilities in the country caused unprecedented blackouts.</p><p>Future Russian operations could also target sectors essential to Ukrainians, such as water, financial services and aviation, said Rachel Ellehuus, deputy director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. Disruptions to such services could put political pressure on Kyiv.</p><p>\"That pushes them in the direction of agreeing to Russian demands,\" she said.</p><p>A Jan. 23 alert from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned of similar hacks of U.S. companies if Russia \"perceived a U.S. or NATO response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security.\" But DHS said the Kremlin's threshold for carrying out such attacks \"probably remains very high.\"</p><p>Instead, many cybersecurity experts are more focused on potential spinoff hacks in Eastern Europe.</p><p>Andrzej Sadoś, Poland's ambassador to the EU, said he is concerned about attacks on his country, which shares a border with Ukraine. \"The goal is to divide the EU. The goal is to test if the governmental institutions are ready to defend,\" he said, referring to cyberattacks on Poland, Germany and other European countries last year that the union attributed to hackers backed by Russia. Hackers leaked Polish politicians' email messages online.</p><p>A large Russian attack could trigger sanctions, Mr. Sadoś said. The EU first issued sanctions for cyberattacks in 2020, and has since sanctioned both individuals and organizations for hacks affecting European countries.</p><p>Ms. Neuberger's meetings at NATO and with European Union member countries, including Poland, are part of a \"proactive trip\" to express support for allied countries as they worry about cyber threats emanating from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, she said. NATO and EU authorities are coordinating offers of cyber assistance to Ukraine, she said.</p><p>If the U.S. and European countries assist in preventing or responding to cyberattacks, Ukraine would need to determine what kinds of data foreign officials are allowed to access, and set parameters to make sure their work doesn't get in the way of Ukrainian cyber defense experts, said Jacob Galbreath, head of strategy for NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, an Estonia-based group that organizes cyber exercises and provides research to NATO members and other countries.</p><p>Authorities overseeing a country's response to a cyberattack might limit the kinds of personal data that their counterparts from another country can access, for example, he said. A military unit from an allied country would provide different expertise compared with law enforcement experts, so officials would likely choose which experts they need most, he added.</p><p>\"It's not as simple as just showing up as a firefighter and fighting fire,\" he said.</p><p>After meetings with NATO and EU officials in Brussels, Ms. Neuberger will travel to Warsaw to discuss cyber defensive options with her counterparts from Poland and Baltic countries. Those eastern countries are particularly concerned that cyberattacks in Ukraine could have a ripple effect in their countries. Lithuania offered to send a team of emergency cyber defenders to Ukraine last month.</p><p>The American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine sent an email to its members last month after Microsoft Corp. warned that hackers installed wiper malware to disable computer systems in at least two local government agencies, said Andy Hunder, president of the business group. Mr. Hunder said he hasn't heard that any companies have been affected by the malware but his organization is holding online meetings and sending alerts to inform members about cyber risks.</p><p>\"Businesses are continuing to operate,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Catherine Stupp at Catherine.Stupp@wsj.com and David Uberti at david.uberti@wsj.com</p>",
