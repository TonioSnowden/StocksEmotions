  "text": "<p>An EU foreign-affairs spokeswoman, Nabila Massrali, confirmed that \"a local agent\" of the EU delegation in China has been detained since September. \"We are concerned for his well-being,\" she said.</p><p>China hasn't provided the EU with information on the allegations or specific charges that the employee faces, despite several requests for such details from the EU, according to Ms. Massrali.</p><p>The \"picking quarrels\" allegation is typically applied to disorderly conduct, such as brawling and damaging property, but Chinese authorities regularly have used it to prosecute activists and dissidents. The offense was expanded to include online behavior in 2013 by defining the internet as a public space. Offenders can be punished with up to 10 years in prison, depending on the severity of the violation.</p><p>Mr. An had maintained a vocal presence on China's WeChat social-media platform, where he expressed candid views on politics, and spoke favorably about democracy, according to the person familiar with the situation. Mr. An's WeChat account has been suspended in the past, the person said.</p><p>Mr. An has been working for the EU delegation as an information-technology support staffer since 2006, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p><p>EU diplomats in Beijing started looking for Mr. An after he disappeared, and eventually learned that he was being held by Chinese authorities, the person familiar said.</p><p>China's Foreign Ministry didn't respond to an emailed request to comment after working hours on Friday.</p><p>Mr. An's arrest was earlier reported by France's Le Monde newspaper, which said that the EU delegation to China sent three diplomatic notes to China's Foreign Ministry expressing concern about Mr. An and seeking information about his case, and hadn't heard back.</p>",
