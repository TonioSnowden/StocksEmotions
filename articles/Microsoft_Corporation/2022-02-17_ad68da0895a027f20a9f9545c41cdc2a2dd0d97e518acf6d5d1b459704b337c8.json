  "text": "<p>Some foreign investors say the exchange's real problem is the entire edifice of corporate management in Japan, where many big companies are sitting on cash and stagnating. These investors say many companies see a listing on the exchange's top section as an honorary distinction rather than as a spur to engage with shareholders.</p><p>\"Japan is not an easy country to invest in for the global community. There's a peculiar corporate culture as well,\" said Masakazu Takeda, a portfolio manager with the Hennessy Japan Fund based in Hong Kong.</p><p>The Tokyo Stock Exchange's president, Hiromi Yamaji, says lifting standards is best done slowly and steadily. His supporters point to signs of change in recent years: More foreigners and women are serving on Japanese boards, deal-making is on the rise and activist investors have helped lift value at some of the market's stalwarts.</p><p>The overhaul \"is just a starting point and I think it's a good starting point,\" said Mr. Yamaji in an interview.</p><p>The Tokyo market, which in the late 1980s accounted for some 40% of the world's stock-market value, is now in its entirety worth less than Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc. together. In market value, Tokyo's total of about $6.2 trillion comes in fifth globally after the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Stock Market and markets in Europe and China.</p>",
