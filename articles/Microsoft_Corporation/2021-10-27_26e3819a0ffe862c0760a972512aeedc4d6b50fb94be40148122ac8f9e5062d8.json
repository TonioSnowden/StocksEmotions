  "text": "<p>The results exceeded analyst expectations of $44 billion in sales and $15.7 billion in profit, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.</p><p>The Redmond, Wash., software company said it expected to bring in between $50.15 billion and $51.05 billion in revenue in the current quarter.</p><p>The company's shares, which have climbed more than 45% over the last 12 months, were little changed in after-hours trading after the announcement.</p><p>The lukewarm market reaction to Microsoft's earnings beat is most likely due to the shares being \"priced in prior to the print,\" said Brad Reback, an analyst at Stifel Financial Corp.</p><p>Microsoft is among tech companies that have benefited most from the sustained shift to working-from-home and remote schooling that followed the outbreak of Covid-19.</p><p>Companies and consumers embracing digital services that run on the cloud have been at the center of its growth. Demand for personal computers, many using the company's Windows software, has surged over the past 18 months as has demand for Microsoft's latest videogame Xbox consoles.</p><p>The cloud business is one of the fastest growing in tech, expected to expand from $706.6 billion in 2021 to $1.3 trillion by 2025, according to research firm International Data Corp. Microsoft is the second-largest player in the industry with nearly a 20% share of the world-wide cloud computing market after Amazon.com Inc., which dominates with more than a 40% share, according to Gartner Inc.</p><p>Microsoft said Tuesday that Azure and other cloud-computing services grew by 50% in what was its fiscal first quarter. The company said its Microsoft Cloud business, a broader representation of the company's overall cloud business, generated $20.7 billion in sales for the quarter, up 36% from the previous year. That was its first time reaching the $20 billion quarterly sales mark.</p><p>\"We are building Azure as the world's computer with more data center regions than any other provider, delivering fast access to cloud services while addressing critical data residency requirements,\" Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said on a conference call with analysts after the earnings announcement.</p><p>The company's overall games business grew by 16%, driven by high demand for its latest consoles which came out late last year. Console sales jumped 166% from a year earlier. Console sales will continue to face supply-chain uncertainty in the current quarter, said Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood on the earnings call.</p><p>Sales from its Xbox content and service business expanded only 2%. The modest growth reflects the strong prior-year performance, said Kendra Goodenough, director of investor relations at Microsoft.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
