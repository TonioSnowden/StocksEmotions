  "text": "<p>Even for companies not operating in the region, Russia's invasion of Ukraine heaps fresh risks on a global economy already struggling with soaring inflation amid the recovery from the pandemic.</p><p>Oil and Gas</p><p>Energy companies are among the most exposed to the region, with major oil companies BP PLC, Shell PLC and Exxon Mobil Corp. having sizable investments in Russia. While those companies stand to benefit from higher commodity prices, they could also be among those potentially exposed to sanctions or disruption in Russia.</p><p>BP holds a 19.75% stake in Russian energy giant Rosneft Oil Co., and the British company's chief executive sits on the Russian company's board of directors. BP has said it is monitoring the situation, while executives earlier in February played down the potential risk of sanctions as tensions escalated.</p><p>Consumer Goods</p><p>Several large consumer-goods companies have factories in Ukraine, including Danish brewer Carlsberg A/S, Swiss food giant Nestlé SA and Davidoff cigarettes maker Imperial Brands PLC. All of those companies have suspended operations in the country in recent days, calling for their staff to stay safe at home.</p><p>Philip Morris International Inc. has also said it is suspending operations in Ukraine, including its factory in Kharkiv, as Russian forces continue to attack the country.</p><p>Among the most exposed is Carlsberg, which has eight breweries in Russia. The brewer has said it generates around 10% of its overall revenue in the country. Yogurt maker Danone SA says it generates about 5% of its revenue from Russia, where it says it mostly sources, produces and sells locally, rather than sending products across borders.</p><p>Autos</p><p>Several major auto makers have plants in Russia, including Volkswagen AG, Renault SA and Stellantis NV, the owner of the Dodge and Jeep brand. Those companies have kept plants running so far but have said they are on alert for potential disruption to come.</p><p>Stellantis said it was prepared to shift or limit production of its vehicles in Russia if Western sanctions disrupt those operations. Its plant in Kaluga, 115 miles southeast of Moscow, has been ramping up production in recent months for export to Western Europe amid rising demand.</p><p>Meanwhile, Renault CEO Luca de Meo recently said worsening tensions between Russia and Ukraine could lead \"to another supply chain crisis linked to parts that would have to come from abroad.\" Renault said about 90% of vehicles it makes in Russia were for the local market.</p><p>Russia is one of Renault's largest markets, having in 2014 taken a controlling stake—alongside its partner Nissan Motor Co.—in AvtoVAZ, the former state-owned Lada manufacturer. Renault generates around 8% of its earnings before interest and taxes in Russia, according to research by Citi.</p><p>Auto makers, already struggling with a shortage of semiconductors, could also face additional problems if Russia's supply of palladium were to slow.</p><p>Airlines</p><p>While Ukraine isn't a major destinations for big global carriers, they will be impacted by airspace restrictions. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency has instructed airlines to avoid Ukrainian airspace, as well as that of neighboring Moldova and Belarus. Aircraft have also been restricted from flying in Russia's southwest Rostov region and in airspace within 200 nautical miles of Ukraine's border.</p><p>Separately, Russia has banned airlines flying aircraft registered in the U.K. from operating in its airspace, responding to a similar move from the U.K. government as part of its package of sanctions. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. said they had rerouted some of their operations around Russia, leading to longer flight times on some trips. Russian airspace is often used for many routes between Europe and Asia.</p><p>Healthcare</p><p>Global pharmaceutical companies are looking to ensure that their medicines and vaccines can continue to reach Ukrainian patients. Ukraine relies heavily on medicines from overseas: Imported medicines and vaccines were worth $2.5 billion in 2020, according to United Nations trade data. The biggest share of that comes from Germany, where many large Western drugmakers have plants.</p><p>Roche Holding AG said it was continuously working to ensure patients in Ukraine and Russia had access to its medicines and diagnostics. Denmark's Novo Nordisk A/S, one of the world's biggest insulin makers, said it was monitoring the safety of the roughly 100 people it has in Ukraine.</p><p>Tech</p><p>In recent years, companies in the U.S. and Europe have outsourced tech services to Ukraine. Following Russia's incursion, internet outages occurred across the country, according to a monitoring dashboard run by the Georgia Institute of Technology.</p><p>Technology companies, including German software provider SAP SE and London-based financial-technology company Revolut Ltd., as well as Israel-based services marketplace Fiverr International Ltd. and website design and development platform Wix.com Ltd., say they employ workers in the region. SAP said it had closed its Kyiv office and taken safeguarding measures to support its employees, while Wix said it evacuated employees to Poland and Turkey.</p><p>The CEO of Grammarly, a startup founded in Ukraine that aims to improve people's writing, said he is hopeful that the situation between Russia and Ukraine de-escalates but that his company has also prepared for the worst. Brad Hoover said in a LinkedIn post that Grammarly \"remains committed to Ukraine,\" is still hiring for various team roles and that the company has plans in place to ensure its services won't get disrupted.</p><p>Agriculture</p><p>U.S. agriculture companies operating in Ukraine are closing offices and facilities in the country in response to Russia's attack. Archer Daniels Midland Co. said it has stopped operating its facilities in Ukraine, where the crop trader and processor employs more than 630 people. ADM's Ukraine facilities include an oilseed crushing plant in Chornomorsk, a grain terminal in the port of Odessa, six grain silos and a trading office in Kyiv.</p><p>Agriculture giant Bunge Ltd., which employs more than a thousand workers in Ukraine, temporarily suspended its own operations at two processing facilities in the country.</p><p>Cargill Inc. said that an ocean vessel it chartered was hit by a projectile offshore from Ukraine on the Black Sea on Thursday. The food supplier, which operates an export terminal in Ukraine, said the ship is still seaworthy and no one was injured. The crew is accounted for and the ship is headed for Romania, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>Benjamin Katz, Denise Roland, Saabira Chaudhuri, Nick Kostov, William Boston, Isabelle Bousquette, Suman Bhattacharyya, Patrick Thomas, Jenny Strasburg, Allison Prang, Will Feuer and Paul Hannon contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alistair MacDonald at Alistair.Macdonald@wsj.com and Peter Stiff at peter.stiff@wsj.com</p><p>What the Russia-Ukraine Crisis Means for Businesses</p>",
