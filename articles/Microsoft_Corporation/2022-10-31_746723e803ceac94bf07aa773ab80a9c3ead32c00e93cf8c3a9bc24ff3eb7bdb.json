  "title": "How to delete your Twitter account if Elon Musk's takeover has you serious about signing off; Shonda Rhimes, Stephen King and video game news source Nibel have threatened to leave Twitter. Here's what you need to know about how to deactivate or delete your Twitter account.",
  "text": "<p>The billionaire Tesla TSLA founder recently completed his $44 billion Twitter purchase, tweeting \"the bird is freed\" among a flurry of eyebrow-raising posts that have promised to bring \"free speech\" back to the platform — but without letting Twitter become a free-for-all hellscape, Musk said.</p><p>Some users aren't convinced, however, with NBA star LeBron James calling on Musk to respond to the \"scary AF\" reported increase in the use of the N-word on the social media platform since the takeover.</p><p>And some celebrity users have also announced that they intend to leave Twitter now that Musk is in charge. \"Grey's Anatomy\" creator and \"Bridgerton\" producer Shonda Rhimes, who has 1.9 million Twitter followers, tweeted, \"Not hanging around for whatever Elon has planned. Bye.\"</p><p>Grammy award-winning singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles also tweeted her Twitter swan song. And the reporter behind popular video game news source Nibel also announced that they are leaving Twitter, because, \"I do not trust the platform. I do not trust Musk and his seemingly infinite immaturity.\"</p><p>What's more, bestselling horror author Stephen King, who has 6.8 million Twitter followers, also threatened to leave the platform if Musk follows through with reported plans to make verified users pay to keep their blue checkmarks. He wrote, \"$20 a month to keep my blue check? F— that, they should pay me. If that gets instituted, I'm gone like Enron.\"</p><p>It should be noted that these accounts were still active as of Monday morning, however.</p><p>But such threats to leave the site are to be expected now that it's under new ownership. Indeed, after the Twitter board first accepted Musk's bid for the social media platform last April, hashtags like #RIPTwitter and #DeleteTwitter began trending as some users threatened to leave the site. And Google searches for \"how do I delete my Twitter account\" climbed 350% at the time.</p><p>Whether Twitter Inc. TWTR will actually see a mass exodus of disgruntled users — or perhaps an influx of newbies excited by Musk's plans for the platform — remains to be seen.</p><p>But for those serious about signing off, here's a rundown of the differences between deleting and deactivating account, and what else users need to know about actually deleting Twitter.</p><p>You have to deactivate your Twitter account for a month before you can permanently delete it.</p><p>Twitter's FAQ page notes that deactivating an account is the first step in deleting it.</p><p>First, sign into your Twitter account as usual, and tap your profile icon in the top left corner of the screen. Then scroll down to \"Settings and privacy\" and select \"Your account &gt; Deactivate your account.\" You can select a 30-day window or a 12-month window to reactivate your account, which Twitter says \"gives you space to decide if you'd like to reactivate your account.\"</p><p>What does deactivating your Twitter account do?</p><p>This means your username/handle and your public profile will no longer be seen on Twitter.com or the Twitter app for iOS and Android.</p><p>What if I decide to reactivate my Twitter account?</p><p>You have 30 days before your account gets permanently deleted. So if you change your mind within that roughly month-long window, go back to Twitter.com/login on your browser, or open the Twitter app on your mobile device. Login as usual, and a notice will pop up asking you to confirm whether you want to reactive your account. If you do opt to reactivate your Twitter account, you'll be redirected to your timeline. Twitter cautions that it may take \"a while\" for your tweets, followers, likes and the like to fully restore, however.</p><p>How do I delete my Twitter account?</p><p>If you decide that you're dunzo with Twitter, then simply leave your account as deactivated. After the 30-day deactivation window, your Twitter account will be canceled for good. This means that your username will now be up for grabs by other Twitter accounts. And you won't be able to reactivate the deleted account, or have access to any of your old Tweets. If you want to download your Twitter data, you will need to request it before you deactivate your account.</p><p>But keep in mind that deleting your Twitter does not delete any of your tweets or Twitter information that may have been archived by search engines like Alphabet's GOOGL Google or Microsoft's MSFT Bing. And any mentions of your account's username in other users' Tweets will still exist.</p><p>Twitter may also hold onto some information on your deactivated account \"to ensure the safety and security of its platform and people using Twitter,\" the company says. In other words: what you put on the internet stays on the internet forever.</p><p>Read more on Musk's new Twitter ownership:</p><p>Elon Musk completes Twitter purchase, fires CEO and other top execs: reports</p><p>Twitter braces for mass layoffs under new owner Elon Musk</p><p>Want that blue Twitter checkmark?
