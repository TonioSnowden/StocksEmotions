  "title": "How Rivian's CEO became the anti-Elon",
  "text": "<p>I'm sitting behind the wheel of a recently minted Rivian R1T pick-up truck, about to take a test drive around a track near the company's 3.3-million square-foot manufacturing plant in Normal, Illinois, 132 miles south-west of Chicago. My left foot is on the brake. My right foot is on the accelerator. Both are floored, but I'm not moving yet. </p> <p>Lily Macaruso and Laura Ewan, my Rivian guides for this maiden voyage, are asking me to count down from three and take my foot off the brake when I get to one. They are also urging me to brace myself and ask if, by the way, I suffer from motion sickness. Starting to get a little nervous, I wonder what they are talking about. </p> <p>In a conventional truck — one with a combustion engine — “flooring it” is frowned upon as doing so can flood the engine with gas. But I'm in a Rivian. There is no engine; there's just a massive battery pack nestled underneath the cabin I'm sitting in. I get to one and release my left foot. The R1T explodes — and I mean explodes — down the pavement. We go from zero to well above 60 miles per hour in what seems like an instant. The G&#xa0;force feels tremendous.</p> <p>It's too much raw power for me. I immediately feel nauseous, like I might pass out. I begin to think I'll shortly part with the delicious creamy Tuscan cavatappi pasta, with sun-dried tomatoes, caramelised onions and spinach I've had for lunch, as prepared by Josh Glaser, Rivian's culinary programme manager, who oversees the making of 3,000 meals a day. Glaser cooked my lunch on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTjViMJ3o1Y\">R1T's Camp Kitchen</a>, a luxurious all-purpose outdoor cooking contraption that slides in and out of the pick-up's underbelly fully assembled (for an extra $5,000). </p> <p>Seconds later, I take my foot off the accelerator, putting an immediate end to the mad rush of adrenaline. Then I take the R1T through its paces, effortlessly scaling a pile of boulders, a gravel and dirt berm at a 45-degree angle and, then, some serious high-speed cornering. I decline Macaruso's offer to drive backwards down a pile of rocks and return to home base blown away by the R1T, which has a base price of $67,500.</p> <p>The pick-up is a marvel of electric-vehicle technology and the culmination of the decades-long determination of pretty much one man, Robert Joseph Scaringe, known to Rivian's more than 12,000 employees and nearly everyone else as “RJ”. Scaringe, 39, is tall and athletic. He resembles Clark Kent in appearance and manner, down to the boxy eyeglasses and the slicked-back, jet-black hair. He also does the occasional Superman impression, which doesn't surprise admirers of what he has accomplished since he started Rivian in 2009. </p> <p>He once ran a marathon in Florida on a dare, to impress the woman he was dating. He outran her by a nose, even though she had trained for it and he hadn't. Another time, while in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, to raise financing, he and a friend climbed a 561-foot flagpole. “It was hot,” Scaringe says. “I was in a suit, but I dropped the tie.” His house in Laguna Beach, California, is on a big hill. When friends come over, he often casually suggests going for “a walk”, which his unsuspecting guests soon find out is a seven-mile hike. “Once you go three miles, there's no way back, but back,” he tells me. “I always get people to do that. And it's fun.” </p> <p>This penchant for one-upmanship aside, Scaringe can best be described as the anti-Elon Musk. He's a family man, with a wife and three young children. He's vegan. Thanks to one of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2fb010f-0d29-4e80-8ad7-797973d463f7\">most successful initial public offerings in years</a> — in November, the company raised $13.7bn — his net worth these days is closer to about $530mn compared with Musk's $265bn. </p> <p>His single focus is building vehicles that change the way we consume fossil fuels to try to combat climate change. He has no interest in Mars, or rockets, or building tunnels, or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rjscaringe?lang=en\">Twitter</a>, either to use or to own. He has more than 60,000 followers, but rarely tweets. In fact, he only follows a handful of people, two of whom are Jeff Bezos and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6a4fcae-99ba-11ea-adb1-529f96d8a00b\">José Andrés</a>, the Spanish-born chef. </p> <p>“[He's] totally like a serious down-to-earth guy living in the Midwest and building this business,” says hedge fund manager <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10bf413d-cfab-4ace-892b-713e91d759c8\">Dan Loeb</a>, who made a pre-IPO investment in Rivian. “He's been so thoughtful. He's the opposite of someone who shoots from the hip. Everything is planned and analysed.” And it has been for a very long time.</p>  <p><strong>Scaringe has been pining to run</strong> his own car company since he was a 17-year-old growing up on the Atlantic coast of Florida, just south of Cape Canaveral. “If you were to go in my bedroom as a kid, you'd find [car] hoods under the bed and windshields in the closet,” he says. We are sitting together in Rivian's delivery centre, where a couple of hundred R1Ts are waiting to be shipped to customers who have pre-ordered them. </p> <p>As my pulse returns to normal, Scaringe unspools his life story. When he was a teenager, he started tinkering with cars and restoring them. As he got older, he realised the combustion-powered cars he loved were a big cause of the world's most acute problems, including pollution, climate change and wars over oil. “I went into this period of getting really bummed about it,” he says. </p> <p>On a family trip, he decided he was going to devote himself to solving the problem. His “crude idea”, he tells me, was to start a car company. He was in high school. “I had no idea what that meant,” he says. “I had no idea how complex it was. I had no idea what would go into it. I then began thinking about ‘How do you go do something like this?'” He followed in the footsteps of his father, also an engineer named Robert, to the Rochester Polytechnic Institute, in upstate New York and finished at the top of his class.</p> <p>At college, it began to dawn on Scaringe that he would need huge amounts of capital to start a car company. He wasn't sure which was the wiser approach: to work for a big auto manufacturer for a decade, get some credibility and then try to raise capital based on his résumé, or find a “more accelerated path”. Impatient — and a bit naive — he opted for the quicker fix. He decided to go to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge to get a masters degree and then a PhD in mechanical engineering at the school's Sloan Automotive Laboratory. </p> <p>At MIT, he learnt that the big car companies were very good at manufacturing at scale, very good at introducing new models and styles, and very good at rehashing the status quo. But they were not very good at changing course or introducing a totally new concept. “The greater the change, the harder it is to adopt,” he says. “The idea of maybe changing a door handle architecture is some level of complexity. The idea of changing a vehicle architecture is another level. And the idea of changing your entire workforce to focus differently on software and electronics is another whole level of complexity — you have to redesign the guts of the company.” </p> <p>His <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Extension-of-the-high-load-limit-in-the-Homogeneous-Scaringe/e60223ad23a936823da7dc75f8536bd832e59a70\">PhD thesis</a> was an examination of the “homogeneous charge compression ignition engine” — a way to compress both air and fuel to create power more efficiently. But, he concluded, he was trying to solve the wrong problem. “We don't need to make better engines,” Scaringe says. “We need to not make engines.”</p> <p>One summer in Cambridge, Scaringe decided to try to reduce his carbon footprint. He figured if he was going to be an outspoken advocate for combating climate change, he needed to do his part. He took cold showers. He turned off his air conditioner. He stopped using his washer and dryer. He tracked his carbon usage. He discovered he still used a lot of carbon. “That sucked,” he says. “I would never choose to do that. And so to say to the whole world, ‘Do that, live like it's 120 years ago' will never work.” </p> <p>He had been mulling a company making small cars with electric motors, figuring smaller cars, smaller carbon footprint. But after that summer, he abandoned the idea. He'd realised that inspiring mass adoption of electric vehicles — on the order of 100 million vehicles — required building something people would want to own. </p> <p>“Nobody's going to sign up to take cold showers,” he says. “Nobody's going to sign up for not using their washing machine. That ‘ah-ha' led me to say, ‘Now I realise I need to build something that was massively desirable, and it needs to be desirable in a way that extends above and beyond your combustion alternative.'” </p> <p>James Womack, the research director at MIT's International Motor Vehicle Program and a pioneer in adopting Toyota's “lean manufacturing” ideas in the US auto sector, remembers being blown away by Scaringe after meeting him for five minutes at MIT. “Wow, this guy is different,” he thought to himself. “This guy is on a different level from everybody else around here . . . This guy can change the world.” </p> <p>After receiving his PhD in 2009, Scaringe was again faced with the decision of whether to work for an established car company or to start his own. “The likelihood of success starting my own company with no capital, no team, no technology, no plants, no suppliers, no brand, no product, was incredibly low,” he says. “It was really low-probability.” Still, on a comparative basis, he thought it was a higher probability than having an impact on an old-line company as an entry-level PhD graduate. </p> <p>It couldn't have been a worse moment to start a car company. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, both General Motors and Chrysler were in bankruptcy and desperate for a federal bailout. Ford only escaped the same fate because it had mortgaged itself to the hilt — including its iconic logo — just before the crisis hit. </p> <p>For the next two years, Scaringe focused on creating a prototype of a new sports car he could build a brand around and then introduce new products once the first model caught on — exactly the strategy Musk employed to turn Tesla into a juggernaut. Scaringe got the sports car to work, sort of. “In the video, it looked real,” he explains. “In reality, it was 0.0001 per cent real.” He decided to abandon the project and start from scratch. “Those two years led me to have a much more mature understanding of the question we're trying to solve, which was, how do we maximise impact?” he says. “And once I realised that was the question it was this mental ah-ha, this massive unlock.” </p> <p>That's when Scaringe landed on the idea of building an electric pick-up, the R1T. “It's the most popular segment in the United States,” he says of pick-ups. “It's the least efficient vehicle on the road. It's the one that everyone tells us we're crazy to try to do, so let's go prove them otherwise. And in the best case, we've built a business on it. In the worst case, we've proved to the existing [manufacturers] to see it differently.” </p> <p>In the process, he redesigned the classic architecture of the pick-up truck. The driveshaft no longer went front to rear, which opened up space in the middle of the truck for storage (including the kitchen) and allowed Scaringe and his team to focus the marketing of the R1T on outdoor adventures. He freely and frequently told people he was building the Patagonia of pick-up trucks, or what he calls “adventure vehicles”. (Rose Marcario, the former CEO of Patagonia, is on the Rivian board of directors.) </p> <p>At the time, electric cars were getting less and less niche, but a battery-powered pick-up still seemed far-fetched. And, once again, Scaringe was overwhelmed by the need for capital. “You can sort of rationalise how you might be able to start a car company for very little money,” he tells me. “And as you start to learn more and understand the problem more, you realise it's not something you do for $1mn or $2mn or $10mn. It's something for which you need billions of dollars.”</p> <p>Scaringe has raised billions for Rivian, from a variety of blue-chip investors. In addition to the $13.7bn Rivian raised in the November 2021 IPO — the largest in the US since 2014 — he also raised another $10.4bn or so of equity in five rounds between February 2019 and January 2021, from a group of blue-chip investors including T Rowe Price, Fidelity, Ford, Amazon, Manheim Investments (an affiliate of the wealthy Cox family) and Loeb, the hedge fund manager. </p> <p>Baillie Gifford, Franklin Templeton, Blackstone, Coatue Management and D1 Capital invested in Rivian as well. Ford, Amazon, Manheim and T Rowe Price each purchased from Rivian a portion of a $2.5bn offering of convertible notes. Manheim will sell the gas-powered trade-ins for Rivian's customers, and Rivian is in the process of building 100,000 electric delivery vans for Amazon. On his journey to Texas for his suborbital Blue Origin flight last July, Bezos drove an R1T.</p>  <p><strong>Funding secured, Scaringe set out</strong> to fulfil his dream. Rivian purchased the plant in Normal in 2017 for $16.5mn from Diamond-Star Motors, a joint venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi Motors, which closed it in 2015. The company renovated the building and added 700,000 square-feet of space to it, with plans for more. “Normal is a whole bunch of people with enormous amounts of adrenaline loaded into their systems, trying to go fast,” Womack says. Rivian has plans for a new manufacturing facility near Atlanta. The company's headquarters is in Irvine, California; its software development and vehicle electronics division is in Palo Alto.</p> <p>In the early days, both Scaringe and his father mortgaged homes they owned and invested the proceeds in Rivian, which is a blend of the words “Indian River”, a lagoon near where Scaringe grew up in Florida. Scaringe also raised $160mn from Global Oryx Company, a subsidiary of Abdul Latif Jameel (ALJ), a large, diversified Saudi holding company. </p> <p>Scaringe points out that ALJ has philanthropic links to MIT, including its world-renowned “poverty lab”, which was co-founded by the Nobel Prize-winning economists <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec6ace8c-ee73-11e9-bfa4-b25f11f42901\">Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo</a>. He says Rivian has not had any backlash arising from the Jameel family investment, despite its Saudi ties. “This wasn't as if PIF” — the Saudi sovereign wealth fund — “was investing in the business,” he says. “It was a wealthy family of Saudi descent that runs a global international business — obviously with operations in Saudi, as well, but more importantly a business that really sort of was asking the question of, ‘How can we do better by the world?'” </p> <p>Not surprisingly, the billions of dollars in capital that Scaringe has raised has diluted his ownership in Rivian to below 2 per cent, although he's been granted Musk-like options with the potential to allow him to own more. He expects to get criticised for that at some point but not to have Musk-level wealth. “If purely my motive was to make a lot of money, there's lots of ways to do it that are easier than what we've done here,” he tells me. “This is a really hard way to make a lot of money, and a really unlikely way to make money.”</p> <p>Scaringe has made plenty of mistakes. In January, two months after the IPO, Rod Copes, Rivian's chief operating officer, announced he was leaving the company just as it was due to ramp up production after manufacturing about 1,000 vehicles in 2021. (The company built 2,553 trucks in the first quarter of 2022.) Copes' unexpected departure hit the Rivian stock hard. It fell nearly 9 per cent on the news. </p> <p>The company subsequently explained that Copes' retirement had been planned for months and had occurred in December. Scaringe tells me Copes and Rivian parted ways before the IPO — he is not named in the prospectus — and that the confusion resulted after Copes updated his LinkedIn page in January. “It was very transparent to any of the investors,” Scaringe explains. “It came across as a surprise. We should have done something more proactive, obviously, in hindsight.” It was “poorly managed communications”, he adds. </p> <p>Then there is the matter of Laura Schwab, who joined as vice-president of sales and marketing in December 2020, having been lured away from her job as Aston Martin's president of the Americas. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef059fdd-408e-4976-8b2a-1a8cb19ce2c4\">Schwab claims in a lawsuit</a> filed after she was fired during the IPO process that six months into her post she experienced acute gender discrimination. </p> <p>“Rivian publicly boasts about its culture, so it was a crushing blow when I joined the company and almost immediately experienced a toxic bro culture that marginalises women and contributes to the company making mistakes,” she wrote on Medium. “I raised concerns to HR about the gender discrimination . . . the ‘boys club' culture, and the impact it was having on me, my team and the company.” Two days later, she wrote, she was fired.</p> <p>Schwab also claims she tried to discuss her view that Rivian vehicles were priced too low, but nobody would listen. “The company's founder, RJ Scaringe, was clearly and literally in the driver's seat, and he surrounded himself with a tight-knit group of men who constantly had his ear,” she wrote. Schwab's lawsuit against Rivian is ongoing so Scaringe declines to comment about it, other than to say, “Situations like Laura Schwab you're going to have in a business that's this large and this big. You're going to have those types of things come up.”</p> <p>On March 1, some four months after Schwab's firing and after she urged, to no avail, that vehicle prices be increased, Rivian suffered its worst self-inflicted public relations disaster, when it announced — seemingly out of the blue — that it was raising prices on both the R1T, by about 17 per cent or about $12,000, and the R1S SUV, by 20 per cent, about $14,500. The hike was the result of “inflationary pressure on the cost of supplier components and raw materials across the world”, the company wrote in an email sent to the more than 71,000 people who had pre-ordered the vehicles. </p> <p>The news came as a shock to customers — including me, for my pre-ordered R1S — who had ponied up a $1,000 deposit long before. Rivian was already behind on its delivery schedule and now was reneging on its agreements with customers, at a time when lots of car companies were marketing new electrics. Rivian underestimated the implied contract that existed between itself and customers who had pre-ordered, put down deposits and configured vehicles. Customers left in droves, getting deposit refunds. </p> <p>Scaringe was shocked. It was his worst day as Rivian's leader. He personally made calls to customers. “It, like, hurts my soul to talk about this,” he tells me. “But the way we communicated was shitty.” He then amends his answer: “The way we communicated was flawed. It was flawed. And then the execution of that was flawed. And the idea itself was flawed.” Two days later, the company reversed course, restoring original pricing for customers who had pre-ordered before March 1. Anyone who had cancelled could reorder at the initial price. </p> <p>It was the kind of mistake that results from too much groupthink and analysis paralysis, and a failure to step back and consider how trust might be severed with such a momentous step. “This is going to be, I'm sure, a case study,” Scaringe says. He adds the decision was flawed by “feedback loops” and internal “studies” that convinced him and his top team that prices should be — and could be — increased across the board to combat the increasing costs of Rivian's raw materials, especially semiconductors and battery packs. </p> <p>Womack thinks that sometimes Scaringe can be too analytical for his own good. “If he had just taken his head off the instrument panel and looked out the window, he never would have done that,” he says. “He certainly is resilient psychologically. So he's not sitting there being droopy, but it was a pretty big swing at a pretty bad pitch.” </p> <p>Scaringe doesn't disagree. “If you could wind the clock back to February 28, and if we'd rolled this out differently, there's a lot of different ways we could have managed it,” he says. Ironically, these are the kinds of problems that plagued Detroit's big three manufacturers for decades, prolonging their reliance on gas guzzlers. “We learnt so much,” he says. “We'll make many mistakes going forward, but we'll never make a mistake like that again.”</p> <p>Then there was the break with Ford, which had invested some $1.7bn into Rivian and had agreed that the two companies would potentially partner together on various projects. According to Scaringe, he selected Ford as an investor in large part because there was no requirement that the two companies work together on an electric vehicle. He says Ford wanted to gain insight into a start-up electric vehicle manufacturer, without the legacy issues of a leading manufacturer of cars and trucks with combustion engines. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/425dd9dd-6e6d-4083-a019-2ddd38908789\">Ford</a> did not respond for a request for comment; but last month the company blamed its equity investment in Rivian for its first-quarter 2022 loss of $3.1bn. In 2021, Ford and Rivian parted ways commercially, though not financially, with Ford deciding to make an electric version of its bestselling F-150 pick-up truck. (First deliveries of the resulting F-150 Lightning, with a starting price of $39,974, will begin this week.)</p> <p>Scaringe says the split was by mutual agreement and in the best interests of both companies as well as society as a whole as Ford will be developing its own electric-power technology, expanding the electric vehicle pie. A rising tide lifts all boats, kind of thing. He says Rivian didn't have the “bandwidth” or the “resources” to develop products for Ford. </p> <p>He explains that the life cycle of a business goes from starvation and fighting for survival — can it get enough funding and customers? — to, if it's lucky, risking indigestion, “where you end up with this buffet line of opportunity”. He adds, “We have a lot of capital. We have so many good ideas for products. We have customers that want all of those different ideas. And so every company wants to transition to a world where you have a buffet. But not every company survives the buffet. Because if you try to eat too many things, you're going to kill yourself.” </p> <p>He says the split with Ford was “highly intentional” and that he's happy about it. “What used to stress me out the most back in the early days?” he asks, rhetorically. “It was not at all the idea of failing. It was the fact that we would have done all this work, and emitted all this carbon, and not helped solve the problem. That really stressed me out. I'd lose sleep over it. So, the fact that we've helped accelerate Ford, and the fact that we've helped spur interest in electric trucks, that's awesome. It's like we've had an impact. The world is going to electrify faster because of [our] actions as a company.”</p>  <p><strong>Perhaps, but the rash of mistakes</strong> — and perceived mistakes — took their toll on one of the most hyped IPOs of the past decade. After Morgan Stanley priced the Rivian IPO at $78 per share, valuing Rivian at some $66bn, the stock exploded upward, to as much as nearly $180 a share, valuing the company at about $180bn, more than Ford and GM combined and an astounding number for a wildly unprofitable company that has manufactured barely more than 3,500 vehicles. </p> <p>But that valuation was shortlived. On May 2, Rivian's stock was trading at $30.24 per share, 70&#xa0;per cent below its IPO price. Scaringe, once worth more than $3bn, is now worth about one-sixth of that amount. He seems not to care. He lives between Normal and Laguna Beach, where Rivian is restoring an old movie-theatre complex. </p> <p>He says he didn't like it when Rivian's stock hit more than $170 a share and then tells me something someone on Wall Street must have told him. “Stock markets are a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term. It doesn't really matter,” he adds. “The price went up more than it should have. It's gone down more than it should have. It's highly volatile. We did a large IPO for precisely these reasons. We said, ‘We don't want to be subject to behaving in a really short-term way.'” </p> <p>Jay Flatley, a Rivian board member, saw the power of Scaringe being able to take a longer-term approach when he reversed the decision on increasing the pricing on the Rivian vehicles. “It's a financial sacrifice for the company to protect the brand,” Flatley says. “To stand up and say the brand is more important than those gross margin dollars in the next 18 months takes a unique person. Because Wall Street's measuring you, in the short term.” </p> <p>Scaringe thinks the market is just trying to figure out whether Rivian can live up to its promise of manufacturing enough vehicles profitably, justifying whether it's really a company worth hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars, given the supply-chain issues and the cost increase of raw materials. (He tells me Rivian must pretty much beg Intel for the computer chips it needs to build its vehicles.) And, he says, Rivian will need more capital, which he has no intention of raising at these depressed equity prices. </p> <p>He thinks the macrodynamics for a manufacturer of electric vehicles are better today than they were at the time of Rivian's IPO. Petrol prices have skyrocketed. The R1T was named MotorTrend's 2022 Truck of the Year. He seems to have been forgiven by customers for the self-inflicted pricing fiasco. “You have demand that seems unstoppable,” he says. “It's sort of staggering how much demand there is for electric vehicles, and specifically for our vehicles.” </p> <p>Scaringe, of course, was concerned when Musk announced that Tesla was working on its own pick-up truck. On the one hand, he's a proponent of more competition. “The Olympics would be really boring if there was one competitor,” he says. On the other, well, Tesla's market value is about $900bn, while Rivian's is back down to around $30bn. </p> <p>Tesla is, in other words, a potentially serious competitor in the market for electric pick-up trucks. But when Musk unveiled his so-called Cybertruck in 2019, Scaringe was relieved. He starts to show me with his hands what he feared a Venn diagram of Tesla and Rivian might be. But he thinks, in the end, there will be only the slightest intersection between the two companies, at least when it comes to trucks. The Tesla pick-up is all angular lines and looks like a stealth bomber on wheels; the R1T's design is much gentler, with soft Modigliani-esque curves.</p> <p>At the beginning of my visit to the Normal manufacturing facility, as Scaringe was waxing poetic about Rivian to a small group of automobile journalists, he seemed to get choked up for a moment. “Thousands of people — there's more than 5,000 people on site — collectively gather to turn raw material into vehicles. And those coils of steel and aluminium within two weeks are driving off the plant as vehicles. And those are going out to take families to the beach, take couples on a date, take best friends mountain biking . . . ” It's the culmination of years of dreaming and hard work, Scaringe continues. “It's almost romantic when you think about what happens in this facility.” </p> <p><em>William D Cohan, a 2007 winner of the FT Business Book of the Year, is the author of the forthcoming “Power Failure: The Rise and Fall of an American Icon”</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>This article has been </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90f3e863-e939-41e4-85d0-099da23dff4c\"><em>corrected</em></a><em> since first publication to make clear Robert Joseph Scaringe was an undergraduate at Rochester Polytechnic Institute.<br>Baillie Gifford first invested in Rivian through its IPO in November 2021, not during the private funding rounds.</em></p><p>Source: William D Cohan  2022 'How Rivian's CEO became the anti-Elon' FT.com 5 May.
