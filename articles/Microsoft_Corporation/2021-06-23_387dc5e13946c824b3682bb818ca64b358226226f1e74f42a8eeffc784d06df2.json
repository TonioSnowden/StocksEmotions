  "text": "<p><em>The writer is founding director of The Inclusion Initiative at the London School of Economics</em></p> <p>The importance of improving inclusivity in financial services for all workers, regardless of gender, was the aim behind my Good Finance framework, released last week. The research stressed the importance of upskilling leaders, rather than relying on the glacial pace of change brought about by auditing, monitoring and quotas. It also pointed firmly to the problem of the mediocre manager. The response was immediate, polarised and depressing. </p> <p>Creating the framework, on behalf of Women in Banking and Finance, involved dozens of interviews and a survey of more than 2,000 workers in financial services. Men were not excluded and will indeed benefit if the framework were applied. Those who should not are persons of all genders who use office politics to get ahead and are mediocre in their competence levels. </p> <p>Many of the responses backed up the argument that mediocre managers are detrimental to financial services, as well as in other areas such as technology, utilities, transport, pharmaceuticals and academia. I received emails that described bullying, alongside more insidious behaviour such as exclusion from decision-making, silence when poor behaviour is questioned and being “managed away” when complaints are finally made.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>That wasn't the end though. Highlighting that it was problematic that people in financial services still get promoted and receive pay increases based on factors that are not related to their skills or output resulted in an avalanche of responses that scoffed at the idea that the mediocre manager exists. The women I interviewed were called moaners, whiners, woke and words the FT would not print. I was called a snowflake, third-rate and a hyped up “B” from Oxbridge (I attended my local university, the rest I unequivocally deny). One comment on LinkedIn highlighted that men have a biological advantage when it comes to hard work.&#xa0; </p> <p>Currently, the so called meritocracy conflates privilege with achievement. In particular, the privilege of incompetence afforded to individuals who are in the in-group. It is pretty intuitive that progression based on cronyism is reported less often by women in direct income-generating roles, such as trading, where progress is much easier to measure.&#xa0;</p> <p>The framework emphasises that people need opportunities to demonstrate their excellence. It also emphasises that one significant factor that holds women back in financial services is a lack of such opportunities. This is not necessarily because the managers they work with are sexist. Rather, they are blocked because their managers prefer others “like them”. A preference for others “like you” as a manager causes significant hiring, pay and promotion gaps.&#xa0;This will be true for all of those who find themselves in the out-group of a team where cronyism is alive and kicking, regardless of gender.&#xa0;</p> <p>Cronyism is bad for business. It is also bad for the wellbeing of those in the out-group. The women I met described being exhausted, emotionally depleted and riddled with anxiety from dealing with it. One said she had to develop “muscles” to deal with the effort. Another that she changed her identity like a chameleon each day to fit in. How much productivity are we losing by forcing employees to be mentally resistant to cronyism, for fear of being punished if they don't play the rules of the game?&#xa0;</p> <p>Soft skills are garnering higher wage premiums than they did in the past. Companies will have a competitive edge if they have managers that are both high in competence and skills such as empathy and authenticity. Let's ensure that this wage premium is given to leaders who “walk the talk”, and not to the virtue signallers. Let's ensure that the next generation of workers do not need to develop muscles to survive the office politics of the mediocre manager.</p><p>Source: Grace Lordan 2021 'Finance's myth of meritocracy rewards mediocre managers' FT.com 23 June.
