  "title": "European tech's record funding year",
  "text": "<p>Despite the disruption of the pandemic, 2021 is set to be an incredible boom year in investment in European technology companies.</p> <p>Atomico, the VC firm founded by Skype's<a href=\"https://atomico.com/team/niklas-zennstrom\"> Niklas Zennström</a> in 2006, published its annual <a href=\"https://stateofeuropeantech.com/chapter/executive-summary/\">State of European Tech </a>report today, with a headline number of $121bn invested this year — nearly three times the 2020 figure of $41bn and 10 times what it recorded in its first report in 2015.</p> <p>Getting past the $100bn mark for the first time was largely thanks to bigger rounds for later-stage companies of more than $250m, which grew by a factor of 10 in the past 12 months. In the first nine months of 2021 alone, there were 57 funding rounds of $250m-plus, part of more than 150 rounds of $100m or more. There were 68 rounds of $100m-plus in the UK, equating to 37 per cent of all rounds of this magnitude in Europe.</p> <p>There were 98 new unicorns — start-up companies valued at more than $1bn — added in Europe this year for a cumulative total of 321, but the main takeaway from the report is the growing depth of more substantial tech companies. </p> <p>Fintech is leading the way. The Dutch payments company Adyen is now worth $87bn, while five fintechs — Klarna, N26, Mollie, Revolut and Trade Republic — were in the Top Ten of largest raises of the year.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Bravo for more buyouts</strong><br>Buyout firm Thoma Bravo is looking to raise $35bn to continue its software spree,<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/456f2fd7-f868-4ea6-abd7-fce34e783333\"> reports Antoine Gara</a>. Its biggest deals this year were the $10.2bn buyout of real estate software company RealPage in April and the $12.3bn buyout of cyber security firm Proofpoint in August.</p> <p><strong>2. Intel to list Mobileye</strong><br>Intel says it is planning to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a5c21b0-0432-4c13-8680-ce490f2ac50e\">seek a separate stock market listing</a> for Mobileye, its driver-assistance and autonomous vehicle unit, as it looks to shore up its battered stock price. Intel paid $15bn for Mobileye in 2017 as part of a race to diversify into newer markets for chips. </p> <p><strong>3. Samsung's big shake-up</strong><br>Samsung Electronics has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a9f1a56-4f6c-48cf-9852-ba171582b58d\">reshuffled its management </a>for the first time in four years as it steps up its push into non-memory chips and artificial intelligence. Kyung Kye-hyun, chief executive of affiliate Samsung Electro-Mechanics, will be the new head of its semiconductor business, while its consumer electronics and mobile divisions will merge under Han Jong-hee, who has been head of Samsung's visual display business.</p> <p><strong>4. New EU rules on gig economy</strong><br>Gig economy companies will be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91cab445-90fa-4f08-bbaa-ea68ef9487c7#post-3f999e25-6b41-42bd-b4a1-19935459869e\">forced to prove</a> their workforces are self-employed contractors rather than employees, for the first time, under new draft legislation being published by Brussels this week. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7539abc6-27fe-41d9-9804-b26766045fae\">Lex says</a> Monday's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d340357b-c011-44af-b2bd-58a442cb50c7\">UK court ruling </a>against Uber further weakens a business model that was shaky to start with.</p> <p><strong>5. Bitcoin's rocky weekend</strong><br>Bitcoin's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5fb450b-9896-46d3-a8a7-9a9e6849b527\">20 per cent flash fall</a> on Saturday marked one of the first times a storm in traditional financial assets triggered big waves in cryptocurrencies, underscoring how large investors are playing an increasing role in digital asset markets. Meanwhile, The Big Read looks at how a new breed of money managers is hoping to&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12888496-2c3d-4ad9-a9cd-bd418e03cb44\">shake up the corporate credit market</a>&#xa0;using processing power, models, algorithms and big data to systematically wring cash out of pricing anomalies.</p> <h2>Tech tools — Death's Door</h2> <p>In this role-playing game now released on multiple platforms, you are a fledgling crow who is a new employee at a supernatural bureau of avian grim reapers. Your job is to collect the souls of those who have passed on. Yet when a soul you have collected is stolen, your own immortality is compromised, meaning you will age and ultimately die if you cannot recover it. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0d4efb1-27f7-4eab-a6f0-45a083fb9646\">Tom Faber says</a>&#xa0;indie publisher Devolver Digital has created an engrossing world with <em>Death's Door</em>: “This game is an exercise in minimalism: it gives players a precise dose of every element they need for a transporting experience.”</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'European tech's record funding year' FT.com 7 December.
