  "text": "<p>    Microsoft Corp.'s $75 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard Inc. reflects two trends driving consolidation in the videogame industry: the push to mobile and building for the metaverse. </p><p>    News of the deal sent shares of Activision and other videogame makers higher. Activision rose 26%, its largest percent increase since 1995, and closed as Tuesday's best performer in the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>   \"It's going to start a major ripple effect in terms of consolidation for other videogame publishers,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. </p><p>   Deal-making among videogame companies has surged in recent years amid gaming's growing popularity, particularly on mobile devices. Mobile games represent the largest and fastest-growing corner of the videogame industry at large. </p><p>   Videogames are also seen by analysts and industry executives as a pathway to the metaverse, the virtual world where people can play and shop using digital avatars. </p><p>   Microsoft's purchase of Activision will accelerate more deals in the industry, analysts said, as big tech companies seek to broaden their consumer game offerings. Last week, Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. agreed to buy Zynga Inc. for $11 billion. </p><p>   The prospect of more deals led to gains Tuesday among videogame stocks. Electronic Arts gained $3.47, or 2.7%, to $133.91. U.S.-listed shares of Ubisoft rose 8.5%, and Nintendo Co. added 2.2%. </p><p></p>",
