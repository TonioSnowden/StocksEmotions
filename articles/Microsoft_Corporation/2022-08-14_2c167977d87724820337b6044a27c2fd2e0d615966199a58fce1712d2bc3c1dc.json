  "title": "Judge Who Approved Trump Search Warrant Was in Role by Chance; Bruce Reinhart handled the FBI's request to search Mar-a-Lago when the on-duty judge was unavailable",
  "text": "<p>Judge Reinhart approved the warrant on Aug. 5, finding that the Federal Bureau of Investigation established probable cause that there was evidence of crime—an action that has kicked off a series of unprecedented events and put the judge at the center of a political firestorm.</p><p>FBI agents who searched Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence last Monday removed 11 sets of classified documents—including some marked as top secret—according to a list of items taken that was unsealed along with the warrant by Judge Reinhart on Friday.</p><p>Judge Reinhart, an Ivy League educated judge and former prosecutor who once defended allies of the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, has received anti-Semitic attacks and threats on multiple online forums, and his address and other personal details have been published on at least one of them.</p><p>\"It's the luck of the draw,\" said Florida State Attorney Dave Aronberg, who has been in touch with Judge Reinhart this past week, of the judge's role in the case. \"He gets up every day and does his job, without fear or favor.\"</p><p>Judge Reinhart's profile page has since been taken down from the court website. He couldn't be reached for comment. His clerk's LinkedIn page also has been taken down.</p><p>John Stinneford, a law professor at the University of Florida Levin College of Law who specializes in criminal and constitutional law, said that even if a judge disagreed with pursuing a search warrant at a particular time, they would still have to issue one if probable cause was shown.</p><p>\"If there is probable cause, they have to approve the warrant,\" said Mr. Stinneford, a former assistant U.S. attorney.</p><p>Judge Reinhart, 59 years old, spent 12 years as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of Florida before going into private practice for 10 years. Among those he represented were employees of Epstein, including Epstein's pilot and scheduler. Both received immunity from federal prosecution.</p><p>In 2008, Epstein's legal team struck a plea deal with the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida at the time, Alex Acosta, that shielded Epstein from federal sex-abuse charges and included a promise that federal prosecutors wouldn't notify his alleged victims of the arrangement. Mr. Acosta resigned from his role as Labor secretary in 2019 amid questions about his handling of the case.</p><p>As part of a lawsuit filed by two of Epstein's alleged victims against the U.S. in 2008, the victims argued in a 2011 motion that Judge Reinhart violated Justice Department policy by acting as a defense attorney for Epstein's employees after having access to confidential information about the Epstein case in his previous role as an assistant U.S. attorney.</p><p>Judge Reinhart said in a response at the time that he \"had no involvement in the Epstein investigation,\" and \"did not know any confidential information about the Epstein matter.\"</p><p>In 2018, Judge Reinhart was sworn in as a federal magistrate after being appointed by a majority vote of U.S. District Court Judges in South Florida, the same week that his wife, Carolyn Bell, was appointed as a state circuit court judge by then-Florida Gov. Rick Scott. In his role as one of three magistrate judges in Palm Beach County, he handles pretrial criminal and civil motions and other litigation matters in coordination with the district court judges.</p><p>Earlier this year, Judge Reinhart was assigned to a civil racketeering case brought by Mr. Trump against the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton and others over Russia collusion claims. In the lawsuit, Mr. Trump seeks to recover expenses in excess of $24 million he claims he was \"forced to incur\" defending himself from the defendants' accusations against him, in addition to the loss of current and future business opportunities. Mrs. Clinton has sought dismissal of the case, which is pending.</p><p>Judge Reinhart recused himself from that case without citing a reason, two months after another magistrate, Ryon McCabe, also recused himself without citing why. The case is now assigned to the only remaining magistrate judge in Palm Beach County, William Matthewman, the judge who was on duty earlier this month but unavailable to review the Mar-a-Lago search warrant.</p><p>After Judge Reinhart signed the warrant on Aug. 5, the FBI searched the home three days later, seizing about 20 boxes of materials, according to an inventory that was provided to the court and Mr. Trump's lawyers.</p><p>On Friday, Judge Reinhart issued an order making the warrant and inventory list public, after the Justice Department said in a court filing that Mr. Trump's lawyers told federal prosecutors they didn't object to the government's request to unseal the information.</p><p>Legal experts said Judge Reinhart didn't have the authority to consider the political or historical context surrounding the search warrant, such as whether it was a wise move for the Justice Department to seek a warrant to retrieve classified information from a former president's home.</p><p>Officials say that after repeated efforts to retrieve the boxes, they had information to suggest there was more material in Mr. Trump's home than they had been discussing with Mr. Trump's lawyers. Mr. Trump and his lawyers say they were negotiating in good faith and the search came as a surprise.</p><p>\"This is uncharted territory,\" said Richard Serafini, a criminal defense attorney in South Florida who worked as a trial attorney at the Justice Department at the same time as Judge Reinhart in the 1990s and knows him.</p><p>\"You don't want to live in a country where it becomes routine that when a new administration comes in, it investigates the prior president,\" Mr. Serafini added. \"You also don't want to live in a country where the president is above the rule of law.\"</p><p>Write to Deborah Acosta at deborah.acosta@wsj.com</p><p>Judge Who Approved Trump Search Warrant Was in Role by Chance</p>",
