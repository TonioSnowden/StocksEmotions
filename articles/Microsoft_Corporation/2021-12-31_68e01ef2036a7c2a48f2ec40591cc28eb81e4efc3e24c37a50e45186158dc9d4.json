  "text": "<p>Chinese tech group Tencent has taken a stake in Monzo, the latest international investor to join a funding round that values the UK digital bank at $4.5bn.</p> <p>The move, revealed on Friday, underlines a rapid recovery in Monzo's fortunes after a tough start to the pandemic that had crushed its valuation and even prompted outside warnings that it could struggle to stay afloat. </p> <p>“With the backing of some of the best names in the investment community, we're going into next year with big ambitions — and we're just getting started,” said Monzo's chief executive TS Anil.</p> <p>Tencent, one of China's biggest companies and most active tech investors, has built a significant global fintech portfolio, with deals in recent years including stakes in Argentine personal finance app Ualá, French start-ups Qonto and Lydia, and South African challenger bank Tyme.</p> <p>Its investment in Monzo is part of a $100m top-up to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e9bbe27-2dac-447b-a015-b2cd3bc9c868\">$500m round</a> led by the Abu Dhabi Growth Fund, first reported by the Financial Times in early December. </p> <p>The Chinese group's move follows a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0484f00c-fede-4b15-9108-9437b6c776b4\">£919m deal</a> in July to buy UK games developer Sumo Group, which has made titles for Sony, Microsoft and Sega. </p> <p>The Shenzhen-based owner of Chinese messaging service WeChat has been on an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/422e3bd4-6c0c-493c-b888-883d331a89b9\">acquisition spree</a> over the past year, diversifying its portfolio of global tech companies even as Beijing tightened its scrutiny of Chinese tech groups. </p> <p>Monzo's latest funding, first reported by Sky News, reflects a startling rebound in its valuation, which in February fell to £1.25bn after a precipitous drop in card transactions, down from £2bn in 2019.</p> <p>The online bank announced a statutory net loss of £130m in 2020, an increase of 13 per cent compared with 2019. At the time, auditors EY warned for a second consecutive year of “material uncertainty” over its ability to continue operating as a going concern.</p> <p>Monzo has also faced regulatory setbacks over the past year, including an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b3281ef-f992-44c8-9afe-fdd507f6e80f\">investigation</a> by the Financial Conduct Authority over potential breaches of anti-money laundering laws. </p> <p>In October it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ea6d977-c2fc-47a8-9d93-1ec02eb4f9a9\">withdrew its application</a> for a US banking licence after regulators indicated it was unlikely to be approved.</p> <p>But investors have focused on its successes, with revenues doubling in 2021 against the year before. A quarter of its revenues came from new products launched during the pandemic, including its business and premium accounts, as it seeks to diversify.</p> <p>It is also exploring new developments such as a platform for retail investors to invest in stocks, according to people familiar with the matter. This could include cryptocurrency trading, although the planning is only at an exploratory stage.</p> <p>However, Monzo's valuation still trails its main UK digital rival Revolut, which achieved a $33bn valuation in a July funding round led by SoftBank's Vision Fund 2 and Tiger Global Management.</p><p>Source: Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan and Eleanor Olcott in London 2021 'China's Tencent takes stake in UK digital bank Monzo' FT.com 31 December.
