  "title": "Taiwan Battery-Swapping Pioneer Gogoro to Go Public in SPAC Merger; Taipei-based company said it plans to list on the Nasdaq Stock Market",
  "text": "<p>Gogoro will raise net proceeds of up to $550 million in the deal, stemming from $345 million raised in Poema's offering earlier this year and $250 million from a so-called PIPE, or private investment in public equity. The PIPE funding round, which is typical in SPAC mergers, includes backing from Taiwan electronics giant Foxconn Technology Group, Singaporean sovereign-wealth fund Temasek Holdings, Indonesia tech company GoTo Group and Generation Investment Management, a sustainable investment firm co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore.</p><p>Gogoro expects the deal to close in the first quarter of 2022 and it will trade under the ticker symbol GGR.</p><p>Founded in 2011, Gogoro makes electric scooters, batteries and networks of vending machine-sized battery stations where drivers can swap out depleted batteries for fresh ones. In Taiwan, where its batteries power the vast majority of all electric two-wheelers, the company operates a network of more than 2,100 battery-swapping stations that are paired with convenience stores, supermarkets, coffee shops and other venues.</p><p>Gogoro is betting on rising demand from consumers and policy makers in congested urban areas for electric two-wheelers and also for battery-swapping systems that work across brands and offer a speedier alternative to charge-based systems. Its early backers include Temasek, Mr. Gore's firm, Panasonic Corp., Sumitomo Corp., France's Engie SA and others.</p><p>\"We firmly believe that electric mobility adoption is inevitable,\" Chief Executive Horace Luke, a former executive at Microsoft Corp. and Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC Corp., said in an interview. \"This decade is the beginning of it all.\"</p><p>The company plans to use proceeds from the deal to export its battery-swapping infrastructure and other technology to China, India and parts of Southeast Asia.</p><p>Later this year, Gogoro plans to begin providing battery-swapping infrastructure for a range of two-wheel vehicles being developed in China by motorcycle maker Dachangjiang Group and Yadea Group, one of the world's top manufacturers of electric scooters.</p><p>It also has plans with Hero MotoCorp, the world's largest maker of motorcycles and scooters, to develop a Hero-brand electric vehicle and build a network of battery-swapping stations in India.</p><p>Gogoro reported revenue of about $364 million last year. It expects that to rise to $500 million next year and $1.7 billion in 2024 as its tie-ups in China and India take shape. Its debt stood at about $518 million at the end of June, the company said.</p><p>Poema is affiliated with Princeville Capital, a climate- and technology-focused growth-equity firm that counts actor Leonardo DiCaprio among its advisers and investors.</p><p>Write to Ben Otto at ben.otto@wsj.com</p><p>Taiwan Battery-Swapping Pioneer Gogoro to Go Public in SPAC Merger</p>",
