  "title": "Phil Knight Makes Offer for Portland Trail Blazers—Who Say They Aren't for Sale; The NBA team has been overseen by a trust since the 2018 death of longtime owner Paul Allen",
  "text": "<p>ESPN reported on Thursday that Knight and Los Angeles Dodgers co-owner Alan Smolinisky made a more than $2 billion offer to buy the Blazers and had been engaged in discussions with the Allen trust.</p><p>The Dodgers and Nike didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. An NBA spokesman declined to comment.</p><p>Knight, whose net worth Forbes estimates at more than $50 billion, has never owned a professional team, despite his deep involvement in sports through the company he co-founded half a century ago with former University of Oregon track coach Bill Bowerman.</p><p>Knight, 84, has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to Oregon, where he competed as a college runner. His lead gifts for buildings have helped transform the school's athletic campus into one of the most advanced in the nation.</p><p>Smolinisky bought a stake in the Dodgers in 2019 along with several other investors, including former NBA star Magic Johnson. It isn't clear how large a stake in the team Smolinisky owns.</p><p>NBA franchise values have risen along with the league's broadcast-rights deals and overall popularity. The NBA's current broadcast-rights deal with ESPN and TNT is worth nearly $2.7 billion a year and runs through 2025.</p><p>A $2 billion-plus price tag would roughly match the 2014 sale of the Los Angeles Clippers to former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer for $2 billion. In 2017, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founder Joseph Tsai bought a 49% stake in the Brooklyn Nets at a record valuation of $2.3 billion. Last year, former Major League Baseball star Alex Rodriguez and billionaire entrepreneur Marc Lore reached a deal to buy the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves and the WNBA's Minnesota Lynx for $1.5 billion.</p><p>The Trail Blazers are a smaller-market team, although the franchise has a history of strong fan support in a city whose only other significant pro sports teams are in Major League Soccer and the National Women's Soccer League.</p><p>Being acquired by a local owner like Knight could protect the Blazers, who were founded in Portland in 1970, from being moved one day.</p><p>Write to Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com</p><p>Phil Knight Makes Offer for Portland Trail Blazers—Who Say They Aren't for Sale</p>",
