  "title": "U.S. News:  Gates Foundation  Reveals Leader Plan  ----  By Betsy McKay and Emily Glazer",
  "text": "<p>   The Gates Foundation said that Melinda French Gates eventually could depart from its leadership if she and Bill Gates determine they can't work together, as the philanthropy laid out plans for its future oversight. </p><p>   The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation said Wednesday that it would add trustees and that its controlling philanthropists will add an additional $15 billion to the foundation's $49.9 billion endowment, their largest single contribution since 2000. The money will be used to fund grants across the foundation's work on issues including infectious diseases, gender equality and U.S. education, Mark Suzman, the foundation's chief executive officer, said in an interview. </p><p>   Under a private agreement that is part of their planned divorce, Ms. French Gates would resign as co-chair and trustee if after two years either of the co-chairs decides they can no longer work together to lead the foundation, Mr. Suzman said. Should that happen, he said, Ms. French Gates would receive funds from Mr. Gates separate from the foundation's endowment for her own philanthropic work. </p><p>   Ms. French Gates has discussed for at least several weeks the possibility of leaving the foundation if joint leadership with Mr. Gates isn't tenable, people familiar with the matter said. She has been spending more time on work through her firm Pivotal Ventures, while maintaining her work at the foundation, the people said. </p><p>   The foundation disclosed the arrangement because it is relevant to additional trustees that the organization plans to bring on, Mr. Suzman said. It doesn't signal Ms. French Gates's impending departure, he said. \"Bill and Melinda have both individually and together assured me of their firm intent to keep working together as long-term co-chairs of the foundation,\" he said. </p><p>   Ms. French Gates confirmed that she remains dedicated to the organization. \"I believe deeply in the foundation's mission and remain fully committed as co-chair to its work,\" she said. </p><p>   The two recently approved multiyear spending plans for polio eradication, Mr. Suzman said, a priority for Mr. Gates, as well as a five-year, $2.1 billion commitment to advance gender equality, a priority for Ms. French Gates. </p><p>   Mr. Gates and Ms. French Gates also have been discussing reshaping the structure of the foundation, a family charitable trust, to enhance governance and independence as their planned divorce called its direction into question, The Wall Street Journal reported in May. The resignation of Warren Buffett, a major donor to the foundation, as a trustee left the two as the sole trustees, as well as co-chairs. </p><p>   Expanding the number of trustees would add diverse views and expertise to a charitable organization whose work \"has evolved to include some of the most complex and urgent challenges the world faces,\" Mr. Suzman said in a letter to foundation employees, who number more than 1,700 in Seattle and across Africa, Asia and Europe. </p><p>   Mr. Gates and Ms. French Gates said that the funding and governance changes don't alter their foundation's focus on fighting poverty, disease and inequity around the world. </p><p>   Mr. Gates and Ms. French Gates will work with foundation executives to select new trustees and define their responsibilities by the end of this year, and announce them in January 2022, Mr. Suzman said. </p><p>   Most large philanthropies have boards that advise or help run them. The Ford Foundation has a board of trustees with 14 members, while the Lilly Endowment has a board of directors with 11 members, according to the websites of both private foundations. </p><p></p>",
