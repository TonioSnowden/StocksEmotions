  "text": "<p>In Spain it has triggered legal action. In Canada it has riled office workers. In Australia it has rattled civil servants and in Britain it is irking union leaders.</p> <p>The cause of this far-flung frustration? The steady spread of hot-desking in a pandemic that threatens to turn the personal, assigned desk into an ever rarer commodity.</p> <p>Hot or shared desks have been high on worker hate lists ever since they began their insidious slide into corporate life more than 20 years ago. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, people disliked the tedium of racing their colleagues to find a desk that needed adjusting and made you feel like a worthless cog. </p> <p>Not much has changed. Last week, when a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=riva%20gold%20hot%20desk&amp;origin=GLOBAL_SEARCH_HEADER&amp;sid=rIs\">LinkedIn poll </a>asked if people enjoyed hot-desking at work, 75 per cent of respondents clicked on “no”.&#xa0;</p> <p>An even larger share of British office workers expressed the same view last year in a <a href=\"https://www.leeds.ac.uk/news-business-economy/news/article/4934/flexible-working-revolution-remains-a-work-in-progress\">university study </a>that also suggested the idea that people grow to like hot-desking over time is rubbish.</p> <p>Yet demand for “flexible working spaces” is on a roll. A <a href=\"https://www.jll.co.uk/en/trends-and-insights/research/perspectives-for-enterprises-2022\">report </a>this month from the JLL property group says 37 per cent of organisations globally have post-pandemic plans to increase their use of co-working or flexible space.</p> <p>Some have already started. Envoy, a software group that makes <a href=\"https://envoy.com/products/hot-desk-booking-software/\">an app </a>you can use to book a hot desk, says desk reservations jumped by as much as 60 per cent a month last year.</p> <p>You might ask why employers would introduce such a proven agent of misery at a time of <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10240085/Dishwashers-90-hour-amid-labour-shortage-Australian-hospitality-sector-post-Covid-lockdown.html\">chronic worker </a>shortages from <a href=\"https://abc7news.com/worker-shortage-employee-small-business-survival-pandemic/11302346/\">San Francisco </a>to <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/workplace/worker-drought-job-ads-soar-but-no-one-s-applying-20211110-p597sh.html\">Sydney.</a> Yet even a life-long loather of the hot desk like me can see why it is happening.</p> <p>Before Covid, office property in big cities was so expensive that underused space cost companies an estimated <a href=\"https://abintra-consulting.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Abintra-Report-6.pdf\">£4bn a year </a>in London alone.</p> <p>Now, those same businesses are introducing hybrid working so people can work some days at home and some in the office, which is precisely what most employees say they <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/its-time-for-leaders-to-get-real-about-hybrid\">want</a>.</p> <p>But if much of a workforce is only coming into the office two or three days a week, it makes for a lot of underused space. Enter the hot desk, with predictable results.</p> <p>A Spanish company that tried desk-sharing ended up in court last year after <a href=\"https://elpais.com/economia/2021-09-02/la-audiencia-nacional-avala-las-mesas-calientes-en-las-empresas.html\">unions objected</a> to what they argued was a serious change in working conditions.</p> <p>That claim was rejected but it may not be the last.</p> <p>Employees in Canada are <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-the-great-divide-over-over-hot-desking-while-companies-see-cost/\">reportedly </a>miffed about returning to work to find they have to use an app to book a hot desk in hybrid work set-ups. The same prospect has upset government workers <a href=\"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/7505135/agriculture-staff-to-book-seats-under-new-hot-desking-plans/\">in Canberra</a>. In London, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ecdb64f9-5491-4e28-80f3-d74562191f34\">union bosses say </a>hot-desking has undermined ministers' edicts for civil servants to go back to the office because there are now fewer desks than staff.</p> <p>I sympathise. Pre-pandemic, too much hot-desking was done by mindless cost-cutters who ignored the price of alienating and wasting the time of staff.</p> <p>But Covid has made me think again. First, because the rise of remote working makes the cost of unused office space a bigger problem.</p> <p>Also, when I have returned to my old, assigned Financial Times desk between lockdowns, the experience has not always been ideal. </p> <p>My area has sometimes been so devoid of bodies I may as well have stayed home. At times I voluntarily hot-desked, just to be closer to colleagues who were the main reason I was there. Admittedly, my desk is in an especially distant wing of the building. But in a hybrid set-up, I can see this could be a common dilemma.</p> <p>There is an answer, of sorts. If shared desks, and chairs, are easily adjustable, simple to reserve, close to generous storage space and generally better organised, hot-desking might become more popular. </p> <p>But it won't be cost-free. A desk of one's own is not merely more convenient and ergonomically sound. It is a sign that you are valued by, and belong to, an organisation. Once it goes, so does a measure of loyalty to the business.</p> <p>At a time when the pandemic has stretched organisational ties to once unthinkable lengths, I suspect it will still be best to keep the idea of the hot desk on ice for as long as possible.</p> <p><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=pilita.clark@ft.com\"><em>pilita.clark@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Twitter:</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pilitaclark\"><em>&#xa0;@pilitaclark</em></a><br></p><p>Source: Pilita Clark 2022 'We will pay for our hybrid work freedoms with more hot-desking' FT.com 30 January.
