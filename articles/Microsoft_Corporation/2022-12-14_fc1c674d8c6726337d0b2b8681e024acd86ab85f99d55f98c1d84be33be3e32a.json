  "text": "<p>Battery-recycling startup Redwood Materials Inc. is accelerating its U.S. investment, saying it plans to build a second factory in South Carolina.</p><p>The $3.5 billion plant will recycle spent lithium-ion batteries and manufacture anode and cathode components, Redwood Materials said, two of the most costly parts of the batteries that power electric vehicles. The company decided to build another plant in the South to better position itself to supply a flurry of battery plants going up to take advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act.</p><p>Chief Executive JB Straubel, a former chief technology officer at Tesla Inc., is betting that his Carson City, Nev., venture can become a major supplier to battery cell manufacturers.</p><p>Today, much of the raw materials and manufacturing that comprise the battery supply chain are based in Asia, particularly China. In August, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to accelerate development of the U.S. electric-car supply chain. The act has helped fuel a building boom by tying EV tax credits for consumers to how much battery material comes from domestic production and recycling or from U.S. trade partners.</p><p>The Inflation Reduction Act \"is bringing a ton of additional cell manufacturing to the U.S.,\" Mr. Straubel said. \"I'd say this has gently shifted our priorities to really accelerate investment in the U.S. a little bit ahead of looking overseas.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How might Redwood Materials' expanded manufacturing affect the electric-vehicle industry in the U.S.? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Redwood Materials said Wednesday that the latest facility will be located outside Charleston, S.C., in what the company called the battery belt, a constellation of battery plants from Michigan down to Georgia. As of October, those planned investments in battery manufacturing exceeded $40 billion, according to researchers for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.</p><p>The company said it would pull back on spending at a planned Nevada plant, which it announced in July. At the time, Redwood Materials said it would spend $3.5 billion on the plant near Reno but has since reduced that amount to around $1.1 billion so it can focus cash on the battery belt. A spokeswoman for Redwood Materials said different factors led to the shift in the company's spending plans, including the types of incentives offered by each state and the proximity to customers.</p><p>The company said it expected the South Carolina plant will start recycling batteries by the end of next year and build out the manufacturing operation over the next decade with an aim to produce enough cathode and anode materials to power over one million EVs a year. Redwood Materials is currently using a facility in Nevada to recycle battery materials and manufacture copper foil, a component in anodes.</p><p>The company isn't yet making cathodes. A planned tie-up between Redwood Materials and South Korea's L&amp;F Co. to employ the latter's cathode manufacturing technology is under discussion, as the two sides try to satisfy concerns about technology transfers raised by the South Korean government, Mr. Straubel said. \"We have, I'd say you know, slowed that down a little bit while we make sure we address some of the concerns,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Straubel said he couldn't predict when those concerns would be satisfied. \"Some of this is kind of geopolitical in nature,\" he said.</p><p>Tensions have grown between the U.S. and South Korean governments over the Biden administration's efforts to bring more of the electric vehicle manufacturing supply chain to the U.S. A change to EV tax credits to favor locally produced vehicles disqualified vehicles made by some auto makers, including South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Corp.</p><p>Another reason Redwood Materials picked South Carolina was the port of Charleston. Mr. Straubel said the company needed to import raw materials for its manufacturing business because there isn't enough recyclable materials to feed the growing EV manufacturing business. He said recycled materials will eventually account for 40% to 60% of the parts Redwood Materials will manufacture.</p><p>Mr. Straubel said he believes Redwood Materials would also export products to manufacturers overseas, in part because of the construction boom following the IRA.</p><p>\"I think it's shocking,\" Mr. Straubel said. \"In just a few months post-IRA, we've seen tens of billions of dollars of manufacturing plans that have been redirected toward the U.S.\"</p><p>Write to Sean McLain at sean.mclain@wsj.com</p><p>Tranisition to Electric Vehicles</p><p>* Microsoft Invests in Silicon-Battery Material Upstart (Dec. 14)</p><p>* Lamborghini Looks to the Past as It Plans an EV Future (Dec. 12)</p><p>* Jay Leno on Electric Cars, Hydrogen Fuel, Space Travelâ€”and His Recent Accident (Dec. 11)</p><p>* EV-Maker VinFast Shifts Into Gear for U.S. IPO (Dec. 7)</p><p>Redwood Materials to Build Second Battery-Parts Factory in South Carolina</p>",
