  "title": "November Employment Report Shows U.S. Economy Added 263,000 Jobs; Jobless rate remains at 3.7%, signaling continued strength in the labor market",
  "text": "<p>The jobless rate remained at 3.7% last month, a historically low level that is pushing up wages. Average hourly earnings grew 5.1% in November from a year earlier, holding well above the prepandemic pace of roughly 3%. One reason employers might continue to raise wages briskly: Labor-force participation remains below prepandemic levels and ticked down last month.</p><p>Low unemployment and wage gains are helping fuel consumer spending, the economy's main engine, but also pressuring inflation that is running close to a four-decade high. Federal Reserve officials have said that they are likely to lift rates to and hold them at levels high enough to slow economic activity and hiring to bring inflation down.</p><p>The jobs report keeps the central bank on track to raise interest rates in two weeks by a half percentage point, which would bring the benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 4.25% and 4.5%.</p><p>One big question is how long the labor market's strength can last as the Fed raises interest rates. In November, payrolls grew in leisure and hospitality, healthcare and government. The information sector—which includes many tech jobs—also hired workers at a healthy clip.</p><p>But cracks are emerging. Some companies in technology, entertainment and real estate are shedding workers, with many growing nervous about the economic outlook. Firms in retail and warehousing are cutting jobs this holiday season as consumers shift their spending from goods to services like restaurants.</p><p>Economists are concerned that higher interest rates will trigger more widespread layoffs and a recession in the next year, as has typically occurred during prior episodes of fast rate rises. They are closely monitoring the pace of hiring for early signs of shifts in labor-market momentum.</p><p>\"An employer is going to start reducing hiring long before they start letting go of their existing workforce,\" said Guy Berger, principal economist at LinkedIn. \"That's the first lever.\"</p><p>Rising unemployment could follow, he said, as job seekers have fewer available opportunities. Continuing claims, which reflect the number of people seeking ongoing unemployment benefits, are drifting upward in a sign of labor-market cooling, Mr. Berger said.</p><p>This week, CNN said it was laying off employees and DoorDash Inc. said it would trim its corporate staffing levels by about 1,250. AMC Networks Inc. said in a memo to employees that it plans to lay off about 20% of its U.S. workforce.</p><p>Corporate layoff announcements generally have been concentrated in the technology industry and sectors of the economy sensitive to interest rates such as housing and finance. Other businesses are quickly scooping up laid-off workers as job openings remain well above prepandemic levels, even in sectors such as real estate.</p><p>LodeStar Software Solutions, a small software company that helps mortgage lenders accurately disclose fees to consumers, recently posted an opening for a customer-service role, said Jim Paolino, chief executive of the Conshohocken, Pa.-based company.</p><p>Mr. Paolino quickly received about 130 résumés for the job, which entails account management. He held screening calls with 10 applicants, eight of whom had lost their jobs at mortgage companies.</p><p>\"It's actually a great time to hire right now,\" he said. \"There has been an influx of talent in our industry and to the market because a lot of larger companies have done pretty large-scale layoffs.\"</p><p>Companies are still largely avoiding job cuts because demand for goods and services is solid. Personal spending increased 0.8% from the prior month, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</p><p>Some firms also are hesitant to lay off employees because they found it so difficult to rehire as the economy recovered from the pandemic downturn.</p><p>\"Demand restarted, and they couldn't hire fast enough,\" said Becky Frankiewicz, president and chief commercial officer of staffing firm ManpowerGroup. \"There's still this aftershock of, 'I want to hold on to the talent that I have.'\"</p><p>Companies are still offering hiring bonuses to attract talent, but the rationale has shifted some from a year ago. Employers are expecting inflation to come down and bonuses give them more flexibility to dial back compensation than wage increases do, she said.</p><p>\"If you still have a talent shortage and you don't want to lock in at higher wages across all your roles, what do you do? You do bonuses,\" Ms. Frankiewicz said.</p><p>Wage growth has cooled in recent months but remains above the prepandemic pace.</p><p>Still, there are signs that spending could be reaching a limit, with some Americans dipping into savings or taking on credit-card debt to finance purchases. The personal-saving rate was 2.3% in October, its lowest level since 2.1% in July 2005.</p><p>David Blake, president of Iowa-based Blue-9 Pet Products, said sales have been roughly flat this year, a shift from previous years when the 10-person manufacturer and seller of dog-training accessories posted double-digit sales growth.</p><p>Pet owners appear to be cutting back on some discretionary purchases as they face higher prices for staples such as groceries, he said.</p><p>\"Whether we're in a recession or going to have a recession or not, the fact still remains that the inflation out there is having an impact on spending,\" said Mr. Blake.</p><p>Due to slower sales, Mr. Blake held off on hiring new employees this year. He also doesn't plan to add any next year.</p><p>—Gabriel T.
