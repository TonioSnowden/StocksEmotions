A more than 50 per cent fall in the price of bitcoin since mid-April reveals a <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Bitcoin-stumbles-below-30-000-under-weight-of-China-crackdown\">deep sense of alarm</a> in the cryptocurrency sector over a crackdown by China and other governments.</p> <p>China's largest bitcoin producing provinces are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7526f514-9f36-4dbb-94ee-beb061f5cc52\">intensifying a campaign</a> to shut down cryptocurrency mining operations. Sichuan, a hydropower-rich province in south-western China, has ordered the 26 largest local mines to stop operating.</p> <p><strong>Key implications</strong>: “Globally we are seeing a much more forceful crackdown on crypto by governments,” analysts at QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto trading company, wrote in a note.</p> <p>US authorities are also taking a closer look at cryptocurrencies. Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler called <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39718cda-5cd1-4f0d-b7e3-0151e45bf25b\">last month</a> for “greater investor protections” in the crypto market.</p> <p>Earlier this month, global regulators called for digital currencies to carry the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3fe7be31-179a-47dd-9a61-8f4ea42b9c62\">toughest bank capital rules</a> of any asset, with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision warning that the growing use of crypto assets “has the potential to raise financial stability concerns”.</p> <p><strong>Upshot</strong>: All the signs are that China, which is scaling up tests of its official digital renminbi, is serious about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8ea05b1-f0de-4af9-b337-ba42dda6ae6e\">stamping out</a> the crypto industry on its soil. In other countries, the approach is likely to be more gradual and based on regulatory initiatives.</p> <h2>Mercedes' top 10</h2> <ol>  <li><p>In this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4bcaf594-4618-4dcf-874a-52b882f9f9fb\">new season</a> of the wonderful Tech Tonic podcast, John Thornhill asks: is AI going to work for us, or might it run amok?

(Nikkei Asia)</p></li> </ol> <h2>Our take </h2> <p>Last Thursday, Shenzhou-12, or “divine vessel” in Chinese, took three astronauts to space. The launch was televised live from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in China's north-western Gobi desert. To me, this illustrates increasing confidence, especially compared with China's first manned space launch, from the same location, almost 18 years ago.</p> <p>In October 2003, I was in the city of Jiuquan to get a sense of this historic moment. The space centre, though it carries the same name, is over 200km away and was off-limits to foreigners. This was the closest I could get. No foreign journalists were invited to the facility for the launch, and moreover, there was no live broadcast. The successful launch of Shenzhou-5 was reported by state-owned media half an hour later.</p> <p>But last week, an NBC reporter was on-site and performing interviews with engineers and staff. This was unthinkable almost 18 years ago. Back then, Beijing was afraid to go live because of fear of failure, and it felt unprepared to show off its space centre infrastructure to foreign media.</p> <p>Six-and-a-half hours after lift-off last week, the three taikonauts successfully docked with the maiden space station Tiangong (“heavenly palace”). Given that the US-led multinational International Space Station is currently scheduled to be decommissioned without a successor in 2024, China will then be the only country to own and control such a facility.</p> <p><em>— Kenji</em></p> <h2>Smart data</h2> <p>Which company is bigger than <strong>Uber</strong>, <strong>Coinbase</strong> and <strong>Sony</strong> and recently overtook <strong>SoftBank</strong>? That would be <strong>Sea</strong>, the south-east Asian gaming and ecommerce company listed in New York.</p> <p>The group, already the most valuable public company in south-east Asia, saw its <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Sea-tops-SoftBank-in-market-cap-amid-Latin-America-expansion\">share price soar last week</a>, giving it a market capitalisation of about $148bn. In doing so, it topped Japan's SoftBank Group, which is valued at about $122bn.</p> <p>Headquartered in Singapore, Sea focuses primarily on south-east Asia and Taiwan, but is increasingly engaging in Latin America. Nevertheless, Sea is still heavily lossmaking: net losses widened to $1.62bn in 2020 despite its revenue and gross profits doubling over the same period. </p> <h2>Spotlight</h2> <p>When Kotaro Sawada took over running Japan's <strong>Zozo</strong> in 2019 from colourful founder Yusaku Maezawa, some critics thought the company would lose its edge. </p> <p>Maezawa was marketing svengali. The billionaire entrepreneur was known for celebrity romances, skipping college to play in a punk rock band and the Zozosuit, a skintight black bodysuit covered in white dots.</p> <p>But Sawada is replacing flamboyance with unflashy attention to detail. “<a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Retail/Japan-apparel-platform-Zozo-merges-fine-fashion-with-high-tech\">I'm not a charismatic manager</a>,” Sawada says. The approach appears to be paying off. In the fiscal year ended March 2021, the value of merchandise transactions increased 22 per cent from the previous year, reaching a record of ¥419.4bn ($3.8bn).</p> <h2>Art of the deal</h2> <p><strong>SenseTime</strong>, the Chinese artificial intelligence start-up, is mulling another run at a public listing that could raise up to $2bn. The <strong>Alibaba</strong>-backed company is planning to sell shares first in Hong Kong and is working with advisers to finalise&#xa0;a listing application, <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/Chinese-AI-startup-SenseTime-resumes-push-for-2bn-Hong-Kong-IPO\">according to a Nikkei scoop</a>.</p> <p>SenseTime was one of the leading Chinese AI groups to be hit by a US blacklisting in 2019, which derailed its previous IPO timeline. Despite being added to the US entity list, SenseTime has raised capital from global investors and won overseas contracts in countries including Japan and Thailand. In January, Chinese media reported that&#xa0;SenseTime agreed on fundraising terms that valued the company at $12bn.</p><p>Source: Mercedes Ruehl, Kenji Kawase and James Kynge 2021 'Has the death knell sounded for cryptocurrencies?
