  "title": "Freshworks Shouldn't Spoil on Delivery; Cloud-software company's IPO should stand out for its reasonable valuation and path to profitability",
  "text": "<p>That might seem generous for a business generating just over $300 million in annual revenue, but a multiple just over 30 times trailing sales looks almost grounded for this sector; at least seven large cloud-software IPOs over the past 12 months began trading at higher multiples, according to FactSet data.</p><p>Investors have developed a strong appetite for software IPOs. According to Dealogic, 86 software companies have gone public in the U.S. market so far this year compared with 57 during all of 2020. Fourteen of those this year have raised $1 billion or more compared with 10 last year and five the year before.</p><p>The enthusiasm makes sense given sustained interest by investors in the sector. The BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index has jumped 49% over the past 12 months, outperforming the broader market and every other tech subsector save for chips—an industry benefiting from booming demand sparked by a production shortage.</p><p>That sets a good stage for Freshworks. Its software helps companies to run customer service operations, internal services such as help desks and sales and marketing functions. That would seem to make for a long list of formidable competitors such as Salesforce.com, ServiceNow, Oracle and even software titan Microsoft. But Freshworks' focus on small and midsize businesses helps it stay under the radar of those that constantly have to sign bigger customers to much bigger deals to keep up with their own growth targets.</p><p>The company's revenue has averaged 49% growth on a year-over-year basis over the past four quarters, with its pace accelerating to 56% in the most recent period. The quarter ended June 30 also brought its trailing 12-month revenue past the $300 million mark. Freshworks' software services are proving to be sticky, with 1,164 customers generating more than $50,000 each in annualized revenue at the end of June—up 32% from just six months prior.</p><p>The company also has an advantage in coming from a growing cluster of cloud-software companies in India. Much of Freshworks' sales, engineering and product-development operations remain in that country, giving it a cost advantage. Mark Moerdler of Bernstein Research estimates that an account executive based in India costs about 75% less on average than one in the U.S. Freshworks still generates operating losses, but told investors in its roadshow video that it expects to reach operating margins in the 10% range in the intermediate term and 20% to 25% in the long term.</p><p>A profitable cloud-software company would be a tasty prospect indeed.</p><p>Freshworks Shouldn't Spoil on Delivery</p>",
