  "title": "World News: War Drives EU Energy-Efficiency Push --- To reduce dependence on Russian oil, nations accelerate changes to power systems",
  "text": "<p>A proposal from the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, last month urged lawmakers to set a higher target for saving energy, aiming to cut a key source of revenue for the Russian government under President Vladimir Putin. The commission said the bloc should aim for 13% in energy savings by 2030 compared with projections, up from a previous target of 9%.</p><p>\"You can wonder what is more unrealistic: to have an ambitious approach on energy efficiency or keep being dependent on Putin's gas and oil,\" said Niels Fuglsang, a Danish member of the European Parliament who is leading negotiations on the energy-efficiency legislation.</p><p>Avoiding aggressive steps to escape dependence on Russia in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine \"is certainly not a realistic option,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Fuglsang is pushing for a savings target of 19% -- equivalent to the energy contained in 214 million metric tons of oil, or around 40% of the oil that U.S. cars and trucks consume each year.</p><p>Enacting such changes across the continent will require significant investment in building renovations coupled with hefty government support. So far, the EU's 27 national governments haven't put nearly enough money on the table, according to environmental groups and some officials.</p><p>\"The challenge we have with efficiency solutions and with renovation is that we're looking at many small-scale projects,\" said Oliver Rapf, executive director of Buildings Performance Institute Europe, a think tank. \"It's not as simple as saying, 'OK, we're going to put out a wind farm somewhere in the North Sea,' and it's up and running in three years.\"</p><p>In France, the government has set a target of renovating by 2050 all the country's buildings to a high standard of efficiency -- around 300,000 comprehensive renovations in 2022 alone. But renovations are only running at around 60,000 a year, said Jacques Baudrier, a city councilor in Paris who oversees the city's energy-efficiency efforts.</p><p>The state has set aside around 3 billion euros a year, equivalent to $3.2 billion, to help homeowners make the required investments. Mr. Baudrier said hitting the target will require the government to spend 23 billion euros a year.</p><p>\"It is completely insufficient to renovate all the housing of France,\" Mr. Baudrier said. \"The money is allowing for small renovations but few comprehensive renovations.\"</p><p>Achieving France's high-efficiency target would likely require installing energy-saving windows, new insulation for walls and roofs and often an electric heat pump -- work that costs tens of thousands of euros even for a small apartment, Mr. Baudrier said.</p><p>Paris in July will announce an increase in subsidies for homeowners to renovate their apartments -- from the capital's famed 19th-century Haussmannian stone buildings to 1960s-era brick buildings that are among the capital's least energy-efficient. Parisian homeowners are completing only around 2,000 comprehensive renovations a year, while France's targets call for 40,000 annually, Mr. Baudrier said.</p><p>France, like some other European countries, has reacted to surging energy costs by capping or freezing retail electricity and gas prices. That has removed some of the incentive for consumers to renovate buildings and consume less, according to environmental groups. They have said government support should be delivered in other ways, such as lump-sum payments, which don't affect the price.</p><p>\"We do think that gas caps are hiding the reality of the social and environmental costs of gas,\" said Davide Sabbadin, senior policy officer at the European Environmental Bureau, an umbrella organization of the region's environmental groups.</p><p>A big part of Europe's efficiency campaign is switching the continent from gas to electric heat.</p><p>France said it would boost a subsidy for new electric-heat-pump installations and end subsidies for newer gas boilers. The Netherlands has said it plans to make hybrid heat pumps -- which combine an electric heat pump with a gas boiler -- or other efficient heating systems mandatory for new installations beginning in 2026.</p><p>Europe had a total stock of about 17 million heat pumps at the end of 2021 with another 2.5 million installations estimated for this year, according to the European Heat Pump Association. The International Energy Agency has said that doubling the current pace of heat-pump installation in Europe could save about 2 billion cubic meters of gas in the first year -- or 1.3% of the amount the EU imported from Russia in 2021.</p><p>Mitsubishi Electric Corp. has said it is expanding its heating, ventilation and air-conditioning business with a focus on heat pumps aimed at the European market. Daikin Europe NV, a subsidiary of Daikin Industries Ltd., recently added a new heat-pump production line at its factory in Belgium and says it is planning a further expansion at the site before next summer.</p><p>Some cities and towns are turning to Big Tech to cut gas consumption. Microsoft Corp. said in March that it would build a data center in southern Finland and capture the excess heat for the city of Espoo and nearby municipalities.</p><p>In Denmark, Apple Inc. said in March that it would capture the excess heat from a new data center it built near Viborg for use in the town's district heating system, which is currently powered by natural gas. Apple is building two of the world's largest onshore wind turbines to help power the center and can tap carbon-free hydropower imported from the north.</p><p>The surge in natural-gas prices over the past year delivered a shock to the town's 40,000 residents, said Kristian Brons Nielsen, chairman of the town's heating company.</p><p>\"It's gone totally crazy; we have to send out extra bills for the customers,\" Mr. Nielsen said. \"We decided to speed up the process. . .now people say, 'Can we get it tomorrow?'\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
