  "text": "<p>Instead, they paused negotiations and will convene later Tuesday morning for a ninth consecutive day at a spring-training stadium here, maintaining hope that they can still salvage opening day on March 31. The MLB-imposed deadline now is 5 p.m. Tuesday. The union has viewed the league's threat as little more than a pressure tactic.</p><p>\"We want to exhaust every possibility to get a deal done,\" a MLB spokesman said.</p><p>In some areas, the sides appeared to arrive at a consensus. They both seem comfortable with expanding the postseason field to 12 participants from 10, though the league had been asking for 14, a person familiar with the matter said. MLB has also expressed a willingness to keep the luxury-tax rates from the previous agreement rather than raise them.</p><p>But there are at least three significant economic issues still in flux that will determine whether the owners and players make a deal Tuesday. Perhaps the thorniest pertains to the luxury tax, which penalizes teams whose payroll exceeds thresholds. MLB proposed having the tax kick in at payrolls of $220 million, up from $210 million in 2021, and climbing to $230 million in 2026. The union is seeking a higher threshold.</p><p>The others involve two mechanisms designed to increase compensation for young players, one of the union's top priorities in these negotiations. The league proposed raising the minimum salary to $675,000 from $570,500, going up by $10,000 in each year of the CBA. It has also offered to put $25 million into a performance-based bonus pool for players who don't yet qualify for salary arbitration. That would benefit stars like New York Mets first baseman Pete Alonso, who made more money last year from winning the Home Run Derby ($1 million) than he did in salary ($676,775). The players are looking for more in both areas.</p><p>Before Monday, the sides had met for seven straight days with only minimal progress on the economic issues at the core of the dispute. The gridlock stoked fears that games would be missed because of a work stoppage for the first time since 1994, when a strike ended the season in August and resulted in the cancellation of the World Series.</p><p>The urgency intensified Monday into Tuesday, with the sides having 13 face-to-face meetings, including two featuring Commissioner Rob Manfred and MLB Players Association executive director Tony Clark directly. The bargaining efforts have been led by deputy commissioner Dan Halem and union lawyer Bruce Meyer. Manfred said in February that delaying the season would be \"a disastrous outcome for this industry.\"</p><p>For Manfred, the stakes are high. He oversaw an abbreviated season in 2020, when MLB and the union clashed over the economics of staging games without fans in attendance because of the pandemic. The parties never struck a deal and Manfred imposed a 60-game campaign, prompting a union grievance worth around $500 million alleging that MLB intentionally scheduled fewer games than possible to avoid paying players.</p><p>A second shortened season caused by labor unrest could be devastating for Manfred's legacy. He likes to fashion himself as a deal maker, an expert labor attorney who helped deliver four other CBAs without a work stoppage. The lockout has put that reputation at risk. The embattled commissioner is still reeling from the fallout of the Houston Astros sign-stealing scandal, among other controversies during his tenure.</p><p>Players are pushing for significant changes to baseball's economic structure, contributing to the stalemate that has management ready to call off games. They want better pay for young players, an increasingly crucial part of rosters who make close to the MLB minimum. They want a less onerous luxury tax, which the union believes has been used as a de facto salary cap. And they want rules to inspire competition from teams and reduce the incentive to pursue the rebuilding strategy known as \"tanking.\"</p><p>The owners have a considerably shorter list. They want to expand the postseason. They want to increase profits by putting advertisements on uniforms, as the NBA does. Most of all, they want to protect a financial system that has benefited themâ€”and are willing to take down games to achieve that goal. The last CBA was widely viewed as having favored the owners, and the average player salary decreased over the life of the deal.</p><p>The players are emboldened and have only become more entrenched as the rhetoric has grown more heated. Many took to social media to express their frustrations Monday, some with creative flair. New York Yankees outfielder Joey Gallo created a LinkedIn page, listing his skills as \"striking out,\" \"hitting into the shift\" and \"getting dressed weird.\" Philadelphia Phillies star Bryce Harper posted to Instagram an edited photograph of himself wearing the uniform of the Yomiuri Giants, a Japanese professional team.</p><p>They and their counterparts around the sport will have to wait another day to find out whether their season will start on time.</p><p>Write to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com</p><p>MLB Extends Deadline, Keeping Opening-Day Hopes Alive</p>",
