  "text": "<p>More than a century ago, when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller\">US oil tycoon John D Rockefeller</a> sought to create his tax exempt foundation that has since tackled disease, poor nutrition and discrimination around the world, he faced widespread resistance, from the White House to Britain's literary salons.</p> <p>Theodore Roosevelt said “no amount of charity in spending such fortunes can compensate in any way for the misconduct in acquiring them”. The novelist GK Chesterton compared Rockefeller to the medieval “bad barons” who sought to whitewash the memory of their raids by donating land to the church.</p> <p>As Beth Breeze describes in her spirited <em>In Defence of Philanthropy</em>, Rockefeller and his fellow “robber baron” Andrew Carnegie were just two of the more prominent donors throughout history who have faced scepticism about their motives and criticism of their actions.</p> <p>Ever since philanthropy was articulated in the fifth century BC in the Greek myth Prometheus Bound, suspicion of gifts to humankind from the “gods” has been a recurrent theme. In the early Middle Ages, the Venerable Bede warned of “the injustice of gifts to the poor being made from wealth derived from the exploitation of those who then stood in need of charity”. In fiction, authors from Ralph Waldo Emerson to Charles Dickens have mocked and parodied the givers.</p> <p>Breeze, director of the Centre for Philanthropy at the University of Kent, who draws on her background as a charity fundraiser, adviser and academic, suggests most contemporary critiques are skewed and add nothing new. But her core argument is that — from sniping on social media to more substantial books such as Anand Giridharadas' <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/64d70736-0212-11e9-9d01-cd4d49afbbe3\"><em>Winners Take All</em></a> — the intensity of the polemic has increased and the tone has become relentlessly negative, bringing with it the risk that philanthropists are deterred and stop giving.</p> <p>She identifies and seeks to demolish three critiques: the academic, which claims that philanthropists seek to entrench unequal power and exacerbate inequality rather than solving societal problems; the insider, suggesting donors' gifts and priorities are misdirected to the wrong causes; and the populist, which questions their underlying motives, sometimes with ad hominem attacks. </p> <p>Breeze points out that criticism of philanthropy is often conflated with criticism of wealth and the methods of its acquisition. Despite tax concessions afforded to charitable gifts, philanthropists still make a positive contribution — both in providing net cash from their own pockets and spending it in more positive ways than on yachts or other personal indulgences. </p> <p>They have often catalysed reforms only belatedly or partially taken up by government — from the public baths in Ancient Rome to access to education for the poor, the abolition of slavery and child labour, or the reconstruction of Notre-Dame. </p> <p>She points out that while some donors may be more obsessed with self interest, social climbing and narcissism than social reform, others — such as those aligned behind groups such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76f080cb-86cd-4c84-a80c-bcbc35ddb1df\">Millionaires for Humanity</a> and Patriotic Millionaires — call for higher taxes, a living wage and attacks on monopolistic behaviour or predatory business practices.</p> <p>Brass plaques and foundations designed to last in perpetuity may pander to some donors' egos, but others give in a more low profile way and sometimes lend their name only reluctantly to add credibility or to encourage others to give alongside them. </p> <p>A century ago, George Eastman, the founder of Kodak, distributed free shares to his employees, created pioneering progressive sick pay and pension arrangements, gave to MIT under a pseudonym and donated nearly all of his wealth during his lifetime. More recently, Chuck Feeney, the founder of airport retailer Duty Free Shoppers, channelled his $8bn fortune anonymously via <a href=\"https://www.atlanticphilanthropies.org/\">Atlantic Philanthropies</a>. </p> <p>Breeze also suggests the critique of misplaced use of resources is often unfair: people have different but legitimate views on society's greatest needs, and an excessive focus on “value for money” can come at the expense of underlying activities, such as basic research, that are more difficult to quantify. </p> <p>One academic book in 2015 cited a critic of Bill Gates that “it's a no-brainer that the major problem in the future is not infectious diseases”. Yet in that same year, the Microsoft co-founder warned of the dangers of the coming pandemic, and stepped up funding that helped foster the development in record time of new vaccines to protect against Covid-19.</p> <p>While she provides a powerful counterpoint, Breeze's own book has one important limitation, which is shared with much philanthropy: the lack of data. Even if attacks on donors have increased, she provides little evidence it has led to a fall in donations. </p> <p>Nor is there an attempt to quantify how donations are spent, which would help readers understand the extent of “good” versus “bad” practices. Breeze is certainly right that while philanthropy is improvable, it is not illegitimate. But it remains a legitimate target for rigorous scrutiny.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Defence-Philanthropy-Beth-Breeze/dp/1788212614/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1QHLAI5CISTHL&amp;keywords=In+Defence+of+Philanthropy&amp;qid=1636041956&amp;qsid=258-2019102-7798235&amp;sprefix=in+defence+of+philanthropy%2Caps%2C203&amp;sr=8-1&amp;sres=1788212614%2C1447325028%2C1013741048%2C1138650315%2C1850657378%2C0815347650%2C1681778645%2C1361739150&amp;srpt=ABIS_BOOK\"><strong>In Defence of Philanthropy</strong></a> by Beth Breeze.
