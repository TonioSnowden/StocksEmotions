  "title": "Canadian Tech Investor Georgian Targets $2.8 Billion for Two Funds; The firm hopes to collect $1.5 billion for follow-on investments in select companies from its core growth funds",
  "text": "<p>Ms. Zatoonian presented the investment opportunities at the Thursday public meeting of the Mass PRIM board of trustees, which pledged up to $100 million to the growth fund and $50 million to the Alignment fund.</p><p>Georgian's marketing pitch for the new Alignment fund comes months after it raised $1.02 billion for its first fund focused on the follow-on investment strategy. The strategy allows the firm to pre-empt and lead secret rounds of financing for companies with high growth potential rather than selling the stakes outright, Ms. Zatoonian said. The firm has raised at least five previous growth funds.</p><p>Georgian joins a growing list of technology investors pitching funds dedicated to providing follow-on capital to promising portfolio companies that they backed out of other funds. Earlier this year, for example, early-stage venture firm Lux Capital raised $800 million for Lux Total Opportunities LP to support some of the most promising startups in its portfolios.</p><p>Georgian was founded in 2008 by Justin LaFayette, Simon Chong and John Berton, and the firm was an early investor in e-commerce platform Shopify Inc., which went public in 2015.</p><p>Georgian, which defines itself as \"fintech for software companies,\" targets investments of between $25 million and $75 million in business-to-business software-as-a-service companies, typically ones that generate more than $500,000 in monthly recurring revenues, according to its website.</p><p>Georgian's recent investments include Israel-based OpenWeb Technologies Ltd., an online conversation platform. The firm also backed a $100 million financing round in March for existing portfolio company Xanadu Quantum Technologies Inc., a Canadian quantum computing company that it originally backed in 2019.</p><p>The growth firm also exited at least two portfolio companies this year. In November, New York-based real-estate technology company Scryer Inc., which does business as Reonomy, was acquired by publicly traded real-estate software provider Altus Group Ltd. for $201.5 million. In August, San Francisco-based cybersecurity portfolio company RiskIQ Inc. was acquired by Microsoft Corp.</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com</p>",
