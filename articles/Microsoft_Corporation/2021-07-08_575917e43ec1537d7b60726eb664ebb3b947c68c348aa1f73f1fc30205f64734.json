  "text": "<p>   President Biden outputs executive orders like a popcorn machine. His latest bucketful goes a long way toward clarifying the politics of our time. </p><p>   On June 25 Mr. Biden issued an order to \"advance diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) in the federal workforce.\" Meaning every nook they can find in American life. </p><p>   A phrase like \"diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility\" is what's known as a political narrative -- a brief, repeatable description of political goals whose implicit message is: Who could be against this? It is not an overstatement to say the future of the world will rise and fall on whether these pablum-like narratives can be turned into hard policy. </p><p>   \"Save the planet\" was one of the most successful. Rising alongside is DEI (\"accessibility\" is a Bidenized addition). Set aside the D- and I-words. The battle of our time is over the E-word -- equity. </p><p>   Unlike diversity and inclusion, both unmeasurable sentiments, equity is an economic concept. It posits that some have more economic wealth, and some have less. The \"some\" may be individuals or nations. Equity's goal is to impose policies by fiat intended to close \"disparities.\" </p><p>   The power of the equity narrative is that it can be applied to anything, insofar as most of life can be divided between more and less. Such as the Covid-19 pandemic. </p><p>   According to multiple recent news stories, the distribution of Covid vaccines has become an equity issue. \"After monopolizing initial production,\" the Washington Post asserts, \"rich nations have made only limited progress toward ensuring an equitable global distribution of vaccines.\" It says both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are warning of a \"two-track global recovery that would widen the economic divide between advanced and developing nations.\" </p><p>   \"Equity\" is wealth redistribution, or soft socialism, repackaged as happy talk. But this is a conversation worth having. Equity talk is an opportunity for clarification about which policies are pie in the sky and which work. </p><p>   Most useful to this exercise is that in Joe Biden we have a president whose American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan clarify the U.S. Democratic-socialist belief that government should run the whole show -- not just in the U.S., but everywhere the U.S. has influence (yes, the Biden administration's government-on-top ideology sounds not unlike what China's Xi Jinping is preaching to the world, but that convergence is another subject). </p><p>   Late last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen got the Group of 20 nations to agree in principle to establish a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%. The stated goal of this global tax (and surely there are more taxes to come) is to guarantee financial flows into the G-20's increasingly expensive national welfare systems. We know from experience that what will never arrive is \"equity,\" which somehow is always just over the horizon. </p><p>   No more prominent spokesperson for equity exists than Vice President Kamala Harris. When Mr. Biden asked her to do something about the migrants arriving at the southern border from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, she defaulted to invoking \"root causes.\" </p><p>   To address root-cause equity issues in the Northern Triangle countries, the Biden administration has proposed sending them $4 billion. It might work -- if the money were dropped from helicopters. No one better understands the failure of government-to-government income transfers than the migrants wading across the Rio Grande River. That's why they're at the border. </p><p>   They are coming here not only because Mr. Biden invited them but because the still-intact free-market U.S. economy produces the private-sector jobs that the nominally equity-based policies of their home countries never will. </p><p>   To her credit, Ms. Harris has encouraged U.S. companies such as Microsoft, Chobani and Mastercard to invest in the region. How refreshing it would be if the vice president now used her prominence to keep the focus on similar private efforts such as the HUGE Business Council, which wants to create manufacturing supply chains between Central America and the U.S., as described recently in these pages by my colleague Mary Anastasia O'Grady. </p><p>   The current run of news stories about rich countries \"monopolizing\" the Covid vaccines and exacerbating national-wealth disparities is in large part about the nations of sub-Saharan Africa. </p><p>   Without question, the better-off have a moral obligation to help struggling nations during a global pandemic. But if, as charged, there is no \"plan\" to globalize vaccine distribution, that is because First World governments have revealed themselves during the crisis to be increasingly incompetent at planning anything. </p><p>   Since World War II, much of sub-Saharan Africa and the ever-developing world have been wards of the IMF and World Bank, with marginal gains in material growth. By comparison, Taiwan and South Korea hard-wired themselves to free-market policies, developed a thriving middle class and will survive the pandemic intact. </p><p>   It's an ironic reversal of our politics that Republicans today are running mostly on the culture war, while Democrats press economics in the equity war. Narrative matters, making it possible that if Republicans don't join this battle, the Biden, Harris, Sanders and Pelosi equity warriors will win, with one certain result: more inequity everywhere. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Write henninger@wsj.com. </p><p></p>",
