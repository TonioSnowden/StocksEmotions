  "title": "Stocks Waver as Year Nears End; S&P 500 closed at records 70 times this year, more than a quarter of all trading days",
  "text": "<p>Money managers described Friday's trading activity as light, and chalked up the marginal selling to last-minute tax moves and year-end portfolio positioning by fund managers. \"Today is more about April than it is about Dec. 31,\" said Jason Thornburg, chief executive of Thornburg Investment Management, which manages nearly $50 billion in assets.</p><p>The relatively calm trading Friday juxtaposes a busy year in markets in which individual investors piled into meme stocks and the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and low interest rates motivated investments in equities. These factors helped lead the S&amp;P 500 to close at a record 70 times this year, more than a quarter of all trading days, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>That activity helped push the S&amp;P 500 up 27% in 2021, on pace for its biggest annual gain since 2019.</p><p>Much of the broader market rally was also driven by a small group of massive stocks, such as Apple, Tesla and Microsoft. Microsoft and Tesla shares have each risen more than 50% this year, while Apple has gained more than 30%.</p><p>\"This is really the year of the economic recovery,\" said Sean Markowicz, an investment strategist at Schroders. \"In 2022, I see growth cooling as the massive policy stimulus in response to the pandemic fades.\"</p><p>Investors are watching a number of risks heading into 2022 that could derail the market's rally. Cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 are surging, causing some businesses to curtail services and hours as workers call in sick. U.S. inflation reached a nearly four-decade high last month, raising questions about how many price increases Americans can absorb and if that will affect corporate earnings. The Federal Reserve has also set the stage for a series of interest-rate increases beginning next spring.</p><p>On Friday, stocks across the communication services sector slipped nearly half a percentage point. Facebook parent company Meta Platforms fell nearly 1%, while Google's Alphabet and Netflix notched minor losses.</p><p>Some meme stocks were also in the red. Shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings fell 1.3% Friday after rising more than tenfold this year. GameStop, up more than 700%, declined 0.3%.</p><p>Meanwhile, shares of vaccine makers climbed higher. Pfizer added nearly 2% in the wake of the the U.K.'s drug regulator authorizing its Covid-19 oral antiviral pill, as well as signs that public health officials in the U.S. may approve booster shots against the virus for 12- to 15-year olds as early as next week. Moderna also rose, gaining 2.3%.</p><p>Shares of Ford Motor also topped the S&amp;P 500, adding nearly 2%. The car maker's stock, which has been a favorite among retail investors all year, soared nearly 140% this year, on track for its biggest annual gain since 2009.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note held steady at 1.514%. The yield rose 0.601 percentage point this year as of Thursday, the largest one-year yield gain since 2013, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Investors have sold out of government bonds, pushing up yields, because holding bonds that yield less than inflation means locking in a loss. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged almost 0.2% lower, with markets closed in Germany, Spain and Italy. The broad-market index has risen more than 20% this year.</p><p>Shares of Hunter Douglas, a Dutch window blinds and coverings maker, surged 70% in Amsterdam trading after private equity firm 3G Capital agreed to buy a majority stake in the company.</p><p>The fast-spreading Omicron variant is clouding the outlook for oil markets after a rapid recovery in demand pushed prices to their highest levels in years. Brent crude futures, the benchmark in global oil markets, declined 0.5% Friday to $79.11 a barrel.</p><p>Shares of Chinese internet and technology companies jumped in Hong Kong on the last day of the year, following a surge in their corresponding American depositary receipts overnight. The Hang Seng Tech Index, which tracks the 30 largest technology companies listed in the city, rose 3.6% on Friday in a holiday-shortened trading session. The broader Hang Seng Index gained 1.2%.</p><p>China's Shanghai Composite added 0.6% Friday. Markets in South Korea and Japan were closed for a holiday.</p><p>Stocks Waver as Year Nears End</p>",
