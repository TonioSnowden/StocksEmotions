  "title": "Monday's Markets:  Stocks  Recover  As Fears  Abate on  Omicron  ----  By Caitlin Ostroff and Frances Yoon",
  "text": "<p>   Stocks and oil prices bounced back from Friday's selloff, with investors betting the Omicron Covid-19 variant will cause less damage to the global economic recovery than initially feared. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 jumped 60.65 points, or 1.3%, to 4655.27, recouping some of its losses after the index suffered its worst one-day percentage decline in nine months. Friday's selloff came after South Africa identified a fast-spreading strain of the coronavirus, which the World Health Organization named Omicron, and countries around the world responded with new travel restrictions. </p><p>   The Nasdaq Composite advanced 291.18 points, or 1.9%, to 15782.83, boosted by investor appetite for technology stocks. </p><p>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 236.60, or 0.7%, to 35135.94. </p><p>   Brent crude futures, the benchmark in global oil markets, rose 1% to settle at $73.44 a barrel. They tumbled more than 10% Friday, in their largest one-day percentage decline since April 2020. </p><p>   \"Friday was a panic selloff,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. \"Traders have had time to sit back and breathe a bit,\" she added, noting that trading volumes were lower over the Thanksgiving weekend, likely exacerbating declines. </p><p>   Investors are awaiting more clarity on the transmissibility and severity of the Omicron variant and data on how well it can be contained by existing vaccines. Renewed travel bans and coronavirus restrictions could threaten the global recovery. In some of the tougher moves so far, Israel has banned foreigners from entry and Japan has said it would close its borders to foreign visitors until more information about the variant is available. </p><p>   President Biden said Monday that Omicron was \"not a cause for panic.\" The administration is working with drug companies to develop contingency plans for vaccines or boosters in case they are needed, he said. </p><p>   \"There's less likelihood we see sustained downside from something like a variant because our ability to adapt to it is higher than it was,\" said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. \"The ability to tailor vaccines makes a huge difference.\" </p><p>    Moderna shares shot up $38.88, or 12%, to $368.51, adding to their gains after the stock surged more than 20% on Friday. The biotech company has said it is working to rapidly advance an Omicron-specific booster candidate. U.S.-listed shares of BioNTech, which produces a Covid-19 vaccine with Pfizer, added $14.52, or 4.2%, to $362.52. </p><p>   Some travel and leisure stocks rebounded after steep losses on Friday. Royal Caribbean Group shares added $1.91, or 2.8%, to $69.89, while shares of Carnival Cruise rose 21 cents, or 1.2%, to $18.16. </p><p>   Delta Air Lines and American Airlines Group closed slightly lower after swinging between gains and losses. </p><p>   Technology was the best-performing sector of the S&amp;P 500. Apple and Microsoft rose more than 2%. </p><p>    Twitter fell $1.29, or 2.7%, to $45.78 after the social-media company said Jack Dorsey was stepping down as chief executive, effective immediately, and being succeeded by Parag Agrawal, who was previously Twitter's chief technology officer. </p><p>   Bitcoin rebounded after the largest cryptocurrency was pummeled by Friday's selloff. The dollar value of bitcoin rose 3.5% from its 5 p.m. ET level Sunday to $58,266.08. Its gains boosted cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global, whose shares rose $16.20, or 5.3%, to $319.39. </p><p>   Investors sold U.S. government bonds, which are viewed as safe assets to hold, pushing up yields. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 1.529% from 1.484% Friday. </p><p>   Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7%.  Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average was up 0.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 1.2% and the Shanghai Composite was  up 0.1%. U.S. stock futures were up 0.2%. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Frances Yoon and Rebecca Feng contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
