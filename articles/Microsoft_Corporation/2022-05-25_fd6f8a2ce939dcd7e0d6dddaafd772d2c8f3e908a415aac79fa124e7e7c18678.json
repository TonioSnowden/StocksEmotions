Earlier Tuesday, the police department released Mr. Abdullah's name and photo, saying that he was wanted in the shooting. </p><p>\n  The shooting occurred Sunday just before noon on a Q train as it crossed the Manhattan Bridge on its way to the Canal Street station in Manhattan, police said. The victim was 48-year-old Daniel Enriquez of Brooklyn, who died at a hospital Sunday. </p><p>\n  Police said Mr. Enriquez was in the last car of the train when a man who had been pacing back and forth pulled out a gun and shot him at close range. The two men had no interaction before the shooting, witnesses told police. None of the other riders in the car were wounded. </p><p>\n  -- Joseph Pisani </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  NEW YORK STATE </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Adult Abuse Victims </p><p>\n  Get Window to Sue </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  New York will temporarily suspend its civil statute of limitations for adult sexual abuse starting in November under a law signed Tuesday by Gov. Kathy Hochul. </p><p>\n  The Adult Survivors Act will open a one-year window during which people who say they were sexually abused as adults can file claims against their alleged attackers -- regardless of when they were abused. </p><p>\n  Advocates for the new law said it is necessary because survivors of sexual abuse often require years to process their experiences and are then barred from bringing claims. </p><p>\n  -- Jimmy Vielkind </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  PHILANTHROPY </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Big Brothers Gets </p><p>\n  Large Donation </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott gave $122.6 million to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, the organization said Tuesday, the largest donation from one person in its history. </p><p>\n  Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, a mentoring organization with chapters across the nation, said it would use the money to bolster mentoring programs, pair more children with mentors, increase staff and training resources, and create and improve relationships with other groups. The unsolicited gift benefits the national organization and 38 local chapters, the group said in a statement. </p><p>\n  Ms. Scott is one of the richest women in the world, with a net worth of $31.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. She was formerly married to Amazon Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, with whom she played an instrumental role in creating the retail giant. </p><p>\n  Ms. Scott vowed to give away the majority of her wealth in 2019, signing the Giving Pledge created by Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates and Warren Buffet </p><p>\n  -- Jennifer Calfas </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  FEDERAL RESERVE </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Report Warns About </p><p>\n  Possible Paper Losses </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The Federal Reserve could reach a point where it no longer has profits to hand over to the Treasury if the central bank raises interest rates beyond recent market expectations, the New York Fed said in a report. </p><p>\n  The Fed could see paper losses on its bond holdings -- and likely did at the start of this year, the report said. The findings came in a report detailing activities around the Fed's balance sheet in 2021. The Fed's holdings of cash and bonds total $9 trillion but are set to start shrinking in June. </p><p>\n  -- Michael S.

It will rely on discussion with people inside and outside the Border Patrol, data analysis and a review of practices at other law-enforcement agencies. There have been 75 people killed in Border Patrol pursuits since January 2010, according to the ACLU. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p></p>",
