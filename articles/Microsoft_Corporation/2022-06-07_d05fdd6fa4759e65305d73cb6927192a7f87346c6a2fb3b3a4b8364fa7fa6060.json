  "text": "<p>Meta has also fallen from the top five companies in this year's rebalancing, according to FTSE Russell's June 3 statement. \"For the first time since 2019, the five largest companies in the Russell U.S. Indexes shifted,\" with Tesla Inc. TSLA replacing Meta as the fifth-largest company based on market value on so-called rank day, which was May 6, the index provider said.</p><p>Rank day is when FTSE Russell kicked off its annual rebalancing process for its Russell U.S. indexes.</p><p>Under the reshuffling, Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG overtook Amazon.com Inc. AMZN to become the third-largest company, pushing Amazon to fourth in terms of market capitalization in the Russell 3000 and Russell 1000 indexes. Apple Inc. AAPL retained its position as the biggest company while Microsoft Corp. MSFT remained the second-largest, each with a market value surpassing $2 trillion, according to the FTSE Russell statement.</p><p>While that marked the first time the rebalancing showed multiple companies exceeding a $2 trillion market cap, the U.S. equity market broadly decreased in size, according to the statement. The market cap of the broad Russell 3000 Index fell 5.9% to $44.9 trillion on rank day, from $47.7 trillion as of last year's rebalance.</p><p>Shares of Meta FB have slumped about 42% this year through Monday, and are down around 41% in the past 12 months, according to FactSet data. The company, which is part of the communication-services sector, had a market value of around $516 billion on June 3, FactSet data shows.</p><p>Read: Sheryl Sandberg leaving Facebook after 14 years</p><p>Also see: Facebook parent company Meta Platforms to change ticker symbol to META on June 9</p><p>As part of this year's Russell rebalancing, \"style factors were determined\" based on data from May 31, which will broadly impact the trading of \"value\" versus \"growth\" stocks, said Steven DeSanctis, an equity strategist at Jefferies, in a phone interview Monday. \"What ends up performing well tends to move to growth; what tends to lag moves to value,\" he said of the annual rebalancing process.</p><p>Many \"long-only\" managers are benchmarked to indexes, so they pay attention to changes in their sector weights, said DeSanctis, who led the Jefferies report.</p><p>For example, Jefferies pointed to \"big sector shifts\" in the Russell 2000 Value Index XX:RUJ, where energy is expected to see its weighting drop 5.8 percentage points to 6%. By contrast, energy is set to become a bigger part of the new Russell 2000 Growth Index XX:RUO, with its weight jumping 3.1 percentage points to 7.5%, the Jefferies report shows.</p><p>Growth managers will have to pay attention to energy, after not having to worry about that sector for the past couple of years, DeSanctis said.</p><p>Meanwhile, six of the 21 companies slated to move up under the rebalancing process to the large-cap-focused Russell 1000 Index from the small-cap-focused Russell 2000 Index are in energy. They include Antero Resources Corp. AR, Chesapeake Energy Corp. CHK, Ovintiv Inc. OVV, PDC Energy Inc. PDCE, Range Resources Corp. RRC and Southwestern Energy Co. SWN, according to the FTSE Russell statement.</p><p>\"Energy is this year's standout industry, leading the other industries in terms of index performance and the number of companies graduating from the Russell 2000 Index to the Russell 1000 Index,\" said Catherine Yoshimoto, FTSE Russell's director of product management for the Russell U.S. indexes, in the statement.</p><p>In another change among large-cap stocks, the health-care sector is expected to have a larger weight in the Russell 1000 Growth index, as UnitedHealth Group UNH is set to become 2.2% of the rebalanced index, according to the Jefferies report.</p><p>The annual rebalancing process redefines \"breakpoints\" between large, mid-sized, small and micro-cap stocks on rank day \"to ensure market changes over the last year are captured,\" FTSE Russell said.</p><p>For example, companies' market values in the small-cap-focused Russell 2000 index ranged from $234 million to $6.4 billion based on May 6 stock prices, the Jefferies report shows. Market caps for companies in the Russell 1000, which consists of large-cap stocks, ranged from $2.9 billion to $2.58 trillion at the May 6 cutoff date.</p><p>\"Each June, the Russell U.S. index family is recalibrated to accurately reflect the current state of the U.S. equity market,\" FTSE Russell said. Ahead of the June 24 rebalancing, the index provider said that updates to its preliminary lists will be posted on its website at the market's close on June 10 and 17.</p><p>Meta Platforms poised to become 'value' stock in Russell reshuffling this month, says Jefferies</p>",
