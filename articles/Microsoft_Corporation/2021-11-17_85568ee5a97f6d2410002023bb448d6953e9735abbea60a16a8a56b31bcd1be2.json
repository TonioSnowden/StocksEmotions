  "title": "Staples Center in L.A. to Be Renamed Crypto.com Arena; The deal to rename the home of the Lakers and LeBron James is the latest attempt by the upstart cryptocurrency industry to gain mainstream recognition",
  "text": "<p>In addition to the Lakers, the Staples Center is home to the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings. The 20,000-seat venue is a hub for major concerts and in entertainment-obsessed Southern California is a place to be seen by Hollywood stars both as performers and courtside spectators.</p><p>Crypto.com was founded in 2016 and has over 2,600 employees, according to its website. It offers cryptocurrency trading including letting users borrow up to 10 times their capital to invest in digital currencies. It also provides cryptocurrency-based credit cards and other digital assets such as nonfungible tokens.</p><p>The deal is the latest attempt by the upstart cryptocurrency industry to gain mainstream recognition. Digital currencies and tokens are held by a rising number of institutional investors and retail traders. The U.S. financial regulator approved the launch of the first exchange-traded fund that holds bitcoin futures contracts last month.</p><p>Other cryptocurrency companies have also targeted sports as a place to introduce themselves to the wider public. The U.S. affiliate of crypto exchange FTX forged a naming rights deal worth $135 million for the arena where the NBA's Miami Heat play. It also backed a $20 million ad campaign featuring football star Tom Brady and his wife, model and businesswoman Gisele BÃ¼ndchen.</p><p>Crypto.com allows its users to trade popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether as well as lesser-known ones. It is run by Chief Executive Kris Marszalek, a Polish-born and Hong Kong-based entrepreneur. He founded two e-commerce companies, a mobile app and a consumer electronics business before stepping into the cryptocurrency industry, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p><p>The company has been on a public relations push of late. It hired actor Matt Damon to appear in a commercial in October, joining the growing list of celebrities who have endorsed digital assets, including Kim Kardashian, Snoop Dogg and Paris Hilton. The ad's tagline was the Latin proverb, \"fortune favors the brave.\"</p><p>In 2020, Crypto.com had to halt its credit-card programs in the U.K. and Europe and reimburse users when German payments company Wirecard plunged into bankruptcy because of an accounting scandal. Crypto.com had relied on Wirecard to issue the cards.</p><p>Companies have long used stadium and arena branding deals to raise their profile. These long-term deals provide lucrative long-term income to the stadium owners and teams and expose the companies' brands over television broadcasts and through the media.</p><p>Occasionally, stadium branding deals turn sour. In 2002, Enron Corp. gave back naming rights to the Houston Astros stadium after the company filed for bankruptcy. The team covered up the company's crooked \"E\" logo emblazoned through the ballpark.</p><p>There was also a string of companies in the dot-com boom of the late 1990s that spent millions to establish their brands on stadiums, only to suffer in the years that followed. In 2000, internet provider CMGI Inc., paid for the rights to the New England Patriots' stadium for 15 years. Gillette took over the name two years later.</p><p>A risk with the cryptocurrency industry is that its underlying markets are some of the most volatile around. Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies surged earlier this month, that sent bitcoin to a high of $68,525.84 last week. It has since declined more than 10%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Staples Center in L.A. to Be Renamed Crypto.com Arena</p>",
