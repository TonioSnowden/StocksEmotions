  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>You know the drill. The last week before August means the last chance to send out quarterly earnings before the summer holiday. Companies don't seem to care that results will be lost in the mix. Some may even prefer it that way. Luckily, Lex is here to help pick apart the numbers.</p> <p>First up: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e324c41-1c7c-4e96-86d2-c8a7f2db8b58\">tech</a>. Even the sunniest forecast failed to predict quite how good this year would be for the US industry. In a single quarter, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet reported close to $200bn in revenues. All are squirrelling away wads of cash, ready for the next round of attacks from global regulators. Of the three, only Apple's shares fell in after-hours trading. True, the dip follows a rally that has pushed Apple shares up more than a tenth this year. Still, Lex sees no reason for it to end. Apple's model of selling pricey hardware that fits its luxury brand while offering users more services is working.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the sector, Microsoft and Facebook used their earnings as an excuse to talk about the mysterious concept of the metaverse. In theory, this is the space where the real world and the virtual world collide. In reality, it is a way to talk about products. Facebook wants us all to strap on Oculus virtual reality headsets. Microsoft's chief executive Satya Nadella talks of opportunities in cloud computing services as part of an “enterprise metaverse”.</p> <p>Guess who else likes talking about the metaverse? SoftBank's Masayoshi Son. Lex notes that the Japanese investor's unflagging enthusiasm for a wide range of global tech companies is proving <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00057878-394a-4146-bebd-d430b90b0b2f\">an effective hedge</a> against action taken by the Chinese government. Its investment in Chinese ride-hailing app Didi has been hammered but Son has grown more cautious in recent years. Instead of pouring in more money, SoftBank is smoothing out its losses by selling a chunk of its stake in US ride-hailing app Uber.</p> <p>Here in the real world, California is bracing itself for fire season. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bda3cad8-5064-4ab6-af3f-289bf1a1702c\">utility PG&amp;E</a> entered bankruptcy as a result of liabilities relating to wildfires. Its restructuring preserved equity, prioritising the hedge funds that hold it. Victims received a settlement partly in the form of PG&amp;E shares. Now that the stock is falling, this agreement looks unfair. Particularly if money spent on safety features does not prove sufficient.</p> <p>Setting money aside for future problems is something banks have been contending with ever since the financial crisis. This week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02851047-ce83-4e6c-aa29-25b1a59c57bd\">Deutsche Bank</a> announced a small extra loan loss provision of €141m. Europe's banking sector has been hit hard but Deutsche can at least take heart that Credit Suisse now carries the torch as the European bank with the worst reputation.</p> <p>This week, a report into the Archegos implosion was presented alongside Credit Suisse results. The conclusion was an unflattering portrait of greed and FOMO. Management deserves credit for the disclosure, says Lex. But the share price trades a fifth lower since the start of the year amid a rising sector. There is no hope of a reversal any time soon.</p> <p>At the government level, preparing for crisis means stocking up on more Covid-19 vaccines. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c88e4d8-328d-42d6-a04c-e48aa464fe48\">Follow-up jabs</a> offer pharma companies a sustainable profits boost. Booster shots every two years would take the global Covid vaccine spend to $157bn by 2025. But not everyone thinks booster jabs are necessary. Demand, not supply, will pose the real obstacle, says Lex.</p> <p>On a more personal level, thinking ahead could inspire the revival of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df283b32-56e1-442a-82e1-afea6d5f5cbf\">tontines</a>. Once used to fund wars, these involve members pooling money and then receiving an annual payment until they die — a sort of peer-to-peer annuity. Unfortunately, issuers in the past liked to include unfair clauses, including expulsion of members who paid late. If the terms were fair, Lex can see the merit in a reboot.</p> <p>Finally, the ultimate finality. Lex ended its four-month run of notes comparing the carbon footprints of various lifestyle choices with a comparison of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d5ac043-ea02-46d5-a518-098412acb48e\">burial and cremation</a>. The topic may be uncomfortable for some but the results are stark. Burial, without bells and whistles, is by far the greenest way to go.</p> <p>We hope that you have enjoyed the carbon counter series. It is a topic we expect to return to in future. If you have any suggestions of emissions calculations you're interested in, please drop us an email at <a href=\"mailto:lexfeedback@ft.com\">lexfeedback@ft.com</a>.</p> <p>Enjoy your weekend.</p> <p><strong>Elaine Moore<br></strong><em>Deputy Head of Lex</em></p><p>Source: Elaine Moore 2021 'Best of Lex: inside the metaverse' FT.com 30 July.
