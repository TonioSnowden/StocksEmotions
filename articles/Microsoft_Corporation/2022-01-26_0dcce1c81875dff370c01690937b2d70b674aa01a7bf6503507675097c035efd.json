Startups have flexibility and an ability to execute that larger companies don't have.”</p><p>The New York-based company officially launched on Tuesday with 43 employees, many of whom worked with Adam Dell when he was head of product at Marcus from 2018 to 2021. Domain Money plans to hire up to 30 more people this year.</p><p>“Thematically, we are interested in blockchain technologies that serve a core banking function, such as DeFi money markets,” Dell said.&#xa0;&#xa0;“We believe there's a class of investors who are familiar with and comfortable with Fidelity, Schwab and ETrade who don't feel like those platforms are giving them robust access to the crypto asset class. We're trying to serve that customer.”</p><p>Domain Money offers actively managed stock and crypto investment strategies managed by an expert investment team from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley MS and Bridgewater Associates.</p><p>The unique features of Domain Money include its Signal product, which monitors social media outlets and assigns a social sentiment score to each type of asset.

V handled about $10 trillion in transaction volume in 2021, while ethereum, the popular blockchain-backed cryptocurrency, accounted for about $11 trillion in volume.</p><p>The market for decentralized finance platform — or DeFi transactions, where consumers and institutions can borrow and lend money — totals roughly $200 billion in 2022, up from $1 billion in 2018.
