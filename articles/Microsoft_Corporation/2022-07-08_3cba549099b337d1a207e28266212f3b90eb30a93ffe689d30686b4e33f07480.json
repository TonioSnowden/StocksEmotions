  "text": "<p>In a video released with her new role, Ms. Morgan said she wants to get to a point where there aren't any more firsts. \"If I could be an inspiration or help or open doors for any other woman and girl out there, then that is an incredible accomplishment for me,\" she said.</p><p>She added that sports, like the gambling industry, is male-dominated. \"We need to continue to break down these barriers,\" she said.</p><p>Ms. Morgan will be tasked with steadying an NFL team that has been rocked by instability.</p><p>The team hired her to lead the franchise less than a year after former Raiders coach Jon Gruden resigned. In connection to an NFL investigation into the team now called the Washington Commanders, years-old emails Gruden had sent using a racial trope and antigay language surfaced. Mr. Gruden, who had been one of the NFL's most prominent coaches, apologized. \"I'm sorry, I never meant to hurt anyone,\" he said in a statement when he resigned.</p><p>The team has seen more turnover since, including former Raiders president Dan Ventrelle who left the team in May. Before Mr. Ventrelle split with the club, the Raiders had parted ways with president Marc Badain a year ago.</p><p>Ms. Morgan is a board member for Caesars Entertainment Inc., Allegiant Travel Co. and Fidelity National Financial. She chaired the Nevada Gaming Control Board from early 2019 through most of 2020. Before that, she was a commissioner on the Nevada Gaming Commission for less than a year, according to her LinkedIn page.</p><p>Write to Allison Prang at allison.prang@wsj.com and Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com</p><p>Las Vegas Raiders Name Sandra Douglass Morgan New President</p>",
