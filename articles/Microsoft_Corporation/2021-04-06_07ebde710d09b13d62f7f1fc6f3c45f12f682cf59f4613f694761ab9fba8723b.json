  "title": "Boss Talk:  Indeed Chief Navigates a Changed Market for Hiring  ----  By Kathryn Dill",
  "text": "<p>\n  Some five million jobs are posted on internet job-search platform Indeed Inc. right now. Its leader, Chris Hyams, says he wants to make it simpler to get one. </p><p>\n  Indeed's chief executive, a 53-year-old technology-industry veteran, witnessed up-close the job market's massive shake-up over the past year: Millions of people were laid off or furloughed, companies providing digital and essential services went on hiring sprees, and job interviews went virtual. </p><p>\n  On Indeed's job site -- the world's largest -- postings plunged nearly 40% last spring. They have been rebounding ever since. The Labor Department said Friday that U.S. employers added a seasonally adjusted 916,000 jobs in March, the best gain since August. </p><p>\n  Under Mr. Hyams, Indeed raced to adjust to the new jobs landscape. The company recently introduced a virtual platform that manages the nuts and bolts of hiring for employers -- from posting an opening to setting up video interviews. Mr. Hyams says the aim is to shorten the time it takes to fill a job. </p><p>\n  That timing will be especially important as Covid-19-ravaged industries restart hiring and need qualified people fast, he says. </p><p>\n  \"We're obviously always happy to see when people are getting jobs,\" said Mr. Hyams, who spoke with The Wall Street Journal recently from his Austin, Texas, home. \"But we're still a long way from where we want to get to\" in terms of full employment. </p><p>\n  Edited excerpts of that conversation: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Vaccines, economic forecasts -- there seem to be more reasons for job seekers to feel optimistic right now. How does that look on Indeed's platform? </p><p>\n  Mr. Hyams: There are actually more new jobs posted on Indeed right now than there were right before the pandemic. The big challenge is that it's tough to find them. </p><p>\n  And for so many people, there are entire sectors that are shut down, so people are having to turn to new opportunities. That's really where our focus has been. How can we make that simpler and faster for people to get a job? </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: How has the job-search process changed in the pandemic? </p><p>\n  Mr. Hyams: Last March and April, we saw an increase of more than 1,000%in the share of employer requests for interviews over video. We launched our own video interview feature, and we've just seen that grow over time. This is a change we think is going to be really significant. Finding time to sneak out to interview for a job is always a huge barrier that can be almost entirely eliminated with a video interview. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Are you seeing an increase in employers posting remote jobs? </p><p>\n  Mr. Hyams: Fewer than half of workers in the U.S. work in a field where remote work is an option. But for the ones where it is an option, a very large number of employers have taken jobs that were not fully remote before and made them that way. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: And at Indeed? </p><p>\n  Mr. Hyams: Indeed is one of them. We didn't have a remote workforce before. For the last year, we've had 10,000 people working from home and as we move forward, about 70% of our roles will be available as fully remote. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What do you look for when you hire at Indeed? </p><p>\n  Mr. Hyams: The DNA of the business is this mission, that we help people get jobs. When I'm hiring, the passion around that mission is a really important piece. You have a whole lot less of the \"That's not my job\" or \"That's not my problem.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Do you have a favorite interview question? </p><p>\n  Mr. Hyams: I do. But if I told you, it would be ruined. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: How should last year's graduates and the Class of 2021 be approaching the job search? </p><p>\n  Mr. Hyams: That's close to home. My eldest daughter is 25, my youngest daughter graduated in December of 2019. </p><p>\n  There is clearly no one answer. I ended up in a field completely different from where I thought I was going to be, and trying new things helped to open my eyes to a lot of different opportunities. This has happened in every generation. Obviously nothing like Covid, but big recessions always cause people to be more open-minded and look at whatever you're doing is an opportunity to develop new skills. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Your LinkedIn profile has an amazing entry: \"Musician 1991 - 1993. Tried to become a rock star. Failed. Would do it all over again.\" </p><p>\n  Mr. Hyams: Let me first just be very clear, my LinkedIn profile is not there to help attract employers! I'm not looking for a job. </p><p>\n  When I graduated college in 1989, I taught public high school special education, and I played music. Then in 1993, right before the World Wide Web happened, I ended up studying computer science and just fell in love with it. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Sounds like a career lesson in there somewhere, no? </p><p>\n  Mr. Hyams: It would be irresponsible for me to tell people, \"Quit your job and try to become a rock star.\" But I think it's really important for employers not to get stuck in this belief that someone who has a career path that has gone in different directions is someone who is unreliable or not committed. I'm always drawn to people who have funny things on their resume, because that's my experience. I'm sitting in my office, my drum set is right next to me. I still get to play. </p><p></p>",
