  "title": "U.K. Flexes New Muscle in Antitrust Probes Over Microsoft and Amazon; Britain's anticompetition watchdog has increased its scrutiny of Silicon Valley",
  "text": "<p>In a statement, Microsoft vice president and general counsel Lisa Tanzi said the company would cooperate with the investigation and that the merger would benefit both videogame players and the wider industry.</p><p>The investigations are the latest in a string of probes that has burnished the U.K.'s position as a global regulator of technology, alongside bodies representing much bigger populations such as the U.S. FTC and the European Commission. The CMA has taken a more active and expansive role in initiating probes of big tech companies since the U.K. left the European Union.</p><p>In particular, the break has empowered the CMA to play a bigger role in scrutinizing deals. As part of the EU, the U.K. would typically have deferred to the EU over reviewing large deals like the Microsoft-Activision transaction.</p><p>\"One effect of Brexit that people didn't talk about was that it was putting the U.K. back on the landscape as a regulatory gatekeeper,\" said Nicolas Petit, a competition-law professor at Italy's European University Institute.</p><p>Mr. Petit said it would be possible for Microsoft and Activision to complete the deal in the rest of the world if the U.K. blocked it, but he wasn't sure whether doing so would be economically feasible for the companies. \"The U.K. isn't just a country,\" he said. \"It's a big country, big economy, big market.\"</p><p>A spokeswoman for the CMA had no immediate comment. The regulator said it expected to release a preliminary decision on the proposed Microsoft-Activision deal by Sept. 1.</p><p>The CMA had already upended the plans of another American tech giant. Last year, it directed Meta Platforms Inc., formerly Facebook, to sell animated-images company Giphy, saying its acquisition could limit competition among platforms and British advertisers. Meta, which had acquired the company for $315 million in 2020, is appealing the decision.</p><p>The CMA also said Wednesday that it was investigating whether Amazon unfairly uses its size and data-collection practices to boost its business at the expense of independent merchants that sell on its marketplace. It said its investigation follows a current EU probe over similar issues, which doesn't cover concerns in the U.K. now that it has left the bloc.</p><p>One focus of the probe is how Amazon collects and uses nonpublic data from independent sellers on its platform. Former Amazon employees said that the company used such data to develop competing products for its private-label arm, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. In response to that story, Amazon said such practices would violate its policies, and that it had launched an internal investigation.</p><p>The regulator said it would also investigate how Amazon sets criteria that determine which merchant is the default seller on its platform and what products are offered under its Prime program, which offers fast delivery.</p><p>An Amazon spokesman said it would work closely with the regulator during the investigation and that the company believes it has always worked hard to help small businesses selling on its marketplace to succeed.</p><p>Write to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com</p><p>U.K. Flexes New Muscle in Antitrust Probes Over Microsoft and Amazon</p>",
