  "title": "FirstFT: Goldman Sachs boosts pay for junior bankers",
  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs has become the last of the big US investment banks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b33f3645-ff93-4309-a575-f92641faaa43\">to raise salaries for junior staff</a> in response to complaints about burnout from new recruits caught in a dealmaking boom during the pandemic.</p> <p>The issue of burnout among younger employees became particularly sensitive at Goldman after a group of first-year staff&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d853d6b4-1546-4435-9b7e-99e3e9475d50\">spoke out</a>&#xa0;about the effects of gruelling hours on their mental health and led to a&#xa0;fierce internal debate&#xa0;about pay.&#xa0;</p> <p>Some top executives have argued that boosting junior salaries, which are fixed and cannot be easily reduced, could set a “dangerous precedent” and attract “mercenaries”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/239631a3-c42d-4ce4-9dc5-1e3cc71ca0e9\">the Financial Times reported last month</a>.</p> <p>First-year analysts will now earn a base wage of $110,000, rising to $125,000 in their second year, according to people familiar with the decision. Those at the more senior associate rank will receive a boost to $150,000. The figures do not include annual bonuses, which can be multiples of salaries in buoyant years.</p> <p>The increases mean Goldman will have one of the most generous starting pay packages in the industry, having previously paid junior bankers less than their peers, according to Wall Street Oasis, a website that tracks pay.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Tencent imposes controls to tackle gaming addiction among children</strong> The Chinese tech giant has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ee4f40b-cad8-45f7-b8dd-de25b89736d3\">introduced new controls</a> to limit the amount of time children spend playing its games after state media labelled the gaming industry “spiritual opium”. The new restrictions will initially only apply to its flagship title&#xa0;<em>Honour of Kings.</em></p> <p><strong>2. Carbon offsets going up in smoke </strong>US forests that generate the carbon offsets <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f89c759-eb9a-4dfb-b768-d4af1ec5aa23\">bought</a> by companies including BP and Microsoft are on fire as blazes rage in North America. Corporate net-zero emission pledges rely on such projects to compensate for the carbon dioxide they generate.</p> <p><strong>3. IMF warns on crypto as national currencies</strong> The multilateral lender has warned against using cryptocurrencies as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c36c45d2-1100-4756-a752-07a217b2bde0\">legal tender</a> as El Salvador prepares to become the first nation to allow bitcoin payments for everything from haircuts to taxes.</p> <p><strong>4. Amazon union vote should be rerun, says US labour board official</strong> A failed vote to unionise at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52b88adb-1e69-43cd-93ae-2cbfb83feeb8\">should be rerun</a> over concerns that the tech giant improperly influenced workers. “Amazon's behaviour throughout the election process was despicable,” said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union.</p> <p><strong>5. Belarus opposition leader urges west to toughen sanctions </strong>Western nations need <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2e169c5-d389-4e7b-bf49-3bc4e9fd0684\">to tighten sanctions on Belarus</a> to put pressure on President Alexander Lukashenko to restore democracy and end worsening repression, opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya told the Financial Times, following <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17ff6bc9-c13f-4699-ac63-5c169a3b3d7a\">the controversy</a> surrounding Belarusian athlete Krystsina Tsimanouskaya.</p> <h1>Tokyo Olympics round-up</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Simone Biles</strong> won <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/tokyo-olympics-live-updates/2021/08/03/1024122723/simone-biles-return-balance-beam-gymnastics-olympics\">a bronze medal</a> in the balance beam, a week after taking herself out of several competitions to focus on her mental health.
