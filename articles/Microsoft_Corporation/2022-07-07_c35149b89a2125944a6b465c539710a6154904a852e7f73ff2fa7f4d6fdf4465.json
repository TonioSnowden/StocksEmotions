  "text": "<p>Microsoft vice president and general counsel Lisa Tanzi said the company would cooperate with the investigation, and that the merger would benefit both videogame players and the wider industry.</p><p>The investigations are the latest in a string of probes initiated by the regulator that has burnished its position as a global regulator of technology, alongside bodies representing much bigger populations such as the U.S. FTC and the European Commission.</p><p>The CMA has taken a more active and expansive role in initiating probes of big tech companies since the U.K. left the European Union.</p><p>A CMA spokeswoman had no immediate comment.</p><p>The regulator said it expected to release a preliminary decision on the proposed Microsoft-Activision deal by Sept. 1.</p><p>The CMA also said Wednesday that it is investigating whether Amazon unfairly uses its size and data-collection practices to boost its business at the expense of independent merchants that sell on its marketplace. It said its investigation follows an EU probe involving similar issues, which doesn't cover concerns in the U.K. now that it has left the bloc.</p><p>One focus of the probe is how Amazon collects and uses nonpublic data from independent sellers on its platform. Former Amazon employees said that the company used such data to develop competing products for its private-label arm, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Amazon said such practices would violate its policies, and that it had launched a probe.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
