  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  On the Clock:  A Cup to Lord Over Colleagues  ---  The $50 Stanley Quencher bottle holds 40 ounces and has a waiting list  ----  By Callum Borchers",
  "text": "<p>   The $50 Stanley Quencher boasts a double-walled design that puts an end to melting ice and frequent refills. Its real achievement might be solving a less technical problem: how to show off in today's casual, hybrid workplace. </p><p>   Put the Jimmy Choo shoes and Armani suits back in the closet. The new on-the-job status symbol is a tumbler only slightly smaller than hockey's Stanley Cup and nearly as valuable to some. Sometimes going for two to three times its retail price on the secondary market, this desktop trophy allows its owner to flaunt a combination of trendiness, disposable income and, presumably, bladder control. </p><p>   Stanley, a century-old brand that you might associate with Grandpa's camping gear, reports the waiting list for its 40-ounce drinking vessel peaked at 150,000 customers this year after millennial women with large social-media followings helped repopularize it. Sales this year are up 275%, compared with last year, the company says, a figure that doesn't count resales on websites like Poshmark. </p><p>   Rhonda Jarrar, Google's head of talent-outreach partnerships in North America, says Instagram led her to covet a sold-out Quencher. But she couldn't bring herself to spend the $100-plus commanded by people trying to flip theirs for a profit. She waited for a restock, pounced on one at face value and now relishes the admiring banter that ensues when she takes a sip on video calls. </p><p>   Just one thing could increase her satisfaction. \"I'm fully remote, so sadly I don't get the chance to status-signal to co-workers\" in person, she says. </p><p>   The notion of a status water bottle, laughable just a few years ago, is a product of the new work order. </p><p>   Many traditional markers of style and success -- think designer handbags and Swiss watches -- are either off-camera during Zoom meetings or seem overly dressy in offices that are more laid-back than before the pandemic. </p><p>   We may be working, dressing and accessorizing differently, but we still like to preen. The Covid era helped elevate the cache of such humble items as hoodies, fanny packs and baseballcaps. Here comes a four-pound kettlebell of drinkware (I weighed mine, full, on a kitchen scale) with a fantastical logo. (It features a winged bear wearing a crown. A grizzly griffin? Grizziffin?) </p><p>   Quencher fans say they love its ability to keep drinks hot or cold and that it fits in a car cupholder, despite its mondo size, thanks to a tapered bottom. Others say it's overhyped. </p><p>   It's \"the Patagonia vest of water bottles,\" says Ali Nix, a 31-year-old marketing account director in Boston, of the popular fleece zip-ups sometimes derided as \"bro vests.\" </p><p>   Strategically positioned in your webcam frame or perched on the conference table, the Quencher is bound to draw reactions like the ones Axle Dean Looslie says he received when debuting his overgrown mug at work this month: \"'Oh, you got one? I want one!'\" </p><p>   Mr. Looslie, a 36-year-old industrial designer in Utah, says he feels like a late adopter in his state, home to a disproportionate share of digital tastemakers who promote Stanley's beverage caddy over similar options by Yeti, Owala and other rivals. He recalls his father owning a Stanley insulated bottle many years ago, in the company's signature hammertone green, and says it's quite a shift to see pastel versions catch fire among millennials and Gen Zers. </p><p>   Brittany Stenersen, 36, says she didn't expect to become part of a craze when she ordered a Quencher a couple of years ago. She just wanted the biggest cup she could find for her husband, a kidney donor who needed to drink copious amounts of water to flush his system after surgery. </p><p>   Ms. Stenersen, a hairdresser, picked up one for herself and got compliments from customers, including some who'd seen the supersize drinkware on social media and wanted their own. </p><p>   This sparked a business idea. She sells hair products at Mary Kay-style parties in her New Hampshire home and says she usually draws five or six women. She says shetripled attendance at a party this week by advertising a Quencher raffle. </p><p>   Stanley President Terence Reilly is a connoisseur of improbably cool products, having been the chief marketing officer at Crocs. He confirms that women are largely responsible for the renaissance at Stanley, a historically male-focused company. They now drive roughly half of water-bottle sales. \"What we're seeing is a return-to-office trend of matching their Quencher to their outfit,\" he says. \"Women are using this as an accessory, so they're purchasing more than one.\" </p><p>   He adds that it's taken several months for manufacturing and distribution to catch up to demand and insists that the company isn't employing a scarcity model. The company wants to be able to sell to everyone who wants to buy, especially as the holiday shopping season begins. The $50 sticker price on the newest lineup represents a 25% increase. </p><p>   Jenny Chynoweth told me she's been hoping to find a Quencher under the tree this Christmas. I wrote to the 51-year-old founder of Kohr Consulting, a Seattle recruiting business, after stumbling on a LinkedIn post from nine months ago in which she declared: \"I need one of these.\" </p><p>   When we first connected last week, she still hadn't snagged one -- even though she's done some recruiting for Stanley's parent company, HAVI. Adding to her frustration, a business associate recently flashed a Quencher on a video call. \"Of course, I was very jealous of her,\" Ms. Chynoweth said. </p><p>   Then two tumblers arrived on her doorstep. Santa hadn't come early; she'd asked Stanley for permission to speak on the record and the company sent her a pair. </p><p>   The best part? After our interview, she had another meeting scheduled with the same business associate who provoked her envy. </p><p>   \"I can't wait to talk to her today and just casually sip in front of her,\" Ms. Chynoweth said. </p><p></p>",
