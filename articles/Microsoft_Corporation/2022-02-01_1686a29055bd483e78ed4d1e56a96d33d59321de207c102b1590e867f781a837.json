  "text": "<p>Below is a list of seven semiconductor stocks the analysts, led by Mark Lipacis, believe might be best to own through this cycle.</p><p>A pattern to follow</p><p>Here are three charts to illustrate these patterns, based on price action for the iShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX, which tracks the performance of the PHLX Semiconductor Index SOX of 30 stocks.</p><p>The first chart runs from the end of 2013 through the end of 2015:</p><p>FactSetYou can see the repeat pattern of peaks, pullbacks and rebounds.</p><p>Here's the action for SOXX from the end of 2016 through the end of 2018:</p><p>FactSetOnce again, we see the pattern of “repeat peaks” for SOXX.</p><p>Now look at a one-year chart for SOXX through the close on Jan. 28:</p><p>FactSetIn a note to clients on Jan. 31, Lipacis called the current pattern, with SOXX down 19% from its intraday high at $559 on Jan. 4 through the close at $455 on Jan. 28, another “peaking process.”</p><p>His analysis of the previous two times this happened indicates that there are “multiple mini-peaks and troughs” that typically last 45 days. So we may still be at an early stage for the current mini-cycle.</p><p>Lipacis went on to write that semiconductor stocks can swing plus or minus 40% during these periods and that “the stocks that do the worst during the mini-downcycles usually do best during the mini-upcycles, which suggests owning” the following seven, “especially after recent weakness.”</p><p> Company                      Ticker  Price decline – 2022  Decline from 52-week high  Closing price – Jan. 28  52-week high  Date of 52-week high  Nvidia Corp.
