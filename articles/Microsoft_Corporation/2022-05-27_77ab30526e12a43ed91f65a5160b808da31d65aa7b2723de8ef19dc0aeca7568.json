  "text": "<p>VMware Inc.</p><p>A giant chip maker wants to become a powerhouse in the world of corporate software. Broadcom Inc. plans to buy software firm VMware for $61 billion in cash and stock, the companies said Thursday after The Wall Street Journal reported on talks earlier in the week. The pact is one of the year's biggest deals and would push Broadcom deeper into an arena occupied by International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle Corp. It would nearly triple the size of Broadcom's software division and account for nearly 49% of the company's revenue. VMware shares added 3.2% Thursday after jumping 25% Monday.</p><p>Abbott Laboratories</p><p>A major producer of baby formula apologized for the fact that baby formula is now hard to find. In a Washington Post opinion article published May 21, Abbott Chief Executive Robert Ford said, \"We're sorry to every family we've let down,\" and promised production would increase again in June. For months, supply-chain issues made baby formula harder to find, but the shortfall worsened after Abbott recalled some products and closed a Michigan plant over reports of bacterial contamination. President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act on May 18 to boost production and launched a program to bring in supplies from overseas. On Tuesday, Abbott said it would release about 300,000 cans of a specialty infant formula for children in urgent medical need. Abbott shares gained 1.6% Monday.</p><p>Zoom Video Communications Inc.</p><p>Zoom wants to make new connections. Chief Executive Eric Yuan said the company is pivoting to some products that promote hybrid-work setups as more workers split time between in-person and remote work. Companies have looked to return to physical workspaces after shifting to remote or hybrid formats for much of the pandemic, but employers face obstacles such as backlash from unions and rising Covid-19 cases that haven't been well-reflected in reported tallies. The videoconferencing company raised its profit outlook Monday while reporting its slowest growth rate on record as demand wanes and employees are called back to offices. Zoom shares rose 5.6% Tuesday.</p><p>Lyft Inc.</p><p>Lyft is putting the brakes on spending. The ride-hailing company will slow hiring, reduce some departments' budgets and grant new stock options to some employees to make up for its eroding share price, President John Zimmer said in a staff memo Tuesday. Lyft joins rival Uber Technologies Inc. in outlining cuts as investor optimism cools on tech stocks. The companies also face a yearlong driver shortage that has pushed fares to record highs. Higher prices helped boost both companies' revenue but contributed to riders taking fewer trips compared with prepandemic levels. Lyft shares lost 0.4% Wednesday.</p><p>Apple Inc.</p><p>Apple's fight to keep talent will take a larger slice of its spending. The iPhone maker is boosting pay for workers amid rising inflation, a tight labor market and unionization pushes among hourly store employees. The company told employees in an email Wednesday that the company is increasing its overall compensation budget. Starting pay for hourly workers in the U.S. will rise to at least $22 an hour, a 45% jump from 2018, and starting salaries are also expected to increase. Apple's plans follow similar moves by companies looking for ways to hang on to talent. Microsoft Corp. recently told workers it would almost double its global budget for merit-based salary raises. Apple shares added 2.3% Thursday.</p><p>Macy's Inc.</p><p>The Macy's shopper is showing some resilience. The retailer reported strong sales and raised its profit outlook, bucking the trend of lower spending in the face of inflation reported by Walmart Inc., Target Corp. and other chains. Macy's said its customers spent more on clothing for work and special occasions, and that middle- and higher-income shoppers have been less affected by inflation compared with lower-income consumers. But it is unclear how long the trend will last, as Macy's finance chief said he expects inflation to outpace wage growth and weigh on consumer health. Macy's shares surged 19% Thursday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>Snap, VMware, Macy's: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
