  "text": "<p>Having fallen for months on fears about rising interest rates and soaring inflation, stocks have shot higher in recent days as investors cheered earnings from large financial firms.</p><p>\"We are seeing better-than-feared earnings reports, and Treasury yields are pulling back—both are positives for the stock market,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Financial Inc.</p><p>Data released Tuesday morning showed home-price growth slowed sharply, sending bond yields tumbling.</p><p>The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note slid to 4.092% from 4.231% on Monday as bond prices rose, according to Tradeweb. Monday's yield was its highest closing level since 2008. The two-year yield, which is closely tied to central bank policy expectations, edged lower to 4.466% from 4.498%, retracing a larger move immediately following the housing print.</p><p>Falling long-term yields propelled segments of the stock market most sensitive to interest rates. Shares of utilities and real estate firms—that offer high dividends and sometimes compete with bond yields—gained 2.1% and 3.3% as of early Tuesday afternoon, respectively.</p><p>\"This is a pretty broad-based rally, but clearly the leadership is in rate-sensitive sectors,\" added Mr. Hogan.</p><p>Growth segments of the market also saw gains, as investors place more value on those companies' future earnings when interest rates are lower. Technology and consumer discretionary stocks rose 1.2% and 1.6%, respectively. Nearly all of the S&amp;P 500 11 sectors were in the green, save shares of energy firms.</p><p>Higher mortgage rates are crimping housing demand, denting red-hot home price inflation that has buoyed headline inflation measures. Stocks turned higher following the data release because some investors saw the drop in demand as a sign that the Fed's monetary tightening is reining in inflation.</p><p>Hopes—and bets—are building that the Federal Reserve could be approaching a point at which it feels comfortable easing the pace of its interest rate increases.</p><p>Fed officials are expected to raise interest rates by another 0.75 percentage point next week, but are also expected to debate a smaller increase toward the end of the year, offering investors hope that the worst could be behind them.</p><p>\"It would be prudent here for policy makers to step on the brake a little bit. It would be prudent to signal that they aren't going to let financial conditions get too tight,\" said Brian O'Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum International Funds.</p><p>The megacap technology firms set to report earnings could offer a barometer of the U.S. consumer. Higher interest rates that proved to be a boon for bank earnings could have the opposite effect on interest rate-sensitive tech firms.</p><p>Mike Edwards, deputy chief investment officer at Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers, said both inflation and fears of Federal Reserve tightening may have peaked in recent weeks. \"If regime change is a three-legged stool, the next component is corporate earnings.\"</p><p>Mr. Edwards said he is focused on whether revenues remain robust and how resilient margins are to cost pressures. He said he is concerned about companies' ability to forecast future performance given uncertainty around the strong dollar's impact on profits earned abroad.</p><p>\"I do think we will get some of those questions answered this week,\" he added.</p><p>Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Spotify are set to report results after markets close, setting the tone for a week of tech earnings with Apple, Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Amazon.com due to report later in the week.</p><p>Shares of General Electric slipped 1.2% as it outlined plans to cut costs. General Motors rose 3.2% after reporting earnings that were ahead of forecasts. 3M shares fell 0.4% after the sticky-note maker reported lower sales. United Parcel Service rose 3.2% after reporting earnings that beat forecasts but later lost much of those gains, rising just 0.3% on the day.</p><p>U.S. listed Chinese stocks indexes are recovering some of Monday's record losses after President Xi Jinping's political-shakeup to kick off his third term. The Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index rose 4.1% in Tuesday trading following a 14% drop on Monday.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, gained 0.6% to $91.78 a barrel.</p><p>Elsewhere, Japan's Nikkei 225 was an outperformer in Asia, rising 1%. In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.9%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Eric Wallerstein at eric.wallerstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rise Amid Earnings Stampede, Hopes for Easier Fed Policy</p>",
