  "title": "C-Suite Strategies (A Special Report): Management Top 250  ---  Companies Struggle to Stand Out in ESG Measures:  Different metrics are often rolled into one number, making it hard to differentiate  ----  By Rick Wartzman and Kelly Tang",
  "text": "<p>   Companies have a lot of good reasons to pay close attention to environmental, social and governance factors: attracting talented employees who want to work at a place that is making a positive impact on the world; responding to regulators who are demanding more ESG-related transparency; and pleasing major investors who are pushing them to be sustainable for the long haul. </p><p>   But there's at least one thing that being ESG-minded may not do: help a corporation stand out from the crowd as much as other actions might. </p><p>   That's the big takeaway from our latest analysis of the Management Top 250, an annual ranking produced in partnership between the Drucker Institute and The Wall Street Journal. It uses the central principles of Peter Drucker to assess a company's \"effectiveness,\" which the late management scholar defined as \"doing the right things well.\" The 2020 list was published in December. </p><p>   In all, we evaluated 886 large, publicly traded companies last year through the lens of 33 indicators that fall into five categories: customer satisfaction, employee engagement and development, innovation, social responsibility and financial strength. </p><p>   To form our rankings, firms are compared in each of the five areas, as well as in their overall effectiveness, through standardized scores with a typical range of 0 to 100 and a mean of 50. </p><p>   In our most recent research, we wanted to see where companies were setting themselves apart, thereby shedding light on the richest opportunities for firms to build a distinct reputation or brand identity. </p><p>   The runaway winner was innovation, where the spread between the highest-scoring company in our universe (Amazon.com Inc. at 135.9) and the lowest (Apartment Investment &amp; Management Co. at 36.5) is a whopping 99.4 points. </p><p>   In fact, because several other companies in addition to Amazon score over 100 in innovation -- literally off the charts -- this is the one category in our rankings where the 886 firms are not within the bounds of a normal distribution. You can picture this as a fat tail to the right, throwing off the shape of the bell curve. </p><p>   All of the other categories -- including social responsibility, where our ESG metrics are housed -- have normal distributions. </p><p>   Nonetheless, the configuration within social responsibility is striking. It has by far the narrowest span -- 50 points -- between the highest-scoring company (Microsoft Corp. at 78.9) and the lowest-scoring firm (Seaboard Corp. at 28.9). The differential is 67.3 points in customer satisfaction, 73.4 points in employee engagement and development and 76.3 points in financial strength. </p><p>   None of this is to play down how essential the social-responsibility category is to our model. Indeed, it has correlated more strongly with total effectiveness over the years than have any of the other four areas. </p><p>   What's more, a 50-point gap between the highest- and lowest-scoring companies in social responsibility is hardly trivial. In statistical terms, that's five standard deviations -- roughly equivalent to the difference in height between National Basketball Association center Joel Embiid, who stands 7 feet tall, and Muggsy Bogues, who, at 5-feet-3, was the shortest player in league history. </p><p>   At the same time, our findings do highlight some important nuances when it comes to the way ESG is measured. The first is that the various components and subcomponents of ESG are often rolled up into a single metric, and that tends to wash out differences among companies. </p><p>   \"You really need to dig in and look at the E separately from the S separately from the G,\" says R. Paul Herman, the chief executive of HIP Investor, which along with CSRHub, Sustainalytics and several others provides the social-responsibility data that we use in our rankings. </p><p>   Another issue is that companies are, in many cases, rewarded by ESG trackers for having a policy in place for, say, emission reduction or not using forced labor in their supply chain. Because it's easier for corporations to put something on the books than it is for them to follow through and make sure that these policies are being carried out, that also results in a clustering of ESG scores. </p><p>   \"Much of it is process-based, not performance-based,\" says Tensie Whelan, director of the Center for Sustainable Business at NYU Stern School of Business. </p><p>   There are signs that this is changing, however, as the ESG field matures. And as the metrics increasingly reflect who is actually taking care of people and the planet in ways that are meaningful, we suspect that companies will distinguish themselves all the more -- some for better and others for worse. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Wartzman is the head of the KH Moon Center for a Functioning Society, a part of the Drucker Institute, and Ms. Tang is the institute's senior director of research.
