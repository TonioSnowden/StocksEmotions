  "text": "<p>I disagree with Bill Gates that to stop buying plastic straws is not a worthwhile behavioural change for individuals seeking to support responsible consumption (“Bill Gates: My Green manifesto”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c11bb885-1274-4677-ba05-fcbac67dc808\">Life &amp; Arts</a>, FT Weekend, February 20).</p> <p>This response exemplifies an inherent bias in the ongoing global discourse that has resulted in net zero carbon emissions being equated to (or seen as a substitute for) the much wider objective of sustainable development.</p> <p>This is not to argue that net zero is not a critical goal, but its dominance of the sustainability narrative will end up doing incalculable harm to the cause of other equally important sustainability challenges facing the world. </p> <p>For instance, environmental pollution, plastic waste and water stress may be much more localised challenges and thus not able to command the same global attention as climate change. But their impacts can be equally damaging and far more immediate. </p> <p>India's top six cities had more than 120,000 deaths in 2020 attributed to elevated levels of PM2.5 pollution, the particles which are about one-thirtieth the width of a human hair and can penetrate deep into the lungs. </p> <p>More than 6bn tonnes or 80 per cent of all plastics produced in the world has been dumped into landfills or the natural environment, including oceans. </p> <p>A quarter of the world's population is already facing extreme water stress, according to World Resources Institute.</p> <p>What we need, therefore, is an “all of the above” approach to achieve the 17 targets forming part of the UN sustainable development goals framework. </p> <p>The correct response from Gates would be to wholeheartedly encourage responsible consumption, including not using or buying plastics straws. </p> <p><strong>Anshul Rai <br></strong><em>Dubai, UAE</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Plastic straws and the climate change camel' FT.com 26 February.
