  "text": "<p>Royal Dutch Shell has stepped up cash returns, raising its dividend almost 40 per cent and pledging to start a $2bn share buyback scheme to be completed by the end of this year.</p> <p>The oil major unexpectedly hiked its dividend by 24 cents a share from 17.35 cents a share from the second quarter. Chief executive Ben van Beurden had said in April the dividend would likely remain unchanged for the rest of 2021 after raising it slightly at its previous earning report.</p> <p>News of the return of cash came as Shell reported a jump in quarterly earnings after oil recovered to above $70 a barrel in the second quarter. </p> <p>In the second quarter Shell reported adjusted net profit of $5.5bn, slightly ahead of analyst expectations of $5bn and up from $3.2bn in the first quarter.&#xa0;Cash flow from operations, excluding working capital movements, hit $14.2bn in the second quarter, exceeding analyst expectations for $12.1bn.</p> <p><em>How are you coping on what is one of the busiest days of the year for corporate news? Send me an email to citybulletin@ft.com.</em></p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> upgraded its full-year targets after brighter economic forecasts allowed the UK lender to slash the size of its loan loss provisions for a second straight quarter. The UK's largest retail lender reported a pre-tax profit of £2bn for the second quarter, comfortably ahead of average analyst predictions of around £1.2bn. It lost £676m in the same quarter last year. </p> <p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> reported $1.2bn of sales from its Covid-19 vaccine in the first half of the year. The drugmaker said investment in the vaccine skimmed four cents off its earnings per share, which were $1.61 in the first half, or $2.53 on an adjusted basis. It beat expectations on sales, at $15.5bn compared to the consensus forecast of $14.8bn.</p> <p><strong>Anglo American</strong> revealed plans to return an extra $2bn to shareholders after posting $12.1bn in interim underlying ebitda, up 262 per cent year on year.</p> <p><strong>Diageo</strong> said it expected margins to improve further in the current year as sales volumes recover, albeit with near-term volatility to remain. The Smirnoff and Guinness maker reported an operating profit of £3.7bn for the 12 months ended June, up 74.6 per cent year on year, as net sales rose 8.3 per cent to £12.7bn.</p> <p><strong>BAE Systems</strong> raised full-year targets and launched a £500m share buyback programme in combination with its interim results. The defence contractor also raised its dividend by 5 per cent after posting half-year underlying earnings of £1bn, up 27 per cent year on year.</p> <p><strong>BT</strong> said it remained on track to meet expectations for the next two years after posting a pre-tax profit of £536m for the first quarter ended June, down 4 per cent year on year. The telecoms group also revealed a new strategic partnership with Microsoft to target businesses.</p> <p><strong>Schroders</strong> said total assets under management rose 6 per cent to a record high of £700.4bn in the first half as the fund manager booked £17.9bn in net new business. Its interim results delivered a 33 per cent rise in pre-tax profit £373.9m.</p> <p><strong>Rentokil Initial</strong> nudged its full-year profit target higher, as economic reopening offsets a slowdown for disinfection services. Half-year results from the pest control group showed adjusted pre-tax profit rising 60 per cent to £194m on revenue up 18.3 per cent to £1.5bn.</p> <p>US investment bank Raymond James said it had reached a deal to buy <strong>Charles Stanley</strong>, the UK stockbroker, for £278.9m. Raymond James agreed to pay 515p&#xa0;in cash, a 43.5 per cent premium to&#xa0;Charles&#xa0;Stanley's July 28 close.</p> <p>Events group <strong>Informa</strong> increased full-year revenue guidance to reflect demand for subscription-led businesses, digital diversification and a growing confidence that physical event activity was returning. For the half year Informa posted an adjusted operating profit of £69.2m from £118.6m the year before.</p> <p>Software maker <strong>Sage</strong> said in a trading update for the nine months to June that full-year recurring revenue will be slightly above its previous guidance.</p> <p>Caterer <strong>Compass</strong> said in a third-quarter trading statement that profitability was recovering towards the top end of expectations. The company said it expects trading in the current quarter to be between 80 and 85 per cent of pre-Covid levels.</p> <p><strong>Weir </strong>resumed dividends and left full-year guidance unchanged. Interim results from the engineer showed a 31 per cent improvement in pre-tax profit to £102m.</p> <p>Half-year results from <strong>Smith &amp; Nephew</strong>, the medical device maker, showed a swing into operating profit of $23m from a $5m loss the year before as elective surgeries resumed. </p> <p><strong>Johnson Matthey</strong>, the platinum-based chemicals refiner, said sales have returned to pre-pandemic levels with revenue up 63 per cent in the first quarter ended June. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>The implosion of family office Archegos Capital continued to weigh on <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>'s results as the Swiss bank reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef996142-e5dd-45ae-9008-fc4cbd8c291d\">a 78 per cent fall</a> in profits for the second quarter.</p> <p><strong>Airbus</strong> has doubled its profit forecast to €4bn for the year after delivering a stronger than expected performance in the first half, buoyed by resurgent demand for aircraft in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. </p> <p>Fuelled by coffee and supplements, <strong>Nestlé</strong> delivered its strongest growth in first half sales in more than a decade, as consumers doubled down on new buying habits acquired during the pandemic. However the world's largest food company warned that rising commodity prices will put pressure on profits in the coming months. </p> <p><strong>Samsung Electronics</strong> said it was bullish on prospects for its crucial semiconductor business in the second half of the year, but warned of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8c40cf1-0525-49b6-aa83-1165abbf75c4\">growing supply chain risks</a> due to a resurgence in Covid-19.</p> <p><strong>The Federal Reserve</strong> has&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b5992d3-967e-4a63-b159-a398654d6199\">moved one step closer</a>&#xa0;to the day when it will start slowing its massive monetary support for the US economy, following a meeting of policymakers that highlighted both the promise and the perils of the American recovery.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Mohamed El-Erian <br></strong>Governments <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9f6c876-22bb-498c-a425-78287455a3e1\">need to be more open</a> to embracing the innovations of crypto and channelling them in a better direction for finance, the economy and society at large. Absent a more co-operative approach, the west may find their future being determined by what a faster-moving China is doing and intends to do.</p> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>Asset manager Silchester's real objection to the £9.5bn take-private of Wm Morrison <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14e6eff3-f5cd-4556-8f1e-74d7b108b754\">seems to be timing</a>, given that the market thinks there are other bids to come.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Shell increases returns to shareholders as profits surge' FT.com 29 July.
