  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  Go Four It: U.K. Tries  Shorter Workweeks  ----  By Kathryn Dill",
  "text": "<p>   Thousands of workers in the U.K. are embarking on four-day workweeks this week, one of the largest tests of whether employees can accomplish just as much -- for the same pay -- in fewer hours. </p><p>   More than 3,300 workers at 70 businesses ranging from banks to fast-food restaurants to marketing agencies are participating in the six-month pilot project. The study's organizers include U.K.-based think tank Autonomy and two nonprofits focused on the four-day approach. They will work with researchers at Cambridge University, Oxford University and Boston College to explore how a shorter workweek affects company revenue and productivity, as well as employee turnover and health. </p><p>   The study is the latest effort to examine whether reducing workers' hours can improve employee well-being without sacrificing productivity, an approach that has attracted more attention in recent years, according to company executives, labor organizers, academics and some governments. The four-day workweek is one of many ways some employers say the Covid-19 era has prompted them to rethink the traditional five-day, 40-hour schedule as they look to boost employee loyalty and morale. </p><p>   \"The biggest driver of change has been the impact of the pandemic, but specifically the impact on leaders becoming interested in this idea,\" said Joe O'Connor, chief executive of 4 Day Week Global, one of the nonprofits organizing the U.K. study. </p><p>   Companies in the U.S. and Canada are participating in a smaller pilot led by the organizers of the U.K. study. Consumer-goods company Unilever recently tested the concept in its New Zealand offices and has extended the trial until the end of June. Spain's government said last year it would pay companies to test out a four-day week, and in Belgium, government leaders have proposed allowing employees to work more hours a day to forgo a fifth workday. </p><p>   Those initiatives follow an Iceland study, in which more than 2,500 employees across industries worked a shorter week between 2015 and 2019. Researchers reported the findings last year and said overall output didn't decline in most workplaces over the four years. In some cases, it improved, they said. Meanwhile, most workers maintained or improved their productivity and reported reduced stress. </p><p>   In the U.S., Brooklyn-based crowdfunding company Kickstarter began experimenting with a Monday-through-Thursday workweek in April and is participating in 4 Day Week Global's North American study. Chief Strategy Officer Jon Leland said that, so far, employee engagement has been high and productivity consistent. </p><p>   Kickstarter, which has roughly 90 employees, didn't adjust any of its business targets to accommodate the truncated hours. Instead, it is trying to eliminate or shorten unnecessary meetings, he said. Though employees are free to communicate on Fridays, which they now have off, managers aren't supposed to contact direct reports. </p><p>   \"It sounds really dramatic,\" Mr. Leland said. \"But if you talk to anybody who works at any company, they'll tell you all the ways their work is inefficient and they waste time.\" </p><p>   In May, a proposal from California Democrats to require private-sector employers with more than 500 employees to pay hourly workers overtime after logging more than 32 hours a week was shelved. It failed to advance after the California State Assembly's Labor and Employment Committee declined to set it for a policy hearing, effectively ending its chances of progressing in the current legislative session. </p><p>   Research into the impact of shortened weeks on the broader economy is mixed. Studies by university economists out of Germany and France found that fewer hours didn't increase employment. A 2013 study led by a labor economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on private companies in Belgium found that employees who worked between 25 and 35 hours a week were more productive than those who worked more or less than that. </p><p>   In 2019, Microsoft Corp. discontinued a four-day week experiment in Japan after five weeks. A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment on the outcome. </p><p>   And some employers aren't in favor of a four-day workweek. </p><p>   A recent survey of 459 companies, mostly in technology, found that 90% of firms didn't plan to adopt a four-day workweek, according to Sequoia Consulting Group, which conducted the research. </p><p></p>",
