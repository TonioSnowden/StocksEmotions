  "title": "Diller's Returns Could Beat Buffett's --- Investing record at IAC has rivaled Berkshire Hathaway's until this year's tech meltdown; his approach may pay off again",
  "text": "<p>No, not value investor Warren Buffett, who has in any case aged out of that cohort; Barry Diller has produced similarly impressive returns with a starkly different strategy -- until recently, that is.</p><p>His internet conglomerate, IAC Inc., has shed over 60% of its value this year amid the broad tech stock selloff. Its latest spinoff, video-streaming platform Vimeo, has lost 82% of its value since it began trading independently last year. And one bet that did pay off has potentially put him in peril: Mr. Diller is under investigation for potential securities fraud for options bets on Activision Blizzard in January within his personal portfolio made days before the videogame maker agreed to be acquired by Microsoft Corp.</p><p>His response to market weakness has been Buffett-esque, noting in an interview that it won't alter his playbook. But, unlike Mr. Buffett, who has famously described his favorite holding period for Berkshire Hathaway as \"forever,\" Mr. Diller employs a catch-and-release strategy at IAC: The company builds or acquires assets, revamps them and then spins them off once they reach maturity.</p><p>\"We have no competition with this business model,\" Mr. Diller says. \"Maybe because it's crazy and maybe because it's savvy.\"</p><p>Lately, it has looked a little crazy. IAC's May shareholder letter was an illustration of that energy, suggesting the reset in valuations will offer \"the most fertile ground we've seen in a while\" for new acquisitions. \"Opportunity abounds,\" IAC Chief Executive Joey Levin wrote, \"and we will always be building.\"</p><p>IAC shares have slumped 30% since then, and it isn't just guilt by tech association. The most recently reported monthly metrics show revenue for IAC's publishing business down 23% year over year, its search business down 55% and even its \"emerging\" business, which includes on-demand care site Care.com, down 2%.</p><p>Growth in what today is its largest business segment, home services, has decelerated from 27% in June to just 8% in October. Investors' focus on these monthly metrics has been so critical that the company said it would soon cease to provide them.</p><p>Mr. Levin lamented in last week's IAC shareholder letter that perceptions of Mr. Diller's holding company have swung from \"extreme confidence to extreme skepticism.\"</p><p>But, unlike so much of the internet sector this year, IAC was no tech-bubble 2.0 flash in the pan. From what it considers its inception -- when Mr. Diller took the helm in 1995 -- through 2021, IAC created nearly $90 billion for its shareholders, according to the company's calculations.</p><p>Over that period, IAC and its spinoffs returned 15% on a compounded annual basis -- more than Berkshire Hathaway or the S&amp;P 500, including dividends, according to company reports and Wall Street Journal calculations.</p><p>\"History shows spinning off companies can be beneficial. In a 22-year study beginning January 2000, special situations research boutique The Edge Consulting Group showed spinoffs as an asset class generated three to four times the S&amp;P 500's returns on average over the first 12 months, concluding \"the sum of the parts is greater than the whole.\"</p><p>IAC was a spinoff itself, incorporated in 1986 as Silver King Broadcasting Co., a subsidiary of the Home Shopping Network. Silver King, which would eventually become IAC, was spun off to Home Shopping Network shareholders in 1992 as a separately traded public company.</p><p>Since its spinoff of four companies in 2008, including Ticketmaster and Tree.com (now LendingTree), IAC and its \"SpinCos\" returned 29% on a compounded annual basis through the end of last year, according to the company, and 47% in the five years through 2021. Berkshire and the S&amp;P returned just 13% and 18.5%, respectively, on the same basis over the same five-year period.</p><p>Those returns don't lack drama. While Mr. Buffett leans heavily on tried and true household names such as Coca-Cola, Mr. Diller has made IAC a success through a history of investing in underappreciated or misunderstood assets, often at particularly confounding times.</p><p>Through its investment in Ticketmaster, IAC got into online dating platform Match.com in 1999, one year before the dot-com bust. The company took a controlling interest in online travel agent Expedia less than two months before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, which grounded the travel industry, and acquired the remainder of the company in 2003.</p><p>More recently, IAC bought caregiver site Care.com after its stock imploded in 2019 due to a number of reported tragic outcomes following a lack of background checks. And it bought a $1 billion stake in MGM Resorts International just months into the pandemic that temporarily shut casinos down.</p><p>Now IAC is trying to make money by reviving a dying print magazine business online via last year's acquisition of Meredith Corp. It also is the largest single shareholder in car sharing marketplace Turo, as ride-share stocks Uber and Lyft have lost over half their market value on average over the past year.</p><p>Additionally, IAC has recently undertaken what Mr. Levin has described as a \"difficult and expensive\" renovation project with its biggest bet, home services platform Angi.</p><p>The Angi remodel has gone so poorly that Mr. Levin took the helm of that company himself about a month ago in an effort to turn things around. IAC owns 84% of publicly traded Angi, with shares worth a little under $1 billion as of last week, according to IAC. Analysts don't expect an operating profit until 2024.</p><p>Mr. Diller isn't bothered by that, either.\"It's either going to be a huge success or an embarrassing failure,\" he said. \"I like those stakes because whenever I've confronted them in the past, at any kind of scale, it has worked out.\"</p><p>As confident as he is in his current stable of unproven investments, even Mr. Diller has his limits. In the interview, he said the metaverse is \"mostly noise\" and he described cryptocurrency as \"a huge speculation on very spindly legs.\"</p><p>Mr. Diller's general lack of interest in what many believe is tech's next frontier raises the question of whether his IAC, which has historically focused its efforts on fostering Web2, or the version of the internet we think of today, risks obsolescence.</p><p>IAC has worked over the past few decades to bring business that has long been conducted offline, online. And it is here where it is still making most of its bets.</p><p>Mr. Diller's previous success stories are giving analysts comfort. In a note last month, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill pointed out IAC's historical ability to outperform the broader market, noting longer-term investors are likely to be rewarded despite near-term challenges.</p><p>Their styles might differ, but Messrs. Buffett and Diller both have faced skeptics claiming they were either just lucky or had lost their touch. It has paid to take the other side of that bet.</p>",
