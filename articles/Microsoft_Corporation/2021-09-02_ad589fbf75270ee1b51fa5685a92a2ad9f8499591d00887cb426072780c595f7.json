  "text": "<p>Not finding a product that would solve the problem, Ms. Davidson taught herself to sew and created her own fix—a strap that would hold the cup to a child's seat or stroller.</p><p>The straps—dubbed SippiGrips—were nylon webbing with ribbon sewn on top for some detail. But the material was so smooth that cups kept slipping out of the fabric.</p><p>She did more experimenting, and by 2007 was ready to enter the grips in a contest for the QVC shopping channel. (Along the way, she took some time off to settle into a new job as a recruiter for Microsoft.)</p><p>Ms. Davidson didn't win the contest but decided to give herself one last shot, at a baby-products trade show. \"OK, this is it,\" she recalls thinking. \"If people don't like it, I'm letting it go.\"</p><p>As it turned out, she sold out of SippiGrips halfway through the show, and Target offered to put the product on display through a program for products invented by parents. BooginHead was born.</p><p>In the early days of the company, Ms. Davidson worked at her day job and then spent her nights on BooginHead, packing boxes in her garage for Amazon. She left Microsoft in 2010, when her business hit $1 million in sales.</p><p>Over the years, she has expanded her product line, and now her biggest seller is a universal pacifier holder that clips safely to children's clothing. In 2019, her total sales hit $5 million, and were a little under that figure for 2020.</p><p>Looking at how far she has come, she says: \"Frustration is often the mother of invention. It was a simple problem that needed to be fixed. I knew I was going to create something.\"</p><p>Ms. Davidson, now 47, was brought up by entrepreneurial parents who often said: \"It is better to work for yourself.\"</p><p>As a single mom of two boys, one 17 and the other 13, she is grateful that during the pandemic her sons can see her working, just as she watched her parents. The boys have even been part of office projects.</p><p>\"My youngest son loves to hear about conversations I have with my employees and gives me new product ideas. My oldest used to watch 'Shark Tank' with me and we would pause on certain parts so he could give his opinion about their pitch and how they could do better. I think both in their own way see what I am doing and how hard I am working and appreciate me more because of it,\" she says.</p><p>Ms. Haislip is a writer in Chatham, N.J.
