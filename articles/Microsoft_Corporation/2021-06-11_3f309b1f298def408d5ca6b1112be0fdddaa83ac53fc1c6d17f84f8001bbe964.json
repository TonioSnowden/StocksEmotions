  "title": "Business News: American To Invest In Air Taxi Company",
  "text": "<p>The world's largest carrier by traffic said it would buy as many as 250 of Vertical's planned flying taxis as airlines and financiers look to back the nascent technology, with its partners in the venture taking potential orders to 1,000.</p><p>American said the aircraft, which are electric and take off and land vertically like helicopters, could zip customers around congested cities to get to and from airports. But that could be a long way off. Vertical plans to conduct the first test flight of its VA-X4 aircraft later this year, and American's order is contingent on the aircraft's approval by regulators and other milestones.</p><p>Vertical said its aircraft will hold four passengers and a pilot and fly at speeds of up to 200 miles an hour with a range of over 100 miles. Vertical said it aims to begin commercial operations in 2024 once European regulators sign off.</p><p>Several companies are trying to develop and sell electric flying taxis, and Vertical is the latest to go public by merging with a blank-check company.</p><p>Embraer SA on Thursday said it is in talks to combine its air-taxi arm with a special-purpose acquisition company and this week announced a deal to sell as many as 200 of its flying taxis for use in the U.K. market.</p><p>Vertical said Thursday it will go public through a combination with a SPAC in a deal that values the combined entity at $2.2 billion. The company's other investors include large manufacturers such as Honeywell International Inc. and Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC., along with Microsoft Corp.'s venture-capital fund, Vertical said.</p><p>Avolon, an aircraft leasing company, has agreed to preorder up to 310 aircraft from Vertical with an option for 190 more. Virgin Atlantic has options to purchase 50 to 150 aircraft. American's deal also includes options to buy an additional 100 aircraft. Vertical said it would work with American on passenger operations and developing infrastructure in the U.S.</p><p>---</p><p>Doug Cameron and Andrew Tangel contributed to this article.</p>",
