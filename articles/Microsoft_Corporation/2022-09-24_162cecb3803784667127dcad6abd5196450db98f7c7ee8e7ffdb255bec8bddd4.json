  "text": "<p>   Over the past year, the tech world has been abuzz about the metaverse. Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Microsoft are investing billions. But there's a metaverse that has been up and running for decades. It's called Second Life. It was created by small San Francisco company Linden Lab. There, people have started businesses, built homes, and fallen in love -- all as avatars. </p><p>   In a new four-part podcast series from The Journal, producer Annie Minoff heads back into that largely forgotten virtual world to tell the story of the metaverse we already have, and what it reveals about the one that's coming. </p><p>   She talks to the founder of Linden Lab and early employees, and she meets people who have had lives in this world for years. Episodes of \"How to Build a Metaverse\" will publish over the next four Fridays at wsj.com/podcasts, on Spotify, and on your favorite podcast player. </p><p></p>",
