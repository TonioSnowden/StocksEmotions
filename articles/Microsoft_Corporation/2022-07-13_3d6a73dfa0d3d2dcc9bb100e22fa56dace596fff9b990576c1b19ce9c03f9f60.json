  "text": "<p>Philadelphia-based Gopuff announced its layoff plans in a Tuesday note to investors, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. It also said it plans to shut 76 of its warehouses, covering roughly 12% of its network. The company cut 3% of its workforce in March. The note from Gopuff said the additional cuts are an attempt to get ready for tougher times \"as we prepare for what could be a much more significant macroeconomic downturn than we are experiencing currently.\"</p><p>The company said it would make investments that drive more profit, including technology to run ads on its app, and continue to focus on overseas markets such as the U.K. that are leading revenue growth. Gopuff said it hopes to become profitable in 2024 on the back of these changes.</p><p>Gopuff, founded in 2013, leads the instant-delivery market in the U.S.</p><p>Investors raced to pour money into fast-delivery startups during the pandemic as customers grew accustomed to ordering household essentials online. Many startups that promised delivery in under 15 minutes piled up fast losses and some folded within a year.</p><p>Microsoft said it is cutting a number of positions, affecting less than 1% of its total workforce. Microsoft, which employed about 181,000 people as of June 2021, is making the cuts as a part of a regular adjustment at the start of its fiscal year, a spokesman said. The company's overall workforce will still rise in the coming year, he said.</p>",
