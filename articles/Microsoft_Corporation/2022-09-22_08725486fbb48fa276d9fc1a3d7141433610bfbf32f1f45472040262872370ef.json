The conditions that propelled its decade-long boom are coming to an end. </p> <p>But in the September sun of the French Riviera, the mood is brighter. </p> <p>Thousands of private equity executives are gathering in Cannes this week for <strong>IPEM</strong>, an annual industry conference. And their conversations have been, at times, bullish. </p> <p>“Private equity is a megatrend. I don't know if you know that — it is,” <strong>Blackstone</strong>'s <strong>Verdun Perry</strong> said at the event on Tuesday, adding that “when the markets stabilise it will be a tremendous time for private equity”.</p> <p>Speaking privately, another senior figure told DD's Kaye Wiggins: “The golden age of private equity is just beginning.”</p> <p>It's not that the beachside event, where dealmakers can chat during the day on a balcony with a sea view and party into the night on a boat and on the sand, is without its sceptics.</p> <p><strong>Mikkel</strong> <strong>Svenstrup</strong>, chief investment officer at <strong>ATP</strong>, even compared the private equity industry to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f480a99c-4c7b-4208-b9dd-ef20103254b9\">pyramid scheme</a>. On the conference's main stage he said buyout groups are increasingly selling companies to themselves and to peers, on a scale that “is not good business”.</p> <p>And <strong>Matt Wilson</strong>, from <strong>Oaktree</strong>'s special situations group, said that as a distress-focused investor he was “very excited about what we see in front of us right now”.</p> <p>Still, most of the dealmakers — at least in front of their investors and potential investors — appeared confident about the industry's future. </p> <p><strong>George</strong> <strong>Osborne</strong>, the UK's former chancellor, was in attendance in his capacity as a managing partner of his brother's venture capital firm <strong>9Yards</strong>, which has previously invested in the now-troubled crypto firm <strong>Coinbase</strong>. (Osborne <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/056fdae7-2e69-47bf-8eb5-29947ed1daa2\">still works</a> at <strong>Robey Warshaw</strong> too.) </p> <p>He said the war in Ukraine, the energy crisis, inflation and supply chain bottlenecks are “very real and immediate problems and in the case of Ukraine a tragic problem”.</p> <p>However, he added, “It's important if you're investing as we do for the longer term . . . that you have to see through some of these issues. Some of the investment cycles will get longer, some of the returns will be delayed, but the fundamentals . . . are still there.”</p> <p>One reason to be cheerful was the prospect of huge growth in retail investments in private equity, a theme discussed in several of the conference's sessions. There was even talk of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11549c33-b97d-468b-8990-e6fd64294f85\">pitching continuation funds</a> to mom-and-pop investors — despite the fact that plenty of people even in finance would struggle to explain what they are and how they work. </p> <p>Democratisation of private equity is coming, Blackstone's Perry said. “It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.”</p> <h1>The French are coming!</h1> <p><strong>Xavier Niel</strong> has no shortage of business interests in France. </p> <p>The French tycoon who leveraged his telecoms empire to become a start-up investor also co-owns French newspaper <strong>Le Monde</strong> and a <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/travel/travel-guides/news/a33124/heights-of-luxury-courchevel-france/\">five-star hotel</a> in the ski resort town of Courchevel. His partner is <strong>Delphine Arnault</strong>, the daughter of France's richest man and heir to the<strong> LVMH </strong>fortune.</p> <p>But Niel, who earlier this year found himself <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef64c888-6ad4-47f0-92f3-07d9f05d47f8\">among a parade of billionaires</a> questioned by French senators on their influence over the media sector, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8df0f111-51c8-407e-bea0-0a4f826605b6\">is leading the charge</a> of international buyers eager to snap up stakes in struggling UK assets.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the telecoms billionaire <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e6ca67b-704f-408a-832c-290336201c4f\">scooped up</a> a 2.5 per cent stake in <strong>Vodafone</strong>, a move that could foreshadow further shake-ups by Niel at the underperforming UK group.</p> <p>He's not the only French dealmaker being drawn to the UK as political headwinds, high inflation, low investment confidence and a weaker currency make for attractive opportunities.</p> <p>French telecoms billionaire <strong>Patrick Drahi </strong>amassed an 18 per cent stake in British telecoms group<strong> BT </strong>last year, breeding speculation that he could eventually seize full control over the company. A similar deal came two months ago when France's state-backed satellite group <strong>Eutelsat</strong> said it was buying satellite internet company <strong>OneWeb</strong>.</p> <p>Prime market conditions may not be the only reason Niel is making a play for Vodafone.</p> <p>In February, the British group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3859006-7bda-4cf3-aeb4-2fce3d52ef30\">rejected</a> a more than €11bn bid for its Italian business by Niel's <strong>Iliad </strong>and private equity fund <strong>Apax</strong>.</p> <p>Nevertheless Vodafone's boss, <strong>Nick Read</strong>, has been under pressure from activist <strong>Cevian Capital</strong> to spin off its underperforming units and be more aggressive in driving consolidation in congested markets such as Spain, Italy and the UK. </p> <p>The British telecoms group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4f9aac3-94f0-4d4b-ae9b-5b9e97fbc2d1\">was revealed</a> to be in talks with domestic rival <strong>Three UK</strong>, but that deal has yet to materialise. Nor has Read's claims that Vodafone is actively pursuing “several in-market consolidation opportunities” for the company “including Italy”.</p> <p>Niel's 2.5 per cent stake could potentially pave the way for the dealmaker to attempt another takeover attempt of Vodafone's Italian arm, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e3f96fa-e39e-4c1b-ae69-58b047953370\">as Lex notes</a>, or mark the beginning of a broader plan to increase his stake in the mobile carrier and attempt to squeeze out more value.</p> <p>Niel has dabbled in activism before, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b00881d-a783-46e0-bc95-ea217328bd4b\">leading the campaign</a> for a strategy shift at shopping mall group Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield in 2020. As valuations continue to suffer in Britain, there's never been a better time to stage a coup d'état. </p> <h1>The Finnish power group nursing a multibillion-dollar burn</h1> <p>Few recent deals have proved as disastrous as Finnish energy group <strong>Fortum</strong>'s acquisition of German utility <strong>Uniper </strong>for €7bn.</p> <p>The Düsseldorf-based group has been teetering on the brink of insolvency following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting Germany's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2190babb-1cb8-49f1-a9d5-2c9d98539de9\">decision on Wednesday</a> to nationalise Uniper.</p> <p>The €29bn cost for the Uniper bailout makes it the biggest corporate rescue in Germany's history and one of the largest in Europe since the financial crisis — giving Uniper's advisers at <strong>Rothschild</strong> and the German government's at <strong>Lazard</strong> a hefty workload.</p> <p>Fortum has little choice but to accept its fate. Russia's stopping of gas deliveries forced Uniper to buy gas on the open market at sky-high prices, bringing it to near-collapse. </p> <p>It's unlikely to be the last energy bailout in Europe: Fortum itself accepted a €2.4bn liquidity backstop from the Finnish state this month.</p> <p>Having €6bn wiped out is hardly cause for celebration for Fortum (it had also received dividends of about €900mn from Uniper during its ownership). Its shareholders reacted with relief, however, sending the shares up more than 10 per cent. </p> <p>Fortum's advisers at <strong>Barclays</strong> and <strong>Perella Weinberg</strong> were able to glean profits off the deal, at least.</p> <p>The Espoo-headquartered company has now become what investors had always hoped it would be — a Nordic utility focused on carbon-free power.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>McKinsey </strong>has hired <strong>Microsoft</strong>'s former chief digital officer <strong>Jacky Wright </strong>as its first chief technology and platform officer.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Chelsea Football Club</strong> <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2022/09/20/chelsea-sack-senior-executive-claims-sexual-harassment-inappropriate/\">has fired </a>commercial director<strong> Damian Willoughby</strong> for sending “inappropriate messages” before starting his job, according to The Telegraph.</p></li>  <li><p>Billionaire <strong>Sir</strong> <strong>Leonard Blavatnik </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9aa4c347-9bb4-4688-a35e-de929307b695\">has hired</a> <strong>Robert Kyncl</strong>, previously <strong>YouTube</strong>'s chief business officer and a former<strong> Netflix </strong>executive as the new chief executive of <strong>Warner Music</strong>.
