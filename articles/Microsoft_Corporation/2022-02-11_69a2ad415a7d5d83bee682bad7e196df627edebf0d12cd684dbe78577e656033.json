  "text": "<p>   ADELAIDE, Australia -- KoBold Metals, a startup backed by Bill Gates's Breakthrough Energy Ventures that aims to use artificial intelligence to find metals needed for the electric-vehicle boom, raised $192.5 million in its latest financing round, according to two people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Investors in the Series B funding round for the Berkeley, Calif., company included Sam Altman's Apollo Projects and Mary Meeker's Bond Capital as well as mining giant BHP Group Ltd. and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Canada's largest pension fund, one of the people said. </p><p>   Angel investors included Scott Belsky, chief product officer at Adobe Inc., and Lyft Inc. President John Zimmer. Existing backers Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Equinor Ventures, the startup investing arm of Norwegian energy giant Equinor ASA, also joined the round. </p><p>   KoBold, founded in 2018, says it can change the way minerals are discovered by mining data for clues about where deposits of cobalt, copper, nickel or lithium might be found in the Earth's crust. </p><p>   KoBold says it uses AI to guide where to procure land, what data to collect, and where to drill. It has collected publicly available data from company disclosures and government sources, as well as historical information from companies it partners with. Its algorithms then crunch that data in search of patterns. </p><p>   Global mining companies say exploring for metals is getting tougher as demand is accelerating for materials used in the transition away from fossil fuels. As a result, they expect to look for new deposits much deeper beneath the surface or in countries that pose greater risks to their business, including through resources nationalism. </p><p>   Investors worry the world is on track for large shortages of battery materials that could hinder the shift toward a low-carbon economy. </p><p></p>",
