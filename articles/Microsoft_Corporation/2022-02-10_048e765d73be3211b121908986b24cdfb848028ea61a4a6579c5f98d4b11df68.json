  "title": "Senate Approves Bill Barring Forced Arbitration in Sexual-Assault, Harassment Claims; Some lawmakers want to ban such clauses for other complaints, such as racial discrimination",
  "text": "<p>The White House said in a statement earlier this month that Mr. Biden strongly supports the bill and wants to work with Congress to pass legislation addressing mandatory arbitration more broadly, including on claims regarding racial discrimination, wage disputes and labor practices.</p><p>Mandatory arbitration clauses typically are found in the fine print of everything from employment contracts and credit-card agreements to ride-share disclosures and leases. They block consumers and employees from raising claims in court, instead sending them to arbitrators who work to resolve complaints privately.</p><p>The companies that put such clauses in their contracts argue that arbitration is more efficient, but consumer advocates say that the confidential system helps businesses evade public accountability.</p><p>Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) said she has tried for years to get a blanket ban on mandatory arbitration, but businesses have resisted.</p><p>\"We know that for decades, big corporations forced women to arbitration when they brought actions for sexual assault. That is repulsive,\" Ms. Warren said. \"I hope it is the first step in banning other compulsory arbitration practices\" on issues such as racial discrimination, she said.</p><p>Several big companies, including Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Microsoft Corp. and Uber Technologies Inc., in recent years have said they would end requirements for employee sexual-harassment claims to be handled in private arbitration.</p><p>The bill voids existing mandatory arbitration clauses in cases of sexual assault and harassment and bans future ones.</p><p>The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has expressed concerns about the bill, saying in a letter to lawmakers last year that the legislation was overly broad, and that arbitration \"provides a fair, effective, and less expensive means of resolving disputes compared to going to court.\"</p><p>Not all senators were enthusiastic about the bill's passage, despite the voice vote.</p><p>\"I think it should be renamed the trial lawyers bonanza bill,\" said Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas). \"Having access to a jury trial, a court of law, isn't necessarily the only way or even the most efficient or cost effective way of resolving disputes,\" Mr. Cornyn said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What impact would barring mandatory arbitration in cases of sexual assault and harassment have on the workplace? Join the conversation below.</p><p>He said lawmakers need to make sure that arbitration agreements are fair, but he warned the legislation could be a first step in an effort to eliminate all contractual arbitration. Mr. Cornyn said that \"would be a huge disservice.\"</p><p>Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.), a lawyer, said he doesn't have concerns about frivolous suits. \"There is some abusive litigation, but it's very expensive to bring a frivolous claim. And if you bring too many of them as an attorney, you're not going to be an attorney very long because A, you will be sanctioned and B, you'll go broke.\"</p><p>He said he still expects some people filing complaints of sexual assault and harassment to choose arbitration, since the bill gives them a choice.</p><p>Write to Lindsay Wise at lindsay.wise@wsj.com and Jess Bravin at jess.bravin+1@wsj.com</p><p>Senate Approves Bill Barring Forced Arbitration in Sexual-Assault, Harassment Claims</p>",
