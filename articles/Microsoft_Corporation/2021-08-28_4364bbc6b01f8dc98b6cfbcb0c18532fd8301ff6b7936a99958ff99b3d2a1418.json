  "title": "Business World:  Let a Biden Rethink Include Antitrust  ----  By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.",
  "text": "<p>   \"Young people always want radical solutions.\" I won't mention what person on what Laurence Olivier-narrated documentary series said these words sheepishly accounting for his youthful political affiliations. </p><p>   Maybe one day Joe Biden's Federal Trade Commission head Lina Khan will offer a similar concession in her dotage. Ms. Khan, now 32, made her name with a 2017 law-student article arguing that Amazon should be broken up because it should be broken up. Now she's getting to put her urges to work, first with Facebook, and we can already anticipate the results: </p><p>   Unless a judge puts the case out of its misery, it will drag on for a decade; the technological and commercial issues will quickly become moot; only fixerdom will derive any real benefit, in the form of billings. And Ms. Khan will long since have departed to become a leading ornament of Washington's antitrust bar, its least productive interest group. When you see a volunteer in yellow vest picking up trash by the roadside, think: That person is doing more for the commonweal than all the antitrust lawyers put together. </p><p>   All this we can know because we've seen the movie before, thanks to previous generations' struggles with IBM and then Microsoft. </p><p>   In 2003, under the auspices of the Brookings Institution, economists Clifford Winston and Robert Crandall went looking for evidence that antitrust enforcement benefited the public. They found none. And there's been no revolution since that would alter this conclusion. Think back to the Justice Department's pointless attempt to block AT&amp;T's acquisition of Time Warner, which has since unraveled for its own reasons. The department's case served to show only how a serious person, Trump appointee Makan Delrahim, can be reduced to saying inane things under the bureaucratic compulsions that drive antitrust today. </p><p>   Yet this function of government Mr. Biden has chosen to double down on, with a ludicrously sweeping executive order, and hiring more people in the Lina Khan mold, like Columbia's Tim Wu and lawyer Jonathan Kanter, whose lucrative career has consisted of suing this year's deep-pocketed enemy of the people, Google, on behalf of last year's deep-pocketed enemy of the people, Microsoft. </p><p>   \"We have laws. Those laws are in place. Let's enforce them. Let's enforce them regularly with vigor, with passion, creativity and meaning,\" Mr. Kanter recently insisted, as a plumber might insist more people try flushing more diapers down more toilets. </p><p>   If antitrust laws were written today, they would be written very differently. In the 1890s, never-before-seen forms of large industrial enterprise were first besmirching the American landscape; now we have businesses of all sizes. We have impossibly fecund capital markets spawning new business models to challenge every kind of incumbent. We have tort law, consumer regulation, labor regulation, environmental regulation. </p><p>   Nothing lends itself to abuse, though, like antitrust's treatment of every proposed merger as a potential violation, a power used routinely to monkey around with the private sector without accountability. Now Ms. Khan wants to apply this leverage to the economy wholesale. With a record number of deals happening, she has ordered the corporate universe to come to a halt. As her agency misses deadline after deadline for vetting transactions sometimes as small as $93 million, she threatens firms that if they proceed (as they are entitled to do) her agency may file lawsuits in coming years to unravel deals long after they've been integrated. </p><p>   She told Congress, in woke code, \"I am deeply concerned that the current merger boom will further exacerbate deep asymmetries of power across our economy.\" </p><p>   Here she imbibes a short-lived literature claiming that oligopolies have been permitted to overtake our economy despite armies of state and federal trustbusters. In record time, this literature has been debunked by a corrective literature. Such arguments are shown to misconstrue the impact of new national and online business models, which have meant that Americans at the end of any country road now have more of the world's cornucopia at their fingertips than a Manhattanite did two decades ago. </p><p>   The senility of the modern state is often portrayed as dangerously incurable. But history suggests there's hope upstairs, in politics. Look closely and Ms. Khan has a lot more in common with those hopelessly plodding airline route adjudicators that Jimmy Carter put out of business in the 1970s than she cares to admit. In today's merger wave, a dynamic corporate sector is proving to anybody with open eyes that her agency can't go on doing what it has always done. </p><p>   Our politicians often disappoint, but I suspect if forced to choose between the FTC's self-regard and a functioning economy, today's would make the same decision Mr. Carter did. Which contains an irony: Mr. Biden, for reasons sadly apparent, increasingly is compared to Mr. Carter. As his presidency loses luster, all the more reason to note that Mr. Carter got one big thing right. </p><p></p>",
