  "title": "FirstFT: Economists predict multiple US interest rate rises by end of 2023",
  "text": "<p>Elevated inflation will compel the Federal Reserve to raise US interest rates at least twice by the end of 2023, according to a new poll of leading academic economists for the Financial Times.</p> <p>The inaugural <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de778e1b-3876-4999-942e-186c2a692a1a\">survey</a> conducted by the FT and the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business points to a potentially more hawkish path for monetary policy than indicated by the Fed's chair, Jay Powell.</p> <p>The economists' views align closely with the “dot plot” of Fed officials' own forecasts for when and how quickly rates will have to rise from their current level near zero, as the US economy rebounds from the pandemic and inflation runs ahead of the long-term average targeted by the Fed.</p> <h2>Five stories in the news</h2> <p><strong>1. US home prices rise at fastest pace in more than 30 years</strong> US home price growth accelerated in April <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88b4102f-a6d1-473a-8920-5e98b45661ae\">at the fastest pace</a> in more than three decades. In a separate survey, which covers 20 US cities, Phoenix, San Diego, and Seattle reported the highest year-over-year gains. </p> <p><strong>Go deeper</strong> Why are housebuilders' shares not rising in line with rising house prices? Today's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ee34cb0-7f13-479c-bf3a-1282183915fd\">Unhedged email</a> explains. (Sign-up <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/pages/newsletters/584573e552860d000491cdb8/subscribe/success\">here</a>)</p> <p><strong>2. Microsoft and Google end truce on legal battles </strong>The end of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4fcea11-fc92-45c8-994c-be08cb0e1055\">six-year agreement</a> clears the way for direct conflict between the two Big Tech groups. Under the agreement, the companies had settled outstanding lawsuits and agreed not to litigate or complain about each other to regulators without first trying to resolve disagreements at the highest level internally.</p> <p><strong>3. NYC mayor's race thrown into chaos</strong> The New York mayoral race was thrown into confusion yesterday after the city's board of elections admitted it had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ce4639c-6d96-4b69-9d82-e1ae25f65e48\">bungled the count</a> by including more than 130,000 test ballots in its latest tally of votes. The blunder, linked to the trial of new software, unleashed a torrent of abuse on social media on a city agency that has long had a reputation for dysfunction.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>4. Deutsche Bank Hong Kong IPO licence to expire after staffing error</strong> The German lender will be unable to sponsor initial public offerings in Hong Kong from July after it failed to replace <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/324d2182-5ab0-4de9-88c8-72537d50d2f9\">two regulated staff on time</a>, disrupting the company's plans to relaunch its Asia equities business. The error means the IPO sponsor licence of Deutsche Securities Asia, the bank's regional equity capital markets division, will lapse from next month.</p> <p><strong>5. England send Germany out of Euro 2020</strong> England won their first knockout game at the European championship without the aid of a penalty shootout since 1968 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb9d2550-74fa-48f2-afcc-b9661d652bc6\">by beating Germany 2-0 at Wembley</a>. The victory sets up a quarter-final for England against Ukraine in Rome on Saturday. <em>Follow all our Euro 2020 coverage </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46ee1264-f3a0-4212-9576-e908d47b8607\"><em>here</em></a><em> and sign up to </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/scoreboard\"><em>Scoreboard</em></a><em> for weekly updates on the business of sport.</em></p> <h1>Coronavirus digest</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Half the population of <strong>Australia</strong> was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8e2a356-8568-44e7-8219-3884e51ee70e\">under lockdown</a> today after four big cities reintroduced restrictions.

But news of his departure did little to move the company's stock price or dent its $1.7tn market value. The market's shrug was testament, perhaps, to investors' trust in the corporate machine Bezos built over the past 27 years — and in his replacement, Andy Jassy.</p> <p><strong>Monetary policy is not the solution to inequality </strong>Should central banks do something about inequality and, if so, what?
