  "text": "<p><strong>Deliveroo</strong> hiked year-end sales targets after fears of a post-lockdown collapse in food delivery demand proved unfounded. But the company also cautioned that increased investment would hold back on profitability. </p> <p>Gross transaction value in the second quarter beat expectations at £1.7bn, up 76 per cent year on year. The out-turn was a slight slowdown from the 94 per cent growth reported for the first quarter but still allowed for an increase of annual guidance. </p> <p>For the full year Deliveroo targeted growth from between 30 and 40 per cent to between 50 and 60 per cent. </p> <p>However, the full-year gross margin will be in the lower end of the previously communicated range, the company cautioned. It cited an acceleration of discretionary investments and a reversion of the average order value back to pre-Covid levels.</p> <p>Deliveroo shares closed at a record high of 320p on Wednesday though are still 17 per cent below the 390p issue price on its March flotation.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Persimmon</strong> said it was accelerating cash returns to shareholders on the back of strong trading. The housebuilder said in a trading update that it performed well during the first half of the year, delivering new home sales completions approaching the levels achieved in the first half of 2019. Shareholders will now receive a single one-off 110p dividend in August rather than two payments in the calendar year as previously planned.</p> <p>Ladbrokes owner <strong>Entain</strong> said its full-year earnings will beat expectations. The bookmaker targeted annual ebitda in the range of £850m to £900m after reporting an 11 per cent rise in first-half gaming revenue. Entain also said it was doubling investment in its in-house games studios.</p> <p><strong>Watches of Switzerland</strong> set out a long-term plan to accelerate growth in the UK, US and European markets. The luxury watch retailer's 2026 strategic plan earmarked capital expenditure of between £300m and £340m and up to £200m for acquisitions as management seeks to enter Europe and take a share of the fragmented US market. Full-year results from Watches of Switzerland showed operating profit up 69.5 per cent to £81.9m on revenue up 13.3 per cent to £905.1m.</p> <p><strong>Great Portland Estates</strong> said it had collected 86 per cent of its rent roll for the June quarter. An acceleration in inquiries earlier in the year has translated into healthy leasing activity, particularly for prime Grade A property and flexible offices, the Central London developer said.</p> <p><strong>Electrocomponents</strong> said recent trading has been very strong across all its regions, though higher freight costs remain a problem. The electronics distributor posted like-for-like revenue growth of 37 per cent for the first quarter ended June. </p> <p>Retailer <strong>WHSmith</strong> said that based on stronger than hoped trading in North America it anticipates “a small improvement to management's expectations for the current financial year”. At a group level second-quarter revenue was 58 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, it said. </p> <p>Companies and accountants have&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3e36981-9a70-41d7-b822-4c2d119e7f89\">attacked sweeping plans to overhaul</a>&#xa0;UK <strong>auditing and corporate governance</strong> following financial scandals, claiming the changes would stifle businesses' growth and increase costs. The Quoted Companies Alliance, which represents small and medium-sized listed companies, said the cost of “overburdensome regulation” was already shrinking public markets and the reforms risked “worsening the situation”.</p> <p>The UK government has asked the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/226d30cd-f091-4994-8a3c-da9a27bd4120\">nation's biggest lenders</a> to help come up with swift solutions to the <strong>cladding crisis</strong>, which has left as many as 2m people unable to sell their homes in the wake of the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire. Downing Street sought the views of top industry executives on the problem, which has frozen a substantial chunk of the property market and left many leaseholders facing huge costs for fire safety measures.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>Former US president Donald Trump said he would&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86c98f3b-7d25-42b9-abf6-68b4b0839c66\">lead class actions</a>&#xa0;against <strong>Facebook, YouTube and Twitter</strong> as well as their chief executives Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai in lawsuits alleging “unlawful censorship” of Americans.</p> <p>US antitrust enforcers&#xa0;have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03dd917c-15ba-4832-8214-591ac330c35a?emailId=60e67847f60ecc000479c326&amp;segmentId=22011ee7-896a-8c4c-22a0-7603348b7f22\">mounted their first challenge</a> to a mobile app store, accusing <strong>Google</strong> of overcharging developers who sell through the Play store that is built into its Android operating system.</p> <p>The $50bn <strong>Gates Foundation</strong> has&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6bd52f7e-f8bb-4de6-800c-0112c035da3c\">announced a plan</a>&#xa0;that would allow Melinda French Gates to resign as co-chair of the charity and receive “personal resources” from her estranged husband for her own philanthropic effort if she or Bill Gates decided they could no longer work together.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Bryce Elder</strong> <br>The success of its direct listing has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5364606a-5275-497b-a985-eb238a890776\">awarded currency broker Wise</a> a punchy valuation that is in contradiction to its lopsided ownership structure and stated desire to win friends rather than maximise shareholder returns.</p> <p><strong>The Editorial Board</strong> <br>Private equity provides <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8abc707-ced0-4864-be90-50e130552525\">a useful function</a> in any ecosystem but should not be allowed to feast unfettered.&#xa0;The UK should investigate limiting the amount of leverage deployed and revisit shelved plans to tighten rules around carried interest.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Deliveroo raises targets as demand hold up' FT.com 8 July.
