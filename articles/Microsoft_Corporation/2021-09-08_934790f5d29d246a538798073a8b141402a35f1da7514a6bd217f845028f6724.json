  "text": "<p>The start-up behind the world's biggest direct carbon capture plant said it would build a much larger facility in the next few years that would permanently remove millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p> <p>As Zurich-based Climeworks opened its Orca “direct air capture” project in Iceland on Wednesday, co-chief executive Jan Wurzbacher told the Financial Times it had started design work on a facility 10 times larger that would be completed in the next few years.</p> <p>Orca will collect about 4,000 tonnes of CO2 a year and store it underground — a tiny fraction of the 33bn tonnes of the gas forecast by the IEA to be emitted worldwide this year, but a demonstration of the technology's viability.</p> <p>“This is the first time we are extracting CO2 from the air commercially and combining it with underground storage,” Wurzbacher said.</p> <p>The Orca plant sells the most expensive carbon offset in the world, costing as much as €1,000 a tonne of CO2 removed and counting Microsoft founder Bill Gates among its customers.</p> <p>Wurzbacher said commercial demand had been so high that the plant was nearly sold out of credits for its entire 12-year lifespan, prompting the accelerated development of the much larger plant using the same technology.</p> <p>Orca's other customers include Swiss Re, which recently signed a $10m carbon removal deal with the plant, as well as Audi and Shopify.</p> <p>Some energy models show the world will need to be removing billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere a year by the middle of the century to meet net zero emissions targets.</p> <p>Critics of direct air capture say the technology is too expensive and consumes too much energy to operate at a meaningful scale.&#xa0;</p> <p>But its profile has been rising, with US President Joe Biden's recent infrastructure bill including $3.5bn for four direct air capture hubs.&#xa0;</p> <p>Climeworks' rival Carbon Engineering, a start-up based near Vancouver, is developing a plant in Texas with Occidental Petroleum that aims to extract up to 1m tonnes of CO2 a year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Because the atmosphere is just 0.04 per cent carbon dioxide, extracting it can be time-consuming and energy intensive. </p> <p>Wurzbacher said the Orca plant, which is powered by geothermal energy, was more efficient and used fewer materials than Climeworks' earlier technology — “it is really the next step up”.</p> <p>Orca uses dozens of large fans to pull in air, which is passed through a collector where the CO2 binds with other molecules. The binding substance is then heated, which releases the carbon dioxide gas.</p> <p>To mark Wednesday's opening, a tank full of carbon dioxide collected from the air was injected underground, where it will mix with water and eventually turn into rock as it reacts with a basalt formation, locking away the carbon.</p><p>Source: Leslie Hook 2021 'World's biggest ‘direct air capture' plant starts pulling in CO2' FT.com 8 September.
