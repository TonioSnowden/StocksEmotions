  "text": "<p>The Novavax vaccine is protein-based and comprises two shots taken just three weeks apart. There are hopes it may appeal to some vaccine-hesitant people, as it uses more conventional technology than the shots developed by Moderna MRNA and Pfizer PFE and BioNTech BNTX.</p><p>However, the U.S. vaccine program has slowed to a crawl with the numbers getting either primary shots or booster doses remaining static for weeks, based on data from the CDC (see below). The shot is also aimed at the original strain of the virus, which has quickly been replaced by newer variants, including omicron and its many subvariants, which are now dominant. Moderna and Pfizer are working to develop vaccines specifically targeting omicron.</p><p>The World Health Organization said Thursday that BA.5, an omicron subvariant that is understood to be more infectious than other subvariants, accounted for 50% of new cases sequenced in the month through July 10 and has been detected in 89 countries.</p><p>In its weekly epidemiological update, the agency said cases rose for a fifth straight week in the week through July 10 with more than 5.7 million being reported.

And the positivity rate on COVID tests stands at 18%, the highest since Feb. 1.
