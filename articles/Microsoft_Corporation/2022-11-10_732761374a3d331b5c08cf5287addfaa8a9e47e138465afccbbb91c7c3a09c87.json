  "text": "<p>Joe Biden said he wants to run for a second term in the White House and will make a final decision early next year after his political prospects were boosted by the Democrats' stronger than expected performance in the US midterm elections. </p> <p>“Our intention is to run again. That's been our intention, regardless of what the outcome of this election was,” the president told reporters yesterday, adding he would talk to his wife Jill about a new presidential campaign between Thanksgiving and Christmas.</p> <p>The Democrats avoided sweeping defeats in Tuesday's midterm elections but still risked losing control of both chambers of Congress to the Republicans as Americans declined to hand either party a strong political mandate. </p> <p>If Biden decides to run for re-election in 2024, it sets up a potential rematch with Donald Trump. The former president dropped his heaviest hint yet this week that he was preparing another run at the White House as well when he trailed a “very big announcement” next Tuesday. </p> <p>But the success of Ron DeSantis in Florida has complicated a potential rerun by the one-term Republican president. DeSantis was re-elected with a bigger majority providing a platform for a potential run at the White House by the 44-year-old Republican governor in 2024. </p> <p>Trump is reportedly being told by advisers to delay next Tuesday's announcement until after the results for the Georgia Senate seat become clearer. The contest between the Trump-backed candidate Herschel Walker and incumbent Raphael Warnock is expected to go to a run-off on December 6.</p> <p>Many of Trump's chosen candidates <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15837a32-a1b5-4d80-8c1a-7dd39ccf790b\">did not perform as well as expected</a>. He endorsed more than 300 congressional and state-level candidates in an attempt to reclaim the political stage and assert himself as the Republican party's kingmaker.</p> <p>Instead, in many races, it was Democrats who outperformed expectations. Political pundits had predicted before the election that the economy and inflation would turn independent voters off the president's party and into the arms of the Republicans. But the Supreme Court's decision in June to overturn the Roe vs Wade ruling on reproductive rights galvanised many women across the country to vote in favour of Democrats, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e79d0a5b-0590-4d68-9b8e-9697b716bcc1\">according to exit polls and early vote tallies</a>. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11764091.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Business leaders, meanwhile, see a divided government as a cause for celebration. “There's huge opportunity for bipartisan collaboration,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management professor with strong chief executive connections. Here are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3428b2bc-a2d8-4df3-9247-20e1aaff2de8\">some of the areas</a> where business is hoping for bipartisan co-operation.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Live event: </strong>Join Edward Luce, Rana Foroohar, James Politi and veteran commentator Norm Ornstein for an exclusive webinar on the midterm results later today. <a href=\"https://usmidtermelections.live.ft.com/home?reference=ftnewsletter&amp;utm_source=emh&amp;utm_medium=ftnewsletter&amp;utm_campaign=2022pusmidtermelections\">Register for free here</a> and submit your questions in advance for our panel.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For the latest results, go to </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a2ef26f-e50b-4a4f-b103-c4fd263ea60e?source=homepage\"><em>our results map</em></a><em>.

FTX on the brink after Binance abandons rescue </strong>FTX is close to collapse after rival crypto exchange Binance <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/593cad86-683c-4444-ac7b-c5c875fb4d95\">ditched an eleventh-hour rescue</a>. Sam Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old founder of FTX, is racing to secure billions of dollars to halt a liquidity crisis that emerged earlier this week. FTX needs $8bn to steady the ship, according to people with knowledge of the matter, after talks with Binance failed. Meanwhile, the price of Bitcoin fell heavily again today and is now below $16,000.</p> <p><strong>2. Goldman promotes 80 new partners in most diverse class ever</strong> The Wall Street bank has named <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da92dc10-c69f-42d5-930f-639b87e3bffb\">record numbers of female and black partners</a> in the class of 2022 in an effort to boost its diversity and broaden its business beyond its core investment banking and trading divisions under chief executive David Solomon. </p> <p><strong>3. Russia orders retreat from Kherson </strong>Russia's defence minister Sergei Shoigu has instructed troops to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/350159c1-c88b-402e-8770-44e70c422dc1\">withdraw from the strategic city</a> in southern Ukraine. The retreat robs the Kremlin of its biggest military achievement in Vladimir Putin's nine-month invasion and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/396db8b9-87c3-4b31-8b78-3c14ffcba3a7\">expands Kyiv's options ahead of winter</a>.</p> <p><strong>4. Elon Musk outlines payments vision for Twitter </strong>The new Twitter owner laid out his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e11dcf7-3879-4a51-b921-fc30722d6adb\">long-term vision for bringing payments</a> to the social media platform, which could include offering high-yield money market accounts, debit cards and peer-to-peer transactions. The comments are the strongest signal yet of Musk's ambition to transform the business he bought for $44bn into an “everything app” modelled on China's WeChat.</p> <p><strong>5. Paul Allen's art collection fetches record $1.5bn at auction </strong>Artwork amassed by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27df38a4-0e7b-45ab-827f-bd530689304a\">has broken the sales record for a single collection</a>, fetching $1.5bn at a Christie's auction in New York in a sign that art market valuations remain robust despite global economic headwinds. Last night's auction of 60 lots was the first of two sales, with the remaining 95 artworks set to be sold later today.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>US inflation </strong>US consumer prices <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d93c771-ee91-40a6-a878-be120d59f43c\">are expected to have jumped yet again</a> in October, bolstering the Federal Reserve's case for pressing ahead with more interest rate rises. Economists polled by Refinitv have forecast a 0.6 per cent increase in the consumer price index from September to October, slowing the annual rate to 8 per cent from 8.2 per cent. </p> <p><strong>Mexico rates </strong>Banxico officials are expected to raise Mexican interest rates by 0.75 percentage points, taking the central bank's policy target rate to 10 per cent, according to a consensus estimate compiled by Refintiv. Yesterday, the National Institute of Statistics and Geography said Mexican consumer prices increased by 0.57 percentage points in October, bringing down the annual rate to 8.41 per cent from 8.7 per cent.</p> <p><strong>Monetary policy </strong>Officials from the Federal Reserve will be speaking after the latest inflation data is released. Philadelphia Fed president Patrick Harker will discuss the economic outlook before the Philadelphia chapter of the Risk Management Association. Elsewhere, Dallas Fed president Lorie Logan and Kansas City Fed president Esther George will appear at an energy conference co-hosted by their banks that will focus on geopolitics and the outlooks for the global energy markets and the US energy sector. </p> <p><strong>Company earnings </strong>Alternative investment firm Brookfield Asset Management, co-working space company WeWork, and Tapestry, the parent group of Coach and Stuart Weitzman, all report earnings before the opening bell. Talent and media group Endeavor will report after the market closes.</p> <h1>What else we're reading and listening to</h1> <p><strong>Spyware affair tarnishes Greece's image </strong>A mysterious wiretapping scandal is threatening the remarkable progress achieved since Greece's debt crisis in the 2010s and suggests that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dea354b8-fbeb-4a06-bbaf-833fa8134605\">not everything is hunky-dory</a> in the post-crisis politics of the southern European country, writes Tony Barber.</p> <p><strong>Psychedelics and business could make for a bad trip</strong> From mushroom-derived psilocybin to LSD, and mescaline to ayahuasca compound DMT, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4da607e4-c2af-4002-ab96-cfe79269aff2\">“psychedelic renaissance” is in full swing</a>. But Jemima Kelly warns that brash investors are clashing with mind-altering drug therapy pioneers.</p> <p><strong>‘Frankenfoods' or a fix for climate change?</strong> The European Commission is considering easing the regulation of gene editing in agricultural production. The process involves deleting or adding genes from similar crop species. But critics say it is an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/337ba132-cc33-42a9-9df3-cd53114200bc\">untested risk being pushed by big companies</a>.</p> <p><strong>The unlikeliest World Cup ever </strong>Was Qatar's quixotic bid <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/669d442e-3274-4a79-a58c-e1ca282c1d84\">to host the Middle East's first World Cup this year worth it</a>?
