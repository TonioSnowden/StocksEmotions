  "title": "Business News:  GM Set to Produce  Electric Versions  Of Famed Corvette  ----  By Joseph De Avila",
  "text": "<p>   General Motors Co. is developing a hybrid version of its Chevrolet Corvette that could hit dealerships as early as next year. </p><p>   A fully electric version of the sports car is also in the works, said company President Mark Reuss. </p><p>   Further details will be released at a later date, he said. Mr. Reuss made the announcement in a LinkedIn post Monday following an appearance on CNBC. </p><p>   A spokesman for GM didn't specify whether the first electric Corvette would be a hybrid with an electric motor and gasoline engine that doesn't require plugging in or a plug-in electric hybrid model. </p><p>   GM's Corvette announcement comes as legacy auto makers race to produce more electric vehicles to compete with Tesla Inc. The Detroit auto maker said it is working to surpass Tesla in terms of EV sales and is investing $35 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025. </p><p>   GM said it would invest nearly $6 billion in Michigan alone to produce electric pickup trucks. It is also splitting the cost of a $2.6 billion battery factory with partner LG Energy Solution. The company didn't say where the electric Corvettes would be assembled. </p><p>   The auto maker was dealt a setback at expanding its electric vehicle business when it halted production of the Chevrolet Bolt last year to fix a battery defect that could lead to fires. GM said it would resume production this month. </p><p>   Still, sales of electric vehicles remain a fraction of overall vehicle purchases, accounting for less than 2% of GM's and Ford Motor Co.'s overall sales in 2021. </p><p>   GM is also working with Honda Motor Co. on jointly developing a line of affordable electric vehicles, including compact sport-utility vehicles, The first of the vehicles would likely be priced below $30,000 in the U.S. but won't be ready until 2027, the companies said. </p><p>   The starting price of a 2022 Corvette Stingray is $60,900, according to the Chevrolet website. </p><p>   The company also said Monday that it has developed an energy-recovery system that takes heat generated from the batteries of its electric vehicles to warm the inside of a vehicle more quickly than vehicles with a traditional combustion engine. The energy-recovery system can also increase the driving range of electric vehicles by 10% and boost acceleration, the company said. </p><p>   Corvette aficionados can be sensitive to major alterations of the vehicle. </p><p>   Getting some dedicated Corvette fans to try something new -- especially an electric vehicle -- will be a challenge for General Motors, said Keith Cornett, a fan who runs a blog about the car. </p><p>   \"Some of them are very reticent on these [electric] cars, he said. </p><p></p>",
