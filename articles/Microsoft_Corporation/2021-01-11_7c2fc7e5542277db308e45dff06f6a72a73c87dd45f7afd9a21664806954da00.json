  "title": "Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Quarterly Analysis  ---  In Translation:  Explaining Brobdingnagian Base  ----  By Simon Constable",
  "text": "<p>   When investors first hear the term \"Brobdingnagian base\" they might be taken aback. Not only is it a mouthful, it is a literary reference that seems unrelated to finance. </p><p>   But understanding what the phrase means could be beneficial because some analysts use it to describe potentially large profit-making opportunities in markets. </p><p>   Coined in the early 2000s by John Roque, now a technical analyst at Wolfe Research in New York, the term draws from Jonathan Swift's classic novel \"Gulliver's Travels\" --  Brobdingnagians are the giants who live in the fictional country of Brobdingnag. Base, meanwhile, refers to a bullish chart pattern where the price of a security or other asset has moved sideways for a period. </p><p>   The longer the sideways price action has gone on, the bigger a subsequent rally is expected to be. So-called Brobdingnagian bases are those that have lasted for many years and thus are pointing to the potential for a gigantic rally. </p><p>   One historical example of a Brobdingnagian base: Microsoft Corp., which moved sideways from 1999 to 2016. In 2016, it finally broke through the previous all-time high of around $60 reached in 1999. \"At that point, people thought of it as a stodgy old tech stock,\" says Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at New York-based broker-dealer Bay Crest Partners. After the $60 price was breached, the stock continued to rally to more than $220 recently. Simply put, the 17-year-long Brobdingnagian base was a precursor to an almost fourfold jump in the stock price. </p><p></p>",
