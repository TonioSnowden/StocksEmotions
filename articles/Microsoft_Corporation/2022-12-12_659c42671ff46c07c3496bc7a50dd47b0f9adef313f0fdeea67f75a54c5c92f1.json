  "title": "Microsoft Buys Stake in London Stock Exchange; The deal reflects the growing symbiosis between big tech and financial markets",
  "text": "<p>The deal brings together one of the U.S.'s biggest tech companies with Europe's biggest market exchange, combining the former's cloud-computing and conferencing software with the latter's growing batch of financial data.</p><p>\"We are building substantial new products together on an entirely different scale\" from prior partnerships, LSEG Chief Executive Officer David Schwimmer said on a call with analysts. \"We will be investing together. We will be designing products together. We will be going to markets together.\"</p><p>LSEG shares were up 1.8% Monday afternoon in London.</p><p>The deal reflects the growing symbiosis between big tech and financial-markets companies.</p><p>Last year, Alphabet Inc.'s Google invested $1 billion in futures-exchange giant CME Group Inc. and struck a deal to move the company's core trading systems to the cloud. Weeks later, Nasdaq Inc. announced a deal to begin moving its North American markets to Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Web Services cloud-computing platform.</p><p>\"It seems Microsoft (and the LSE) don't want to be left out,\" said Niki Beattie, CEO of consulting firm Market Structure Partners.</p><p>For tech companies, these deals guarantee a steady stream of cash from exchanges for the use of cloud services, she said. In addition to the $2.8 billion that LSEG has agreed to spend on the Azure cloud, Microsoft expects to earn an additional $2.2 billion over 10 years from traders, investors, and financial advisers who do business with the LSEG and also use the cloud, it said.</p><p>For exchanges, the deals allow them to make greater use of data and reach a broader set of customers. \"The use of data and processing is ramping up so significantly that it will be hard to move forward at pace if they are not thinking about how to re-platform their offerings on the cloud,\" Ms. Beattie said.</p><p>The LSEG has staked its future on selling data, a way to diversify away from the low-margin stock-exchange business. In 2021, it completed the purchase of financial-information and terminal business Refinitiv Holdings Ltd. from a consortium of Blackstone Inc. and Thomson Reuters Corp.</p><p>Microsoft is taking the unusual step of buying an ownership stake in a client—it will acquire the LSEG shares from the Blackstone-Reuters consortium. Microsoft didn't disclose how much it would pay for the shares.</p><p>Judson Althoff, Microsoft's executive vice president and chief commercial officer, said the equity stake made sense given how long and closely the two companies will be working together.</p><p>Mr. Schwimmer said the equity stake aligns incentives between LSEG and Microsoft and allows the consortium to move forward with a plan to sell its LSEG stake. \"We don't need capital—we generate a lot of cash flow—and we don't have any need to sell equity,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Althoff compared the potential new products that emerge from the partnership to a Zoom video call that allows participants to pull up research notes, share documents, and type into a group chat all at once. Financial advisers will be able to do that using LSEG's data with one screen, he said.</p><p>\"This will revolutionize the way financial advisers provide advice to their clients,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Josh Mitchell at joshua.mitchell@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft Buys Stake in London Stock Exchange</p>",
