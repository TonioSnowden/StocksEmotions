  "text": "<p>Fitzgerald upgraded Activision's ATVI stock to overweight from equal weight Monday on the heels of a Politico report from last week that indicated the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was likely to file an antitrust suit to block the deal with Microsoft MSFT.</p><p>\"Though the antitrust landscape remains uncertain, we believe ATVI's current price is neither reflective of its prospects as a standalone videogame publisher nor of MSFT's outstanding bid of $95 [per] share,\" Fitzgerald wrote in his note to clients.</p><p>He commented that Activision shares look undervalued as the market fails to appropriately \"consider the impact of a $3 [billion] breakup fee,\" underappreciates Activision's standalone potential and possibly miscalculates the likelihood that the deal will actually go through.</p><p>\"We are optimistic about ATVI's standalone prospects given a record-breaking \"Call of Duty\" launch ($1 [billion] in sell-through within the first 10 days), strong engagement in \"Overwatch 2,\" and continued strength in Mobile (despite bearish commentary from other major mobile game publishers),\" Fitzgerald wrote.</p><p>He also noted that Activision has a \"broad portfolio of wholly owned [intellectual property],\" strong traction with PC gamers and compelling opportunity brought on by its mobile investments.</p><p>He kept his $95 price target on Activision's stock, which is up 1.2% in Monday's premarket action. That $95 target is the same as Microsoft's buyout price.</p><p>Truist Securities analyst Matthew Thornton also turned bullish on Activision's stock Monday morning, writing of a \"favorable risk-reward\" balance in the shares.</p><p>The company \"should have a big 2023,\" Thornton wrote, citing, among other things, the health of \"Call of Duty,\" \"World of Warcraft\" and Blizzard's mobile business.</p><p>He further commented that Activision \"has an overcapitalized balance sheet.\" Thornton estimates that the company will have more than $10 billion in net cash by the end of 2023, or more than $12 billion to $13 billion when including breakup fees. The company could conduct a \"significant buyback,\" he said.</p><p>Thornton upgraded the stock to buy from hold, adding that the company has the strongest slate of near-term releases among a basket of videogame publishers.</p><p>Activision stock looks undervalued with or without a Microsoft deal, says analyst</p>",
