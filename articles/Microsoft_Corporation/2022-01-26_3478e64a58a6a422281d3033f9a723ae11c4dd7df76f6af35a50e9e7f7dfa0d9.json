  "title": "‘Raising taxes on working families is the last thing we should do during a pandemic': Senators press Biden to extend child tax credit",
  "text": "<p>“Without the expanded credit, nearly 10 million children will be thrown back into or deeper into poverty this winter, increasing the monthly child poverty rate from roughly 12% to at least 17%,” wrote Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Raphael Warnock of Georgia and Ron Wyden of Oregon in a letter on Wednesday to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.</p><p>“After historic progress,” the senators wrote, “it is unacceptable to return to a status quo in which children are America's poorest residents and child poverty costs our nation more than $1 trillion per year. Raising taxes on working families is the last thing we should do during a pandemic.”</p><p>As MarketWatch has reported, the&#xa0;monthly payments of up to $300 per child&#xa0;began on July 15 and&#xa0;ended with the payout on Dec. 15. At a news conference last week marking his first year in office, Biden said, “there's two really big components that I feel strongly about that I'm not sure I can get in the package. One is the child-care tax credit. The other is help for the cost of community colleges.”</p><p>Read:Biden suggests he can't bring back monthly child tax credit payments</p><p>Biden's so-called Build Back Better package has stalled amid opposition to elements of it from Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat. Manchin has suggested the payments would be used to buy drugs and has pushed for including a work requirement. In their letter, the senators cite Census Bureau data showing that “91% of low-income families spent their payments on basic necessities like groceries, utilities, housing, and school-related costs.”</p><p>The president is making a new push for Build Back Better on Wednesday, hosting at least 10 private-sector executives who are expected to “highlight what they see as the key benefits of BBB for the American economy and American businesses,” according to a White House official. Those slated to attend include General Motors GM CEO Mary Barra,&#xa0;Microsoft MSFT President Brad Smith and Salesforce.com CRM CEO Marc Benioff. &#xa0;</p><p>Now read:As Biden meets with CEOs on stalled Build Back Better plan, analysts ‘believe a $1T+ package is probable'</p><p>MarketWatch's Victor Reklaitis contributed to this story.</p>",
