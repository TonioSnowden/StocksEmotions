  "title": "Apple Warns of Production Delays  ---  iPhone maker posts  12-month profit near  $100 billion despite  disappointing sales  ----  By Tim Higgins",
  "text": "<p>   Apple Inc. on Thursday reported quarterly results that showed how supply-chain problems are tripping up even some of the biggest business winners of the pandemic era. </p><p>   Apple, which had record 12-month profit nearing $100 billion, warned that supply chain disruptions are hindering iPhone and other product manufacturing and would bring increased challenges during the important holiday shopping quarter. Apple shares fell 3.7% in after-hours trading. </p><p>   The pandemic lifted the businesses of tech giants in its early stages because people who stayed at home during lockdowns needed more of their products. But as the pandemic's economic disruption has drags on, it is creating problems that even the strongest companies are struggling to reckon with. </p><p>   Late last year, the automotive industry was left scrambling to untangle supply-chain woes. Computer-chip shortages dented factory output and contributed to a steep drop in third-quarter profits for General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. Meanwhile, shortages of dishwashers and refrigerators are likely to stretch well into next year, Whirlpool Corp. said. </p><p>   The Covid-era pain has expanded to other industries beyond manufacturing as well, leaving stores and restaurants looking for workers and weighing price increases. McDonald's Corp. is raising menu prices to keep pace with rapidly growing costs, with wages increasing 10% so far this year at its U.S. restaurants. </p><p>   Kraft Heinz Co. can't keep up with demand for kids' meals and other flagship products and said that similar hurdles would remain in the coming months. </p><p>   Some companies saw revenue and profits expand even as the challenges intensify across many industries. Microsoft Corp. shares have risen about 5% this week after the company reported continued growth in its cloud-computing unit. Alphabet Inc.'s Google nearly doubled its profit in the third quarter as its ad business withstood market changes that had crimped earnings for social media companies. </p><p>   For Apple, the effects of the disruption are comparably new. Chief Executive Tim Cook had largely helped the tech giant navigate the turbulent waters of the pandemic and avoid a hit to its financial results during the past year as other companies struggled with chip shortages. </p><p>   But that changed in the summer. In July, Apple cautioned a global shortage of computer chips would extend to its iPhone production. </p><p>   In actuality, the supply- chain disruptions during the fiscal fourth quarter were worse than expected, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said. The problems were two- fold: the chip shortage roiling everyone and an unanticipated spike in Covid-19 cases in Southeast Asia that affected manufacturing. </p><p>   Revenue fell short of analyst expectations. After the market closed Thursday, the company reported total revenue of $83.4 billion for the July through September quarter, a 29% rise from a year earlier but lower than the $85 billion expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet. The company's profit rose in line with expectations to $20.6 billion in profit for the quarter, or $1.24 a share, from $12.7 billion a year earlier. </p><p>   During the first three quarters of its fiscal 2021, from October 2020 through June of this year, Apple earned $74 billion. That is already far more than what was previously its best entire year, in fiscal 2018, when the company's profit totaled $58.5 billion. </p><p>   Even before the results were released, investors were concerned about how supply-chain issues might affect Apple's important holiday quarter. </p><p>   There are multiweek waits in some areas for delivery of certain models of the iPhone and other products, and even with supply chain delays, investors are eager to see if the continued allure of 5G technology and new camera capabilities will help fuel another big year. </p><p>   Mr. Maestri acknowledged that wait times for some Apple products were longer than they would like. Supply constraints during the fiscal fourth quarter hurt potential revenue by $6 billion, he said, and will be worse in the current period. </p><p>   Mr. Maestri said the iPhone maker still expects to see year-over-year revenue growth during the period that ends in December. \"We fully expect to set a new December quarter record for revenue,\" he said. \"But we also expect the supply constraints will be greater than the $6 billion. . . . We expect most of our product categories to be constrained during the December quarter.\" </p><p>   Some investors argue Apple is naturally going to see a tougher year in fiscal 2022 and, to make their case, they point to previous years that followed the company benefiting from hot iPhone introductions that have resulted in larger than normal results. Others see continued momentum from 5G. </p><p>   Apple is expected to have delivered a record 238 million iPhones in the past fiscal year, according to analysts' estimates. They expect 233 million this year. The company doesn't disclose unit sales but, during the first nine months of the fiscal year, iPhone revenue rose 38% to $153 billion. In the July-to-September quarter, iPhone revenue rose 47% to $38.9 billion, missing the $41 billion expected by analysts. </p><p>   The strength of Apple's other products throughout the Covid-19 pandemic has helped fuel record profit. The company has benefited from workers and students at home wanting new laptops and iPad tablets. </p><p>   Those results continued to grow in the fiscal quarter. Sales of Mac computers rose 1.6% to $9.2 billion while iPads rose 21% to $8.3 billion. Analysts had expected growth of 1.3% by Macs and 6.6% by iPads during the period compared to a year ago. </p><p>   Since the pandemic began, disrupting normal operations, Apple has stopped giving detailed guidance. </p><p>   Investors are also looking at how Apple is dealing with rising costs associated with increasing inflation. The newest iPhones didn't have a starting price jump when revealed in September, though the company has benefited from higher selling prices in part because of deals being offered by cellular phone service providers in the U.S., which are fighting to keep customers. </p><p>   Mr. Cook's success navigating the turbulent waters of the Covid-19 pandemic helped Apple lead other big tech companies in enjoying outsize profits during uncertain times. That success and broader questions about the power of these tech companies have also put them under scrutiny. </p><p>   Apple emerged mostly unscathed from an antitrust lawsuit in September brought by Epic Games Inc. that centered on its App Store's role as the gatekeeper for customers on its iPhones and its required in-app payment system that gives it as much as a 30% cut of digital revenue. </p><p></p>",
