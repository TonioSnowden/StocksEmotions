If they are unable to do this, then they will face a worsening situation in their own security,” he told Russian state news agency Ria.</p> <p>Nato warned Moscow to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/426889a6-4fe9-4897-b923-6b3f546c5878\"> abandon its belligerent foreign policy</a> on the eve of today's talks and co-operate with the west or face a military alliance steeled for conflict.</p> <p>Jens Stoltenberg, Nato secretary-general, told the Financial Times the US-led defence pact was prepared for “armed conflict in Europe” should negotiations fail, as officials <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1311bb7-7083-4491-89d7-2912289ebe68\">readied for discussions</a>. </p> <p>Today's bilateral talks in Geneva involving Wendy Sherman, deputy secretary of state, and Ryabkov are the first in a series of diplomatic meetings this week aimed at de-escalating the situation in Ukraine. They will be followed by talks in Brussels on Wednesday between Russia and the 30 members of Nato and on Thursday the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe will host talks in Vienna.</p> <p><em>Do you think the US and Russia can de-escalate the Ukraine crisis?

New York City apartment fire kills 19</strong> Hospitals worked through the night to save the lives of people gravely injured by smoke in a fire that killed 19 people, including nine children, in a Bronx apartment building, Associated Press reports. An investigation into the cause of the fire was ongoing, New York City's mayor Eric Adams <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85bec79a-fa70-40c8-8395-1b8ea7d7f718\">told reporters last night</a>.</p> <p><strong>2. Novak Djokovic wins appeal</strong> The world's top male tennis player has won his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa52db75-46b3-4cea-bd72-c08d5f7a7160\">appeal against deportation</a> from Australia after a judge ruled that the country's border authorities had acted unreasonably when they cancelled his visa.

Figures released on Friday showed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73c26e1b-ebf6-4dd4-9930-132c01db6929\">sharp slowdown</a> in the number of new jobs in December but that the unemployment rate plunged to the lowest level since before the pandemic.</p> <p><strong>4. Bill Gates-backed fund aims to invest $15bn in clean tech</strong> Breakthrough Energy Catalyst plans to mobilise as much as ten times an initial investment of $1.5bn from philanthropists and companies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f25fd95d-e2d8-43f8-b786-1552a1f0059e\">to bring down the cost of clean-tech products</a> such as green steel and green hydrogen. </p> <p><strong>5. China tech stocks rally</strong> Chinese tech stocks rallied earlier today after starting the year with a week of sharp falls. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech index <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b60bcab6-376a-4fdd-abb6-e5fdb6bbaa91\">gained as much as 2.5 per cent</a>, with Alibaba Health Information Technology rising as much as 14 per cent and short-video platform Kuaishou's Hong Kong-listed shares advancing 12.2 per cent. The Star 50 index of Shanghai-listed tech stocks climbed about 1 per cent.</p> <h1>Coronavirus digest</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Citigroup</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf6e69bc-a3d5-4885-a598-144ce88c7dfe\">will fire</a> US employees at the end of January if they have not been vaccinated or received an exemption, according to a person briefed on the matter.</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ae36643-6868-4448-80ac-3fdbc32f2324\">Reinfections</a> are rising among people who caught Covid-19 earlier in the pandemic as the <strong>Omicron </strong>variant spreads.
