  "title": "Close Email, Open Netflix. How TV Replaced the Commute as a Workday Wind-down; Pre-Covid, office workers used commutes to decompress after a stressful day. Now, stuck at home, we're immersing ourselves in TV drama to detach from job dramas. Here's how to max out the benefits.",
  "text": "<p>SAMANTHA LEFAVE used to walk home from her office in downtown Denver every day. For those 20 minutes, the 31-year-old content marketer was unavailable on email. Often, she'd put on headphones and pull up music or a podcast to ensure her mind didn't wander to thoughts of deadlines.</p><p>When the pandemic took hold, however, Ms. Lefave's \"commute\" shrank to the distance between her home office and the sofa. In search of a stress-relief alternative, she now streams an episode or two of \"Survivor\" once her workday is done. \"TV has become the signal that it's time to relax,\" she said, adding that she doesn't even walk her dogs until the Tribal Council renders a verdict.</p><p>Though many of us complained about traffic and train delays, our work commutes—be they by foot, car, train or bus—gave us a buffer between work and life. Intentionally or not, we often used the time alone to do important mental work. We shed the fiercely focused mind-set that makes us good bosses or salespeople. Alone in our cars or lost in headphones, we created space for the gentler traits of a parent or spouse. A favorite show might have a similar effect, said Charles Spence, a professor of experimental psychology at the University of Oxford and the author of \"Sensehacking: How to Use the Power of Your Senses for Happier, Healthier Living.\" Television, as he explained, \"captures our attention and perhaps stops us ruminating about that last bad meeting or work problem. It may also modify our mood or give our attention time to recharge.\"</p><p>For many in the cubicle class, commutes might be over for good. A Pew survey released last December revealed that 71% of people were doing their jobs from their kitchens, living rooms and home offices. And it seems unlikely that in-person work will ever fully return to pre-pandemic levels. According to a 10,000-person survey conducted in May and July sponsored by the University of Chicago and other research institutions, 76% of Americans said they hope to never again spend five days a week inside an office. A similar number said they expected their employers to honor the wish.</p><p>With the loss of our commutes, we've developed new routines to replicate their effects. Earlier this year, Microsoft upgraded its Teams software with a \"virtual commute\" feature that dials up a Headspace meditation session at your scheduled log off time. Coping tips, like those Forbes magazine shared this past February, encourage Americans to bookend their days with \"fake commutes\" that can include walks, stretches or car rides.</p><p>Increased TV viewership suggests another change in routine. Data from analytics firm Nielsen revealed that between December 2019 (when Covid-19 cases were first reported) and October 2020, weekly television time increased by more than two hours for work-from-home professionals. A partial explanation: daytime viewing. Some workers run the news all day or use a TV to fill the silence in their home office, Nielsen said. But evening viewing was up as well, perhaps tellingly. A workplace drama like Netflix's \"The Chair,\" which follows the clash between Ivy League professors and their woke students, packs in enough fictional tension to make you forget about your own real-life stresses.</p><p>If TV is absorbing the function of a work commute for you, psychologists say there are ways to maximize its meditative properties. \"What you really want to do is create an emotion in your home,\" said Mr. Spence. He suggests you feed multiple senses to create a truly transporting experience.</p><p>In other words, don't just rely on the sights and sounds of FX's \"What We Do in the Shadows.\" By supporting the viewing experience with soothing smells and soft materials, you can really leave your office behind—even if you're not physically going anywhere.</p><p>For some, an evening-only drink supplies the sensory shift needed to fully ease into an episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" After leaving his home office each day, Joe Poor, a 39-year-old mortgage loan originator in Greenville, S.C., walks a few strides to his kitchen and mixes a cocktail. The menu changes depending on what's in his garden, but lately, he has been using a bumper crop of mint to make mojitos and mint juleps. The Pavlovian beverage has conditioned him to flush work from his mind the way a commute once did, and once he and his girlfriend have their mojitos in hand, they make dinner before pulling up Lorelei and Rory's misadventures to complete the decompression.</p><p>\"We keep our routine very regimented,\" said Mr. Poor. \"That two-hour block of time—or however long we watch television—is how we unwind.\" And there's a lot less traffic.</p><p>Transporting Strategies</p><p>When the workday ends, these tools can help you Netflix and really chill.</p><p>UnHide Lil' Marsh</p><p>One reason pets are so effective at relieving stress: Touching the soft fur sends safety signals to your brain, says Mr. Spence, of Oxford.
