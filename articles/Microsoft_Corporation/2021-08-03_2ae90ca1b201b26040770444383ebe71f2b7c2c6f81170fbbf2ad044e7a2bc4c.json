  "text": "<p>In September 2017, Hurricane Irma ripped through the British Virgin Islands causing widespread devastation. Guests on Sir Richard Branson's 74-acre private island cut their trip short, but the Virgin boss hunkered down in a wine cellar with around 60 staff, drilling holes into the shutters to reduce the force of the air.</p> <p>Inside they could hear coconuts clattering and crashing glass, and when they emerged, Branson likened the damage from the category 5 hurricane to a nuclear blast. Entire buildings had been destroyed, his once-verdant tropical paradise had turned brown as palm trees and shrubs were ripped from the earth and a hot tub was flung some 30 metres into the air.</p> <p>“The bar, TV and furniture in the beach house floated into the tennis court and there was sand halfway up the net,” tennis coach Arthur Hicks tells me as he recalls the devastation during a coaching session.</p> <p>Almost four years on, however, the tennis court is a vision of clubhouse calm. There are jugs of Pimm's and iced tea at the bar and — in an unusual twist — lemurs hovering at the sides of the court like furry ball boys. Across the island, rooms have been restored and lush vegetation replanted. The hot tubs are bubbling gently. The hammocks are swinging in the island breeze and the champagne is on ice. Necker is back in business.</p> <p>I'm among the first guests to experience the island since its restoration and reimagining post-hurricane. Just as reconstruction was completed in April 2020, it closed due to the pandemic. Branson lives on the island, in a large new house with its own pool and tennis court, sometimes mingling and eating with guests, and even giving them a lift in his golf buggy. </p> <p>Unfortunately, I'm not able to sketch out any of my get-rich-slow business ideas for him on a napkin over piña coladas, as during my visit he's in the US preparing to fly to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf3130f4-5f62-4f9d-941a-d1db98dc0233\">edge of space</a>. I'll have to make do with a signed copy of his autobiography that has kindly been left in my room. </p> <p>Branson does tell me later, via email, that he likes sharing his home with guests and that at the bar on Necker Island he often meets people “who are mulling extraordinary new ideas. From Jack Dorsey, who was dreaming up Twitter and invited us to help by investing, or setting up not-for-profit organisations like The Elders or [The] Audacious [Project] — these were all born out of discussions on Necker Island.”</p> <p>The hurricane is just the latest chapter in the island's dramatic story, which has been successfully spun into legend by Branson, complete with jeopardy, glamour and celebrity cameos. Factor in his space programme and there's a hint of the island lair in the Bond film <em>Dr No</em>.</p> <p>Branson bought the island in 1979 for $180,000 without even knowing where the Virgin Islands were, partly, he has said, “to impress a girl”. It was a drastic reduction on the initial asking price of $6m and in 2006 he estimated that the island was worth $60m (estimates are now considerably more).</p> <p>Few destinations can rival Necker for its eclectic assortment of famous guests — I'm told celebrities generally pay for their stay, though Branson has called the island “a wonderful magnet to attract wonderfully interesting people”. Princess Diana stayed with her children in 1990, and a framed letter thanks Branson, tellingly, for “a week I have longed for . . . some peace and quiet within this mad life we lead”.</p> <p>Barack and Michelle Obama visited in 2017, days after the end of his presidency. Whereas luxury resorts have always hoped celebrity stays will help sell holidays, Necker has acted as a halo brand for the Virgin Group's far wider range of interests, from healthcare to broadband.</p> <p>Other visitors to get the pale white sand between their toes include musicians Ronnie Wood, Harry Styles and Mariah Carey, plus Bill Gates, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Jimmy Carter and Kate Moss. Actor Kate Winslet stars in a popular Necker story: in 2011 lightning struck the Great House, a complex of bedrooms, bar and games room on one of the island's hills. It caught fire, and Winslet was hailed as having rescued Branson's late mother Eve, who clarified later that Winslet “took me down four steps”. </p> <p>You don't have to be a Hollywood actress or an ex-president to stay here, but it helps. For much of the year the island is only available on an exclusive-use basis, for up to 40 guests, which will set you back $105,000 a night. The rest of the time (during so-called “Celebration Weeks”), rooms can be booked as with a conventional resort, from $5,150 per room per night. The Great House, home to an open-walled, dark wood hang-out area with a pool table, bar and chandeliers made of ostrich eggs, has 11 rooms and further accommodation is in nine villas dotted about the island.</p> <p>So does $105,000 buy you a dream “vacay”, as an influencer might say? Well, I regret to report that it does. The minute I find myself aboard the speedboat Samsam (named after Branson's son Sam) from Tortola to Necker — drinking champagne to the driver's Eighties megamix like the star of my own music video — more than a year of Covid restrictions, home schooling and a bureaucratic blizzard of pre-flight forms are a distant memory. We whizz past an area of islands ringed with yachts and known by locals as “Billionaires' Playground”, thanks to the tech titans and business moguls who recharge here.</p> <p>Necker is a self-styled oasis of “barefoot luxury”, but in the 1960s it was so inhospitable that when journalist Andrew Alexander and photographer Don McCullin tried to survive on it, Robinson Crusoe-style, for a newspaper article, they gave up after 14 days of snakes, scorpions, mosquitoes, dehydration and prickly pear scratches. Today, it strikes a balance between seemingly wild natural beauty (an illusion) and stylised luxury, which avoids tipping into a Disney version of a tropical island.</p> <p>After a year of virus-dodging in London, having a beach to myself felt priceless. The fine white sand is backed by seagrape, a coastal shrub with round flat leaves and intricately twisted branches; the achingly turquoise water looks like it has been Photoshopped.</p> <p>When Branson bought Necker it was only occupied by wild goats, but now it's a veritable menagerie. A large pond hosts chattering flamingos and scarlet ibis, once native to the BVI and since reintroduced by Branson. A trained parrot squawks “hello”. </p> <p>Giant tortoises were introduced 15 years ago; the oldest one, Umpire, is 72 (a year older than Branson). The lemurs arrived after Branson visited Madagascar in 2012, and decided that they could live and breed freely on Necker.</p> <p>Necker now bills itself as an all-boxes-ticked “sustainable resort playground” (despite the obvious contradictions between a holiday destination that requires at least two flights — frequently undertaken by private jet — and sustainability). In addition to solar panels, three wind turbines were added in 2019, and the island now runs on 90-100 per cent renewable energy. Other moves towards eco-awareness include large tubs of reef-safe sunscreen dotted handily around the island, solar-powered lamps and refillable water bottles everywhere.</p> <p>Executive chef Guillaume Galvez supports local farmers and fisherman, though the architectural inspiration is less locally sourced. Necker's rooms and interiors are inspired by . . . Bali. However, with a bit of suspended disbelief the incongruous Indonesian look and ad hoc Buddha statues work just fine: there are light-filled, tiered houses with their thatched roofs, large stone lamps, white sofas with cushions in zingy shades, lots of carved wood and rattan.</p> <p>The highlight of my room wasn't the veranda overlooking the ocean, or the plunge pool, but the outdoor shower. There are few things more calming than showering alfresco in the gentle island breeze with its percussion of rustling palm fronds. Except perhaps a dip in one of the multiple pools — think swim-up bars with giant underwater rocks as bar stools.</p> <p>While Necker is pretty inaccessible to paparazzi, it's Instagram gold, full of quirky motifs that help convey character. There's the flamboyance of flamingos circling the island at sunset, the lemurs sitting on my shoulder in place of a pirate's parrot, and a classic splash of Necker theatre: the famed sushi-filled kayak, floated out to chopstick-wielding swimming diners.</p> <p>The island has a party reputation — Branson has said that “when Kate [Moss] is on Necker she can usually be seen on top of the Great House table, dancing away day and night” — but the activities are taken pretty seriously too. There's paddleboarding, catamaran sailing, kitesurfing, water-skiing and snorkelling (the water teems with brightly coloured fish). </p> <p>Necker has seen some sporty stunts — Branson arrived for his wedding clinging to a helicopter, one guest kitesurfed off the Great House roof into the sea, and before the hurricane there was a zip wire running from roof to beach.</p> <p>Not wishing to make my own tabloid (or, more realistically, local) newspaper headlines of the “blonde journalist impaled on palm tree on billionaire's island” variety, I kept it tame. A personal highlight was the Necker tennis tournament; coach Arthur has that upbeat knack of making every flailing player who serves underarm like they are flipping a pancake feel Wimbledon-ready.</p> <p>But this isn't the kind of place with timed activities written on a whiteboard; staff are on speed dial to arrange them as and when. The same goes for meals, which can be served anywhere, any time.</p> <p>Fancy something more chilled? How about a beachside massage, or stargazing dip in the rooftop hot tub? Or perhaps some sunset yoga. “Let go of the identity society has placed on you,” murmurs the instructor. Like everyone at Necker, she's well versed in melting away the cares of high-rollers.</p> <p>While I'm not usually part of the jet set, after I reluctantly return to “pingdemic” Britain there is something space-trotting Branson and I have in common. Having been somewhere truly out of this world, I've come back down to earth with a bump.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Carola Long 2021 'Necker Island — inside Richard Branson's Caribbean lair ' FT.com 3 August.
