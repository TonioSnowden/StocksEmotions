  "text": "<p>Given that many industries were in the past reluctant to embrace demanding climate targets (or, as the fossil-fuel industry did, lobbied against them), this at first seems remarkable. A recent analysis of the worldâ|(80)|(99)s 2,000 biggest publicly traded firms found that over a fifth of themâ|(80)|(94)with combined sales of nearly $14trn a yearâ|(80)|(94)have embraced net-zero targets. More than two-thirds of firms selling household and personal products, for example, had made such commitments. In America, about a quarter of the big industrial firms in the S&amp;P 500 index have done so. Some technology giants, including Alphabet and Microsoft, even claim that they will remove from the atmosphere all carbon they have spewed out in their corporate history.</p><p>Although climate ambition is to be applauded, such grand claims need to be taken with a very large pinch of salt, for two reasons. The first is that the terms used by many firms to describe their climate ambitions, which range from â|(80)|(9C)net zeroâ|(80)|(9D) to â|(80)|(9C)carbon neutralâ|(80)|(9D) to â|(80)|(9C)zero emissionâ|(80)|(9D) to â|(80)|(9C)carbon negativeâ|(80)|(9D), are slippery indeed. Innocent bystanders may think these commit a company to make massive reductions in its emissions of GHGs, but that is not necessarily the case. Most companies plan to make some cuts in emissions, which may prove painful and costly, and to achieve the rest of their carbon goal by buying cheaper â|(80)|(9C)offsetsâ|(80)|(9D) (such as credits for renewable-energy projects or for protecting forests that sequester carbon) that vary wildly in quality. This loophole lets firms make green promises without explaining exactly how they plan to clean up their act.Companies will start getting serious about their net-zero goals</p><p>The second reason for scepticism is that most of these commitments are being made for 2040, 2050 or beyond. Given that none of the bosses making these promises is likely to be in charge then, it is worryingly easy for bosses to set ambitious goals for which they will not be held accountable when the time comes. Many firms are also using the long time horizon as an excuse not to specify how their goals will be met, pointing instead to unspecified future innovations that will magically solve the problem. In television advertisements trumpeting its goal of net-zero by 2040, Amazon even acknowledges as much, admitting that â|(80)|(9C)We donâ|(80)|(99)t really know exactly how weâ|(80)|(99)re going to get there.â|(80)|(9D)</p><p>Though there is plenty of scope for scepticism, there are also two good reasons to believe that companies will start getting serious about their net-zero goals in 2022. First, several advances in global regulation and industrial standard-setting are expected, which should expose the charlatans and boost the champions. In response to requests from governments and regulators, the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation in London is helping develop standards on how listed firms should disclose climate-related risks from their operations. The first set of those standards is due to be published by mid-2022. The European Unionâ|(80)|(99)s much-anticipated rules requiring asset managers to disclose how they take environmental issues into account are expected to be published in July. New requirements by regulators in America and Singapore for corporate disclosure of climate-related data are also likely in 2022.</p><p>The other reason for hope comes from the bottom up. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), a voluntary project organised by several environmental and international organisations including the UN, is pushing companies to make serious net-zero commitments that are consistent with the Paris agreementâ|(80)|(99)s goals on containing global warming. The SBTiâ|(80)|(99)s boffins will accredit only those companies that adopt high standards of measurement and disclosure of climate data, and have serious carbon-mitigation plans (offsets of any kind do not count, for example). Firms embracing science-based targets have reduced their combined GHG emissions by a quarter since 2015, whereas global emissions from energy and industrial processes have risen by 3.4% over that same period. Greenwashers, in short, need not apply.</p><p>Vijay Vaitheeswaran: Global energy and climate innovation editor, The Economist, New York</p><p>â|(96)&#xa0;</p><p>This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition of The World Ahead 2022 under the headline â|(80)|(9C)Much ado about nothingâ|(80)|(9D)</p>",
