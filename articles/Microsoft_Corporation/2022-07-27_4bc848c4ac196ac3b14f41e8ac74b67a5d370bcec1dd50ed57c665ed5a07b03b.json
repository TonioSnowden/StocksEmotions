  "text": "<p>After removing traffic acquisition costs, Alphabet's revenue was $57.5 billion, compared with $51.0 billion in the same period last year and the company's overall revenue grew 13% to $69.7 billion. Analysts tracked by FactSet had estimated ex-TAC revenue of $57.6 billion and total revenue of $69.8 billion.</p><p>During the second quarter, Google's total advertising sales were $56.3 billion, up from $50.4 billion in the prior year's quarter. Search revenue was $40.7 billion, up from $35.8 billion in the same period last year.</p><p>See Now: Google stock rises despite an ad downturn, second straight earnings decline</p><p>In a note released on Wednesday, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Shyam Patil said that, while the company is facing macroeconomic pressures, its search business should remain relatively resilient.</p><p>\"GOOGL's 2Q came in better than feared, though management did call out tough 2H comps, macro uncertainty and FX headwinds,\" Patil wrote. \"While GOOGL won't be immune from macro pressures, we continue to believe that search should be one of the most resilient categories of digital spend and provide solid support for the overall business.\"</p><p>Susquehanna, which has a positive rating for the company, lowered its Alphabet price target to $150.00 from $187.50.</p><p>Alphabet's second-quarter results show the power of its search business, according to Truist Securities. \"We remain constructive on GOOGL as the company displayed strong resiliency in 2Q22, delivering virtually in line results and better than feared, powered by search and cloud,\" wrote Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali, in a note released Tuesday. \"We believe that Street expectations are getting to be more reasonable and achievable, paving the way for the stock to start working again.\"</p><p>Truist Securities lowered its Alphabet price target to $145 from $150 but maintained its buy rating.</p><p>Opinion: Google and Microsoft earnings show the bar has been lowered for Big Tech</p><p>Alphabet reported solid results in a tough operating environment, according to Stifel analyst Scott W. Devitt. \"The slight miss on gross revenue was driven by slower-than-expected growth in YouTube, Network, and Other as revenue growth in those segments was impacted by a pullback in demand from some advertisers (stemming from the uncertain macro environment) and challenging prior year comps,\" he wrote, in a note released on Tuesday.</p><p>However, despite near-term headwinds, Stifel is encouraged by the durability of Alphabet's core business, according to Devitt. Stifel maintained its $145 price target and buy rating for Alphabet, but lowered its third-quarter gross revenue estimate to $71.1 billion from $71.8 billion.</p><p>\"Google posted solid results ahead of expectations,\" wrote UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley, noting that ad revenues were better than feared, in a note released on Wednesday. However, uncertainty could remain on overhang on shares in the near term, he added.</p><p>See Now: Big Tech earnings are about to determine the direction of the market</p><p>UBS lowered its Alphabet price target to $132 from $133 and maintained its buy rating.</p><p>The company's second-quarter net income was $16 billion, or $1.21 a share, compared with net income of $18.5 billion, or $1.36 a share, in the prior year's quarter. Analysts tracked by FactSet had estimated net income of $1.27 a share.</p><p>Alphabet shares have declined 25.3% in 2022, compared with the S&amp;P 500 index's SPX fall of 17.0%.</p><p>Of 49 analysts surveyed by FactSet, 45 have an overweight or buy rating and four have a hold rating. The average stock price target is $144.48.</p><p>Google shares rise as search delivers resiliency in tough macro environment</p>",
