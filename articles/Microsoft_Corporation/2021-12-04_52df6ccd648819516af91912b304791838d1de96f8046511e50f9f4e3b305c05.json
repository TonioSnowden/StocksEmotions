  "text": "<p>Twitter Inc.</p><p>Twitter's CEO flew the coop. The social-media company said Monday that Jack Dorsey was stepping down and Chief Technology Officer Parag Agrawal would take the reins effective immediately. The Wall Street Journal reported that the departure was driven in part by investors who were uncomfortable with him running two large, publicly traded companies. He was in charge of Twitter and digital payments firm Square Inc., which is changing its corporate name to Block Inc. Last year activist investor Elliott Management Corp. pushed for changes at Twitter, including potentially adjusting Mr. Dorsey's role. Twitter shares lost 2.7% Monday.</p><p>Microsoft Corp.</p><p>Microsoft investors want more transparency on harassment. Shareholders on Tuesday voted to approve an investor proposal to the company demanding greater disclosure on its handling of sexual harassment cases. The proposal requested an annual report that summarized the number of cases investigated and their resolution, as well as results of any independent investigation into Microsoft's executives, including co-founder Bill Gates. A Wall Street Journal report earlier this year said Microsoft board members pursued an investigation into the billionaire's prior romantic relationship with a female staffer. Mr. Gates stepped down from the board last year. Microsoft shares lost 1.8% Tuesday.</p><p>Exxon Mobil Corp.</p><p>Exxon is powering down its spending over the next five years. The Wednesday announcement from the energy giant coincides with a murky outlook for oil and gas demand, persistent economic risks from Covid-19 and efforts by some countries to wean themselves from fossil fuels. The company said it would maintain lower capital investment levels through 2027, spending between $20 billion and $25 billion a year. That is a 17% to 33% decrease from its pre-pandemic plans. Exxon's plans have been months in the making and aren't an immediate reaction to the new Omicron variant, but they reflect uncertainty about commodity markets as the world attempts to move past Covid-19. Exxon shares ended 0.1% lower Wednesday.</p><p>AT&amp;T Inc.</p><p>One of CNN's biggest stars lost his prime-time spotlight. In a statement released Tuesday, the network said it suspended anchor Chris Cuomo indefinitely after records released by the New York attorney general's office provided a detailed look into his efforts to help his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, respond to allegations of sexual misconduct. The records showed that Chris Cuomo gave detailed feedback on his brother's statements to the press and gathered information about coming stories involving his brother's accusers. Mr. Cuomo's suspension comes as CNN's parent company, AT&amp;T, is preparing to merge its media assets with those owned by Discovery Inc. AT&amp;T shares fell 2.6% Wednesday.</p><p>Salesforce.com Inc.</p><p>Salesforce is sticking by its sales goal. The business-software company on Tuesday reiterated its target of surpassing $30 billion in annual revenue in the next fiscal year, despite issuing a muted revenue outlook that fell short of expectations. Salesforce was a pioneer in offering cloud-based software that became widely adopted during the pandemic, as businesses embraced such tools to function better with remote staff. The company also named Bret Taylor, the company's president and chief operating officer, as co-CEO to work alongside longtime chief Marc Benioff. Salesforce.com lost 12% Wednesday.</p><p>Kroger Co.</p><p>Consumers still have an appetite for dining at home. Kroger reported strong sales for the latest quarter as shoppers continued to opt for home-cooked meals. However, the Cincinnati-based grocer said higher supply-chain costs are squeezing its profit, that it has more inventory today than a year ago and that it incurred significant costs to keep its shelves stocked. Meanwhile, most products are getting more expensive, and Kroger said consumers are becoming price-sensitive and feeling the effects of inflation. The company said it is passing down costs to customers where possible and is choosing to hold down prices in some areas. Kroger shares gained 11% Thursday.</p><p>Write to Francesca Fontana at francesca.fontana@wsj.com</p><p>Moderna, Twitter, Kroger: Stocks That Defined the Week</p>",
