  "title": "FTC, Meta renew battle in federal court over acquisition of VR fitness app maker Within",
  "text": "<p>The FTC claims Facebook parent company Meta META will illegally extend its market power into the nascent metaverse market and that Meta \"had the intentions to enter — and thus was a reasonably probable entrant into — the VR Dedicated Fitness App market,\" according to a court filing.</p><p>A cornerstone of the FTC's strategy is the potential competition theory — in essence, Facebook would have attempted to offer its own VR fitness app if not for the acquisition of Within. FTC initially sued Meta to block the deal in July. [Separately, the agency is trying to unwind then-Facebook's purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014, respectively.]</p><p>Conversely, Meta asserts \"these ideas never proceeded beyond the discussion stage, never received approval from any senior manager, and were all discarded as impractical for various reasons,\" in its filing.</p><p>Meta, which is challenging the commission's decision to target a narrow market, insists it never intended to dive into the metaverse on its own, hence the Within acquisition.</p><p>A star-studded lineup of witnesses is expected during the trial, led by Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, who is pivoting the company into a metaverse force; Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth, who is spearheading the company's VR push; and Within founder Chris Milk.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Edward Davila is presiding over the seven-day federal court trial.</p><p>The FTC's showdown with Meta could foreshadow even more aggressive action from Khan, who made her name in antitrust circles with a seminal paper on the market dominance of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN.</p><p>On Thursday morning, Microsoft Corp. MSFT was sued by the FTC on Thursday over its planned $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard Inc. ATVI.</p><p>\"Microsoft has already shown that it can and will withhold content from its gaming rivals,\" Holly Vedova, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, said in a statement. \"Today we seek to stop Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio and using it to harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets.\"</p><p>FTC, Meta renew battle in federal court over acquisition of VR fitness app maker Within</p>",
