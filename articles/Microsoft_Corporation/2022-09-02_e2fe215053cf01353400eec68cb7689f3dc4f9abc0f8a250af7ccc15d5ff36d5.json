That's because he owns B shares, which have 50 per cent of the voting rights despite his family holding company only owning a 9.1 per cent stake. </p> <p>For Rupert, under whose watch Richemont burnt billions on an<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ffa12ab-b004-4d66-8fe4-b4b0ab9cfcc3\"> unprofitable foray</a> into ecommerce, a shareholder reckoning has been brewing for some time as it fell behind rivals such as <strong>LVMH </strong>and<strong> Hermès.</strong></p> <p>While Bluebell's campaign looks to be a long shot — several top holders of Richemont<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e021cdeb-fd7e-4b21-963e-8844b4ae283a\"> told the FT</a> they don't intend to support their resolutions — there's still the chance of a surprise at the September 7 shareholder meeting. </p> <p>The activist, which has waged successful campaigns at <strong>Danone</strong> and <strong>Hugo Boss</strong>, has already got Richemont to agree to its demand to nominate a board director specifically to represent holders of the listed A shares, something provided for in the bylaws but never applied.</p> <p>A crucial thing to watch will be who gets more votes to represent those A shareholders: former Bluebell partner and luxury industry veteran<strong> Francesco Trapani</strong>, or the Richemont favoured candidate <strong>Wendy Luhabe</strong>? </p> <p>Forcing Richemont and Rupert to contend with its criticism <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed63beaa-b000-45d5-8c07-419421bdc122\">is already a symbolic victory</a> for Bluebell, the FT's Leila Abboud writes, as the big question of who stands to take over his empire hangs overhead. </p> <h1>Bertelsmann attempts to rewrite the book on antitrust&#xa0;</h1> <p>Media is one of many sectors where chief executives grumble about competition rules hampering old industry incumbents' chances at standing up to Big Tech.</p> <p>Where <strong>Thomas Rabe</strong>, the CEO of German media group<strong> Bertelsmann</strong>, stands out is in his willingness to actually gamble on deals that break the barriers of what's traditionally allowed by antitrust law. </p> <p>The reckoning on his dealmaking ambitions — and political clout — will come this autumn, when authorities in the US and Europe decide whether to clear some crucial deals for the book and television industries. </p> <p>Later this year, a US judge is set to rule on the proposed $2.2bn acquisition of <strong>Simon &amp; Schuster</strong> by Bertelsmann's <strong>Penguin Random House</strong> — unless the <strong>Department of Justice</strong>'s star witness <strong>Stephen King</strong> can convince the court that the merged group would, as alleged, wield the market power to drive down advances for expected bestsellers.</p> <p>An even more formidable challenge comes with the potential merger of France's two biggest private broadcasters: Bertelsmann's<strong> M6</strong> and <strong>TF1</strong>, the station backed by the billionaire <strong>Martin Bouygues</strong>.</p> <p>Bertelsmann and Bouygues hardly lack political influence in Paris and other European capitals. Yet for all the influence, the deal looks to be in serious doubt. </p> <p>The case team examining the merger for the French competition authority issued a report concluding the merger would harm competition. Many advertisers and some rivals agree. </p> <p>Rabe's bet is that he can convince the French competition watchdog to look beyond the traditional market definition, which would give the TF1-M6 group more than 70 per cent of the free-to-air television ad market — and take into consideration the rise of YouTube and social media in video advertising.</p> <p>Bertelsmann and Bouygues are armed with some of the best legal and economic analysis money can buy. But, if the history of merger control is any guide, this may be of little help. </p> <p>Competition lawyers struggle to cite examples of cases where competition authorities dramatically changed the definition of a market so a deal could pass. By contrast, there are countless examples of executives who thought they could manage what was said to be impossible. </p> <h1>Politics leave an Italian airline deal up in the air</h1> <p><strong>Mario Draghi</strong>'s government intends to sell <strong>ITA Airways</strong>, the successor of bankrupt airline <strong>Alitalia</strong>, to a consortium led by US private equity firm <strong>Certares</strong>. But there are a lot of complications to get past, if the plan is to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e0fbc2e-17ce-4bf5-b97d-ce58fe481a0e\">take off</a>. </p> <p>As the Italian treasury announced this week that it had entered exclusive negotiations with the group, which also includes <strong>Delta Air Lines</strong> and <strong>Air France-KLM</strong>, the country's rightwing coalition was quick to weigh in, the FT's Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli reports.</p> <p><strong>Giorgia Meloni</strong>, the leader of the rightwing <strong>Brothers of Italy</strong> party which is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4a12f6d-ef7f-494b-acc3-18aba68f864e\">on course</a> to win this month's general election, said the matter was one for the next government to handle — not Draghi's caretaker administration. Senator <strong>Fabio Rampelli</strong>, also a member of the Brothers of Italy, warned no deal should be rushed because there are several issues to be considered, including jobs and the strategic role of Rome's airport.</p> <p>The deal is designed to get lawmakers on board. The private equity-led offer would allow the Italian government to maintain its 40 per cent stake, appoint two board members and wield the power to block certain transactions, according to several people involved in the negotiations.</p> <p>While there's no set end date for the exclusivity period and the new government could scupper the deal, which values ITA Airways at about €1bn, Italian officials and bankers are optimistic that the sale will succeed. </p> <p>Their reasoning? It's unlikely that the new administration would want to spend more taxpayer money on the carrier after Alitalia's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0db1886-5a4b-11ea-abe5-8e03987b7b20\">multiple bailouts</a>, nor be set on a collision course with the <strong>European Commission</strong>, which expects the privatisation to happen sooner rather than later. </p> <p>Meloni's party was strongly opposed to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b6ec845-7205-47ee-864b-9decd2460586\">competing offer</a> led by Germany's<strong> Lufthansa</strong>, but could potentially be swayed to back a bid from Certares that granted her government more influence over corporate governance. </p> <p>There are advantages for both sides. Meloni's ties are stronger in Washington than Berlin. And the partnership with Delta is set to boost ITA's prospects of expanding into the profitable US tourist market.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Starbucks </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db04c6e3-0f2a-410e-b0a8-313dbd5271a6\">has named</a> the outgoing head of consumer goods group<strong> Reckitt Benckiser</strong> as its next chief executive, handing <strong>Laxman Narasimhan </strong>the task of executing a “reinvention” strategy designed by <strong>Howard Schultz </strong>since he returned in April to take charge of the coffee chain for a third time.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Stephan Kuppenheimer</strong> has resigned as chief financial officer of <strong>Blackstone</strong>'s secured lending fund, a decision “based on a desire to pursue other opportunities”.
