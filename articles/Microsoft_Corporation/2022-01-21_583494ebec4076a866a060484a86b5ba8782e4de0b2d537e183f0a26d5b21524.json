  "text": "<p>Between 1999 and 2020 Ms. Hjorth-Larsen worked in various roles at Nordea Bank Abp, including as head of business risk management and governance, according to her LinkedIn profile.</p><p>Swedbank came under scrutiny in February 2019 after a Swedish TV broadcaster reported that billions of dollars of potentially illicit funds may have passed through the bank's Estonian branch.</p><p>The bank credited Ms. Harbo, the current compliance chief, with playing an important role in helping it remedy deficiencies detected during its anti-money-laundering review. Under her management, the compliance department implemented substantial changes aimed at strengthening its controls and processes, the bank said.</p><p>Friday's announcement comes as the Swedish bank continues to deal with investigations from multiple agencies in several countries. U.S. authorities are investigating the bank's historical anti-money-laundering work and information disclosure, according to the bank's interim report for the third quarter, published in October. The probes are progressing and Swedbank is holding discussions with relevant regulators through its U.S. legal advisers, it said in the report.</p><p>The bank in 2020 notified the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control that, following an internal probe, it found potential sanctions violations regarding $4.8 million in transactions.</p><p>Swedbank in October said that it had implemented previously announced governance changes at the bank's Baltic operations, with wholly owned holding company Swedbank Baltics AS becoming the owner of its subsidiary banks in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The bank said this would allow Swedbank AB to formalize the current operating model while increasing accountability and responsibility for the management of its Baltic business.</p><p>Write to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com and Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com</p><p>Swedbank Names New Chief Compliance Officer</p>",
