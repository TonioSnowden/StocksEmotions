  "text": "<p>Blackstone has joined forces with Cascade Investment, which manages Bill Gates's fortune, for a possible £3bn takeover of private jet company Signature Aviation.</p> <p>The tie-up is a major boost to Blackstone's long-running interest in the UK-listed company, as Cascade is already Signature's largest shareholder, and comes as two other private equity firms are circling. </p> <p>Signature's board last month said it was minded to accept a possible offer from Blackstone of $5.17 per share, or £3.83, valuing the company at more than £3bn — a roughly 40 per cent premium to its share price before news of the takeover interest. </p> <p>The US private equity group on Friday said it has now formed a consortium for a possible joint offer at the same price with Cascade Investment, which owns 19 per cent of Signature.</p> <p>Blackstone has been interested in the FTSE 250 listed company for at least two years and is expected to make a firm offer, according to a person familiar with the matter, betting that there is scope for growth in the private jet market even as the pandemic rips through the aviation industry.</p> <p>If a new offer is made, Cascade would contribute its share capital plus cash, via a newly incorporated company owned 70 per cent by Blackstone and 30 per cent by Cascade. </p> <p>The $5.17-a-share bid was Blackstone's sixth since February 2020, and while the parties are in advanced talks there is no certainty a deal will take place.</p> <p>Cascade's decision to join forces with Blackstone comes a day after Signature revealed that private equity firm Carlyle had also expressed an interest in a possible offer, although no proposal has been made. </p> <p>Last month, Signature rejected a rival approach at a lower price than Blackstone's from Global Infrastructure Partners.</p> <p>Formerly known as BBA Aviation — standing for British Belting and Asbestos — and chaired by leading British industrialist Nigel Rudd, Signature traces is history back to a small industrial company formed in the late 19th century in Scotland. </p> <p>It made brakes for Spitfire and Hurricanes during the second world war and has streamlined over the past 15 years to concentrate on ground handling for the booming private jet industry in the US. </p> <p>Under the terms of the arrangement with Blackstone, Cascade has committed not to work with any other company on any competing offers, leaving it “difficult, although not impossible” for the other suitors to prevail, a person familiar with the agreement said.</p> <p>Signature has no listed direct rival, and given its focus on the US market, analysts at Barclays said they have received questions from investors over the past few years over whether the company would be better listed on Wall Street or taken private.</p> <p>Signature's first-half underlying operating profit fell 60 per cent to $63.1m, but in a trading update in November the company said flight activity had stabilised to about 80 per cent of the previous year's levels, in a sign of the robust demand for private flying. </p> <p>Under British takeover rules, the clock is now ticking for all interested parties. GIP, Blackstone and Cascade have until January 14 to announce a firm intention to bid, or walk away, although this deadline can be extended, while Carlyle has until February 4.</p> <p>Signature shares fell 2 per to £4.07 on Friday, largely holding on to gains of more than 60 per cent since mid-December. </p><p>Source: Philip Georgiadis 2021 'Blackstone eyes £3bn Signature bid with Bill Gates's asset manager ' FT.com 8 January.
