  "text": "<p>The latest move by the Biden administration follows an increasingly clear pattern in recent months, where the federal government is involving itself directly in the cybersecurity affairs of critical infrastructure operators.</p><p>Security chiefs who have perhaps become used to a hands-off approach from regulators in the past are now finding themselves under the microscope, as the U.S. pivots to recognizing cybercrime as a national security threat.</p><p>Also today: Chinese hackers breach defense companies; Justice Department alleges insider enabled Ubiquiti breach; and privacy law changes prompt companies to switch data-collection tactics.</p><p>5 Steps for Improving Collaboration Between IT and Security</p><p>The need to defend and protect vital assets and network systems grows more urgent each day. Learning these tried-and-true techniques will ensure better communication, cooperation and security results.</p><p>Get Started</p><p>Railway Rules</p><p>Nearly all U.S. freight and passenger rail systems will be required to report certain cybersecurity incidents to the Department of Homeland Security within 24 hours of discovery under new directives published Thursday by the Biden administration.</p><p>The orders, issued under congressional authority given to the Transportation Security Administration, will affect about 90% of passenger rail systems in the U.S. and 80% of freight rail systems that are considered \"higher risk,\" a senior Department of Homeland Security official said, meaning they are considered vital to economic and national security.</p><p>The move is the newest effort by the Biden administration to require private industries, especially those involved with managing critical infrastructure like transit systems, to improve their cybersecurity practices in the face of proliferating threats, such as crippling ransomware attacks.</p><p>\"These new cybersecurity requirements and recommendations will help keep the traveling public safe and protect our critical infrastructure from evolving threats,\" DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said. \"DHS will continue working with our partners across every level of government and in the private sector to increase the resilience of our critical infrastructure nationwide.\"</p><p>Read the full story.</p><p>More Cyber News</p><p>Suspected Chinese hackers breached four U.S. defense and tech companies in the last month. Hundreds more American organizations are running a similar type of vulnerable software to the kind hackers exploited. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks Inc. last month confirmed one U.S. organization that was victim of the espionage campaign, and now says there are at least five American organizations that were affected and 13 globally in sectors including defense, healthcare, transportation and energy. Palo Alto Networks said the hackers' techniques are similar to those used by a group that Microsoft Corp. previously said operates out of China. (CNN)</p><p>Ubiquiti hack may have been attack by employee. An indictment from the Justice Department alleges that Nickolas Sharp used employee credentials to download confidential data and send anonymous ransom demands to the company he worked for. The indictment doesn't name wireless technology company Ubiquiti Inc., but name details of the attack and an unspecified company line up with Ubiquiti's data breach, Verge reports. Ubiquiti disclosed a data breach in January.</p><p>The Justice Department alleges that investigators tracked down Mr. Sharp because although he used a virtual private network, his real IP address was briefly exposed when his home internet went down. The FBI then got a search warrant and seized electronic devices from Mr. Sharp's home. (The Verge)</p><p>CISA names advisory group. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has named 23 people to its new Cybersecurity Advisory Committee. The appointees include technology executives, local government officials, journalists and academics. (Federal News Network)</p><p>24 hours</p><p>The amount of time nearly all rail operators will have to report cyberattacks under new rules published Thursday by the Biden administration.</p><p>Privacy Newsâ€Ž</p><p>Companies take steps to collect customer data after tech giants' privacy changes. Apple Inc.'s change this year restricting how users can be tracked, and Google's plans for a similar change on its Chrome browser have sent companies looking for new strategies to collect personal data. Advertisers have until now relied on tech giants and adtech firms to target their ads to consumers, but this year's changes make that more difficult. Companies in different industries are looking for tactics to directly collect data from customers through newsletters, quizzes, polls, QR codes and loyalty programs.</p><p>The nonprofit marketing group Avocados From Mexico, for example, is encouraging people to submit grocery receipts to receive avocado-themed sportswear. It has so far collected 50 million device IDs, numbers associated with mobile devices, and is working to link them with email addresses and mobile phone numbers. The nonprofit plans to use that data to target consumers with ads. (WSJ)</p>",
