  "text": "<p>   Mr. Bezos was irked by criticism of Amazon in Washington and by the media, and he pushed his team to be more assertive, said the people at Amazon. For more than a year, Amazon executives had been saying the company had to \"punch back\" at criticism from Washington, said people involved in the discussions. The executives group-edited the tweets together before sending them off, the people said. </p><p>   The Amazon spokeswoman said the company had a responsibility to push back on inaccuracies. </p><p>   Amazon's Washington team was angered by the tweets, which they viewed as a fumble that made their jobs harder, some current and former public-policy employees said. </p><p>   Mr. Carney, meanwhile, hasn't appeared to hold much sway at the White House. Since Mr. Biden's inauguration, he has visited the White House only once, according to White House visitor logs. By comparison, Brad Smith, Microsoft Corp.'s president and leader on government relations, has held four meetings there in the period, the log shows. The Amazon spokeswoman said Mr. Carney was recently at the White House once more -- the visit isn't yet reflected in the logs. </p><p>   Last year, Mr. Carney directed a frustrated message at Mr. Klain, the White House chief of staff, after Mr. Biden hosted the CEOs of Walmart Inc., Gap Inc., Lowe's Cos. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., said people familiar with the exchange. Amazon wasn't invited, and Mr. Carney pleaded for Amazon to be considered for future events, the people said. </p><p>   Last year, Mr. Biden nominated Lina Khan to head the FTC. Amazon took it as a slap in the face: The 33-year-old former Columbia Law School professor had gained fame in legal circles years earlier with a law journal article arguing for new, tighter antitrust regulation of Amazon. Amazon filed a request with the FTC seeking to have Ms. Khan, who was confirmed, recused from antitrust investigations. The FTC hasn't publicly responded to that request and declined to comment for this article. Facebook also requested a recusal, which the FTC has rejected. </p><p>   Following the Journal report on its private-label team, Amazon opened an internal investigation. Because of intense regulatory scrutiny, it decided to use an external law firm for the investigation, said people familiar with the decision. Amazon had previously conducted audits of this business line in-house, but this time hired law firm K&amp;L Gates LLP, they said. </p><p>   Amazon did so to ensure that the report and its results were \"legally privileged,\" meaning that outside agencies couldn't obtain it, said the people involved in the decision. \"A big issue internally was whether the company could be forced to hand over the investigation,\" one of the people said. Amazon was also concerned about regulators knowing who to interview on its private-label team, so making this privileged would prevent Congress and others from interviewing their employees, the people said. </p><p>   Amazon has become more careful about safeguarding its communications, said people familiar with the matter. In 2019, they said, the company's most senior executives began discussing sensitive business matters over the Signal encrypted-messaging program instead of email. The Amazon spokeswoman said secure messaging is essential so that messages from leadership aren't intercepted by bad actors. </p><p>   For months, congressional aides asked Amazon to share the K&amp;L Gates investigation's results and other audits. In October 2020, Amazon issued a short letter to the committee saying its probe concluded that its private-label team didn't misuse third-party seller data. A year later, Congress sent a letter to Amazon asking it to provide \"exculpatory evidence\" related to its private-label business under threat of a criminal referral to the Justice Department. </p><p>   In November and December 2021, lawyers representing Amazon met with congressional lawyers about the report and other audits. Some congressional staffers attended the meeting optimistic that Amazon would provide the internal report and prove it hadn't misled Congress, said someone familiar with their thinking. In that event, they would scrap plans to refer Amazon to the Justice Department for a criminal referral, the person said. </p><p>   In Capitol Hill meetings, Congress probed the team of lawyers from Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz and Covington Burling LLP about Amazon's private-label business. When Congress asked that Amazon provide Congress with its report, Wachtell said it was legally privileged. The Amazon spokeswoman said Amazon provided substantial findings from the report. She declined to say why Amazon wouldn't release the full report. </p><p></p>",
