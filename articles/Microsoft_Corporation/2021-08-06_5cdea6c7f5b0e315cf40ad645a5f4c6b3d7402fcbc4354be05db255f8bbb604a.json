  "text": "<p>Ecommerce group Bukalapak sealed its place as Indonesia's biggest stock market listing after raising $1.5bn, with its shares jumping 25 per cent on its Jakarta debut and setting the tone for south-east Asia's technology boom.</p> <p>Bukalapak's initial public offering was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/daee505b-9964-4609-9226-7861fd473e19\">closely watched</a> by investors as the first of a wave of tech start-ups from the region that are set to go public. Others include Indonesia's GoTo, formed by an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce944c28-a6d1-42b9-9da2-12e90cb2ae19\">$18bn merger</a> between ride-hailing and delivery group Gojek with ecommerce player Tokopedia, and its Singapore-headquartered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77fb99ff-e3b1-4563-b657-3a4ed55a74c4\">rival Grab</a>.</p> <p>Shares in Bukalapak surged on the Indonesia Stock Exchange to value the lossmaking group at $7.6bn, making it one of the 15 biggest companies in the country. The rally triggered a mechanism on the bourse that caps a company's daily stock price gain. </p> <p>“This is great for Indonesia's tech ecosystem,” said one rival Indonesian start-up that is also contemplating a public listing this year. Bukalapak was previously expected to raise just $300m but beefed up its IPO on bumper demand. </p> <p>South-east Asia's fast-growing tech companies have received huge influxes of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bcc935fd-ef40-4d6d-9939-ea18498e0283\">foreign venture capital</a>. US tech group Microsoft, Singaporean sovereign fund GIC and Jack Ma's Ant Group are among the previous investors in Bukalapak.</p> <p>But the regional tech groups' sources of funding <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4118e09-1c73-4ef0-9d1c-09a3d4875048\">are evolving</a>. Special purpose acquisition companies, or blank-cheque vehicles, are playing a bigger role while bourses are changing regulations to make it easier for start-ups to list. Indonesia's exchange is working on an amendment to listing rules that would relax restrictions on lossmaking companies. </p> <p>Private equity investors have previously held back from the region owing to a lack of exit options via IPOs and acquisitions, said Andrea Campagnoli, a partner at Bain &amp; Co. </p> <p>“Many investors were waiting for this moment. Now that flywheel is starting to work, it is going to be a tremendous tailwind for south-east Asia's internet economy,” he said. The fact that Bukalapak listed in Indonesia, rather than the US as with many of its peers, was important for investor confidence, Campagnoli added.</p> <p>Bukalapak posted revenues of $95.8m in 2020 according to its prospectus and had 104.9m registered users in Indonesia. Last year, it cut its net losses more than 50 per cent to $89.5m.</p> <p>The company, whose name means “open a stall”, helps millions of mom-and-pop stores across Indonesia sell goods online. Its other services include financial products. </p> <p>The company is one of Indonesia's earliest online shopping players but it has fallen behind some rivals in recent years. Bukalapak was Indonesia's third most-visited ecommerce website in the first quarter of the year, according to iPrice data, behind Tokopedia and regional giant <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5482f437-80aa-4e53-8402-dd2c911ab004\">Shopee</a>. </p> <p>Grab, one of Bukalapak's partners, announced a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73d8b26c-3d61-48ec-8027-25c4cd625488\">record Spac merger</a> in April valuing the company at $40bn and paving the way for a New York listing in the final quarter. GoTo is targeting a dual listing in Indonesia and the US this year. </p><p>Source: Mercedes Ruehl in Singapore 2021 'Ecommerce group Bukalapak's shares jump 25% in Indonesia's biggest IPO' FT.com 6 August.
