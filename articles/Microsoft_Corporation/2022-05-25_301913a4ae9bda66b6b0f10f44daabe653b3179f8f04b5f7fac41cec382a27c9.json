  "text": "<p>While most investors in our sector are nursing significant losses after the recent change in sentiment towards tech and crypto, there are still some winners and bargain hunters out there.</p> <p>Anyone taking a long-term view is able to invest in some potentially undervalued companies right now, and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is showing its faith in digital assets with the launch of a $4.5bn cryptocurrency fund, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47b05080-67ac-4468-b530-76325d6aba35\">reports Hannah Murphy</a>.</p> <p>It said on Wednesday that the largest crypto fund to date would allocate about $1.5bn to seed investments while the remaining $3bn would be earmarked for venture investments. The new fund is the fourth from Andreessen to focus on crypto, taking its total investment in the space to more than $7.6bn.</p> <p>Despite the so-called “crypto winter”, Chris Dixon, managing partner and founder of Andreessen's crypto arm, said the group believed the space was reaching a new “golden era” in which “new talent, viable infrastructure, and community knowledge” would spur rapid innovation. “We believe blockchains will power the next major computing cycle,” he said. “That's why we've decided to go big.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4667f0d-4dab-4f5b-a906-9afc332bb1d8\">Lex has been looking at</a> Korean crypto exchanges and says such exchanges, which make fees on massive crypto trading volumes regardless of the direction of the market, can end up being the winners when tokens like the stablecoin terraUSD collapse.</p> <p>Elsewhere, short sellers are reaping a bumper harvest in the tech sector sell-off, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e980265-8122-4c72-98b1-6fc68588c076\">it adds</a>. S3 Partners, a technology and data analytics firm, estimates that $1 in every $5 shorted in US markets in the last quarter was in information technology stocks. In the year to date, short positions in the IT sector have generated a 34 per cent profit, S3 calculates. Short sellers took an implied gain of $535mn on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1041fb0a-2688-4809-a3a1-b721b48a9040\">Tuesday's slump</a> in Snap shares.</p> <p>Finally, quants, the hedge funds that rely on tech — using powerful computers to run their portfolios — are making huge profits in this year's market turmoil. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e28fb42-de8a-40d7-8716-88cb5febe006\">Laurence Fletcher reports </a>the trend-following quantitative funds, which use mathematical models to try to predict market movements, have profited mainly from bets against government bonds, which have been shaken by expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates aggressively to fight high inflation.</p> <p>“Now is one of those 2008 moments where everyone [in trend-following] is doing well again. The trends are clearer,” said Leda Braga, founder of Systematica Investments and former head of systematic trading at BlueCrest.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1.
