  "text": "<p>Microsoft agreed to buy the videogame developer for $95 a share in an effort to expand its catalog of blockbuster videogames and drive more customers to its cloud-gaming service.</p><p>Microsoft valued the deal at nearly $69 billion after adjusting for Activision's net cash. The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies and would make Microsoft the world's third-largest game company by sales.</p><p>For the quarter ended March 31, Activision posted a profit of $395 million, down from $619 million in the year-earlier quarter.</p><p>In addition to tepid demand for its \"Call of Duty\" game titles, Activision said it took a hit due to the product cycle timing for its \"Warcraft\" franchise, along with increased legal fees and other costs associated with the Microsoft acquisition.</p><p>Excluding one-time items, adjusted earnings for the quarter fell to 64 cents a share, down from 98 cents in 2021.</p><p>Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting earnings of 71 cents a share.</p><p>Sales were $1.77 billion in the quarter, short of analysts' expectations of $1.82 billion.</p><p>The acquisition is slated to close in mid-2023.</p><p>Microsoft announced plans to acquire Activision as the company was being roiled by claims of workplace misconduct.</p><p>Activision's chief executive, Bobby Kotick, had known about various sexual-misconduct accusations for years, The Wall Street Journal previously reported, though he didn't inform the board about everything he knew. The issues prompted lawsuits and federal investigations.</p><p>Mr. Kotick has said he has been transparent with the company's board, and Activision has called the Journal's reporting \"misleading.\"</p><p>Last week, the company said it plans to add two women to its board of directors.</p>",
