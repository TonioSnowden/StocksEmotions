  "text": "<p>Matthew Bronfman, co-founder of the company with entrepreneur Shai Cohen, said the Capsoil marks his first major investment with direct exposure to the cannabis space.</p><p>In a phone call with MarketWatch, Bronfman said, rather than cannabis, his investment in Capsoil is about the many applications of the company's patented process for making nanometric powders designed to outperform existing methods in consistency, taste, efficacy and water solubility.</p><p>Capsoil is building up a presence in food and beverage, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, and agriculture. \"It's more broad than just cannabis,\" Bronfman said. \"Capsoil has five separate verticals.\"</p><p>First up, though, is Capsoil's It's All About Choices, its first consumer line, which is launching this week at the Hall of Flowers premium cannabis trade show in Santa Rosa, Calif.</p><p>It's All About Choices will be available in five 100mg THC bundle options with a suggested retail price of $50. The bundles include a variety of single-serve offerings in 2 mg, 5mg and 10mg sizes.</p><p>The product line is from Powder Nation, a unit of Capsoil and the exclusive license owner of Capsoil's technology in the cannabis sector.</p><p>Powder Nation seeks to make buying cannabis, \"more like a visit to a 7-11 where you can pick and choose your favorite snacks,\" said its chief operating officer, Hadas Cohen.</p><p>Bronfman, the son of Canadian billionaire Edgar Bronfman Sr. of Seagram's fame, has been an active entrepreneur and investor in his own right, particularly in Israel, where he is the main shareholder in IKEA Israel, Israel Discount Bank and the Shufersal supermarket chain. He is the brother of Edgar Bronfman Jr., a media executive who was CEO of Warner Music Group Inc. WMG from 2004 to 2011.</p><p>Along with Matthew Bronfman and Shai Cohen, Capsoil's chief technology officer, Rafael Ezra, is a founder of the company. Ezra is a founding member and chief technology officer of Canna Powder as well as CEO of Lipicare Life Sciences, according to a LinkedIn profile.</p><p>\"This technology allows for creating an infinite number of product lines with very little cannabis flavor and very fast absorption in a pharmaceutical-grade edible,\" Ezra said.</p><p>Capsoil remains privately held and is not looking for investors currently.</p><p>While many institutional investors and venture-capital firms avoid cannabis investments because the plant remains illegal under U.S. federal law, wealthy individuals and family offices continue putting private money into the sector.</p><p>Market Pulse (June 2022): Analyst estimates U.S. illicit cannabis market valued at about $100 billion, but may give way to legal sales</p><p>Bronfman-backed Capsoil brings nano powder tech to cannabis with first edibles line</p>",
