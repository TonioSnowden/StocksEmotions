It also gave IVC <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03d1edcb-041a-4d11-acfd-9830ec1e0464\">a “stratospheric” €12.3bn valuation</a>.</p> <p>When you look behind the dealmaking and the huge valuation that surround the company, which is Europe's largest vetcare provider, there lies a complex story. DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Judith Evans dug deep in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a825fe8-8ea5-4ef3-84b7-2529bfe5ffed\">this Big Read</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>IVC is what is often referred to as a private equity roll-up: it's been buying up vet clinics and merging them into a giant group, in a debt-fuelled acquisition spree.&#xa0;</p> <p>It believes its greater scale can bring better management, and introduce new technology and training that will help with both administration and animal care.</p> <p>While IVC says its UK market share is under 20 per cent, it has a big presence in some areas.&#xa0;</p> <p>As of last year, it ran 17 of the 32 vet practices in Birmingham, five of seven in Torfaen, South Wales, and four of five in Lancashire's Ribble Valley, according to an analysis by the consultancy <strong>Aldwych Partners</strong>.</p> <p>To the outside world, that transformation has been largely invisible. The company, which owns 1,500 practices, doesn't tend to rebrand them, and some continue to champion their longstanding local links.</p> <p>People don't want their local vet to feel like a “corporate machine”, one adviser close to the company said.&#xa0;</p> <p>Meanwhile, drug prices have risen.&#xa0;</p> <p>IVC doesn't force prices on to practices, but does recommend them centrally and set financial targets for clinics — and the attempt to meet these targets can lead to increases.&#xa0;</p> <p>Prices rose as much as 78 per cent for a heart medication, according to one vet in southern England, although IVC says the average rises were far lower.</p> <p>Then there is leverage: £2bn in net debt and leases, against £322m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.&#xa0;</p> <p>And there are other hallmarks of private equity ownership such as projections of rapid growth and of expanding recurring revenue from subscriptions.&#xa0;</p> <p>Not everyone is convinced. In Ireland, the lawmaker <strong>Jackie Cahill </strong>wants to ban corporates from owning practices.&#xa0;</p> <h2>A Hollywood mogul's second shot at IPO fame</h2> <p><strong>Conor McGregor</strong>, a two-division champion in <strong>Ultimate Fighting Championship</strong>, has been enshrined as the “Notorious” mixed martial artist, and one of the world's top-paid athletes.</p> <p>But the Irishman has endured setbacks, particularly his boxing loss to <strong>Floyd “Money” Mayweather</strong> in their 2017 super fight. He's reportedly rearing for a <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/boxing/13819984/conor-mcgregor-floyd-mayweather-revenge-rematch/\">$1bn rematch</a>.</p> <p>Such is the pervasiveness of another hard-charging character — <strong>Ari Emanuel</strong>, the Hollywood mogul who cuts McGregor's checks, and is angling for his own second shot at glory.&#xa0;</p> <p>Emanuel's <strong>Endeavor Group</strong> is at work on its second go at an IPO. The company's portfolio includes UFC, the <strong>Miss Universe Pageant</strong> and Tinseltown's biggest talent agency.</p> <p>The company has taken some hits, namely a 24 per cent annual revenue drop and $625m in losses last year as the pandemic halted the fighting franchise it bought with <strong>Silver Lake</strong> and <strong>KKR</strong> in 2016.&#xa0;</p> <p>After a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aadd57c8-e081-11e9-9743-db5a370481bc\">shelved first attempt</a> due to limited investor interest, it's little surprise that Emanuel, who inspired the relentless, smack-talking agent Ari Gold on HBO's <em>Entourage</em>, is back in the ring.</p> <p>“Agents are like cockroaches. We're going to survive nuclear war,” he once said, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/04/26/ari-emanuel-takes-on-the-world\">according to</a> The New Yorker.</p> <p>A successful listing could also enshrine some lucrative payouts to the company's early backers as well as its top brass. Endeavor's filing with the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> shows it has signed a tax receivable agreement with Silver Lake, KKR and a group of Endeavor executives, which could entitle them to payouts of $2.3bn over the next 15 years.</p> <p>TRAs are one way founders and buyout groups squeeze extra cash out of a business.&#xa0;</p> <p>Here's how it works: when early investors sell or exchange their equity in the company a tax benefit is created for the business. As part of the deal, the company agrees to share 85 per cent of those tax savings with its early investors, keeping the remainder for itself.</p> <p>The IPO is Endeavor's last attempt (an investor roadshow kicked off just this week).&#xa0;</p> <p>It's good news for some of Endeavor's biggest investors, including Silver Lake, which bought a majority stake in the business in 2013, and its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb4f8b5a-07c9-4880-a220-f4f5c56d4735\">co-chief executive</a>, <strong>Egon Durban</strong>, who himself is a major shareholder and has chaired Endeavor since 2014.</p> <p>KKR, <strong>The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</strong>, <strong>Jasmine Ventures</strong> (a fund controlled by the Singapore sovereign wealth fund <strong>GIC</strong>) and<strong> Coatue Management</strong> — the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc0f6c6e-b56d-42f3-93f3-b4728cdcd9dd\">secretive hedge fund</a> run by billionaire and “tiger cub” <strong>Philippe Laffont</strong> — are also listed in the filing as principal stockholders.</p> <p>Endeavor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/68da44a6-d881-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17\">hoped</a> to raise $712m from its aborted 2019 IPO. This time around the company hopes to raise as much as $1.8bn — $1.3bn from private investors including Abu Dhabi's <strong>Mubadala </strong>and <strong>New England Patriots</strong> owner <strong>Robert Kraft </strong>that it has already agreed, and the remaining $500m from new investors in its float.</p> <h2>HSBC: putting it all on red</h2> <p><strong>Noel Quinn</strong>, the chief executive of <strong>HSBC</strong>, isn't going to “flip-flop” his strategy to double-down on China just because there's been another spark in tensions between Beijing and the west.</p> <p>“We're not a political organisation and we don't want to be,” he told the FT's banking editor Stephen Morris in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75b73313-9bbb-499d-8e76-8954a79fad8f\">interview</a>.</p> <p>Yet the British finance multinational, which traces its origins back to Hong Kong in 1865, has been caught in the eye of the storm caused by China's controversial national security law in the former UK colony, as other western institutions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76f88fc4-a0c2-42dd-8419-5956477c4a4a\">quietly excuse themselves</a> from the crossfire.</p> <p>The bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb321081-434e-43f4-b9e7-13354afdfc5f\">revealed plans</a> earlier this year to further shrink its European and US operations to&#xa0;hire thousands more wealth advisers in mainland China, where it already manages $1.6tn of wealthy clients' assets.</p> <p>Quinn has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc4d6749-9abb-4b58-8ad6-7b81fc74d867\">criticised</a> by UK politicians for his support of the crackdown in Hong Kong, including his decision to freeze the accounts of pro-democracy activists. Labour MP <strong>Chris Bryant</strong> accused him of “aiding and abetting one of the biggest crackdowns on democracy in the world”.</p> <p>But the leader of Europe's largest bank has never appeared to be bothered by the opinions of others. Last year he delivered one of the bank's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0095f40-5203-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f\">largest shake-ups</a> in years, all with the disclaimer “interim” in his title as the bank courted former <strong>UniCredit</strong> boss <strong>Jean Pierre Mustier.</strong></p> <p>It appears a public beating is worth the rewards of expanding in China.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Shearman &amp; Sterling </strong>has hired <strong>Sanjeev Dhuna</strong> as a leveraged finance partner in its finance group, based in London. He joins from <strong>Allen &amp; Overy</strong>.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Former US congressman <strong>Will Hurd</strong> has become a managing director at <strong>Allen &amp; Company</strong>, according to his<strong> LinkedIn </strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-hurd-63528625/\">profile</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer </strong>has <a href=\"http://news.freshfields.com/en/Global/r/6099/freshfields_announces_31_new_counsel\">appointed</a> 31 new counsel.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Clifford Chance </strong>has hired <strong>Susan Burkhardt</strong> as a partner in New York.
