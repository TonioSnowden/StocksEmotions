  "text": "<p>My three-year-old daughter Carson might be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0dd4302-c69f-42b6-8a37-549ce113a885\">Waymo</a>'s biggest fan.&#xa0;Spawned from Google's self-driving project, Waymo vehicles are testing <a href=\"https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a37406639/waymo-testing-robotaxi-tech-in-san-francisco/\">so frequently in our San Francisco neighbourhood</a> that we usually see four of them on our 15-minute dog walk. Carson and I play “spot the Waymo” and sing about the laser-sensors that enable the vehicle to see. “The lidar on the Waymo goes pulse, pulse, pulse…”</p> <p>Carson likes Waymo because they look distinct, their 29 cameras, five lidar and six radar sensors jutting out on all sides of an <a href=\"https://www.jaguar.co.uk/news/waymo-partnership.html\">I-Pace model Jaguar</a>. The fact that a robot is driving, however, fails to impress her. This is just the reality she has been born into. It's no more special than on-demand Bluey episodes.</p> <p>The former CEO of Waymo, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc6e4693-ef3f-4bce-90e5-1bcdeb67c63d\">John&#xa0;Krafcik</a>, told me last year that Carson will never need a driver's licence. “She'll be able to use a Waymo in just about any place she might be,” he said. “So that's one less thing for you to worry about.”</p> <p>Thirteen years is a long way off, but already the wheels are in motion for San Francisco to be the first major city with a driverless ride-hailing service. Last summer, Waymo and GM-owned Cruise <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/gms-cruise-gets-permit-give-driverless-rides-passengers-san-francisco-2021-09-30/\">obtained permits</a> to “receive compensation for autonomous services offered to the public”. Neither group makes any meaningful revenue today, but investors value each above $30bn — double that of Lyft, which has operations in more than 600 cities across all 50 states.&#xa0;</p> <p>Investors are banking on the belief that once these vehicles prove they're safer than humans, they'll turn into cash machines on wheels. This vision has attracted the world's biggest companies, including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f68d2583-16b7-4bf0-b98e-5431781fda9f\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46ff4fe4-0ae6-4f68-902c-3fd14d294d72\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37ae69d9-f160-48c3-b3c5-736730c110ce\">Amazon</a>.</p> <p>Yet I remain sceptical. It's not so much the technology. When I arranged for Waymo to pick up my family for a 20-minute test ride, the robot made no discernible mistakes. It is assertive and smooth. And in the “truly driverless” ride-hailing service Waymo has been operating for more than two years in Phoenix, it has yet to be involved in any major incidents.&#xa0;No, the&#xa0;reason these services aren't widely available is mostly to do with the absence of a clear business model.&#xa0;</p> <p>Back in 2014, Travis Kalanick, then-CEO of Uber, said the prospect of driverless cars posed an existential challenge to Uber. Human drivers account for ­two-thirds of the cost of an Uber journey, he reasoned, so “when there is no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere is cheaper”.</p> <p>Since then, it's become clear that the economics are more complex. What made Uber so disruptive is the gig economy. The app serves nearly 100 million people each month in more than 10,000 cities, without Uber owning a single car. Its drivers are contractors, so it only pays them when they are carrying passengers. If the driver is waiting around at the airport, say, it's not Uber's problem. It has sophisticated software to match riders with drivers, and to do it quickly, but it endures few penalties for having too many drivers at once, or too few.&#xa0;</p> <p>The driverless industry throws away these advantages. Instead of hiring drivers on the cheap, Waymo needs to spend years testing in any given market. In place of the lucrative, asset-lite business model, Cruise must instead build or purchase vehicles costing some $200,000 apiece. Deploy too many cars and they are wasting capital. Too few and they'll be frustrating passengers with lengthy wait times.&#xa0;</p> <p>A driver also plays the implicit role of conductor, ensuring the car is fuelled and hindering illicit activity. Driverless cars will have to be serviced and monitored to do the same thing. “Driverless does not mean humanless,” says Ashley Nunes, a researcher at MIT. His work on the subject has concluded that robotaxis can't compete with the gig economy on price. “Robotaxis replace one set of human costs, the human driver, with another, inefficiency,” he adds.&#xa0;</p> <p>Like the industry, I'm confident the tech challenges facing robotaxis can be solved. But the business model looks flawed. Far more plausible are the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/1/8/22872749/john-deere-self-driving-tractor-autonomous-farming\">autonomous tractors</a> Deere has made to roam empty fields performing seasonal work. Autonomous trucks, too, seem likely to have a bright future.</p> <p>When robotaxis finally open to the public in San Francisco, they risk becoming a gimmick.&#xa0;Fun to try, sure, but they'll cost the same as an Uber, arrive no faster and decline to speed up when you're in a rush. A lot could change by 2035, when&#xa0;my daughter is due to reach driving age. But even so, I may yet have to join previous generations of parents in enjoying the unique terror of sliding over to the passenger seat.</p> <p><em>Patrick McGee is an FT correspondent in San Francisco</em></p><p>Source: Patrick McGee 2022 'The true flaw of driverless cars isn't the tech' FT.com 25 January.
