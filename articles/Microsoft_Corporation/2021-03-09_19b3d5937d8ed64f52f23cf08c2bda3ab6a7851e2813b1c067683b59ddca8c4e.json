  "text": "<p>“There's just something that's really magical about the sense of presence, and feeling like you're there with another person and everything that goes into that psychologically.”</p> <p>The words of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg in a<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-on-mind-reading-apple-and-the-race-to-mainstream-vr\"> podcast with The Information</a>. He could have been talking about how we're all feeling right now — starved of human company under lockdowns and social-distancing restrictions — but he was referring to the social network's efforts to create that feeling of being with another person through Virtual or Augmented Reality.</p> <p>Facebook, Apple and Microsoft feel AR and VR are so close to becoming mass-market tech they can almost touch them — the demand is there for the humanising of working-from-home video chats, the bandwidth has arrived and the products are under development.</p> <p>At its Ignite virtual conference last week, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2021/03/02/how-microsoft-virtual-augmented-reality-mesh-azure-oculus/\">Microsoft demonstrated </a>the “holoportation” abilities of its Mesh technology to “beam a lifelike image of a person into a virtual scene”. It used its HoloLens 2 headset, but Mesh's cloud system will have interoperability with other devices such as Facebook's Oculus headsets.</p> <p>On Sunday, respected Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the iPhone maker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/07/kuo-apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022/\">planned to release</a> a mixed reality headset “in mid-2022,” followed by augmented reality glasses by 2025. The first should weigh less than 200g and cost around $1,000, Kuo said.</p> <p>In his podcast interview, the Facebook chief predicts a future of zapping into people's living rooms, where “you just kind of snap your fingers and teleport, and you're sitting there and they're on their couch and it feels like you're there together . . . you'll be able to take out games or other objects and instantiate them as virtual objects and interact and get work done and play games together and all of that”. It will create a dynamic “where you can live anywhere you want and basically teleport to work anywhere else”, he says.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70754d95-8d39-4488-9e73-7561d5480884\">Tim Bradshaw interviews </a>Jeremy Bailenson, who has led Stanford University's&#xa0;<a href=\"https://vhil.stanford.edu/\">Virtual Human Interaction Lab</a>&#xa0;for almost 20 years, in this week's FT magazine. He has already seen the future through lab experiments: “The moment I really got AR was when I saw a realistic human dropped into my room in the right space and the right size,” he says. It sounds like a “Beam me up, Scotty” moment from <em>Star Trek,</em> and definitely an improvement on another “Zoom me now” video chat.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Biden adds to anti-Big Tech appointments</strong><br>After <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45c2d360-b9ac-4ea3-8452-b336306651ba\">appointing Tim Wu,</a> a prominent critic of Big Tech, as a competition policy adviser, the Biden administration is now set to nominate Lina Khan,&#xa0;a Columbia University legal scholar championed by anti-Big Tech activists, to the Federal Trade Commission, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2021/03/09/scoop-biden-taps-another-big-tech-trustbuster-492042\">reports Politico</a>. We profiled her in<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7945c568-4fe7-11e9-9c76-bf4a0ce37d49\"> a Lunch with the FT</a> two years ago.</p> <p><strong>2. Nasdaq roars back</strong><br>US stocks<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9a17db2-c202-428e-bad3-367eea055b75\"> rallied strongly</a> on Tuesday as major tech names such as Tesla and Apple roared higher after a sell-off at the start of the week. The Nasdaq Composite soared 4 per cent in afternoon trading, a day after the tech-focused benchmark slumped into correction territory.</p> <p><strong>3. First challenge to Indian internet law</strong><br>The High Court of Delhi has said it will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d404b9d2-e152-4bbc-8956-f62b952ffaa6\">hear the first legal challenge</a> to India's sweeping new internet rules that have shaken Big Tech and stoked concerns over free speech and privacy. A wave of legal challenges are expected against the expansive rules, which directly impact WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter's operations in India, along with streaming companies such as Netflix and Amazon, and digital news publishers.</p> <p><strong>4. Exchange breach becomes hacking free-for-all</strong><br>There has been a flood of attacks by multiple hacking outfits — including criminal groups — rushing to compromise victims of Microsoft Exchange email&#xa0;servers' vulnerability. The European Banking Authority this week became the first notable body to publicly say it had been compromised. It is unlikely to be the last, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74fa3de6-dd16-4dc5-9b69-38bde634adc3\">reports Hannah Murphy</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>5. BT's boardroom bust-up</strong><br>BT chief executive Philip Jansen has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5f283e6-cbf2-4ee3-adc5-b77ea243e58b\">come under pressure </a>from the company's independent board directors after he threatened to resign unless the chairman, Jan du Plessis, retired. The UK telco announced that du Plessis would depart a week ago. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/059e265d-7cf5-48b4-a2ca-05201d180fcc\">Helen Thomas comments</a> that the boardroom drama has quickly descended into farce.</p> <h2>Tech tools — Cowboy 3 electric bike</h2> <p>One of the few pleasures left in the UK under lockdown has been regular walks in the park, but my horizons have been expanded by the loan of Cowboy's latest electric bike. A bike increases your range, <a href=\"https://uk.cowboy.com/\">the Cowboy 3 </a> (£1,990) extends it further, allowing me to take on hills and distances I would not have the stamina or inclination to tackle on a normal bike. </p> <p>What I like about the Cowboy is its ability to sense gradients to give you that extra assistance that make climbs a breeze, and the simplicity of its design, in particular, the puncture-proof tyres and a “chain” that is a carbon belt drive, working without oil and good for 30,000km.</p> <p>It's also a very smart bike. Any movement while you're away from it and there's an alert on my iPhone app. It unlocks when I am close to it and, mounting my phone on the handlebars, I can see my speed and location on a map and my trips are recorded. On the negative side, I found the app was a big drain on my iPhone battery and it was easy not to connect the charging lead properly and find yourself with a flat battery before an intended ride. I also suffered a wonky pedal, but this allowed Cowboy to show off the merits of its Mobile Service, with a bike repair person sent out to me free of charge. Other features include Find My Bike through its built-in GPS and a crash detection feature that will alert your emergency contacts if you suffer a fall.</p> <p>It's not the lightest electric bike, but I liked the solidity of the construction and felt comfortable on country trails with it. I would have liked to have been able to adjust the handlebars higher, but there are third-party options to replace them with ones with a higher raked angle. Jonathan Margolis has also been trying out the Cowboy 3 and<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e65332f5-fb12-4251-8019-2b8cd7a7da0e\"> is a fan</a>. </p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'From Zoom to zapping into view' FT.com 9 March.
