  "title": "Pennsylvanians Rush to Fix Mail Ballots After Court Ruling; Some early voters forgot to date their mail-in ballots in the key Senate race",
  "text": "<p>Election officials in Philadelphia County and Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh, published online the names of about 4,000 residents whose mail-in ballots were at risk of being rejected following the Nov. 1 decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which said ballots with an incorrect or missing date on an exterior envelope shouldn't be counted.</p><p>John Fetterman, the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in the state, filed a federal lawsuit on Monday arguing that excluding the ballots was unconstitutional.</p><p>Mr. Fetterman's race against Republican opponent Mehmet Oz is considered a tossup.</p><p>Almost five million people voted early in Pennsylvania, either in-person or by submitting a mail-in ballot, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida.</p><p>Under Pennsylvania law, voters must fill out, date and sign a declaration printed on the official return envelope.</p><p>For years, judges have split on whether a ballot should be disqualified if it lacks a handwritten date on the exterior envelope, which isn't used by election officials that verify voter eligibility. Such ballots were counted in the November 2020 presidential election, but the Pennsylvania Supreme Court based that decision in part on the extraordinary circumstances created by the pandemic.</p><p>Pennsylvania's highest court on Nov. 1 ordered election officials to disqualify mail-in ballots if the exterior envelope is undated or incorrectly dated. The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by the Republican National Committee and other GOP groups.</p><p>Allegheny County reported about 1,000 ballots that will be affected by the ruling if not fixed, and Philadelphia County had more than 3,000.</p><p>In the federal lawsuit filed on Monday, Mr. Fetterman's campaign said the date requirement \"imposes unnecessary hurdles that eligible Pennsylvanians must clear to exercise their most fundamental right\" under the U.S. Constitution.</p><p>Aside from the battle over mail-in ballots, Election Day got off to a smooth start in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, with voting-rights groups reporting only isolated instances of polling places opening late or running into difficulties.</p><p>\"Overall, not too bad of a day,\" said Khalif Ali, executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, a watchdog group. \"We haven't seen anything atypical.\"</p><p>Voters encountered more issues in Arizona's Maricopa County, where tabulation machines in about 20% of the county's 223 voting centers are malfunctioning and not accepting some completed ballots as designed, county officials said Tuesday.</p><p>Bill Gates, chairman of the county board of supervisors, said about one in five ballots aren't being accepted by the malfunctioning machines. In those instances, he said, voters are being asked to deposit their completed ballot in a secure drop box on the tabulating machine. Mr. Gates said the secure drop box is a redundancy, should a tabulating machine malfunction.</p><p>\"Everyone is still getting to vote. No one is being disenfranchised,\" Mr. Gates said. \"This is a technical issue and we have a redundancy for it.\"</p><p>Ballots left in the drop box will be collected after polls close and will be taken to a central vote-counting center by a bipartisan team, Mr. Gates said.</p><p>The Justice Department said Monday it would send monitors to 64 jurisdictions in 24 states, as it routinely does during election cycles to look out for legal violations, harassment and intimidation. Officials in Missouri and Florida have rejected the monitors, calling their presence inappropriate and unnecessary.</p><p>The Justice Department said it would station federal election observers outside polling places in those states after officials said they would block them from entering the facilities.</p><p>Sadie Gurman and Alicia Caldwell contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jan Wolfe at jan.wolfe@wsj.com</p><p>Pennsylvanians Rush to Fix Mail Ballots After Court Ruling</p>",
