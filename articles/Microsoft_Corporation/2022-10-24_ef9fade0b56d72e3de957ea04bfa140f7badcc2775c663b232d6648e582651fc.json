  "title": "Can a New Museum Wake Up D.C.'s Sleepy Art Scene? Miami's Rubell Museum is known for edgy art that propels artists to new heights. Now they're aiming to shake things up in the nation's capital.",
  "text": "<p>\"The Rubells are going to electrify the local scene,\" said Caitlin Berry, a former art adviser and dealer in the D.C. area hired to be the new space's director. \"D.C. has to be ready to engage with artists' ideas about racial parity, gender equality and climate change. We can't live in the past anymore.\"</p><p>The Rubells and their hotelier son, Jason, intend to use the museum to show art that tackles politically touchy topics like racism and abortion, and they're planning to find and promote promising D.C.-area artists, which could bolster local galleries. Challenging themes do pop up at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden as well as the privately owned Glenstone in nearby Potomac, Md. But the Rubells tend to seek out and promote provocative and emerging artists, like Amoako Boafo and Natalie Ball, before anyone else.</p><p>The museum will offer free admission to District residents; adults and students visiting from elsewhere will pay $15 and $12, respectively.</p><p>The title of the inaugural exhibit, \"What's Going On,\" nods to singer Marvin Gaye, an alum of the school that is now home to the museum. His 1971 hit song inspired a series of 20 Keith Haring drawings that will be shown in the new space. At least 40 additional artists with roughly 200 works will be installed in the brick school's 32,000 square feet, spanning two dozen classrooms and teachers' offices now converted into galleries.</p><p>The airy auditorium, with its row of arched windows, will feature a quartet of wall-spanning works by major artists. That includes Kehinde Wiley, who is known for painting former President Barack Obama's official portrait, and Ghanaian artist El Anatsui, who turns bottle caps and street debris into breathtaking tapestries.</p><p>Christopher Myers's \"Earth\" will be featured with a huge quilt-like tapestry memorializing the people in New York who died of Covid-19 and were buried on Hart Island.</p><p>The Rubells said they've been paying attention to the D.C. art scene for decades but particularly since they bought the Capitol Skyline Hotel located a block east from their new museum in 2002. They said it has been closed since the start of the pandemic, when the couple offered to allow the District to use it to house the homeless.</p><p>Mera Rubell said they hope to use the museum in part to showcase artists with local ties including D.C.-born February James, a former makeup artist known for her wryly distorted portraits.</p><p>Another recent discovery is Sylvia Snowden, an 80-year-old artist who lives a few miles from the museum. Ms. Snowden has spent the past six decades amassing a brownstone's worth of thickly painted portraits of her children. A Howard University graduate, she creates figures that roil into uneasy abstraction.</p><p>Ms. Snowden has had a couple of milestone shows in her life. A 2000 Corcoran Gallery of Art exhibit centered on portraits of her son Malik, who was shot to death in the city at the age of 18 in 1993.</p><p>When the Rubells visited her in the past year, they found stacks of portraits Ms. Snowden had painted of her daughter, Shell Snowden Butler. \"When you see these paintings, you could cry,\" Ms. Rubell said. \"You see these women, huddling, and there's so much love in them. They're really moving.\"</p><p>Five of Ms. Snowden's \"Shell, Glimpses\" series will now get their own room at the new museum.</p><p>The artist said she is glad that a handful of the pieces in her much-larger series highlighting her daughter's \"strength and femininity\" will get seen by the public. \"It's like a book,\" she said of working in a series. \"Every painting is a chapter.\"</p><p>Tough themes continue throughout the rooms, from the legacies of slavery and genocide of indigenous populations to women's reproductive rights. In one classroom, Noah Davis's \"The Seven Prisoners of the Abyss\" depicts a spare scene of forlorn-looking silhouettes. In the narrow teacher's office beyond hang Carrie Mae Weems's repurposed slave-era photographs.</p><p>Don Rubell said the museum may court a little controversy. Its debut show includes the paintings of Juanita McNeely, whose 1968 \"Woman's Psyche\" series nods to the artist's health woes involving cancer, referencing menstruation.</p><p>But there are also lighter-hearted pieces, including John Miller's 2007 \"A Refusal to Accept Limits,\" an installation in the museum's basement that features faux world monuments whose columns are covered in gold leaf. The piece explores mankind's need to memorialize itself, a fitting sentiment in a city brimming with monuments, the Rubells said.</p><p>\"Artists are courageous soothsayers in presenting contemporary points of view, and we want to be part of that dialogue,\" said Jason Rubell. In D.C., he added, \"You're already in the belly of so many conversations that artists want to have, and this can be a place to talk about it.\"</p><p>Write to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.com</p><p>More in Art &amp; Auctions</p><p>* Tech Titans Are Backing a Museum with a Taco Party, Not a Gala</p><p>* $70 Million in Art at MoMA to Be Sold to Extend Museum's Digital Reach</p><p>* Seoul—Not Hong Kong—Is the Newest Art Capital of the World</p><p>* Paul Allen's $1 Billion Art Collection Heads to Auction</p><p>* Ken Griffin on Why He Spent $43 Million to Buy the U.S. Constitution</p><p>Can a New Museum Wake Up D.C.'s Sleepy Art Scene?</p>",
