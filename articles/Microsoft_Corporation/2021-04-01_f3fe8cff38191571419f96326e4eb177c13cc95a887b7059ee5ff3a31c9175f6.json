Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/07/apple-vr-ar-headset-in-2022/\">predicted last month</a> that it would release a “helmet type” headset with AR and VR capabilities next year, costing around $1,000.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Niantic Labs</strong> of Pokémon Go!

Its “Integrated Visual Augmentation System” headsets will help soldiers train, home in on targets or be aware of nearby threats by overlaying contextual information on top of the real world, according to <a href=\"https://www.peosoldier.army.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2556870/ivas-production-contract-award/\">Wednesday's announcement</a>.</p> <p><em><strong>** #techFT is taking an Easter break and will return on Tuesday **</strong></em></p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1.
