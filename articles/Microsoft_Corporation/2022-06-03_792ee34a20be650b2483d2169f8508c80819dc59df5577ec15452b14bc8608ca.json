  "title": "Business News:  Microsoft Says It Will Work With Unions  ---  Software company  lays out guidelines it  would use for dealing  with labor groups  ----  By Aaron Tilley",
  "text": "<p>   Microsoft Corp. said it is open to working with any labor unions that want to organize within its workforce, staking out a new position as some of its biggest tech rivals grapple with a surge in unionization drives. </p><p>   Microsoft President Brad Smith, in a blog post Thursday, laid out a set of commitments that the Redmond, Wash., software company said it would use for dealing with unions. Among other pledges, Microsoft said it would not discourage employees from using their legal right to form and join unions and also would not try to complicate the pricess of unionization for its employees. </p><p>   \"Recent unionization campaigns across the country -- including in the tech sector have led us to conclude that inevitably these issues will touch on more businesses, potentially including our own,\" Mr. Smith wrote. </p><p>   Thursday's post was Mr. Smith's latest attempt to publicly carve out a position for Microsoft on a sensitive subject that is distinct from other tech giants. He has made similar moves on other issues, such as speaking out against Apple Inc.'s closed app store policies and backing efforts to get Facebook and Google to pay for news. Executives at other tech companies have privately and sometimes publicly fumed about Microsoft's positioning on these issues. </p><p>   U.S. tech giants have long avoided unions. Microsoft reported a global workforce of around 181,000 as of June of last year. None are currently unionized in the U.S. But a wave of unionization efforts across the U.S. in recent years has hit some tech giants, particularly Amazon.com Inc. and Apple, which have large hourly-worker employee bases at warehouses and stores. </p><p>   Mr. Smith's statement comes as Microsoft is working to close its planned acquisition of videogaming company Activision Blizzard Inc., which has been facing a unionization push. Last month, a small number of employees at an Activision studio voted in favor of unionizing with the Communications Workers of America. The $75 billion deal to acquire Activision is Microsoft's largest deal ever. </p><p>   Following Activision employees' union vote, Microsoft said it wouldn't stand in the way if Activision recognizes a union. \"Microsoft respects Activision Blizzard employees' right to choose whether to be represented by a labor organization and we will honor those decisions,\" a Microsoft spokesman said at the time. </p><p>   In making the commitment on Thursday to working closely with unions, Microsoft may be trying to differentiate itself from other tech giants. </p><p>   Amazon has been contesting unionization attempts at several of its warehouses for more than a year. Workers at one of its Staten Island facilities, which employs thousands of people who help prepare and ship Amazon packages, voted earlier this year to unionize. Others at an Alabama warehouse voted against unionization last year, and during a revote in March, the contest was too close to call. In meetings with workers, the company pointed to its pay and benefits and asserted that unionization was unnecessary. </p><p>   Workers at several Apple retail locations declared their intent to vote on unionization, including in New York, Georgia and Maryland. A group of workers in Georgia recently withdrew an election petition that was set to begin Thursday, according to the National Labor Relations Board. Apple recently boosted pay for hourly workers in the U.S. to $22 an hour, or higher depending on the market, a 45% increase from 2018. </p><p>   Apple and Amazon didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>   \"We recognize that the right approach for Microsoft may be different from what will work best for others,\" Mr. Smith wrote in his blog post about working with unions. </p><p></p>",
