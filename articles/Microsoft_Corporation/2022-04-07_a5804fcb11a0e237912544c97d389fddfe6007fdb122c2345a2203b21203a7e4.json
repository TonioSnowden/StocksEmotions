  "title": "Gadget-Rental Startup Grover Raises $330 Million to Expand in U.S. Smartphones and other devices rented through the German company's platform typically change hands four or five times, getting more use out of products before they are thrown away",
  "text": "<p>Founded in 2015, Grover runs an e-commerce platform that people can use to rent more than 3,000 products, including Apple Inc. iPhones and Apple Watches and Microsoft Corp. Xbox videogame consoles. After the rental period, users send the devices back to be refurbished and leased again.</p><p>Grover's rentals typically change hands four or five times. The company operates in Germany, Austria, Spain, Netherlands and the U.S., renting devices mainly to individuals, though it also has a business-to-business segment.</p><p>The company offers only products that are durable and can be repaired, avoiding low-cost devices that deteriorate quickly, said Michael Cassau, its founder and chief executive. Grover said its model can prolong the life of consumer electronics.</p><p>E-waste is among the fastest-growing waste streams in the world, increasing by around 3% a year, and most of it isn't recycled, according to the United Nations.</p><p>Grover remains a tiny player in the electronics business, in which 29 million new smartphones were shipped last year in the U.S. alone, according to International Data Corp. The gadget-rental company has more than 250,000 active subscribers and 500,000 subscriptions, with people often renting more than one product, Mr. Cassau said. The company is growing fast. Mr. Cassau said active users and subscriptions are roughly doubling every year.</p><p>\"For many businesses or for most, sustainability comes at a cost. For us, it comes at a profit,\" Mr. Cassau said. \"The more frequently we can recirculate a product, the better it is for our bottom line.\"</p><p>Grover, which doesn't disclose its financial results, isn't profitable in all its markets because it is spending heavily to grow, although its German business has been profitable since 2020, Mr. Cassau said.</p><p>The fundraising round will help fund Grover's expansion in the U.S., which has become its fastest-growing market since it launched a headquarters in Miami last year, Mr. Cassau said. He said Grover would use the money raised to hire more than 100 people in the U.S., mostly software engineers and product professionals, and to advertise its service.</p><p>One growth area for Grover is its business-to-business rental service, through which customers such as technology startups can rent devices including laptops and smartphones. Mr. Cassau said the business-to-business service accounts for 15% of Grover's subscriptions and it wants to increase that figure to 40%.</p><p>Grover has flexible rental periods and costs varyâ€”renting a product might cost 20% of its purchase price for a three-month period or 50% for 12 months. Mr. Cassau said Grover attracts consumers who want to avoid taking on debt through longer financing agreements, especially if they might stop using the product while continuing to pay for it.</p><p>Often, \"people commit for three years of financing or three years of leasing for any product and they stop using it after 18 months,\" he said.</p><p>Making sure gadgets are used longer before they are discarded has climate benefits. In Europe, extending the lifespan of electronics through repairs by one year would deliver the same emissions benefits as taking 2 million cars off the road, according to the nonprofit European Environmental Bureau. European Union lawmakers are trying to crack down on e-waste and are seeking to make manufacturers ensure products can be repaired.</p><p>Still, while Grover's service might extend product lifespans, that doesn't mean they will be recycled. After products have been used and refurbished several times, they are sold. The company has hired experts to work on ways of ensuring products are recycled, but it will take years to achieve that ambition, Mr. Cassau said.</p><p>\"Our goal is to make that circular-economy experience complete,\" he said. \"To make sure that our business model is able to extract enough profitability throughout the recirculation cycles that the product can eventually go back into recycling and be made available to the [manufacturers] as a source for raw materials.\"</p><p>Write to Dieter Holger at dieter.holger@wsj.com</p><p>Gadget-Rental Startup Grover Raises $330 Million to Expand in U.S.</p>",
