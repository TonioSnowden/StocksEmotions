  "title": "Energy Impact Partners Raises $485 Million to Back Clean-Energy Technologies; Investors in the new fund include Microsoft Corp. and other large companies that help validate its investments",
  "text": "<p>\"One of the biggest challenges for any new technology startup is figuring out how to engage with large incumbents in whatever sector they are in and using that to accelerate their path to market,\" he said. \"We think we have a unique model built to enable [portfolio companies to] short-circuit some of the challenges.\"</p><p>In addition to Duke, Williams and Microsoft, which invested through its Climate Innovation Fund, other corporate backers of the new fund include real-estate investment trust AvalonBay Communities Inc., infrastructure engineering company Burns &amp; McDonnell and utility companies Southern Co. and TC Energy Corp., according to Mr. Kann.</p><p>Energy Impact Partners so far has committed nearly half of the new fund across 12 deals, Mr. Kann said. The firm has backed developers of clean-energy technologies such as Form Energy Inc., which is focused on iron-air batteries. The firm has also invested in nuclear fusion developer Zap Energy Inc. and carbon-capture company Carbon America.</p><p>Mr. Kann cited Form Energy as an example of how fund backers helped validate the company's iron-air batteries as a cheaper and longer-lasting energy storage technology compared with the more common lithium-ion devices. The Somerville, Mass.-based startup said earlier this year that it's working with Southern subsidiary Georgia Power to use its batteries in new energy-storage projects.</p><p>\"We were able to get early customer validation at a fundamentally deep level from a bunch of our [investors] who are Form's future customers,\" Mr. Kann said. \"[That] gave us a lot more confidence and conviction in the company.\"</p><p>He added that Energy Impact Partners' collaboration with large users of clean-energy technologies helped it attract investors to other funds it manages.</p><p>In September, Energy Impact Partners said it had secured the backing of large institutional investors, such as the Mideast sovereign-wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Dutch pension asset manager APG Asset Management NV, for its first Europe-focused fund. The firm aims to collect €390 million, equivalent to $402.8 million, for that fund.</p><p>Last year, the sustainability-focused firm wrapped up its second flagship fund with more than $1 billion in commitments. Founded in 2015, Energy Impact Partners now manages roughly $3 billion. The firm says it has built a network of more than 50 corporate investors interested in backing decarbonization bets that also helps it identify potential investments.</p><p>The firm puts a greater emphasis on decarbonization technologies with its new Frontier fund compared with its other vehicles, Mr. Kann said. The early-stage technologies in development at portfolio companies have proved to work in the lab but haven't yet reached commercial readiness.</p><p>For example, Seattle-based Zap Energy is seeking to develop nuclear fusion as an energy source and as an alternative to the waste-intensive fission process used in atomic energy plants today.</p><p>\"There's no fundamental science risk—the science works,\" Mr. Kann said of technologies the firm backs, including Zap's fusion project. He added, however, that there is still \"substantial risk\" in scaling up some of those technologies.</p><p>Mr. Kann said the firm believes that each technology under development by companies the new fund backs has a role to play in the shift to clean energy.</p><p>\"There is no panacea to solving climate change,\" he said. \"It is going to be an array of different technologies that serve different needs and different markets, and our intent is to find the most promising technologies across each of those markets.\"</p><p>Write to Luis Garcia at luis.garcia@wsj.com</p>",
