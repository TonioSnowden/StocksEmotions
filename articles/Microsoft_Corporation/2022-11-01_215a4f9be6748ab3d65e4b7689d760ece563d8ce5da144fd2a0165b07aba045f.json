  "text": "<p>Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi told analysts he was \"confident in our ability to deliver healthy top and bottom line growth\" despite \"the uncertain global economic environment.\"</p><p>Uber shares rose close to 15% after the results.</p><p>While Uber's revenue took a hit from the stronger dollar, it was bolstered by high ride prices in the U.S. and the company's acquisition of Transplace, a logistics service provider.</p><p>By standard accounting measures, Uber still posted a $1.2 billion net loss driven by the falling value of its stakes in two overseas counterparts—China's Didi Global Inc. and Southeast Asia's Grab Holdings Inc.—and self-driving startup Aurora Innovation Inc. The company posted a loss of $2.42 billion a year earlier.</p><p>Uber's gross bookings—the value of transitions made on the app—grew 26% to $29.12 billion, below the $29.63 billion predicted by analysts surveyed by FactSet.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What has your Uber usage been like this year? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Uber forecast slower bookings growth. The company said it expects bookings in the current quarter of between $30 billion and $31 billion, short of Wall Street's forecast of $32 billion. That translates to year-over-year growth of 16% to 20%, compared with the 56% it posted during the same quarter last year.</p><p>One of its closest-watched financial metrics, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, should come in between $600 million to $630 million this quarter, the company said, better than the $568 million Wall Street had been projecting. This figure strips out some expenses, such as stock-based compensation, that executives consider to be outside a company's core operations. Uber has long pointed to it to signal a path to profits.</p><p>It has been a tough quarter for many top tech companies. Shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and others have been pummeled after weaker-than-expected results. Companies that flourished during the pandemic as life and work shifted more to the internet now project slowdowns, spooking investors. Sales of personal computers and other gadgets are falling. Consumers, hit by inflation, are trimming their spending, and business customers are tightening their budgets.</p><p>Growth has cooled in recent quarters for the company's delivery arm, Uber Eats, which did brisk business during the pandemic. Third-quarter revenue was up 24% year-over-year, after nearly doubling in the year-earlier quarter. Growth in the U.S. and Canada was slower than the rest of the world.</p><p>A looming question for Uber is whether consumers, squeezed by inflation and worried about a possible economic downturn, will continue to pay a premium for food delivery and accept high ride prices.</p><p>Mr. Khosrowshahi said people's delivery bills were rising and the company is still seeing strong demand for rides even from its customers in lower-income groups.</p><p>\"At this point, we're not seeing weakness, we're definitely watching out for it,\" he said.</p><p>One upside: The company has said that the tough environment is drawing more drivers. For the first time since the pandemic struck, the company said it ended the last quarter with the number of active ride-share drivers back to 2019 levels. Uber and its ride-share rival Lyft Inc. have grappled with a yearlong driver shortage, an imbalance that has pushed ride prices to record highs.</p><p>Fares remain elevated despite better driver numbers. Nationwide prices in September for a standard Uber and Lyft were 36% higher than in September 2019, according to market-research firm YipitData.</p><p>Neither Uber nor Lyft releases pricing data, and neither has said how many more drivers are needed to meet demand.</p><p>Analysts don't expect fares to return to prepandemic levels even after the driver shortage eases. That is because Uber and Lyft are under pressure from investors to squeeze more profit out of each ride.</p><p>The companies have responded to inflation by tacking on new charges. Earlier this year, they imposed a temporary fuel surcharge on riders to make up for high gasoline prices. Last month, Lyft imposed another rider charge to offset rising insurance premiums that it pays for drivers.</p><p>Uber is also cutting costs. The company has announced a hiring freeze and said it would scale back spending on marketing.</p><p>A new Biden administration proposal could reignite a longstanding debate over how ride-drivers should be classified, and potentially boost Uber's costs if it has to change its gig-worker model.</p><p>Mr. Khosrowshahi said he was confident that even if the law changes Uber won't need to upend its labor model, pointing to states such as California and Washington, where Uber had won similar reclassification battles.</p><p>\"The trend is in our favor,\" he said, though \"the road is going to be bumpy.\"</p><p>Write to Preetika Rana at preetika.rana@wsj.com</p><p>Uber Shares Surge on Gains in Quarterly Revenue, Adjusted Profit</p>",
