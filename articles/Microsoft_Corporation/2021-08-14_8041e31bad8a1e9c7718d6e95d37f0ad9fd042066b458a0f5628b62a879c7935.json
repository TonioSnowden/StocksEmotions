  "text": "<p>\n  \"My initial reaction was like, 'I'm working so hard. How would you even say that?'\" he says. \"I guess from his perspective it looked like I wasn't doing anything.\" </p><p>\n  He eventually left his main job and took a full-time job, with benefits, at one of his other companies, negotiating an employment contract that gave him the ability to do work on the side. </p><p>\n  \"Now I feel totally free,\" he says. </p><p>\n  Workers still playing the game say they worry constantly about someone catching on. Yet they simultaneously feel their experiments in double work have finally given them a sense of control. Even if companies start calling people back to the office -- whether this fall, or further down the line -- those with two jobs say the world of remote work has gotten big enough to give them options. One woman in Atlanta, who was working for an insurance company and a telecommunications company, scoffed when one of her employers sent an email outlining a tentative return-to-work plan. Then a colleague started encroaching on her projects. </p><p>\n  She handed in her notice and quickly landed another second job. </p><p>\n  \"I now have leverage,\" she says. </p><p>\n  She recently hired a personal assistant, who sits in on calls when she is double-booked and alerts her if she is needed in a meeting. </p><p>\n  \"Am I trying to be like a five-star employee?\" she says. \"Not really. I'm just trying to do the job I need to not get fired.\" </p><p>\n  Holding two jobs isn't illegal, says Richard Greenberg, an employment attorney with Jackson Lewis PC in New York. </p><p>\n  \"It's more of a contract issue. You're jeopardizing your employment. There's very few things that rise to criminal violations,\" he says. </p><p>\n  If a worker violates a noncompete agreement by working for another firm, the employer could sue him, says Claire Deason, a Minneapolis employment attorney with Littler Mendelson PC. </p><p>\n  A company could also theoretically sue a duplicitous worker for things like disclosing confidential information or misrepresenting himself, Mr. Greenberg says. </p><p>\n  But that could mean public attention on the issue. Chances are the worker would just get fired, Mr. Greenberg says. Maybe not even that. </p><p>\n  \"Let's be honest. You have to be pretty bad at being sly to get caught,\" he says. </p><p>\n  Besides, managers sometimes see incentives to hang on to dead weight. Losing head count can amount to losing power in some organizations. No one wants to be caught short-staffed. And in the current tight labor market, workers often have the upper hand. </p><p>\n  Chris Hansen, a technology manager who lives on Cape Cod, Mass., was working for a startup last year when he noticed one of his coders engaging in odd behavior. The contractor had agreed to leave his role with a financial firm to help out Mr. Hansen's team for a few months, per his deal with the staffing agency that hired him, Mr. Hansen says. But even after supposedly making the transition from his last role, the contractor wasn't showing up to meetings. Work he turned in missed the mark. </p><p>\n  It turned out the man hadn't left his original job, Mr. Hansen says. </p><p>\n  Mr. Hansen worried about hitting his own work goals. He felt frustrated and shortchanged. But he opted not to press the issue. </p><p>\n  \"I could have cut him loose, I suppose, but that would have been cutting off my own arm,\" he says. \"It was better to have somebody than nobody.\" </p><p>\n  Besides, the coder was a contractor: no benefits, no job security. Mr. Hansen says he can't help but sympathize a little with contingent workers who game the system. \"What incentive is there for people to be deliberately honest?\" he says. \"That loyalty between employer and employee is vacant.\" </p><p>\n  When Laurie Ruettimann, now a human-resources consultant in Raleigh, N.C., was an HR executive at a Fortune 500 company, she dealt with an employee with a secret side gig. After being exposed by peers, the IT worker admitted the ploy. Ms. Ruettimann and her colleagues put him on a performance-improvement plan. A few months later, he was laid off. </p><p>\n  \"That's not a guy who's built for longevity at an organization,\" she says. </p><p>\n  One computer engineer put in long hours for years, climbing the ladder to become one of his company's most senior engineers. Days were for meetings and strategy, nights and weekends for coding. He felt like he was performing free labor. </p><p>\n  He took a second job last year, figuring he would tap paternity leave at both companies once his pregnant wife delivered their baby, and then return to one job. But, even with the baby born, he can't seem to quit the game. He is earning nearly $500,000, and working as much as 100 hours a week. </p><p>\n  \"It's 100% overwhelming, and my wife's like, 'How long can you do this?'\" he says. But \"every other Friday, when those paychecks drop, I am reinvigorated.\" </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  How to Live a Double </p><p>\n  (Work) Life: A Guide </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Living a double life isn't easy. Colleagues ask to connect on social media. Meetings pile up for the same time slot. Bosses think your only job is the one they're asking you to do. </p><p>\n  Two-gig veterans have honed their craft over months, or years, on the jobs. Here are their tips for keeping the stress low, the payoff high and the whole thing secret. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Set yourself up for success: You want a job that's remote, but it's better if not everyone at the company is working from home, a two-job worker advises. Your best bet is an older company that hasn't quite figured out remote work yet. \"They're not going to have all the processes in place to actually keep track of what everyone is doing,\" he says. \"You have more freedom.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Avoid startups: They expect too much work and might have more visibility into how you're spending your days. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Get your timing right: Don't start two jobs too close together; you don't want to be ramping up and learning the lay of the land at two companies simultaneously. One worker tried that. \"The first three months it was a nightmare,\" he says. \"Then it got easier over time.\" Tap PTO at your first company to have some breathing room in the early days of juggling two jobs. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Get your priorities straight: Think of one job -- the one that requires more of your attention -- as primary. If you can coast at your old company, give priority to face time at your new one. Be visible everywhere, even if it's just a facade. One worker makes sure her light on Microsoft Teams is always green. \"I just want to look like I'm right there,\" she says. \"A lot of it is perception.\" Appearing always on can buy you goodwill if you need to, say, drop from a meeting halfway through. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Dodge meetings: Hit that decline button. \"Just because someone puts a meeting on your calendar in Outlook doesn't mean you have to take it,\" one worker says. \"You're busy.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Master the ones you do take: Be proactive, setting the meetings you need to attend around your own schedule. Block off meetings for job 1 on calendar 2, labeling them \"working sessions.\" And make sure that when you do join a meeting, everyone knows it. \"Ask non-questions, restate what someone just said in different wording,\" one post on the Overemployed website recommends. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Have a story: You'll want excuses and explanations at the ready for tricky moments. Need to dodge a meeting? Say you need \"head-down focus time to finish another deliverable,\" Overemployed recommends. Set low expectations. \"With each milestone, you can explain how difficult it was to reach that milestone and drag out the timeline to the next set of milestones,\" the website advises. Learn the art of letting people down gently so you don't risk them escalating the issue to others. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Stay under the radar: Tap LinkedIn's privacy settings to shield your profile from search engines or hide your connections, so acquaintances are less likely to chat with each other about where you're currently working, the website advises. Need an excuse for not updating your profile? You're worried about hacking and trying not to share too much online. Beware of close encounters in tightknit industries. One worker took himself out of the running for a consulting job after realizing the gig was actually consulting for his current employer -- his department, specifically. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Resist overwork: Boss asking too much of you? You can always drop one job and find another, or just take a breather. One double-job veteran in Europe is currently on a summer break from his approach. \"It's great,\" he says of working just one job, adding that he has been filling his daily four hours of empty time with videogames and personal coding projects. \"I have so much free time.\" </p><p>\n  -- Rachel Feintzeig </p><p></p>",
