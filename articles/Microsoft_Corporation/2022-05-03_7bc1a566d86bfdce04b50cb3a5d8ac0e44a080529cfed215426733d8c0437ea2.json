  "title": "Yellen, Zelensky Among Speakers Set to Discuss Ukraine War at WSJ CEO Council; Other participants include Bill Gates, chief executives of Morgan Stanley, Coca-Cola, Airbnb",
  "text": "<p>The invitation-only event will also bring together business leaders, including Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates, James Gorman of Morgan Stanley, James Quincey of Coca-Cola Co., Brian Chesky of Airbnb Inc. and Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital, a California venture-capital firm focusing on the technology sector.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky has become the face of Ukrainian resistance, helping to bolster morale at home and galvanize public opinion in the West, where he has persuaded governments to deliver increasing volumes of weapons to defend his country. His decision to remain in Kyiv as Russian forces rolled into Ukraine is seen by Western military analysts as critical to the country staying in the fight.</p><p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine has driven energy and other critical prices higher, further fanning inflation world-wide. The pandemic has also shifted working patterns and continues to disrupt supply chains, forcing businesses to get to grips with how many of these shifts are permanent.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How can businesses best navigate the current political and economic climate? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Higher interest rates, meanwhile, have contributed to a rerating of the valuations of technology companies, which are also facing increased scrutiny in different jurisdictions over privacy, their policies toward disinformation and other issues.</p><p>Ms. Yellen is helping lead the U.S.'s response to the Russian invasion, crafting a broad sanctions regime with allies to weaken the Russian economy.</p><p>A central question facing the U.S. and its European allies is how to reduce Russia's revenues from sales of oil and gas. As the European Union moves toward an embargo on Russian oil, Ms. Yellen has warned about the economic consequences of broad bans on Russian energy, arguing that such steps could drastically raise the cost of energy across the world.</p><p>The war in Ukraine has also splintered the broader international economic community, and Ms. Yellen has urged China and countries that have remained nonaligned in the conflict against deepening their ties with Russia. She has cast the war as a referendum on the international financial system the U.S. engineered in the aftermath of World War II.</p><p>Domestically, Ms. Yellen and the Biden administration face the highest inflation in decades. Rising prices have weighed on Democrats' popularity and slowed the passage of their economic agenda in Congress.</p><p>Ms. Yellen is also leading the Biden administration's efforts to understand and further regulate the cryptocurrency industry. The Treasury Department is pushing for Congress to pass legislation regulating stablecoins, a type of digital asset whose value is often pegged to the dollar, while also crafting a series of reports on other segments of the roughly $2 trillion cryptocurrency market.</p><p>Lynda Gratton, professor of management practice at London Business School, will address the future of work. The event also includes a discussion with the British designer Thomas Heatherwick. For her expert perspective on China, Keyu Jin, professor at the London School of Economics, will also address the meeting.</p><p>Write to Stephen Fidler at stephen.fidler@wsj.com and Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com</p><p>Yellen, Zelensky Among Speakers Set to Discuss Ukraine War at WSJ CEO Council</p>",
