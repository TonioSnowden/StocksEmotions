  "text": "<p>\n  AMAZON.COM INC. </p><p>\n  AMZN +0.2% </p><p>\n  A titan of the tech world wants to direct one of Hollywood's most fabled studios. Amazon said Wednesday it agreed to buy MGM Holdings, a pact that would turn a film operation known for classics like \"Singin' in the Rain\" and \"Rocky\" into a streaming asset for the e-commerce giant. The deal is part of a larger consolidation in the media world; last week AT&amp;T agreed to combine its media assets with Discovery Inc. The MGM purchase highlights the premium that content is commanding as streaming wars force consolidation. Amazon's shares rose 0.2% Wednesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  BANK OF AMERICA CORP. </p><p>\n  BAC +0.5% </p><p>\n  A big bank is hanging up on the cold call. Bank of America's Merrill Lynch Wealth Management unit is banning trainee brokers from pushing hot investments on anyone they can get to pick up the phone, a practice once widely viewed within the wealth management industry as a rite of passage. On Monday, Merrill rolled out a revamped adviser-training program that prohibits participants from cold calling and directs would-be brokers to use internal referrals or LinkedIn messages to land clients instead. Bank of America's shares were up 0.5% Monday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  EXXON MOBIL CORP. </p><p>\n  XOM +1.2% </p><p>\n  The ground underneath the oil industry is getting slicker as environmental groups and activist investors step up pressure on companies to address concerns about climate change. Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell PLC suffered significant defeats Wednesday, when a Dutch court ordered Shell to reduce its carbon emissions and an activist investor won at least two Exxon board seats. Exxon's shares rose 1.2% Wednesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  FORD MOTOR CO. </p><p>\n  F +8.5% </p><p>\n  A plan by Ford to boost its electric-vehicle production is picking up speed. Ford executives told investors Wednesday that they expected 40% of the company's global sales to be fully electric by 2030, and that the company would boost spending on electric-vehicle development to $30 billion by 2025, roughly one-third more than it forecast earlier this year. The pledges are part of a tech-centric strategy to electrify much of Ford's vehicle lineup and sharply increase its commercial truck and van business. Its shares rose 8.5% Wednesday to close at their highest level in nearly five years. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  BEST BUY CO. </p><p>\n  BBY +1% </p><p>\n  Is America running out of TVs? Best Buy is rushing to stock enough televisions and appliances to sell in its stores amid surging demand from U.S. consumers. Comparable sales at Best Buy shot up 37% during the company's quarter that ended this month as it worked to navigate supply-chain challenges, and Best Buy Chief Executive Corie Barry said she expects \"inventory constraints\" through the rest of 2021. The situation is a sharp turn from the depths of the pandemic, when many retail executives worried about whether shoppers would ever return. Best Buy's shares rose 1% Thursday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  HCA HEALTHCARE INC. </p><p>\n  HCA +0.8% </p><p>\n  A national hospital chain wants to Google its patient health records. HCA Healthcare and Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit announced an agreement Wednesday to develop healthcare algorithms from digital health records and internet-connected medical devices. The companies said this would help improve operating efficiency, monitor patients and guide doctors' decisions. Google has previously reached deals with other prominent U.S. hospital systems that granted access to personal patient information, drawing public scrutiny. HCA shares rose 0.8% Wednesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  HP INC. </p><p>\n  HPQ -8.9% </p><p>\n  Will demand for the PC wane once the pandemic fades? HP Inc. Chief Executive Enrique Lores said Thursday he expects personal computers to remain a hot item into next year, as the company posted a roughly 27% jump in second-quarter revenue and raised its full-year earnings outlook. A pandemic-fueled run on computers helped HP deliver strong results despite a semiconductor shortage that is denting some industries. Investors may not yet be convinced the good times can continue. HP shares dropped 8.9% Friday. </p><p></p>",
