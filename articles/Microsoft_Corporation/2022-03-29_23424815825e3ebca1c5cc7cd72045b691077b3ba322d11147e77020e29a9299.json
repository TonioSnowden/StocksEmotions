  "text": "<p>The company agreed in September to pay $18 million as part of a settlement with the EEOC, which had been examining allegations of gender-based harassment and retaliation at the embattled videogame-publishing giant.</p><p>In addition to the $18 million fund to compensate eligible claimants, the company said it agreed to engage a neutral, third-party equal employment opportunity consultant – a non-employee who must be approved by the EEOC – who will oversee Activision's compliance with its agreement, among other aspects.</p><p>“Our goal is to make Activision Blizzard a model for the industry, and we will continue to focus on eliminating harassment and discrimination from our workplace,” Activision Chief Executive Bobby Kotick said in a statement.</p><p>The EEOC since 2018 had been looking into the allegations, according to a complaint the agency filed against Activision in U.S. District Court shortly before the settlement. The EEOC's complaint said Activision employees were subjected to “sexual harassment that was severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment.” The Wall Street Journal in November reported that Mr. Kotick knew for years about sexual misconduct allegations at the company.</p><p>Microsoft Corp. MSFT agreed to buy Activision in an all-cash deal valued at about $75 billion in January.</p>",
