  "text": "<p>About 19% of cyber risk executives are highly confident in their organization's ability to understand and respond to cyber threats, according to a more than 660-person survey published Thursday by Marsh &amp; McLennan Co.'s insurance brokering business and Microsoft Corp.</p><p>\"It reflects that, despite the significant amount of time and energy and resource that organizations are spending on cyber, the risk environment continues to evolve and expand such that it's difficult to get ahead of it or get on top of it,\" said Thomas Reagan, cyber risk practice leader for the U.S. and Canada at Marsh.</p><p>Verizon Communications Inc.'s annual Data Breach Investigations Report, published last week, found that ransomware's involvement in data breaches rose by 13% over the course of the past year, more than the increase in the previous five years combined.</p><p>Many attacks remained relatively unsophisticated and largely relied on human error rather than technology prowess, said Sowmyanarayan Sampath, chief revenue officer at Verizon. \"It's not James Bond stuff,\" he said.</p><p>The pandemic pushed many companies to reorient their security postures to protect employees working remotely and outside traditional corporate cyber defenses. That shift, coupled with the growth in criminal operations using ransomware, contributed to a sharp increase in such attacks during the pandemic.</p><p>Criminal groups have demanded ransoms as high as tens of millions of dollars to unlock some companies' data, disrupting critical infrastructure operators such as Colonial Pipeline Co. and meatpacker JBS Foods SA last spring.</p><p>The federal government has tried to meet the threat by collaborating more with corporate security teams and unveiling a menu of more aggressive standards for the public and private sectors. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, announced last week that it is setting up a task force on ransomware.</p><p>The government likely knows about just one-quarter of such incidents due to underreporting by companies and disclosures spread across different federal agencies, according to a report last week by the Senate Homeland Security Committee.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
