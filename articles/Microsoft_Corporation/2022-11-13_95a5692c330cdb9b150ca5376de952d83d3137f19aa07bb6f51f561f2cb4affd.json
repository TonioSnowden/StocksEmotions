  "text": "<p>THERE ARE a few counties in America that gain particular fame on election nights, or, lately, election weeks. In 2020 it was Maricopa County in Arizona, which became the unfortunate centre of election conspiracy theories. In this year's midterm elections all eyes were on Nevada's Clark County, which includes Las Vegas. On Saturday the final batch of postal ballots from there handed victory in the Senate race to Catherine Cortez Masto, and delivered the Democratic Party the final seat it needed to retain control of the upper chamber. With the Republican Party crawling towards a slim majority in the House of Representatives, Congress looks to be heading towards gridlock.</p><p>But first the parties will grapple with the results of the election. That will be less fun for the Republicans, who find themselves in a sour mood despite their probable victory in the House. The president's party typically loses about 30 seats in modern midterm elections. House Republicans hoped for a red wave fed by inflation, Joe Biden's low approval ratings, and voters' worries about crime and immigration. Yet the Democrats may lose only a handful of seats, handing them a historic success even in defeat.</p><p>The Senate map may soon look even better for Democrats than it did before the elections. John Fetterman managed to flip a seat in Pennsylvania, and two vulnerable incumbents held on in Nevada and Arizona. In Arizona Mark Kelly, a centrist Democrat and former astronaut, beat Blake Masters, who had been endorsed by Donald Trump, by several points. America will not know the final Senate results until December, when Georgia holds its run-off election. Raphael Warnock, the Democratic incumbent, will again face off against Herschel Walker, a former American-football star backed by Mr Trump. Should Mr Warnock win, the Democrats will have 51 seats to the Republicans' 49. If so Kamala Harris, who as vice-president breaks ties in a 50-50 Senate, would have more free time.</p><p>Not everyone is done campaigning. Mr Masters has previously parroted Donald Trump's lies that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. He recently applied that flawed logic to his own race, alleging that some ballots were “mixed up”. “The most honest thing”, Mr Masters said dishonestly, “would be for Maricopa County to wipe the slate clean.” Bill Gates, a Republican election official there, called claims of a dysfunctional counting process “absolutely false” and “offensive”. The Twitter account for Maricopa County also weighed in. “DISINFORMATION SUPER SPREADERS,” it tweeted. “Please read Arizona election law &amp; the elections procedures manual before asking leading questions about how something seems suspicious.”</p><p>Once Arizona turned blue, all eyes shifted to Nevada—specifically to Clark County in southern Nevada, where three-quarters of Nevadans live and which leans Democratic. In 2020 postal votes nationally favoured Democrats, who were more likely to vote by mail during the covid-19 pandemic. That trend seems to have continued in 2022. With every batch of postal votes released from Clark County, Ms Cortez Masto narrowed Adam Laxalt's lead before finally surpassing him.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Republican candidate for governor, Joe Lombardo, triumphed over the Democratic incumbent, Steve Sisolak. That a Republican won the governor's race while a Democrat won the Senate contest suggests that some independent voters split their ticket. Mr Laxalt comes from a long line of politicians, but he helped chair Mr Trump's 2020 campaign in the state, and questioned the integrity of that election. One of the lessons from these midterms seems to be that Americans are not overly keen to undermine their democracy.</p><p>The Republicans are looking for someone to blame, and Donald Trump has become the culprit-in-chief. Many of the far-right candidates he endorsed—mainly because they echoed his conspiracy theories—were defeated by more moderate Democratic opponents. In swing states, every election-denying secretary of state candidate, and almost all those running for governor, lost their races. A possible exception is Kari Lake, who made the “Big Lie” central to her gladiatorial campaign to be Arizona's next governor. As of Sunday morning, that race was too close to call.</p><p>Kevin McCarthy had hoped to cruise to the speakership of the House, but there is now talk of delayed leadership elections and a possible mutiny from the far-right Freedom Caucus. Several senators have also argued for delaying the vote until after the Georgia runoff. Even if Mr McCarthy does replace Nancy Pelosi as speaker, his standing among his colleagues may be diminished.</p><p>Divided government makes the prospect of legislating grim. Because gridlock is coming, Democrats may try to push through a few remaining priorities in the lame-duck session, including a bill to make it easier to get approval for new energy projects and a revival of the child tax credit. But fiscal fights over raising the debt ceiling and funding the government may take precedence. Meanwhile the 2024 presidential campaign looks set to begin as soon as Mr Trump officially declares his candidacy, possibly as early as Tuesday. Americans hoping for a sleepy post-election period are about to be disappointed.</p><p>■</p>",
