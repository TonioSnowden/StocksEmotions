  "text": "<p>Eric Adams is poised to become <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ec33dd0-8cd7-46a4-adaf-f6185fcb614e\">the next mayor of New York City</a> after winning the Democratic party nomination by a slim margin over fellow challengers. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1004e86-9af0-4765-839a-f09659db6c4c\">retired black police captain</a>, who has promised to restore order to New York City's streets, secured 50.5 per cent of the vote to 49.5 per cent for Kathryn Garcia, the former head of the sanitation department, according to the city's board of elections' latest tally. Maya Wiley, the leading progressive candidate, came third.</p> <p>Adams and Garcia were separated by 8,426 votes, with only about 3,700 outstanding.</p> <p>Although the results were unofficial and may still be challenged, the Associated Press called the primary for Adams last night.</p> <p>The result was thrown into doubt last week after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ce4639c-6d96-4b69-9d82-e1ae25f65e48\">an extraordinary blunder</a> by the election board led to a mistaken count and threw the city's first ranked choice election into disarray.</p> <p>Adams ran as a moderate who is uniquely capable of using the police to tackle soaring gun violence and hate crime while at the same time reforming the department. Both Adams and rival Garcia, who showed a late burst of support, rejected progressive calls to “defund” the police.</p> <p>Given New York City's overwhelming number of Democratic voters, the winner of the party's primary is widely expected to prevail in November's general election.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Pentagon cancels $10bn cloud contract</strong> The US defence department has reversed its decision to award a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ac0e691-665f-4328-8b29-ee4883068e80\">highly sensitive $10bn cloud computing contract</a> solely to Microsoft. Amazon had accused former president Donald Trump of putting pressure on the Pentagon to award the contract to its rival because of his animus towards founder Jeff Bezos. The Pentagon said yesterday it would start a new procurement process.</p> <p><strong>2. Rubio lambasts Didi listing </strong>The Republican senator from Florida told the Financial Times it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b82d5307-256c-4791-9847-67ad9f6f689c\">“reckless and irresponsible”</a> to allow Didi Chuxing, which he described as an “unaccountable Chinese company”, to sell shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares in the Chinese ride-hailing app <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/095eb7ac-09ea-4a5c-8253-d8ca2d945614\">lost a fifth of their value yesterday</a> after Beijing said it would act to strengthen the protection of sensitive data.&#xa0;The FT editorial board's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c52658d-4272-4e41-9570-db49f641c832\">view</a>: </p> <blockquote>  <p>“Western investors have, once again, found themselves caught in the midst of a battle between Chinese businesses and the state.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3. UAE-Saudi brinkmanship threatens Opec unity</strong> Brent, the international benchmark, reached <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0b77371-fdd3-4650-81e7-9b5e51f27bb9\">a three-year high yesterday</a> as the disagreement between Saudi Arabia, Opec's de facto leader, and the UAE, a close, previously co-operative partner, triggered a briefing war between the two camps. The rift could yet see the UAE, an Opec member since 1967, leave the group.
