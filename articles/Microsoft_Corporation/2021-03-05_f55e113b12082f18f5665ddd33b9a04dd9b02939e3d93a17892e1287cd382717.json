  "title": "Technology:  Google Competitor Gains Ground  ---  Ad buyer Trade Desk's  market share leaps as  it finds new digital  segments to invest in  ----  By Patience Haggin",
  "text": "<p>   Alphabet Inc.'s Google has crushed almost all its competitors in the world of digital-advertising technology. But one rival is emerging as the best hope to challenge the tech giant -- if it manages to keep up its momentum. </p><p>   Trade Desk Inc., which specializes in helping companies buy online ads across publishers' websites, did what others failed at: eat into Google's share of the market. While Google dominates that area of ad-buying with about 40% of the business, Trade Desk is up to nearly 8% and its share is growing faster than Google's, according to ad-tech consulting firm Jounce Media. </p><p>   Trade Desk made inroads versus Google by investing in online ad segments like audio and streaming TV where Google hadn't cornered the market. Pandemic-struck 2020 was especially good for business. Homebound Americans consumed more digital media. Brands moved money from TV advertising to digital. Trade Desk revenue shot up 26% compared with 2019, hitting $836 million. </p><p>   Investors saw Trade Desk as a haven, and it was one of 2020's top performing stocks, as its share price tripled. With a $30 billion market capitalization, the Ventura, Calif., company is worth about as much as the two largest ad-agency conglomerates combined. </p><p>   Trade Desk Chief Executive Jeff Green embraces the company's role as the anti-Google, but has no illusions about how difficult it is to take on the tech powerhouse. For starters, Trade Desk is competing in only one corner of the ad market: Most of marketers' dollars flow directly to Google and to other big platforms' own properties, like YouTube and Search, outside the reach of companies like Trade Desk. </p><p>   Google's announcement Wednesday that it will end targeting of ads based on individual users' web-browsing behavior, and focus on targeting based on larger groups or \"cohorts,\" could pose risks for Trade Desk. </p><p>   Billed as a privacy move, the change could play to Google's strengths, Mr. Green and others in the industry say, because it has so much other data to use for targeting ads. </p><p>   \"They are leaning on an advantage that they have from very big near-monopoly businesses so that they can provide targeted advertising while they're taking steps to inhibit others' ability to provide targeted advertising,\" Mr. Green said. </p><p>   Antitrust authorities in the U.S. and abroad are investigating various elements of Google's business. \"This is a big move that should be looked at,\" Mr. Green said of Google's new targeting policy. </p><p>   \"We do not believe ad tracking across the web meets the needs of consumers,\" a Google spokesman said, adding that the company will support ad targeting that uses \"first party\" data that companies collect on their customers. </p><p>   \"First-party relationships have always been critical for brands to build a successful business, and it'll become even more vital in a privacy-first world,\" the spokesman said. </p><p>   Trade Desk's stock fell nearly 13% on Wednesday as investors worried Google's announcement would reshape the industry at Trade Desk's expense. The company's shares declined 8% Thursday. Mr. Green said the firm has an opportunity to build an alternative targeting technology that can be the main rival to the approach Google is laying out. </p><p>   The University of Southern California graduate worked in ad tech, then founded two ad-tech startups and sold the second one to Microsoft Corp. He founded Trade Desk in 2009. He made the company profitable after raising $7 million in venture capital, and raised $120 million by the time of its 2016 initial public offering. Mr. Green holds 53.5% of his company's voting power and 10.75% of its stock, a stake valued at about $3 billion. </p><p>   In online advertising, there are tools for every stage of the ad-placing process -- putting space up for sale, auctioning it and interfacing with buyers. Trade Desk focused squarely on the buying side, betting it could persuade clients it wouldn't be burdened with conflicts from playing on all sides of the marketplace. </p><p>   Trade Desk forged direct relationships with publishers and media companies like Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal, Conde Nast, Fox Corp., Wall Street Journal parent News Corp, Spotify, TikTok and Vox Media, gaining the right to post their ad space directly on Trade Desk's systems. Those arrangements cut out the middlemen in ad transactions, pleasing buyers and sellers. </p><p>   Next year, Trade Desk will face a big challenge when Google removes third-party \"cookies\" from its market-leading Chrome browser. Cookies are text files advertisers use to amass data on users' web activity that can inform how to target ads. </p><p>   Google's decision Wednesday to move away from individualized user tracking in its own ad operations means digital advertising could bifurcate, with a Google ecosystem that has one set of rules and the rest of the web following another. </p><p></p>",
