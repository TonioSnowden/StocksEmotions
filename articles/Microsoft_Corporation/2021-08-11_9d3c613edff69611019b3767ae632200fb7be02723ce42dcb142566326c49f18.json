  "title": "Climate Accounting  Looms for Companies  ---  Investors and regulators want better data;  firms' current ESG ratings are inconsistent  ----  By Jean Eaglesham and Shane Shifflett",
  "text": "<p>   From farm to bottler to supermarket cooler, a liter of Coca-Cola creates 346 grams of carbon dioxide emissions, the company's data show. </p><p>   That's less than half the tree-to-toilet 771-gram carbon footprint of a mega roll of Charmin Ultra Soft, as measured by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. </p><p>   Math like this is fast becoming obligatory. Investors are increasing pressure on businesses to disclose the emissions of greenhouse gases related to their products and services. Regulators are starting to ask about that, too. Within the next couple of years, every public company in the U.S. might well be required to report climate information. </p><p>   Such an effort would be the biggest potential expansion in corporate disclosure since the creation of the Depression-era rules over financial disclosures that underpin modern corporate statements. Already it has kicked off a confusing melee as companies, regulators and environmentalists argue over the proper way to account for carbon. </p><p>   U.S. and European regulators demand or are expected to require that public companies disclose their greenhouse-gas emissions. That might include the emissions produced by their suppliers and customers. </p><p>   Regulators also want better disclosure of climate-related risks for companies. These can range from effects from extreme weather to financial risks such as if a fossil-fuel asset loses value. </p><p>   \"When it comes to disclosure, investors have told us what they want,\" Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said in a speech last month. \"It's now time for the commission to take the baton.\" </p><p>   The demands for climate-related information carry weight as \"green\" financial products surge in popularity. Some $51 billion poured into sustainable U.S. mutual funds and exchange-traded funds last year, according to data provider Morningstar Inc. That was almost 10 times the level of 2018 and represented nearly a quarter of the cash that went into all U.S. stock and bond funds last year, Morningstar said. </p><p>   The SEC is working on a potential climate-disclosure regulation. It has the backing of the White House, which has called for drastic cuts in  emissions. Countries in Europe already require that companies doing business there honor governments' demands for climate disclosures. </p><p>   Regulators say climate change poses specific risks investors should be told about. Among them is the risk that companies producing a lot of greenhouse gases could be avoided by some lenders, insurers or investors, either because those parties see the companies as harming the environment or because they view the companies' businesses as vulnerable. A scientific panel working under the auspices of the United Nations stated in a report Monday that effects of a warming climate are unequivocally driven by greenhouse-gas emissions from human activity. </p><p>   Corporations already pump out forests-worth of environmental data voluntarily. They are responding to requests for information from investors interested in businesses that have good environmental, social and governance, or ESG, records. Rating firms use the company information to help create ESG grades widely followed by investors. </p><p>   Currently, the ratings are inconsistent and incomplete. A Wall Street Journal analysis of ESG grades issued for nearly 1,500 companies by three rating firms found that nearly two-thirds -- 942 companies -- got different grades from different raters. The Journal collected ratings from the websites of three prominent ratings firms in May -- Refinitiv Holdings Ltd., MSCI Inc. and  Sustainalytics -- and identified 1,469 companies scored by all three. </p><p>   Nearly a third were deemed ESG leaders by one or more rating firms but labeled ESG laggards by another rater. </p><p>   Oil giant Chevron Corp. earned top marks for \"excellent relative ESG performance\" from Refinitiv, a unit of London Stock Exchange Group PLC. MSCI gave Chevron an average rating. And Chevron got a worst-possible \"severe risk\" grade from Sustainalytics, owned by Morningstar. </p><p>   One reason for the difference: The Refinitiv score put more weight on social issues, such as workforce diversity, than on Chevron's fossil-fuels dependence, the Journal's analysis showed. </p><p>   \"All ratings providers are measuring different things,\" said Julia Giguere-Morello, ESG research director at MSCI. \"Some are much more risk-focused, some are impact-focused, some are values-based.\" </p><p>    Lisa Epifani, Chevron's ESG and sustainability manager, said ESG scores should \"come with a bit ofa warning\" that different methodologies can lead to widely varying scores. </p><p>   Some green funds own companies with poor ESG scores from at least one rater. BlackRock Inc.'s iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA exchange-traded fund owns Chevron shares. A BlackRock spokesman said, \"We also offer funds that provide targeted exposure to specific sustainable outcomes or some that screen out fossil fuel companies along with a range of other industries.\" </p><p>   Another headache for investors picking green stocks is the variation in how companies report climate information. Most of the biggest 500 U.S. public companies produce annual sustainability reports. The glossy documents share a taste for photos of happy employees and blooming plants. The quality and breadth of their data differ significantly, and little is audited. </p><p>    Twitter Inc., which says it wants to be \"good stewards to our planet,\" doesn't disclose its greenhouse-gas emissions or give a numerical target for reducing them. It says it will set a target within two years. Meanwhile, Twitter highlights efforts it has made such as removing 70,000 plastic toothbrushes from its offices. </p><p>   By contrast, Microsoft Corp.'s 96-page data-heavy report breaks down its emissions into more than a dozen categories, including those resulting from energy consumption, transportation, employee commuting and the use and disposal of its products. </p><p>   A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment. Microsoft said it is \"committed to transparency on sustainability.\" </p><p>    Berkshire Hathaway Inc., led by Warren Buffett, stands out for the paucity of its disclosure. It doesn't report overall climate-related risks. Its Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, which owns utilities and coal plants, said in a three-page sustainability report: \"We strive to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions.\" It put no date on the target. </p><p>    Cathy Woollums, chief sustainability officer at Berkshire Hathaway Energy, said it plans to close all coal-fueled units and to have \"minimal\" greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. declined to comment. </p><p>    Tesla Inc. discloses the life-cycle emissions of a Model 3 car but not emissions for the company as a whole. Procter &amp; Gamble releases carbon dioxide data companywide but not for individual products. Coca-Cola Co.until recently set a yearly target for reducing \"drink in your hand\" carbon dioxide emissions related to the production, sale and consumption of a single drink. It has since switched to a goal of reducing total emissions. </p><p>   In figuring the carbon footprint of P&amp;G's Charmin Ultra Soft, the Natural Resources Defense Council used a calculator from a green advocacy group called the Environmental Paper Network. </p><p>   P&amp;G said the footprint was based on \"general data not specific to P&amp;G supply chains, manufacturing, or disposal.\" A spokesman for the Environmental Paper Network said its calculator, which uses industry averages, is \"a science-based, trusted, independent tool.\" </p><p>   Greenhouse-gas emissions are in three categories, according to an international framework. Those resulting from company operations are called Scope 1. There also are Scope 2, resulting from energy the company buys. And there are Scope 3 emissions related to their products but produced by their employees, suppliers and customers, such as during suppliers' transportation. </p><p>   These are a \"tremendous challenge\" to measure, Walt Disney Co. said in a report on its 2030 environmental goals, but it aims to start reporting them by the end of next year nonetheless. Energy company EOG Resources Inc. said in its 2019 sustainability report it \"does not believe that it is able to calculate Scope 3 emissions with the accuracy and rigor typically required for EOG's publicly reported data.\" </p><p>   Coca-Cola, in figuring emissions from employee business travel, looks at flights only; Verizon Communications Inc. includes air and rail travel; AT&amp;T Inc. counts emissions from employees' air, rail and car travel and is looking at adding travel with ride-share companies. </p><p>    Ben Jordan, senior director of environmental policy at Coca-Cola, said for a global corporation, air travel is much more significant than any other mode. Verizon said it plans to expand its reporting to emissions from rental cars, taxis and hotels. AT&amp;T declined to comment. </p><p>   The SEC's Mr. Gensler said in his speech last month he has asked staff to recommend how companies might disclose their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, \"along with whether to disclose Scope 3 emissions -- and if so, how and under what circumstances.\" </p><p>   Some asset managers say they seek climate data because they want to invest in businesses that can adapt. \"Our goal to de-risk our client portfolios,\" said Jonathan Bailey, head of ESG investing at Neuberger Berman Group LLC. </p><p>   Companies would take climate disclosure more seriously, and it would be more accurate, if it were mandated and checked by an outsider, said Rick Love, who retired last year as director of environmental sustainability at United Technologies Corp. soon after it merged with Raytheon Co. </p><p>   A Journal review of climate reporting by the 50 largest companies in the S&amp;P 500 found most used an outside auditor for some of the data they voluntarily reported, but verification was significantly less thorough than for financial statements. </p><p>   The SEC appears determined to use its rule-making power to impose order on the free for all. Mr. Gensler said in his speech that he has asked agency staff to prepare proposed rules for mandatory climate-risk disclosure by the end of the year. </p><p></p>",
