  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n   Activision Blizzard had really better hope the Microsoft deal pulls through. </p><p>\n  In the month since the two companies announced their agreement to merge, Activision's situation has deteriorated further. Federal and state regulators are widening their probes into the company's problems with workplace misconduct. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the latest efforts include subpoenas to police departments in the Los Angeles area for any records on several current and former employees, including current Chief Executive Bobby Kotick. </p><p>\n  And late on Tuesday Bloomberg News reported the company is planning to skip its \"Call of Duty\" installment planned for next year. That would be the first time the blockbuster game has gone without an annual release since 2005. Activision hasn't yet confirmed that decision, though it did say it still planned \"an exciting slate of premium and free-to-play Call of Duty experiences\" this year and next. Even so, a decision to skip a full sequel would come in the wake of a misfire with the late 2021 release of \"Call of Duty: Vanguard.\" But such a move would be in keeping with an industrywide shift to games that operate as always-on services. The Bloomberg article noted that Treyarch -- the Activision studio originally tasked with developing next year's \"Call of Duty\" title -- will instead work on a free-to-play online game from the franchise. </p><p>\n  Still, in the short-run it would be a painful move financially. \"Call of Duty\" is Activision's largest property by far, accounting for more than a third of the company's total annual revenue, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. But the stock ticked down only a fraction on Wednesday, remaining buoyed in the low $80 range by Microsoft's buyout offer. Doug Creutz of Cowen wrote Wednesday that the prospect of a missed \"Call of Duty\" installment next year would likely send the stock into the $50s compared with the $65 price the shares were fetching before the Microsoft deal was unveiled on Jan. 18. </p><p>\n  But making a painful decision now could end up helping Microsoft in the longer term. As the 18th sequel in as many years, \"Call of Duty: Vanguard\" seems to have pushed the series into franchise fatigue. Critic scores averaged by Metacritic have been slipping steadily over the past four installments, and those for \"Vanguard\" were the lowest in franchise history following the game's Nov. 5 release. Activision admitted in its fourth-quarter report on Feb. 3 that the title fell short of expectations; analysts estimate that total \"Call of Duty\" revenue in the fourth quarter slid 27% from the same period the previous year, according to Visible Alpha. </p><p>\n  None of this would have been news to Microsoft. According to Activision's regulatory filing last week detailing the background of the deal, the company's long-term financial plans were \"downwardly adjusted\" on Dec. 14 due to the game's underperformance. Those plans were shared with Microsoft as part of negotiations between the two companies. Microsoft operates a major game distribution platform with the Xbox Live store, which would have given the company an even earlier sense of the poor performance of \"Vanguard.\" Activision's filing notes that Microsoft first reached out to the company on Nov. 19 -- two weeks after \"Vanguard\" went on sale. </p><p>\n  Moving \"Call of Duty\" off an annual cycle could help extend the life of the franchise. Andrew Uerkwitz of Jefferies noted Wednesday that \"Call of Duty\" was \"suffocating under its own weight and schedule,\" and added that Microsoft has other major shooter franchises like \"Halo\" and \"Gears of War\" that are successful without annual releases. A weaker Activision could help Microsoft defend itself against antitrust scrutiny. Even the industry's biggest franchise is showing that it is hardly bulletproof. </p><p></p>",
