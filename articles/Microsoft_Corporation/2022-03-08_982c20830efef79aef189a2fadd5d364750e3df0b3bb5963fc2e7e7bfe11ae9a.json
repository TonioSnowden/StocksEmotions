  "title": "Google to Buy Cybersecurity Firm Mandiant in $5.4 Billion Deal; Cybersecurity investments have been hot among tech companies, as they beef up those services for customers amid a surge in cyberattacks",
  "text": "<p>In buying Mandiant, Google provides a boost to its cloud business, which is rapidly growing but remains smaller than its key rivals. In the most recent quarter, the business saw revenue rise by about 45% to $5.54 billion, or about 7% of the company's total quarterly revenue.</p><p>Thomas Kurian, chief executive of Google Cloud, said that Google wanted to draw from the insights of Mandiant's threat research in how it applies security solutions to its products, and that the computing giant intended to retain the Mandiant brand.</p><p>Mandiant was a pioneer in the cybersecurity industry in publishing detailed reports about malicious cyber campaigns and identifying the likely nation-state sponsor of the intrusions. U.S. intelligence agencies have come to rely on the insights provided by Mandiant and other companies that shed light on the motives and tactics of hackers in Russia, China, Iran and elsewhere.</p><p>Kevin Mandia, the chief executive of Mandiant, said he was drawn to Google as a buyer because of a desire to better automate cybersecurity and the need to better secure cloud environments from hackers.</p><p>\"I don't look at this as selling my baby. I look at it as moving the mission forward,\" Mr. Mandia said.</p><p>Mr. Mandia, an Air Force veteran, founded Mandiant in 2004, years before nation-state hacks had become regular front-page news. In 2013, Mandiant published a groundbreaking report detailing China's espionage campaign. Months later, it was acquired by the security company FireEye Inc., which spun out the Mandiant business last year.</p><p>Mandiant is often called by corporations after they discover that they have been hacked. That type of activity, from criminal ransomware groups and nation-state hackers, is increasingly based in the cloud. With the deal, Mandiant will gain widespread visibility into one of the world's largest cloud environments.</p><p>\"I would argue now that Google is now the most powerful company in the world when it comes to security,\" said Dave DeWalt, former chief executive of Mandiant when it was known as FireEye. \"The flip side is this is one of the biggest culture clashes I might have ever seen in an acquisition.\"</p><p>Now a cybersecurity investor, Mr. DeWalt compared Mandiant to a defense contractor, with deep ties to the U.S. government and employees from the national-security and intelligence communities. \"You put that inside a company that tries to sell products and it gets to be an interesting tension,\" he said.</p><p>The acquisition will also test the degree to which Google can use Mandiant's consulting services to sell automated cybersecurity tools tailored to cloud-only environments, said Alex Henderson, a cybersecurity analyst at investment bank Needham Group Inc.</p><p>\"It's not a great fit, in my opinion,\" he said.</p><p>The deal will put Google into more direct competition with Microsoft Corp., which operates its own security incident response business and is considered by analysts to have the most mature strategy of cloud providers as a seller of security products. Microsoft has pegged annual revenue for its security business at $15 billion.</p><p>Mr. Mandia said he didn't anticipate an acquisition by Google would result in any business complications that could stifle the threat research that his company has built its brand on. He and Mr. Kurian declined to comment on whether the acquisition would lead to layoffs.</p><p>Cybersecurity investments have been hot among tech companies, as they try to offer those services to customers. Microsoft had reportedly also expressed interest in a takeover of Mandiant last month.</p><p>Cyberattacks linked to Russia in the run-up to the country's invasion of Ukraine have only heightened awareness about such threats.</p><p>Cybersecurity</p><p>* Cyberattacks, Hacks and Misinformation: The Many Fronts of Russia's Hybrid War in Ukraine (Feb. 26)</p><p>* Amid Warnings of Cyberattacks in Ukraine, U.S. Companies 'Sitting and Waiting' (Feb. 25)</p><p>Google agreed to pay $23 in cash for each outstanding share of Mandiant, which represents a 2.3% premium over Monday's closing price of $22.49 for Mandiant.</p><p>The deal price is a nearly 53% premium over the Reston, Va., company's closing price of $15.06 on Feb. 7, before published reports emerged that Microsoft was circling Mandiant.</p><p>Shares of Mandiant fell about 2.5% in late morning trading Tuesday to $21.93.</p><p>For Google, the deal marks one of its biggest bets yet, only smaller than its purchase of Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion.</p><p>The companies said the deal is expected to close later this year. Google has faced intense regulatory scrutiny for smaller acquisitions. It took more than a year for Google to close its $2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit LLC as regulators took a close look at the deal.</p><p>Google is contesting antitrust lawsuits from the Justice Department and multiple states over conduct related to its flagship search engine and digital-ad business, based on allegations the company says are deeply flawed.</p><p>Robert McMillan contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com, Dustin Volz at dustin.volz@wsj.com and David Uberti at david.uberti@wsj.com</p><p>Google to Buy Cybersecurity Firm Mandiant in $5.4 Billion Deal</p>",
