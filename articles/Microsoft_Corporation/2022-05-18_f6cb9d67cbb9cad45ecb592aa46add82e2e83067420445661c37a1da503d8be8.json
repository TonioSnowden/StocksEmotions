  "title": "Tuesday's Markets:  High-Tech,  Banking  Stocks  Lead Rally  ----  By Caitlin McCabe and Alexander Osipovich",
  "text": "<p>   Stock indexes posted strong gains as investors snapped up beaten-down shares in the technology, banking, airline and other sectors. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 climbed 80.84 points, or 2%, to 4088.85. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 431.17 points, or 1.3%, to 32654.59. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 321.73 points, or 2.8%, to 11984.52, rebounding after it fell 1.2% on Monday. </p><p>   Stocks have taken a beating in recent weeks on wide-ranging economic, geopolitical and Covid-19 concerns. Weighing most heavily on many investors' minds is the outlook for the U.S. economy as the Federal Reserve lifts interest rates to combat inflation. </p><p>   On Tuesday, fresh data from the Commerce Department showed some signs of economic resilience, with U.S. shoppers increasing retail spending in April for the fourth consecutive month. That, as well as the reopening of some stores in Shanghai this week after a strict Covid-19 lockdown, provided some sources of optimism. </p><p>   Stocks briefly pared gains Tuesday afternoon as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell voiced resolve in fighting inflation, before indexes climbed back toward new session highs. \"There could be some pain involved\" in restoring price stability, Mr. Powell said in remarks at The Wall Street Journal's Future of Everything Festival. </p><p>   Morgan Stanley has a year-end price target of 3900 for the S&amp;P 500, implying that the index still has further to fall. Last week, the S&amp;P 500 was on the cusp of dropping into a bear market, defined as a fall of at least 20% from a recent high. As of the close, the index was down about 15% from its January record. </p><p>   Tech was the best-performing sector of the S&amp;P 500 on Tuesday. Chip maker Nvidia and electric-car maker Tesla both advanced more than 5%, while Apple, Microsoft, PayPal Holdings and Zoom Video Communications all gained more than 2%. </p><p>   Shares of Citigroup rallied $3.59, or 7.6%, to $51.05 after a securities filing showed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought shares valued at about $3 billion. Paramount Global and Ally Financial -- other companies in which Berkshire invested -- also rallied. </p><p>   United Airlines surged $3.43, or 7.9%, to $46.97 after lifting its revenue outlook due to improved travel demand. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines posted big gains. </p><p>   Twitter gained 93 cents, or 2.5%, to $38.32, after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said his $44 billion bid for the social-media company can't move forward until the company is clearer about how many of its accounts are fake. </p><p>   Twitter has wiped out all the gains it notched after Mr. Musk disclosed a stake in the company in April and is trading well below his deal that values the company at $54.20 a share. </p><p>   Walmart slumped $16.86, or 11%, to $131.35 -- retreating to its lowest level in more than a year -- after the retailer reported that earnings fell sharply. Home Depot rose $4.96, or 1.7%, to $300.95 after postingan improved outlook for the year and said shoppers were spending more per shopping trip. </p><p>   In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.969% from 2.877% Monday. </p><p>   The price of bitcoin rose 0.7% to $30,080.86 at 5 p.m. in New York. </p><p>   Brent crude oil, the international energy benchmark, fell 2% to settle at $111.93 a barrel. </p><p>   The Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 1.2%, its third consecutive winning session. Gains across the region were broad-based, with banks, transport companies and energy producers rising. Early Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.7%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 0.7% and the Shanghai Composite was down 0.6%. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 0.1%. </p><p></p>",
