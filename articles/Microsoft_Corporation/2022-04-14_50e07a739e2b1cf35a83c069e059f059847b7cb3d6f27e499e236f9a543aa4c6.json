Ms. Proctor's resignation was effective Wednesday.</p><p>Bloomberg News earlier reported that Ms. Proctor had accused Mr. Newsom's office of meddling in the Activision case, citing an email Ms. Proctor had sent to staff.</p><p>\"Claims of interference by our office are categorically false,\" said Erin Mellon, a spokeswoman for Mr. Newsom, in an email. Activision didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>DFEH Director Kevin Kish said that his department \"has litigated groundbreaking cases that are a model of effective government enforcement of civil rights. \"We continue to do so with the full support of the administration,\" he said.</p><p>The day Ms. Wipper was told she was being terminated was the same day a California judge approved an $18 million settlement between Activision and the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p><p>The EEOC had been investigating the company for sexual-harassment and retaliation allegations. The company had agreed last year to settle with the agency, but the two entities became locked in a monthslong legal battle with the DFEH. That agency said its lawsuit against Activision could be ruined by the EEOC case.</p><p>The exits at the state agency come amid a lawsuit that it filed last summer against Activision, alleging female employees got fewer opportunities to advance and were paid less than their male counterparts.</p><p>Microsoft Corp. agreed this year to buy Activision for $75 billion.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
