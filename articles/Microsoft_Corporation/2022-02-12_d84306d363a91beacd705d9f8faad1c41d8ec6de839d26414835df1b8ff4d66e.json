  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Personal Board of Directors: Jeff Lawson --- CEO, Twilio Inc.",
  "text": "<p>His San Francisco business touches millions of lives every day with tools that enable companies to reach consumers and workers through voice, video and chat. You use Twilio software if you text your Uber driver.</p><p>Mr. Lawson grew up in West Bloomfield, Mich., and became an entrepreneur at age 13 videotaping parties with a camera that was a bar mitzvah gift. He quit the University of Michigan midway through his senior year so he could start a company that offered college lecture notes via the internet. He sold that in 2000 and helped create two more -- StubHub Inc. and Nine Star Inc. -- before finishing his degree.</p><p>The 44-year-old prefers building businesses over amassing wealth: \"I get to introduce something to the world that didn't exist yesterday,\" he said.</p><p>During Twilio's launch, dozens of potential investors turned down Mr. Lawson and two co-founders before they raised $30,000 from their parents. The first month, revenue was $1,000; by 2021, it was $2.84 billion.</p><p>Here are four of his trusted advisers.</p><p>Charlie Bell</p><p>An executive vice president of Microsoft Corp.</p><p>The executives grew close a decade ago when Mr. Bell was at Amazon.com Inc. and Twilio was a customer of Amazon's cloud business. Mr. Lawson admired how Mr. Bell organized his small Amazon teams; Mr. Bell told him those teams communicated faster because they were less complex. Mr. Lawson then applied that approach to Twilio, where he limits teams to 10 or fewer staffers apiece. Each team defines its customers, mission and performance measures. The approach works well, the CEO said, because workers don't want \"to feel like cogs in a machine.\"</p><p>Dr. Freada Kapor Klein</p><p>A founding partner of Kapor Capital</p><p>The philanthropist, who focuses on the intersection of tech and social justice, counseled Mr. Lawson about the importance of diversity. She and her husband, computing industry pioneer Mitch Kapor, invested in Twilio in 2009. \"I reminded Jeff that baking diversity in now will turn Twilio into a talent magnet and is easier than waiting to turn around the Titanic [later],\" Dr. Klein said. Twilio now has annual training about unconscious bias, and software-engineering apprenticeships targeted at underrepresented individuals with nontraditional backgrounds.</p><p>Christopher Van Buren</p><p>Owner and CEO of Van Buren Fitness</p><p>Mr. Lawson couldn't complete a sit-up on his own during his first session with Mr. Van Buren. The trainer's approach to fitness gains led Mr. Lawson to coach Twilio colleagues differently. Mr. Lawson said he once expected associates to sink or swim without his assistance, but he switched tactics after seeing how Mr. Van Buren supported his fitness-improvement push. \"I'm here to catch you if you fall,\" Mr. Lawson said he now tells employees who fear failing tough assignments. \"Helping each other allows us to take the big steps and overreach.\"</p><p>Danny Meyer</p><p>Founder and CEO of Union Square Hospitality Group</p><p>Mr. Lawson sat down beside the restaurant operator at a 2018 conference and explained how Mr. Meyer's book, \"Setting the Table,\" had influenced him. In particular, the difference between service and hospitality. Successful service requires technical delivery of a product, according to the book, while hospitality is the degree to which a served individual \"believes you are emotionally on their side,\" Mr. Meyer said. Those ideas struck Mr. Lawson \"as equally applicable to the world of tech as to my world in restaurants,\" Mr. Meyer added.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
