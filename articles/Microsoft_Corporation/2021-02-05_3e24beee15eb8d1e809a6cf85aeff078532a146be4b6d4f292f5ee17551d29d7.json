  "title": "Best of Lex: politicians and professional services back in the game",
  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>This week saw a partial return to business as usual. Consultants were in hot water. Fundamentals dominated markets, leaving newbie traders nursing losses (admittedly, after many pocketed gargantuan gains). And politicians were marching back through the revolving doors of banks and big business.</p> <p>The latter were mostly migrants from the US corridors of power, where a new administration sent many politicians scuttling back to law firms, banks and corporations. But the UK's George Osborne, one-time chancellor and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/439d56a2-34c6-11e3-8148-00144feab7de\">champion of China ties</a>, last week dropped his post-political-portfolio career for a job at boutique investment bank Robey Warshaw.</p> <p>This is jammy work. Filings show the partnership turns every £1 of turnover into more than 80p of profit shared by partners — a pleasingly small pool. For his new role, Osborne will need to mug up on the 419-page Takeover Code and, more importantly, sweat those contacts and bring in business. Politically, his China ambitions crumbled. Robey Warshaw will be hoping his business connections are more robust. Lex calls it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/185149e3-ddbd-466d-95d2-55e32f29709b\">a calculated commercial risk</a>.</p> <p>The same could serve for other professional services, which, says Lex, are about generating as much revenue as quickly as possible. Some firms are doing nicely out of doing just that, particularly in these stricken times. Take <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aca25bd3-c656-423a-a869-4581fa71857c\">Kirkland &amp; Ellis</a>, the world's highest-grossing law firm and which is on track to generate annual revenues of $5bn for the 12 months to the end of January, a 20 per cent increase. Business is booming: M&amp;A deals are surging and there is plenty of coronavirus-related work, be it pharma companies' IP or state emergency funding packages. Still, law firms, with a cautious eye to future uncertainties, are wisely building up provisions to cushion any future blows.</p> <p>Things are a little more nuanced for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ee1d80d-d059-47e9-95ed-191a600a9909\">McKinsey</a>. The elite management consultancy has agreed a total $574m settlement with most US states and several territories over its role in helping Purdue Pharma and others sell the opioids that fuelled America's addiction crisis. McKinsey, which has not admitted wrongdoing, has updated its code of conduct. But, says Lex, “the proof of reform is a willingness to embrace principles when they reduce the bottom line”.</p> <p>Principles and market modus operandi were again at the fore as traders, many of them mobilising on Reddit and transacting on no-fee platforms such as Robinhood, took aim at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/691290bd-a2ec-4487-becc-8c8eb4c71c27\">silver</a>. Or did they? Prices of the precious metal jumped, but plenty of Redditors denied any role and the rally petered out. Good thing, reckons Lex, opining that the run was ill-timed and ill-advised.</p> <p>Either way, the flurry of recent weeks sent Robinhood off to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cca53fde-11d7-4523-bbb7-e184178e6bff\">raise $3.4bn in convertible debt</a>. The platform has already paid $65m to settle allegations that it misled users about how it makes money. This time, rather than wading into the Redditors vs hedge funds battle, Robinhood said it raised the money because clearing houses had demanded more collateral as more activity increased deposit requirements. Longer term, Lex sees an IPO providing funds.&#xa0;</p> <p>Notwithstanding regulatory and other obstacles, Robinhood — valued at $11.7bn last year — has benefited from a rush of new traders on to its platform, making it well-positioned to join public markets. Assuming, that is, Redditors do not make the platform itself a target.</p> <p>But attention spans are short — apparently <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/coronavirus/2020/05/how-focus-concentration-pandemic-brain-motivation-apps-pomodoro\">even shorter</a> during the pandemic — and towards the end of the week, the no-fee trading platform was ceding headlines to a platform older than many of the newbie traders. Amazon, having passed its quarter of a century, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8e2365a-66f7-4b60-b49a-745479206dea\">changing the guard</a>, with founder Jeff Bezos anointing Andy Jassy the new boss.</p> <p>That completes handovers among almost an entire generation of Big Tech founders/chief executives, from Google's Larry Page to Microsoft's Bill Gates. Lex expects no change to the business model under Jassy, who is both a loyal employee and successful business developer. But with growth inevitably decelerating — bigger base numbers make 50 per cent or so rates harder to sustain — and more competition, Jassy will have plenty on his plate.</p> <p>Here's hoping for clear plates for readers, and a restful weekend.</p> <p><strong>Louise Lucas</strong><br><em>Lex writer</em></p> <h2>Best of Lex articles</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/185149e3-ddbd-466d-95d2-55e32f29709b\">Robey Warshaw/George Osborne: no flannel</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aca25bd3-c656-423a-a869-4581fa71857c\">Kirkland &amp; Ellis/lawyers: strong suits</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ee1d80d-d059-47e9-95ed-191a600a9909\">McKinsey: A/B testing</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/691290bd-a2ec-4487-becc-8c8eb4c71c27\">Silver/WallStreetBets: mission creep</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cca53fde-11d7-4523-bbb7-e184178e6bff\">Robinhood: trade wars</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8e2365a-66f7-4b60-b49a-745479206dea\">Amazon/Jeff Bezos: Jassy must offer more of everything</a></p><p>Source: Louise Lucas 2021 'Best of Lex: politicians and professional services back in the game' FT.com 5 February.
