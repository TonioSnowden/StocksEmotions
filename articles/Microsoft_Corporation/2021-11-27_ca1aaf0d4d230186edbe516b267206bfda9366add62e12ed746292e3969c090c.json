  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: The Chinese Metaverse Frenzy Warps Reality --- Approach these hot stocks with caution",
  "text": "<p>It's difficult to find people who can clearly explain what exactly the metaverse will be -- roughly, a shared immersive digital realm where people can shop, interact and play -- but the concept has quickly become the hottest buzzword in the stock market. In China, the speculative craze has already caught the attention of the government. Chinese state-owned media has published a number of articles in recent weeks warning about the risks of jumping on the trend.</p><p>Even stocks only vaguely related to the metaverse have jumped in the Chinese market this year, especially after Facebook showed its commitment by changing its name to Meta Platforms last month. Shares of AVIT, which makes virtual-reality products, have almost tripled this year; those of game company Shenzhen Zhongqingbao Interaction Network have nearly quadrupled. Many companies have little concrete business and are only trying to ride the latest fad.</p><p>Some Chinese companies do stand to benefit if the metaverse takes off. Shipments of VR and augmented-reality headsets more than doubled in the second quarter this year to 2.2 million, according to market researcher IDC. That has mainly been driven by strong sales of Meta's Oculus Quest 2, launched last year. The pandemic may have given demand a push, but the device is also getting lighter and more powerful. Shenzhen-listed Goertek, which makes AirPods for Apple, is an assembler of the Oculus headset. Morgan Stanley estimates VR will contribute about a quarter of the company's revenue this year.</p><p>Meta has about three-quarters of the VR headset market, but some Chinese brands are also among those trying to catch up including DPVR and Pico, which is owned by ByteDance.</p><p>Despite the strong growth, VR is still a niche market at the moment. More staying power will depend on new and compelling uses beyond gaming. With big technology companies like Meta and Microsoft working on it, VR may have a better chance to succeed this time. But even then, it may still take many years.</p>",
