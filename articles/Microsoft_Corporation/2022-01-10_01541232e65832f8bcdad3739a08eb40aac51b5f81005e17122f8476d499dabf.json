  "text": "<p>Few doubt the vulnerability of the troves of banking data stored on the cloud. Man-made&#xa0;threats range from ransomware to systems failures. Nature could atomise information in a single solar storm such as the Carrington event of 1859. </p> <p>The UK's Prudential Regulation Authority, which oversees financial stability, is right to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29405a47-586b-4c5a-b641-0f479b4cee1d\"> take steps</a> to bolster banks on the cloud. Data storage is a systemic vulnerability just like financial risk.</p> <p>Banks have been decanting customer data from clunky mainframes to third-party data managers for a decade and more. These groups, led by Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure and Google, are typically better skilled and resourced than in-house IT departments. One lawyer likens it to leaving your passport in the hotel safe, rather than carrying it out and about.</p> <p>The counter argument is that there are only a few big cloud businesses. That means they concentrate risk. This is one reason many financial institutions have already adopted multi-cloud strategies. Rules on onshoring sensitive information also encourage this. HSBC, for example, uses Google and <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200715005162/en/AWS-HSBC-Reach-Long-Term-Strategic-Cloud-Agreement/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-bV7DTIYheT0D-1vT4_bKFzt_EW40VMdK6eG-WLfRGUE1fJraLPL1g6AeUGJlCTYs7Oafol48Kkc8KJgZoTHgMu0w8LYSbRdYOj2VdwnuKwa\">AWS</a>. </p> <p>The PRA's operational resilience framework already covers banks' use of cloud computing. A step further into the world of data storage takes the PRA a step further out of its financial wheelhouse.</p> <p>The risk of a heavy-handed approach is already evident in Europe. There, regulators' desire to coalesce fragmented legislation and level the playing field have resulted in a demanding road map that financial institutions must follow.</p> <p>The European Commission's proposed<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/documents-register/detail?ref=COM(2020)595&amp;lang=en\"> Digital Operational Resilience Act</a>, (Dora) aims to bolster financial institutions' defences against cyber attacks and other risks. Banks have to create a whole new risk management framework. European nations have also banded together over <a href=\"https://www.gaia-x.eu/news/gaia-x-association-releases-its-vision-and-strategy-document\">Gaia-X</a>, a software framework for control and governance that sits on top of existing cloud platforms.</p> <p>UK banks and financial services companies would chafe at provisions as onerous as Dora. That explains why the PRA is proposing a less prescriptive cloud charter.</p> <p>It is via such small differences that the UK will define post-Brexit financial standards, with all the opportunities for competitive advantage and extra risk that brings.</p><p>Source:  2022 'PRA/cloud data: financial regulator right to venture out of wheelhouse' FT.com 10 January.
