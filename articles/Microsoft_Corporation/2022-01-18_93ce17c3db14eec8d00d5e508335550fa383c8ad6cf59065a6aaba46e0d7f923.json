Investors are now adjusting the composition of the portfolios partly on “fear of a more aggressive Fed,” whether that proves “economically significant” or not.&#xa0;</p><p>“It's not the impact of the Fed itself,” he said. “It's the fear of what an investor thinks other investors will read into the tea leaves.”</p><p>Which companies were in focus?</p><p>In its biggest ever acquisition, MicrosoftMSFT said it would pay $95 per ActivisionATVI share to create the world's third-biggest gaming company measured by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony.
