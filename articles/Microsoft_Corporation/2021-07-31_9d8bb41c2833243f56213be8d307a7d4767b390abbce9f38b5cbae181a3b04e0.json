  "title": "Sunisa Lee Plans to Go To Auburn",
  "text": "<p>Lee will become the first American Olympic all-around champion to go on to NCAA gymnastics -- because she is the first one who doesn't have to give up the possibility of taking money for endorsements or touring, after states pushed the National Collegiate Athletic Association into overhauling its eligibility rules.</p><p>She has long been committed to attend and compete for Auburn, where the gymnastics team's head coach, Jeff Graba, is the twin brother of her coach, Jess Graba, in Little Canada, Minn.</p><p>The idea of the Olympic all-around champion following through on a college commitment, though, would have been almost unthinkable until now.</p><p>For Lee's predecessors, the value of post-Olympic opportunities gave them no choice but to forgo a scholarship and four years of competing in the fun, relaxed world of NCAA gymnastics. And some high-profile gymnasts have rolled the dice by turning professional in the run-up to the Games -- and then regretted missing out on the collegiate experience.</p><p>But Lee can do both, and post-Olympic opportunities are already coming in.</p><p>She confirmed that there had been discussions about her appearing in the exhibition Gold Over America Tour, the Simone Biles-headlined production that will hit 35 cities in the fall, and for which Lee could now be paid far more than a basic food and lodging stipend. Biles has said she would be on the bill despite the current condition that forced her withdrawal from the team and all-around finals.</p><p>Lee said she hadn't made a decision about the tour, and that it would depend on whether she could work out the times with her Auburn coaches. She wasn't ruling out anything a day after a win that was as stunning for her as anyone else, including the world championships in Japan in October, or the 2024 Games in Paris, now only three years away.</p><p>But it's college that she is certain of. She has to be at Auburn by Aug. 11, she knows her roommate already and she hopes it will still be a normal experience for her.</p><p>\"I know that I'm set on going to college because that just has been another one of my dreams,\" she said. School will let her \"get away from this elite atmosphere because it's so, like, crazy. And I know that college is going to be way better.\"</p><p>Lee can almost certainly prove wrong the fears that allowing college athletes to be compensated for the use of their name, image and likeness would largely benefit star male athletes in so-called revenue sports and hurt female athletes. She could even find that the chance to compete regularly in college gives her more exposure than a typical champion receives after the Games fade.</p><p>Lee said she wants to be careful not to risk her college eligibility no matter what the new rules are. But very little is off the table, said Michael Burwick, a Greenspoon Marder sports lawyer and licensed basketball player agent. In Alabama, Lee can look to a state law passed this year that requires schools to allow athlete endorsement rights, with only a handful of restrictions around products that a school wants to bar, such as tobacco or casinos. \"She could do anything from selling used cars in her hometown to IBM or Apple or Microsoft,\" he said.</p>",
