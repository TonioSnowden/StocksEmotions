  "title": "Businesses Hope for Legal Clarity on Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy in 2023; It's been two years since the EU's top court shot down a U.S.-EU pact on data flows due to worries over U.S. government surveillance. In 2023, a new framework is expected to offer a solution",
  "text": "<p>Member nations of the EU still have to approve the arrangement, while regulators are due to weigh in over the coming months.</p><p>The framework would replace a previous trans-Atlantic privacy agreement, the Privacy Shield, which the EU's top court invalidated in 2020 saying American government surveillance posed risks to Europeans' privacy. Since then, companies have moved data to the U.S. by using contracts with specific privacy terms that meet the EU's high standards. Still, doing so has been risky: There has been a growing volume of decisions from European data-protection regulators restricting the ways companies can move data to the U.S. and preventing them from using American technology providers.</p><p>Some regulators have declared it illegal to use such services as Alphabet Inc.'s Google Analytics, cloud security company Cloudflare Inc. and Microsoft Corp.'s Office 365 products. European companies have wondered whether they are inviting scrutiny if they use any number of popular American tech products, said Carlo Piltz, a partner at Piltz Legal, a law firm in Berlin.</p><p>In one early instance, the Austrian privacy regulator in January said a company had violated the General Data Protection Regulation, the EU's broad privacy law, by using Google Analytics—even though Google said it had applied safety guards. The regulator maintained that Google Analytics tracks the personal data of website users and transfers it to the U.S. Italian and Danish regulators later issued similar rulings.</p><p>\"There's definitely a risk of using U.S.-based services,\" Mr. Piltz said.</p><p>Since the 2020 court ruling, American tech providers have sought to reassure European customers by saying their data can be stored in the EU. Some privacy advocates, though, have challenged those arrangements, arguing that under the 2018 U.S. CLOUD Act, U.S.-based companies could still be compelled to share personal data with U.S. law enforcement.</p><p>Last year, the European Data Protection Board, the umbrella group of EU privacy regulators, said companies should use encryption and other tech tools to protect personal data if they use a cloud service that might transfer information outside the EU.</p><p>Corporate privacy officers see the coming trans-Atlantic deal as offering some way out of the current precarious legal situation.</p><p>It won't be \"a magic wand and make all these issues go away, but it absolutely will provide companies and regulators more certainty,\" said Caitlin Fennessy, vice president and chief knowledge officer of the International Association of Privacy Professionals.</p><p>In October—after EU and U.S. officials had worked on the new deal for more than a year—President Biden signed an executive order aimed at addressing the EU court's concerns on privacy, notably its objections to broad surveillance and the lack of redress options for Europeans. Now, residents of the EU can challenge the U.S. government in a newly created court if they believe they are being spied on.</p><p>Max Schrems, the Austrian lawyer who filed the legal complaint that led to the overturning of the Privacy Shield, has said the new U.S. executive order still didn't provide sufficient protections for Europeans.</p><p>Once a final EU-U.S. agreement is in place, privacy officers will have less paperwork to do as extra contract language will no longer be needed, said Marja Lubbers, data protection officer for the Belgium and Luxembourg operators of employment services firm Manpower Group. \"The administrative burden in my role definitely became a lot bigger\" after the previous privacy deal collapsed two years ago, she said.</p><p>After the 2020 court ruling, European regulators began requiring companies to provide assessments on the extent of government surveillance in countries where they store Europeans' data. Companies often need to hire lawyers in those countries to help with those write-ups, which can be difficult, Mr. Piltz said.</p><p>The EU officials who crafted the draft privacy agreement say they expect it will face legal challenges.</p><p>Once a deal is in place, companies will need to be certified to avail themselves of its protections and move data more easily.</p><p>Ms. Lubbers said she isn't sure yet if Manpower Group will sign up.</p><p>\"All the time you invest into this topic, you might wonder if it's worth it,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Catherine Stupp at catherine.stupp@wsj.com</p><p>Businesses Hope for Legal Clarity on Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy in 2023</p>",
