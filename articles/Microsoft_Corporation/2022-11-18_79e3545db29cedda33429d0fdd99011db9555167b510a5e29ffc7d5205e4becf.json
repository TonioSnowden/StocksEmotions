  "text": "<p>   Regarding your editorial \"The GOP's Lost Independents\" (Nov. 14): President Biden was criticized in conservative circles for speaking out against MAGA extremists in September and again in early November. But it was something he felt compelled to do. I believe that his courageous message resonated with many voters. Many of us are very grateful for the midterm election results. </p><p>   Mark Brady </p><p>   Dix Hills, N.Y. </p><p></p>",
