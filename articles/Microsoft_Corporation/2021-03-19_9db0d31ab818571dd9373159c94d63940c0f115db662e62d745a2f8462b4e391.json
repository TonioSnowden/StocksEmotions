  "text": "<p>Merryn Somerset Webb's article “Want a greener world? Don't dump oil stocks” (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bbe0f957-5db1-4a2e-b01c-66b4a96d84be\">Opinion</a>, FT Money, FT Weekend, March 13) states that holding fossil fuel and mining stocks is the right thing to do by the planet. </p> <p>This is at odds with the decision made by thousands of sustainable investors, including the UK's largest private pension fund (Nest), the Royal College of GPs, the University of Cambridge, and even New York City: to divest from fossil fuels. </p> <p>Even Bill Gates, previously a divestment sceptic, has now pledged to divest his holdings in oil and gas companies. </p> <p>Divestment has a tangible financial impact. In 2019, Royal Dutch Shell listed the success of divestment campaigns as having “a material adverse effect on the price of our securities and our ability to access capital markets”. </p> <p>Meanwhile, coal companies are already struggling to raise financing for their global plans. </p> <p>Fossil fuel companies are currently grossly overvalued, with most of their reserves carrying the risk of being unexploitable and turning into stranded assets. Friends of the Earth's data-driven position on divestment is premised on planetary merits and a strong financial case. </p> <p>Far from “flouncing off in a huff”, divestment is a final escalation tactic targeting companies that have been asked nicely for years to stop wrecking the planet. </p> <p>The article does show that those with vested interests in the fossil fuel industry fear the power of the divestment movement and the impact that responsible investors can have in disrupting hierarchies. </p> <p>The industry has consistently demonstrated that it is unwilling and incapable of making substantive progress towards a Paris-aligned world. As well as divesting, a key focus for the UN climate talks in Glasgow this year must be on local, national and international policies to deliver the Paris Agreement and cut fossil fuel demand. </p> <p><strong>Rianna Gargiulo</strong> <br><em>Divestment Campaigner<br>Friends of the Earth<br>London SW9, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Divestment campaigns alter the way fossil fuel groups behave' FT.com 19 March.
