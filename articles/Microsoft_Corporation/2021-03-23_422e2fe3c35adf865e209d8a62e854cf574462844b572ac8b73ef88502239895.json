  "text": "<p>Last Friday, fans started queueing from 6.30am to be the first to enter Super Nintendo World, a new theme park incorporated into Universal Studios Japan. They entered through a signature green warp pipe, rode Mario Karts, roamed the castles of Bowser and Princess Peach and competed with other visitors to collect virtual coins as the game's signature music played. This is the Japanese gaming company's grandest venture yet in its renewed effort to trade on the popularity of its&#xa0;iconic characters&#xa0;by bringing them into the physical world.</p> <p>The park, which cost $580m and took six years to develop, has been built alongside existing zones themed around Harry Potter and Jurassic Park. It was due to open last summer before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, but suffered two delays due to the pandemic. This weekend's first visitors were required to wear masks and use hand sanitiser, though the park stopped short of the advice issued by another Japanese theme park which, in the interests of reducing the spread of virus-carrying aerosols, asked rollercoaster riders to limit loud expressions of joy and instead to “please scream inside your hearts”.</p> <p>This is not the first time Mario and friends have escaped the screen into the physical world. On a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/582740ee-110e-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a\">visit</a> to Japan I saw people dressed as Nintendo characters driving dinky go-karts around the traffic-choked roads of Tokyo's gaming hub Akihabara. Brands are realising that bringing familiar gaming IPs into the real world can attract big audiences and profits. NBC just announced a game show based on the arcade classic <em>Frogger</em>, which will challenge competitors with obstacle courses that include dodging treacherous — and hopefully not real — traffic.</p> <p>The past 20 years have seen increasing attempts to create “pervasive games” which extend into the real world, blurring a game's reality with our own. One of the first experiments was <em>Majestic</em>, a 2001 “alternate reality” game which sent players clues via text, email, phone and even fax to solve a mystery. British artists Blast Theory created media projects throughout the 2000s which blended video games with live action, creating real-life experiences where players assumed roles in storylines that asked provocative questions about war, terrorism and surveillance.&#xa0;</p> <p>In 2004 a group of students at New York University developed <em>Pac-Manhattan</em>, a physical simulation of the 1980s arcade game which took the grid of streets around Washington Square park as its stage. Five people dressed as Pac-Man and his neon ghost nemeses chased each other through the neighbourhood, each communicating via walkie-talkie with a “player” in a control room who gave advice on direction and speed. During their first game, excited passers-by couldn't resist joining in, tipping off the ghosts that they had just seen Pac-Man slip away down a side-road.</p> <p>One player found <em>Pac-Manhattan </em>such a tough workout that he felt sick. It didn't take long for developers to realise that video games could be beneficial in motivating people to exercise <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85a1793d-81be-42ab-b7f8-eafbfe2e5973\">in real life</a>, perhaps best articulated in the “exergame” <em>Zombies, Run!</em> This app turns your weekly jog into a gripping story of zombie outbreak as you listen to audio narratives that urge you to run faster to outpace the brain-hungry horde, pick up supplies for base camp, and unravel mysteries which include a cameo from writer Margaret Atwood.&#xa0;</p> <p>Pervasive gaming took a huge step forward with the widespread availability of powerful smartphones that can employ augmented reality (AR), which uses a phone's screen like a lens into a magical world, showing virtual objects overlaid upon the real world, as if there really were a Pokémon sitting at the end of your garden. <em>Pokémon Go</em>, released in 2016, is by far the most popular AR game, encouraging millions to trudge around local parks and monuments daily looking for monsters. The pandemic threatened this game since it is focused on encouraging players to explore and gather outside, but canny tweaks by developer Niantic meant users could play from home instead, and the game had its most lucrative year in 2020. Such is the pull of Pokémon nostalgia that subsequent AR games based around <em>Jurassic Park</em>, <em>Harry Potter</em>, <em>Dragon Quest</em>, and <em>Minecraft </em>have been unable to match its popularity.&#xa0;</p> <p>Once, gaming had its place in bedrooms, lounges and basements. The pandemic has been a boon to the UK gaming industry, which recorded an unprecedented 30 per cent growth in the past year. Yet even when people are allowed to travel again, their games will not desert them. Screens are now ubiquitous; in our offices and our pockets, even on our wrists. New Xbox games can be picked up and played seamlessly between home consoles, laptops and mobile phones via streaming. </p> <p>Meanwhile the gaming industry's techniques for monetisation and user retention are liberally borrowed in apps we use for dating, banking and chatting. Now in the form of theme parks and multimedia art, games are moving beyond screens entirely, into the physical realm. Gaming has broken free of its traditional home under the family television. There will be no going back.</p><p>Source: Tom Faber 2021 'When games and reality blur' FT.com 23 March. Used under licence from the Financial Times. © The Financial Times Limited 2021.
