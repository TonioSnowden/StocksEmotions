  "title": "Microsoft hires former Amazon cloud exec Charlie Bell",
  "text": "<p>Charlie Bell, who left Amazon Web Services recently, is now listed by Microsoft MSFT as a corporate vice president, according to an internal employee register viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Bell was a senior vice president at Amazon Web Services, as the company's cloud-computing arm is known, and for years worked with Jassy, then the AWS boss, to build up the cloud-computing business.</p><p>Bell spent more than two decades at AWS and was widely considered an heir apparent to Jassy.&#xa0;When Jassy was named&#xa0;to replace&#xa0;Jeff Bezos&#xa0;as Amazon's AMZN CEO, the company went outside for his replacement. In March, Amazon tapped Adam Selipsky to become&#xa0;the cloud business's next chief executive.</p><p>Selipsky also had a history at AWS and close ties to Jassy. He was one of the first vice presidents hired in 2005 to work at the cloud-computing business, remaining there for about 11 years and rising to run marketing, sales, support, business development, partner alliances and international expansion. He left in 2016 to become CEO of the data-analytics platform Tableau Software Inc., which was acquired by&#xa0;Salesforce.com&#xa0;Inc. CRM&#xa0;for more than $15 billion, before his return to Amazon.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>OnlyFans suspends plan to ban sex videos.</p><p>Regulators scrutinize a Robinhood marketing ploy: free shares.</p>",
