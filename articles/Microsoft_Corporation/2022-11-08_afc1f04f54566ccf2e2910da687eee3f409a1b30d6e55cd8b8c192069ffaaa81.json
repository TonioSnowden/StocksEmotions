  "title": "Activision Scores Some Downside Protection; 'Call of Duty' makes a strong comeback and improves game maker's prospects if Microsoft deal falls through",
  "text": "<p>The news predictably didn't do much for Activision's stock on Tuesday given its still-pending acquisition by Microsoft. Perversely, the game's success might even be mixed news on that front since a stronger \"Call of Duty\" could fuel more worries about the Xbox maker eventually making the game exclusive to that platform. Sony, which makes the rival Playstation platform, has been pushing to have the deal blocked on the grounds it could lose access to the blockbuster franchise. But that has never been Microsoft's aim with the deal; Xbox Chief Executive Officer Phil Spencer told the Wall Street Journal's Tech Live conference last month that he even wants to see \"Call of Duty\" on the Nintendo Switch and be much larger in mobile—platforms that Microsoft doesn't control.</p><p>Still, worries about the deal's ultimate fate have kept a lid on Activision's stock. The shares have fetched a notable discount to the bid price since it was announced in January, and that discount has widened as regulators have stepped up their scrutiny. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority escalated its probe in September, and the European Commission announced Tuesday its own in-depth investigation into the deal. Activision shares are now trading around 25% below Microsoft's offer price of $95.</p><p>Wall Street analysts still largely expect the deal to pass. But a stronger \"Call of Duty\" puts Activision in a much better place should the transaction fail to gain the necessary approvals. The game generates about $3 billion in annual revenue between its console, free-to-play and mobile versions, according to consensus estimates at Visible Alpha. And the disappointing launch of \"Call of Duty: Vanguard\" last year—which came soon after Activision was rocked by scandals involving sexual misconduct in the workplace—was a major factor in denting the company's market value and creating an opportunity for the Microsoft deal. Clay Griffin of SVB Securities wrote Tuesday that Activision's improving performance creates a \"heads I win, tails I don't lose all that much scenario.\"</p><p>Activision is getting some of its game back.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Activision Scores Some Downside Protection</p>",
