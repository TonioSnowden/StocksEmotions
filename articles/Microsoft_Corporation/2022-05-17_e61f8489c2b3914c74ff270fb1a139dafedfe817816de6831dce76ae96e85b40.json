  "text": "<p>London-based fintech Thought Machine has doubled its valuation to $2.7bn as the cloud banking company pulls in institutional investors like Morgan Stanley and looks to expand its international presence.</p> <p>The $160mn funding round was led by Singaporean investor Temasek alongside Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo and US bank Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>Existing investors including JPMorgan Chase, Lloyds Banking Group and Swedish financial group SEB also participated.</p> <p>“This marks a long-term investment: we've left the world of venture capital,” Paul Taylor, founder and chief executive, told the Financial Times. “It's a very hot market — we can never expand quickly enough to meet demand from banks.”</p> <p>Thought Machine, launched in 2014, provides cloud-based banking infrastructure “Vault” to more than 35 banks globally, allowing them to scale up servers and processing power as needed. </p> <p>Clients range from major lenders such as Morgan Stanley, Lloyds Banking Group, JPMorgan and Standard Chartered to neobanks Atom Bank and Curve.</p> <p>Currently much of banks' core banking infrastructure remains on their premises in mainframe computers, he said. Thought Machine can replace this with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/understanding-cloud-computing\">cloud</a> servers, which reduces the need for expensive physical infrastructure. It is also easier to scale up by bringing in additional processing power from cloud data centres.</p> <p>In an earnings call in October, JPMorgan chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum said that the bank chose Thought Machine to support fast innovation and resiliency. </p> <p>The Series D round comes just months after it reached unicorn status following a $200mn round led by Nyca Partners in November. </p> <p>In addition to expanding in markets including Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia, Taylor said that the company was looking to target business and corporate banking as well as mortgages. </p> <p>“Many banks have gone beyond the life cycle on their technology — they're running out of spare parts in terms of people who know how the systems work,” he added. “There's a false confidence of ‘if we don't change everything, what can go wrong?'”</p> <p>Banks' efforts to modernise technology have become ever more important as their operations have become increasingly digitised. In a video from an internal meeting at Lloyds released in December, group transformation director Nick Williams said that its on-premises software was “not fit for purpose”. Lloyds spent more than £4bn on technology between 2018 and 2020,&#xa0; and there are no suggestions its technology is not robust, with among the lowest outage levels of major lenders.&#xa0;</p> <p>While the cloud computing market as a whole is dominated by Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft, Taylor said that there was still room for specialist fintechs.</p> <p>“You have to focus on what is key — Google has done really well on enterprise, but it can't do everything,” said Taylor, who previously worked at the Big Tech company. “There's things like payments, fraud, anti-money laundering, tonnes of stuff.”</p> <p>Taylor said that Thought Machine had a timeline for a public listing of about three years, after it has shown some years of profit and growth, and it was looking at all options for where to list. </p> <p>London was a strong contender for an initial public offering, he added. </p> <p>The UK has sought to make its market more competitive against its counterparts over the Channel and the Atlantic following Brexit, with plans for a new regulatory framework announced in the financial services and markets bill, introduced as part of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/304cf92e-1b29-4049-bab7-f6640486bca4\">Queen's Speech</a> last week.</p><p>Source: Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan in London 2022 'UK cloud banking fintech Thought Machine doubles valuation to $2.7bn' FT.com 17 May.
