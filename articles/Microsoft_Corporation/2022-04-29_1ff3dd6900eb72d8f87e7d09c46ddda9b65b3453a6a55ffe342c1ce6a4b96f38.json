  "text": "<p>An EU foreign-affairs spokeswoman, Nabila Massrali, confirmed that \"a local agent\" of the EU delegation in China has been detained since September. \"We are concerned for his well-being,\" she said.</p><p>China hasn't provided the EU with any information on the allegations or specific charges that the employee faces, despite several requests for such details from the EU, according to Ms. Massrali. \"We will continue inquiring until we get a proper answer,\" she said.</p><p>The \"picking quarrels\" allegation is typically applied to disorderly conduct, such as brawling and damaging property, but Chinese authorities have regularly used it to prosecute activists and dissidents. The offense was expanded to include online behavior in 2013 by defining the internet as a public space. Offenders can be punished with up to 10 years in prison, depending on the severity of the violation.</p><p>Mr. An had maintained a vocal presence on China's WeChat social-media platform, where he expressed candid views on politics and spoke favorably about democracy, according to the person familiar with the situation. Mr. An's WeChat account has been suspended in the past, likely as a result of his political views, the person said.</p><p>Mr. An has been working for the EU delegation as an information-technology support staffer since 2006, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p><p>EU diplomats in Beijing started looking for Mr. An after he disappeared and eventually learned that he was being held by Chinese authorities, the person familiar said.</p><p>China's Foreign Ministry didn't immediately respond to an emailed request for comment after working hours on Friday.</p><p>Mr. An's arrest was first reported by France's Le Monde newspaper, which said that the EU delegation to China sent three diplomatic notes to China's Foreign Ministry expressing concern about Mr. An and seeking information about his case, and hadn't heard back from Beijing.</p><p>Another Chinese national working for the EU delegation also ran into trouble with local authorities in the same month, according to the person familiar with the matter. This Chinese national was detained for allegedly driving under the influence, the person said.</p><p>Spokespersons for the EU delegation to China didn't reply to a request for comment sent after business hours on Friday. Ms. Massrali didn't immediately respond to a request for more comment.</p><p>Chinese nationals working for foreign diplomatic missions and news outlets are closely vetted and monitored by Beijing. Some Chinese employees at foreign media organizations have been detained in the past for alleged criminal wrongdoing.</p><p>In December 2020, Chinese authorities detained a local staff member working in the Beijing bureau of Bloomberg News on suspicion of endangering national security. Haze Fan, who was working as a producer for Bloomberg TV, has remained in custody since then.</p><p>The EU and China held a video-call summit earlier this month, where they clashed over the conflict in Ukraine and China's economic boycott of Lithuania, which began after the EU member nation increased its engagement with Taiwan, a self-governed democracy that China claims as part of its territory.</p><p>An EU official briefed on the April summit call said the issue of the detained employee wasn't raised. Ms. Massrali and the EU delegation to China didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Laurence Norman in Brussels contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Chun Han Wong at chunhan.wong@wsj.com</p><p>China Detained EU Delegation Employee in Beijing</p>",
