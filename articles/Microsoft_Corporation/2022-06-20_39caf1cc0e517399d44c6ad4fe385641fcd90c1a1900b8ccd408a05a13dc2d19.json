  "title": "Car Talk for Catholics: Priest Podcast Illuminates Topics From Annulment to Batman; Clergy members are spreading their message in audio shows like 'Clerically Speaking,' which delves into religious and secular questions of our day",
  "text": "<p>On their show, \"Clerically Speaking,\" Rev. Harrison Ayre and Rev. Anthony Sciarappa, both in their 30s, talk about vocations and answer call-in queries about confession, the soul and cloning.</p><p>They also discuss Batman movies, WrestleMania and nonfungible tokens. They bait each other with questions like, \"Who do you love more? Mary or Joseph?\"</p><p>When the priests began the podcast in 2018, their producer—Father Anthony's little brother—expected it to be short-lived. Instead, it has developed a steady following, and was even a recent contender for the best podcast in Pittsburgh.</p><p>Churches seeking to draw more and younger participants are deploying strategies ranging from livening up music to modernizing interiors.</p><p>A podcast, some clerics are finding, can be a surprisingly effective way to reach people who don't attend services.</p><p>One of the earliest priest podcasts, \"Catholic Stuff You Should Know,\" started in 2010. Two Denver seminarians decided to produce it after Pope Benedict XVI asked young people to use technology to reach other youth. The podcast has about 90,000 uploads a week.</p><p>Father Mike Schmitz in Duluth, Minn., has three podcasts, \"The Bible in a Year,\" in which he read the entire Bible in 365 days, \"The Fr. Mike Schmitz Catholic Podcast,\" which covers a new theme every week, recently offering three tips on loving those we find difficult to love, and a third based on his weekly sermons.</p><p>In \"Ask Father Josh,\" a Catholic question-and-answer podcast, Rev. Joshua Johnson in Baton Rouge, La., answers listener questions about topics such as bringing children to Mass, Stations of the Cross and altar servers.</p><p>Andrew Brueggen, youth minister at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Onalaska, Wis., wrote a blog post for a youth-ministry program ranking \"Clerically Speaking\" among the top five podcasts for people in his field.</p><p>It lets people see priests as normal people who are entertaining, have hobbies and a sense of humor, he says. \"They're a little more honest and a little more fun,\" he says. \"I love it when they talk about videogames and WWE,\" referring to World Wrestling Entertainment.</p><p>\"Clerically Speaking\"—a sort of Car Talk for Catholics—stands out for being lighthearted and personal, while also spiritual, with episodes such as \"What Makes Fr. Anthony Angry/Pizza/Sacraments.\"</p><p>Each episode starts with conversation, usually not religious. In one, Father Harrison talks about getting into nonfungible tokens and making enough money to pay off some student loans. In another, Father Anthony says he caught his pastor off guard when he asked: \"How do you feel about me putting a La-Z-Boy in our new chapel?\"</p><p>From there, they address theological emergencies called in by listeners—what to do about parents, say, who aren't Catholic and don't want their son to get married in a Catholic church—and end with deeper topics like discernment or whether there should be a theology of the internet.</p><p>Neither priest knew how to produce a podcast, so they asked Father Anthony's little brother, Nick Sciarappa, a youth minister with experience in audio, to produce it.</p><p>\"This is going to be silly. A couple of episodes and it will burn out,\" Nick recalls thinking.</p><p>When Nick's laptop screen broke, they posted a photo of it on the podcast's Twitter account and referred anyone who wanted to help to a donor page that helps raise money for the show and charity. The \"Church Lady\" level is $10 a month. \"Chreasters,\" referring to people who attend church only on the year's two big holidays, can pledge $1 a month—\"It's a start,\" the donor page declares. \"We are thankful.\"</p><p>Segments include \"Summa Tweetalogica,\" a takeoff on St. Thomas Aquinas's book \"Summa Theologica.\" During the segment, introduced by a chant that Nick sings in four-part harmony—recording over himself—they read their favorite tweets.</p><p>One tweet was from a nun responding to an online comment about nuns seeing a goth and clutching their rosaries: \"Oh please. No one is clutching a rosary because you are a goth. We're the original goths. But I'll say a rosary for you anyway.\" The nun was later a guest on the podcast.</p><p>They discuss the appeal of ketchup-flavored potato chips, a staple Canadian snack food, which Father Anthony recently discovered at a Pittsburgh convenience-store chain that offers custom made-to-go meals. \"It's a magical place,\" he says. \"I eat there all the time, I'm basically their chaplain.\"</p><p>They also share personal details. Father Anthony, a parish priest in Pittsburgh, described being treated for depression and anxiety in the seminary. \"It's important for people to understand priests as human beings,\" says Father Harrison, pastor of a parish in British Columbia.</p><p>The description of Father Anthony on the Clerically Speaking website consists of one sentence repeated 26 times: \"Anthony is cool and okay.\"</p><p>Online reviews of the podcast include \"I often catch myself singing the summatweetalogica\" and \"Priests play Xbox??? Dang. I'm old.\" A reviewer identified as a non-Catholic wrote: \"Frs. Anthony and Harrison have quickly become my two companions on my way to work…I just wanna get a beer or a cup of Joe with them!\"</p><p>Showbiz being showbiz, not all comments are perfectly heavenly. \"These guys are funny and very smart…well at least Father Harrison is smart,\" wrote one reviewer.</p><p>Father Harrison, pursuing a Ph.D. in theological anthropology, says he's more serious. \"Father Anthony is definitely funnier,\" he says. \"But we're both contrarians.\"</p><p>Taylor Schroll, 32, of Bryan, Texas, hosts his podcast \"Forte Catholic\" with the hashtag #MakeCatholicismFunAgain, and invited the \"Clerically Speaking\" priests on his show to compete in a preach-off. They had to incorporate three random words—among them cheese, moose and St. Joseph of Arimathea—into a 60-second sermon.</p><p>Father Harrison stumbled, saying he saw a \"flock of moose\" but won.</p><p>Rachal Bright, 33, of New Castle, Pa., heard about \"Clerically Speaking\" from other young moms at church and listens regularly while cooking, driving and cleaning.</p><p>It makes her laugh, she says, and inspired her to go to confession for the first time in six years.</p><p>When Father Harrison in one episode asked Father Anthony whether he loved Joseph or Mary more, Father Anthony said: \"That's not fair.\"</p><p>Father Harrison replied: \"It's totally fair, and you have to answer it.\"</p><p>Father Anthony responded that he knew more about Mary but that his admiration and love of Joseph had grown over the years, adding: \"Hopefully that is a convoluted enough answer that people won't realize what I said and will just leave me alone.\"</p><p>Write to Clare Ansberry at clare.ansberry@wsj.com</p><p>Car Talk for Catholics: Priest Podcast Illuminates Topics From Annulment to Batman</p>",
