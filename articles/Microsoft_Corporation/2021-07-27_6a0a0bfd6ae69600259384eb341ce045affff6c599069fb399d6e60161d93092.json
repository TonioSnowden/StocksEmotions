  "title": "U.S. News: Under Garland, DOJ Takes Harder Line on Antitrust",
  "text": "<p>Former Federal Trade Commission Chairman William Kovacic, a Republican, said the Justice Department challenge was \"a first important step by the new administration to contest deals more aggressively.\"</p><p>\"The prosecution of the case and the capitulation by the parties likely will cause other deal makers to reassess the regulatory risks of new transactions,\" Mr. Kovacic said.</p><p>While the investigation that led to the suit began under the Trump administration, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland has made the case a priority since taking office this year.</p><p>Allowing the two insurance rivals to merge \"would reduce that vital competition and leave American customers with fewer choices, higher prices and lower quality services,\" Mr. Garland said at the time the suit was filed.</p><p>The statement was notable for signaling Mr. Garland's personal commitment to blocking the merger, said attorney Renata Hesse, a former acting head of the Justice Department's antitrust division during the Obama administration. \"He wants to be associated with strong antitrust enforcement and here's an example of that,\" said Ms. Hesse, who is now a partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP.</p><p>Soon after joining the department, Mr. Garland met with the top attorneys in the antitrust division, according to people familiar with the matter. He promised more resources to support the division's work, these people said, and that they would be seeing much more of him in the months ahead.</p><p>\"My first love in law school was, in fact, antitrust,\" Mr. Garland said at his February confirmation hearing, adding that it was something he had taken seriously throughout his career. \"The Supreme Court has repeatedly referred to the antitrust laws as the charter of American economic liberty, and I deeply believe that.\"</p><p>Aon Chief Executive Greg Case called the Justice Department's position \"remarkably out of step with the rest of the global regulatory community.\" And the case signals what could be far-reaching changes ahead, according to NetChoice, a tech industry group that advocates for less government intrusion relating to the internet.</p><p>\"President Biden has an aggressive antitrust agenda that's far broader than simply attacking some large tech businesses,\" said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel at NetChoice. \"It's an effort to restructure the wider economy, and the halting of the Aon-Willis merger is clear evidence of that.\"</p><p>The Aon-Willis Towers deal, involving two of the largest international insurance brokerages, is the first big merger to collapse under regulatory pressure during the Biden administration.</p><p>Justice Department officials concluded that the combination would have too much clout in two markets in particular, including risk analysis and health insurance, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The two companies were willing to sell off parts of their operations, but didn't offer enough concessions to satisfy regulators, this person said.</p><p>Mr. Biden has signaled his administration would take an aggressive approach to enforcing antitrust laws through appointing senior regulators who have been critical of corporate power. He also issued an executive order this month directing further action by regulatory agencies to promote competition in a range of industries.</p><p>The executive order called on the leading antitrust enforcement agencies -- the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission -- to enforce the laws vigorously. It also laid out a policy stating that enforcement should focus on markets that have been marked by concentration in recent years.</p><p>Last week Mr. Biden named Jonathan Kanter as his pick to run the Justice Department's antitrust division. Mr. Kanter has represented Microsoft Corp. and others in legal battles with Alphabet Inc.'s Google for more than a decade. The Wall Street Journal's owner, Dow Jones &amp; Co., has been a client of Mr. Kanter in the past.</p><p>Rep. David Ciccilline (D., R.I.), who chairs the House Antitrust Subcommittee, said Mr. Kanter's hiring -- along with the abandoned insurance merger and Mr. Biden's executive order on competition -- \"demonstrates that the Biden administration is committed to enforcing the law, stopping harmful consolidation and anticompetitive conduct, and building a strong, competitive economy that works for everyone.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Brent Kendall contributed to this article.</p>",
