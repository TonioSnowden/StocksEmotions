  "text": "<p>In return, Ms. Flynn allegedly arranged in late 2017 and early 2018 for the school to admit Mr. Ridley-Thomas's son, Sebastian Ridley-Thomas, to the social work school's master's program on full scholarship and offered him a paid position as a professor.</p><p>Ms. Flynn allegedly later agreed to use the school to funnel campaign funds from Mr. Ridley-Thomas to benefit a nonprofit that his son headed. Mr. Ridley-Thomas's donation was the subject of a Los Angeles Times investigation in 2018.</p><p>The indictment identifies Sebastian Ridley-Thomas as \"MRT Relative 1,\" who served in the California Assembly from 2013 to 2017. Sebastian Ridley-Thomas, 34 years old, is the only relative of the city councilman who served in the assembly during that period.</p><p>The Indictment</p><p>* USA vs. Mark Ridley-Thomas and Marilyn Louise Flynn</p><p>Mark Ridley-Thomas, 66, and Ms. Flynn, 83, are each charged with one count of conspiracy, one count of bribery, two counts of mail fraud and 15 counts of wire fraud.</p><p>An attorney for Ms. Flynn said she \"has not committed any crime and we believe that the evidence in this case will ultimately support this conclusion.\"</p><p>Messrs. Ridley-Thomas, both Democrats, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>In a statement, the University of Southern California said it has cooperated with the investigation and will continue to do so.</p><p>The indictment is the latest in a series of scandals involving the private university. It has figured prominently in the Varsity Blues college admissions case about parents who allegedly bribed coaches and paid for fake test results to win their children admission to elite schools.</p><p>The younger Mr. Ridley-Thomas, citing health issues, stepped down from the state assembly in December 2017, around the same time he was admitted to USC. The Los Angeles Times later reported that he was facing two sexual-harassment investigations when he resigned. At the time, the indictment says, he was in tens of thousands of dollars of debt and was looking for a way to minimize public fallout for himself and his father from his sudden departure.</p><p>At the same time, USC's School of Social Work was facing a multimillion budget shortfall that \"threatened the school's viability\" and Ms. Flynn's reputation, the indictment says. According to the indictment, Ms. Flynn told university officials that she expected one of the contracts to generate $9 million a year in funding for her school.</p><p>At one point, after Ms. Flynn emailed Mr. Ridley-Thomas to request a contract amendment that would benefit the school, the politician allegedly wrote back and said, \"Your wish is my command.\"</p><p>Ms. Flynn was removed as the school's dean in June 2018, according to the indictment, and left the university that September. Her LinkedIn profile lists her as a consultant to nonprofit organizations.</p><p>Write to Christine Mai-Duc at christine.maiduc@wsj.com</p><p>Los Angeles Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, Former USC Dean Indicted</p>",
