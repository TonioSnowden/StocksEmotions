  "title": "FTC Sues to Block Microsoft's Acquisition of Activision Blizzard; Antitrust enforcer seeks to stop $75 billion deal, saying it will harm competition",
  "text": "<p>\"Microsoft has already shown that it can and will withhold content from its gaming rivals,\" said Holly Vedova, director of the FTC's bureau of competition, in a statement. \"Today we seek to stop Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio and using it to harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets.\"</p><p>In its complaint, the FTC said Microsoft previously suppressed competition from rivals through its 2021 acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc., the owner of game developer Bethesda Softworks. The agency said Microsoft made several of Bethesda's games, including \"Starfield\" and \"Redfall,\" exclusive to its own platforms, despite giving assurances to European antitrust authorities that it would do otherwise.</p><p>Additionally, the FTC said that by gaining control over Activision's blockbuster franchises, Microsoft would have \"both the means and motive\" to harm competition by changing pricing for Activision's games, degrading the quality of games on rival consoles and gaming services or withholding content from rivals entirely.</p><p>The commission vote was three to one in favor of the suit, with Republican Commissioner Christine S. Wilson voting against it.</p><p>In response to the suit, Microsoft said it continues to believe the deal would expand competition and create more opportunities for gamers and game developers.</p><p>\"We have been committed since Day One to addressing competition concerns, including by offering earlier this week proposed concessions to the FTC,\" Brad Smith, Microsoft vice chair and president, said. \"While we believed in giving peace a chance, we have complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court.\"</p><p>\"This is a somewhat meaningful setback for Microsoft,\" Stifel Nicolaus analyst Brad Reback said. \"Over the last two decades they've worked very hard to stay on the right side of government agencies.\" Mr. Reback added that if Microsoft litigates and loses, the company could become limited in its ability to do large deals in the future.</p><p>Microsoft's deal for Activision, which would be its biggest-ever acquisition, is also under investigation by antitrust regulators in the U.K andthe European Union. The companies first announced their merger agreement in January and said they expected the deal to close in June 2023.</p><p>Microsoft makes Xbox videogame consoles and competes against Sony Group Corp. and Nintendo Co., which are known for their PlayStation and Switch consoles, respectively. All three companies also develop and publish their own games.</p><p>Antitrust experts initially expected the deal would clear government scrutiny. But allegations that workplace misconduct was rampant in the past at Activision created trouble for the company in Washington—including with progressive senators who called on the FTC to thoroughly investigate the deal, along with its potential impact on workers.</p><p>The SEC has been separately investigating Activision Chief Executive Bobby Kotick and other executives over how they handled and disclosed the allegations, The Wall Street Journal has reported, citing documents and people familiar with the investigation.</p><p>\"The allegation that this deal is anti-competitive doesn't align with the facts, and we believe we'll win this challenge,\" Mr. Kotick said in a letter to employees posted on Activision's website.</p><p>Microsoft's share price rose less than 1%, while Activision's fell roughly 2% in midday trading.</p><p>The combined company would have controlled about 11% of the global digital game publication business, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analysts.</p><p>The FTC initiated a review of the Activision deal in February, the Journal reported at the time. Since assuming office in 2021, Chairwoman Lina Khan has moved to investigate more mergers, particularly those involving the largest technology companies.</p><p>Ms. Khan and other so-called progressive antitrust enforcers say competition law hasn't kept up with the evolution of the digital economy. Antitrust law historically focuses on whether mergers that combine competitors—resulting in greater market concentration—would likely drive up prices for consumers. Under the Biden administration, appointees such as Ms. Khan have pushed for focusing less on price effects and examining more vertical mergers, in which companies acquire key suppliers or partners and integrate those firms into their operations.</p><p>They have also gone after deals that don't fit easily into the horizontal or vertical categories. Ms. Khan's agency this year challenged Meta Platforms Inc.'s deal for a virtual-reality exercise game developer, Within Unlimited Inc. Meta doesn't have its own VR fitness game, but makes one of the most popular VR headsets and has an app store through which consumers purchase VR apps. The FTC's litigation over that kicked off Thursday in federal court in San Jose, Calif.</p><p>Sony has been the loudest of the critics of the planned Activision deal, arguing that it could hurt competition if Microsoft restricts access to Activision games, especially \"Call of Duty,\" due to the franchise's exceptional popularity.</p><p>Microsoft has said it doesn't plan to deny Sony and others access to Activision games and that its deal for the company wouldn't hurt competition. The company has publicly pledged to give Sony and Nintendo access to new \"Call of Duty\" games on their respective current hardware the same day they launch on Xbox consoles for the next 10 years. Though Microsoft doesn't disclose Xbox sales, it has said it would still be the third-largest videogame console maker after Sony and Nintendo after merging with Activision.</p><p>The FTC's complaint, however, points out that Activision's library of games includes more hits than just \"Call of Duty\" and that consoles may not play as big a role in the future of videogaming as they do today. New technologies and the growing popularity of subscriptions could meaningfully change that landscape, the agency said.</p><p>Microsoft is one of the world's largest cloud-computing service providers and has been a leader in the cloud-gaming market through its Game Pass subscription service. Sony offers cloud gaming through its PlayStation Plus subscription. Cloud gaming makes it possible for people to play games on just about any internet-connected device. Though the technology is in its infancy, industry analysts and executives have said it could one day make consoles obsolete.</p><p>Progressive groups have put pressure on the FTC to block the deal, saying it would create industry stovepipes in which technology companies own lucrative content and user data, and have the ability to make money from advertising as well.</p><p>\"Microsoft's recent promises not to abuse that power by making preemptive concessions to Sony and Nintendo reinforce the underlying illegality of the original deal,\" the American Economic Liberties Project's Sarah Miller said in a statement.</p><p>Write to Sarah E.
