  "text": "<p>5 Steps for Improving Collaboration Between IT and Security</p><p>The need to defend and protect vital assets and network systems grows more urgent each day. Learning these tried-and-true techniques will ensure better communication, cooperation and security results.</p><p>Get Started</p><p>Pro Cybersecurity Executive Forum</p><p>The Justice Department can't tell if its recent initiatives against ransomware groups are working because not all victims report attacks to authorities, Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General John Carlin said at the WSJ Pro Cybersecurity Forum on Wednesday. Earlier this year, the department launched a number of initiatives to tackle ransomware gangs, and announced new rules for federal contractors, but the lack of complete data from victims makes it impossible to know if those efforts have had an effect on the number of attacks. \"We're not there right now,\" he said. Read the full story.</p><p>Authorities want to know about cyberattacks sooner rather than later. The Secret Service seized around $2 billion in the last five years and prevented the loss of around four or five times that amount, James Murray, the agency's director, said at the conference. Authorities can return money to victims much more quickly if they find out about an attack early and stop the theft. One company reported a business email compromise attack last Wednesday. By Friday, the money was frozen and on its way back to the victim, he said. \"A lot of times we're not able to seize the money because it's gone because of the delay in letting law enforcement know,\" he added.</p><p>Tech supply chain security is a big concern for many companies. SolarWinds President and CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna said it would have been irresponsible if the company hadn't publicly reported details about the major hack it suffered last December. \"A lot of people ask me why SolarWinds and why Microsoft in some cases. I like to describe it as the price you pay for ubiquity so to speak, meaning you're deployed in a very large number of organizations and if you can be penetrated and potentially with admin privileges, then the possibility to laterally move in the organization increases,\" Mr. Ramakrishna said.</p><p>Even a low-value contract with a small vendor can pose a major security risk to a company, said Jerry Perullo, chief information security officer at Intercontinental Exchange. \"There's a real asymmetry between the contract when it comes to cybersecurity and the value of risk,\" he said. Limiting liability in contracts isn't going to make a vendor more secure. The way for a CISO to have assurance that a vendor has strong security measures is to commission third-party penetration testing, he added.</p><p>Quotes From The Conference</p><p>\"There is a risk, whether it's the Treasury Department or Congress or whomever, of overregulating in this space because what happens is you force these people to not use those spaces that are out there. It makes them harder to detect.\"</p><p>James Murray, Director, U.S. Secret Service, on efforts to impose new rules on cryptocurrency exchanges</p><p>\"We boiled it down to three possibilities: a spearphishing attack, a password-spraying attack or a zero-day vulnerability. If you were to ask me without knowing anything what was my first guess, my first guess was a targeted spearphishing attack. But there's no way to confirm it.\"</p><p>Sudhakar Ramakrishna, President and CEO, SolarWinds Corp., on how hackers penetrated his company</p><p>\"Even if my CFO said â€˜Hey, here's $50 million, go hire all the people you want,' it's very challenging to get those qualified people. You kind of have a very difficult perfect storm situation where existing resources are more and more stressed out, the threat level is increasing and it's hard to resource the problem away.\"</p><p>Joey Johnson, CISO, Premise Health</p><p>\"What happens is, I think there's a figure that's less than a million or maybe even millions, there's no investigation that happens. There is an investigation happening in our case right now and that's because I don't take no for an answer, quite frankly, because to me $650,000 is real money.\"</p><p>Sherry Williams, Executive Director, One Treasure Island, on getting law enforcement's help with a business email compromise attack</p>",
