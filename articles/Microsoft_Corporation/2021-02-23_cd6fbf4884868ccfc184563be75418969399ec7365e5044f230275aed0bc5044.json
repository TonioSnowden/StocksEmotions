  "title": "Business News:  Bid of $5.3 Billion to Create  Global Security-Services Firm  ----  By Ben Dummett",
  "text": "<p>   Allied Universal is set to win the bidding war for U.K. rival G4S PLC in a deal that would create a private security-services giant with global reach. </p><p>   Closely held Allied, backed by private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC and Canadian pension fund Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, moved into pole position after rival Garda World Security Corp., a Canada-headquartered security firm majority owned by asset-management firm BC Partners, decided not to raise its bid. </p><p>   Allied would pay GBP 3.8 billion, equivalent to $5.3 billion, to acquire G4S, whose half-a-million employees specialize in guarding events and infrastructure, among other businesses. </p><p>   The two sides had been scheduled to settle the standoff this week in a rare bidding auction held by U.K. regulators. However, in a surprise move Monday, GardaWorld said it wouldn't raise its current offer of GBP 2.35 a share. That leaves Allied's bid of GBP 2.45 a share as the highest. </p><p>   \"There are better and less risky opportunities available to GardaWorld,\" the company said. An Allied spokesman declined to comment, as did a G4S spokesman. </p><p>   G4S has struggled over the years with inconsistent earnings growth and reputational hits. Those date to 2012 when it botched a contract to supply 10,000 security guards for the London 2012 Olympic Games, forcing the U.K. government to draft in British soldiers and police personnel to help out. More recently, one of G4S's subsidiaries in July agreed to pay GBP 38.5 million in the UK. to resolve allegations of procurement fraud. </p><p>   Allied's operations comprise more than 265,000 security guards, and remote video and alarm systems that protect sites across industries ranging from petrochemicals to retail in the U.S., Mexico and the U.K. The G4S acquisition would strengthen Allied's existing operations in the U.S. and the U.K., while extending its reach into markets in continental Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It would also more than double Allied's annual revenue to $20 billion, based on the GBP 7.8 billion that G4S generated in 2019. </p><p>   The deal is a big bite for Allied to integrate. It would inherit G4S's bigger workforce of 558,000 employees, as well as operations in about 85 countries stretching across six continents. Allied's integration plan includes eliminating costs to support G4S's public listing and other administrative functions. However, bigger cuts won't be decided on until the deal is done, Allied has said. </p><p>   Private-equity firms like the ones bidding for G4S are sitting on mountains of cash, bidding up the value of companies hard hit by the pandemic and operational woes. </p><p>   This month a bidding war for Signature Aviation PLC ended after Blackstone Group Inc., Bill Gates's Cascade Investment PLC and Global Infrastructure Partners teamed up to acquire the U.K.-based private-jet service provider for $4.7 billion. Meanwhile, buyout firms TDR Capital LLP and I Squared Capital LLC are in talks to buy the U.K.'s Aggreko PLC, a power-generation equipment supplier, for about $3.1 billion. </p><p></p>",
