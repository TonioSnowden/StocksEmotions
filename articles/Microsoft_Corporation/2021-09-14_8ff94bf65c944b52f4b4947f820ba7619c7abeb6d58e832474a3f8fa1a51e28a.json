  "text": "<p>\"I'm a little worried that the attention to pandemic preparedness is lower than I would have expected,\" the billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft Corp. co-founder said in an interview. He said that proper preparedness included the ability to make a vaccine in 100 days and manufacture enough for the entire world in the next 100 days after that.</p><p>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation called in a report published Monday for nations to invest more in health systems, including the capacity to manufacture vaccines. The tools to end the pandemic are largely the same as those used to fight other infectious diseases, the report said: widespread testing, treatment and immunization.</p><p>Some 49 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine were administered in the first half of this year in Africa compared with 43 million in California, according to the report, highlighting inequity in vaccine availability between low-income and wealthy nations.</p><p>\"The only real solution to this problem is to have factories that can make enough for the entire world in 100 days,\" said Mr. Gates. \"And that is doable.\"</p><p>A new $65 billion plan by the Biden administration to strengthen pandemic preparedness is a step in the right direction, he said, but will have to be funded. \"We're going to have to keep pushing for that,\" said Mr. Gates, who is co-chair of the foundation with his former wife, Melinda French Gates.</p><p>Mr. Gates and Ms. French Gates, whose divorce was completed in August, remain co-chairs of their foundation. The two have an agreement that Ms. French Gates could depart after two years, if they decide they can no longer work together.</p><p>Mr. Gates said he is as engaged in his work with the foundation as ever because of the pandemic and other pressing challenges. \"It's a very positive part of our life and back to being the primary focus of my work,\" said Mr. Gates, who also works on reducing climate change.</p><p>The Gates Foundation, a family charitable trust, has said it plans to add more trustees to enhance governance and independence. Mr. Gates and Ms. French Gates are its sole trustees after Warren Buffett resigned.</p><p>Mr. Gates said that he, Ms. French Gates and the foundation's chief executive officer, Mark Suzman, plan to identify new trustees by the end of the year. He wouldn't say how many new trustees might be named. \"\"We won't have as large a board as some people have,\" he said.</p><p>He also said the foundation wouldn't change its focus on topics including health and agriculture globally as well as education in the U.S.</p><p>\"It will be nice to have additional trustees, but I wouldn't think that in terms of what we actually do that you'll see much in the way of change,\" he said.</p><p>The Gates Foundation's \"Goalkeepers\" report tracks progress toward sustainable development goals set by the United Nations. The report also looked at the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The pandemic resulted in 31.3 million more people ending 2020 in extreme poverty, the report found, and an economic recovery under way this year is leaving women behind.</p><p>Women are expected to hold 13 million fewer jobs this year than they did in 2019, before the pandemic began, while employment among men is forecast to recover largely to pre-pandemic rates, according to the report.</p><p>The pandemic didn't damage the global economy or some developmental measures as badly as the foundation anticipated. \"It wasn't the worst case, but it's still a huge setback,\" Mr. Gates said.</p><p>The percentage of children globally who are fully vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis has fallen back to 2005 levels, according to the report. The Gates Foundation uses that rate as a measure of vaccination overall against childhood diseases.</p><p>Most of the 33.9 million people who fell into extreme poverty in 2020—defined by the World Bank as living on less than $1.90 per person a day—live in sub-Saharan Africa. There were also about 2.6 million people in Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and other regions who rose above the extreme poverty line, yielding the 31.3 million total.</p><p>While data from the report show that the percentage of the global population living in extreme poverty will likely decline this year compared with 2020, Mr. Gates said he is concerned that the economic recovery is uneven world-wide. \"The scary thing is that whenever there's trouble in rich countries they have a tendency to turn inward,\" he said. \"I am worried going forward about the debt levels of the low-income countries and the global outlook.\"</p><p>Per capita income levels are expected to return to pre-pandemic levels in 90% of advanced nations by 2022 but only a third of low- and middle-income countries, according to the report. Nearly 700 million people are projected to remain in extreme poverty in 2030, it said.</p><p>Write to Betsy McKay at betsy.mckay+1@wsj.com</p><p>Bill Gates Says We Aren't Ready for the Next Pandemic</p>",
