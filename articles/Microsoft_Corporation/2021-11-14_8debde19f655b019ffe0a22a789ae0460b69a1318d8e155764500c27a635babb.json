  "title": "COP26 Opens Path to International Carbon Trading; A U.N.-certified carbon credit could be used by regulated markets and standardize more informal ones",
  "text": "<p>The carbon-trading agreement, while narrower in scope, provides businesses with one of the most concrete outcomes of the conference, called COP26. Governments from almost all of the world's countries endorsed a set of preliminary rules over how governments and companies can create, value and swap credits to drive their net emissions lower in a global trading system.</p><p>\"It is unquestionably good news that an agreement has been reached that allows everyone to move forward,\" said Thomas Lingard, global climate and environment director at Unilever PLC.</p><p>Supporters say the broader Glasgow deal—struck Saturday evening after two weeks of negotiations—signals new determination among the world's governments to shift away from burning fossil fuels, the main source of greenhouse gases that scientists say are causing the earth to warm. The agreement, though, features weaknesses that have hamstrung U.N. climate talks over the decades.</p><p>It has no enforcement mechanism, relying instead on the good faith of the world's governments to adhere to its rules as best they can. In key areas, it doesn't require nations to act, but merely urges or requests them to do so, reflecting wiggle room that was needed to achieve consensus among all governments.</p><p>U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres reflected the disappointment of many delegates in not getting more concrete commitments through a process that required signoff from almost all of the world's governments.</p><p>\"The approved texts are a compromise,\" he said. \"They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today.\"</p><p>The broader deal asks governments to strengthen their emissions-reduction targets by the end of next year to keep them in line with what scientists think is necessary to meet the climate target of the 2015 Paris accord: keeping global warming well under 2 degrees Celsius, and close to 1.5 degrees, by the end of the century, compared with preindustrial-era temperatures.</p><p>Governments had failed to agree to cuts sufficient to hit that target ahead of the summit. The review next year was seen by delegates who pushed it as a way of wringing fresh cuts from some countries in the near future.</p><p>Hours after nations approved it, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry underscored the deal's fundamental weakness: He said the U.S., the world's second-largest emitter, was unlikely to speed up its own reduction plan in a year's time, arguing that it goes far enough. \"The language is 'as necessary,' and I don't expect it's going to be necessary,\" he said.</p><p>Part of the narrower, carbon-trading agreement is aimed at creating a U.N.-certified credit that can be accounted for around the world. A standardized credit should allow governments to access regulated and more informal carbon markets that already exist and are used widely by companies. A government that can't meet the emissions plans it submitted to the U.N. could buy credits in these markets to make up the difference.</p><p>\"The rules help to define the framework for how governments can use the private sector to support them in meeting their climate targets,\" said Enric Arderiu Serra, head of environmental products at trading giant Mercuria Energy Trading SA.</p><p>Uncertainties around carbon accounting have slowed the expansion of these markets, said Dirk Forrister, president of the International Emissions Trading Association, a trade group. \"The Glasgow market framework can unleash a whole new wave of investment as companies leverage the trading tools,\" he said.</p><p>The rules are part of what has been called Article 6 of the Paris accord, which was signed in 2015. Ever since, governments have squabbled over them. A deal has faltered in past summits, amid fighting about what could be considered double-counting of the same credit by countries. Another stumbling block has been whether to allow countries to use older credits, from a now-defunct earlier trading system.</p><p>A global carbon market won't happen overnight. The agreement first invites nominations for a supervisory body to oversee the marketplace. Once that body is selected, it is slated to meet at least twice next year to develop the technical methodologies, registration and monitoring processes needed.</p><p>Currently, there is a patchwork of carbon markets globally. These include markets that are set up and regulated by governments, such as the European Union's Emissions Trading System and similar markets in China and California. In these markets, heavy-emitting industries such as utilities are given limits for how much carbon they can emit. If they stay under that limit, they can sell the extra to others who are emitting more than their ceiling. The new rules could lead to the linking up of regional emissions-trading schemes.</p><p>Parallel to these regulated markets are more informal carbon-offset markets, where companies participate voluntarily in activities such as planting trees and restoring peatlands, or funding others to do so. These projects generate credits that can be traded among companies to drive down their own net emissions—something regulators, investors and consumers are increasingly calling for.</p><p>Many companies already buy carbon-offset credits, including Microsoft Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Nestlé SA. These offset credits can be certified by third parties who record the projects and credits and confirm they meet certain standards.</p><p>The U.N. plan would provide a framework to harmonize all of these markets under generally accepted standards, for instance, about what sort of projects qualify for credits and how much carbon they offset. Critics of the informal markets that many companies use complain they aren't consistent in terms of standards.</p><p>Microsoft, noting the inconsistency of how offsets are verified, last year developed its own due-diligence process to ascertain that credits it was trading were of a certain standard.</p><p>\"At its best, Article 6 has the potential to be an important driver of carbon finance, clean energy, and carbon removal,\" said Elizabeth Willmott, carbon program director at Microsoft.</p><p>Timothy Puko and Sha Hua contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Sarah McFarlane at sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com and Matthew Dalton at Matthew.Dalton@wsj.com</p><p>COP26 Opens Path to International Carbon Trading</p>",
