  "text": "<p>Mr. Musk's wealth is more than double that of Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, according to the Bloomberg index. Establishing the exact net worth of the world's wealthiest can be tricky, in part because many of their holdings are private.</p><p>Mr. Musk's individual wealth is currently higher than the market values of all but 21 of the companies in the S&amp;P 500, according to Dow Jones Market Data as of Wednesday morning.</p><p>As Mr. Musk's net worth has risen, he has also been critical of the proposed new capital-gains tax in President Biden's social-spending and climate-change legislation. The plan would represent a tax on billionaires' unrealized gains, meaning they'd be taxed on the rising value of assets regardless of whether they were sold or not. This would effectively eliminate billionaires' ability to defer capital-gains taxes indefinitely.</p><p>\"Eventually, they run out of other people's money and then they come for you,\" Mr. Musk wrote on Twitter earlier this week, responding to another Twitter user suggesting that any new unrealized capital gains taxes will eventually hurt middle class retirement investments. Proponents say the proposal, if implemented, would likely generate a large chunk of revenue from the wealthiest taxpayers, many of whom currently can keep their reported income and tax bills low.</p><p>The climb in Mr. Musk's net worth comes after Tesla's market capitalization on Monday topped $1 trillion for the first time. Car-rental company Hertz Global Holdings Inc. said it ordered 100,000 of Tesla's electric vehicles, prompting Tesla shares to jump 13% that day.</p><p>Tesla is one of only five U.S. companies currently with a market value of more than $1 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>In addition to Tesla, Mr. Musk is co-founder and chief executive of privately held space-exploration company SpaceX, which last month launched four civilians into space. SpaceX had a valuation close to $100 billion earlier this year.</p><p>SpaceX and Mr. Musk both own bitcoin, he has said.</p><p>He previously cofounded the online-payments company that later became PayPal. Online marketplace eBay Inc. bought PayPal for $1.4 billion, and Mr. Musk made over $100 million from the deal.</p><p>Mr. Musk accumulated $117 billion of his wealth this year alone, according to Bloomberg's index. The net worth of Mr. Bezos climbed by $5.2 billion since the start of the year.</p><p>Both Amazon and Tesla didn't respond to emails seeking comments from Messrs. Bezos and Musk.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
