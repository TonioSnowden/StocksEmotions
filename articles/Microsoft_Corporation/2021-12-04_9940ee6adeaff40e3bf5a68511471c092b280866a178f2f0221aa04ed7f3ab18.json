  "text": "<p>\n  Twitter inc. </p><p>\n  TWTR -2.7% </p><p>\n  Twitter's CEO flew the coop. The social-media company said Monday that Jack Dorsey is stepping down and Chief Technology Officer Parag Agrawal would take the reins immediately. The Wall Street Journal reported that the departure was driven in part by investors who were uncomfortable with his roles running two large, publicly traded companies. He was in charge of Twitter and digital payments firm Square Inc. Last year activist investor Elliott Management Corp. pushed for changes at Twitter, including potentially adjusting Mr. Dorsey's role. Twitter shares lost 2.7% Monday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  MICROSOFT CORP. </p><p>\n  MSFT -1.8% </p><p>\n  Microsoft investors want more transparency on harassment. Shareholders on Tuesday voted to approve an investor proposal demanding the company provide greater disclosure of sexual harassment cases, including an annual report summarizing the number of cases as well as any independent investigations into Microsoft executives. The Wall Street Journal reported this year that Microsoft directors pursued an investigation into a prior romantic relationship between co-founder Bill Gates and a female staffer. Mr. Gates stepped down from the board last year. Microsoft shares lost 1.8% Tuesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  EXXON MOBIL CORP. </p><p>\n  XOM -0.1% </p><p>\n  Exxon is powering down its spending over the next five years. The Wednesday announcement from the energy giant coincides with a murky outlook for oil and gas demand, persistent economic risks from Covid-19 and efforts by some countries to wean themselves from fossil fuels. The company said it will maintain lower capital investment levels through 2027, spending between $20 billion and $25 billion a year. Exxon's plans, months in the making, reflect uncertainty about commodity markets as the world attempts to move past Covid-19. Exxon shares ended 0.1% lower Wednesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  AT&amp;T INC. </p><p>\n  T -2.6% </p><p>\n  One of CNN's biggest stars lost his prime-time spotlight. On Tuesday the network said it suspended anchor Chris Cuomo indefinitely after records released by the New York attorney general's office revealed efforts to help his brother, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, respond to allegations of sexual misconduct. The records showed that Chris Cuomo gave detailed feedback on his brother's statements to the press. The suspension comes as CNN parent company AT&amp;T prepares to merge media assets with those owned by Discovery Inc. AT&amp;T shares fell 2.6% Wednesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  SALESFORCE.COM INC. </p><p>\n  CRM -12% </p><p>\n  Salesforce is sticking by its sales goal. The business-software company on Tuesday reiterated its target of surpassing $30 billion in annual revenue in the next fiscal year, despite issuing a muted revenue outlook that fell short of expectations. Salesforce offers cloud-based software that became widely adopted during the pandemic, as businesses adapted to remote work. The company also named Bret Taylor, the company's president and chief operating officer, as co-CEO to work alongside longtime chief Marc Benioff. Salesforce.com lost 12% Wednesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  KROGER CO. </p><p>\n  KR +11% </p><p>\n  Consumers still have an appetite for dining at home. Kroger reported strong sales for the latest quarter as shoppers continued to opt for home-cooked meals. However, the Cincinnati-based grocer said higher supply-chain costs are squeezing its profits as it tries to keep shelves stocked. As products get more expensive, Kroger said consumers are becoming price-sensitive. The company said it is passing costs to customers where possible and is choosing to hold down prices in certain areas. Kroger shares gained 11% Thursday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  MODERNA INC. </p><p>\n  MRNA +12% </p><p>\n  Omicron may give vaccine makers a shot in the arm. The prospect of new demand for booster shots -- as well as medicines to treat disease caused by the new strain of Covid-19 -- lifted the stock prices of Moderna and Pfizer Inc. Moderna said it is testing whether its Covid vaccine is effective against the Omicron variant, while developing a modified vaccine that specifically targets the variant. Moderna shares soared 12% Monday. </p><p></p>",
