  "text": "<h2>‘How Big-Tech Barons Smash Innovation — and How to Strike Back', by Ariel Ezrachi and Maurice E Stucke</h2> <p>There is no shortage of competition when it comes to books tackling the issue of Big Tech monopolies. How <em>Big-Tech Barons Smash Innovation — and How to Strike Back</em> is another one, yes, but one that finds its niche in taking aim at one of the core defences of Silicon Valley, that regulation — or the “wrong” regulation, as the companies would have it — would stifle American innovation. (And if you do that, China wins.) </p> <p>Ezrachi and Stucke — two acclaimed academics, one on each side of the Atlantic — make the case that the Tech Barons have for years offered up an irresistible “ideological platter” to legislators that allows them to justify not taking a harder stance against monopolisation in tech. The book focuses on the Gafam group — Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Microsoft. The platter, a glorious feast, is laid out in front of lawmakers via these companies directly, but also opaquely-funded think-tanks, academics and other bought and paid for commentators. </p> <p>The main course is that Big Tech's huge profits have a direct line to vast innovations — the smartphone, GPS, self-driving cars — when actually, the authors outline, that money is typically spent on “innovations” and “disruptions” that cement power and kill off competition. Some of the book retreads old ground in this debate: failings of current legislation and the decades-long reluctance from regulators to enforce existing laws. But the conversation is moved on considerably with an urgent argument that legislators must act now to shift their attention from past offences to instead taking on what is coming down the track. </p> <p>This “duck hunting” approach — shooting where the duck is heading, not where it is — seems smart when considering the use of personal data to power new models of advertising, something yet to register in the antitrust debate. </p> <p>The book encourages more flexible laws that can adapt with the same guile as Big Tech's efforts to undermine them, enabling “tech pirates”, the up and coming innovators, to flourish where before they would be squashed. In all, it is a strong argument that deserves a good hearing: far from chilling innovation, the book concludes, reining in Big Tech may be the only way to save it.</p> <h2>‘Building a Second Brain: A Proven Method to Organize Your Digital Life and Unlock Your Creative Potential', by Tiago Forte</h2> <p>Do you find you wake up in the morning with your brain swimming with thoughts and you don't know where to put them? Or you have an idea, or several ideas and later on have completely forgotten them? </p> <p><em>Building a Second Brain</em> provides a possible solution to storing and later utilising these somewhat messy nuggets. We are subject to a daily information overload, so Tiago Forte has over many years tried and tested ways to help decide what kinds of information are worth preserving when we don't know how we might put it to use — whether it be at work or other areas of our lives.</p> <p>Here he lays out a detailed approach to using digital tools to feel less bombarded and have more time to think. “To properly take advantage of the power of a second brain,” he says, “we need a new relationship to information, to technology, and even to ourselves.”</p> <p>One of the first steps is to pick a note-taking app that best suits the way you want to organise your thoughts — bearing in mind that your note-taking doesn't have to be perfect, notes are just that, notes. And these “notes” can include everything from useful quotes scanned from a book, to images and half baked ideas that may come to you at random times.</p> <p>Forte argues that over time you'll develop four “essential capabilities”, which include revealing new patterns between ideas and honing the new perspectives you discover among them.</p> <p>Chapters guide the reader through the “Code” — capture, organise, distil and express — and conclude with insights into essential digital organising habits. However, the book can, ironically, feel a little overwhelming. So it's best to build your note-taking capabilities a little at a time or cherry pick the bits that work best for you.</p> <h2>‘The Model Black: How Black British Leaders Succeed in Organisations and Why It Matters', by Barbara Banda&#xa0;</h2> <p>“To be quite honest with you, Barbara, girls like you . . . don't go to Oxford.” Leadership consultant Barbara Banda — who has a PhD from that university — quotes a teacher as evidence of the barriers black professionals encounter from an early age. </p> <p>Aimed at “anyone who wants to understand what being more inclusive at work means”, <em>The Model Black </em>is a timely exploration of race in the workplace and what black employees can do to advance their careers. </p> <p>Drawing on interviews with about 30 Black British leaders in the public and private sectors, the book is divided into three parts. The most important is the second, where Banda introduces her concept of “The Model Black”: someone who, among other traits, “knows how to respond to white fragility” — a contested term borrowed from US sociologist Robin DiAngelo to refer to the <a href=\"https://libjournal.uncg.edu/ijcp/article/viewFile/249/116\">“defensive moves”</a> many white people make when challenged about racism — and “accepts they have to perform better to be equal”.</p> <p>Questions at the end of each section enable reflection — such as “How do you see the pace of change at your organisation in relation to the inclusion of black workers?” and “How do you respond when you see or hear unacceptable behaviour in your workplace?”</p> <p>The book concludes on an optimistic note, where the author speaks to young professionals who identify with “The Model Black” but hope to move beyond it. As one says: “I want you to see the blackness, but I don't want you to see only the blackness. I want you to see me.”</p> <h2>‘7 Rules of Power: Surprising — but True — Advice on How to Get Things Done and Advance Your Career', by Jeffrey Pfeffer</h2> <p>Ever since the 19th-century English historian Lord John Dalberg-Acton wrote “power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely”, power has had a mixed reputation. </p> <p>In <em>7 Rules of Power </em>Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organisational behaviour at Stanford University, is quick to acknowledge that it can be used for ill. Yet his third book on the subject argues that power — when understood properly and applied to good effect — can be the catalyst for a greater sense of job satisfaction and career development. </p> <p>Pfeffer's key contention is that, since forms of power are constantly in play in the workplace, it is to a worker's advantage to “understand the everyday dynamics . . . of organizations”. Hence his seven tenets: “Get out of your own way”, “Break the rules”, “Appear powerful”, “Build a powerful brand”, “Network relentlessly”, “Use your power” and, most importantly, “Success excuses almost everything you may have done to acquire power”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Chapter by chapter, Pfeffer cites the work of other researchers and introduces real-world case studies that neatly exemplify his arguments. Whatever their age, sector and goals, <em>7 Rules of Power</em> persuasively makes the case for all employees to better harness power in order to influence their professional trajectories.</p> <h2>‘Direct: The Rise of the Middleman Economy and The Power of Going to the Source', by Kathryn Judge</h2> <p>Many have come to rely on middlemen. Amazon and Walmart are just two examples Kathryn Judge draws on in this book, detailing how they give consumers access to lower-priced food and other goods. But they also use these benefits to make consumers actually buy stuff they do not need while also building significant power within the US economy.</p> <p>The things that make middlemen so useful “also enable them to serve their own ends at the expense of the rest of us”, Judge writes. As a law professor at Columbia University, the author has studied the middleman economy for more than a decade and here dissects how it operates in the US — from retailers to estate agents and banks — and why people need to change habits and, where possible, start to go “direct”. </p> <p>Judge knows that breaking a reliance on a huge supermarket on your doorstep is not easy and acknowledges “conflicted shoppers” who would like to rely on Amazon less but often find the service is the only one that serves their needs (which, she points out, is what gives these behemoths their power).</p> <p>Her analysis of the middleman economy reveals its dark sides, such as fragile supply chains and the pressure on suppliers to provide products at ever lower prices. But Judge recognises the limitations of going “direct”: she highlights that some direct-to-consumer brands may not in reality live up to the positive image they cultivate or stick to the values on which they were originally founded. </p> <p>Judge argues that modest shifts towards direct exchange can contribute to a more resilient economy, but she also provides guidance about how to choose a middleman more carefully when it is necessary to use one.</p><p>Source: Dave Lee, Franklin Nelson and Janina Conboye 2022 'FT business books: what to read this month' FT.com 15 June.
