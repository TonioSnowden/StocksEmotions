  "text": "<p>AT TIMES, being a gamer can feel like participating in a collective delusion about reasonable ways to spend money. New consoles are, simply put, ludicrously expensive. The MSRP of a new PlayStation 5, for instance, is $500, but stock is so limited you'll struggle to find one listed for less than $800. The games can gouge your credit card too. You'll pay $60 for many of the most well-regarded titles, including \"Elden Ring,\" \"Metroid Dread\" and \"Psychonauts 2.\" But in recent years, a lot of game developers have adopted a pricing model that lets basically anyone participate. In fact, many of the most popular games are now \"free-to-play.\"</p><p>These kinds of games, which usually cost nothing to download and play but offer options for players to spend money on things like extra characters, new levels, and cosmetic upgrades, are nothing new. Carly Kocurek, a professor of digital humanities and media studies at Illinois Institute of Technology, says \"free-to-play\" video games have a longer history than most people realize, tracing back to \"Furcadia\" in 1996, \"Achaea, Dreams of Divine Lands\" in 1997 and \"Neopets\" in 1999. \"There's a lot of casual games that use this model,\" she said. \"The first version of 'FarmVille,' launched in 2009, relied on it.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's your favorite free game? Join the conversation below.</p><p>More competitive free-to-play games came later. Christopher Paul, a professor in the Communication and Media Department at Seattle University and author of \"Free-to-Play\" (The MIT Press, 2020), says \"League of Legends,\" released in 2009 by California-based Riot Games, was one of the first. \"It's not often talked about as a free-to-play game, but Riot used sales of cosmetic items to make a whole lot of money,\" he said. The basically negligible cost of entry allowed the game to spread widely. By 2014, Riot said the game had 27 million daily players, far more than any other title at the time.</p><p>As gaming itself has gotten more popular—estimates from Insider Intelligence say more than half the U.S. population will identify themselves as video gamers by the end of the year—the options for free-to-play gamers have become more robust. You can play online battle arena games like \"Legends,\" \"Hunger Games\"-style battle royales like \"Fortnite\" or mobile-only games like \"Animal Restaurant\" without paying a cent. Even the new releases from established franchises like \"Halo,\" whose first title helped launch and establish Microsoft's Xbox, have free-to-play options. All this choice can be a bit paralyzing, especially if you've never played anything beyond Dots, but it's evidence there's basically no better time to get into video games than right now. Here, six video games that'll cost you nothing to download.</p><p>'Teamfight Tactics'</p><p>Auto-chess games like \"Teamfight Tactics\" give you the rare opportunity to rewrite the traumas that come from being picked last in elementary school dodgeball. You play each match against seven other players, taking turns to draft \"pieces\" (odd little creatures with names like Draven and Fiddlesticks) from the same pool of \"champions.\" Over seven rounds, your team will challenge those assembled by your opponents. The genius of the genre: Battles are automated. As long as you have the better team, you win the round. This makes the matches relatively short—you can draft and play seven full rounds in about 35 minutes—and encourages you to try new strategies.</p><p>'Hearthstone'</p><p>This digital collectible card game has remained extremely popular since it was initially released in 2014. That's because every few months, the team at Blizzard Entertainment releases a new set of cards. You can pay for access to as many of these cards as you want, but after you play through the tutorial and some single-player adventure modes, you'll get free starter decks. The game usually pairs you with players of a similar experience and ability level, so in your first games, you'll likely take on other players slinging those free decks, with few changes. That way, before you're thrown into a match against a Twitch streamer, you'll be able to grasp the rhythm of the game.</p><p>'Splitgate'</p><p>First-person shooters often seem interchangeable. \"Splitgate\" offers a clever twist. Beyond equipping you with the usual suite of pistols, shotguns and rifles, the game lets you shoot portals. High-jinks ensue. Place a portal around a corner to flank an enemy. Aim a portal directly behind a rival and shoot him through it. Drop one into the bottom of a chasm and use the momentum from your fall to launch yourself across the map. Place one on the ceiling directly above you, then one on the floor below you to create an infinite falling loop. Not all of these applications will make you better at the game. But the wrinkles make \"Splitgate\" extremely fun to play, even when you aren't winning.</p><p>'Among Us'</p><p>Technically, \"Among Us\" costs $5 to download on PC, but the free iOS and Android version is effectively the same game. It's most fun with friends, ideally gathered on Zoom or Discord, but you can join a group of strangers online. Each round, most of the up to 15 players are assigned as crewmates, charged with solving puzzles throughout the level. One to three players are secretly selected as impostors, tasked to sabotage and assassinate the crewmates. If anyone finds a body, she can summon the living to a meeting to vote anyone suspicious out of the round. Crewmates win after all impostors are ejected, but be careful. Savvy impostors will deflect blame and survive</p><p>'Brawlhalla'</p><p>Fighting games tend to be easy to learn but difficult to master. \"Brawlhalla\" is no exception. The game starts you off with a selection of nine \"legends\" that you can take into battle against anyone in the world online or your friend beside you on the couch. During each match, you maneuver your character into position to knock your opponents off the stage. As in \"Super Smash Bros.,\" each character has its own movement speed and set of attacks. Finding one that suits you will take time, but as you win matches and complete daily missions, you'll earn in-game currency you can use to unlock all of the game's 55 characters. You're certain to find one that fits your style.</p><p>'Pokémon Go'</p><p>Laugh all you want, but the somewhat silly augmented-reality \"Pokémon\" game with which everyone was obsessed back in the summer of 2016 is still around. And honestly, it's still really good. As before, you'll spend most of your time playing \"Pokémon Go\" roaming around, catching whatever Pokémon you encounter. But now, there's a lot more to do with them. When the game was first released, you couldn't challenge your friends to battles. That's changed, and Niantic, the game's developers, have also added in-game events such as \"boss battles\" with members of the franchise's garish, menacing villains: Team Rocket. (In this case, Team GO Rocket.) Beyond all these tweaks, for newcomers, there's still nothing quite like successfully capturing your first Pidgey.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal is not compensated by retailers listed in its articles as outlets for products.
