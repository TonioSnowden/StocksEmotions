  "text": "<p>In recent weeks, investors began betting that the Fed would raise rates by three-quarters of a percentage point not just in November but in December. That was the latest escalation in interest-rate wagers that have pummeled bonds and stocks for months on end.</p><p>The idea that the central bank might move by just 0.5 percentage point in December sparked an immediate rally Friday in shorter-term Treasurys in particular, given their sensitivity to the near-term interest-rate outlook. The surge in prices gained momentum later Friday, when San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly made comments that investors interpreted as signaling concern about raising rates too quickly.</p><p>Stocks joined bonds in their rally, with the S&amp;P 500 notching a weekly gain of 4.7% and climbing another 1.2% Monday. Investors started this week preparing for earnings from tech companies including Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp., along with data on economic growth and the Fed's preferred inflation gauge.</p><p>Taken together, recent events suggest that \"the debate is shifting towards talking about how to get the market prepared for smaller rate hikes,\" said Thomas Simons, a money-market economist in the fixed-income Group at Jefferies.</p><p>Despite Friday's move, longer-term Treasury yields still ended last week significantly higher than seven days earlier, extending a historically bad year for bond returns that has had broad repercussions across financial markets.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note, which is especially influential in determining borrowing costs throughout the economy, climbed for a 12th consecutive week to finish at 4.212% Friday. It settled Monday at 4.231%, its highest close since June 2008—though still down from the 4.34% level it reached on Friday.</p><p>Yields were fairly stable early last week. But without much of a catalyst, they climbed steeply on Wednesday and Thursday. That presented a setback for stocks, which are sensitive to rising yields because that increases the return investors earn risk-free by holding Treasurys to maturity.</p><p>Some analysts said that Treasurys were still being pressured by the previous week's inflation data, which continued to show a rapid rise in consumer prices. Stubbornly high inflation has led to a significant readjustment in investors' expectations for short-term interest rates set by the Fed—the trajectory of which plays a critical role in determining the level of Treasury yields.</p><p>On Wednesday, interest-rate derivatives for the first time this year showed a better than 50% chance that the Fed would raise its benchmark federal-funds rate above 5% in 2023, though that percentage was down to about 45% on Monday. The fed-funds rate is currently set at a range of 3% to 3.25% after starting the year near zero.</p><p>Investors also remain on edge about the potential for shrinking foreign demand for Treasurys, as global central banks aggressively raise interest rates, and in some cases, intervene in the foreign-exchange market to support their currencies.</p><p>On Friday, momentum toward lower yields was partially offset by signs that Japan had intervened to strengthen the yen for at least the second time in two months. The yen surged abruptly Friday morning a day after the currency had breached 150 yen per dollar, its weakest level in decades.</p><p>Some investors have worried that Japan's government is raising the dollars it needs to buy yen by selling some of its holdings in U.S. Treasurys. A possibly even larger fear is that the weakening yen will force the Bank of Japan to abandon its policy of holding down bond yields, creating a rush among Japanese financial institutions to sell large amounts of U.S. bonds in favor of their own government's debt.</p><p>\"Is the concern that this is a risk to global financial stability warranted? I think yes,\" said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former adviser to the U.S. Trade Representative in the Biden administration.</p><p>BOJ's interest-rate policy \"has contributed to the incentives that have led Japanese pension funds and insurers and other institutional investors to dramatically increase their holdings of foreign bonds over time,\" he said.</p><p>\"Private Japanese investors have become among the biggest buyers of a range of U.S. bonds,\" but they could reduce their holdings if the BOJ shifts course, he added.</p><p>Write to Sam Goldfarb at sam.goldfarb@wsj.com</p><p>Talk of Fed Rate Slowdown Offers Respite for Bonds and Stocks</p>",
