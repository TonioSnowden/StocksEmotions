  "text": "<p>Investors continued to train their attention on bond markets after a drop in the price of U.S. government debt last week. Ten-year Treasury notes recovered some ground Monday, sending yields down to 1.682% from 1.729% on Friday. Yields fall when bond prices rise.</p><p>Yields have climbed for seven consecutive weeks, denting segments of the stock market that had benefited from several years of low interest rates. Tech stocks, in particular, have suffered from the jump in longer-term government borrowing costs. Future earnings are worth less when bond yields rise.</p><p>\"There is more upside for U.S. bond yields than there is downside,\" said Edward Smith, head of asset allocation research at U.K. investment firm Rathbone Investment Management . Stocks \"that delivered exceptional returns last year are probably not going do so well for now,\" Mr. Smith added.</p><p>Among major technology stocks, Apple, Intel , Microsoft and Tesla all gained more than 2% on Monday.</p><p>Many investors expect bond yields to keep rising as the economy picks up speed, posing a challenge to tech stocks that led the broader market higher in 2020.</p><p>That doesn't mean investors should abandon tech stocks, according to Mr. Smith. Shares of giants such as Apple, Microsoft and Facebook have proved resilient on some days when Treasury yields have shot up, he said. However, Mr. Smith added that money managers should be cautious about corners of the market with elevated valuations, such as electric-car stocks.</p><p>Scott Martin, chief investment officer of Kingsview Wealth Management, said that he had been adding beaten-down energy and financial stocks in recent months, while selectively trimming the firm's holdings of technology shares.</p><p>\"We have pared back some of the hotter tech names,\" he said.</p><p>Investors have kept a close eye on the Federal Reserve to see whether it will address the rise in bond yields, but the U.S. central bank has so far indicated that it isn't concerned.</p><p>New data showed sales of previously owned homes fell 6.6% in February from the previous month, a steeper decline than economists expected, amid tight inventory and severe weather in parts of the country.</p><p>Still, the February sales marked a 9.1% increase from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. The U.S. housing market has boomed in the past year, as buyers took advantage of low interest rates and the pandemic prompted new demand for homes with space to work remotely.</p><p>Tech was the best-performing sector of the S&amp;P 500 on Monday. In all, seven of the index's 11 sectors were in positive territory. Financial stocks were the worst-performing sector.</p><p>In corporate news, railroad operator Kansas City Southern rallied $24.93 a share, or 11%, to $249.09 after agreeing to be bought by Canadian Pacific Railway in a transaction valued at about $25 billion. New York-listed shares of Canadian Pacific slid $21.95, or 5.8% to $356.53.</p><p>In currencies, Turkey's lira slumped more than 7% to 7.78 per dollar after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired the country's top central banker late last week.</p><p>The Turkish stock market also tumbled on the news, with the benchmark Borsa Istanbul 100 stock index falling 9.8%.</p><p>The lira's slide may add to investors' nervousness around emerging-market assets, according to Jane Foley , head of currency strategy at Rabobank .</p><p>Combined with concerns about the trajectory of U.S. government bond yields, the slump in Turkey's currency means there is \"plenty of scope for choppy trading conditions\" in broader financial markets, Ms. Foley said.</p><p>In other overseas markets, the Stoxx Europe 600 ticked up 0.2%. Shares of AstraZeneca advanced 3.3% after the British drugmaker said its Covid-19 vaccine was shown to be safe and 79% effective in preventing symptomatic disease in U.S. clinical trials.</p><p>Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average was up 0.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 1.3% and the Shanghai Composite was down 1.2%. U.S. stock futures were down 0.1%.</p>",
