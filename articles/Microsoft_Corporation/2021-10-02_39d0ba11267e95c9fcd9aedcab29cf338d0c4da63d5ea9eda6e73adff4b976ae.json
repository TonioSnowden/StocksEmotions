  "text": "<p>   Under questioning from Apple's lawyer, Mr. Cook said the company had never tried to determine the specific profitability of the App Store as a stand-alone business and that he couldn't put an exact figure on how profitable it might be. The practice of not tracking business-unit profitability, he said, dated back to a desire by Mr. Jobs to encourage cooperation across the company's various units. The internal document that calculated operating margin, which wasn't made public, was a \"one-off presentation,\" he said. </p><p>   Nevertheless, Mr. Cook said he believed the App Store was profitable even without calculating it. \"We haven't done that, but, you know, I have a feel -- if you will,\" Mr. Cook said. While being questioned by the judge, Mr. Cook said a majority of App Store revenue came from games. </p><p>   The judge ruled that Apple wasn't a monopoly in part because the mobile gaming market is evolving so quickly, including the nascent streaming game services. Similar to how Netflix Inc. offers movies, Microsoft, chip maker Nvidia Corp. and others are pushing subscription game services that could be accessed on iPhones through websites. That allows them to bypass the App Store. </p><p>   As for Apple's gaming economy, it is unclear what happens next. Epic plans to appeal the judge's ruling, and some legal observers said Apple will appeal the order to stop prohibiting developers from communicating cheaper alternatives to the App Store. The company said it is reviewing the matter. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Sarah E. Needleman contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
