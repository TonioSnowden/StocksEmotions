  "text": "<p>Microsoft shares fell 1.6% after the software company cut sales and earnings guidance for the current quarter, citing the impact of foreign exchange rates as the stronger U.S. dollar takes a toll. Investors said this is the latest example of companies facing margin pressure this year.</p><p>Investors have struggled in recent months to assess how much and how quickly the Federal Reserve will boost interest rates in a quest to temper inflation. Some money managers worry that policy tightening could slow economic growth or even tip the U.S. into a recession.</p><p>Supply-chain disruptions exacerbated by the pandemic have been further hit by the war in Ukraine and China's zero-Covid strategy. This has added to the cost of energy, food and other commodities this year.</p><p>Crude prices gained after OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers led by Russia agreed to a bigger-than-expected oil-production increase.</p><p>Futures for Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, were recently up about 0.4% to $116.80. The market had expected supply to rise at a meeting between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' 13 members and 10 non-OPEC producers Thursday. The U.S. and Europe have pressed the group, dubbed OPEC+, to pump more crude, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine has sent oil prices soaring above $100 a barrel.</p><p>\"The fear is that demand is still outstripping supply and that supply increase doesn't make up for the difference,\" said Peter E. Klingelhofer, managing director, investment management at investment advisory firm Hamilton Capital in Columbus, Ohio. His firm is overweight on energy equities.</p><p>Some OPEC members were exploring the idea of suspending Russia's participation in a production deal, as Western sanctions and a partial European ban begin to undercut Moscow's ability to pump more, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note traded at 2.911% Thursday from 2.930% Wednesday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>An effort to ship grain stranded by the Russia-Ukraine war showed progress Wednesday. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has been leading discussions on how to transport grain and sunflower oil that has been blockaded in Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea—and to get Russian grain and fertilizer to world markets.</p><p>\"It's a very difficult environment. There are so many factors at play here, and the dynamics are very difficult to interpret,\" said Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank. \"We think the Fed will have to be extremely aggressive to get inflation under control.\"</p><p>Federal Reserve Vice Chairwoman Lael Brainard on Thursday said half percentage point interest-rate increases would likely be appropriate at the Fed's next two meetings, but didn't commit to a particular path for subsequent meetings.</p><p>Investors are monitoring data on the labor market. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has expressed concern in recent months that the labor market is overheating. A tight labor market can add to inflation as competition for workers boosts wage-bargaining power.</p><p>The ADP employment report showed that the private sector added 128,000 jobs in May, lower than the 299,000 that economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected. Initial jobless claims dropped to 200,000 last week from the previous week's revised level of 211,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. The number is viewed as a proxy for layoffs.</p><p>In individual stocks, shares of Chewy rallied 19% after the online pet-products retailer turned in a surprise profit and forecast a revenue range that was mostly above Wall Street estimates. MongoDB shares rose 18% after the database company's results topped Wall Street estimates.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.5%. U.K. markets were closed for a holiday.</p><p>Major indexes in Asia closed lower, with South Korea's Kospi and Hong Kong's Hang Seng each falling 1%. Japan's Nikkei 225 edged down 0.2%, while China's Shanghai Composite bucked the trend to add 0.4%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Hardika Singh at hardika.singh@wsj.com</p><p>S&amp;P 500, Nasdaq Rise in Mixed Session</p>",
