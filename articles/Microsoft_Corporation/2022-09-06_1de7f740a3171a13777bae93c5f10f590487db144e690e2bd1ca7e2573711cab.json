  "text": "<p>You can see the parallel: Donald Trump is Mr. Big, \"MAGA Republicans\" are KAOS, and Mr. Biden is in CONTROL. The Chief warns: \"Max, this is a big one. The fate of our entire nation may depend on it.\" Mr. Biden: \"Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.\"</p><p>Mr. Big plans to start by destroying the Statue of Liberty. As Max puts it: \"So that's their target. Miss Liberty herself!\" \"We, the people,\" Mr. Biden intoned, \"have burning inside of each of us the flame of liberty that was lit here at Independence Hall. . . . That sacred flame still burns.\"</p><p>Great satire uses exaggeration not only for comic effect, but to illustrate the absurdity of the issue at hand. Hence Alexander Pope's mock-epic poem \"The Rape of the Lock\" centers on the theft of a strand of a woman's hair, likening the purloining to the abduction of Helen of Troy. The disproportion between deed and reaction results in both comedy and the revelation of truth. \"What mighty contests rise from trivial things,\" Pope's narrative begins. Mr. Brooks made a glorious career out of this genre, ridiculing everything from westerns (\"Blazing Saddles\") and Alfred Hitchcock thrillers (\"High Anxiety\") to Hitler and Nazism (\"The Producers\").</p><p>Mr. Biden's speech, despite its flimsy attempt at admonitory statesmanship, was a translucid partisan bid for votes in the midterm elections, its exaggerations at once obvious and ridiculous.</p><p>At the end of the \"Mr. Big\" episode, Maxwell Smart congratulates himself: \"Mission accomplished. KAOS destroyed. That's the end of Mr. Big. If only he could have turned his evil genius intoâ€”niceness.\" In accepting the 2020 presidential nomination, Mr. Biden said: \"It's a moment that calls for hope and light and love.\" If only he would follow the advice his predecessor often tweeted: \"Get Smart!\"</p><p>Mr. Opelka is a musical-theater composer-lyricist.</p><p>Biden's Speech Casts Him as Maxwell Smart</p>",
