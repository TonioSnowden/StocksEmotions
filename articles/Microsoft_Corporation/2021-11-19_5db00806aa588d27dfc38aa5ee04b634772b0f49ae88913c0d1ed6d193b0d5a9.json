Kevin Stitt commuted the death sentence of Julius Jones to life without parole Thursday, hours before Mr. Jones was scheduled to be executed, in a case that had drawn doubts from the state's pardon and parole board. </p><p>\n  \"After prayerful consideration and reviewing materials presented by all sides of this case, I have determined to commute Julius Jones' sentence to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole,\" said Mr. Stitt, a Republican. </p><p>\n  Mr. Jones was a 19-year-old student at the University of Oklahoma when he was arrested and prosecuted in the 1999 death of Paul Howell, who was fatally shot during a carjacking. Mr. Jones, now 41, was convicted of first-degree murder in 2002 and sentenced to death. His co-defendant, Christopher Jordan, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Mr. Jordan testified against Mr. Jones at the trial. Mr. Jones, who has been incarcerated for nearly 20 years, has long maintained his innocence. </p><p>\n  The case drew national attention with celebrities and athletes calling Mr. Jones's incarceration a miscarriage of justice. Hundreds of students protested outside Mr. Stitts's office this week, and more than 6.5 million people signed an online petition asking him to stop the execution. </p><p>\n  -- Deanna Paul </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  ART AUCTIONS </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Constitution Copy Is </p><p>\n  Sold for $43 Million </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  A rare, first-edition copy of the U.S. Constitution sold for $43.2 million at Sotheby's Thursday. It appears the winner is a private collector rather than an online group of cryptocurrency investors. </p><p>\n  The group, called ConstitutionDAO, caused a stir by pooling more than $40 million to bid, but an anonymous phone bidder pledged even more and will take home one of the 13 surviving official copies of the Constitution. </p><p>\n  The document is the priciest in auction history, surpassing Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates's $30.8 million copy of Leonardo da Vinci's scientific notebook known as the Codex Leicester. </p><p>\n  -- Kelly Crow </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  OLYMPICS </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Diplomatic Boycott of </p><p>\n  Beijing Games Mulled </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  President Biden said Thursday that the U.S. government is considering a diplomatic boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, a decision that could bar government officials from attending the games. </p><p>\n  On Wednesday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman sidestepped a question about a possible boycott and said the Olympics \"is a stage for all winter sports athletes around the world. It is them that should be in the spotlight.\" </p><p>\n  Human-rights groups have called for a boycott, citing China's treatment of ethnic Uyghurs. </p><p>\n  -- Tarini Parti and Louise Radnofsky </p><p></p>",
