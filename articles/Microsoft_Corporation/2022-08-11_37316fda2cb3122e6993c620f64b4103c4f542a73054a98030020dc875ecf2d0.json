  "text": "<p>Linguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.</p><p>When the FBI executed a search warrant at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida on Monday, the search on the property was characterized by countless headlines as a \"raid.\"</p><p>But was that the appropriate word? Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg, a Democrat, said it was \"a gross exaggeration\" to call the FBI search a \"raid.\" \"This was a very orderly, smooth search of a home conducted by plainclothes FBI agents, escorted by Secret Service agents,\" he told The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Speaking to MSNBC, Mr. Aronberg elaborated that Mr. Trump \"benefits from calling it a 'raid,' or a 'siege,' because then he gets to be the MAGA martyr.\" (Mr. Trump released a statement on Monday night calling the search an \"unannounced raid\" that was \"not necessary or appropriate,\" while the Justice Department has not commented publicly about the investigation.)</p><p>Even if the search was conducted in an orderly manner in accordance with the law, it might still fit the popular understanding of a \"raid.\" The Oxford English Dictionary, for instance, defines the relevant sense of the word as \"a surprise visit by police to arrest suspects or seize illicit goods.\" While no one was arrested, FBI agents conducting the Mar-a-Lago search seized boxes of documents as part of an investigation into Mr. Trump's handling of classified information.</p><p>Before a \"raid\" was something undertaken by law-enforcement officials, the word traveled a long and twisty etymological road. In fact, the word \"raid\" is historically related to both \"road\" and \"ride.\"</p><p>\"Ride\" goes back to a Germanic root to describe traveling on horseback. \"Road\" originally referred to the act of riding, or a journey while riding a horse, before it evolved to name the path that such a journey could take.</p><p>By the 14th century, \"raid\" emerged as a Scottish variant of \"road.\" Both \"raid\" and \"road\" could refer not just to any journey on horseback but specifically to a military expedition, like a hostile foray into a foreign territory. One chronicle relates how the Scottish king David II led a \"rade\" of northern England in the 1340s, when Scotland allied with France in the Hundred Years' War.</p><p>While \"road\" lost its meaning of a hostile incursion in favor of its modern use for public thoroughfares, the Scottish form \"raid\" persisted in its more belligerent sense. For a few centuries, \"raid\" was not very common in English beyond the dialects of Scotland and northern England, but the writer Sir Walter Scott, a Scotsman himself, helped to change that.</p><p>Scott's swashbuckling historical tales were responsible for repopularizing many older words, such as \"ransom\" and \"henchman.\" He collected Scottish ballads recounting \"raids\" into English territories, publishing them in \"Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border\" in 1802.</p><p>In the mid-19th century, \"raid\" got extended to describe various sudden attacks or operations, including by police. An 1859 article in a Dublin newspaper described a crackdown on Scottish pubs: \"The police raid could not be so suddenly made as [to] catch the drinkers off their guard.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, \"raid\" began to be used as a verb as well, with those doing the raiding called \"raiders.\"</p><p>The word continued to gain new combative uses in the 20th century. World War I introduced \"air raids\" for aircraft attacks bombing targets on the ground. In 1956, S.C. Johnson &amp; Son began marketing an insecticide under the brand name Raid, with the promise that it \"kills bugs dead.\" And in the business world, a \"raid\" could refer to a hostile takeover of a company, with a swift operation at the open of the trading day dubbed a \"dawn raid.\"</p><p>Even \"raiding the refrigerator\" for a midnight snack carries with it an echo of more aggressive forays. Centuries of contentious history can't help but give \"raid\" an unfriendly tinge.</p><p>From a Journey on Horseback to a Knock at the Door</p>",
