  "text": "<p>A week later, ahead of a town hall for Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego in downtown Phoenix, constituent Richard Wilce wrote a question on a card: Would Mr. Gallego challenge Sen. Kyrsten Sinema in a 2024 primary? \"I think Sinema is a DINO\"—a Democrat in name only—Mr. Wilce said. \"She's got to go.\"</p><p>Around the country, voters, elected officials and campaign operatives are battling to answer the question of what it means to be an authentic Republican or Democrat as the midterm election season begins. The question is especially acute in Arizona, a knife-edge state where voter demographics are in flux. Both parties are divided over their own answers, albeit for very different reasons.</p><p>One result so far isn't good for either of them: the fastest-growing voter block is independents, many of whom view each party as both increasingly extreme and internally at odds.</p><p>Stark disagreements over former President Donald Trump's false claims that he won the 2020 election have torn the state GOP apart.</p><p>Several pro-Trump candidates are openly slamming the state's most prominent and powerful Republican, Gov. Doug Ducey, who certified the state's election results for President Biden.</p><p>He can't run again in November because of term limits. He and his allies say that promoting economic growth and traditional conservative policies are the best way to attract voters and that tying the party to Mr. Trump's stolen election claims is unhelpful.</p><p>His pro-Trump critics see a different version of reality. They say the only problem worth worrying about is that Mr. Trump was denied victory in 2020. One is Kari Lake, a former longtime Phoenix television news anchor now running for governor, with Mr. Trump's endorsement.</p><p>A recent ad she ran on local TV stations said viewers were \"in the middle of watching a fake news program. You know how to know it's fake? Because they won't even cover the biggest story out there: the rigged election of 2020.\"</p><p>Arizona Democrats, meanwhile, are wrangling over how much flexibility members have to break with their party.</p><p>The state in 2020 backed a Democrat for president for the first time since 1996, and elected a second Democratic senator, Mark Kelly, for the first time since the 1950s. Mr. Kelly, a former astronaut, joined Ms. Sinema, who won her seat in 2018.</p><p>Since those triumphs, though, the party has divided into several camps. Ms. Sinema is in one. In another are the Democrats' core supporters, furious over her refusal to change Senate rules to enable Democrats to pass federal election laws, which party leaders said were needed to counter new measures in Republican-led states. A third group includes people like Mr. Kelly and others running for office, who have sought to keep the Democratic voter base satisfied without fully embracing the party's most liberal positions.</p><p>Relations are now so strained that Ms. Sinema speaks to few Democrats in the state, according to several Arizona Democrats, and largely ignores grass-roots activists.</p><p>Her supporters, however, see her isolation as its own political statement: being perceived as iconoclastic, they say, is the best way to appeal to independent voters in a state that for decades elected the late Sen. John McCain, a Republican known nationwide for bucking GOP orthodoxy who was the party's presidential candidate in 2008.</p><p>Hannah Hurley, a spokeswoman for Ms. Sinema, said the senator has \"always promised Arizonans she would be an independent voice for the state.\" Ms. Hurley said Ms. Sinema speaks frequently with Arizona stakeholders, including Democrats and activists.</p><p>Arizona was home to the late Sen. Barry Goldwater, seen as the father of the modern conservative movement and Republican nominee for president in 1964.</p><p>Rapid population growth and changing demographics have altered the political mix. Phoenix, the capital, grew at the fastest rate of any major city over the past decade, according to the U.S. census.</p><p>Voters statewide today are split roughly into thirds between Republicans, Democrats and independents, according to the Arizona Secretary of State's office, with independents gaining share in recent years at the expense of both parties.</p><p>From July 2021 through the start of January 2022, the number of independents increased by about 50,000, Republicans edged up by just over 6,500 and Democrats lost about 4,500, data from the Arizona Secretary of State's office show. Mr. Biden won the state by just over 10,000 votes in 2020, but his approval rating has fallen to around 40% in a recent poll by nonpartisan Phoenix-based OH Predictive Insights.</p><p>Christine Bloom, a 69-year-old part-time retail worker from Phoenix, said she was a registered Republican until 2012 when she became a Democrat. After the 2016 election, she switched her registration to independent.</p><p>\"You're not getting statesmen, you're getting party-line people who aren't really looking for what's good for the country,\" Ms. Bloom said.</p><p>Republican efforts to capitalize on Mr. Biden's weak standing have been overshadowed by their own split. \"You don't come back from this. I mean one side or the other wins,\" said Bill Gates, the chairman of the Board of Supervisors in Maricopa County, the state's largest county.</p><p>Mr. Gates describes himself as an outcast in his party after his GOP-majority board denied claims that the county mishandled the election. He has said he has received dozens of threats.</p><p>There has been no evidence of false ballots or election fraud on a large enough scale to change the presidential result, according to election officials in the state. A controversial Republican-backed audit last year hand-counted and photographed nearly 2.1 million Maricopa County votes. The review confirmed Mr. Biden's win.</p><p>Donald Adams, a 67-year-old handyman from Mesa, volunteered on the audit for 37 days. He said the review may have shown Mr. Biden won, but it was because he thinks the ballots themselves were fraudulent.</p><p>\"I'm still wearing my Trump 2020 hat, because we can't move on to 2022 and 2024 unless we fix 2020,\" he said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you think people will vote in the Arizona elections? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Election-fraud claims remain a top issue in the GOP primaries slated for August.</p><p>\"You can't work to solve any of those problems if the people we're electing aren't actually making it into office,\" said Ms. Lake, the former anchor running for governor.</p><p>Several people close to Mr. Ducey, the state's term-limited GOP governor, said he is open to backing any Republican candidate to succeed him—except for Ms. Lake. He believes the party should focus on issues that have broad appeal and avoid relitigating the 2020 election.</p><p>\"That idea of building a coalition of focusing on addition and multiplication versus division and subtraction is a winning plan in the Republican Party,\" said Mr. Ducey.</p><p>Another GOP candidate in the governor's race echoed him. \"I don't want to get caught in the liberal trap of staying on the 2020 battlefield,\" said Karrin Taylor Robson.</p><p>A poll from OH Predictive Insights in January found that about one-third of independents had a favorable opinion of Mr. Trump, compared with two-thirds who had an unfavorable opinion. That suggests close alignment with the former president and focusing on 2020 may not serve Republicans well.</p><p>\"We have every opportunity right now to blow it as well, if we don't, out of our primaries, put forth candidates who can win general elections,\" said Kathy Petsas, the GOP chairwoman for one of the state's most competitive legislative districts.</p><p>After the Republican National Committee censured two Trump critics in the GOP over their role in the House's Jan. 6 investigation, she texted a Wall Street Journal reporter: \"My party has taken a ride with Thelma &amp; Louise.\"</p><p>Tension between Democrats and Ms. Sinema has escalated since Mr. Biden took office and Democrats took control of the 50-50 Senate. The senator played a central role in passing Mr. Biden's infrastructure bill and has supported his judicial nominees.</p><p>But a series of positions that have held up Mr. Biden's legislative agenda, especially her blocking of the effort by many Democrats to change Senate filibuster rules in order to pass a federal voting law, infuriated Democrats' core supporters and many elected officials.</p><p>Several groups have formed to raise money to support a primary challenge to her when she faces re-election in 2024. One group, the Primary Sinema Project, has raised more than $400,000 from grass-roots donors since its launch in January, according to a spokesman.</p><p>Mr. Gallego, the representative from central Phoenix, said he is considering a challenge. He said Ms. Sinema may pick up some independents' support with her centrist stances but she will bleed Democratic backing. \"She's absolutely deflating voters in Arizona right now,\" he said.</p><p>The Democrats' more immediate challenge is ensuring the re-election of Mr. Kelly, the other senator from Arizona. Thanks to some support from independents and moderate Republicans, the former astronaut narrowly won the remaining two years of Mr. McCain's term and is running for his own six-year term this year.</p><p>Unlike the crowded GOP side, Mr. Kelly isn't facing a primary challenge. He has sought to maintain the support of the party faithful while also recently seeking some independence from the Biden administration. He and Ms. Sinema joined Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) and Republicans to sink Mr. Biden's nominee to a top position in the Labor Department. Both Arizona senators have also objected to Mr. Biden's policies regarding a surge in immigrants crossing the southern border. A recent TV ad said Mr. Kelly was working to \"improve border security.\"</p><p>\"Sen. Kelly is an independent leader who Arizonans trust to always put them first,\" said Emma Brown, his campaign manager.</p><p>Republican John Giles, the mayor of the city of Mesa, said Mr. Kelly is positioning himself as well as he can, given Democrats' bleak prospects overall in the midterms.</p><p>\"He comes across as a moderate Democrat to Republicans. He passes the litmus test for being a Democrat to Democrats, more so than Sen. Sinema does,\" he said.</p><p>Not everyone agrees. \"When the Democrats say 'jump,' he says, 'how high?' \" said Eric Lovelis, 52, a Phoenix small-business owner, who attended the Lamon rally.</p><p>Alexa Corse contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Eliza Collins at eliza.collins+1@wsj.com.</p><p>With Arizona a Toss-Up in Midterms, Infighting Reigns Among GOP, Democrats</p>",
