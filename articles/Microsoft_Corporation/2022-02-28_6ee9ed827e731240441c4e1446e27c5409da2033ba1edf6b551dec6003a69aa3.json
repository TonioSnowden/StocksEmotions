  "title": "Populist Embrace of Putin Cools After Ukraine Invasion; Europe's populists, who saw Vladimir Putin as a kindred spirit, are now distancing themselves from the Russian president",
  "text": "<p>Matteo Salvini of Italy's main anti-immigrant party has worn T-shirts emblazoned with Mr. Putin's face. Eric Zemmour, a far-right candidate in France's April presidential elections, once said he dreamed that someone like Mr. Putin would save France. Marine Le Pen of France's far-right National Rally traveled to the Kremlin to meet Mr. Putin.</p><p>Read live updates on Russia's invasion of Ukraine</p><p>What Europe's populists saw in Mr. Putin was a kindred spirit, a leader willing to disregard the rules of international cooperation that emerged in the wake of World War II, underpinned by the military might of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. They admired Mr. Putin's unapologetic nationalism and his deep-seated distrust of the U.S.</p><p>That admiration is now running up against the reality of Mr. Putin's forces pouring into Ukraine. Some populists are rushing to distance themselves, branding Mr. Putin's aggression a setback of historic proportions.</p><p>Others are trying to strike a balance, rejecting Mr. Putin's actions while acknowledging he has a place in their political heart.</p><p>\"I think that everybody has a form of admiration for Mr. Putin, but frankly, I consider that what he's done is highly reprehensible,\" Ms. Le Pen said Friday.</p><p>\"No to war, always. Yes to life, always,\" Mr. Salvini, leader of Italy's League party, wrote in a Twitter post Thursday. Mr. Salvini wrote that he \"firmly condemns the military aggression\" but stopped short of mentioning Mr. Putin by name.</p><p>Before the invasion Mr. Putin could find vocal support across populism's political spectrum. In Germany, which has been under pressure to wean itself off Russian gas for years, Mr. Putin found ardent allies in Alternative for Germany, a nationalist and anti-Islam group, as well as the Left, a far-left party partially derived from the Communist Party that ruled former East Germany, an erstwhile Soviet dominion, until 1990.</p><p>Both parties toned down their support for the Kremlin as Russia ramped up its forces on the Ukrainian border, and both issued condemnations of the all-out invasion on Thursday.</p><p>\"Russia's attack on Ukraine can't be justified by anything. Russia must stop military action and pull out its troops from Ukraine,\" AfD leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla said Thursday.</p><p>That was a change in tone for Mr. Chrupalla. \"Russia's skepticism about the West and its related security interests are not unfounded,\" Mr. Chrupalla said on Feb. 19. \"Instead of continuing to put Russia under military-strategic pressure, signals of de-escalation should be sent.\"</p><p>The Left's floor leader in parliament, Dietmar Bartsch, described the Russia's bombing raids as \"a new level of aggression by Putin that we condemn in the sharpest terms,\" adding that \"this attack is against international law and cannot possibly be justified.\"</p><p>That was a far cry from comments fellow Left legislator Sevim Dağdelen made at a recent rally in Berlin where she accused the U.S. of warmongering and dismissed Ukraine's position as a \"declaration of war against Russia.\"</p><p>Prewar support for Mr. Putin isn't a uniquely populist phenomenon. Former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of Germany's Social Democratic Party is a personal friend of Mr. Putin who works for several Russian state-controlled companies. He has long supported Moscow in its standoff with Ukraine and has accused Kyiv of saber rattling.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Schröder called on Moscow to end the war in a post on his LinkedIn page. \"The war and the suffering it causes for people in Ukraine must stop as soon as possible. This is the responsibility of the Russian government,\" he wrote. He added that both sides had made many mistakes and expressed hope that the Western sanctions, while necessary, won't completely sever the relations between Europe and Russia's political world.</p><p>What distinguishes Europe's populists is how Mr. Putin has played a role in raising their profiles. Supporting Europe's populist leaders was a way for Mr. Putin to shake the Western establishment without firing a shot.</p><p>Ms. Le Pen's party has long had ties with Russia. In 2014, Ms. Le Pen's party, which struggled to find lenders in France, borrowed 9 million euros, equivalent to $10.1 million, from First Czech-Russian Bank, a now-defunct bank that was based in Moscow, to help fund its campaign for seats in the European Parliament.</p><p>That same year Ms. Le Pen opposed the adoption of sanctions meant to punish Moscow for its annexation of part of Ukraine and its support for rebels in the country's east.</p><p>When Ms. Le Pen ran against Emmanuel Macron in the 2017 presidential elections, Mr. Putin welcomed her at the Kremlin, just weeks before the first round of voting.</p><p>\"I know that you represent a political spectrum in Europe, which is growing rapidly,\" Mr. Putin told Ms. Le Pen.</p><p>Over the years, Italy's Mr. Salvini has posted photos on Facebook wearing Putin T-shirts, including one taken in Moscow's Red Square in 2015 where he protested against Western sanctions on Russia. Another post showed him donning a Putin T-shirt in the European Parliament with a caption referring to Italian President Sergio Mattarella that read: \"I'd swap two president Mattarellas for half a Putin.\"</p><p>Support for Mr. Putin has also dovetailed with populist opposition to Western institutions like NATO.</p><p>\"Me, if I was president, I would leave NATO,\" Mr. Zemmour told French radio days before Russia launched its sweeping invasion. \"I think that NATO no longer has a raison d'être, it's old-fashioned and obsolete.\"</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Zemmour changed his tone. \"Last night, Russia decided to hit Ukraine even if Ukraine had not attacked it and did not threaten it directly. I unreservedly condemn this use of force,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Noemie Bisserbe at noemie.bisserbe@wsj.com, Bojan Pancevski at bojan.pancevski@wsj.com and Eric Sylvers at eric.sylvers@wsj.com</p><p>Populist Embrace of Putin Cools After Ukraine Invasion</p>",
