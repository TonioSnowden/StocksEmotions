  "text": "<p>There is a reason companies such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon are made in the U.S. Freedom breeds innovation. Chinese crackdowns breed fear, including the fear of nationalization. How hard do people work to innovate when they are afraid that their success can lead to the government taking away everything they have worked to build?</p><p>It will be a long time before China catches up to America. And the more that President Xi Jinping suppresses his people, the longer it will take.</p><p>Eliyahu Kaufman</p><p>Dallas</p><p>While low U.S. standards in teaching math, at least compared with China's, are a problem, America's competitive advantage is in attracting international students and turning them into immigrants.</p><p>More than 70% of full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and computer and information sciences at U.S. universities are international students. The 85,000-annual limit on H-1B visas and the low number of employment-based green cards (and a per-country limit) harm U.S. competitiveness. Our research has found 1.5 million U.S. job vacancies in computer occupations, limiting the ability of U.S. companies to grow and innovate.</p><p>Many China hawks also favor more immigration restrictions. The Trump administration carried on a virtual war with universities and high-tech employers over immigration and enacted a proclamation that stopped admitting H-1B visa holders and employment-based immigrants.</p><p>Mr. Trump also abandoned individual security screenings for many graduate students from China in favor of blanket visa denials for students who once attended a university on a proscribed list. The Biden administration has continued this unwise policy that is likely to undermine U.S. competitiveness in science and engineering more than even the lax standards at U.S. elementary schools ever could.</p><p>Stuart Anderson</p><p>National Foundation for American Policy</p><p>Arlington, Va.</p><p>I'm hardly impressed by a dictatorial regime that suppresses children's creativity and liveliness at such a young age for the purpose of making them Communist Party bots. Isn't it ironic that the kind of \"coddling,\" creative play, and imagination promoted here eventually fosters Yankee ingenuity, which yields the very things the Chinese so often resort to stealing?</p><p>Stacey Sauter</p><p>Potomac, Md.</p><p>The American Way of Education, Immigration and Innovation</p>",
