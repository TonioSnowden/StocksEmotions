  "text": "<p>For First Steps, a charity based in the English Midlands that offers counselling to people with eating disorders, the decision to go paperless before the Covid-19 pandemic delivered a productivity gain any small business would have envied.</p> <p>Instead of increased profits, the dividend was paid out in the number of daily sessions the organisation's counsellors could complete, rising from five to six.</p> <p>“Before digitising the process we spent 10 to 20 minutes after every session completing paper records, scanning and then filing them,” said chief executive Kevin Parkinson. “Introducing the technology has enabled us to handle more cases, and handle them better.”&#xa0;</p> <p>With the charitable sector now receiving nearly £15bn a year in government grants and employing more than 900,000 people, there are growing calls for it to be included in ministers' drive to address the longstanding productivity crisis in British business.</p> <p>Sir Charlie Mayfield, the former chair of the John Lewis Partnership who was tasked by former prime minister David Cameron with improving the poor productivity of small businesses, is among those calling for the “third sector” to receive similar assistance.</p> <p>Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced £520mn in 2021 for the government's Help to Grow scheme, which seeks to offer discounted business advice to 130,000 small businesses, and Mayfield believes charities would benefit from the same kind of advice.</p> <p>“Integrating the social sector into the country's broader productivity drive needs to become a priority. Opening Help to Grow for the charitable sector would be a start, but it's the model that has scope — we need Help to Grow, but tailored for the third sector,” he said.</p> <p>Lord Gus O'Donnell, a former cabinet secretary and chair of Pro Bono Economics, a charity providing economics expertise to the sector, echoed this — calling for it to be introduced at the next Budget.</p> <p>“It would be a great investment for taxpayers, and it's entirely consistent with the levelling up agenda because you're helping the worst-off in society which is fundamental to addressing staff shortages and our labour supply issue,” he added.</p> <p>The charity sector, which has total income of nearly £85bn a year, is three times less likely than the wider economy to invest in the leadership development critical to productivity enhancement, according to a survey of 500 medium and large charities and social enterprises by Clare Social Leadership, a consultancy.</p> <p>Mayfield, who chairs Be the Business, a charity that offers mentoring and productivity advice to SMEs, said he believed the same principles could be applied to the so-called third sector.</p> <p>“New technology and kit is vital, but mentoring and creating space for leaders to think is the key to improving productivity, which is ‘the' single biggest thing holding back our economy,” he added.</p> <p>However the business department said that Help to Grow was targeted only at SMEs likely to benefit from intensive leadership training and indicated it had no plans to broaden the remit of the scheme. </p> <p>“Social enterprises continue to receive government support, including £20mn in blended finance, as announced in the levelling up white paper,” it added.</p> <p>Compared to businesses, charities often find it harder to invest in productivity enhancements because most donations are linked to delivering a direct outcome, said Peter Osborne, chief operations officer of the <a href=\"https://www.guidedogs.org.uk/\">Guide Dogs</a> charity, which trains dogs for the blind.</p> <p>Osborne, who has an MBA focusing on operations management, said the organisation was always looking for further efficiencies in its dog supply chain, which involves breeding some 2,000 puppies a year, of which only about half will make the grade.</p> <p>Among the current areas of focus are ways to standardise dog training, which can vary between five and 10 months per animal, as well as better processes for identifying which young dogs are more likely to succeed before time and money are invested in their training.</p> <p>“If you can reach assessment early on, then you could take out an awful lot of cost given one trainer takes four dogs through a training cycle for 20-30 weeks,” he explained.</p> <p>In some areas corporate sponsors can also help. Guide Dogs has already streamlined the manufacture of its harnesses using production line management techniques shared during a <a href=\"https://mag.toyota.co.uk/guide-dogs-toyota-production-system/\">partnership</a> with the Japanese carmaker Toyota.</p> <p>“Getting really under the hood of that cost analysis and supply chain management is where even an organisation of the scale of ours is always looking for further assistance,” Osborne added.</p> <p>For other charities, like Enable Scotland, which delivers social care and employment training for local government, it is more traditional management process improvement that can deliver both better services and value for money.</p> <p>Theresa Shearer, Enable Scotland's group chief executive who spent a decade in the HR outsourcing industry before moving into the charity sector, said the charity has cut back office costs from 14 per cent to 10 per cent since she took over in 2015.&#xa0;</p> <p>The efficiencies had been driven by digitisation, doubling the scale of the charity's operations from £30mn to £65mn and a strategic decision not to take on government contracts that ate up Enable's reserves because they were priced at a point that required subsidy.</p> <p>Advice from a former Microsoft Scotland executive who works for Enable two days a month had helped create bespoke technology that freed up more of carers' time for patients and improved working conditions and staff retention levels, she added.</p> <p>“We are a purpose-driven charity, but applying as much discipline as we can, with really quite stringent rules, means that as much of our money as possible gets to the front line,” she said. </p><p>Source: Peter Foster in London 2022 'Give charities same help as small businesses to boost UK productivity, ministers urged' FT.com 5 July.
