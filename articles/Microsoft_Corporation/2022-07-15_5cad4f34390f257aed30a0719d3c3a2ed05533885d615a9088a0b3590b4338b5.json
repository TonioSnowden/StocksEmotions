  "title": "Of Sharks and Samaritans; California man describes a remarkable rescue.",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Bruemmer describes swimming roughly 150 yards from shore when he was suddenly bitten \"ferociously by a shark right across my thighs and my abdomen and it grabbed me and pulled me up\" and then \"down in the water\" and then \"it spit me out.\"</p><p>He theorizes this was because the shark prefers to dine on seals rather than people. But the shark didn't go away. Mr. Bruemmer continues:</p><p>... it was looking at me... and I thought it could bite me again so I pushed it with my hand and I kicked at it with my foot and it left. I got myself back to the surface and started yelling for help and that's when all my luck changed... I started yelling and ... two people... on paddle boards.. veered over to me, one a nurse and one a policeman who had his cell phone with him and called 911 immediately.</p><p>Another Good Samaritan brought a surfboard from the beach to rescue Mr. Bruemmer. He continues the story:</p><p>The three of them in the bloody water got me up onto the surfboard and pulled me into the beach. Heroes—how do you get in bloody water with maybe a shark circling beneath you to save a stranger? They're... amazing. I got to the beach and there were two ICU nurses and a doctor at the beach who took their own t-shirts and made tourniquets. I had tourniquets on my legs and arms within five minutes to stop the bleeding. Otherwise I bleed to death... They carried me to the ambulance. In 40 minutes after the 911 call, I had gotten the 28 miles to the Natividad trauma center... They saved my life in a two-hour operation that used 28 units of blood. Thank you, blood donors. Without you, I don't make it. They saved me. Two days later they repaired my thighs so that one day I'll be able to walk again.</p><p>In the video Mr. Bruemmer continues thanking everyone involved in his rescue and recovery, from the people on the beach to the hospital cleaning crew. And why shouldn't he? With one rather glaring exception, it turned out to be his lucky day.</p><p>There's an old saying that you make your own luck. Thank goodness that after the attack Mr. Bruemmer encountered people willing and able to make it for him. KSBW's Felix Cortez reported last month:</p><p>The good Samaritans were identified as Heath Braddock, a surfer from Moss Landing, Aimee Johns, a nurse from Folsom and her husband Paul Bandy, a Sacramento police officer. All were in the water that day and Bandy said he did what he's trained to do.</p><p>\"As a police officer I respond to emergencies all the time so I don't think there was ever a question of whether or not we were gonna go,\" Bandy said the day of the rescue. \"It's just how fast we were going to be able to get there.\"</p><p>***</p><p>'Strong Progressives Clearly Live in a Different World' Democrats are very popular these days among college-educated whites, writes Ruy Teixeira on Substack. The bad news for the party is that such voters constitute a large part of the progressive left, which seems to have less and less in common with the rest of the country.</p><p>Mr. Teixeira uses data from Echelon Insights to highlight differences of opinion:</p><p>America is not the greatest country in the world vs. America is the greatest country in the world. By 66 percent to 28 percent, strong progressives say America is not the greatest country in the world. By 70-23, Hispanics say the reverse and working class voters as a whole concur by 69-23.</p><p>... Racism is built into our society, including into its policies and institutions vs. Racism comes from individuals who hold racist views, not from our society and institutions. Strong progressives are very, very sure of America's systemic racism, endorsing the first statement by an amazing 94-6 margin. But Hispanics disagree, endorsing the second statement that racism comes from individuals by 58-36, as do working class voters by 57-33.</p><p>... Hard work and determination are no guarantee of success for most people vs. Most people who want to get ahead can make it if they're willing to work hard. Strong progressives don't evidence much faith in upper mobility, endorsing the first statement on the questionable efficacy of hard work by 88-12. Hispanic voters, on the other hand, embrace the view that hard-working people are likely to get ahead by 55-39, as do working class voters by 55-40.</p><p>***</p><p>A 'Reagan Moment' in Virginia? Dean Karayanis writes in the New York Sun:</p><p>The resignation of hundreds of Virginia state employees is emerging as a Reagan moment for Governor Youngkin. Like air traffic controllers 40 years ago, Virginia state employees have been reminded that they serve the people — and if they refuse to do so, they're free to find jobs elsewhere.</p><p>On May 5, Mr. Youngkin announced that on July 5, the Old Dominion's workforce would return to doing their jobs in person, face to face with the citizens who pay their salaries...</p><p>Those of us who have learned to stop worrying and love the couch during Covid-19 have two options if our company wants us back in cubicles: market our talents on LinkedIn or start a business and be our own boss.</p><p>Three-hundred Virginia employees chose options along those lines when the rules went back into effect. The state soldiers on with a smaller government until those positions need to be filled, if they ever do.</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Lisa Rossi helps compile Best of the Web.)</p><p>Of Sharks and Samaritans</p>",
