  "text": "<p>As Halloween approaches, it seems fitting that we are preparing a Working It podcast episode covering astrology and the occult at work. </p> <p>Astrology is now mainstream among younger workers: scroll through #astrologyatwork on TikTok for endless videos spoofing how different signs behave in the office (Capricorns are the grumpy ones, Leo and Sagittarius take credit for others' work). One in four US women aged 18-25 have downloaded the Co-Star astrology app, according to the company — which raised $15mn in 2021. </p> <p>But could adherence to astrology have negative implications for the workplace? There has been documented — as well as covert — discrimination in job hiring (“<a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/zodiac-shaming\">zodiac shaming</a>”) based on star signs.</p> <p>One FT colleague told me that in a previous job, a boss asked for everyone's signs in a team meeting — not to shame, just for fun. “We were very over-indexed on Geminis and Scorpios, which was interesting,” my co-worker said. </p> <p>Believers think there is solace and career guidance to be gained through invoking higher powers. I am open-minded — anything that helps is probably a good thing. Tarot reading is another way of storytelling using timeless human archetypes. When I had my tarot read by Jen Cownie and Fiona Lensvelt, a duo known as <a href=\"https://www.litwitchure.com/about\">Litwitchure</a>, I found that the cards offered helpful workplace advice (do less, let others help you). </p> <p>How would Fiona and Jen characterise the current state of the workplace, if it were a tarot card? “The wheel of fortune — a card that basically says everything is chaotic.” </p> <p>Do you use astrology to help make decisions and predictions at work? Have you come across “zodiac shaming”? Let us know in the comments below or write to us at <a href=\"mailto:workingit@ft.com\">workingit@ft.com</a>, and we will use your input in our forthcoming episode of Working It. </p> <p>Read on for Sophia's story on how high energy bills are influencing the evolution of WFH versus in-office work — as well as advice on dealing with a narcissist boss. <em>(Isabel Berwick)</em> </p> <h1>The energy crisis is affecting return-to-office sentiment</h1> <p>As the return-to-office debate rages on, more workers are factoring the rising costs of energy into whether they work from home or commute in.</p> <p>UK residents' utility bills could more than quadruple from <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/annual-domestic-energy-price-statistics#history\">last year</a> to next year, with the average annual cost <a href=\"https://www.cornwall-insight.com/cornwall-insight-comments-on-the-announcement-of-the-october-price-cap/\">expected to exceed £5,300</a> according to forecasts by Cornwall Insight. And Americans' utility bills were <a href=\"https://business.bofa.com/content/dam/flagship/bank-of-america-institute/economic-insights/consumer-morsel-high-energy-impact-september-2022.pdf\">16 per cent more expensive</a> this August compared to August of last year, according to a report by Bank of America.</p> <p>Several recent polls have found that these rising costs are dissuading employees from working from home. Nearly one in four UK employees <a href=\"https://resources.infogrid.io/story/energy-management-and-the-workplace-of-the-future-why-we-need-an-efficiency-revolution/page/1\">plan to work more from the office</a> this winter to cut down on home energy costs, and nearly two in five US employees have already increased their use of facilities outside their home, according to an Infogrid survey of more than 4,000 US and UK workers. Of another 900 hybrid workers in the UK polled by Instantprint, over a third cited <a href=\"https://www.instantprint.co.uk/think-big/growing-your-business/surge-of-hybrid-workers-head-back-to-the-office\">temperature control as a reason they were planning to commute</a> into the office.</p> <p>According to Infogrid, 74 per cent of Americans and <a href=\"https://resources.infogrid.io/story/energy-management-and-the-workplace-of-the-future-why-we-need-an-efficiency-revolution/page/1\">70 per cent of Brits are “concerned”</a> that the energy crisis will impact the cost of working from home.</p> <p>While it's increasingly costly to warm a house, workers must also consider the price of public transit or driving to work. A survey of 11,000 workers conducted by Mobilityways found that 61 per cent of UK commuters are <a href=\"https://www.mobilityways.com/insights/cost-of-living-and-commuter-trends/\">“very concerned” about rising fuel costs</a>.</p> <p>Some employers have experimented with ways to help their workers offset fuel costs. When US petrol prices peaked at <a href=\"https://gasprices.aaa.com/\">over $5 a gallon</a> in June, Chastity Lord — CEO of the non-profit Jeremiah Program — piloted a benefit in which she granted all of her hourly employees $200 a month in prepaid petrol cards. She says that she's seen some workers move further away from city centres in order to save on rent — only to be overwhelmed by a higher-than-anticipated cost of commuting. Kimberly Benford Johns, a teacher who benefited from the subsidy, said that it saved her from “having to take valuable resources from [her] family to compensate for rising gas and housing prices”.</p> <p>Besides employer-subsidised benefits, carpooling — either with coworkers or with neighbours who have similar commutes — is another solution that allows workers to cut down on home heating costs while also keeping commuting costs down. Mobilityway's <a href=\"https://www.mobilityways.com/liftshare-for-work/\">Liftshare for Work</a> is one such programme. In the San Francisco Bay Area, many commuters have relied on <a href=\"https://worksthatwork.com/7/casual-carpool-san-francisco\">the region's “casual carpool” system</a> for decades. </p> <p>As myriad factors play into workers' calculus on whether to work from home or the office (commute distance, the cost of heating their home, who else they live with, etc), businesses must also consider how rising energy costs impact their bottom line. While hybrid might be the new normal for many workers' day-to-day, the economics are far from settled. <em>(Sophia Smith)</em></p> <p><em><strong>Will the energy crisis affect where you work? (Or has it already?) Let us know in </strong></em><a href=\"https://compass.pressekompass.net/compasses/financial_times/will-the-energy-crisis-affect-where-you-\"><em><strong>this week's poll</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> <h1>Listen in: Narcissists at work</h1> <p>This week on the Working It podcast, we talk about <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/gPBKEPVr\">narcissists at work</a>. It's one of the great workplace fears. (Michael Skapinker's piece on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eab55621-5a6e-4176-bcb9-c451417db328\">how to handle narcissists in the workplace</a> has been one of the most popular articles this year in the FT's Work &amp; Careers section.)</p> <p>I am joined by two experts on workplace dynamics, <a href=\"https://doctor-ramani.com/\">Dr. Ramani Durvasula</a>, who helps people deal with narcissists, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/fa0b7767-42d9-3b71-a902-42d497c491a7\">Naomi Shragai</a>, FT contributor and author of <em>The Man Who Mistook His Job for His Life</em>. We pick through the do's and don'ts of dealing with a deeply toxic manager or senior corporate leader. You'll hear how confronting them or trying to outlast them is rarely a good idea. And we find out that there's a little narcissist dwelling in most of us at work. </p> <p>Next week we revisit one of our most popular episodes: can you run a company without managers? (<em>Isabel Berwick</em>)</p> <h1>Elsewhere in the world of work: </h1> <p><strong>1. ‘Big Brother' managers and the rise of productivity paranoia: </strong>The number of employers using data surveillance software to monitor employees has doubled since the start of the pandemic — but it's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92ebeaa8-ccec-4ad3-bab2-a6690013113a\">more likely to breed resentment than increase performance</a>, writes Rana Foroohar.</p> <p><strong>2. Workers embrace hybrid work as the new norm:</strong> Trips to the workplace are still <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91899837-0fc7-4fe8-9581-60517d85399b\">well below levels from early 2020</a>, and as of mid-October, office occupancy is at about half of what it was pre-pandemic.</p> <p><strong>3. Business books to read this month:</strong> FT editors recommend some of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8da8cda-bdb9-495c-9f6d-adb4ce39ed00\">the latest titles in the world of work and careers</a>, including reads on when to quit, why managers matter and how race affects workplace experiences for black people.</p> <p><strong>4. Skills shortage in the growing media industry: </strong>The film and TV industry is forecast to grow by up to 36 per cent by 2025. While this translates to thousands of new jobs, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50ebdaa8-7e78-4689-b1e6-516f4922432f\">the freelance model can appear inaccessible and off-putting</a> to potential workers.</p> <p><strong>5. Companies offer perks to offset cost of living crisis: </strong>As staff pressure employers to increase wages to match inflation and the rising costs of necessities, one-off bonuses or short-term <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd554f23-d411-4d14-b36e-ade4a05b792d\">monthly stipends to help offset the crisis</a> are becoming more common.</p> <h1>A word from the Working It community: </h1> <p>Reader <strong>Iain Stewart</strong>, who has spent 25 years running travel-tech company freetobook and also holds resume clinics for university students, shares his thoughts in response to last week's newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df73fc26-5740-437a-9c5d-2e6bab63d590\">authenticity in the workplace</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>My top request to students is to be authentic. Be self aware, analyse your roles in the work you've done and be honest about how they've impacted that work. Include mistakes and failures as well as challenges and successes. It's surprising how few students have anything in their resumes about their non-work lives . . . I usually find that's the interesting part. To me, authenticity is about wanting to understand who the person behind the one-dimensional page really is.</p> </blockquote> <p>And in response to Isabel's musings on long-term burnout, <strong>Philip Ross</strong>, CEO of UnGroup, pointed us to some interesting findings that UnGroup obtained from Microsoft 365 data, and which Philip expounds on in his new book <em>Unworking: The Reinvention of the Modern Office</em>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Two key indicators of risk of burnout are “collaboration hours” and “work day span” — as they both increase, the risk of burnout increases. There is a direct correlation that's measurable and predictable.</p>  <p>Other burnout risk factors include the time of day and out-of-hours responding to emails, the number of emails received/sent each day and the amount of back-to-back meetings. Taking breaks and time for deep work is crucial — the more breaks and deep work achieved, the more rewarding the work and the lesser risk of burn out.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Responses have been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p>Source: Isabel Berwick and Sophia Smith 2022 'The energy crisis could drive people back to the office' FT.com 26 October.
