  "text": "<p>The founder of Hopin, one of the fastest-growing tech startups ever, has sold about £100m of shares over the past year as the video conferencing company's valuation has rocketed.</p> <p>Johnny Boufarhat, who launched Hopin two years ago, has sold almost 17 per cent of his stake for between £96m and 130m, according to a Financial Times analysis of public filings. </p> <p>While founders selling their shares as they raise funds from investors is routine, the quick pace of Hopin's capital raises has allowed Boufarhat to sell shares faster than most.</p> <p>Hopin, which was founded shortly before the coronavirus pandemic, has raced to a $5.7bn valuation, raising <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/hopin-confirms-400m-raise-at-5-65b-valuation/\">$565m</a> from top-tier venture capital investors<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c79bc717-0c5b-43eb-8595-0073169a1728\"> scrambling</a> to invest in video conferencing as lockdowns around the world created a huge demand for remote-working technology. </p> <p>The company now has 660 employees in 45 countries and says that millions of people attend virtual events run on its platform each month.</p> <p>Investors including Andreessen Horowitz, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11834bc1-f9b3-43a8-b142-7e890d85a11e\">Tiger Global</a> and IVP have piled into the company in a series of rapid-fire funding rounds in 2020 and 2021. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/09/linkedin-invests-in-hopin-betting-on-post-pandemic-remote-events.html\">LinkedIn</a> is among the company's backers.</p> <p>On paper, Boufarhat, at 27, is Britain's <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/johnny-boufarhat-net-worth-sunday-times-rich-list-2wdtmd3cb\">youngest self-made billionaire</a>, according to The Sunday Times Rich List.</p> <p>His investors are effusive about Boufarhat's qualities. “Johnny will be one of the greatest founders that Europe has ever seen. [He has] one of the most brilliant strategic minds in the business. He's a truly category-defining leader,” said Harry Stebbings, a Hopin investor.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://d1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net/production/uploaded-files/12035150_cs01_2021-06-14-37bb540d-0878-4040-b61a-6b4b070ba002.pdf\">filing</a> on Monday at Companies House showed that Boufarhat has sold 16.6m shares since July 2020 in a series of transactions.</p> <p>The Financial Times cross-referenced those transactions with earlier filings that showed chunks of a share class owned solely by Boufarhat being converted into share classes owned by Hopin's outside investors.</p> <p>Other public filings detail the prices paid by investors for various classes of Hopin shares, which the FT used to arrive at a range for Boufarhat's share sales of £96m-£130m.</p> <p>Hopin did not comment.</p> <p>Investors in fast-growing startups <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3980a4a-2604-4a4d-9fd8-eb036060474a\">may prefer</a> a founder to sell some shares so they are not incentivised to seek an early sale of the company to turn their paper wealth into cash.</p> <p>Boufarhat has retained control of Hopin in spite of the sales and dilution from new issuances to outside investors with a class of shares that commands 20 votes a piece. All the other shares are one vote a piece.</p> <p>Such voting structures, which give outsized power to founders, are also common in venture-backed companies.</p> <p><em>kadhim@ft.com</em><br><br></p><p>Source: Kadhim Shubber and Tim Bradshaw in London 2021 'Hopin founder nets £100m in share sales' FT.com 15 June.
