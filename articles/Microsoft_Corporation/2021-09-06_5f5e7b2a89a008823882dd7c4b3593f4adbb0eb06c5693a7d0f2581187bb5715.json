While the number of children in US hospitals with Covid has increased, it remains a small share of the overall total.&#xa0;But with schools easing requirements for masks and social distancing, there is fresh nervousness.</p> <p>That has led to concern in other countries such as the UK, where there has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/181ea7fa-4db4-46d9-8bb1-252367420d3f\">a debate about the risks and benefits of vaccinating younger children</a> and the easing of tight restrictions that caused disruption when pupils tested positive.</p> <p>Neil Ferguson, professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial College London, warned <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8091c05-31fb-4a5b-9146-14dfa4348e39#post-c6425a8f-6131-4840-b8b8-27a42464f7f9\">England could have “a difficult few weeks” following the reopening of schools</a>.&#xa0;“The role of schools in Covid transmission is still . . . controversial and it's certainly true throughout this pandemic that children, young children have not been key drivers of transmission,” he said.</p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24a39617-4ed9-491d-9195-d68191927655\">Covid-19 has made fighting inequality more critical than ever</a>, argues Prof Ian Goldin at Oxford university. Access to vaccines varies sharply, and the economic consequences of the pandemic are more deadly than the virus itself, with 100m people&#xa0;pushed into extreme poverty&#xa0;and 118m more people facing chronic hunger.<br><br>APM Terminals, one of the world's largest port and terminal operators, has warned <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/747be2c8-7ee8-4ec3-9725-a2fdbebc937d\">only a slowdown in consumer demand could ease the global shipping and supply chain crisis</a> that is leaving shelves empty on the high street. Morten Engelstoft, chief executive, warned of a “vicious circle” of surging demand straining container groups, suppliers and logistics companies.</p> <p>Economists expect to get a first glimpse on Thursday of how the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3a545fe-d532-48d0-a66a-c8a3448ea249\">European Central Bank might wind down its €1.85tn pandemic emergency purchase programme</a> (PEPP), its flagship bond-buying policy to shield financial markets from the crisis, now economies are recovering.</p> <h1>Business</h1> <p>Marriott's chief executive has warned that the company is in a “fight for talent” as it tries to recruit 10,000 staff to its US hotels to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8acbe8d0-f1d0-4cb9-a15b-518a817455a4\">keep pace with a sharp rebound in bookings</a>.</p> <p>Dechra Pharmaceuticals, one of the biggest sellers of veterinary medicine, has emerged as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96f4a85d-b3f5-4942-b9c5-9e64c41f2a26\">a winner from the pandemic after spending by pet owners </a>helped drive its annual profits up by almost two-thirds.</p> <p>China's state-owned <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91cbc7ef-808d-448a-a832-2384f045dc35\">Sinopharm is developing a homegrown messenger RNA inoculation</a> for Covid-19, becoming one of the first big pharmaceutical groups in the country to pursue the technology to combat the disease. Recent studies show <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aaddc31b-415d-43d0-b314-bc89a8b860e0\">Moderna's version prompts a stronger immune response</a> than the rival mRNA vaccine from BioNTech/Pfizer, and that its effects wane more slowly.&#xa0;</p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f85b0ad0-e6a7-4aeb-b07e-f5716ec2e214\">European equities brightened </a>as investors bought in to the region's economic recovery and weaker-than-expected US jobs data took pressure off the US central bank to reduce the monetary stimulus that has boosted global markets through the pandemic era.<br><br>A frantic summer of dealmaking has put 2021 on track to break records, with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b955a75-55a4-4e13-b785-638b88bbfb0b\">almost $4tn of deals already agreed</a> since the start of the year, as companies rush to exploit cheap financing and bumper profits. Examples include Dell's&#xa0;$52bn spin-off&#xa0;of VMware,&#xa0;Grab's $40bn merger&#xa0;with a special purpose acquisition company, and Microsoft's decision to&#xa0;buy voice recognition&#xa0;pioneer Nuance for $16bn.</p> <p>In the 10 years running up to the pandemic, China accounted on average for almost half of global investment growth. With a shift to the “economics of self reliance” with the west's new focus on capital expenditure, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aee82c9e-0d4c-4533-a5b8-ce1983e989b9\">the world economy will not benefit as much</a>, says David Lubin, head of emerging markets economics at Citi.</p> <h1>The essentials</h1> <p>Bosses across the City of London are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83740583-7717-4aa3-babf-d880bccb1c85\">hoping that most staff will this month start to spend at least some of the time at their offices</a>, combining inducements such as social events and free food alongside policies that will insist on a minimum number of days' attendance. </p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p><em>DrEntertainment</em> responds to our article <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82199534-fce2-4b9e-8a5a-fca22321bbc3#comments-anchor\">Yoga, DJs and cash on offer as companies tempt staff back to the office</a></p> <blockquote>  <p>Option 1: Leave home early, spend money on a train, get hassled all day in the office, eat a rubbish lunch, miss out on putting my toddler to bed. Watch a talk by Nigel Owens.&#xa0;</p>  <p>Option 2: Relaxed morning with family, focused day of work, nice lunch, exercise, put kids to bed. No Nigel Owens.&#xa0;</p>  <p>Struggling with this one.&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>Faced with widespread differences in basic financial understanding within and among communities around the world, the FT has launched<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80480742-9853-4144-9c91-238021414bc8\"> a campaign to increase financial literacy and inclusion</a>. In a survey it conducted in the UK, less than half of 16-24 year-olds knew that the value of your money would be eroded if it earned 1 per cent and inflation was running at 2 per cent. </p> <p>Understanding more can lay down vital foundations for future prosperity — aiding people on to the property ladder, teaching them about risk and investment opportunity. Financial literacy is a passport to financial freedom. </p><p>Source: Andrew Jack 2021 'US schools delay in-person teaching' FT.com 6 September.
