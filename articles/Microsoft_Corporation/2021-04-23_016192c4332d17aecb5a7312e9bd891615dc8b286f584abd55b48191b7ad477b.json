  "text": "<h2>Ray Dalio: personality cult</h2> <p>Ray Dalio wants to get to know you better. The hedge fund manager this week put his name to the launch of an online quiz for people sorting. <a href=\"https://principlesyou.com/\">PrinciplesYou</a>, the press release explains, “combines rigorous psychometrics with years of insight derived from Dalio's experiences building the leading investment firm, Bridgewater Associates.”</p> <p>Bridgewater has long relied on personality testing both for recruitment and management. Dalio's memoir, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e39d8b88-97ad-11e7-8c5c-c8d8fa6961bb\"><em>Principles: Life and Work</em></a>, tells of how he designed Bridgewater's chain of command after convincing contemporaries including Bill Gates and Elon Musk to sit a test that codified their “shaper” qualities. Under the popular Myers Briggs system, Dalio identifies <a href=\"https://twitter.com/raydalio/status/1049447954531176448?lang=en\">as an ENTP</a>, the Debater type, which according to the website <a href=\"https://www.16personalities.com/entp-personality\">16personalities.com</a>, is a disposition he shares with Mark Twain, Celine Dion and The Joker.</p> <p>PrinciplesYou replaces Myers Briggs' acronyms with an “Archetype Archipelago” that distributes 24 personality types across nine islands. Helpers and Peacekeepers are grouped together on Givers Island. Across the Caring Sea is Advocate Atol, home to Coaches and Campaigners, etc. Website visitors orientate themselves via a quiz that rates their approval to several hundred statements along the lines of “people describe me as an inspiring leader” and “I am easily distracted”. </p> <p>Their agreement is by default to a privacy statement that allows the sharing of all user data with “current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership”, as well as with third parties in anonymised form. </p> <p>Before deciding on the name PrinciplesYou, did Dalio consider Myers Bridgewater? What about Cambridge Daliotica? The company had not responded to those questions by press time.</p> <h2>Pavel Maslovskiy: Panel beaten</h2> <p>Another twist in the long-running Russian soap opera that is Petropavlovsk. </p> <p>The story so far: Pavel Maslovskiy, co-founder of the London-listed gold miner, is awaiting trial on charges of embezzlement after three of the company's shareholders called on the FSB, the Russian intelligence agency, to investigate. Maslovskiy was removed last June by an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aaa3c0cc-f496-4e37-8744-52399d6c91ec\">alleged coup</a> backed by Konstantin Strukov, the owner of a rival miner UGC, whom Maslovskiy claims is trying to mount a takeover by stealth. </p> <p>Petropavlovsk said this week that the UK Takeover Panel has not found evidence to prove a concert party between UGC and other shareholders. It also revealed a new $66m loan from Gazprombank. </p> <p>Though Gazprombank was known to have lent money to Petropavlovsk's Hong Kong-listed subsidiary, IRC, news of the parent company loan will add to its deposed co-founder's sense of embattlement. Documents <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47bf77ff-6564-4372-af93-3f8029f97366\">seen by the FT</a> show that the chair of Gazprombank, Andrey Akimov, lodged a separate complaint to the FSB about Maslovskiy ahead of his arrest. </p> <h2>Jitse Groen: stand and deliver</h2> <p>Jitse Groen is working hard to become Europe's answer to Elon Musk. Not only does the Just Eat Takeaway chief executive pick fights on Twitter, his forthright approach has drawn the attention of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. </p> <p>Groen this week accused Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi of “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jitsegroen/status/1384779445106581505\">trying to depress our share price</a>” after the US group rolled out its food delivery service in Germany, one of Just Eat's key markets. </p> <p>In the back-and-forth that followed, Khosrowshahi <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dkhos/status/1384877230141046784\">told Groen</a> to “pay a little less attention to your short term stock price and more attention to your tech and ops.” Groen thanked him for the advice then offered <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jitsegroen/status/1384881272816869376\">some of his own</a>: “start paying taxes, minimum wage and social security premiums before giving a founder advice on how he should run his business.” Attention from the spat meant Groen added more than 1,000 Twitter followers in 24 hours. </p> <p>Next came a barb directed at the arbitrage traders seeking to reject Just Eat's all-share purchase of US peer Grubhub: the offer price is final so “try to keep up”, wrote Groen. Just Eat had to log the tweet <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594109/000095015721000444/form425.htm\">with the SEC</a> as a forward-looking statement.</p> <p>Groen's newfound fame coincided with his virtual appearance at <a href=\"https://collisionconf.com/\">Collision</a>, a technology conference that applies an all-encompassing definition of tech. Executives, venture capitalists and a surfeit of journalists speak alongside the likes of Paris Hilton (CEO and entrepreneur), David Beckham (Goodwill Ambassador, Unicef) and Cindy Crawford (Founder, Meaningful Beauty).</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Market wizard Dalio rummages inside the sorting hat' FT.com 23 April.
