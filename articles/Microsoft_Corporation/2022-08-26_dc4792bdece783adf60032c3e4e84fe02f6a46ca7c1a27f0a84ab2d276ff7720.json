  "text": "<p>The White House declined to comment. Mr. Biden has previously called Mr. Trump and his supporters \"ultra-MAGA\" in speeches.</p><p>Mr. Biden made the comments while talking about his concerns regarding democracy worldwide and what he described as an extreme GOP agenda.</p><p>\"Today there are 15 percent fewer democracies than there were 10 years agoâ€¦How do we sustain peace and stability if that's the case?\" he asked.</p><p>\"This is not your father's Republican Party. This is a different deal,\" Mr. Biden said.</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Trump didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Nathan Brand, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, called Mr. Biden's comments \"despicable,\" adding that the Democratic Party hasn't done enough to help Americans struggling with food and gas prices.</p><p>The roughly 100-person fundraiser was set to raise $1 million for the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee between the DNC and state party committees, according to a DNC official.</p><p>The president was scheduled to speak later Thursday at a DNC rally at a high school in nearby Rockville, Md., in what his advisers described as the kickoff of several weeks of campaigning ahead of the midterm elections.</p><p>Some Democratic strategists have urged Mr. Biden to more aggressively criticize Mr. Trump, whom they believe remains unpopular with certain swing voters.</p><p>Mr. Biden plans to travel the country more and make his criticism of Mr. Trump's agenda a key part of his message, aides said. He has, however, stayed silent on federal agents searching Mr. Trump's Florida home, declining to weigh in on the investigation into how the former president handled classified documents.</p><p>Mr. Biden has said he plans to seek re-election in 2024. Mr. Trump has said he is strongly considering another presidential bid and could announce as early as before the midterms.</p><p>Write to Andrew Restuccia at andrew.restuccia@wsj.com and Tarini Parti at Tarini.Parti@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Describes Trump's Governing Philosophy as 'Like Semi-Fascism'</p>",
