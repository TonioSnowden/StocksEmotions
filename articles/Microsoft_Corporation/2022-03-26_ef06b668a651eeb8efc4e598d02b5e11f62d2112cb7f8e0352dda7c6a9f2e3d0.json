  "text": "<p>\"All day every day, people were demanding Adderall,\" she said, adding that \"you can't diagnose people in a half hour.\" Cerebral said it encourages proper treatment and its clinicians aren't required to reach a diagnosis in a half hour. \"We simply want to make the right diagnosis and develop the right treatment plan for the safety and quality of care for each patient,\" it said.</p><p>Digital health startups that provide diagnoses and medications online for ADHD are following a familiar Silicon Valley playbook: They're using software and the internet to remove the friction surrounding a service that is in high demand. Instead of a ride or groceries, this time it's prescription drugs. Two of the most prominent new providers of these services for ADHD patients are Cerebral and Done Health, which now treat tens of thousands of patients online and have well-known supporters from the worlds of venture capital and sports.</p><p>How these companies are managing that demand has been the source of tension among workers trying to keep pace. Current and former employees said they felt Cerebral and Done applied pressure on clinicians to prescribe stimulants, and some of them said the companies' initial 30-minute video evaluations often weren't sufficient to diagnose ADHD. Cerebral and Done said that they don't pressure clinicians to prescribe stimulants and that they are providing an essential service in the U.S., where demand for mental-health treatment far outstrips supply. Bloomberg previously reported on complaints made by former staff at Cerebral.</p><p>Cerebral said its clinicians can schedule an unlimited number of appointments. Done said systems and software help complete its initial consultations within 30 minutes.</p><p>Psychiatrists lauded the companies' goal of expanding access to mental health services, and they said stimulants are beneficial to people who are properly diagnosed. Adderall and other stimulants can help ADHD patients improve their attention and focus by increasing certain chemicals such as dopamine in the brain, but the drugs can also produce euphoria, be used to get high and lead to dependence. Psychiatrists warn that some patients who shouldn't have access to the medications could get them if examinations aren't thorough. The drugs are classified by the federal government as \"Schedule 2\" controlled substances because they carry a high risk of abuse. Other Schedule 2 substances include cocaine, OxyContin and Vicodin.</p><p>\"There's a reason that we make it a little more complicated to access stimulants -- they can be abused and misused and routinely are,\" said Roy Perlis, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.</p><p>Cerebral and Done said their clinicians follow evidence-based guidelines for treatment and use questionnaires and self-reported medical histories that make it possible for clinicians to treat their needs in shorter video visits.</p><p>\"Our providers use their clinical judgment to decide on whether to prescribe stimulants to patients,\" said Done, which noted that it has a 20-person team dedicated to monitoring risk. \"Providers are educated to properly assess, diagnose, and then treat according to evidence-based practice and standards of care.\"</p><p>Cerebral said half the patients who approach the company with concerns that they have ADHD are ultimately diagnosed with the disorder, and that a \"single digit percentage\" of their patients have been given a controlled substance to treat ADHD.</p><p>\"We are not incentivized to give any specific diagnosis,\" said the company, which has a board that advises on clinical decisions. \"We simply want to make the right diagnosis and develop the right treatment plan for the safety and quality of care for each patient.\"</p><p>It is unclear how long telehealth providers will be able to prescribe stimulants to new patients without at least one in-person visit, which they are typically prohibited from doing. The U.S. relaxed those rules in March 2020 for all Schedule 2 substances because Covid-19 presented a public-health emergency. If the federal government decides that the emergency is over, the loosening of those rules would be reversed.</p><p>The rise of Cerebral and Done coincides with increasing demand for online health services and stimulants such as Adderall. Prescriptions of the medication dispensed in the U.S. jumped to 41.4 million last year, up 10% from 2020, according to Iqvia Holdings Inc., a data and research services provider for the pharmaceutical industry.</p><p>Both Done and Cerebral were founded just before the pandemic began in 2019. Cerebral initially treated depression, anxiety and insomnia before taking on more complex mental-health issues like bipolar disorder and ADHD last year. Cerebral said its founder and CEO, Kyle Robertson, didn't have a medical background, but his vision for the company came from his own struggles with depression and anxiety and a desire to eliminate barriers to high-quality mental-health care. He didn't comment for this article.</p><p>Cerebral raised nearly $500 million of venture capital from investors including SoftBank Group Corp. and Silver Lake, and signed up superstar U.S. gymnast Simone Biles as spokeswoman. Its annualized sales are already more than $150 million, according to people familiar with the figure. Cerebral declined to comment on its revenue. Softbank and Silver Lake declined to comment.</p><p>Cerebral also assembled a board of prominent medical figures who can offer advice on clinical decisions; it includes former National Institute of Mental Health Director Dr. Tom Insel.</p><p>\"It's amazing to me that a company just a little over two years old has already become one of the largest providers of mental-health care,\" Dr. Insel said.</p><p>Done focuses on ADHD treatment. Its founder was former Facebook product designer Ruthia He, whose previous startup made a smartphone app that allowed users to track their music streaming, according to Ms. He's LinkedIn profile. Done's investors include the venture firms of former Zenefits Inc. executive David Sacks and Hall of Fame football quarterback Joe Montana.</p><p>Cerebral spends millions of dollars a month for online ads on TikTok, Instagram and Google, according to people familiar with the figure. Done's advertising budget couldn't be learned. The social-media ads said ADHD can be associated with symptoms such as \"overthinking\" and \"losing track of time\" in the case of Done or \"mood swings\" and \"stress\" in the case of Cerebral. Cerebral's Instagram ads sometimes end with a shot of a pill bottle arriving in a package.</p><p>Cerebral and Done make money by charging patients on medication a monthly fee. Prescriptions for controlled substances such as Adderall are typically renewed monthly, so patients who want to continue their prescription must pay the recurring monthly fee.</p><p>A critical decision for both companies was how long initial patient appointments should be. One former employee who participated in the planning discussions at Cerebral surrounding ADHD diagnosis said other employees suggested the appointments be increased to 45 minutes from the company's typical 30-minute evaluations. This employee said the suggestion was rejected due to higher costs and disruptions to the company's scheduling protocol. The company said nurse practitioners can have more time beyond the 30-minute meeting if needed. \"We actively encourage clinicians not to rush to a diagnosis,\" the company said in a statement.</p><p>A 30-minute visit is much shorter than a typical diagnosis conducted in traditional psychiatric settings. Those appointments can take hours and involve detailed interviews and questionnaires, according to physicians specializing in ADHD treatment.</p><p>\"In 30 minutes, you can just barely hear what their main concern is, let alone get a history of all these other things,\" said Dr. Mark Stein, director of the ADHD and related disorders program at Seattle Children's Hospital.</p><p>Cerebral Chief Medical Officer Dr. David Mou said he couldn't confirm or deny any discussion of 45-minute appointments, but he said the company encourages nurse practitioners to schedule additional appointments to reach a diagnosis if they feel that is necessary. Dr. Mou recently sent a message to Cerebral clinicians that said the company is reviewing its protocols and training for prescribing ADHD, encouraging clinicians to use available resources for added consultation and adding surveys and other steps to improve the process.</p><p>Done also settled on an initial visit of roughly 30 minutes. Another digital health company that competes with Cerebral and Done also decided to do 30-minute visits, while other competitors went with longer appointments.</p><p>Done said systems and software help complete initial consultations within 30 minutes. \"While we would love to spend as much time as possible with our patients, we are also committed to helping as many patients as possible,\" the company said.</p><p>Former Done workers said prescribing stimulants to patients was strongly encouraged. One of those people said such encouragement came in the form of a \"Best Practices for Done Platform Use\" document provided to clinicians in 2020.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
