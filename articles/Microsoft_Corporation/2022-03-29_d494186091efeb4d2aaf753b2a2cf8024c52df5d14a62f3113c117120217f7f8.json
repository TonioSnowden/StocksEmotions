  "text": "<p>Noya's strategy is one way of removing carbon from the atmosphere -- a challenge many scientists say is essential for keeping global warming in check.</p><p>Shopify's latest agreements take its total funding since 2019 for carbon-removal projects to $32 million, said Stacy Kauk, director of the Ottawa-based company's sustainability fund.</p><p>These aren't huge sums for Shopify, which saw its sales rise 57% to $4.6 billion last year, but the company is a big player in this small but growing industry. Like a handful of other early adopters, including Microsoft Corp. and payments company Stripe Inc., Shopify says that by signing up to pay for new carbon-removal technologies, it can help unproven concepts blossom into an industry capable of dialing down the planet's thermostat.</p><p>High-tech carbon removal remains expensive. Ms. Kauk declined to say how much Shopify was paying Noya, but said it generally has paid an average of over $600 per metric ton of carbon dioxide for long-term carbon removal. At Shopify's average rate, the total cost would be above $870,000. Scientists say billions of tons would have to be removed every year to deliver a significant climate benefit.</p><p>The carbon-removal industry is evolving fast. About 200 companies entered Shopify's latest procurement round, according to Ms. Kauk, and nearly half of the 25 leading applicants were formed in the past three years. Of the nine startups Shopify is funding, \"We are the first purchaser for four of them, which tells you that there are new companies joining the ecosystem,\" she added.</p><p>The companies that Shopify is paying to remove carbon are approaching the challenge in various ways. DroneSeed Inc. uses seed-dropping drones to reforest areas devastated by wildfires. Some, such as Noya and Cary, N.C.-based Sustaera Inc., have systems that suck CO2 from the air. Others are addressing how to store the captured gas, such as 44.01 LLC -- the name refers to carbon dioxide's molecular mass -- which turns CO2 into rock. Some are looking into commercial applications, such as Los Angeles startup CarbonBuilt Inc., which is using CO2 captured from industrial processes in building materials.</p><p>Noya's system works by redirecting the airflow in a cooling tower into equipment containing a chemical compound that captures CO2. Co-founder and Chief Executive Josh Santos declined to name the chemical, but said it is \"easy to source and not something that is hazardous in any way.\"</p><p>The money from Shopify will let Noya, which is testing equipment at its headquarters, build a pilot facility, he said.</p><p>Mr. Santos, who previously worked for Harley-Davidson Inc. and Tesla Inc., said an advantage of Noya's system is that it uses cooling towers' existing air currents, without the need for new equipment to move the air. \"The installation costs will vary by geography and cooling-tower size but we expect them to be an order of magnitude cheaper than other approaches,\" he said.</p><p>Ms. Kauk said the growth of the market depends on more companies paying a premium to help nurture early-stage carbon-removal businesses so they can bring down costs, rather than offsetting their emissions with conventional carbon credits. Those can cost as little as a few dollars a metric ton but often come with questionable climate benefits.</p><p>There are signs of growing corporate appetite. Plane maker Airbus SE March agreed to buy 400,000 tons of carbon credits over four years from a unit of Occidental Petroleum Corp., which is building a carbon-capture facility in the Permian Basin in the Southwestern U.S., using technology from Carbon Engineering Ltd.</p>",
