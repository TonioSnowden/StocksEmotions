  "title": "Microsoft Puts On Its Game Face --- Results will reflect a big quarter for its Xbox line",
  "text": "<p>Microsoft announced a series of price changes for its Xbox Live service on Friday, which would have effectively doubled the annual rate for new subscribers while allowing existing ones to shift their memberships to the company's Game Pass service at no extra charge. But an outcry from gamers caused the company to backtrack: Microsoft said on Friday night that it will keep prices the same for Xbox Live Gold members.</p><p>The original move seemed to please investors as much as it irked gamers, sending Microsoft shares up Friday. Videogames were once derided on Wall Street as an expensive distraction for Microsoft, but it doubled down, continuing to update its Xbox consoles while investing more in software and services.</p><p>The launch of the new Xbox consoles in November makes this year a big one for the videogame business. The company's game revenue totaled $11.4 billion in the fiscal year ended last June, and analysts are expecting a jump of 17% for the current fiscal year, according to Visible Alpha.</p><p>But consoles are a low-margin business compared with software. The recent launch of both the new Xbox devices and the PlayStation 5 from competitor Sony have been marred by production constraints that both companies are working to address. Analysts expect operating margins for the segment that includes Microsoft's videogame business to fall to 27% for the December quarter compared with 32% a year earlier, according to FactSet.</p><p>Investors will likely forgive the short-term margin pressure, especially if the company's larger and more vital cloud-computing venture continues to post solid growth. Gamers also would have likely gotten past the price bumps, considering that many now have invested years of playing time on the Xbox platform. Both constituencies should understand well by now that when it comes to this business, Microsoft isn't playing games.</p>",
