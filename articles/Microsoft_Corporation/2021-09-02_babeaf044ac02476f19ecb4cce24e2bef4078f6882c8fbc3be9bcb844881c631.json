  "text": "<p>Ms. Bradford, who started in the role in mid-August, is charged with accelerating growth internationally and inking new partnerships across media, agency and technology companies, said MNTN Chief Executive Mark Douglas.</p><p>\"The goal is really to bring television [ads] and the ability to buy TV ads to everybody on a performance basis,\" said Ms. Bradford.</p><p>Marketers are increasing the amount of money they spend on streaming TV as consumers shift from traditional broadcast and cable TV to streaming subscriptions with companies such as Netflix Inc. and ad-supported streaming services such as Walt Disney Co.'s Hulu and ViacomCBS Inc.'s Pluto TV.</p><p>In addition to helping clients advertise on internet-connected TVs, Mr. Douglas wants to expand MNTN's creative capabilities such as creating entertaining videos that promote a client's brand, he said. The company recently acquired actor Ryan Reynolds's agency Maximum Effort. And MNTN, which generated more than $100 million in 2020 and is profitable, also is planning to acquire a business in the coming weeks that will bring more efficiency to the creative production process, he said.</p><p>\"In the current model in TV, media and creative are separate,\" he said. \"We want to bring media and creative much closer together.\"</p><p>Ms. Bradford, an executive whose experience spans marketing and broader business functions, was most recently president of e-commerce and rewards company Honey Science Corp., which was acquired by PayPal Holdings Inc. She previously served as chief operating officer and chief marketing officer at SoFi Technologies Inc., and also held senior roles at Pinterest Inc., Yahoo Inc. and Microsoft Corp.</p><p>MNTN in 2016, when it was known as SteelHouse, became embroiled in a legal battle with advertising-technology company Criteo in which each company accused the other of engaging in bad behavior to boost performance. The companies eventually settled their dispute.</p><p>The company rebranded to MNTN this year as it shifted its focus from traditional online advertising strategies such as retargeting—serving ads to people who visited a brands' website—to performance marketing for internet-powered connected TVs.</p><p>Write to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com</p><p>Ryan Reynolds's Ad Shop Parent Taps Marketing Vet Joanne Bradford</p>",
