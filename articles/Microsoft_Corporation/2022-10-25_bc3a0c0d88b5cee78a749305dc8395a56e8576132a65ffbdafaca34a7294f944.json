  "text": "<p>Having tumbled for months on fears about rising interest rates and soaring inflation, stocks have shot higher in recent days as earnings from big financial firms cheered investors. Meanwhile, hopes have built that the Federal Reserve could be approaching a point at which it feels comfortable easing the pace of its interest rate increases.</p><p>Fed officials are expected to raise interest rates by another 0.75 percentage point next week, but are also expected to debate a smaller increase toward the end of the year, offering investors hope that the worst could be behind them.</p><p>\"It would be prudent here for policy makers to step on the brake a little bit. It would be prudent to signal that they aren't going to let financial conditions get too tight,\" said Brian O'Reilly, head of market strategy at Mediolanum International Funds.</p><p>Meanwhile, stock valuations are beginning to look attractive again after tumbling for most of the year, Mr. O'Reilly said. \"We are getting close to the market fully pricing in a recession,\" he said.</p><p>Investors are turning their attention to megacap technology firms, which are set to report earnings that could offer a barometer of the U.S. consumer. Higher interest rates which proved to be a boon for bank earnings could have the opposite effect on interest rate-sensitive tech firms.</p><p>Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Spotify are set to report results after markets close, setting the tone for a week of tech earnings with Apple, Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Amazon.com due to report later in the week.</p><p>\"As the Federal Reserve continues to tighten, with a further 75-basis-point rate rise expected from next week's policy meeting, the tech sector looks especially vulnerable,\" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note.</p><p>In premarket trading, General Electric rose 1.7% as it outlined plans to cut costs. General Motors rose 3.2% after reporting earnings that were ahead of forecasts.</p><p>3M shares fell 2.9% after the sticky-note maker reported lower profits and warned of an \"uncertain macroeconomic environment.\" Coca-Cola and United Parcel Service rose 2% and 2.4% respectively after reporting earnings that beat forecasts.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, edged down 0.4% to $90.84 a barrel. Gold prices declined 0.6%.</p><p>The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note edged down to 4.106% from 4.231% on Monday, which was its highest closing level since 2008. Yields on U.K. government debt also edged lower on hopes that new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak would restore some of the nation's economic stability.</p><p>Overseas, Chinese stock indexes ended the day flat after volatile moves that followed President Xi Jinping breaking with tradition and securing a third term as China's leader. The Hang Seng inched down 0.1% while the Shanghai Composite closed mostly flat.</p><p>Elsewhere, Japan's Nikkei 225 was an outperformer in Asia, rising 1%. In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 was flat as gains for media firms were balanced by losses among banks.</p><p>HSBC fell 6.2% in London after reporting a drop in quarterly profit and issuing a cautious outlook.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Waver Amid Earnings Stampede</p>",
