  "text": "<p><em>Michael Skapinker is an FT contributing editor and author of ‘Inside the Leaders' Club: How Top Companies Manage Pressing Business Issues'</em></p> <p>FT Weekend has a feature called Fantasy Dinner Parties in which writers select guests for their dream meal. Imagine a fantasy dinner party with Bill Gates, Emma Thompson, George Galloway, Barack Obama and Donald Trump. This strange gathering would not make for peaceful eating. The guests have little in common — except that they are all Baby Boomers, the generation born between 1946 and 1964.</p> <p>That was a time when the US and Europe moved from postwar reconstruction to growing prosperity and witnessed the stirrings of feminism, the arrival of the contraceptive pill and the start of the Vietnam war. Yet each of our dinner guests drew their own conclusions and went their radically different ways.</p> <p>This is something we need to remember when we generalise about generations — Boomers, Generation X, Millennials, Generation Z — and their attitudes to life and work. It is fun to talk about their differences: their ease or haplessness with technology and their attitudes to gender fluidity.</p> <p>And as many organisations today have staff aged 18 to 70, managing a multigenerational workforce has become one of the key leadership tasks addressed in my new book <em>Inside the Leaders' Club</em>.</p> <p>But because the differences within generations are often as great as those between them, how to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/management\">manage</a> the age cohorts requires more subtlety than simply ensuring Gen Z and Boomers learn to tolerate each other.</p> <p>Take a real-life example, rather than my contrived dinner party. I moderated a strategy session earlier this year for the leadership group of a European manufacturing company. Several of the executive team mentioned that potential recruits often demanded to know how the company justified its existence. What was its purpose? Young interviewees made it clear that if the company couldn't explain how it contributed to society, they would go elsewhere.</p> <p>While the leaders discussed this, I noticed one of the participants becoming irritated. All this talk of purpose might be true of those applying for positions in research and development, HR, sustainability or communications, he said, but 80 per cent of his company's employees spent their days in front of a machine in a factory — and their purpose was having a job that paid enough for them to live on.</p> <p>Managing these tensions requires a detailed assessment of what each cohort is doing in your own organisation. Widespread problems in society will affect your company differently. For example, housing is an issue for many young workers. A 2020 Loughborough university report found that two in three single British people in their twenties were living with their parents. In the US, the Pew Research Center reported in 2020 that a majority of 18 to 29-year-olds — 52 per cent — were living with their parents for the first time since the Great Depression, a trend exacerbated by the pandemic.</p> <p>What does this mean for your workforce? Are your new jobs open only to those with parents who live in your company's location — because others can't afford to move there? What does that do to your ability to attract those best suited to the job? Would hybrid or flexible working mean you could recruit people from further afield who could come into the office three days a week? If, like the manufacturing company's factory staff, they need to be there every day, how could you ease their transport and housing costs, or should you build your next factory where labour is more plentiful?</p> <p>During the pandemic, many parents with young children found working from home impossible. If they had their own living space, a two-bedroom flat with toddlers left many longing for the office. But as much as they wanted to get out of their apartments, many couldn't afford the childcare to manage it — which you may have to help with if you are to keep them.</p> <p>The same applies at the other end of the age range. With labour shortages in industries from aviation to hospitality to construction, it makes sense to retain and recruit older employees. Yet many older workers have left the workforce. Older staff were more likely to be made redundant during the pandemic and less likely to be re-employed, according to the London-based Centre for Ageing Better. Again, we can't generalise. There are large differences, particularly for men. In England, male employment for 50- to 64-year-olds is 66.4 per cent in the North East and 80.4 per cent in the South East. The pool of potential older workers and your ability to attract them depends on your location.</p> <p>So generational differences do matter — but how they affect your organisation depends on what it does and where you are. Multigenerational management calls for nuanced analysis rather than snappy labels.</p><p>Source: Michael Skapinker 2022 'Generation game: managing age cohorts requires subtlety' FT.com 15 August.
