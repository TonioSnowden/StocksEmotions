  "title": "Citadel CEO Ken Griffin Outbid a Group of Crypto Investors for Copy of U.S. Constitution; The 53-year-old billionaire paid $43.2 million for the historic document; he plans to lend it to a museum in Arkansas",
  "text": "<p>Over the years, he's also collected pieces by Paul Cézanne, Willem de Kooning, Gerhard Richter, Edgar Degas and Njideka Akunyili Crosby.</p><p>With this Constitution buy, Mr. Griffin has suddenly risen to the upper echelons of historic-documents collectors. Others include Microsoft Corp.'s co-founder Bill Gates, who owns a $30.8 million copy of Leonardo da Vinci's scientific notebook known as the Codex Leicester. In 2007, Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein paid $21.3 million for a copy of the 1297 Magna Carta.</p><p>The fate of the Constitution matters because this six-page, first edition of the Constitution's final text, which starts out, \"We the people,\" was printed for delegates at the Constitutional Convention and for the Continental Congress more than 230 years ago. More than 27 first printings of the Declaration of Independence survive, but only 13 original copies of the Constitution are still around.</p><p>Mr. Griffin, who started his initial trading business from his Harvard University dorm room as a freshman, is well-known in art circles. He sits on the boards of several museums, including the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago and New York's Whitney Museum of American Art. He also has a wing named after him at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.</p><p>In 2006, he made a splash when Los Angeles music producer David Geffen confirmed that Mr. Griffin paid him $80 million for Jasper Johns's 1959 \"False Start\"—the most expensive sale at the time for any work by a living artist. Last year, Mr. Griffin's spokesman confirmed to Bloomberg that he paid $100 million for a wall-size work by Jean-Michel Basquiat from 1982, \"Boy and Dog in a Johnnypump,\" which Mr. Griffin later lent to the Art Institute of Chicago.</p><p>Write to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.com</p><p>Citadel CEO Ken Griffin Outbid a Group of Crypto Investors for Copy of U.S. Constitution</p>",
