The company that made its name by providing cloud-based software has expanded its offering, including through a series of acquisitions.</p><p>The company earlier this year closed its $27.7 billion acquisition of Slack Technologies Inc., the company that runs a workplace collaboration application.</p><p>The deal came after Salesforce acquired Tableau Software Inc., a data analytics platform, for $15.7 billion in 2019.</p><p>The Slack acquisition intensifies Salesforce's push to provide a broader set of business software and adds to the company's rivalry with Microsoft Corp., which offers its own workplace collaboration tool, Teams, launched in 2016.</p><p>Slack filed an antitrust complaint with the European Union last year, alleging that Microsoft was using its dominance to push Teams.</p><p>Microsoft at the time said that because of the pandemic, \"the market has embraced Teams in record numbers while Slack suffered from its absence of videoconferencing.\"</p><p>Write to Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com</p><p>Salesforce Names Bret Taylor Co-CEO</p>",
