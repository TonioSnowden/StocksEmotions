  "title": "Guggenheim Securities Hires Orcun Unlu Away From Citigroup; The executive will be in charge of establishing a private-funds advisory business",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Unlu initially will help set up a team of investment professionals for the new business, which will advise fund sponsors on primary and secondary transactions, including sponsor-led continuation funds, the person said. Mr. Unlu will join Guggenheim Securities this spring and will report to Mark Van Lith, the unit's chief executive.</p><p>This is Guggenheim's second attempt at launching a private markets advisory service. In 2020, the firm lured several professionals from other companies to set up a secondaries advisory operation.</p><p>Those hires included Matthew Wesley and Joseph Slevin from investment bank PJT Partners Inc., Benjamin Carper from asset manager Lazard Ltd. and Richard Saltzman from private-markets secondary adviser Houlihan Lokey. They left within several months to join the advisory business at investment bank Jefferies Financial Group Inc.</p><p>Guggenheim subsequently \"revisited its thinking\" about the kind of advisory business it wanted, the person said, adding that Mr. Unlu is expected to drive a new strategy focused on private-equity firms that invest in midsize businesses and larger firms that invest in bigger companies where Guggenheim has relationships.</p><p>Mr. Unlu began his career in 2008 at Citi in its Alternative Investments division, helping restructure it, including through secondary deals involving private equity assets when the bank decided to wind down the division, according to his LinkedIn page.</p><p>Mr. Unlu left Citi in April 2016 to work for Swiss bank UBS Group AG in its private funds group, advising on secondary transactions. He returned to Citi in September 2017 and founded its private-equity secondary advisory business, which merged with the bank's institutional fund distribution team to form its private funds advisory business, his LinkedIn page shows.</p><p>Guggenheim joins a growing list of asset managers and financial institutions that have set up private-markets advisory teams focused on secondary deals, as the volume of trades involving secondhand private assets rose to record levels in 2021.</p><p>Overall private-market secondary deal volume ranged from $132 billion to more than $143 billion last year, according to various estimates from firms that advise on such deals. According to a report from investment bank Evercore Inc., secondary transactions totaled $60 billion in 2020 and $80 billion in 2019.</p><p>Some investment banks, including Jefferies, Lincoln International LLC and Moelis &amp; Co., hired talent from rivals to build out their teams. Others like Raymond James Financial Inc. and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. acquired small boutique shops. In January, Mizuho Americas, a unit of Japanese banking giant Mizuho Financial Group Inc., agreed to acquire private-equity placement agent and advisory firm Capstone Partners LP.</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com</p>",
