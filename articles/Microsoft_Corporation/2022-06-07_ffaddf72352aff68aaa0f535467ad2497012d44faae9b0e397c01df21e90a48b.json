It technically began on June 1, but theQueen's Jubilee created a shorter work week, so the program will officially take effect the week of June 6.</p><p>As part of the program, employees will work 80% of their normal hours for the week (now 32 hours instead of 40 hours), but receive 100% of their usual pay. One of the goals of the program will be to find out if workers can maintain the same level of productivity while working fewer hours; another goal will be to find out if it will boost employees' overall quality of life.</p><p>\"As we emerge from the pandemic, more and more companies are recognizing that the new frontier for competition is quality of life, and that reduced-hour, output-focused working is the vehicle to give them a competitive edge,\" Joe O'Connor, chief executive of 4 Day Week Global, said in a statement.</p><p>See also: 1 in 3 Americans earning $250,000 or more say they live paycheck to paycheck — are they really?</p><p>Researchers at Cambridge University, Boston College and Oxford University will be analyzing the findings from the program, 4 Day Week Global claimed.</p><p>\"We'll be analyzing how employees respond to having an extra day off, in terms of stress and burnout, job and life satisfaction, health, sleep, energy use, travel and many other aspects of life,\" Juliet Schor, a sociology professor at Boston College and the researcher on the project, told the New York Times.</p><p>Iceland conducted a similar four-day work week program in 2015 that involved 2,500 workers — about 1% of Iceland's working population — that was dubbed an \"overwhelming success\" by some researchers as analysis indicated no significant drops on productivity and lower amounts of stress and burnout among workers, according to BBC report.</p><p>In a May episode of its Best New Ideas in Money podcast, MarketWatch examined if the U.S. could ever really get a four-day work week.</p><p>See also: Don't get fooled by another 'rip' says this strategist who advises watching this 'battleground' S&amp;P 500 level</p><p>In the past, U.S.-based companies including Microsoft MSFT and Shake Shack have experimented with a four-day work week with some success — Microsoft said productivity jumped 40% while employees worked four days a week. That test was conducted in 2019, but Microsoft didn't subsequently implement a permanent four-day work week.</p><p>According to a 2019 report from Henley Business School, 63% of businesses claimed a four-day work week helped them attract and retain talent.
