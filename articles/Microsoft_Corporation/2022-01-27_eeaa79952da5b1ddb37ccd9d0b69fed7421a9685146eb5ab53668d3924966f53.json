Yields move inversely to prices.</p><p>The Fed's statement noted the continued spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, saying that \"the path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus.\" U.S. data showed daily average deaths from the disease exceeding the peak of the Delta variant.</p><p>Investors are also monitoring rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine that have drawn the focus of NATO allies.
