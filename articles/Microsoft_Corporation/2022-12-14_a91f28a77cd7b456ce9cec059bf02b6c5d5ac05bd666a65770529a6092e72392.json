  "text": "<p>Group14 recently received a $100 million grant from the U.S. Energy Department through last year's infrastructure bill. It raised $400 million earlier this year from investors including Porsche AG, Riverstone Holdings and a joint venture between BlackRock Inc. and Singapore state-owned investor Temasek Holdings Ltd. The latest funding round values Group14 above $3 billion.</p><p>The Woodinville, Wash.,-based company says its silicon anode material is more efficient than existing graphite technology, potentially fueling more powerful batteries for auto makers such as Porsche. Industry executives say silicon batteries should help enable ultrafast charging, another key step toward increasing adoption of electric cars.</p><p>Group14 says its existing commercial factory in Washington puts it ahead of other startups trying to scale similar technology, such as Sila Nanotechnologies Inc., Enovix Corp. and Amprius Technologies Inc.</p><p>Sila also received $100 million from the Energy Department recently and raised about $600 million from investors including T. Rowe Price Group Inc. last year. Enovix and Amprius recently went public through special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs.</p><p>Founded in 2015, Group14 plans to use the new funding to accelerate development of a larger manufacturing facility in central Washington that will produce material for batteries capable of powering at least 100,000 electric cars.</p><p>\"The industry recognizes that this is happening and they can either participate or watch it happen without them,\" Group14 Chief Executive Rick Luebbe said in an interview.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is the future for battery manufacturing in the U.S.? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Many companies and investors are putting money into the sector and hoping to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, which tied tax credits for electric cars to how much of the material comes from domestic sources or trade partners. The legislation has spurred battery-factory investments of billions of dollars from industry titans such as Toyota Motor Corp. and upstarts such as Freyr Battery.</p><p>China and other countries dominate the production of battery materials, prompting Group14 and others to attempt to play catch-up to feed manufacturing facilities.</p><p>Brandon Middaugh, director of Microsoft's climate fund, said the company considered roughly 30 to 40 investments in the sector before putting money into Group14.</p><p>Group14's material can easily replace or work alongside graphite, allowing it to be integrated into existing battery supply chain, which should help the company grow more quickly, she said.</p><p>\"There's a clear pathway to scale,\" she said. \"And this industry really needs it.\"</p><p>Write to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft Invests in Silicon-Battery Material Upstart</p>",
