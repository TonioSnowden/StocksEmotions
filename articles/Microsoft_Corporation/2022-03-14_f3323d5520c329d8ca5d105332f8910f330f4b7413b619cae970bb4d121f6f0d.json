  "text": "<p>But Take-Two's long-term projection for the combined company that was issued during the deal's announcement also sent a strong signal about its existing business, which is mostly reliant on games made for the Xbox and PlayStation consoles. That was further affirmed by the company's S-4 filing on Monday, in which Take-Two projected that its stand-alone net bookings would surge 34% to $5.2 billion in the fiscal year ending March of 2024.</p><p>Such a jump would come only from one of the company's few major game franchises—and none of those is larger than \"Grand Theft Auto.\" The last full sequel—\"Grand Theft Auto V\"—came out in 2013, but the franchise continues to be one of Take-Two's top moneymakers. Analysts expect sales of games from the series to total nearly 20 million units for the fiscal year ending this month, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The online version of the game is projected to generate about $666 million in recurring revenue for the same period.</p><p>Rockstar Games, the developer behind the franchise, confirmed in a tweet last month that \"active development for the next entry in the series is under way.\" In a note to clients in January following the initial deal announcement, Doug Creutz of Cowen said Take-Two's initial projection for the combined company's financial performance implied about $5 billion in net bookings for Take-Two alone in fiscal 2024, which \"management could not promise that with any degree of certitude unless they also assume that GTA 6 is launching.\"</p><p>Big games also require big budgets. In a note Monday following the latest filing, Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird also pointed to the company's projected drop in adjusted pretax earnings in fiscal 2023, \"which we assume reflects ramping up headcount and expenses ahead of major title launches,\" he wrote.</p><p>It won't be smooth sailing up to that point. Take-Two also projected a 5% drop in net bookings for the fiscal year ending later this month and a 15% gain in fiscal 2023—both of which were below Wall Street's forecasts. The stock slipped 7% Monday following the filing.</p><p>But the company also issued relatively sunny projections for Zynga, which is expected to average 16% annual bookings growth over the next three years compared with Wall Street's current projected average of 9% growth. That suggests the mobile game maker won't be permanently hobbled by the changes to Apple's mobile operating system that hurt its user acquisition in the later half of last year and—ironically—led to the stock slide that gave Take-Two an opening to make the deal. With Zynga's net bookings projected to nearly equal those of Take-Two in the coming fiscal year, the combined company will have a lot more to talk about until the next Grand Theft Auto comes around.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Take-Two Plays the Very Long Game</p>",
