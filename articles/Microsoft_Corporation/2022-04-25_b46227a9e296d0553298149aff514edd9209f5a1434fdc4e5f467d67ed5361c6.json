  "title": "Activision Blizzard Revenue Falls as Call of Duty Demand Sputters; The videogame developer reports lower quarterly profit and sales as it works to finalize an acquisition deal with Microsoft",
  "text": "<p>Microsoft agreed to buy the videogame developer for $95 a share in a bid to expand its catalog of blockbuster videogames and drive more customers to its cloud-gaming service. Microsoft valued the deal at nearly $69 billion after adjusting for Activision's net cash. The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies and would make Microsoft the world's third-largest game company by sales.</p><p>For the quarter ended March 31, Activision posted a profit of $395 million, down from $619 million in the year-earlier quarter. In addition to tepid demand for its Call of Duty titles, Activision said it took a hit due to the product cycle timing for its Warcraft franchise, along with increased legal fees and other costs associated with the Microsoft acquisition.</p><p>Excluding one-time items, adjusted earnings for the quarter fell to 64 cents a share, down from 98 cents in 2021. Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting earnings of 71 cents a share.</p><p>Sales were $1.77 billion for the quarter, short of analysts' expectations of $1.82 billion.</p><p>The acquisition is slated to close in mid-2023.</p><p>Microsoft announced plans to buy Activision as the company was being roiled by claims of workplace misconduct. Its chief executive, Bobby Kotick, had known about various sexual-misconduct accusations for years, The Wall Street Journal previously reported, though he didn't inform the board about everything he knew. The issues prompted lawsuits and federal investigations.</p><p>Mr. Kotick has said he has been transparent with the company's board, and Activision has called the Journal's reporting \"misleading.\"</p><p>Last week, the company said it plans to add two women to its board of directors.</p><p>Activision Blizzard Revenue Falls as Call of Duty Demand Sputters</p>",
