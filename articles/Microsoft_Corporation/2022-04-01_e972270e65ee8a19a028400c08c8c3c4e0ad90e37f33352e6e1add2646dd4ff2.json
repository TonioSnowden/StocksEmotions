  "title": "Alex Mandl, Who Gave Up a Top AT&T Job to Lead a Startup, Has Died at Age 78; Austrian-born executive failed to turn Teligent into a winner but later ran a smart-card company and was lead director at Dell",
  "text": "<p>Alex Mandl was a leading contender for the chief executive job at AT&amp;T Corp. in 1996 when he defected to head a wireless-telecommunications startup that became Teligent Inc.</p><p>His $20 million signing bonus drew comparisons to the basketball star Michael Jordan.</p><p>The Austrian-born executive gave up his plum AT&amp;T job because he had always wanted to build a business from scratch. Heading a startup, he said, was \"the most exciting thing to do.\"</p><p>Teligent had ambitious plans to undercut prices of traditional phone companies by setting up a microwave network that would beam voice and data to business users via rooftop antennas. But Teligent had technical problems, losses piled up and investors fled. Mr. Mandl resigned as chief executive in April 2001, shortly before the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</p><p>Sixteen months later, he was commuting to Europe as chief executive of Gemplus International SA, a supplier of smart cards used in wireless phones and financial applications. He shaped up that troubled company, which merged with Axalto to form Gemalto NV in 2006.</p><p>As lead director of Dell Inc., he was in the thick of negotiations with Michael Dell and other parties when Mr. Dell took the computer company private in 2013.</p><p>Mr. Mandl died March 25 of congestive heart failure. He was 78.</p><p>Colleagues described him as a consensus builder who dressed impeccably and relished a sumptuous meal, even when it involved business discussions.</p><p>In its early days, Teligent attracted financial backing from Microsoft Corp. and Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp., among others. Amid the tech euphoria of the late 1990s, investors and lenders lavished money on startups. When the tech bubble collapsed, Teligent and others were running out of cash and couldn't raise enough money to avoid bankruptcy court.</p><p>\"There's a lot of disbelief and shock at how things have changed,\" Mr. Mandl told The Wall Street Journal in April 2001. He hadn't exercised his Teligent stock options when that would have been profitable because he would have needed to sell shares to pay capital-gains taxes on the income. A CEO selling shares would have sent a negative signal.</p><p>\"With hindsight,\" he said, \"some peopleâ€¦might say that wasn't the smartest move.\"</p><p>A few months later, he told Fortune magazine: \"I've clearly never experienced anything like this, and frankly, I don't want to experience anything like that again. We built a terrific base, and to watch that slipping away is a very painful and very stressful experience.\"</p><p>Alexander Johannes Mandl was born Dec. 14, 1943, in Vienna. When he was a teenager, the family moved to Ojai, Calif., where his father took a job as a school headmaster. His early jobs included selling books door-to-door, pumping gasoline and working in a menswear store.</p><p>Mr. Mandl earned an economics degree at Willamette University in Salem, Ore., and an M.B.A. degree at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>After graduating from Berkeley in 1969, he joined Boise Cascade Corp., a maker of paper and building materials, where he worked as a merger-and-acquisition analyst and later as assistant treasurer.</p><p>He moved to Florida in 1980 to join Seaboard Coast Line Industries Inc., which soon merged with Chessie System to form CSX Corp., where Mr. Mandl became a senior vice president. In 1988, CSX promoted him to chief executive of its SeaLand unit, an operator of container ships.</p><p>AT&amp;T recruited him in 1991 as chief financial officer and in 1995 promoted him to president. He led negotiations on the company's $12.6 billion purchase of McCaw Cellular Communications Co. in 1993. He did some of that negotiating while hiking near Vail, Colo.</p><p>He is survived by his wife, Susan Loughridge Mandl, and a daughter, Melanie Mandl. An earlier marriage ended in divorce.</p><p>One of the people he promoted while at AT&amp;T was Gail McGovern, now chief executive of the American Red Cross. \"I would not be in this role if I did not have a mentor like Alex,\" she said.</p><p>Write to James R.
