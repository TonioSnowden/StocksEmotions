  "title": "Microsoft to Disclose Pay Ranges for All U.S. Job Postings; Software giant's move comes after home state adopts pay transparency law",
  "text": "<p>The move comes after its home state of Washington adopted a law earlier this year requiring such disclosures on job postings starting next year. The new rules, which apply to companies with at least 15 employees, also mandate a description of benefits and other compensation available to job candidates.</p><p>A similar law went into effect in Colorado in 2021 and other states have adopted such requirements. New York City adopted a similar measure that is expected to take effect in November.</p><p>\"Companies are very concerned about complying with the growing patchwork of state and local statutes,\" said Jen Rubin, an employment attorney with the law firm Mintz. \"These days, especially in a post-pandemic economy, they may have employees in all 50 states, and it becomes a real challenge administratively to comply with all the laws, so Microsoft is kind of getting ahead of that wave of salary transparency laws.\" Ms. Rubin's firm doesn't represent Microsoft.</p><p>A bill making its way through the California legislature would require companies with 15 employees or more to list pay ranges on job postings. The bill passed in the California Senate last month. It also requires employers to submit a pay data report listing the median and hourly rate by race, ethnicity and sex within each job category; the state would then publish the reports of many employers to the public.</p><p>Proponents of the laws say they are aimed at addressing gender-pay gaps and providing more transparency on pay. Some business groups have pushed back against the requirements, saying they would add a burden in a tight job market.</p><p>The plan was among several corporate initiatives that Microsoft unveiled Wednesday, including paring back its use of noncompete clauses in employment agreements with U.S. workers and hiring a third-party firm to complete a civil-rights audit of its workforce policies and practices.</p><p>The policies dovetail with a growing demand among employees, government agencies and investors for greater transparency about corporate practices, including how firms manage their workforces, Ms. Rubin said. \"Shareholders are asking employers to provide information about what's going on internally so they can understand things around strategy, planning and management,\" she said.</p><p>Microsoft employed 181,000 people as of June 30, 2021, including 103,000 in the U.S. Its median worker was paid $177,000 last fiscal year, according to the company's latest proxy filing. Microsoft has struck a deal to acquire videogame maker Activision Blizzard Inc., which has nearly 10,000 employees.</p><p>Chip Cutter contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Lauren Weber at lauren.weber+1@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft to Disclose Pay Ranges for All U.S. Job Postings</p>",
