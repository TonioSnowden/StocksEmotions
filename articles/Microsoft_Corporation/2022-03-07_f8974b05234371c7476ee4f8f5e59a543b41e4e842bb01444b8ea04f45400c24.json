Thank you.</em></p> <p>As someone who has watched European energy strategy and politics for three decades, it's hard not to be cynical about the plight that Europe now finds itself in with regards to its dependence on Russian gas and oil. A whopping 38 per cent of the natural gas imports to the EU are sourced from Russia, with a fair bit of variance between countries — Germany and Italy are above the average, and Hungary is almost totally dependent on Russian energy, according to a recent Capital Economics report.</p> <p>The authors note that there are a number of options to replace Russian gas, should it be totally switched off, “including sourcing additional supplies from other producers and LNG, switching from gas to coal and, in Germany at least, delaying the planned closure of its three remaining nuclear reactors. According to calculations by Bruegel, if the EU were to do all of the above in full, it would have enough gas to get through next winter.”</p> <p>But that means that stocks would be almost completely depleted by April of 2023. And even if gas from Russia were to come back online by then, would anyone really want to depend on it?</p> <p>Clearly, Russian energy is not only not geopolitically reliable, it also runs counter to everything that Europe wants to do in relation to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/climate-capital\">climate</a>. So, on the first issue, is it possible that US shale or some other additional production from the US could fill the gap in future? I put that question to Caroline Bain, the chief commodities economist at Capital Economics, who had this to say:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“There is not a lot of additional US liquefaction capacity set to come online in the next year or so. The plants take years to build and bring online and plans for some future capacity were put on hold when gas prices plummeted in the wake of the pandemic. As it stands, we could see another jump in US LNG supply in around 2024-25. There are also constraints on the receiving end — our estimates suggest that over 70 per cent of Europe's gasification capacity was in use in January. Again it takes a few years — at least — for gasification capacity to be built.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Bain says that in the near term, there could be some redirecting of LNG from Asian markets. Japan and South Korea (the two largest importers after China) have high stocks and Japan has already redirected some LNG to Europe in a goodwill gesture. Asia's contracts do not normally allow the redirection of cargos, but given the current crisis (and sky-high prices), exporters may turn a blind eye. </p> <p>But what about the longer term. If we look at beyond 2023, I wonder if there's not an opportunity for a big transatlantic bargain on both energy and climate policy. President Joe Biden is taking a lot of flak right now from Republicans about how his climate programme has limited US shale production and fossil fuels in general. Fair enough, and good enough — we obviously want to move to a carbon neutral future. But right now we've got a looming energy crisis in Europe, one that will raise gas prices around the world and hurt average people at the pump. That may, in turn, hurt Democrats in the midterm elections. </p> <p>Would it be possible, given all this, for the US and Europe to strike some grand bargain on energy that would allow for increased fossil fuel production in the US over some set period of time — say five years — in exchange for the US agreeing to key European climate metrics, such as a price on carbon? This could be combined with programmes to move fossil fuel labour into greener areas of the economy. It seems like a chance for a real win-win on issues that have been incredibly contentious for some time. And while I'm dreaming, how about a transatlantic alliance (to be inked at the next EU-US Trade and Technology Council meeting in April) to create next generation green batteries? I'd love to see coal miners in West Virginia being paid what they are now to make those. </p> <p>As Swamp Notes readers will see, I'm desperately searching for some silver linings to the current crisis. Gideon, am I being way too Panglossian? Do you see any possibilities here? And what, if anything, is in your own silver lining playbook?</p> <h1>Recommended reading</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Read Dmitry Adamsky on why <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2022-03-05/russias-menacing-mix-religion-and-nuclear-weapons\">faith and nuclear weapons</a> are a terrifying mix in Russia.</p></li>  <li><p>I agree with Timothy Garton Ash that the EU should open the door to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/04/ukraine-eu-membership-zelenskiy-european-values-war\">membership for Ukraine</a>.

On the plus side, I think there has been a complete transformation in European attitudes to a great many things — Russia, Ukraine and the necessity for military spending to name just three. Most relevant to your question, there has been a sea change in attitudes to reliance on Russian gas and oil. Remember, until this crisis broke out, it was actually official German policy to increase their reliance on Russian energy through the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. It was conventional wisdom in much of Germany that this policy could even survive an outbreak of conflict. You would often hear people remark that, after all, the Soviet Union had continued to be a reliable supplier of gas throughout the cold war.</p> <p>This complacency survived roughly one day. In the immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Nord Stream 2 was mothballed. The Germans seem to understand that they are facing a real emergency that threatens their security and their way of life, and that some sacrifices will have to be made. Unlike Americans they are very close to the front line, so they may be more understanding when the price of petrol or heating rises. Simply keeping the lights on and the factories humming may be a challenge, however, in the short term. But you can expect them to throw everything at the problem. </p> <p>The Germans are meant to complete the phasing out of all nuclear power plants by the end of this year. They may now revisit that decision. In Italy, which is even more dependent on Russian gas than Germany, they are talking about once again firing up the country's coal-fired power stations. </p> <p>In the longer term, I think some kind of transatlantic bargain of the sort that you discuss is very viable. One thing that the Biden administration has definitely got right is its intense cultivation of the Europeans. Tony Blinken may lack the swagger of a John Kerry or a Mike Pompeo. But he is exactly the kind of soothing American voice that is required at the moment. </p> <p>However, the Europeans also know that Trump or a Trump equivalent could be back by 2024. For that reason, they will be reluctant to put all their chips on co-operation with Washington. They do not want to swap an unwise reliance on Russian energy for an unwise reliance on American technology and energy. Over the long term, the Europeans know that “strategic autonomy” (of which energy is a huge part) has to be their goal. In the short-term, they (we) need all the help that they (we) can get.</p> <p><em>Edward Luce is on book leave and will return in mid-March.</em></p> <h1>Your feedback</h1> <p><strong>And now a word from our Swampians . . .</strong> </p> <p><strong>In response to ‘</strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57b1caae-c9d8-4d9c-928c-66e2190ee653\"><strong>Would Putin ever really go nuclear?</strong></a><strong>':<br></strong>“Like most people, having seen what Russia did in Crimea, I won't put it past Putin to strong arm the rest of the world to allow it to keep Ukraine within his sphere of influence. Perhaps a kind of Finlandisation, as Rana suggested, may be the best outcome we the west can hope for. Finlandisation is not necessarily a bad thing for now. Who knows in years to come, Ukrainians may opt for closer alliance with the west, like Finland has done since the second world war, or they may flip and decide to get into the Russian bed. Time will tell!” <em>— Swamp Notes reader, Greater London</em></p> <p>“Since Putin's state of mind is unknowable (possibly even to him), until it is known we are dealing with Schrodinger's cat. This raises the question of whether calling the bluff, if it is a bluff, is more dangerous than letting him take the hand. If Fiona Hill is right, then delaying our decision, though not necessarily our actions, simply surrenders the strategic initiative to Putin.” <em>— Tom Burke, London</em></p> <p>“I am thinking now that the world needs more depressives, in leadership roles obviously but also among general populations. Psychopaths have had plenty of the limelight in recent years so they can return to the back of stage for a while.” <em>— Lou Spanos, Victoria, Australia</em></p><p>Source: Rana Foroohar 2022 'A grand bargain on energy?'
