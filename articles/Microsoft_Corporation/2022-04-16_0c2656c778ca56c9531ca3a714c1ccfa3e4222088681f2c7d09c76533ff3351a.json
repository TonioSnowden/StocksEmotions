  "text": "<p>   Which is better: A four-day workweek or five? </p><p>   Companies and governments around the world have been debating that question recently, driven by a tight labor market along with workers seeking flexibility. A proposal in the California State Legislature would define the workweek in the state as 32 hours, not 40, for larger companies. By the end of next week, the California State Assembly's Labor and Employment Committee is expected to decide if the bill will move forward. While the proposal is many steps away from becoming law, if passed, the bill could affect more than 2,000 businesses. </p><p>   Companies recently started to experiment seriously with reconfigured schedules. Companies from the funding platform Kickstarter in Brooklyn, N.Y., to Unilever New Zealand are piloting four-day workweek programs to test their productivity and work through snags. </p><p>   \"This is not going away,\" said Evan Low, a Democratic California State Assembly member who co-wrote the bill. Workers coming out of the pandemic prize flexible schedules, and some companies competing in a tight labor market are adapting, he added. </p><p>   If passed, the bill would define a workweek as 32 hours for private-sector companies with more than 500 employees. Hourly employees who log more time would need to be paid time-and-a-half for overtime. </p><p>   Earlier this month, the California Chamber of Commerce added the bill to its \"job killer list,\" saying the legislation would significantly increase labor costs. </p><p>   Requiring businesses to pay the same amount of money for one less day of work won't end well should the bill pass, said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford University economics professor. \"Jobs will shift to Nevada or Oregon, and employers will not be able to raise pay for many years,\" he said. A better alternative for businesses and shift workers who have to do work in person, he said, would be longer hours spread out across fewer days, with workers benefiting from not having to commute as much. </p><p>   Economic studies out of Germany and France found fewer hours didn't increase employment. A 2013 study on private companies in Belgium found employees who worked between 25 and 35 hours a week were more productive than those who worked more or less than that. </p><p>   A recent survey of 459 companies, mostly in tech, found 90% of companies didn't plan to adopt a four-day workweek, according to Sequoia Consulting Group, which conducted the research. In 2019, Microsoft Corp. discontinued a four-day week experiment in Japan after five weeks. </p><p>   Most tech workers say they put in a lot more than 40 hours a week, so getting their current jobs done in 32 hours would be tough, according to Kyle Holm, a vice president at Sequoia Consulting Group who advises clients on compensation and benefits. Salaried employees don't generally qualify for overtime. </p><p>   \"It doesn't really, to me, line up with what people are actually doing when they're not paid on an hourly basis,\" he said. In addition, many companies accommodated worker preferences by offering hybrid schedules, he said. </p><p>   A survey of more than 1,000 workers conducted by Qualtrics, a cloud software company, found 92% would support a four-day week and that 37% would be willing to take a 5% pay reduction for the schedule change. Many acknowledged the drawbacks, with nearly three-quarters saying they would end up working longer hours anyway. </p><p></p>",
