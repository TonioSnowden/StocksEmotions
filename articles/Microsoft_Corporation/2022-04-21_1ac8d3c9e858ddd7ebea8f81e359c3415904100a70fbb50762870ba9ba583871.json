Meanwhile, Insider Intelligence estimated that 3.6 million US adults will use crypto to make a purchase this year, up 68.6% from last year, a report released Wednesday shows.</p><p>In contrast, only 4% of merchants are accepting crypto as a method of payment, according to a study by Crypto.com released in February.</p><p>For most merchants, accepting crypto means a variety of risks, according to Shane Rodgers, co-founder and chief executive at PDX Advisors, which backs cryptocurrency PDX Coin. Crypto prices are volatile while crypto exchanges remain largely unregulated. Merchants also have to bear custody risks, Rodgers noted.</p><p>Some companies, such as electric car maker Tesla TSLA, hold bitcoin on its balance sheet, but most merchants and vendors \"are traditionally low margin businesses.\" \"They can't afford to take that risk,\" Rodgers told Distributed Ledger in an interview.</p><p>As a result, merchants that enable crypto payment usually partner with third-party services that allow them to convert crypto to fiat currencies, Rodgers noted.</p><p>Coinbase's NFT marketplace</p><p>Coinbase COIN launched a beta version of its social non-fungible token marketplace on Wednesday, six months after it first announced the plan in October.</p><p>Beta testers, who are invited based on their positions on the waitlist, will be able to create profiles to buy and sell NFTs using any self-custody wallet, according to the company's blog post. Users can also like, comment on and browse other NFTs on the platform, with functions similar to Instagram.</p><p>Coinbase made the push as part of its efforts to diversify its businesses and boost revenue, as crypto trading volume remains sluggish overall.
