  "title": "Ford CFO John Lawler Draws on His Operations Experience; The finance chief says his long tenure at the auto maker is an advantage as he works to transform the company",
  "text": "<p>John Lawler took over as Ford Motor Co.'s chief financial officer last year after more than three decades with the company. He succeeded an external hire: Tim Stone, a former Amazon.com Inc. executive, whose departure after about 18 months in the role was announced on Oct. 1, 2020, the day that Ford's new Chief Executive Jim Farley—also a company insider—took over.</p><p>Mr. Lawler, who started out as a finance analyst at the Dearborn, Mich.-based car maker, has held a long list of positions at Ford, including several operational roles. \"I understand what it's like to be on the other side,\" he said. \"They know that I've been in their shoes,\" he said, referring to his colleagues in operations.</p><p>That mind-set of an operational CFO, Mr. Lawler said, helps him to be more effective and win support from other teams across the company. \"I'm able to engage in the conversation, even though I am the finance guy,\" Mr. Lawler said.</p><p>His previous roles gave him oversight of the profits and losses of certain markets and products, and an understanding that \"what might seem like a simple decision can be much more difficult\" to execute, he said.</p><p>The company, which has pledged to spend more than $30 billion on electrification efforts by 2025, wants to accelerate some of its decision-making processes and become more agile, Mr. Lawler said. \"We need to be more flexible with how we're working with the operating team,\" he said.</p><p>Ford faces challenges similar to those of other combustion engine-based car companies that look to modernize their operations, including high spending needs and changes to the business model.</p><p>For Ford, that also involves trying to overhaul the company's thinking, Mr. Lawler said. The company wants to deepen its relationship with customers and become a seller of services and subscriptions—not just cars.</p><p>Finance is playing an important part in advancing the transformation of the business, Mr. Lawler said, especially when it is \"not just looking at what's happened in the rearview mirror, but looking forward.\" Ford, which uses Microsoft Corp.'s ubiquitous Excel in its finance department, said it is implementing robotic process automation and building out its service centers.</p><p>The company in recent quarters has announced investments in new facilities and partnerships, including with GlobalFoundries Inc.—a contract manufacturer and designer of semiconductors—and SK Innovation Co., a South Korean battery maker. Ford plans to invest $11.4 billion alongside SK in a new battery factory in Kentucky and build a new assembly plant in Tennessee.</p><p>\"We need to break the constraints around our battery-electric vehicles,\" Mr. Lawler said. \"Our demand is well [ahead] of supply.\" Ford has launched new models, including the Mach-E, the F-150 Lightning and the E-Transit.</p><p>The company last month said executives decided to scrap plans to develop an electric vehicle with Rivian Automotive Inc. and focus on independent projects instead. Mr. Lawler said he plans to build out the company's financial metrics, including around electrification.</p><p>Ford's share price has more than doubled since the beginning of the year, coming from a low base. The company is targeting an operating profit margin of 8% in 2023, up from an average of 4% in recent years.</p><p>Mr. Lawler also oversaw the early redemption of several billion dollars in high-price debt that Ford took on in April 2020. \"We're at a time where we should really look at that debt,\" he said. The company, which has a junk rating, is working to return to an investment-grade credit rating, Mr. Lawler said.</p><p>Ford, similar to General Motors Co., has been communicating more frequently with investors, said Bill Selesky, an analyst at Argus Research, a research provider. \"They have both taken it up a notch,\" he said.</p><p>The auto maker also wants to establish its sustainability credentials. Ford recently published a sustainable-financing framework, which lays out the company's strategy and serves as the basis for bond sales and other related financing instruments. The company in November sold a $2.5 billion green bond, at the time the largest such issuance in the U.S., according to Refinitiv, a data provider.</p><p>The company wants to cut its manufacturing emissions by 50% by 2030 and to become carbon neutral by 2050. Green bonds or similar financing instruments will help finance these changes, Mr. Lawler said.</p><p>In his personal life, Mr. Lawler hasn't switched to an electric vehicle yet. He drives a Mustang and an F-150. \"If you ask my wife, I have too many cars. So I do,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com</p><p>Ford CFO John Lawler Draws on His Operations Experience</p>",
