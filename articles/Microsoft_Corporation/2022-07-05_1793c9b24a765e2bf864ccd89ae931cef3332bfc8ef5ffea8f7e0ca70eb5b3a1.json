  "title": "Demand  For Chips  Eases as  Sales of  PCs Slow  ----  By Asa Fitch",
  "text": "<p>   The pandemic-era boom in semiconductors that spurred a global shortage is showing its first signs of weakness, driven by a slump in personal-computer sales and a rout in cryptocurrency markets. </p><p>   The frenzy to buy laptops and other gadgets early in the Covid-19 pandemic has vanished as inflation dissuades people from upgrading machines that they bought in the past couple of years amid the shift toward remote work and learning. The fading of the crypto boom also put an end to early pandemic scenes of people camping outside computer stores to buy chips for cryptocurrency mining and high-end videogaming. </p><p>   The pressure isn't easing in some in-demand areas, such as chips for cars and data centers, but the chillier consumer climate prompted some giants such as Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. to warn of rockier months ahead after two years of surging demand across their product lineups. </p><p>    David Zinsner, Intel's chief financial officer, said in June that the outlook for the second half of this year had gotten \"a lot noisier\" over the previous month, and that the company would look to align spending and investments to that reality. Intel temporarily froze hiring in its PC-chip division in June, among other belt-tightening measures. </p><p>   Memory maker Micron Technologies Inc. last week issued a muted sales outlook as Chief Executive Sanjay Mehrotra warned that \"the industry demand environment has weakened,\" with PC and smartphone sales declining. The company said it was cutting back on some spending plans to adjust to the new market dynamics. </p><p>   Chip executives, computer retailers and distributors say the market malaise has gotten worse in recent months -- more sluggish than many were expecting at the beginning of the year as U.S. inflation hit 8.6% in May, the highest in more than four decades. </p><p>   \"The up went way up, and the down went way down,\" said Kent Tibbils, vice president of marketing at ASI Corp., a major electronics distributor based in California, pointing to a falloff in demand for computers around March. \"Usually there's more of a gradual line, but it's been a little bit more volatile than what we might normally expect.\" </p><p>   Nvidia said it is dialing back hiring as the chip maker braces for slowdowns in two of its key areas, crypto mining and videogames. The company's chips are used for the heavy-duty computational work required to mine new cryptocurrency tokens, and they are prized by videogamers who bought its graphics cards during a pandemic-era surge in home-based entertainment. Both areas are weakening, and Nvidia's stock fell 48% in the first half of the year. </p><p>   Personal computer shipments are expected to retreat by 8.2% this year to 321.2 million units, according to International Data Corp., which cut its forecast in June. Those numbers are a sharp reversal from the height of the pandemic, when shipments grew 13% in its first year and 15% in the second. </p><p>   Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Chief Executive Lisa Su said last month that the company already had taken a conservative view of the PC segment for this year and expects computer demand to be roughly flat over the next few years. </p><p>   Computer-makers HP Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc. said they are seeing principally lower-end consumer PC demand softening, slightly offset by healthy sales to companies. </p><p>   PC shipments have been hit by not just softening appetite for new devices, but also supply-chain snarls from Covid lockdowns in China, where many computers are assembled, and the fallout from Western sanctions on Russia after the country's invasion of Ukraine. </p><p>   Analysts have grown more pessimistic about chip companies' sales prospects. In February, analysts estimated Intel would generate sales of around $18.4 billion in the second quarter, according to FactSet. Now the average estimate is for less than $18 billion, below what Intel has projected. Estimates for Nvidia's sales have also decreased 4% over the period, and are in line with the company's $8.1 billion sales guidance for the current quarter. </p><p>   \"Semi downturns happen every 3-4 years, and we could be due for another one,\" Bank of America analysts said last week. </p><p>   It isn't just chip makers that are resetting their expectations. Microsoft Corp. lowered its earnings outlook in June, citing a stronger dollar that has dented the value of its sales in foreign countries, and the company has slowed hiring. </p><p>   A potential silver lining for those customers who are still in shopping mode is that wait times for some semiconductors are starting to ease after swelling during the two-year-long chip drought. Chip lead times overall were at a near-record 27 weeks in May, according to Susquehanna Financial Group, but wait times for microcontrollers -- ubiquitous chips that have been a bugbear for auto makers and others -- shortened. </p><p></p>",
