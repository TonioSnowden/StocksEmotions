  "text": "<p>\n  DELTA AIR LINES INC. </p><p>\n  DAL -5.2% </p><p>\n  Airline giant Delta is flying high but faces new turbulence. It, along with other carriers, is grappling with surging costs, staffing and supply challenges during a busy summer season. Over the bustling Memorial Day weekend, Delta accounted for around half of all U.S. flight cancellations. On Wednesday it raised its second-quarter sales guidance, forecasting revenue will return to prepandemic levels on the back of higher demand and prices as travelers resume trips that may have been put on hold because of Covid-19. Delta shares fell 5.2% Wednesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  META PLATFORMS INC. </p><p>\n  FB -2.6% </p><p>\n  Sheryl Sandberg is logging out at Meta. Ms. Sandberg on Wednesday said she will leave as chief operating officer of the Facebook parent, ending her tenure as longtime lieutenant to Mark Zuckerberg that made her one of the most prominent women in business. The Wall Street Journal reported that Ms. Sandberg's departure was a culmination of years of burn-out that dovetailed with a company investigation into her activities. Ms. Sandberg will still be on Meta's board, and current Chief Growth Officer Javier Olivan will take over as COO. Meta shares lost 2.6% Wednesday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  MICROSOFT CORP. </p><p>\n  MSFT -1.7% </p><p>\n  Silicon Valley has long resisted organized labor, but that is changing at one tech giant. Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a blog post that Microsoft wouldn't interfere with employees' right to form or join unions and would collaborate with workers if they do choose to unionize. This comes after a wave of organization efforts hit Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc., as well as other companies. Microsoft is working to close its planned acquisition of videogame maker Activision Blizzard Inc., which also faces a unionization push. Microsoft shares decreased 1.7% Friday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  FORD MOTOR CO. </p><p>\n  F +2.5% </p><p>\n  Ford is revving up hiring and production. The auto maker said it will create 6,200 union manufacturing jobs and invest $3.7 billion into plants in Michigan, Ohio and Missouri. The plans come as Ford looks to expand vehicle production and prepare for the next round of negotiations with the United Auto Workers union set for 2023. As part of the workforce expansion, the auto maker said it plans to convert 3,000 temporary workers to full time, and all hourly employees will receive healthcare benefits on their first day of work. Ford shares gained 2.5% Thursday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  HORMEL FOODS CORP. </p><p>\n  HRL -5.2% </p><p>\n  Bird flu is ruffling Hormel. The Spam maker said it expects the U.S. avian influenza outbreak to weigh on its turkey flocks and the poultry industry in coming months. The outbreak, which has led to the death of nearly 40 million birds in the U.S., may push elevated meat prices even higher. Hormel reported higher sales and profit in its second quarter, with its Jennie-O turkey brand posting a 387% rise in profit, but cut the high end of its earnings outlook for the year as it faces the impact of the bird flu, rising costs and Covid-19 restrictions in China. Hormel shares lost 5.2% Thursday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  PFIZER INC. </p><p>\n  PFE +0.6% </p><p>\n  Covid-19 shots may soon be cleared for children under 5 years old. Pfizer and partner BioNTech SE on Wednesday asked the Food and Drug Administration to authorize three doses for the last Americans that don't have vaccine access. FDA clearance could come before the end of the month. The companies said last month that three doses of the shot were 80% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 and generated a robust immune response in children ages 6 months to 5 years old. Pfizer shares added 0.6% Thursday. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  UNILEVER PLC </p><p>\n  UL +9.9% </p><p>\n  The maker of Dove soap is refreshing its board with activist investor Nelson Peltz. Unilever disclosed that Mr. Peltz's Trian Fund Management now holds a 1.5% stake in addition to the new seat as a director. Since Chief Executive Alan Jope took the reins in 2019, Unilever's shares have underperformed those of rivals Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Nestle SA. Unilever jumped 9.9% Tuesday. </p><p></p>",
