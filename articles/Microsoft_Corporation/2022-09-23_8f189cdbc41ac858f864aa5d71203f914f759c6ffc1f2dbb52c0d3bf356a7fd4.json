  "text": "<p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you think Republicans will fare in this year's midterms? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Republicans need just a handful of seat pickups to take over the House, which Democrats now control 221-212 with two vacancies. Democrats' hopes have been buoyed by recent special election wins in New York and Alaska, but election analysts say Republicans remain the favorites to win control. The Senate, currently split 50-50, remains a tossup.</p><p>Mr. McCarthy, who was accompanied by other party leaders as well as far-right members Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Burgess Owens of Utah, traveled Friday to Monongahela, a small, working class community near Pittsburgh, to formally present his Commitment to America plan. Republicans walked onstage to country music star Toby Keith's \"Made In America.\"</p><p>In an effort to get the often-unruly caucus on board with the agenda, Mr. McCarthy delegated parts of the plan to top Republicans. Unlike past GOP speakers including Paul Ryan, Mr. McCarthy has avoided being personally identified with any particular policy or ideological wing of the party. He also has remained close to former President Donald Trump.</p><p>The Republicans' effort evokes former GOP leader Newt Gingrich's Contract With America, which helped the party win the House majority in 1994 for the first time in 40 years. That plan included provisions on balancing the budget, cutting cash welfare and cracking down on crime.</p><p>\"I believe we have a lot to run against… but if you want to drive up more votes, you have to stand for something too,\" said Rep. Don Bacon (R., Neb.), who is defending a competitive seat. \"So I think you need both. You need a left hook and a right hook.\"</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has opted to not unveil a policy plan as he works to win the majority in his chamber. Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.), who is leading the Senate Republican campaign efforts, released a plan earlier this year that called for tax increases on some Americans before revising it to be less specific; he would also require Congress to periodically review all government programs, a category that would include Social Security. Other Republicans panned Mr. Scott's proposal.</p><p>The House GOP commitment has four main themes: building a strong economy focused on fighting inflation and curbing costs; a safe nation which focuses on reducing crime and securing the border; a freedom-themed category related to schools and confronting big tech; and a focus on accountable government, a nod to planned scrutiny of Biden administration officials.</p><p>If Republicans do win control of the House, they will have the power to hold hearings and propose and pass legislation, but their ability to make new law will be limited—even if the party also takes the Senate. President Biden can veto bills, and many policies related to crime as well as school curriculum and transgender issues are controlled at the state or local level. Still, the plan served to stake out what the party considers key pitches to win over voters in November.</p><p>Republicans said they want to provide incentives for hiring 200,000 more police officers in the country to lower crime rates, as well as cut government spending to rein in inflation. The GOP also plans to \"protect the lives of unborn children and their mothers,\" a reference to the party's antiabortion stance. Many GOP lawmakers have signed onto a proposed 15-week abortion ban, though it wasn't discussed at the event.</p><p>The Supreme Court ended the federal right to abortion access in a ruling earlier this year, leaving the matter to the states, some of which quickly passed bill to restrict or protect abortion access. Democrats have pushed to reinstate broader rights to abortion, while Republicans have backed more limited access or an outright ban.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) called the GOP plan an \"alarming new extreme MAGA platform,\" citing the abortion stance and other parts of the proposal. Headed into the midterms, Democrats have worked to tie Republicans to Mr. Trump and his \"Make America Great Again\" slogan.</p><p>Mr. Biden, in a speech Friday at a Democratic National Committee event, called Mr. McCarthy's plan a \"thin series of policy goals with little or no detail.\"</p><p>He challenged Mr. McCarthy's argument that Republicans would keep the country safe, citing their opposition to his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which provided money to cities and states for public safety. He also highlighted that most Republicans voted against a recently passed gun law that had bipartisan support.</p><p>The climate, healthcare and tax law signed by Mr. Biden last month, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, include efforts to lower prescription-drug prices. It also provided $80 billion to the IRS for a decadelong transformation and expansion of tax enforcement, and the administration said last year that could include hiring 87,000 new employees. Some would be agents and auditors to crack down on tax dodging; some would answer phones or rebuild aging computer systems to clear up long-running customer-service problems.</p><p>Democrats have defended the spending as necessary to step up tax enforcement. They have emphasized that the money would reduce the budget deficit and police tax cheating by high-income households and corporations. Republicans have warned that the new agents would unfairly pursue small-business owners, and some have urged the administration to emphasize taxpayer service, privacy protections and computer improvements.</p><p>In comments Friday, GOP lawmakers also highlighted investigating the origins of Covid-19, as well as holding oversight hearings on many of Mr. Biden's cabinet secretaries, including the head of the Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, over what Republicans call lax U.S. border policy.</p><p>\"We will give Secretary Mayorkas a reserved parking spot, he will be testifying so much about this,\" said House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.).</p><p>Monongahela has been shrinking for decades, as factories closed. The area consistently voted for Democrats until 2008 and now favors Republicans.</p><p>\"In a lot of ways, the Democrat party left these voters,\" said Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, the Republican who represents the area. He helped write the China part of the Commitment to America agenda that calls for a select committee to look at Beijing's business practices, and looks at ways to keep businesses in the U.S.</p><p>Catherine Lucey contributed to this report.</p><p>Write to Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com</p><p>GOP House Leader Kevin McCarthy Rolls Out 'Commitment to America' for Midterms</p>",
