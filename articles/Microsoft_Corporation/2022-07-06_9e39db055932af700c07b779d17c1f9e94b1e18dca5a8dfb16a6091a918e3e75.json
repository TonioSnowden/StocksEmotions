  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 69.86 points, or 0.2%, to end at 31,037.68, after trading between small gains and losses.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX added 13.69 points, or 0.4%, closing at 3,845.08, its third straight session of gains, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP advanced 39.61 points, or 0.4%, finishing at 11,361.85, its third day in a row of gains.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Dow fell 129 points, or 0.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX notched a 0.1% rise and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.7%.</p><p>What drove markets</p><p>Stocks added to a string of gains after minutes of the Federal Reserve's June meeting released on Wednesday reiterated a resolve by Fed officialsto act aggressively through interest rate hikes given growing concerns about the possibility of inflation becoming entrenched in the economy.</p><p>Fed officials \"recognized that policy firming could slow the pace of economic growth for a time,\" the minutes said.

While he views higher interest rates as necessary to help bring inflation back down to the Fed's 2% target, he also worries that a \"global tsunami\" of monetary tightening could risk triggering a deeper U.S. recession.</p><p>Treasury bonds yields inverted again Wednesday afternoon, with the 2-year yield trading above the 10-year yield.</p><p>\"Recently a lot of the discussion has really been around this recession narrative, especially with the yield curve inverting for the third time this year,\" said Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist at Ally, by phone. \"The market just remains on edge because there's just a significant amount of uncertainty.\"</p><p>BlackRock's Bob Miller, head of America Fundamental Fixed Income, said the Fed appears to have \"a narrow path to tread\" as it works to lower inflation without \"breaking the economic recovery,\" in emailed comments.</p><p>Earlier, Japan's Nikkei 225 JP:NIK lost 1.2% and China's Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP shed 1.4% after it emerged Beijing was once again tacking COVID-19 outbreaks in several regions of the country.
