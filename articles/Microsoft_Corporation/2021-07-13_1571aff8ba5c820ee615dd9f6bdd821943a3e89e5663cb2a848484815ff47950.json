  "text": "<p>For companies that use cloud computing, \"it's increasingly critical to understand the full scope of their assets to reduce their attack surface,\" Mr. Doerr wrote.</p><p>Microsoft didn't disclose the deal's terms. Representatives for Microsoft and RiskIQ didn't respond to inquiries.</p><p>Internet vulnerabilities have drawn concern this year as cyberattacks proliferate with wide-ranging effects. In May, the 5,500-mile Colonial Pipeline, crucial to the East Coast's energy infrastructure, was temporarily shut down by its operator after a cyberattack, leading to gasoline shortages.</p><p>A month later, meat processor JBS SA said it was hit with a cyberattack that sent a portion of its beef and pork processing offline, a stoppage that reverberated through the food supply chain.</p><p>U.S. hospitals and municipal services have also been victimized by cyberattacks, demonstrating the threat they pose to public safety.</p><p>Mr. Doerr said that the addition of RiskIQ will expand Microsoft's existing security products for commercial customers.</p>",
