  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>From the mass shift to homeworking to the growth in ecommerce and widespread staff shortages, the pandemic and its aftermath continue to reshape global labour markets. </p> <p>We report today on plans by Monzo, the UK digital bank, to give its staff <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c9b06d5-20cb-46a3-a570-2fc4d98f44b6\">three-month paid sabbaticals</a> for every four years they work, the latest example of a company rethinking working patterns to cater for employees' demand for more flexibility. We also report on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/354328ff-e8a1-48b0-8594-0633de1e149d\">Amazon</a> hiring 25,000 new UK workers to handle the Covid sales boom. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a stronger economic recovery than expected, coupled with workers demanding better conditions or quitting the workforce altogether has led to severe labour shortages. The scale of the problem was highlighted by yesterday's data showing that the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc3d94f1-9c6c-4f5e-8536-9db90ff221cc\">jobless rate in the eurozone</a> had hit a record low of 7 per cent, with youth unemployment also at an all-time low of 14.9 per cent.</p> <p>While businesses are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3326728f-025c-48d0-b137-f493f98850cc\">increasing pay, perks and training</a> to try to address the problem, workers are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d043531-9a0b-4740-98e2-8f67606e5677\">flexing their muscles</a>. US unions are even having some success organising at notoriously hard-to-crack companies such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33d605b8-2025-48cf-9f2e-60f8f97cfd3b\">Starbucks</a>. </p> <p>As Delphine Strauss reports, the current pay bargaining season in the UK is set to be one of the most confrontational in years. Policymakers at the Bank of England fear a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b49d95f3-1853-4fcf-95f8-5f6103dea989\">wage-price spiral</a> of workers demanding rises because of higher living costs, while companies raise prices to protect their margins in a “repeating, self-fulfilling process”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The UK policy response to labour shortages however is a “prime example of what not to do”, writes columnist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c67f8bb-afb6-4d03-b88f-fd870d872c17\">Sarah O'Connor</a>. New restrictions on claiming benefits not only posit a solution to a problem that does not exist, they could actually&#xa0;make the situation worse, she says. </p> <p>In the US, new data yesterday showed demand for workers and the number quitting their jobs remained at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4450c59-f2a6-49ff-acb5-257a55f141cd\">historically high levels</a>, but, as the FT Editorial Board points out, the rethinking of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/857bdeba-b61b-4012-ab82-3c9eb19506df\">traditional attitudes to work</a> is not confined to the US. In China, the “lie flat” movement is encouraging young people to opt out of the rat race. In Japan, the government is responding to the traditional long-hours culture by talking of a four-day working week. And a recent survey from Microsoft has found 41 per cent of the global workforce is considering giving notice.</p> <p>It is too soon to say if the “great resignation” will fizzle out when economies return to some kind of normal or whether it is a mark of a new, existential shift in labour markets, the FT says. </p> <p>But there is a growing sense that Americans are rethinking their work-life balance, which could fuel calls for European-style social safety-nets as well as new working arrangements offering more security and flexibility. “Capital has dominated labour for half a century but the tables are turning,” it concludes. “Employers, take note.” </p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Shares in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd26296f-2d77-45e3-bc88-9e823e4a4be4\">Google parent Alphabet</a> surged after the company reported a 32 per cent jump in Q4 revenues, pushing the company back towards a market capitalisation of $2bn</p></li>  <li><p>The number of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05c3be6a-2e9a-41f8-aa3d-4f68c35be357#post-a79e0022-32f1-4648-aa45-3bb62525588a\">tourist visits to Spain</a> picked up more than 64 per cent in 2021 but still lie below pre-pandemic levels</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05c3be6a-2e9a-41f8-aa3d-4f68c35be357#post-e2c2d1e2-4f7b-4a02-bcbd-c98d1bac0c6c\">Profits at Ferrari</a> passed pre-pandemic levels last year as production at the luxury car group hit a new record </p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05c3be6a-2e9a-41f8-aa3d-4f68c35be357\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>An unexpected leap in <strong>eurozone inflation</strong> in January to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef5ce3b5-f8a6-43ca-9a4d-3a507d12ddab\">record 5.1 per cent</a> from a year earlier increased the pressure on the European Central Bank to tighten policy at its meeting this week. Energy prices in the bloc rose a record 28.6 per cent.</p> <p><strong>Opec</strong> and its allies agreed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9da4cd41-fcc4-4c13-938d-00ff8bc1d499\">boost oil production</a> for the eighth month in a row, continuing to gradually replace the output cut at the start of the pandemic. Prices have started strongly in 2022, passing a seven-year high in January to hit more than $90 a barrel for the first time since 2014.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>The UK set out <strong>“levelling-up”</strong> proposals to address the country's left-behind regions and devolve power to regional authorities. Critics claimed there was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03b9557e-4ee2-4401-b2cf-ddac4f4c6c7a\">no new money</a> involved and that local government has been subject to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b353b6bd-3035-4ee5-8342-17f7537e8d05\">decade of cuts</a>.</p> <p>Ministers will also unveil proposals tomorrow to help households cope with <strong>soaring energy bills</strong> to coincide with details from regulator Ofgem of a sharp rise in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b4ca9e3-0e42-4053-957f-9baed6a0b196\">energy price cap</a>. New <strong>saving and borrowing data</strong> highlighted the scale of the country's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eff60c38-7421-49fd-b424-7ca95332aa42\">cost-of-living squeeze</a>.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>WTO director-general <strong>Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala</strong> warned that the global supply chain crisis would last <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4938ca14-1039-4a0c-8734-2deef8070ac4\">longer than originally expected</a> and that developing countries could be hit particularly hard by higher transaction costs. The WTO is organising a meeting of business executives, ministers and trade experts in March to discuss ways to ease blockages.</p> <p>Chief economics commentator Martin Wolf argued <strong>US Federal Reserve</strong> policy was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35ce0c88-48a7-46cc-8f2f-51c69632f43e\">still too loose</a>, even though the economic recovery and surge in inflation have long been clear.</p> <p><strong>India</strong> is increasing public spending <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0a6cf20-c4c0-43a0-a717-010167dbf1e7\">by more than a third</a>, with a focus on infrastructure, to reclaim its crown as the world's fastest-growing large economy. The country's central bank is also launching its own digital currency alongside a hefty tax on cryptocurrency profits.</p> <p>The FT Editorial Board argued that the IMF agreement with <strong>Argentina</strong> to restructure $44.5bn of debt did little more than <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65cb9e49-2dce-46e7-b2a5-e006e7280648\">paper over the cracks</a> and should have come with tougher strings attached. On Monday, in protest against the deal, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/400d765b-e838-494b-822e-70cd1958a2c7\">Máximo Kirchner</a> quit as leader of the Peronist bloc in the country's lower house. </p> <p><strong>Combating Pandemics</strong>, our new special report, examines the political and policy lessons from the current pandemic that could help mitigate the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/fthealth-combating-pandemics\">effect of future crises</a>.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p>Profits at <strong>Santander</strong> soared in the final quarter of last year as the Spanish bank was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e13af549-5780-4352-b998-7fc04e25bddc\">lifted by economic recovery</a> and growing business in the US, UK and Brazil. Full-year net profit came in at €8.1bn, helped by lower loan losses than expected, in marked contrast to the €8.8bn loss it suffered in 2020. Swiss private bank <strong>Julius Baer</strong> also announced record profits, thanks to the surging fortunes of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05c3be6a-2e9a-41f8-aa3d-4f68c35be357#post-805152ba-351e-47ec-bb21-4d7c8e38cc79\">world's wealthy</a>.</p> <p>A crisis in the UK's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50686656-7ee8-460a-ae28-6af1a1e3228c\">meat, beer and soft drinks</a> industries has been averted by a deal to secure supplies of <strong>carbon dioxide</strong> from CF Industries, the country's biggest producer, for its industrial gas customers. CF had shut its two plants last September as soaring natural gas prices made the production of fertiliser uneconomical, and with it the supply of CO2, a byproduct of the manufacturing process. </p> <p>Relations between <strong>airlines and airports</strong> are souring as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9314ac84-4292-4824-ae34-8c11fd136a1f\">disruption from the pandemic</a> drags on. The world's airlines are forecast to lose another $11bn this year and argue that airport owners should be forced to share the pain, while the latter are intent on raising fees to cover their own losses and invest in infrastructure. <strong>Air France-KLM </strong>is under pressure to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38fbfb6a-4c40-4ae2-893f-f3a760833273\">repay state aid</a> so it can take part in deals that could reshape the industry. </p> <p>Businesses in <strong>Western Australia</strong>, the country's largest and most mineral-rich state, have criticised local leaders after the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8106a3b4-94a4-489d-8c9e-c3ad3345dd58\">reopening of domestic borders</a> was postponed because of the rapid rise of the Omicron variant. Although two years of isolation have helped the mining industry avoid the surge of Covid cases experienced at other sites across the country, they have fuelled shortages of mineworkers.</p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p>Arguing for a <strong>pay rise</strong> is difficult at the best of times, never mind when discussions take place online rather than in real life.
