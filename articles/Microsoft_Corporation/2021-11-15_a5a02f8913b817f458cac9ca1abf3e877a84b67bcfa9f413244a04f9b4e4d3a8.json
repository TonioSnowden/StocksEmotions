  "text": "<p>Wait, what was that one?</p><p>J.J. Cooper has become fluent in interpreting the cacophony of notifications emitted by his phone and computer each workday. But this ding was different.</p><p>\"It was that needle-scratching-on-a-record kind of sound where it's like, wait a minute,\" says the 49-year-old, who edits a baseball magazine and website in North Carolina. \"I was like, no, I have to find out what this thing is.\"</p><p>He trawled through 20 open tabs. But it took him a while to find the culprit.</p><p>\"Another notification distracted me,\" he says.</p><p>We're on alert overload. Stray comments and offhand requests once shouted across the office now blink and buzz at us from Microsoft Teams and Slack. Our communication has grown fragmented, spread across myriad apps we have to learn, conform to, remember to check.</p><p>Meanwhile, personal texts and social-media mentions have bled into the workday after all this time at home, adding another layer of distraction to our time on the clock. Why put your phone on silent if the boss isn't hovering over you?</p><p>Our culture has evolved to accommodate rapid communication, says Gloria Mark, a professor of informatics at the University of California, Irvine, and it can be mentally taxing. Many of us struggle to conjure up that brilliant thought that hit right before the notification burst in. \"Your memory is just overflowing with information,\" she says.</p><p>It doesn't make for great circumstances for getting work done, but there are ways individuals, managers and organizations can contend with the onslaught.</p><p>Dr. Mark's research finds people switch screens an average of 566 times a day. Half the time we're interrupted; the other half we pull ourselves away. Breaks—even mindless ones like scrolling Facebook—can be positive, replenishing our cognitive resources, Dr. Mark says.</p><p>But when something external diverts our focus, it takes us an average of 25 minutes and 26 seconds to get back to our original task, she has found. (Folks often switch to different projects in between.) And it stresses us out. Research using heart monitors shows that the interval between people's heart beats becomes more regular when they're interrupted, a sign they're in fight-or-flight mode.</p><p>The onus is on teams and organizations to create new norms, Dr. Mark says. If individuals just up and turn off their notifications they'll likely be penalized for missing information. Instead, managers should create quiet hours where people aren't expected to respond.</p><p>\"It's a matter of relearning how to work,\" she says.</p><p>Matt McDonald has tried. Last year, his company encouraged everyone to test out muting Slack notifications. The 36-year-old, who works for a digital agency in South Carolina, made it a couple of hours before caving.</p><p>\"I'd keep checking just to make sure I'm not holding anybody else up,\" he says. \"No matter what, I keep crawling back to the notifications.\"</p><p>He dreads having a pile of work waiting for him if he lets up for too long. And no matter what his bosses and colleagues say they expect, he can't shake the idea that Slack messages are supposed to be addressed instantaneously.</p><p>\"There's this feeling that someone sent this to you and they're waiting for this response that has a ticker counting down,\" he says.</p><p>Emily Parks, a productivity consultant in Raleigh, N.C., says some of her clients are energized by hopping back and forth between tasks. She recommends they turn off notifications for 25 minutes to focus, then take a five-minute break afterward. Those with longer attention spans should aim to hunker down for 52 minutes, then take a 17-minute break.</p><p>The key to safely logging off email or Slack for a stretch is being transparent, she says. Tell your boss you really want to be able to focus, and ask what they think is a good frequency for you to check messages. Set an appointment on your calendar at first, and you'll develop a habit. \"You are in control,\" she says.</p><p>And keep your clicks to a minimum. Tools like Apple's Mail app can amalgamate all your email inboxes in one place, Ms. Parks says. Most of her clients receive 300 to 500 emails a day, across multiple accounts. Platforms like Hootsuite or Buffer can roll together various social-media mentions.</p><p>Sometimes the problem isn't even yours, technically. Kelly Mayes, a public-relations professional who has long worked from home, hates notifications.</p><p>\"They just make me insane,\" she says.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you handle notifications? Join the conversation below.</p><p>So she turned all hers off. Then, in March 2020, her husband started working from their Franklin, Tenn., home as well. Turns out he likes keeping his volume up, and he gets about 10 Slack notifications every five minutes.</p><p>\"I was like, 'Hey, that knocking sound, you like that? That works for you?'\" Ms. Mayes says, referring to one of the platform's distinctive audio alerts. She felt her anxiety flare reflexively with every ping. \"It was a different company—totally not my problem. But it brought me back into that place of, 'Everything's on fire, something needs my attention.'\"</p><p>She took to wearing AirPods and listening to an audio book or music during the workday. And she convinced her husband to turn off notifications when he's working in more central parts of the house.</p><p>Shawn J. Burke tried to eliminate notifications he felt were useless (ads from Uber) so he could focus on the ones he can't miss (when does that meeting start again?) But recently, he was greeted with a new phantom beep. He couldn't even figure out which device it was coming from.</p><p>\"I'd move to another part of the house and bam, it would pop up again,\" says Mr. Burke, who lives in Garden Grove, Calif., and works for mortgage-technology company PhoenixTeam. He isolated his Samsung watch, which he had recently reset, in the bathroom. After 48 hours of fiddling, he was eventually able to diagnose the issue: a default to factory settings he had inadvertently triggered.</p><p>He felt victorious. And yet, surveying his collection of seven work and personal computers, phone and watch, he sometimes wonders if it's all worth it.</p><p>\"This was all supposed to make our life easier,\" he says.</p><p>Write to Rachel Feintzeig at rachel.feintzeig@wsj.com</p><p>Ping.
