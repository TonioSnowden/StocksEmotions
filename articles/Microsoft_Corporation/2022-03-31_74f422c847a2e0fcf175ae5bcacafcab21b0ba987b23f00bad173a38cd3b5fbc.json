  "title": "Australian Journalist Tried in China on Suspicion of Disclosing State Secrets; Cheng Lei's detention in August 2020 coincided with a sharp downturn in diplomatic relations between Beijing and Canberra",
  "text": "<p>Chinese authorities denied Australian diplomats access to Ms. Cheng's trial on national-security grounds, a decision that Graham Fletcher, Australia's ambassador to China, said was deeply concerning, unsatisfactory and regrettable.</p><p>Mr. Fletcher said China hasn't explained the charges against Ms. Cheng, including what state secrets it alleges have been disclosed or to which country. \"That is part of the reason we are so concerned,\" he said from outside the courthouse before the trial started. \"We can have no confidence in the validity of the process, which is conducted in secret.\"</p><p>Asked if he believed the case was a political one, Mr. Fletcher said: \"We have no reason to make that conclusion.\"</p><p>Mr. Fletcher said that Australian diplomats had last visited her on March 21 and were satisfied as to her welfare under detention. \"Considering the circumstances, she's doing OK,\" he said.</p><p>Ms. Cheng has been able to choose her lawyers, whom Mr. Fletcher described as \"very competent lawyers who are doing their job well,\" though he also called on China to allow her to speak to her children.</p><p>Earlier this week, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry declined to comment on the specifics of Ms. Cheng's case, but said: \"China's judiciary handles cases in accordance with law and fully protects the lawful rights of the person involved.\"</p><p>Former colleagues of Ms. Cheng believe the case to be an example of arbitrary detention, which took place against a backdrop of worsening ties between Australia and China. Ms. Cheng was detained in August 2020, not long after Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, which was first identified in China. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in February last year that Chinese authorities had advised Australia that Ms. Cheng was arrested on suspicion of supplying state secrets overseas.</p><p>Bilateral ties remain in a deep freeze, with China imposing tariffs and other restrictions on Australian imports including coal and barley. Australia has moved to strengthen military ties with its allies, including a new security pact with the U.S. and U.K. that paves the way for it to acquire a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. Last month, it accused a Chinese warship of shining a laser at one of its surveillance planes flying off Australia's northern coast.</p><p>Mr. Morrison, who has put his national-security record at the front of a reelection campaign, this month refused to meet China's new ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian. \"So long as China continues to refuse to have dialogue with Australian ministers and the prime minister, I think that's an entirely proportional response,\" Mr. Morrison said.</p><p>Ms. Cheng isn't the only Australian to have been charged by China with disclosing state secrets. Yang Hengjun, an Australian blogger and spy novelist, hasn't been sentenced since his closed-door trial in May 2021 for espionage. Mr. Yang was born in China and once worked for the Chinese government before migrating to Australia.</p><p>Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has repeatedly raised concerns about Ms. Cheng's situation with senior Chinese officials. Ms. Payne, the foreign minister, said consular officials most recently visited Ms. Cheng on March 21 and the government had asked China to allow Australian diplomats to attend the trial.</p><p>\"We expect basic standards of justice, procedural fairness and humane treatment to be met, in accordance with international norms,\" Ms. Payne said on Saturday.</p><p>Ms. Cheng was educated at Australia's University of Queensland and had worked for CGTN since 2012, according to her LinkedIn profile. During the 19 months that she has been in detention, Ms. Cheng has been unable to speak to her children, 10 and 12 years old, who are in Melbourne, said the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, an Australian union.</p><p>Karen Percy, federal president of the MEAA's Media Section, said it is concerned that there has been no due process in Ms. Cheng's case, which has been conducted largely in secret.</p><p>\"We are concerned that the accusations against her have never been explained and that she has been denied proper legal representation,\" Ms. Percy said.</p><p>Annelise Nielsen, a journalist who previously worked with Ms. Cheng at CGTN, said she was a popular and widely respected journalist. Ms Cheng has been sharing a cell with at least two others and has limited access to literature, although she was recently allowed to watch the Winter Olympics, which were hosted by Beijing, Ms. Nielsen said.</p><p>MEAA and Ms. Nielsen co-wrote an open letter in 2021 signed by a journalists, colleagues and friends that called for Ms. Cheng's release from prison.</p><p>A signatory to the open letter and another former colleague from CGTN, Kylie Purcell, said Ms. Cheng had a high-profile role within the company, which made her arrest unexpected.</p><p>\"I know a lot of colleagues were very shocked about it,\" Ms. Purcell said.</p><p>Jonathan Cheng in Beijing contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alice Uribe at alice.uribe@wsj.com</p><p>Australian Journalist Tried in China on Suspicion of Disclosing State Secrets</p>",
