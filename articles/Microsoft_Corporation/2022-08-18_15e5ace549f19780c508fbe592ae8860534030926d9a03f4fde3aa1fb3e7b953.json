  "text": "<p>A hiring spree and a surge in company travel led Dutch payments group Adyen to miss first-half revenue estimates despite a 60 per cent increase in the volume of transactions, driven by the post-coronavirus lockdown travel boom.</p> <p>Net revenues for the first six months of the year rose 37 per cent year on year to €608.5mn, Adyen said on Thursday, but came in below analysts' estimates of €615.2mn. The volume of transactions processed hit €345.8bn as travel picked up, beating the €329.9bn forecast.</p> <p>The revenue miss pushed the group's share price down by more than 11 per cent on Thursday to €1,603. Adyen's share price remains well above its public listing in 2018, but it is still more than 30 per cent down this year, mirroring wider troubles for the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/companies/technology\"> tech sector</a> amid rising interest rates and economic uncertainty.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/350e4382-fe64-39b9-ada6-2c28c9336244\">Adyen</a> acts as an intermediary between other payment groups and merchants, including Uber, LinkedIn, Spotify and Microsoft, and has begun supporting Apple's Tap to Pay option for merchants.</p> <p>Despite the falling share price, chief financial officer Ingo Uytdehaage defended the company's strategy of focusing on investing and hiring.</p> <p>“We have a group of investors that are very much long-term focused,” he said. “That's why we're not focused on consensus numbers, we understand that this a long-term play.”</p> <p>While ecommerce remains Adyen's main driver of revenue, the transaction volumes at bricks-and-mortar stores almost doubled to €45bn in the first half of 2022 as they reopened. Adyen also launched its own sale terminals for merchants this year.</p> <p>Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose 31 per cent year on year to €356.3mn, in line with results from the second half of 2021 but below the €383.5mn estimated by brokers.</p> <p>Operating expenses rose almost 50 per cent to €277.7mn, driven by a 33 per cent increase in employee benefits to €158.5mn. Adyen hired almost 400 employees in the first half of year, as many as it did in the whole of 2021.</p> <p>Travel and other staff expenses, such as events, increased fivefold to €15.7mn as lockdowns ended. Adyen had 2,575 full-time employees at the end of the first half of 2022.</p> <p>The company, founded in 2006, was listed on Amsterdam's Euronext exchange in 2018 with a market value of more than €13bn at its debut. It is currently valued at close to €50bn.</p> <p>Payment fintechs boomed during the pandemic, benefiting from the success of ecommerce during lockdowns. But the sector has faced growing headwinds as consumer spending has been curtailed by rising costs driven by rapid inflation globally.</p> <p>“Of course we follow macroeconomic trends closely,” said Uytdehaage, “but because of diversification, we're in a pretty good position — if some industries face difficulties, others do better, so we're not too concerned at the moment.”</p> <p>Adyen did not update its guidance from February, which includes a long-term ebitda margin of 65 per cent and the aim to grow net revenue between the mid-20s and low-30s in the medium term.</p><p>Source: Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan in London 2022 'Adyen shares slide as hiring spree and travel costs hit earnings' FT.com 18 August.
