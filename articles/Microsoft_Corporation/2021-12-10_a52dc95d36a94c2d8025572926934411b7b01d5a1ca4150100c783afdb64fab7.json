  "title": "U.S. News:  Aerospace Firms  Probed Over Alleged  No-Poach Deals  ----  By Brent Kendall and Doug Cameron",
  "text": "<p>   The Justice Department charged a former Pratt &amp; Whitney manager with conspiring with engineering firms not to poach each other's workers, the first case in a continuing antitrust investigation in the aerospace industry. </p><p>   Prosecutors, in documents unsealed Thursday in a Connecticut federal court, alleged that Mahesh Patel, as director of engineering services at Pratt &amp; Whitney, was a leader of a nearly decadelong conspiracy with several of the jet-engine maker's suppliers to keep labor costs down. </p><p>   Pratt employs more than 39,000 staff and is one of the world's largest engine makers, powering commercial aircraft such as the Airbus A320neo and the F-35 combat jet produced by Lockheed Martin Corp. </p><p>   Mr. Patel and executives for the suppliers doing outsourced work on behalf of Pratt agreed not to hire or recruit each other's engineers or other skilled workers, which unlawfully limited the employees' wages and opportunities, the department alleged. </p><p>   \"Mahesh says he does not want the salaries to increase,\" one alleged co-conspirator wrote in 2016, according to a court document. </p><p>   A lawyer representing Mr. Patel said he had no comment. </p><p>   Mr. Patel lists himself as Pratt's director of global-engineering sourcing on his LinkedIn page, having been with the company for 27 years. He no longer works for the company, according to a person familiar with its hiring. </p><p>   Pratt has been a subsidiary of Raytheon Technologies Corp. since 2020. Raytheon said it is cooperating with the inquiry and is committed to complying with applicable state and federal laws. The charges cover alleged events from 2011 to 2019, and involved a half-dozen firms, which weren't identified by name in court documents. </p><p>   The Justice Department for several years brought a series of civil antitrust cases to crack down on no-poach agreements, particularly in the tech sector. But last year the department began warning that future violations would be charged criminally, and it has followed through on that threat. </p><p>   The engineering workforce is aging and aerospace companies face competition from tech and financial-services firms, and other manufacturers, for talent. </p><p></p>",
