  "title": "Phunware's stock was up 1,000% on Friday. What in the world is Phunware?",
  "text": "<p>At one point early Friday, shares in Phunware PHUNhad surged more than 1,100%, giving the company a market cap close to $2 billion.</p><p>That's not too shabby for a relatively tiny Austin, Texas–based tech outfit specializing in advertising software via mobile applications and location tracking that, according to its own financials, realized a net loss of $8.3 million in the second quarter on net revenue of $1.4 million.</p><p>Phunware, founded in 2009, went public via a SPAC in December 2018 and came to some prominence in 2019 for its work with Donald Trump's re-election campaign. Phunware reportedly received a $3 million contract from Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, and its stock went from $10 a share in December 2018 to more than $300 a share by Feb 1, 2019. By April 2019, shares were trading for less than $6.</p><p>One year later, the company was slapped with a Nasdaq delisting warning after its stock had traded below the $1 mark for 30 consecutive days. That same month, it was revealed that Phunware had applied for and received $2,850,336 in Paycheck Protection Program loans from JPMorgan Chase, despite being a publicly traded company.</p><p>Phunware's chief operating officer, Randall Crowder, defended the PPP loan at the time by telling a local Texas news channel that the company was in too dire a situation not to take the money.</p><p>“Phunware is an 11-year-old technology company with a market cap somewhere around $25 million, with 56 employees. We've been unprofitable for the last 11 years,” Crowder explained at the time. “Banks aren't loaning to unprofitable tech companies. There is no access to capital.”&#xa0;</p><p>Phunware managed to get its share price back above a dollar in time to appease its exchange, but the stock has languished since and was trading at 90 cents a share as recently as Oct. 8.</p><p>But thanks to retail investors caught up in what appears to be an emerging MAGA meme mania, Phunware's prior relationship with Trump through his fired aide Parscale makes it a possible investment play for everyone looking to capitalize on the madcap froth around Trump's announced deal with SPAC outfit Digital World Acquisition Corp. DWAC. The former president's nascent Trump Media &amp; Technology Group went public through its own reverse merger this week. </p><p>On one subreddit, users egged each other on to keep buying PHUN shares and reminding the group of 2019's massive price rise.</p><p>“This stock ran to $500 per in 2019,” blared the headline of one post. “With that being said we all know even higher is possible now.”</p><p>Commenters on that post agreed with the sentiment, with many users annoyed that the stock was finding resistance at $20, while a noticeably larger contingent made it clear they were selling their shares in cannabis grower Sundial Growers SNDL to move their money into PHUN.</p><p>On Twitter, users backing PHUN had fun with the ticker symbol and predicted that the stock would rocket further, cementing their claims with pro-Trump memes.</p><p>While Phunware's big early gains had been pared back to a mere 600% gain at midday Friday, retail interest in DWAC remained fervid with the stock soaring another 140% by midsession bringing its not-even-two-day price growth to more than 900%.</p>",
