  "title": "After Hitting It Big With Photo Licensing, This Serial Entrepreneur Wants to Start More Companies; Jon Oringer founded Shutterstock using 30,000 pictures he shot himself. He says it is now time to get involved with startups—hundreds of them.",
  "text": "<p>Over the past year, he and a partner have invested in more than 100 high-tech startups, 10 of which Mr. Oringer himself co-founded. He prefers to bankroll executives who have started and run businesses that flopped.</p><p>\"Trying again after failing shows perseverance,\" the 47-year-old entrepreneur explains. \"We look for people with that track record because it's the same as my track record.\"</p><p>Mr. Oringer spent $10,000 to launch Shutterstock from his Manhattan apartment in 2003, after several of his earlier startups had failed. The value of his digital-images marketplace soared following its 2012 initial public offering. He soon became a billionaire.</p><p>Shutterstock, currently based in the Empire State Building, reported 2020 revenue of $666.7 million. The long-profitable company serves customers in more than 150 countries. Its vast collection includes videos, illustrations, 3-D models and music as well as photos. Shutterstock's library contains more than 380 million photographs.</p><p>Bio Bits</p><p>* Age: 47</p><p>* Education: Bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematics from Stony Brook University and master's degree in computer science from Columbia University</p><p>* Family: Wife Talia. Daughter, age 2, and infant son</p><p>* Favorite electronic game: New York Times crossword puzzle</p><p>* Management mantra: Move fast, iterate quickly and don't be afraid to pivot</p><p>* Secret talent: I've been playing guitar since I was 13 and have a collection of 40 vintage guitars</p><p>* Superpower you wish you had: Being able to slow time down to get more done</p><p>* Worst advice you ever got: When I was taking Shutterstock public, I was advised by several people not to engage in an IPO</p><p>Last year, Mr. Oringer switched to executive chairman from chief executive. He gave up Shutterstock's top spot because he wanted to nurture early-stage businesses again. \"It's still what I do best,'' he says during a Zoom interview from his Hamptons home.</p><p>He turns to close confidants during such significant career shifts. \"They often advise me to trust my instincts,\" adds Mr. Oringer, a man with salt-and-pepper hair who now owns about 34% of Shutterstock shares, worth nearly $1.5 billion. \"Every investment of your time or your money is a calculated risk.''</p><p>Mr. Oringer knows plenty about taking risks. Licensed as a commercial helicopter pilot, he occasionally flies the one he owns.</p><p>Technology has fascinated him since his childhood in the New York suburb of Scarsdale. He figured out how to code software by the third grade.</p><p>During high school, the youth earned almost $50 an hour repairing home computers. Mr. Oringer decided to pursue an entrepreneurial career that involved computers—and no boss.</p><p>\"I wanted to build something big,'' he recalls. But \"I wanted to do things my way.\"</p><p>Mr. Oringer founded a software business while majoring in computer science and mathematics at Stony Brook University. He earned a master's degree in computer science from Columbia University in 1999.</p><p>His most popular software product, from his company SurfSecret. blocked pop-up advertisements online. In 2000, however, Microsoft Corp. incorporated a similar tool into its Internet Explorer browser. The move \"disrupted me out of business,\" Mr. Oringer says.</p><p>The 20-something entrepreneur subsequently created, and simultaneously ran, a dating site, an online legal-services company, an advertising network—and Shutterstock. The subscription-based stock-photo agency was the sole survivor.</p><p>Mr. Oringer, an amateur photographer, started that business by spending nine months shooting 100,000 photos and posting the best 30,000 of them on its website. The new company aimed to make photo licensing more affordable by offering crowdsourced images and subscription access.</p><p>\"It was surprising that Shutterstock made it,'' he remarks. \"None of us could predict what the internet would look like.''</p><p>Here are four of his most valued advisers:</p><p>Rich Handler</p><p>CEO of Jefferies Financial Group Inc.</p><p>Mr. Handler was among the investment bankers involved with taking Shutterstock public. Just before that milestone, the veteran public-company CEO spent about three hours with Mr. Oringer describing actions he should take to flourish at the helm of a newly public business.</p><p>\"I wanted to give him the benefit of my success and failures to best help him prepare,'' Mr. Handler remembers.</p><p>The banker recommended that Mr. Oringer give priority to the long term, for example. Mr. Handler also urged him to \"never get sucked into the Wall Street treadmill from hell of unrealistic and unsustainable growth.''</p><p>Mr. Oringer believes this mentor's best advice was that he should underpromise and overdeliver. Early-stage companies commonly overpromise \"because you underestimate the obstacles,\" the Shutterstock founder observes.</p><p>Rachna Bhasin</p><p>Founder of EQ Partners LLC</p><p>They got to know each other well several years ago, when Shutterstock did a licensing deal with Magic Leap Inc., the augmented-reality headset manufacturer where she was then chief business officer.</p><p>Ms. Bhasin joined Shutterstock's board in 2019, shortly after she set up a strategic advisory, consulting and investment firm.</p><p>Mr. Oringer especially appreciates her insights about expanding Shutterstock through acquisitions because \"she has been through a lot of them.'' Similarly, they brainstorm about how to make sure that all kinds of business partnerships remain a key part of Shutterstock's strategy.</p><p>\"I always challenge him on what doors are opened and closed as we make strategic decisions for the company,'' Ms. Bhasin says. The idea is to \"contemplate a few steps ahead.\"</p><p>Stan Pavlovsky</p><p>CEO of Shutterstock Inc.</p><p>Mr. Oringer connected with the Meredith Corp. executive via LinkedIn in 2018—the year he started a search for his eventual successor.</p><p>When they first met, Mr. Pavlovsky suggested Mr. Oringer focus on a few valuable ideas because Shutterstock \"can't do it all,'' he recollects.</p><p>\"We were doing a lot at once,\" Mr. Oringer agrees. \"We had too many projects.\"</p><p>In 2019, Shutterstock hired Mr. Pavlovsky as co-chief operating officer and head of strategic operations. Months later, he advanced to president and COO.</p><p>But Mr. Oringer took time to digest the shift \"in how we were going to run the company and get comfortable with doing less,'' Mr. Pavlovsky says. The new second-in-command ultimately killed several technology projects that lacked the potential to improve customers' experience.</p><p>He took charge of Shutterstock in April of 2020.</p><p>Deirdre Bigley</p><p>A corporate director and investor</p><p>Ms. Bigley, whom Mr. Oringer recruited for Shutterstock's board five years ago, counseled him extensively about his decision to relinquish the CEO role.</p><p>\"It was tough,\" he says. They explored \"where I was going to be the most successful over the next 10 to 20 years of my career,'' he continues. He concluded that he especially enjoys the experience of creating businesses, bringing them to life and helping them grow.</p><p>In addition, she coached Mr. Oringer about how someone accustomed to being highly involved in the business could become an effective executive chairman.</p><p>\"We talked a lot about the balance between staying in close touch with the company but allowing the new CEO to make changes and sweat the details,'' says Ms. Bigley, a former chief marketing officer for Bloomberg LP. \"It was a giant step for Jon.\"</p><p>She warned Mr. Oringer that he might not always agree with the path chosen by his successor. Yet she knew their power-sharing arrangement could work \"because there was so much mutual respect.''</p><p>These days, Mr. Oringer says he has big ambitions. As he keeps guiding Shutterstock, he adds, he intends to help \"give birth to hundreds more businesses.\"</p><p>Write to Joann S.
