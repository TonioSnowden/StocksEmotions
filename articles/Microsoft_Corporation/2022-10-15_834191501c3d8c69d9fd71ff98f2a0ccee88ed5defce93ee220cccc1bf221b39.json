  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Want to Get Ahead? Pick the Right Company --- The 50 best places to climb the career ladder, get prepped for opportunities elsewhere or find job stability. College degrees not necessarily required.",
  "text": "<p>Getting ahead, the study concludes, is largely a matter of picking the right company. Tracking which companies provide more mobility could be critical for workers as the labor market loosens, companies slow hiring and the future of the U.S. economy becomes more uncertain. A weaker labor market means fewer options for workers, making initial career choices that much more important. Employers could develop a hiring advantage if they can demonstrate the ability to identify and advance new recruits, especially Americans without college degrees who have the skills for higher-wage work.</p><p>The release of these findings follows an examination of workers at more than 200 of the biggest U.S. companies conducted by Burning Glass Institute, a nonprofit launched earlier this year to research employment trends, along with the Harvard Project on Managing the Future of Work and the Schultz Family Foundation, the philanthropy started by longtime Starbucks Corp. leader Howard Schultz. It was their first attempt at such a study, using data from the Labor Department and self-reported data available from LinkedIn, Glassdoor and other online sources during the period from 2017 to 2021.</p><p>Burning Glass and its partners assigned scores to nine categories, such as how many promotions employees received and the average time it took to move up one job level. The goal was to identify which employers were best at helping their workers advance professionally and economically, particularly those who may not have a college degree. The authors said the study has limits because LinkedIn and other data sources don't capture every employee, but they said those limitations don't benefit certain companies over others.</p><p>\"Where you work turns out to be one of those decisions that really has big consequences, but the problem is that workers don't have the visibility to make an informed choice,\" said Burning Glass Institute President Matt Sigelman, who founded the employment research organization after years of running a labor-market analytics firm now called Lightcast, which primarily sells data to employers, government agencies and universities. \"Whether you wind up at a company that's an escalator for mobility or a treadmill,\" he added, \"for a lot of workers it's a crapshoot.\"</p><p>The companies that provided the most mobility, according to the study, were among the most familiar names in corporate America. Telecommunications giant AT&amp;T Inc., credit-card networker American Express Co. and network-equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. had the three highest composite scores in what Burning Glass calls the American Opportunity Index, with utility PG&amp;E Corp. and Microsoft Corp. rounding out the top five. All, even the top performers, showed areas where they could improve.</p><p>At AT&amp;T, there are tens of thousands of installers, retail-store clerks and other front-line workers among its more than 172,000 employees, said Angela Santone, AT&amp;T's senior executive vice president for human resources, and fewer than 5% of job openings require college degrees. The company trains new hires in many roles, and top managers often are recruited from company ranks. That includes Chief Executive John Stankey, who does have a college degree and started at the company more than three decades ago taking customer requests for phone service.</p><p>\"You can come in and become a tech on the front line, you can work in a retail store, and you can work in a call center,\" Ms. Santone said. \"We're very much about bringing individuals in and then training them.\"</p><p>The companies that did well in Burning Glass's analysis typically generated opportunities for workers in certain ways. Three common corporate profiles as defined by Burning Glass were companies that provided employees with the ability to ascend within their ranks; companies that served as a launchpad to outside opportunities; or companies that provided job stability.</p><p>Here is a closer look at some firms that fit those descriptions, as ranked by Burning Glass.</p><p>Companies that grow from within</p><p>Measuring mobility is important because companies tend to focus more on filling immediate needs than identifying people with the skills to move beyond that initial job, according to Burning Glass.</p><p>When people from four-year universities are hired into entry-level sales, technical or management jobs \"you'll be trained for advancement,\" said Byron Auguste, chief executive and co-founder of Opportunity@Work, a nonprofit organization that focuses on increasing economic mobility for people without college degrees. But for people emerging from high school, community college programs or other forms of training, \"you most likely will be in an entry-level retail, warehouse, or factory floor job, and you're trained for safety, compliance and efficiency, and not for advancement.\"</p><p>But some companies studied by Burning Glass provided a path forward. To gauge which large companies offered the most opportunity for advancement to new or inexperienced hires, Burning Glass looked at several factors. It examined the share of hires over time that arrive with little to no work experience, the number of promotions to better-paying jobs that workers experienced over the course of the study, and how quickly a worker at the company rose one level.</p><p>One industry that did well in this specific assessment of \"best workplaces to advance within\" was retail, which absorbs millions of inexperienced and new workers with entry-level associate and cashier jobs. Gap, Nordstrom Inc. and Macy's Inc. are among the retailers that scored highly. Verizon Communications Inc. and AT&amp;T, both telecommunications firms with large retail operations, also did well.</p><p>Two direct retail competitors -- discount chains Dollar General Corp. and Dollar Tree Inc. -- fared differently. Dollar General, a company with more than 18,000 stores in the U.S., did better in a measure of how many promotions a typical employee received in the five-year period of the analysis, making it one of the top companies providing opportunities for workers to grow.</p><p>Dollar Tree didn't make that list, but it made another: which companies offered the most opportunity to people without college degrees.</p><p>Dollar Tree spokesman Randy Guiler said the company provides financial support for education, including tuition discounts and reimbursement allowances for full-time associates, along with a range of development opportunities. He said the executive team, which has new leaders in place across many functions, is focused on changing the company's culture and better supporting its workers.</p><p>One former worker, Ashley O'Neal, said she was never encouraged to apply for openings. She was a store manager at a Dollar Tree in Virginia until leaving in 2018. During her employment, she said, she didn't receive training on how to improve her management skills or run the store more effectively. Mr. Guiler declined to comment on Ms. O'Neal's experience.</p><p>At Dollar General, employees move up frequently and quickly in part due to the pace of store openings, said Kathy Reardon, the retailer's chief people officer. The company has in recent years filled more than 2,000 new manager and assistant manager positions annually.</p><p>It mostly plucks from its existing workforce. Around 75% of Dollar General's store managers were internal promotions or lateral moves, she said. Chief Operating Officer Jeff Owen, who will take over the chief executive role on Nov. 1, started at the company in 1992 as a store manager trainee.</p><p>On average, a part-time sales associate can be promoted to lead associate within six months, then to assistant manager within one year and to store manager within three years. Dollar General also provides training for every upward move.</p><p>Donna Hernandez was a 19-year-old waitress with a high school diploma when she was offered a job as a part-time associate at a Dollar General in Bridgeport, Tex., in 1998. Within a year, she was managing the store. Today she is a divisional vice president of store operations, overseeing around 2,400 locations in Tennessee, Kentucky and neighboring states.</p><p>\"I'm living proof you can start at sales associate and go down the path you want to,\" said Ms. Hernandez, now 43. \"All the resources are right here, the training and development, the mentorship.\"</p><p>Not all of Dollar General's rankings were high. Like most retailers in the Fortune 250, Dollar General was in the lowest quintile for retention. Ms. Reardon declined to share the turnover rate for store jobs, but said it is improving.</p><p>Companies that offer workers a 'launchpad'</p><p>Some companies were springboards to better jobs elsewhere. These \"launchpad\" companies, as Burning Glass defines them, tended to hire more entry-level employees and see departing employees land jobs in better-paying occupations at other companies, Burning Glass found.</p><p>At AT&amp;T, which ranked among the top 50 launchpad companies, entry-level workers often gain skills they can take to other telecommunications, cable, retail or customer-service companies, said Ms. Santone, the human-resources executive.</p><p>\"I personally think that's a compliment to this company,\" she added. \"At the end of the day, I want them here, but I don't look at all turnover as bad.\"</p>",
