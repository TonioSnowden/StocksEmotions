  "title": "Small Bank Fuels Skyscraper Boom --- OZK of Arkansas is one of the most prolific lenders of mortgages for tower construction",
  "text": "<p>OZK is nearing a deal to issue a $410 million loan to Rabina, the developer of a roughly 1,000-foot-tall Manhattan office and luxury residential tower on Fifth Avenue, which would be one of its largest loans, the bank said.</p><p>The lender is one of a group of regional banks and debt funds that are propelling the recent surge in commercial real-estate development. Proposed New York City construction in the fourth quarter, for instance, totaled nearly 32 million square feet, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, the city's most for a single quarter since 2014, the trade association said.</p><p>OZK and its peers \"are really the engine that drives the construction business,\" said Steven Buchwald, a senior managing director at real-estate finance brokerage Mission Capital.</p><p>Seven years ago these, midsize banks held less construction debt than the largest banks. Now they hold far more, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. data shows. Others fueling the boom include Centennial Bank in Conway, Ark.; Los Angeles-based Pacific Western Bank; and Laredo, Texas-based International Bank of Commerce, where construction loans account for 25% of its loans.</p><p>They are helping fill a void left by the biggest banks, which often shy away from development loans because these projects tend to be among the riskiest. Projects can take years to complete and don't produce any income in the meantime.</p><p>OZK's $7.7 billion in construction and land-development loans made up 42% of all loans on its balance sheet as of September. That is the highest percentage for any bank with more than $5 billion in assets, and more than 10 times the weighted industry average. The Little Rock lender holds more construction debt than Citibank, which is about 65 times as large, in terms of assets.</p><p>Unlike bigger banks, OZK doesn't usually ask borrowers to pledge their personal wealth as collateral, and it doesn't sell off parts of a loan to other lenders, according to brokers who have worked with the bank. That helps it win business, but it also means OZK has more exposure in the event of a default.</p><p>OZK said it can minimize that risk by funding about half a project's cost on average, leaving the rest to other investors, as well as by backing experienced developers and insisting that it gets paid first in the event of a default. Only 0.2% of the bank's loans were nonperforming as of December. Last year, the bank's profit hit a record, company filings show.</p><p>Mr. Gleason, born into a moderately wealthy family in rural Arkansas, started his career as an attorney. At age 25, he bought a controlling stake in a small community lender called Bank of Ozark for $10,000 and a $3.6 million loan, backed by his family estate and bank shares. Over the years the bank grew, winning over depositors with the help of aggressive advertising and sales practices. He took it public in 1997.</p><p>The bank opened a New York office in 2013. Since then, the value of construction loans on its balance sheet has grown roughly 10-fold, according to public filings.</p><p>Mr. Gleason held shares in the bank valued at more than $260 million as of last March, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. He owns a 30,000-square-foot French-style mansion on over 100 acres of land in Little Rock that has 14 bathrooms, a chapel, a fountain, and an expansive collection of European art, according to property records and people who have been to the home.</p><p>Some economists worry about the rise of these smaller lenders. They say rules designed to tamp down risk after the 2008 financial crisis simply diverted it elsewhere. Forced to hold more capital and hire more compliance staff, smaller lenders' costs have risen and their margins have shrunk. Low interest rates and competition from nonbank lenders also have made it harder to make money with community-bank staples like home mortgages and consumer loans.</p><p>This means banks looking to expand their business have a stronger incentive to issue construction loans, where competition is smaller and returns higher.</p><p>\"Think of it as a perverse effect of the broader regulatory clampdown on banks,\" said Jonathon Adams-Kane, an economist formerly at the Milken Institute who has studied real-estate lending by U.S. banks.</p><p>Between 2013 and the third quarter of 2021, midsize banks more than tripled their construction and land-development loans to $128.4 billion, surging past the largest banks. These construction loans now make up 6.6% of their loans, up from 2.9% in 2013, according to FDIC data.</p><p>OZK's biggest deals include a $664 million construction loan in 2019 for a massive mixed-use project in Tampa backed by Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeff Vinik and Bill Gates's Cascade Investment LLC, and a $558 million construction loan in 2018 for a condo project in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla.</p><p>At the Manhattan site at 520 Fifth Avenue, private-equity firm Carlyle Group is chipping in $130 million on top of OZK's loan. The development sits on a street that has suffered from the absence of tourists and office workers during the pandemic. Still, OZK President Brannon Hamblen said the Manhattan apartment market has weathered the pandemic well. He expects strong demand for office space in the newest, most modern buildings.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
