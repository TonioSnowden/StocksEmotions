  "text": "<p>PayPal, the online payments company, is in talks to acquire social media group Pinterest for about $45bn, in what could result in one of the largest corporate takeover deals of the year, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.</p> <p>Pinterest's board received a mainly stock-based $70 a share offer from PayPal, which is seeking to capitalise on its relatively high share price as currency for a transaction. The timing of the approach remained uncertain. </p> <p>Shares in Pinterest jumped more than 13 per cent to $63.31 on the news of the talks, which were first reported by Bloomberg. PayPal stock fell more than 5 per cent. The share price rise gave Pinterest a market capitalisation of more than $40bn.</p> <p>Pinterest declined to comment. PayPal did not respond to requests for comment. </p> <p>PayPal recently acquired <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdeccd3c-fe41-4228-ad11-9efc6f5c9d2d\">Paidy</a>, a Japanese “buy now, pay later” company for $2.7bn, as it seeks to move into the popular financial service that allows consumers to spread costs over a period of time, usually without paying interest. </p> <p>The company has been using its strong stock price, which grew more than 150 per cent since the low of March 2020, to fuel its acquisition strategy to become a super app such as China's WeChat, which offers payments and also acts as a social media platform. </p> <p>In July, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/398c5fa2-8ee5-4eaa-9fe7-04bb4ef996e5\">Dan Schulman</a>, PayPal's president, said “consumer wallet super app” was being rolled out in the US with savings, ecommerce, cryptocurrency and messaging capabilities. The company is also in the early stages of building a stock trading platform, said people familiar with the matter. </p> <p>Pinterest has more than 450m users, who can post — or pin — images of their interests on to boards and message others. It has also been deepening its push into ecommerce with new shopping tools.</p> <p>Since making its stock market <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52cf4b30-6170-11e9-b285-3acd5d43599e\">debut</a> in April 2019, Pinterest's shares have almost trebled. Its business initially benefited from the pandemic as stay-at-home mandates forced people to shop online, but it has had difficulty keeping up momentum.</p> <p>The San Francisco-based company's July earnings report fell short of Wall Street's expectations with lower than expected user growth, wiping about $8bn from its market value in a single day. </p> <p>News of the deal talks comes a week after Evan Sharp, Pinterest's co-founder and design chief, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5164e196-4279-4d16-a787-03a0a0745687\">announced</a> that he was stepping down from his role. The company has recently faced criticism over its internal culture, including allegations of gender discrimination from former employees. </p> <p>The Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f88b8474-e791-4efb-a9f6-54c8222680fe\">reported earlier this year </a>that Microsoft had also approached Pinterest about a potential deal as it sought to build a portfolio of active online communities, though talks were not active at the time. </p><p>Source: James Fontanella-Khan in Los Angeles, Hannah Murphy in San Francisco and Ortenca Aliaj in New York 2021 'PayPal in talks with Pinterest on takeover worth $45bn' FT.com 20 October.
