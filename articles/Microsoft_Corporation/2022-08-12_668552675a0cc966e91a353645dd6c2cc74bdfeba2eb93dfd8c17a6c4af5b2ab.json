  "title": "This 'crying CEO' has gone viral, but says he wasn't trying to 'make it about me'; HyperSocial chief executive Braden Wallake shared an emotional post on LinkedIn after having to fire some of his employees",
  "text": "<p>Wallake said the layoffs were his fault, because of a decision he made in February and \"stuck with for far too long.\"</p><p>\"So, I just want people to see that not every CEO out there is cold-hearted and doesn't care when he/she have to lay people off,\" Wallake said in the post.</p><p>He added: \"I've always hire (sic) people based on who they are as people. People with great hearts, and great souls.\"</p><p>Some praised Wallake for his emotional post, but others found it self-indulgent and worthy of parody — and Wallake was soon given the \"crying CEO\" moniker. The CryingCEO hashtag also went viral on other social platforms, with lots of pointed comments, such as this one.</p><p>Wallake followed up with another LinkedIn post in which he said the intent of his original post \"was not to make it about me or victimize myself. I am sorry it came across that way.\"</p><p>MarketWatch reached out to Wallake for additional comment, but he wasn't immediately available.</p><p>Human-resources experts and other business professionals say crying is inevitable in some workplace situations. In that regard, it's perhaps no surprise that executives might also be the ones crying — or that the tears can spill onto social media.</p><p>Still, a 2018 Civic Science study found that 51% of those surveyed didn't think crying at work was acceptable. At the same time, 57% of survey respondents admitted they had shed tears at the office. The study also noted that 34% of managers surveyed had cried at work.</p><p>This 'crying CEO' has gone viral, but says he wasn't trying to 'make it about me'</p>",
