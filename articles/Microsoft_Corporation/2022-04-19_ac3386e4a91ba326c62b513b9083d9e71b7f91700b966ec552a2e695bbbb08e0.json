  "title": "U.S. News: Coal-to-Nuclear Pitch Gains Traction --- Utilities and startups try to sell the idea of electricity generation, but skeptics abound",
  "text": "<p>Following lobbying efforts by industry, lawmakers in more than a dozen states this year are considering legislation that would open the door to coal-to-nuclear conversions.</p><p>Dozens of small-modular-reactor developers globally are testing designs, and Russia has two SMRs producing electricity, though they took years longer to deliver than expected. There are no SMRs making electricity in the U.S., and none under construction. At the earliest, U.S. reactors could be available later this decade. Supporters say the smaller-scale reactors could prove cheaper and faster to build than their massive predecessors; skeptics say the effort is a gamble on a technology with unproven economics.</p><p>The sales pitch is that mini-nuclear reactors could tie into existing transmission lines and electric substations, while former coal-plant workers could retrain to operate small nuclear plants, saving jobs and the local tax base. Nuclear fission can generate energy without greenhouse-gas emissions, and unlike other technologies such as solar, it can do so 24 hours a day.</p><p>Even proponents concede it is far from certain that the smaller reactors can be built faster and cheaper than existing nuclear plants.</p><p>\"For us that may be the most important question, and one that should be asked and discussed openly,\" said Jeff Lyash, chief executive of the Tennessee Valley Authority.</p><p>Small reactors would use a modular design that -- if proven -- could be replicated quickly. TVA's new nuclear program includes plans for a small lightwater reactor, which it thinks could start delivering power between 2030 and 2034, with the addition of identical reactors that decade \"as we're retiring the remaining coal,\" Mr. Lyash said.</p><p>TerraPower LLC, which is backed by Bill Gates, plans to join with the operator of a closing coal plant to train workers to operate a reactor in Kemmerer, Wyo.</p><p>\"We get access to a workforce that knows how to run power plants, knows how to produce electricity,\" said Jeff Navin, TerraPower's director of external affairs.</p><p>Doug Hunter, chief executive of Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems, a consortium of mostly city-owned utilities in Western states, said microreactors would complement renewables. UAMPS is working with developer NuScale Power LLC to develop SMRs at the Idaho National Laboratory.</p><p>\"We can have a lot more solar and wind in our portfolio, and then have the backup and reliability,\" Mr. Hunter said.</p><p>Developers will have to navigate a complex licensing process at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Most planned projects have delivery dates that begin later this decade, a timeline that misses many coal shutdowns. About 6% of the coal-fired generating capacity that was operating at the end of 2021 is expected to retire this year, around 12.6 gigawatts, according to the federal government.</p><p>\"This is in many respects a false solution to climate change because it's not ready yet,\" said Kerwin Olson, executive director at the Citizens Action Coalition in Indiana, a consumer watchdog group.</p><p>Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear-power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said projects would pose some level of risk to communities, and some say local opposition is a potential hurdle to new nuclear plants.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
