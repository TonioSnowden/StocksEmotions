  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis:  Western Companies  Offer Skills, Services  To Counter Assault  ----  By David Uberti, Denise Roland and Patience Haggin",
  "text": "<p>   Western companies including Microsoft Corp., GlaxoSmithKline PLC and SpaceX are offering assistance to Ukraine, helping guard against cyberattacks, providing painkillers and setting up internet services amid Russia's continuing assault. </p><p>   Some of the efforts go beyond contributing humanitarian assistance or extending financial support to aid groups, with broader moves that could complicate companies' relationships with Russia or risk reputational damage should the endeavors fail. </p><p>   Hours before Russian tanks entered Ukrainian territory, researchers at Microsoft discovered a never-before-seen type of malicious software, which they dubbed FoxBlade, used in attempted cyberattacks against Ukraine's digital infrastructure. </p><p>   Tom Burt, the U.S. tech giant's vice president of customer security and trust, said he contacted Ukrainian defense and intelligence officials through a secure channel to alert them of the \"wiper malware.\" Mr. Burt said he also contacted Anne Neuberger, a White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, and that she connected him with officials at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and European Union. A White House spokeswoman confirmed the account but didn't comment further. </p><p>   Drugmakers have also sought to aid the Ukrainian government. Over the weekend, Ukrainian officials asked pharmaceutical companies for supplies to treat traumatic injuries. GlaxoSmithKline said it donated doses of antibiotic Augmentin and painkiller Panadol. </p><p>   The drugs will be included alongside medicine from other drugmakers and items such as wound dressings in emergency medical packs assembled by Direct Relief, a humanitarian group that provides medical supplies in disaster zones. Glaxo, like other drugmakers, typically donates medicines during humanitarian crises. </p><p>   European airline Ryanair Holdings PLC is carrying medical supplies, food and personal-protective equipment among other humanitarian supplies on its flights to Poland, including to Warsaw and Krakow. The company is working with Ukrainian embassies to facilitate immediate shipments of supplies across the border. </p><p>   French energy giant TotalEnergies SE, meanwhile, is providing fuel to Ukrainian authorities. The company has condemned Moscow's attack and said it would no longer provide capital for new projects in Russia. However, TotalEnergies stopped short of saying it would exit its Russian joint ventures, as rivals Exxon Mobil Corp., BP PLC and Shell PLC have said they would do. </p><p>   Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp., as SpaceX is formally known, has made its Starlink satellite-internet system available in Ukraine. It has also sent additional equipment so people can use the service, which requires terminals on the ground that connect to satellites. </p><p>   Some professionals are taking matters into their own hands. A group of digital-advertising workers have organized a volunteer effort to counter misinformation about the conflict in Russia by buying digital ads that divert locals to trusted news sources. </p><p></p>",
