  "text": "<p>At bike trade shows, where rivals greet passersby with swag, booze and food, Brompton reps armed with a spanner and some Allen wrenches show off their product to fellow bike nerds who then become passionate distributors. It's a slow but solid way to grow. Descriptions of manufacturing and sales sit alongside accounts of more universal executive challenges, from dealing with unions to a whiny board. The overarching lesson of Brompton is that the company's culture follows the efficiency of the bike itself. The product shapes the firm.</p><p>Will Guidara, a former co-owner of the celebrated New York restaurant Eleven Madison Park, offers his take on customer service in \"Unreasonable Hospitality.\" His subtitle, \"The Remarkable Power of Giving People More Than They Expect,\" signals the roller-coaster pages that follow.</p><p>The book opens in 2010. Mr. Guidara and his business partner, chef Daniel Humm, are devastated by the experience of being ranked 50th at a ceremony naming the 50 best restaurants in the world. Scrambling up that list, they realized, would take more than hard work.</p><p>Eleven Madison Park's evolution over the ensuing years into the best restaurant in the world was built on detail. The lighting inside was adjusted throughout dinner as the sun set. Traffic patterns for servers walking amidst the tables were detailed and drilled. Waiters were taught the importance of laying a plate perfectly in front of a customer, not allowing anything to slip and thereby ruin that one final moment of presentation.</p><p>Mr. Guidara also had to manage Mr. Humm, a brilliant but temperamental figure schooled in European kitchens where \"screaming and humiliation . . . were standard workplace conditions.\" When he saw his chef throw an incorrectly plated crab roulade into the face of a cook, Mr. Guidara dragged him down the hallway and threatened to resign.</p><p>Despite the occasional hokey tone, this is a lovely and impassioned book, full of insights for anyone trying to extract the very best out of people.</p><p>From the other end of the food business comes \"Hangry\" by Mike Evans, a founder of the delivery service Grubhub. His is the gonzo journey of an early aughts tech entrepreneur. He begins the book: \"I'm done. All-day meetings. All-night coding sessions. Midnight outages. Software bugs. Patent lawyers. Employees. Investors. Thousands of angry customers. Millions of happy ones. And pizza. So. Much. Pizza.\" After leading Grubhub to an IPO in 2014, Mr. Evans has left the company and is off on a bicycle ride across America.</p><p>This is a book about the awful grind of building a startup. Mr. Evans discusses his idea with his wife while they have $236,000 in student loans. He teaches himself by reading books like \"Selling for Dummies.\" He writes a business plan using a template in Microsoft Word called \"Microsoft Business Planner,\" with sections on sales forecasting, credible projections and customers. \"I s— you not . . . that's how I made my business plan. Somebody at Microsoft had decided to write a primer on starting a business and bury it deep in the bowels of the program, and I happened to happen upon it.\"</p><p>Mr. Evans is constantly learning on the job, about managing a growing workforce and the \"meaningless corporate drivel about company values.\" He puts technology at the heart of the business and gets investment from Silicon Valley. And then on that bike trip, physically and emotionally depleted, he reflects on the purpose of it all. Did he aim high enough? Does the financial reward make up for the personal cost? After a few years off, Mr. Evans is ready to do it all again.</p><p>\"Inside Vanguard\" is one for the mutual-fund junkie. No basis point is left unturned by author Charles Ellis, a consultant to financial institutions. Vanguard now manages over $8 trillion in assets on behalf of 30 million investors. The firm treats money management as an industrial practice: three-quarters of its assets are index funds, where low costs and scale are paramount.</p><p>The color in Mr. Ellis's book is provided by Vanguard's celebrated founder, John Bogle, who comes across as a gifted narcissist obsessed with his place in history. Bogle (1929-2019) had a searing youth, watching his family come apart under financial stress. He responded by focusing on work. \"Late in life,\" Mr. Ellis writes, \"he still believed ranking second is not good enough and cited a crossword definition of 'came in second' as 'lost.' \"</p><p>Bogle founded Vanguard in 1975 after a vicious falling-out with his previous employer Wellington Management. He insisted that Vanguard grow organically rather than through acquisitions—and ran his firm as thriftily as he ran his personal life. \"I do not like to spend money,\" he once said. That dictum ran through Vanguard's entire culture, from its threadbare offices to the low-cost funds offered to its delighted customers.</p><p>Vanguard's story under Bogle and his successors is one of efficiency and scale. When you run $8 trillion, the slightest adjustment in fees can result in astounding amounts of capital to invest, leaving your competitors floundering and murmuring to regulators about the dangers of monopolies.</p><p>Mr. Delves Broughton is the author of \"The Art of the Sale: Learning From the Masters About the Business of Life.\"</p><p>Holiday Gift Books: Business</p>",
