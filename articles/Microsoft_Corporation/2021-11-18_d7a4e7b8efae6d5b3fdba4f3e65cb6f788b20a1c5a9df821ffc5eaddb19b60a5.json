  "title": "When Will the Kyle Rittenhouse Verdict Be Announced? The jury is currently deliberating on the case in Kenosha, Wis., to decide what happens to the teenager who killed two men",
  "text": "<p>Judge Bruce Schroeder dismissed the misdemeanor charge of possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 17 years old. The defense had argued a person of that age could carry such a weapon under Wisconsin law as long as it wasn't a short-barreled rifle. After the prosecution conceded that the AR-15-style rifle didn't have a short barrel, Judge Schroeder dropped the charge. The judge also agreed to allow prosecutors to offer jurors a number of less serious charges to consider if they can't agree on the more serious charges.</p><p>When will the verdict be announced?</p><p>The jury resumed deliberation, now in its third day, at just after 9 a.m. local time. The jury started deliberations on Tuesday, Nov. 16. Judge Schroeder released jurors for the night on Wednesday around 4:30 p.m. local time, after two full days of deliberations. The earliest a verdict could come would be Thursday.</p><p>Why did MSNBC get barred from the courthouse?</p><p>Judge Schroeder on Thursday barred MSNBC from the courthouse after a producer with ties to the network on Wednesday evening had run a red light while following the bus that takes jurors away from the courthouse to another location at the end of each night.</p><p>The judge said the bus has covered windows, so the jury isn't swayed by the demonstrators or swarm of media around the courthouse.</p><p>The judge identified the producer as James J. Morrison. A LinkedIn profile for Jamie Morrison says he works as a producer for NBC News and the Weather Channel.</p><p>\"Last night, a freelancer received a traffic citation,\" said a spokesman for NBC News. \"While the traffic violation took place near the jury van, the freelancer never contacted or intended to contact the jurors during deliberations, and never photographed or intended to photograph them. We regret the incident and will fully cooperate with the authorities on any investigation.\"</p><p>What happened on Wednesday?</p><p>The jury resumed their deliberations shortly after 9 a.m. local time.</p><p>A few hours later, the jury asked to see some of the video evidence in the case. The defense argued that one piece of drone footage shouldn't be presented because the copy they received from the prosecution was shorter and of lower quality than the prosecution had access to. The prosecution later said that they attempted to transfer the full video and that they can't be held responsible for any compression that happened during transmission or playback by the defense.</p><p>\"As far as we knewâ€¦everyone had the exact same copy,\" said Assistant District Attorney James Kraus.</p><p>The defense referenced the handling of the video on Monday in a written motion for a mistrial with prejudice, meaning the case couldn't be retried if the motion were granted. The defense also cited two other alleged missteps by prosecutors: its effort to introduce a video in which Mr. Rittenhouse discusses his desire to shoot certain people he suspected of shoplifting, which the judge had previously said was inadmissible, and a line of questioning that seemed to impugn Mr. Rittenhouse's right to remain silent after his arrest.</p><p>Judge Schroeder also discussed criticism he has received for failing to address the motion for a mistrial. The judge said he can't make a ruling until he gets a brief from the prosecution on the matter.</p><p>He also said that a motion for mistrial, unless the answer is crystal clear, is normally taken under advisement by the judge.</p><p>Judge Schroeder dismissed criticism that he wouldn't allow the people shot by Mr. Rittenhouse to be referred to as victims, a practice some other judges follow on the principle that it prejudices the jury.</p><p>\"How would you like to be put on trial for a crime and the judge introduced the case to the jury by introducing you as the defendant, and the person who's accusing you as a victim?\" he said. \"Is it so difficult to just use the term complaining witnesses instead of prejudging what the jury is here to determine as to whether there's a victim and whether there was a crime committed?\"</p><p>He also defended his decision to allow Mr. Rittenhouse to pull the names of alternate jurors from a tumbler, saying that he had been using that practice for 20 years.</p><p>Later that afternoon, the defense made a new motion for a mistrial, this time without prejudice, meaning the case could be retried, saying that it would have tried the case differently if it had received the higher-definition video. The judge said he would consider the motion.</p><p>What are the charges the jury is deliberating on?</p><p>Mr. Rittenhouse faces charges of intentional, reckless and attempted homicide, and reckless endangerment. He has pleaded not guilty, and his attorneys have argued he acted in self-defense.</p><p>What are the possible verdict outcomes for Mr. Rittenhouse?</p><p>Mr. Rittenhouse is being tried as an adult. These are the possible penalties he faces if found guilty on any of the following counts:</p><p>* COUNT 1: Guilty or not guilty of reckless homicide of the first degree, relating to Joseph Rosenbaum, who was the first person Mr. Rittenhouse shot. This felony charge is punishable by up to 60 years in prison. Mr. Rittenhouse testified that Mr. Rosenbaum had threatened to kill him and another man if he caught them alone earlier in the evening. The prosecution said there is no video evidence of that exchange in a night that was well-documented. Mr. Rittenhouse also said that Mr. Rosenbaum was lunging at him to take away his rifle and that Mr. Rosenbaum had his hand on Mr. Rittenhouse's rifle when Mr. Rittenhouse began shooting. The prosecution alleged that the first shot came as Mr. Rosenbaum was still 4 feet away from the barrel of the gun.</p><p>* COUNT 2: Guilty or not guilty of reckless endangerment of the first degree, relating to Richie McGinniss of the Daily Caller. This felony charge is punishable by 12.5 years in prison. Mr. McGinniss was behind Mr. Rosenbaum when Mr. Rittenhouse began shooting. Mr. McGinniss testified that he sensed something whiz by one of his legs and had to check his legs to make sure he wasn't shot. The defense argued that if Mr. Rittenhouse was found to have been lawfully defending himself in the shooting of Mr. Rosenbaum, he couldn't be found guilty of the charge involving Mr. McGinniss.</p><p>* COUNT 3: Guilty or not guilty of reckless endangerment of the first degree, relating to an unknown person who was referred to during the trial as \"Jumpkick Guy.\" This felony charge is punishable by 12.5 years in prison. This person jumped up and kicked Mr. Rittenhouse after he had stumbled and fell to the ground, as shown in video and other evidence in the case. Mr. Rittenhouse fired at the man and missed.</p><p>* COUNT 4: Guilty or not guilty of intentional homicide of the first degree, the most serious charge, relating to Anthony Huber, who hit Mr. Rittenhouse with a skateboard. If the jury can't agree on count four, they can go to the lesser included charges of intentional homicide of the second degree or reckless homicide of the first degree. This charge is punishable by up to 60 years in prison. Mr. Huber hit Mr. Rittenhouse with a skateboard and attempted to wrest his gun away, after Mr. Rittenhouse fell in the street, according to the criminal complaint. The defense called the skateboard a dangerous weapon and said Mr. Huber was trying to take Mr. Rittenhouse's head off. Video evidence showed that Mr. Huber had let go of the weapon and was heading away from Mr. Rittenhouse when Mr. Rittenhouse fired.</p><p>* COUNT 5: Guilty or not guilty of attempted intentional homicide of the first degree, relating to Gaige Grosskreutz, the third and last person that Mr. Rittenhouse shot. If the jury can't agree on count five, they can go to the lesser included charge of attempted intentional homicide of the second degree or reckless endangerment of the first degree. This charge is punishable by up to 60 years in prison. Mr. Grosskreutz testified that his gun was pointing in Mr. Rittenhouse's direction when Mr. Rittenhouse fired. The prosecution emphasized that he was reaching with his left hand toward the barrel of Mr. Rittenhouse's gun and never assumed a position that indicated he was preparing to fire the gun.</p><p>How were the jury members selected?</p><p>Jurors were randomly selected using a raffle drum with slips of paper containing the numbers of each of the 18 jurors who heard the two-week trial. Mr. Rittenhouse pulled six numbers from that drum, which were 11, 58, 14, 45, 9 and 52. Those numbers indicated the numbers of the jurors who were to be dismissed and were read out loud before the court. The remaining jurors were selected to decide the case beginning on Tuesday.</p><p>What happens if the jury can't agree?</p><p>Jury verdicts in criminal cases generally require all members of the jury to agree. If jurors can't reach an agreement, a judge can declare a mistrial, after which the prosecution would have to decide whether to retry Mr. Rittenhouse. Judges typically try to avoid a hung jury and may urge a jury to continue deliberating until a verdict is reached.</p><p>What were the missteps alleged by the defense?</p><p>During the trial, the first came as Assistant District Attorney Thomas Binger began asking Mr. Rittenhouse questions that described his testimony on the stand as the first time he had told his story. Judge Schroeder, responding to an objection from the defense, said these questions appeared to bring into question Mr. Rittenhouse's fundamental right not to incriminate himself.</p><p>Later that same day, Mr. Binger tried to introduce evidence that Mr. Rittenhouse had said two weeks before the shooting that he wished he had his gun with him to shoot some people he thought had been shoplifting. That brought a harsh and lengthy rebuke from the judge, who had earlier ruled that the evidence wasn't relevant to the case.</p><p>How is Kenosha preparing for the verdict?</p><p>Officials in Kenosha are preparing for the possibility of unrest after the verdict. On Friday, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers approved the deployment of 500 National Guard troops. They will be ready to be deployed into Kenosha if called upon by local authorities to back up hundreds of officers from volunteering local law-enforcement agencies providing public safety after the verdict, according to a release from the Wisconsin National Guard. The White House is in touch with state leaders about preparations for the verdict and is hopeful any protests will be peaceful, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.</p><p>Write to Anthony DeRosa at anthony.derosa@wsj.com and Joe Barrett at Joseph.Barrett@wsj.com</p><p>When Will the Kyle Rittenhouse Verdict Be Announced?</p>",
