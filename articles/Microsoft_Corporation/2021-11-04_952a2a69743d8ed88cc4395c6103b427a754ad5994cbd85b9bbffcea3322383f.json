  "title": "Russia Analyst Igor Danchenko Arrested in Connection With Steele Dossier; Special counsel John Durham makes third arrest in examination of investigation of 2016 Trump campaign",
  "text": "<p>The case represents the third prosecution related to Mr. Durham's investigation, which began in May 2019 when then-Attorney General William Barr appointed the Connecticut U.S. attorney to look into matters related to the investigation into Mr. Trump and his campaign associates.</p><p>Mr. Danchenko has previously been identified as Mr. Steele's \"primary sub-source\" in compiling a series of private intelligence reports documenting Mr. Trump's purported ties to Russia. Documents released by the Justice Department last year contained enough information for journalists and researchers to identify Mr. Danchenko, who had voluntarily spoken to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2017 under the condition that it protect his identity.</p><p>Mr. Steele's research was paid for by the Democratic Party and served as key evidence in a secret surveillance warrant that was obtained against Carter Page, a onetime foreign-policy adviser to Mr. Trump. Many of the dossier's claims remain unverified. Mr. Trump has denied the allegations in the dossier and said the investigation it helped spark was a \"witch hunt.\"</p><p>Mr. Danchenko, born in Russia and trained as a lawyer there, has worked and studied in the U.S. since 2003, according to his LinkedIn profile. He holds masters degrees from Georgetown University and University of Louisville and has worked at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. More recently, he has worked as an independent risk analyst dealing with due-diligence and business-intelligence issues.</p><p>The specific charges filed against Mr. Danchenko couldn't be immediately determined. A lawyer for Mr. Danchenko had no immediate comment on the arrest.</p><p>Aruna Viswanatha contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com</p><p>Russia Analyst Igor Danchenko Arrested in Connection With Steele Dossier</p>",
