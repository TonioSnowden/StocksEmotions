  "title": "Heard on the Street:  Activision Gets Some Protection  ---  'Call of Duty' improves game maker's prospects if Microsoft deal falls through  ----  By Dan Gallagher",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Fantasy videogames can still inflict real-world wounds, but a 19-year-old franchise is also proving very hard to kill. </p><p>\n   Activision Blizzard's latest \"Call of Duty\" iteration is selling strong, which marks a notable comeback after last year's flop. The game publisher said Monday that \"Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II\" surpassed $1 billion in global sell-through in 10 days from its Oct. 28 release, crossing that threshold faster than any previous version of the game. </p><p>\n  Later in the day, the company reported stronger-than-expected net bookings for the third quarter and projected growth of at least 20% year over year for the fourth quarter. It also confirmed that it will make a \"Call of Duty\" game in 2023, countering previous reports that it was planning to skip a year in what has historically been a steady cadence of annual releases. </p><p>\n  The news predictably didn't do much for Activision's stock on Tuesday given its still-pending acquisition by Microsoft. Perversely, the game's success might even be mixed news on that front since a stronger \"Call of Duty\" could fuel more worries about the Xbox maker eventually making the game exclusive to that platform. Sony, which makes the rival PlayStation platform, has been pushing to have the deal blocked on the grounds it could lose access to the blockbuster franchise. But that has never been Microsoft's aim with the deal; Xbox Chief Executive Phil Spencer told The Wall Street Journal's Tech Live conference last month that he even wants to see \"Call of Duty\" on the Nintendo Switch and be much larger in mobile. </p><p>\n  Still, worries about the deal's ultimate fate have kept a lid on Activision's stock. The shares have fetched a notable discount to the bid price since it was announced in January, and that discount has widened as regulators have stepped up their scrutiny. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority escalated its probe in September, and the European Commission on Tuesday announced its own in-depth investigation into the deal. Activision shares are now trading around 25% below Microsoft's offer price of $95. </p><p>\n  Wall Street analysts still largely expect the deal to pass. But a stronger \"Call of Duty\" puts Activision in a much better place should the transaction fail to gain the necessary approvals. The game generates about $3 billion in annual revenue between its console, free-to-play and mobile versions, according to consensus estimates at Visible Alpha. And the disappointing launch of \"Call of Duty: Vanguard\" last year -- which came soon after Activision was rocked by scandals involving sexual misconduct in the workplace -- was a major factor in denting the company's market value and creating an opportunity for the Microsoft deal. Clay Griffin of SVB Securities wrote Tuesday that Activision's improving performance creates a \"heads I win, tails I don't lose all that much scenario.\" </p><p>\n  Activision is getting some of its game back. </p><p></p>",
