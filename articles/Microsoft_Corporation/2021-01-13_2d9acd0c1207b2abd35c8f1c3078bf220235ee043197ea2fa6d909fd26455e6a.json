  "title": "Parler Faces Obstacles  Getting Back Online  ----  By Robert McMillan and Aaron Tilley",
  "text": "<p>   Parler, the social network popular among conservatives and other right-leaning users that was plunged into internet limbo this week, faces a technically complex and costly path to getting back online. </p><p>    Amazon.com Inc. booted the company from its cloud-computing service Sunday night, knocking Parler offline. To stay alive, the self-professed free-speech social platform must find a new vendor willing to host its data after some of the app's users stoked last week's deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters seeking to stop certification of the election results. Alternatively, Parler could build its own network infrastructure, although that approach could lead to further delays resuming its service. </p><p>   Potential cloud operators other than Amazon include Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google. The search-giant declined to comment. Last week it pulled Parler from its app store, saying some users' content incited violence -- the same argument Amazon made in withdrawing its service. Parler was still using Microsoft email services as of Monday. Microsoft said it has had no contact with Parler about hosting its data and wouldn't comment on customers using its email service. </p><p>   Parler also wouldn't run on Oracle Corp.'s growing cloud business, a person familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Tech companies are increasingly making decisions over the content they host and to whom they provide their services, sometimes in response to government requests or pressure from employees or others. Such moves have sometimes triggered their own backlash. </p><p>   Parler could turn to smaller, lower-profile cloud providers, though some in the tech industry say those services could struggle to support the app since its user numbers have surged after Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. blocked President Trump on those platforms. One such smaller vendor, New York-based DigitalOcean LLC, has signaled it wouldn't welcome Parler, saying the history of content on the app violated the cloud provider's terms of service. </p><p>   Social-media companies, like others, generally rely on a network of tech suppliers to deliver their online services. Those services range from data storage to more basic functions, such as connecting to the internet or registering domain names. Companies cut off from those services have options to remain online, though that can involve working with overseas vendors or accepting degraded functionality, industry professionals say. </p><p>   Parler's chief executive, John Matze, said the platform could be offline for a week as it rebuilds its service. Amazon, in its letter notifying Parler it would suspend service, said it was preserving the social-media company's data and would assist in migrating it elsewhere.On Monday Parler sued Amazon over the suspension, alleging anticompetitive motives and political animus, claims that the tech giant called meritless. </p><p>   Cloud experts say the odds are against Parler restoring its full service in such a short time. </p><p>   \"It isn't happening any time soon,\" said Corey Quinn of the Duckbill Group, a company that helps customers manage their Amazon cloud services. Shifting everything involved in running a system like Parler could take at least six months, he said. \"This is not setting up a blog post and putting that up on the web.\" </p><p>   Mr. Matze said the company planned to move to a new cloud-service provider and had multiple options he didn't name. </p><p>   Parler isn't the first company to be forced to find ways to operate after tech companies shunned it. The app could follow a path similar to Gab more than two years ago when that social-media platform was dropped by its cloud provider, Joyent, after a gunman murdered 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue. The alleged shooter used Gab to post anti-Semitic and Holocaust-denying messages and said on the platform, \"Screw your optics, I'm going in\" shortly before the attack. </p><p>   Gab, which also had billed itself as a venue for free expression, eventually resurfaced using a technology setup that was reminiscent of those in the early 2000s. Instead of the cloud, Gab hosted its service on racks of servers in a room rented from an undisclosed data center. </p><p>   Gab also uses some internet service providers to stay online. The company's domain name is registered by Epik Inc., and its online content is protected from attack and sped up over the internet by Cloudflare Inc.On Sunday, Parler moved its domain name registration to Epik, the domain registration company's chief executive, Rob Monster, told The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   Epik drew criticism in 2019 for providing internet services to 8chan, the forum used by suspects in three mass shootings, including one that killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. Epik later dropped 8chan as a customer. Cloudflare didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>   \"Over the past four years we have been banned from multiple cloud hosting providers and were told that if we didn't like it we should 'build our own.' So, that's exactly what we did,\" Gab CEO Andrew Torba said in a blog post last September. The process took a year, he said. </p><p>   Following in Gab's footsteps represents a more technically complex alternative than finding another cloud vendor but one that could make sense for Parler, said Fredrick Brennan, the founder and former administrator of 8chan, which several service providers have dropped over its links to mass shootings. Mr. Brennan has since stopped working for 8chan and is now a vocal critic of the website, now rebranded as 8kun. </p><p>   \"If I was them, I would figure out where Gab was hosted,\" he said of Parler. </p><p>   Mr. Torba declined to say where Gab now houses its servers or how much its data-center migration cost. \"I'm far too smart to answer those questions,\" he said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Jeff Horwitz contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
