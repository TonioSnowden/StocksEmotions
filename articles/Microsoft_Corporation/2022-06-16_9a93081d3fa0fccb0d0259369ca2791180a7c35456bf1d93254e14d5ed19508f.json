  "title": "Bid to Quell Inflation Buoys Stocks --- Dow, S&P jump after central-bank chairman signals increase was 'unusually large one'",
  "text": "<p>Early Thursday, Asian markets moved higher with Japan's Nikkei 225 up 1.4% and mainland China's CSI 300 up 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Dow futures each rose 0.5%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.6%.</p><p>The Fed's move is its latest effort to quell inflation through tighter monetary policy. Investors had largely expected the central bank to raise its short-term benchmark interest rate by 0.75 percentage point.</p><p>What some investors had worried about heading into Wednesday's interest-rate decision was that the Fed would have to raise interest rates at an even more aggressive pace.</p><p>At a news conference that followed the decision, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday's move was \"an unusually large one.\"</p><p>Mr. Powell added that he expected either a 0.50 percentage-point or 0.75 percentage-point increase at the Fed's July meeting.</p><p>Ultimately, the guidance the Fed gave about the direction of interest rates on Wednesday is more important for markets than the size of the rate increase, said Dorian Carrell, a fund manager at Schroders.</p><p>Uncertainty about monetary policy has been a key driver of volatility this year, helping send the S&amp;P 500 on Monday into bear-market territory, or a drop of at least 20% from a previous high. Fund managers said they see hawkish central banks being the top tail risk that could potentially upset markets, Bank of America found in a June survey.</p><p>\"Markets are pricing in a Fed that's trying to get in front of the curve rather than behind the curve on inflation,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. That helped lift stocks heading into Wednesday's rate decision, Mr. Hogan added.</p><p>Stocks rose broadly, with 10 of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors ending higher.</p><p>Technology shares, which have been among the hardest-hit areas of the stock market this year, were among the biggest gainers on Wednesday. Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon.com and Netflix each added about 3% or more.</p><p>Economically sensitive areas of the market also rose. Bank stocks, which had sold off on investors' fears about a slowdown in economic growth, climbed Wednesday, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index up 1.6%.</p><p>Energy stocks slid, marking a relatively rare retreat for the year's best-performing S&amp;P 500 sector. The S&amp;P 500 energy sector declined about 2.1%. The group has surged this year thanks to rising oil prices lifting energy companies' profits to records.</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. government bonds rallied after sliding in recent weeks in a selloff that pushed yields to their highest levels in more than a decade. The yield on 10-year Treasurys slipped to 3.389% from 3.482% Tuesday. Yields, which fall as bond prices rise, help set rates for everything from mortgages to federal student loans.</p><p>Elsewhere, European stocks and prices on peripheral government bonds in the eurozone jumped after the European Central Bank held an ad hoc meeting on Wednesday to discuss turbulence in the region's bond markets.</p><p>The ECB outlined a plan to buy more bonds of weaker eurozone governments under an existing bond-purchase program. It tasked ECB staff with accelerating the design of a new instrument that would narrow differences in borrowing costs across the region, addressing financial imbalances that have long posed a problem to the currency union.</p><p>\"They wanted to make sure financing conditions don't deteriorate too much,\" said Willem Sels, chief investment officer at HSBC Private Banking and Wealth Management. Mr. Sels said the meeting signaled that the ECB was ready to cushion markets earlier than investors had expected.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.4%, led by banks and insurers. Shares of Italian banks, which own a substantial chunk of government bonds, had suffered as the debt fell in price.</p>",
