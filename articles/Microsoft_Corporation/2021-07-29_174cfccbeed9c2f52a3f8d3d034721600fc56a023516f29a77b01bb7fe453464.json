  "title": "Why a book-lover like me turned from a Finisher to an Abandoner",
  "text": "<p>There are broadly two kinds of readers — Finishers and Abandoners — and they are completely baffled by each other's reading habits. I used to be a Finisher. If I started a book, I had to read to the last page, including the index and the bibliography, or the sky would fall and human civilisation as we know it would come to a halt.</p> <p>Some years ago, when I read an interview with Bill Gates in which he stated, “It's my rule to get to the end”, I felt a glow of warm satisfaction. I had not founded Microsoft; I was not a billionaire philanthropist; but Gates and I had this one thing in common: we both finished books.</p> <p>I ploughed joylessly through the 1,150-plus pages of <em>The End</em>, the sixth volume of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39a27dce-a6e7-11e8-926a-7342fe5e173f\">Karl Ove Knausgaard</a>'s autobiographical series, despite the sense of being confined in broken elevator with a superbly incisive but repetitive intellect. I finally finished JD Salinger's novella <em>Seymour: an Introduction</em> (which took four run-ups) with none of the pleasure that <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> gave me. </p> <p>I have no idea why I didn't question the daftness of this Finisher's approach. But then came the pandemic, when human civilisation as we knew it really did come to a halt, and it stopped me in my tracks.</p> <p>Not only did this modern-day plague underline the fact that life was short, sometimes fleeting, it also made me keenly aware of the value of pleasure. Like many of my friends (we have traded furtive confessions through these last 18 months), I found myself struggling to concentrate, as though some essential widget in my reader's brain had broken. One day, I paused in the middle of another virtuously literary novel and thought, “That's it. I do not love this book.” I set it down and reached for a racy Swedish crime thriller without a shred of self-judgment. </p> <p>In the blink of an eye I had become an Abandoner, one of those marvellous readers who can get about 40 pages into a book and then, by some astonishing act of will, simply <em>stop</em> reading it and choose another.</p> <p>“Of all the questions an aspiring writer might ask herself,” posits George Saunders in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6bf9b2c-1c5a-4717-83e1-4baf2b93da3e\"><em>A Swim in a Pond in The Rain</em></a>, his collection of essays on what you can learn from four Russian authors about writing and reading, “here's the most urgent: What makes a reader keep reading?”</p> <p>As a former Finisher, my answer would have been embarrassingly solemn: you keep reading out of respect for the labour of the writer, out of a sense of fidelity to the broader church of literature itself. And so on. But the truth was more ignoble. I finished books partly out of hope, partly because I liked the image of myself as a dedicated reader, slogging up the most daunting of mountains.</p> <p>Hope is easily explained. I wrestled with Roberto Bolaño, not really getting into <em>The Savage Detectives</em> until I'd read 100 pages — but I was so glad I stayed, because once I began to understand what he was doing, I was there for the full, exhilarating ride.</p> <p>Being a Finisher also helps when you're reading out of your comfort zone; it gets you through the feeling of swimming in strange waters. I didn't want to be an Abandoner in part because the laziest of that breed miss out on some of the most rewarding reading.</p> <p>Online reading communities from Goodreads to Reddit often feature lists that might be categorised as “I Just Couldn't Get Into It”. These include acclaimed authors, from Stephen King to JK Rowling or Elizabeth Gilbert, from George Orwell (<em>1984</em> often pops up on lists of books that readers have started but never finished) to Erin Morgenstern or Arundhati Roy.</p> <p>Amazon, too, is littered with reviews that say “cannot get into this authors' writing” for Toni Morrison, or complain that “the tempo is SO slow” with regard to Hilary Mantel's outstanding <em>Wolf Hall</em> trilogy. In many of these cases, it's the reader who's missing out — shoals of other readers will still love those books.</p> <p>In her reading memoir <em>So Many Books, So Little Time</em>, Sara Nelson offers a tip for how to avoid the twin traps of finishing books you don't really care for and abandoning books that might have brought you joy. Her books are sorted into “piles near my bed, the ones mentally marked Must Read, Might Read, and Maybe Someday”. That pre-sorting requires some thought, humility and self-knowledge, but it's useful for both Finishers and Abandoners to pause and reflect before they start reading.</p> <p>I am still a Finisher of sorts — books on my Must Read pile, from translations to poetry to sweeping histories, will never be abandoned. But I'm easier on myself with the Maybe Someday pile; it's fine, even liberating, if that becomes Maybe Never. As a former Finisher, I revel in the virtue of ticking a book off that task list, but unleashing the hidden Abandoner side of me has loosened me up — and made reading, once again, a joy.</p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p> <p><strong>Letters in response to this column:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d359c81-9fd8-42b7-9e21-437b8331e9cb\"><em>Joyce's most difficult novel is better on audiobook</em></a><em> / </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d359c81-9fd8-42b7-9e21-437b8331e9cb\"><em>From Zarir F Udwadia, Mumbai, India</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73e16b90-c916-4fc9-a1d2-0f3cada576bc\"><em>An Elizabethan essayist shaped my reading habits</em></a><em> / </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73e16b90-c916-4fc9-a1d2-0f3cada576bc\"><em>From Khalid Ikram, Potomac, MD, US</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b9a9789-08b6-49e3-bd6b-a00a67e38291\"><em>Apply ‘the mathematics of love' algo to books</em></a><em> / </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b9a9789-08b6-49e3-bd6b-a00a67e38291\"><em>From Frank E Bannister, Dublin, Ireland</em></a></p><p>Source: Nilanjana Roy 2021 'Why a book-lover like me turned from a Finisher to an Abandoner' FT.com 29 July.
