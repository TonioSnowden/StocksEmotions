  "text": "<p>With the Masters teeing off in the eye of this hurricane, the question is whether it can again count on its rich golf history, iconic setting and famous azaleas to keep attention on the golf tournament when controversy calls. That's the strategy Augusta has used repeatedly to navigate when critics have questioned the club's practices and demographic makeup.</p><p>So far, Augusta National, its high-profile members, the tournament's biggest corporate sponsors and even broadcasters have handled the situation and its convergence with the Masters with the same sound heard when golfers stand over a putt: silence.</p><p>\"It's a widely televised event and people are watching,\" said James Woodall, president of the Georgia NAACP. \"The expectation is that anytime there is injustice happening, we want everybody to speak out.\"</p><p>A spokeswoman for Augusta National Golf Club deferred comment to the club's chairman, Fred Ridley. He hasn't spoken publicly on the matter, but has a scheduled news conference Wednesday.</p><p>Leading Masters sponsors including International Business Machines Corp. and Rolex also declined to comment on their relationship with the tournament; Mercedes-Benz and AT&amp;T Inc. didn't respond to inquiries.</p><p>Prominent Augusta members including Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett, philanthropist and co-founder of Microsoft Bill Gates and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice didn't respond to inquiries about their plans, or whether they had communicated with the club over the issue. An MLB spokesman declined to answer whether commissioner Rob Manfred, who is a member, would attend.</p><p>Representatives for Augusta members Emerson Electric Co. chief executive David Farr, and former Democratic Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn declined to comment. \"Senator Nunn recommends that if you want to discuss anything related to Augusta or the tournament that you contact their chairman of the club,\" a spokeswoman said.</p><p>And IBM, whose former chief executive Ginni Rometty is also an Augusta member, said that \"we don't comment on the travel plans of our current or former executives.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Sabrina Siddiqui contributed to this article.</p><p>Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p><p>David Farr is a former chief executive of Emerson Electric Co. A Sports article on Wednesday about Augusta National Golf Club incorrectly said he is chief executive.</p><p>(WSJ April 8, 2021)</p>",
