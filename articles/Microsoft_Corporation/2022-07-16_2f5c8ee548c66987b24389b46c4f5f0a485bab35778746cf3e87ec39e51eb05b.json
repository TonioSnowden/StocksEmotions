  "text": "<p>   In the race for the Republican nomination to be Maryland's next governor, the biggest spender has been a Democratic group. </p><p>   The Democratic Governors Association has spent or has reservations in place to spend nearly $1.2 million on commercials labeling GOP candidate Dan Cox as too conservative, according to data from ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Political analysts say the commercials are likely helping Mr. Cox, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, to win the GOP nomination, but he would have a difficult time winning the general election in a state where President Biden defeated Mr. Trump 65% to 32% in 2020. </p><p>   Maryland is one of at least three states, along with Illinois and Pennsylvania, where Democrats have spent on ads boosting conservative candidates in GOP gubernatorial primaries. The Maryland race is a particularly potent target for the party, as outgoing Gov. Larry Hogan is one of the few Republican leaders of heavily Democratic states. </p><p>   Mr. Hogan, a moderate who has clashed with Mr. Trump and can't run for re-election because of term limits, has endorsed former state commerce secretary and longtime ally Kelly Schulz in the race. Polls show the two Republicans are running neck-and-neck in the primary election that will be held Tuesday. </p><p>   The Democratic race also appears close, with three candidates knotted at the front of a crowded field, based on voter surveys. </p><p>   The Democratic Governors Association, or DGA, began its campaign in Maryland on July 1, with an ad highlighting Mr. Cox's antiabortion and gun-rights stances, his false claim that the 2020 presidential election was fraudulent, and Mr. Trump's endorsement. At the end, it claims Mr. Cox is \"too close to Trump\" and \"too conservative for Maryland.\" </p><p>   The DGA has spent more than $821,000 through Wednesday on television and digital advertising, according to AdImpact, and has reservations in place for an additional $354,000 in spending through the primary. </p><p>   Ms. Schulz had spent about $750,000 on ads through Wednesday and had reservations for an additional $126,000, AdImpact data show. Mr. Cox had spent about $20,000 on cable and radio advertising, and nothing on broadcast television, with about $1,500 reserved for radio ads before the primary. </p><p>   The Schulz campaign filed a complaint with the Maryland State Board of Elections Monday, alleging the DGA violated state election law because it registered as opposing Mr. Cox \"when common sense and all available facts prove otherwise.\" </p><p>   In an interview, Ms. Schulz said: \"Every Republican in the state, every Republican across the nation, should agree that the Democrats should not be meddling in our primaries. We should agree that we should not be treated like idiots, and we're not going to be swayed by the Democrats trying to fix an election.\" </p><p>   State election officials said the matter was under review. The DGA called the complaint \"bogus.\" </p><p>   \"Given Cox's front-runner status and radical MAGA stances, we are starting the general election early and wasting no time to hold him accountable,\" DGA spokesman Sam Newton said. </p><p>   Mr. Cox's campaign didn't respond to requests to comment. </p><p>   Mileah Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes Center for Politics at Goucher College, said the DGA ad benefits Mr. Cox by publicizing his positions, which many Republican voters are likely to embrace. \"They're doing some of the lifting that Cox's own campaign organization can't afford to do,\" she said. </p><p>   In Maryland, only registered Republicans and Democrats may vote in their respective party's primary. </p><p>   A recent Goucher poll found Mr. Cox with support from 25% of Republican voters compared with 22% for Ms. Schulz. The poll, released June 28, had a 4.8% margin of error, meaning the two are in statistical dead heat; 44% of GOP voters were still undecided. </p><p>   Dr. Kromer said that Ms. Schulz potentially could replicate Mr. Hogan's coalition in the general election -- Republicans, independents and about a quarter of Democrats -- but that Mr. Cox lacks a path to the governor's mansion. </p><p>   \"There is no evidence that suggests they would get behind somebody who is endorsed by Trump,\" she said of Maryland voters. </p><p>   Mr. Cox, an attorney who serves in the Maryland House of Delegates, said recently on Steve Bannon's \"War Room\" podcast that he is confident he could win the general election. </p><p>   In a July 1 public statement, he said: \"Marylanders want a conservative Republican to slash taxes and stop inflation, end the blood running in our streets with high crime and drug deaths, and stop the anti-American and gender indoctrination of our kids in school and teach kids excellent academics and the Bill of Rights again.\" </p><p>   Ms. Schulz has called for cutting taxes, allowing students in failing schools to attend a different campus, and increasing support for police, along with stepped-up efforts to keep violent repeat offenders in prison. While she is antiabortion, she said Maryland voters in 1992 approved the right to abortion and that \"under my leadership nothing will change.\" </p><p>   On the Democratic side, polls show a three-way race between former U.S. labor secretary and onetime Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez, state Comptroller Peter Franchot and Wes Moore, an author who was chief executive of Robin Hood, an antipoverty foundation. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   John McCormick contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
