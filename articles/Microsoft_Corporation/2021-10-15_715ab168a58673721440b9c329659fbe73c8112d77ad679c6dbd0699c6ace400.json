  "text": "<p><em>How well did you keep up with the news this week? Take our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2021-10-15/\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>. </em></p> <p>A panel of top US scientists advising the Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94c3ee7e-98a1-49c5-9fc7-4daedac311d7\">has recommended</a> approving Moderna's application to provide third shots of its Covid-19 vaccine, lending some momentum to the US's booster rollout.</p> <p>The 19 members of the panel all voted in favour of allowing Moderna to supply third doses of its vaccine to people who had their second doses at least six months ago and are over 65, have underlying health conditions, or whose jobs put them at high risk of contracting severe Covid-19.</p> <p>But members of the committee made clear they are so far unpersuaded by the case to offer boosters to all adults.</p> <p>Last month the FDA approved a third shot of the BioNTech/Pfizer&#xa0;Covid-19 vaccine&#xa0;for vulnerable Americans but stopped short of approving the shot for all of the adult population as well, a decision that was a severe setback to the Biden administration's plans for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37fdfcbf-27cb-42cd-a037-bf3952969c8c\">a widespread booster campaign</a>. </p> <p>Stanley Perlman, professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, said: “I support this [application] because we've already approved it for Pfizer and I don't see how we can possibly not approve it for Moderna and not have most US folks be completely confused.”</p> <p>The FDA will make a final decision in the coming days on whether to give the go-ahead for Moderna booster.</p> <h1>Read more</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Why Pfizer has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee8714d1-7946-4c99-9ba5-106fb614bb85\">won the Covid vaccine race</a> but isn't getting credit. </p></li> </ul> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.</em> <em>Here is the rest of today's news — Gordon</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Citi and Morgan Stanley ride dealmaking wave</strong> The US banks benefited from a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe68be0f-6496-4437-b223-068dfc7179d3\">surge in dealmaking</a> that bolstered third-quarter revenues and offset pressure from low interest rates and weak loan demand.

The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5f7dd12-1812-44b8-b682-b4289bcdc7b8\">FT is reporting</a> several EU member countries are telling bureaucrats in Brussels to prepare for a trade war with the UK.</p> <p><strong>A marathon of marathons </strong>Runners in Paris, Lisbon and Toronto will take the starting line on Sunday. If you enjoy a gruelling run —<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acdd72fc-cab9-459e-ada6-77ab2df6c30a\"> like the FT's Laura Noonan</a> — there are more than 300 marathons to choose from in October, more than any other month this year, according to tracker Global Marathon.</p> <h1>What else we're reading </h1> <p><strong>‘There are choices to be made'</strong> After weeks of infighting, most Democrats in Washington acknowledge that Joe Biden's ambitious $3.5tn “Build Back Better”&#xa0;spending plan&#xa0;will have to shrink in order to get through Congress. Here are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87fe378a-87f3-4a15-89a2-e640d754b2ac\">some of the Democrats' options</a> for cutting the size of the package. </p> <p><strong>Where are the world's worst port delays?</strong> It is not only the US that is suffering shipping delays.

Tether represents about half the stablecoin universe, and it is often described as the reserve currency of the crypto world. But its reputation is not as stable as its name suggests.</p> <p><strong>Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala: adopting a global carbon price is essential </strong>A common approach to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0bcc93c-c6d6-475e-bf32-0d10f71ef393\">cost of polluting</a> is a fair and straightforward solution, writes the director-general of the World Trade Organization. Fragmentation risks generating trade frictions and unpredictability for businesses seeking to decarbonise.</p> <p><strong>Life, work and the pursuit of happiness </strong>As the coronavirus pandemic eases, people are fed up, burnt out and quitting their jobs. Freed from the daily grind, they are also seeking fulfilment in new careers. But there is a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ecb04dd0-4de7-44e0-8c16-973f5031e8d4\">dark side</a> beneath the data about “the Great Resignation”, writes Andrew Hill. </p> <h1>Food &amp; drink</h1> <p>Looking for something to cook this weekend?
