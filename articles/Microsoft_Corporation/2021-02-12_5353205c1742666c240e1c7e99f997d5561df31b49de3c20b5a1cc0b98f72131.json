  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>Cheap money sloshing around markets is inflating <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dbfc69df-7dbc-4338-a475-1432ffdc4056\">“stonk bubbles”</a>. Retail investors have been piling into US stocks (jokingly misspelled as “stonks”) such as GameStop. The fear of missing out is a powerful driver. But there is often a genuine trend behind hyped-up assets. We live in a time of enormous disruption due to technological innovation and climate change.</p> <p>Take cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin — up 1,200 per cent since mid-March 2020 — is often seen as the poster child of speculative excess. But should companies hedge themselves against the possibility that bitcoin succeeds? It surged to a record high this week after Elon Musk's Tesla revealed it had bought $1.5bn of it.</p> <p>Mastercard meanwhile expects to move cryptocurrencies across its card payments network. BNY Mellon plans to provide custody services for digital assets.</p> <p>Lex has a clear view on the utility of cryptocurrencies: at present this only extends to speculation and transactions made for ideological or illegal purposes. </p> <p>But we also think that financial businesses <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa644ba3-8409-4f61-a8d7-d0163d1cfd7f\">will deal in cryptos</a> if corporate and retail investors want them to, no matter how loudly some commentators rage against it. Corporate bitcoin purchasing remains a niche sport at present. Getting shareholder approval to speculate will be easiest for companies such as Google and Amazon, known for moonshot business ideas and strong cash flow.&#xa0;</p> <p>A few years ago, many mainstream investors considered talk of a rapid take-up of electric vehicles fanciful. But the pace of the transition is accelerating. Daimler's boss Ola Kallenius this week predicted that electric vehicle profits at standalone car business Mercedes-Benz would match those from combustion engines by 2030. That is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d1af90b-c039-42b0-9328-ea3000ba6ef1\">not an outlandish claim</a>, says Lex.</p> <p>General Motors has also put its pedal to the metal. Chief executive Mary Barra recently announced the US car company would have an all-electric fleet by 2035. The shares have tripled from lows last March. The company's market capitalisation has surged to almost $80bn. Investors are prepared to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bc6a04a-1409-412d-91f7-85b786ecc6d4\">overlook short-term problems</a>, such as a semiconductor shortage. They care less about 2021 than 2031.</p> <p>Energy giants such as Shell are having to make changes just as drastic. It outlined plans this week for getting to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. These include making renewable fuels and offering charging stations for electric cars. </p> <p>Shell is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78e20ca1-3f4b-4c1a-be2a-9b0b0a470904\">trying to be all things to all people</a>, says Lex. It wants to capture the benefit of rising oil prices while pivoting towards renewables. But the dividend, which was slashed last year, will take decades to return to 2019 levels. It may even get to zero net carbon emissions first.</p> <p>France's Total faces similar pressures. It plans a name change to TotalEnergies as it shifts to renewables. But its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6867b93c-04b0-4437-b780-a7a4e7ab26cc\">dividend yield</a> is expected to be more than 7 per cent, double that of Shell. That explains why its shares trade at a 10 per cent to 15 per cent premium to Shell, BP and Eni on an enterprise value to ebitda basis.</p> <p>The need to decarbonise is no longer a matter for debate. But the arguments over driverless cars are still raging. Sceptics can point to myriad deadlines missed. Regardless, investment is picking up. Microsoft recently joined a $2bn investment in GM's autonomous driving company Cruise, now valued at $30bn. Amazon has bought self-driving start-up Zoox.</p> <p>If such ventures succeed, Lyft could be offered a lifeline, says Lex. It is hard to be optimistic about its core ride-hailing business. But its consumer-facing app could be just the thing to turn driverless cars into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/401ebda7-e8f5-432b-b13e-dbc1ec6f5f43\">a viable commercial proposition</a>.</p> <p>Ecommerce is a proven concept and the pandemic has accelerated its uptake. This week, Ocado, the UK company that provides the technology for online grocery sales, reported a rise in revenues of more than a third. But even here, there is little firm ground. Its own estimate of its future fee opportunity — anything between £3.5bn and £26bn — shows why <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cec8c2ee-3301-4443-b567-4d5f1d2fd7fb\">investors' views diverge</a> about the investability of the shares, after more than doubling over the past year.</p> <p>With such big rises in technology share prices, SoftBank's thumpingly good third-quarter results this week came as no surprise. The tech-focused investment company's Vision Fund almost doubled gains in the past quarter. There are several reasons for caution, one of which is that the Vision Fund is less diversified than it looks. The crossholdings within it help turbocharge returns when markets are on a roll. But if the holdings network goes wrong, it could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a4d0c05-99cb-44f8-aca4-076d8c4349a1\">unspool quickly</a>.</p> <p>Another lockdown phenomenon has been the soaring popularity of pets. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc27a2fa-861e-4560-bc70-67c71f7232cc\">Prices have risen steeply</a>, most notably for Cocker Spaniels. In Britain, their cost more than tripled between the third quarter of 2019 and 2020.</p> <p>But not all dog owners will have time to look after them once workplaces reopen. The worry is that many pandemic-era puppies will eventually end up in animal shelters. Bubble trouble is not just a financial phenomenon.&#xa0;</p> <p>Enjoy the weekend,</p> <p><strong>Vanessa Houlder<br></strong><em>Lex writer</em></p> <h2>Best of Lex articles</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa644ba3-8409-4f61-a8d7-d0163d1cfd7f\">Tesla/bitcoin: asset exchange</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d1af90b-c039-42b0-9328-ea3000ba6ef1\">Daimler: Electric Circus</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bc6a04a-1409-412d-91f7-85b786ecc6d4\">General Motors: semi-charmed life</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78e20ca1-3f4b-4c1a-be2a-9b0b0a470904\">Royal Dutch Shell: all things to all people</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6867b93c-04b0-4437-b780-a7a4e7ab26cc\">Total: brand on the run</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/401ebda7-e8f5-432b-b13e-dbc1ec6f5f43\">Lyft/driverless cars: along for the ride</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cec8c2ee-3301-4443-b567-4d5f1d2fd7fb\">Ocado: packer cracker</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a4d0c05-99cb-44f8-aca4-076d8c4349a1\">SoftBank: eggs in baskets</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc27a2fa-861e-4560-bc70-67c71f7232cc\">Dog prices: pedigree chums</a><br></p><p>Source: Vanessa Houlder 2021 'Best of Lex: kicking up a stonk' FT.com 12 February.
