  "text": "<p>Back in the age of enforced walking, when the only way to see anyone was to do circles around the local park, I went on a walk with a friend I hadn't seen for a while. As we trudged, I started saying something about having reinvented myself — but she cut me off.</p> <p>How can you <em>reinvent</em> yourself, she asked, when you didn't invent yourself in the first place?</p> <p>This was just the sort of clever-dick thing I might have said myself, pre-reinvention, when I was still a sarky newspaper columnist.</p> <p>But now, here I was, living proof that at the end of your sixth decade it was perfectly possible to change your life entirely — to move house, split with your husband, stop dyeing your hair and quit being a journalist to become a teacher. As a result of having done all that, I told my friend, I seemed to have become a slightly different person.</p> <p>You can't change who you are, she said. And in any case, she went on, the big decision to change my career was less momentous than I made out as all I was really doing was returning to the family fold. My mum was a teacher and my dad an academic, so if I became one too, that was about as remarkable as when my old classmate at school, Emma Thompson, the daughter of two actors, opted to join them on the stage.</p> <p>This was a downer. If she was right it not only meant my supposed reinvention was a sham but cast doubt on all the millions of other people who, fed up with having spent the past 15 months staring at a green dot at the top of their computer screens, have either reinvented themselves — or are considering it. A record 4m Americans left their jobs in April and, if a survey by Microsoft is to believed, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work\">40 per cent</a> of all workers everywhere are considering throwing in the towel and doing something else.</p>  <p><strong>As we started our second lap</strong>, I gave my friend chapter and verse on exactly how my new life had made me different — and mainly nicer. In my old one I was paid to interview famous people and developed a technique that involved handing my subjects a noose and waiting for them to put their heads into it — which they nearly always did, if I waited long enough. I was mean about almost everyone — and even managed to be faintly disobliging about the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p> <p>Every week I would write columns in which I picked on hitherto obscure corporate managers who had sent emails containing naff phrases such as “global talent experience” or “accelerate our ambition” and proceed to tear them limb from limb. At the time it seemed funny but, now I think of it, it wasn't very nice.</p> <p>By contrast, these days I <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13231302-8443-4652-b751-4082a936b282\">spend my time</a> trying to get the youth of east London to see the difference between the level of unemployment and the rate of unemployment. This is not at all funny, and often requires patient, repeated applications to have any effect at all, but nevertheless seems a worthwhile thing to be doing. It stands to reason that this radical shift in what I do, why I do it, and who I do it with must have left some mark on my character.</p> <p>I can also make a strong case for having acquired some humility as a result of having been taken down a peg or 10. As a journalist I was good at what I did (even though I didn't always feel it at the time) but for the first two years as a teacher I was shockingly poor. Several times a day, I endured the humiliation of failing publicly in front of 30 hostile teenagers. I used to stand there, sweating heavily and trying to look dignified while a 13-year-old girl called out: “Miss, I could learn this better from watching a video.”</p> <p>Even now, I have to listen politely as colleagues 35 years my junior tell me off for failing to have taken a register or input data correctly. If that doesn't make one humbler, I said, I don't know what does.</p> <p>Hmm, she replied. You seem much the same to me.</p> <p>As soon as I got home I fired off an email to the people who knew me best. I chose 12 friends and family members who between them had nearly 500 years experience of me and put the question to them. Had I changed? Was I any nicer? More humble?</p> <p>My younger daughter was first to reply. Is this humble? she asked.</p> <p>One after another, the rest returned my completed questionnaire. Not a single person could detect any sign of increasing niceness or of humility.</p> <p>“You weren't exactly nice to start off with and I wouldn't say you were nice now,” one of my closest friends emailed back.</p> <p>The only change some of them remarked on was that I was becoming more priggish — not remotely sympathetic when I heard the daughter of so-and-so didn't get into Oxford and instead pointed out that compared to the lives of the kids I taught, this daughter was very lucky indeed.</p> <p>Given the score was now 12 to 1, I had little choice but to accept the verdict and admit my friends and family have a sounder grasp of me than I have of myself. Psychological studies bear this out, as does my experience from decades as an interviewer — we are all unreliable witnesses when it comes to ourselves.</p> <p>I remember interviewing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a563a5a-6cde-11e5-8171-ba1968cf791a\">Jonathan Franzen</a> to discover that the man who is so smart about the foibles of people in his novels is so clueless about his own. He told me he found one percenters sickening — but when I pointed out that he was one himself, he corrected me: “I am a poor person who has money.” It seems I'm just like Franzen — only he's a better writer.</p> <p>I now see that by focusing on goody-goody things like niceness and humility I was looking for the wrong thing. I didn't change career to become a better person, exactly. I changed career because I was not only fed up with my job but fed up with myself.</p> <p>The test of success of my “reinvention” is whether changing career has made me less so. The good news is that it has — and then some. This is because, for the first time in my life, my work has given me a complete break from myself. I am so busy setting detentions and marking exam scripts that there is no time for even the briefest contemplation of my navel.</p> <p>Last week I sent out another questionnaire to several hundred ageing professionals who have retrained as teachers through <a href=\"https://nowteach.org.uk/\">Now Teach</a>, the charity I co-founded, asking how “reinvention” had been for them. I wanted to know how they felt. Unchanged? More fulfilled? Less tired of themselves? Nicer, even?</p> <p>Admittedly, the survey was biased as it only went to those who have stuck with teaching and not to the 15 per cent who found it so awful/stressful/difficult/knackering they ended up quitting. But even so, the results were pleasing. Of the 85 per cent who are still at it, four-fifths said they felt different as a result.</p> <p>Prolonged exposure to the lives of children, many of whom are poor or otherwise disadvantaged, turns out to have a marked effect on former bankers (or journalists, come to that): they variously felt more compassionate, more patient, warmer and much less enamoured by riches — in other words, they felt nicer.</p> <p>Quite possibly their friends and family would disagree, but even so there may be something else at work here — the cause and effect may run the other way. One teacher said he had not become nicer since switching careers; he had become a teacher because he had got nicer already.</p> <p>This would make him the same as all older people everywhere. Psychological studies from all over the world show that everyone gets more altruistic with age. It's called the “maturity principle”: the average 65-year-old is more generous, more agreeable and less neurotic than the average 20-year-old. (This might even explain why my friends can't see any improvement in me — because they are benefiting from the maturity principle too.)</p> <p>In my survey, I did not presume to ask the new teachers if they were happier. I don't like being asked this myself as I never know how to answer it. Happiness is so fragile that talking about it tends to destroy it. But many volunteered an answer anyway. Teaching, they said, despite all its privations, was making them more content.</p> <p>“I'm more exhausted,” said one. “I no longer have time to go to the gym. And I'm making more inroads into my wine collection than before. But, overall, I'm definitely happier.”</p> <p>Though I agreed with almost everything they said (especially with the man who said he'd turned into an officious stickler for rules as a result of the sheer quantity of reprimands he issued daily) there was one thing that struck a particular chord. “I've become more authentic,” said one Now Teacher. “I've moved closer to the essence of me,” said another, while a third wrote: “I'm more in tune with myself.”</p>  <p><strong>Once upon a time I would</strong> have thought this insufferable twaddle. I've written whole columns about the flatulence people emit on the subject of authenticity. But, this time, I know exactly what they mean and couldn't agree more.</p> <p>Every day as I walk into school, even when it is pouring with rain and I'm badly prepared for a double period first thing with my least favourite class, it feels the right thing to be doing. Not right in a moral way, just the right thing for me. There are other things in my life that feel right in much the same way. Gardening. Having grey hair. Always having dirt under my fingernails. Being wildly enthusiastic. Buying things in auction sales. Eating McVitie's chocolate digestives last thing at night.</p> <p>These things have a common denominator: my mother.</p> <p>For the first three decades of my working life I tried to be as unlike my bookish leftwing parents as possible, starting off in an investment bank and embracing the values of the free market. Four years ago, when mum had been dead for a decade and dad a fortnight, I did a sudden and unplanned about-turn and proceeded to gallop back towards the beliefs I was born with. There is a study showing the average age women start to ape their mothers is in their mid-30s, which means I was a quarter of a century late but, boy, am I making up for lost time.</p> <p>I break off writing to answer the door to the postman who is bearing my latest eBay package — some vintage William Morris linen Chrysanthemum fabric of a sort that mum introduced me to when I was 13.</p> <p>It turns out my friend was right on all counts. There is very little agency in my story of reinvention — but I'm not sure how much this matters. I no longer care if I am a better person: it occurs to me that, deep down, mum may not have been much nicer than I am. My sole guide on how to live and how to be happy now is to try to be like the wirily enthusiastic, white-haired teacher my mum was. And the beauty of this ambition is that, having taken the plunge and become a teacher, I need do no more conscious reinventing. All the rest is happening anyway, all of its own accord.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/lucy-kellaway\"><em>Lucy Kellaway</em></a><em> is an FT contributing editor and co-founder of </em><a href=\"https://nowteach.org.uk/\"><em>Now Teach</em></a><em>, an organisation that helps experienced professionals retrain as teachers.
