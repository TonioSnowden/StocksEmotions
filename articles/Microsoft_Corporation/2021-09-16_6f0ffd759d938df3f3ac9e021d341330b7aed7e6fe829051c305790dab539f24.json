  "text": "<p>Kati Vilkki (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1bfba547-dd9d-4aca-b2d5-cc3b7d550520\">Letters</a>, September 15) seeks to establish a distinction between leadership and management, the former defined as “anything that propels us towards a collective goal”. A more precise definition, and one that covers both management and leadership, is that it consists of organising and motivating people in pursuit of a common goal.</p> <p>To support a distinction which doesn't exist, she resorts to disdaining managers by saying their time is often spent running “arcane organisational processes” of little value. </p> <p>This claim ignores two organisational truths. First such processes are mostly mandated by bosses, otherwise known as leaders, and second, most leaders are appointed after working their way up the management tree. </p> <p>She then makes the bizarre claim that you can appoint managers but not leaders. No doubt the latter descend somehow from corporate heaven. </p> <p>My view is leadership has become a fetish, as browsing LinkedIn will confirm. Its advice on how to tap your inner greatness or fulfil your vision is as abundant as it is fatuous. </p> <p>Managers need to focus on developing professional competence and skills and then, one day, a few of them will become leaders. And as leaders whenever they feel a vision coming on they should remember the words of the late Helmut Schmidt, former German chancellor: people who have visions should see a doctor. </p> <p><strong>David Hall</strong> <br><em>Hong Kong</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Recalling Schmidt's quip about leaders with vision' FT.com 16 September.
