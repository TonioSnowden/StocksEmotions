  "text": "<p>Salesforce made the appointment a day after Mr. Taylor was named Twitter Inc. chairman, which came with the departure of the social-media's company's CEO, Jack Dorsey.</p><p>Salesforce on Tuesday also reported a 27% increase in third-quarter sales to $6.86 billion and net income of $468 million. But the company's revenue forecast for the current quarter and for the following quarter came shy of Wall Street expectations.</p><p>Shares in the software company closed down nearly 4% at $284.96 and fell more than 5% in after-hours trading following the results.</p><p>The twin-CEO structure has had a mixed record at the small number of companies that have tried it over the years. Salesforce rivals Oracle Corp. and SAP SE adopted it in recent years, but both have since abandoned the structure.</p><p>Mr. Benioff, on an analyst call, said: \"These jobs are big jobs, and being able to have a partner that you can share with makes it a lot easier.\"</p><p>Salesforce was a pioneer in offering cloud-based software that has seen accelerated adoption during the pandemic, as businesses embraced such tools to function better with remote staff.</p><p>The company that made its name by providing cloud-based software has expanded its offering, including through a series of acquisitions.</p><p>The company earlier this year closed its $27.7 billion acquisition of Slack Technologies Inc., the company that runs a workplace collaboration application. In its first full quarter as part of Salesforce, Slack outperformed the company's expectations, Mr. Taylor said.</p><p>A new feature called Slack Connect that the company introduced to broaden the appeal of its software by allowing intercompany messages between customers saw 176% growth year-over-year, he said.</p><p>The deal came after Salesforce acquired Tableau Software Inc., a data analytics platform, for $15.7 billion in 2019.</p><p>The Slack acquisition intensifies Salesforce's push to provide a broader set of business software and adds to the company's rivalry with Microsoft Corp., which offers its own workplace collaboration tool, Teams, launched in 2016.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
