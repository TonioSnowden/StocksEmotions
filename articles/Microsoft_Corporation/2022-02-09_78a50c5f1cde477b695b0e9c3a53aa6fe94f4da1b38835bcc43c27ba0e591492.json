  "text": "<p>\"We are more focused on adapting to regulation than fighting against it,\" said company President Brad Smith. He and Chief Executive Satya Nadella met with reporters Wednesday ahead of meetings with lawmakers and others about the Activision deal.</p><p>The principles would also help Microsoft offer its new gaming store on devices where it can't today, executives told reporters Wednesday. Apple's iPhone, for example, doesn't allow competing app stores, a step the company says helps it to protect users' security and privacy.</p><p>In January, Microsoft announced its largest-ever acquisition of $75 billion for Activision. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, would help bolster the company's subscription gaming service, called Game Pass. The service offers users a catalog of games to play for a monthly fee. With Activision, Microsoft would get access to hugely popular franchises such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What does Activision mean for Microsoft? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission will be reviewing the deal. Since assuming office last summer, FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan has sought to increase scrutiny of acquisitions. The agency will be looking at whether the Activision deal could lessen competition in the gaming market, The Wall Street Journal has reported.</p><p>The deal fits in with Microsoft's move to buy up more studios that fit into Game Pass. Since Mr. Nadella took over as CEO in 2014, Microsoft has spent more than $10 billion to buy more than a dozen game studios, including last year with its acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc., owner of the Doom and Elder Scroll franchises, for $7.5 billion.</p><p>Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com and Aaron Tilley at aaron.tilley@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft Promises Openness on New App Store as It Seeks Approval for Activision Deal</p>",
