The placemat-size painting of three women from 1888 hints at his larger, earlier scene of the same trio that belongs to Philadelphia's Barnes Foundation. It was only estimated to sell for $100 million, but four bidders pushed it higher. The winning telephone bid was fielded by Christie's specialist Xin Li-Cohen, who often represents bidders from mainland China and the U.S. The Seurat was one of five works that topped $100 million. These included a $137.8 million mountain-top vista by Cezanne,  \"La Montagne Sainte-Victoire.\" </p><p>\n  -- Kelly Crow </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  GEORGIA </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Gingrich Must Testify </p><p>\n  In Probe, Judge Says </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich must comply with a subpoena seeking his testimony in front of a special grand jury in Georgia investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to influence that state's 2020 election results, a Virginia judge ruled Wednesday. </p><p>\n  Mr. Gingrich, who lives in northern Virginia, had argued that the federal law that normally requires states to honor out-of-state grand jury summonses shouldn't apply in this case because the special grand jury lacks the power to indict. He also argued that the subpoena would be unnecessarily duplicative and burdensome because he has already agreed to testify in front of a congressional select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. </p><p>\n  Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Robert Smith said the subpoena should be enforced. The judge said the law doesn't parse out a difference between regular grand juries and special grand juries. </p><p>\n  -- Associated Press </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  BOSTON </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Coach Is Sentenced </p><p>\n  in Admissions Case </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Former Yale University soccer coach Rudolph Meredith was sentenced in a Boston federal court to five months in prison for his involvement in the sprawling college-admissions cheating scandal that also ensnared executives and Hollywood stars, a harsher sentence than even the prosecutors had recommended. </p><p>\n  Mr. Meredith took $860,000 in bribes from corrupt college counselor William \"Rick\" Singer and agreed to a $450,000 payment directly from at least one parent. Mr. Meredith's attorneys couldn't be reached for comment. </p><p>\n  -- Melissa Korn </p><p></p>",
