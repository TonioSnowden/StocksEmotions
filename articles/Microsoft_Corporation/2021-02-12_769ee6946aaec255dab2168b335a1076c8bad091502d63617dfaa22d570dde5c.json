  "text": "<p>   Can the world's jet fuel ever be green? </p><p>   Under pressure to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, airlines are experimenting with so-called sustainable aviation fuels, or SAF. The most advanced contender is biofuel, mainly made from cooking oil, animal fats, agricultural crops and unused wood, though it is a struggle to use on more than a small fraction of flights because of the lack of supply and the high costs. In the coming decade, different types of alternative fuels could make flying even cleaner. </p><p>   SAF are imitations of kerosene, the refined petroleum that has burned in jet engines for decades. Different types of SAF exist, but only biofuel is in use today. </p><p>   From 2016 to 2020, roughly 300,000 out of around 188 million total flights world-wide used SAF, according to the International Air Transport Association. </p><p>   Still, they are key to cutting aviation's environmental footprint, industry experts say. Aviation has driven 3.5% of the world's human-made greenhouse gas emissions, according to a 2020 study by Manchester Metropolitan University. </p><p>   United Airlines, which is aiming to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, started using biofuel regularly in 2016. It used only 4 million gallons in the past five years, compared with 4 billion gallons of conventional fuel in an average year, says Lauren Riley, managing director of global environmental affairs and sustainability. </p><p>   Biofuels cost up to four times more than conventional jet fuel, says Ms. Riley. </p><p>   It is not feasible to replace all kerosene jet fuel with biofuel because of the limited supply of biomass, says Andrew Murphy, aviation manager at the nonprofit Transport &amp; Environment. </p><p>   Still, there is momentum for biofuel to help make aviation cleaner. Microsoft Corp. signed a deal late last year with Alaska Airlines and SkyNRG, a Netherlands-based maker of biofuel, to use it on some of its frequent business-travel routes. </p><p>   Airlines say a solution to the pricing problem is government support, which looks more likely under a Biden administration. The European Union is considering quotas for airlines to use SAF. </p><p>   Another promising technology on the horizon is e-fuels. Also known as power-to-liquid fuels, they use renewable energy such as solar and wind to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is then combined with carbon monoxide created from captured carbon dioxide. This fuel is seen as more promising because, in theory, it would offer an unlimited supply. It will likely still need years before it comes on the market. </p><p>   \"Scaling used cooking oil or scaling vegetable oils won't be sustainable in the long run,\" says Annette Mann, head of corporate responsibility at Deutsche Lufthansa AG. \"We really need the power-to-liquid technology which is now under development and still needs a lot of investment.\" </p><p>   In early 2019, Lufthansa signed a letter of intent with Heide, a refinery near Hamburg, Germany, to make and purchase power-to-liquid jet fuel. </p><p>   Anna Mascolo, president of global aviation at Shell, predicts costs for e-fuels to fall much like wind and solar as production scaled up. </p><p>   Massive government aid through taxes, incentives and subsidies is needed, aviation experts say. These new fuels compete with much cheaper fossil fuels that have enjoyed $4.4 trillion in government subsidies over the past decade, according to the International Energy Agency. </p><p>   Replacing all jet fuel with SAF is unlikely even by 2050, though halving the use of kerosene would bring airlines substantially closer to the goals outlined in the Paris climate agreement. </p><p></p>",
