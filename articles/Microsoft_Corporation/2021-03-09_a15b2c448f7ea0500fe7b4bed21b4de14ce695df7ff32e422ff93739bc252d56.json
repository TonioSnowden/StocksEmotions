  "title": "Business News:  Startup IonQ Plans  Its Public Debut  In $2 Billion SPAC  ----  By Sara Castellanos",
  "text": "<p>\n  Quantum-computing startup IonQ Inc. plans to merge with blank-check firm dMY Technology Group Inc. III, which would make it the first publicly traded company focused on commercializing quantum-computing hardware and software. </p><p>\n  College Park, Md.-based IonQ on Monday said it intends to file paperwork in about a week with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public on the New York Stock Exchange through a special-purpose acquisition company deal valuing the combined entity at about $2 billion. The deal will need approval from the SEC and SPAC shareholders. </p><p>\n  \"It is kind of a groundbreaking moment in history,\" said Peter Chapman, chief executive of IonQ and formerly director of engineering for Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Prime business. </p><p>\n  IonQ is competing against several companies, such as International Business Machines Corp., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and D-Wave Systems Inc., trying to commercialize quantum computing using various technological approaches. No scalable, commercial-grade quantum computer has been built yet. </p><p>\n  \"The race for quantum computing is real,\" said Matthew Brisse, research vice president at tech research firm Gartner Inc. \"We're seeing quantum [computing] come out of the labs and get into the digital economy.\" </p><p>\n  By 2023, 20% of global organizations, including governments and companies, are expected to budget for quantum-computing projects, up from less than 1% in 2018, according to Gartner. </p><p>\n  If the deal goes through, IonQ will have raised $734 million in funding since its founding in 2015, including $300 million through its planned merger with dMY Technology III and another $350 million in private investment funding from Hyundai Motor Co.; Breakthrough Energy Ventures, an investment organization led by Bill Gates and focused on climate change; and others. The company also has raised $84 million in venture-capital funding. </p><p>\n  Quantum computers aim to harness the power of quantum physics to sort through a vast number of possibilities within a fraction of a second to come up with a probable solution. </p><p>\n  The money raised from the transaction will be used to help IonQ manufacture a quantum-computing machine that works at room temperature and is about the size of an Xbox videogame console, Mr. Chapman said. That would be significantly smaller than early-stage machines on the market today, without requiring the supercooling necessary to achieve quantum mechanical effects. IonQ expects the device to be completed in 2023. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  The Combination Is </p><p>\n  Called a No-Brainer </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  IonQ's technological approach involves commercializing university lab research on trapped ions, which naturally exhibit the quantum mechanical effects needed for the machines to work, Peter Chapman, chief executive of IonQ, said. </p><p>\n  The company has given about 20 million software developers access to its current early-stage quantum-computing device through partnerships with cloud-computing service providers Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. It expects to generate more than $1 million in revenue this year, Mr. Chapman said. </p><p>\n  Blank-check company dMY was established last year and is co-headed by Niccolo de Masi, formerly chief executive of videogame company Glu Mobile Inc., which is being acquired by Electronic Arts Inc. </p><p>\n  He called it a no-brainer to work with IonQ, in part because of the talent the company has been able to attract. </p><p>\n  IonQ, which has about 60 employees, recently hired Dave Bacon as vice president of software. He formerly led Google's quantum-computing software team. </p><p></p>",
