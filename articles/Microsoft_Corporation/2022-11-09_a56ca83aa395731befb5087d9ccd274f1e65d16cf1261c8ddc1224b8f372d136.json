  "text": "<p>   MR. BIER: The H-1B visa benefits the U.S. economy in numerous ways, creating innovation and new products that benefit U.S. consumers, reducing costs and inflation, and expanding the tax base. The H-1B visa is also the only way for most skilled workers to obtain permanent residence in the United States. As a result of these pathways, foreign workers have risen to become CEOs of dozens of major companies, including Microsoft and Google. Skilled immigrants (mostly starting their careers on H-1B visas) have also gone on to found more than half of the $1 billion startups in the U.S., creating thousands of jobs for U.S. workers. </p><p>   MS. BROWN: I think it's better than nothing but a far cry from what would really help the U.S. economy. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Ziegler is a former Wall Street Journal reporter and editor.
