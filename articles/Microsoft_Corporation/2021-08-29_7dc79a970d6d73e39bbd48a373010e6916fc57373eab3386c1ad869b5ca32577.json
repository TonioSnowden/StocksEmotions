  "title": "How the Census Misleads on Race; A new 'diversity index' and a subtle change in a question have resulted in an undercount of whites.",
  "text": "<p>\"Races\" are defined not by biology but by cultural convention. As late as the early 20th century, many Anglo-Americans didn't identify Southern or Eastern Europeans as \"white.\" In 1918, 33-year-old Harry S. Truman, while visiting New York City, wrote his cousin: \"This town has 8,000,000 people. 7,500,000 of 'em are of Israelish extraction. (400,000 wops and the rest are white people.)\" After World War II, Jews and Italians became identified as \"white.\"</p><p>Something similar seems to be happening to many Americans of Hispanic and Asian origin. About 3 in 10 Hispanics and Asians intermarry, usually to a white spouse. According to a 2016 study by economists Brian Duncan and Stephen J. Trejo, 35% of third-generation Hispanics of mixed parentage no longer identify as Hispanic; and 55% of third-generation Asian-Americans of mixed parentage no longer identify as Asian. A 2017 Pew report found that among Americans of Hispanic origin who don't identify themselves as Hispanic, 59% said that they were seen by others as white.</p><p>The racial identity of Hispanics is especially confusing because the census asks about \"Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin\" separately from race. In the 2010 census, 53% of those who said they were of Hispanic origin checked off only \"white,\" a 58% increase in numbers from 2000. That rise in white Hispanics helped account for the increase in the number of whites from the prior census. But in the 2020 census, a mere 20.3% of Hispanics checked off only \"white,\" contributing to the 8.6% decline in the total number of people identifying only as white.</p><p>That dramatic change probably stemmed not from a shift in social consciousness or demographics, but from a subtle change in the 2020 question about race. In 2010 the census asked respondents to check off whether they were white, black or African-American, American Indian or Alaska Native, various varieties of Asian or Pacific Islander, and \"some other race.\" They may check off as many race boxes as are applicable.</p><p>But in 2020 the census asked respondents who checked off \"white\" to specify their nationality: \"Print, for example, German, Irish, Italian, Lebanese, Egyptian, etc.\" No Spanish-speaking nationality was listed. That likely created the impression that Hispanic was another race, notwithstanding the previous question's disclaimer that \"Hispanic origins are not races.\"</p><p>Thus, many Hispanics who would have checked off white alone in 2010 may have checked \"white\" and \"some other race\" in 2020. The number of Hispanics checking two or more boxes increased by 567% from 2010 and make up about two-thirds of those who checked both boxes. Seventy-one percent of the population checked white in 2020, either alone or with one or more other boxesâ€”an increase of 1.9% from 2010. It is very possible that if the census hadn't changed the race question in 2020, the number of \"whites\" might not have declined at all or declined only slightly. The number certainly wouldn't have fallen 8.6%.</p><p>Over time, social mobility and intermarriage will likely further weaken the distinction between Americans identified as white and those with Asian and Hispanic ancestry. As sociologist Richard Alba has argued, census projections that the U.S. will become a \"majority minority\" nation by 2045 are likely to prove false.</p><p>To confuse matters more, the census introduced in 2020 a \"diversity index\" that filtered out Hispanics who considered themselves \"white\" by creating a quasiracial category of 57.8% \"non-Hispanic whites.\" This was the percentage most commentators reported as \"whites.\" It eliminated the 20.3% of people of Hispanic origin who still checked off only \"white.\" The authors of the census appear determined to fuel nativist fears that whites are being \"replaced\" and liberal hopes of a growing minority-based Democratic majority.</p><p>As for politics, Democrats may become the majority party, but not through demographics alone. Like earlier first- and second-generation Americans, many Hispanics and Asians initially found a home in the Democratic Party, but later (like the Irish or Poles) have begun making their political choices based on class, interest and values. If later-generation Hispanics and Asian-Americans still vote Democratic, it probably won't be out of ethnic identification. There was some evidence of that in the 2016 and 2020 elections, in rising support among these groups for Donald Trump and other Republicans.</p><p>By contrast, many African-Americans, whose ancestors were forcibly brought here, haven't followed the path of European immigrants. Black Americans are less likely to intermarry than Asians or Hispanics, and when they do, their children are likely to identify as African-American. According to a 2015 Pew survey, mixed-race African-Americans are more likely than other groups to complain of racial discrimination.</p><p>More telling, in a 2018 study, Mr. Alba and sociologists Brenden Beck and Duygu Basaran Sahin found that while Asians and Hispanics who intermarry are likely to enjoy a significantly higher standard of living than unmixed Hispanic and Asian couples, African-Americans who marry whites have a standard of living only very slightly higher than unmixed African-American couples. \"The distinctiveness of black ancestry among mixed whites reveal the continuing power of anti-black racism in the United States,\" Mr. Alba writes.</p><p>That sorry fact is obscured by the census's diversity indexes and by the use of terms like \"people of color\" or \"nonwhite,\" which suggest a commonality between African-Americans living in poverty in Chicago's South Side and the Indian-American CEOs of Microsoft and Alphabet. The census may help with reapportionment and redistricting, but it doesn't paint an accurate picture of America and its politics.</p><p>Mr. Judis is author of \"The Politics of Our Time: Populism, Nationalism, Socialism.\"</p><p>How the Census Misleads on Race</p>",
