  "title": "World News: Ukraine Leans on Musk's Starlink for Communications",
  "text": "<p>Ukrainian officials and officers at headquarters and in the field credit Starlink with keeping their forces connected.</p><p>\"Without Starlink, we would have been losing the war already,\" said one platoon commander on the Izyum front, where Russian forces are trying to push south to capture the Donbas region.</p><p>Mr. Musk's move comes with reputational risks if the service doesn't live up to his billing. His intervention in the war on the side of Ukraine also risks drawing Moscow's ire and alienating governments friendly or fearful of Russia. Those could include markets where Starlink, owned by Mr. Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, might one day hope to compete.</p><p>The company isn't the only Western business that has offered support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion: Microsoft Corp., for instance, said it has helped Kyiv ward off cyberattacks.</p><p>Starlink's deployment in Ukraine has drawn particular praise from Ukrainian leaders. Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov said in an interview that Starlink had been critical for communications between commanders and units in places where regular cellphone service is out. Mr. Reznikov said he recently sent a personal letter to Mr. Musk to thank him and explain that the country needs more Starlink gear.</p><p>\"Starlink is a very, very good piece of equipment,\" Mr. Reznikov said. \"It's not lethal, but it's really effective.\"</p><p>Unlike a fiber-optic connection, Starlink's portable satellite dishes communicate with a constellation of satellites that beam down the internet. The dish then sends out a Wi-Fi signal for nearby devices.</p><p>Like most satellite-internet systems, Starlink can't match the bandwidth of more traditional fiber-optic and cellular networks. It doesn't rely on cellphone towers or buried fiber lines, though, making it more robust in conflict zones. The service's compact and easy-to-move satellite dishes are also proving well-suited for the backup internet needs of a crisis-hit country such as Ukraine.</p><p>SpaceX didn't respond to requests for comment. The Kremlin didn't respond to a request for comment. In May, Dmitry Rogozin, who at the time led Russia's space agency Roscosmos, said Mr. Musk would be \"held responsible, like an adult\" for enabling Ukraine's military communications.</p><p>Starlink, which SpaceX has been developing over the past few years, is trying to build a large business selling high-speed internet connections powered by its growing fleet of low-orbit satellites. Mr. Musk has also said the revenue Starlink generates could fund SpaceX's broader ambitions, such as developing more advanced rockets and spacecraft.</p><p>The internet service had around 400,000 subscribers, according to a recent regulatory filing in the U.S. Several years ago, SpaceX envisioned having more than 40 million subscribers by 2025, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported.</p><p>In May, Starlink was available in 32 countries, SpaceX said on Twitter. The company said Thursday that regulators in Georgia authorized Starlink for use in the country.</p><p>Starlink's approach is similar to those of Britain's OneWeb and Amazon.com Inc., which plans to roll out its low-orbit satellite network over the next few years. The SpaceX business also competes with more established companies offering internet service using satellites stationed deeper into space such as Viasat Inc.</p><p>Before the war, SpaceX had been pushing to win regulatory approval in Ukraine, company executives have said. On Feb. 26, two days after Russia invaded, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, tweeted at Mr. Musk, requesting Starlink terminals.</p><p>\"Starlink service is now active in Ukraine. More terminals en route,\" Mr. Musk responded a few hours later. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell told a conference in March the exchange provided a regulatory green light: \"They tweeted at my boss, and that was our permission.\"</p><p>Apart from its role bolstering Ukraine's command and control on the battlefield, Starlink has helped officials quickly reconnect liberated towns to the internet. Coverage has allowed soldiers to stay in touch with loved ones. Thousands of troops cut off at a steel mill in the southeastern city of Mariupol used Starlink to send and publish online photos and videos chronicling their plight along with public and private messages to the outside world. They surrendered in May.</p><p>---</p><p>Vivian Salama contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
