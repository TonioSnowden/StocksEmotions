In testimony due to be delivered to the Senate banking committee later today, she implored lawmakers to raise the debt limit in order to avert what she said would be a “catastrophic event for [the] economy”.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>In other Fed news: </strong>Two senior officials, whose&#xa0;trading activity&#xa0;prompted the US central bank to launch an ethics review, said yesterday they were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b899a77f-9853-4d20-ad84-21848b7e7ce2\">resigning</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Do you think the debt ceiling will be breached?
