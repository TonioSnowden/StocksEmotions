The Federal Reserve, for example, said on Monday it would close most of its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a159a3d8-ae45-483c-84b8-e60d5121af89\">pandemic relief</a> programmes in a sign of its growing confidence.</p> <p>Biden's proposals have, however, increased expectations of a return to the inflationary levels of 30 years ago, as evidenced in the prolonged sell-off in bond markets. New data today, however, showed only a slight uptick in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7dc398a0-4575-4353-8152-8c9048ad5a33#post-f80fc4e6-76ae-458e-adf9-2f4aafd1ae68\">consumer price index</a> in February to 1.7 per cent from 1.4 per cent, in line with forecasts, albeit the biggest rise in six months. The data softened global concerns about inflation after <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3124771/china-factory-gate-prices-jump-february-producers-pass-rise\">China</a> earlier on Wednesday reported factory gate prices increased from 0.3 per cent to 1.7 per cent, the highest level since November 2018.</p> <p>The Biden plan is also of great significance to the wider world economy: the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f7d4b7d-028a-41a6-b11e-8320173ae4bc\">OECD</a> on Monday said it could add 1 per cent to global growth this year. The Paris-based organisation also upgraded its December forecast for US domestic growth of 3.2 per cent to 6.5 per cent. </p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p>The <strong>European Central Bank</strong> meets on Thursday with bond purchases and the outlook for growth and inflation likely to dominate. Here are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/499c092f-088b-4f59-81b6-caef19f9eb72\">five things to watch</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc825399-345c-47b8-82e7-6473a1c9a861\">pandemic</a> is being blamed for <strong>falling birth rates</strong> across Europe. Said a demographer: “Uncertainties are one of the leading reasons why people don't have children. And people are still confronting significant health, and in particular economic, uncertainties.”</p> <p>The <strong>British Business Bank</strong> said 43 per cent of small and medium-sized UK businesses sought <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed97b82e-db74-47d5-b527-126df6fc6c23\">external financing</a> last year compared with just 13 per cent in 2019, highlighting the struggle to cope with the pandemic. A third of SMEs said they expected to shrink over the next 12 months: many will find it difficult to repay their debts.</p> <p>Our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/feb3029b-7baf-427a-840b-01c30c0c78d2\">Trade Secrets</a> newsletter examines whether the recent surge in global <strong>freight costs</strong> will be passed on to consumers and feed an increase in inflation. The consensus seems to be that this will not be a lasting phenomenon: multiyear contracts are offering much better rates than one-year ones, suggesting prices could soon fall. </p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>Watch this: Our new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/e6f487f4-a7d9-4e90-b9cb-ef8d25803bec\">short film</a> on vaccine economics features Bill Gates, the heads of Moderna and Gavi, and the lead scientist behind the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab on the <strong>vaccines market</strong> and how business models have been transformed by the pandemic as mass investment from governments de-risks the hitherto costly R&amp;D process. Tensions between the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d28903d-3723-45cc-878a-21e1f2d39493\">UK and the EU</a> over supplies are also back in the news.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/e6f487f4-a7d9-4e90-b9cb-ef8d25803bec.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Profits at <strong>Inditex</strong>, the world's biggest retailer, plunged more than two-thirds to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/912b75ba-f025-4b20-820e-7c994bff8ff0\">€1.1bn</a> as shoppers turned from fashion — the company's main focus — to more casual lockdownwear. In London, <strong>Marks and Spencer's</strong> flagship Marble Arch store faces <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51550de4-5d02-4446-b5d4-1044fd2f9364\">demolition</a> as business moves online. But when it comes to food shopping, physical stores still matter, says chief business commentator <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce6aa47e-9096-4952-933b-08385609a581\">Brooke Masters</a>: “Apps cannot replicate a physical visitor's ability to scan a shelf, make substitutions and, crucially, discover things they didn't know they wanted.” </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7dc398a0-4575-4353-8152-8c9048ad5a33#post-167366c4-b44f-4dc4-842e-3629a5299238\">Cathay Pacific</a> reported a loss of $2.8bn in the latest sign of pandemic damage to the <strong>airline industry</strong>. The company's outlook looks bleak, says our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9df53f1b-6d08-48a0-af54-233ba0bc8bf1\">Lex column</a>. The UK is considering cutting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70bbc71d-50f5-49fd-97d3-36625146e7d9\">air passenger duty</a> on domestic flights. The reduction in the levy — which raised £3.7bn in 2019 — is opposed by environmentalists. </p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p>An investment frenzy has driven the value of domestic <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4d0516e-cddc-44e7-8ea6-ea66c7e78b15\">mergers and acquisitions</a> in <strong>China</strong> this year to $77.5bn — the busiest-ever start to a year and three times higher than last year. Demand is being driven by a “perfect storm” of economic recovery and Beijing's policy of reducing reliance on overseas markets.</p> <p>JPMorgan strategist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1e55398-2cbc-4172-86e3-bc53047f192d\">Thushka Maharaj</a> argues in the FT that the recent market sell-off is a sign that the era of <strong>government bonds</strong> as safe harbour investments is coming to an end. “Given the risks on the horizon, investors have no choice but to diversify sources of safety in portfolios,” she concluded.</p> <p>Criticism is mounting over the permanent closure of the 140-year-old system of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a21bd2d3-850c-4e33-9e55-0b9c88940c99\">open-outcry trading</a> at the <strong>London Metal Exchange</strong>, which has been shut for a year because of the Covid-19 crisis. With possibly unintended irony, one executive said the debate about the switch to electronic trading involved “lots of pointing and screaming without a lot of constructive dialogue”.</p> <h2>Have your say</h2> <p>Reader cakehoover comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5d01f06-9f7c-4cdc-9fee-225e15b5750b?commentID=3c1aad5e-7d5b-415c-94c2-daa733e4caf0\">Mothers step back at work to cope with pandemic parenting:</a></p> <blockquote>  <p>“Couples need to discuss labour allocation within the household explicitly . . . The trick has been to use a management system with clear lines of responsibility and ownership — so if one person doesn't do the work it's obvious, and there aren't incentives to ignore it. <br>My husband is on board with this: it probably helps that we earn the same amount, and that he is a decent human being. But I know other relationships where this seems true, and yet the woman picks up 90 per cent of all the household labour. And this seems to be trebly true of childcare. Why? Do couples not discuss labour allocation? We need to develop management systems for sharing labour effectively within households — and not be hostile or resistant to talking about it.”</p> </blockquote> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p>More evidence is emerging of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2dffc06a-0211-4878-9138-0518efbdf7c2\">power of music</a> to calm the soul — and even reduce pain — in an age of isolation and anxiety, writes David Cheal from our arts team. Even listening to heavy metal can ease stress. Best avoid the techno though . . . </p> <p><em>We would really like to hear from you.
