  "text": "<p>Blue Prism has agreed a £1.1bn takeover by private equity group Vista Equity Partners, ending a turbulent five years as a public company for the two-decade-old British software group. </p> <p>Following the acquisition, Vista intends to integrate Blue Prism with Tibco, the Silicon Valley-based data analytics company it took private for $4.3bn in 2014. </p> <p>Alongside the Blue Prism deal, Texas-based Vista said it “intends to explore the potential sale of all or a portion of its equity interest” in the enlarged Tibco, which “may happen within the next 12 months”. </p> <p>As it prepares for a sale, Vista said it was considering “potentially material headcount reductions” of 8 to 10 per cent of the approximately 4,750 employees of the merged companies. Blue Prism has about 1,000 staff worldwide. </p> <p>Vista will pay 1,125p a share in cash for the Warrington-based provider of process automation technology, whose customers include Fidelity, Daimler, eBay and the NHS. </p> <p>The price is a 35 per cent premium to Blue Prism's closing price before sale talks were first disclosed a month ago but less than half its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2b69813-7731-3994-9133-bb4419d4457a\">all-time high</a> in September 2018 of 2,575p, when it was valued at almost £2bn. <a href=\"https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/market-news/offer-for-blue-prism-group-plc/15151094\">Blue Prism said</a> the deal promised “certain value” to shareholders at a time of “strategic and operational headwinds” and “execution risks”. </p> <p>It is the latest overseas takeover of a London-quoted tech company this year, after cyber security company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb9ab52f-aede-4d32-a474-dad87b3d80d5\">Avast</a> agreed an $8bn deal with NortonLifeLock. Games developers have also been targets: Tencent is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0484f00c-fede-4b15-9108-9437b6c776b4\">buying Sumo Group</a> for £919m and Codemasters was bought by Electronic Arts for $1.2bn. </p> <p>“Vista and Tibco recognise the strength of what we have built and the exceptional products and services we provide our customers,” said Jason Kingdon, Blue Prism's chair and chief executive. </p> <p>Founded in 2001, Blue Prism began trading on Aim at a £48.5m market capitalisation in March 2016, after posting annual revenues for 2015 of £6m. The stock has see-sawed in the intervening years, as initial hype around the potential to automate routine back-office tasks with software “robots” gave way to execution challenges and slowing growth. </p> <p>Even as its sales have grown to a projected £160m this year, Blue Prism has experienced continuing losses, shareholder protests over its leadership and strengthening competition from UiPath, which is valued at $28bn following its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in April, as well as business software giants Microsoft, Salesforce and SAP. </p> <p>In April 2020, Blue Prism's co-founder Alastair Bathgate stepped down after 18 years as chief executive. At the same time the company raised £100m to help it through the pandemic's sales challenges. </p> <p>He was replaced by then-chair Kingdon but at its annual shareholder meeting in March this year, only 65 per cent of investors voted in favour of his re-election as chief executive. That prompted Blue Prism's board to begin consulting with shareholders about a potential sale, the company said on Tuesday, pointing to the need for “considerable continued investment” in product development and sales to keep pace with rivals. </p> <p>Alongside the deal, the company will also appoint a new chief executive. </p> <p>Blue Prism had said late last year that it was exploring a secondary listing in the US, after persistent grumbling that British investors undervalued growing tech companies. But the stock took its biggest hit to date in January, falling by a quarter in a single day as it warned that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/033716fd-56d7-4fe2-a839-6a86689ddc70\">revenue would fall short</a> of market expectations for the year to October 2021 and restating revenues for 2019. </p><p>Source: Tim Bradshaw in London 2021 'Blue Prism agrees £1.1bn takeover by Vista' FT.com 28 September.
