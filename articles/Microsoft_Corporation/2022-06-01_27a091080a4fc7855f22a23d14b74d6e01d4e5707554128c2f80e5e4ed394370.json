It comes a day after the EU agreed a partial ban on Russian oil imports. Here's an explainer on how that ban will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e62a1ef1-22d9-4591-bda4-0a0d5e5f6c15\">affect global markets</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Citigroup</strong>, the US lender with the largest business in Russia, may <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2d9c16c-5e3d-41d3-aea1-002e06f8cfe1\">retain a banking licence and some operations</a> in the country, chief executive Jane Fraser said yesterday. </p></li>  <li><p>In <strong>Russia</strong>, shuttered shops and disrupted supply chains illustrate how western sanctions are beginning <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7df9b453-509b-41c4-8957-ac170aca61aa\">to filter into the economy</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Thanks for reading and here is the rest of the day's news — Gordon</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.

The bank in April raised interest rates by half a percentage point, the first time in more than two decades it tightened monetary policy with an increase of that magnitude.</p> <p><strong>Economic data </strong>Job openings are expected to have dipped to 11.4mn in April, based on economists' prediction for the US Department of Labor's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (Jolts) report.

As the developed world demands emissions cuts, African leaders are asking whether poor countries can achieve high living standards <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/1e8c12fe-4823-41a1-8069-b6150876427d\">without intensive use of fossil fuels</a>.</p> <p><strong>NSO's cash dilemma </strong>Faced with a cash crunch so severe that the Israeli manufacturer of cyberweapon Pegasus could miss its payroll, Shalev Hulio had a startling suggestion.
