  "text": "<p>It would be comic if it were not so plainly tragic. The fate of those pleading to be airlifted from Kabul last August depended in part on Microsoft Outlook “flags” — coloured markers used to organise emails.</p> <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/865f490b-e5ef-41a8-8852-1550ef038fd7\">Raphael Marshall</a>, a 25-year old UK Foreign Office whistleblower, emails from desperate applicants for evacuation were marked blue for eligible and red for ineligible, before details were entered in a spreadsheet. Earlier emails, read but not processed, carried a black flag. Other messages for help went unflagged altogether. <em>The Office</em>, meet the Great Game. </p> <p>File the episode under B for the banality of tragedy. At its peak, the Foreign Office tried to field 19,000 emails in a day, out of 250,000 that came in during the crisis. Poor inbox hygiene contributed directly to the failure to evacuate the right people from Afghanistan. </p> <p>Marshall's <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/41257/pdf/\">account</a> is a litany of wider dysfunction that would be familiar to office drones everywhere. Crisis preparation was lacking. Lessons had not been learnt from a previous email overload in 2020, when Covid hit. Departmental systems had not been integrated, so officials could not adequately support colleagues. Soldiers assigned to help were not familiar with the Microsoft tools they were asked to use. Language skills and knowledge of Afghanistan were patchy. A three-shift system was short-staffed at critical moments and undermined by lack of communication with staff working from home and overemphasis on civil servants' “work-life balance” when actual lives were on the line.</p> <p>Criticism has rightly focused on inadequate leadership, from the then Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab (he has described the claims as a “mischaracterisation”), to the Foreign Office's top civil servant, Sir Philip Barton, who stayed on holiday as the crisis deepened.</p> <p>Some 15,000 people were plucked from the Kabul tarmac. Still, the debacle is a reminder how tiny management flaws can open into gaping chasms under pressure.</p> <p>Marshall's description of the Foreign Office in August suggests a classic case of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c005c34-ba66-4cec-9c0b-65488ce04b5a\">“priority overload”</a>, as described in an MIT Sloan Management Review <a href=\"https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/when-collaboration-fails-and-how-to-fix-it/?use_credit=4ddcf00ed6677a943d4daf558ad25091\">article</a> by Rob Cross and Inga Carboni, published last year: “A lack of co-ordination among disparate stakeholders; an inability to understand the workload of requests; . . . overwhelmed stakeholders who make ill-thought-out requests; [and] first-level leaders who agree to all requests, because being responsive has been critical to their success to date.”</p> <p>In their 2018 book on systems failure, <a href=\"https://www.meltdownbook.net/\"><em>Meltdown</em></a>, Chris Clearfield and András Tilcsik cite numerous parallels, albeit not on the same scale as the Afghan crisis. Retailer Target botched its expansion into Canada in 2013, by allowing little margin for error in a plan that combined a tight timetable with the establishment of a complex supply chain management system. Errors were duly made — the equivalent of misplacing Outlook flags. Staff entered bad data, which were amplified. Warehouses overflowed with excess inventory; store shelves lay empty.</p> <p>Similarly, Clearfield and Tilcsik point out that, following a series of fatalities, Everest climbing expeditions now obsess about getting logistical details right, to reduce complexity. In the past, apparently trivial issues such as stomach bugs and money disputes caused delays, “put stress on team leaders, took time away from planning, and prevented climbers from acclimating themselves to high altitude. And then, during the final push to the summit, these failures interacted with other problems”. </p> <p>Dennis Gioia was of similar age and experience to Marshall when he took charge of co-ordinating product recalls at Ford in 1973. In <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00870550\">a famous paper</a> describing how he failed to initiate an early recall of the dangerous Pinto model (prone to burst into flame in rear-end collisions), he describes “the overwhelming complexity and pace of the job of keeping track of so many active or potential recall campaigns”. Gioia blamed the mechanistic approach Ford used to process its mountain of incoming information, which muffled the appropriate ethical or emotional response to the Pinto crashes.</p> <p>The frustrated desire to do the right thing looms over the Foreign Office fiasco too. Understandably, many officials felt morally obliged to try to tackle the backlog, however hopeless the task. “Please save my children”, begged Afghans in the subject line of many emails. </p> <p>Marshall estimates only between 1 and 5 per cent of applicants could have been rescued, even if the system had operated perfectly. But that is not his main point: “I accept there were extremely hard decisions to be made; my concern is that these decisions were made badly.” </p> <p>It shames his superiors that basic management failings left him and his colleagues in such a position. </p> <p>andrew.hill@ft.com</p> <p>Twitter: @andrewtghill</p><p>Source: Andrew Hill 2021 'The mundane organisational flaws that can lead to tragedy' FT.com 13 December.
