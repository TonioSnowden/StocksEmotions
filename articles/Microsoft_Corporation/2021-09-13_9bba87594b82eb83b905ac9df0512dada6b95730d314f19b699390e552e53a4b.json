  "text": "<p>Democrats in the House of Representatives want to scale back Joe Biden's proposed tax increases on corporate income and capital gains, as part of $2.9tn in tax rises to pay for the US president's expansion of the social safety net.</p> <p>The draft tax plan, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/452fb8b3-fd2a-4403-8f2e-43f8895a9131\">obtained by the Financial Times</a>, was circulated on Sunday among members of the House ways and means committee and proposes the US corporate tax rate would rise from its current 21 per cent to 26.5 per cent — short of the&#xa0;28 per cent level proposed&#xa0;by Biden this year. </p> <p>House Democrats are also looking to raise the tax paid by investors on capital gains to 25 per cent from the current rate of 20 per cent — significantly below Biden's planned rate of 39.6 per cent.</p> <p>However, House Democrats also proposed a 3 per cent surtax on earnings of more than $5m a year, which would target the most affluent US households. Biden has not backed such a surtax.</p> <p><em>What do you think of the Democrats' plan to raise taxes to pay for the expansion of the social safety net? Email me gordon.smith@ft.com and let me know your views. Thanks to all the thoughtful responses to my question last week about Biden's plans to mandate workplace testing and vaccines.
