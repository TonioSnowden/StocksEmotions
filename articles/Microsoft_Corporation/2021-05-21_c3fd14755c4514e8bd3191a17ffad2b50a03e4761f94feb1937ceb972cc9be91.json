As it turned out, he barely survived spring.</p> <p>Black <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1390c33e-bae4-4a6d-9bcc-7af1ee5b09d5\">quit the board entirely</a> in March, citing “relentless public attention and media scrutiny . . . [that] have taken a toll on my health”. He is not accused of any wrongdoing, and has maintained that he knew nothing of the sex trafficking accusations facing Epstein.</p> <p>For a time, the stars seemed to be lining up for Harris, who appeared in glossy newspaper profiles, opened a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/josh-harris-apollo/\">LinkedIn account (soon to be updated)</a> and was considered the likeliest candidate to assume Apollo's highest office.</p> <p>But in a boardroom showdown in January, Harris was overlooked in favour of Rowan — a highly regarded yet reserved executive who had never seemed to show much interest in the day-to-day trials of running a massive asset management firm.</p> <p>In four short months, Rowan has reordered Apollo around the credit investing strategy he pioneered and merged the firm with Athene.</p> <p>Suddenly, Harris was considering his next act.&#xa0;</p> <p>Harris made a name for himself at Apollo's buyout franchise — a business that has rarely looked stronger. The firm's most recent flagship private equity fund, Fund IX, has achieved a gross IRR of 49 per cent, according to a letter sent to investors on Thursday and seen by DD. At the same time, Apollo's stock price hovers at all-time highs.</p> <p>Harris has plenty to keep him busy. The sports empire he shares with <strong>Blackstone</strong>‘s <strong>David Blitzer</strong> includes <strong>Crystal Palace</strong>, the English Premier League football club, and the NHL's <strong>New Jersey Devils</strong>. Their NBA team, the <strong>Philadelphia 76ers</strong>, is top seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs set to begin in days.</p> <p>If Harris feels wistful about leaving the firm where he spent three decades, a championship win this summer could yet supply the rebound he needs.</p> <h2>US regional bank M&amp;A, now or never?&#xa0;</h2> <p>More than a decade ago, soon after the financial crisis, every dealmaker in town (that's New York) predicted that there would be a wave of consolidation among the thousands of small US banks scattered around the country. It didn't happen.&#xa0;</p> <p>New crisis, new prediction: the US regional bank M&amp;A frenzy is coming. This time round it seems a little more real. Just last month there were 19 mergers in the sector, more than double during the whole second quarter of last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>It makes a ton of sense to expect a boom in M&amp;A activity. US interest rates are near zero, loan demand remains weak and growth prospects are still muted.</p> <p>“Banks are turning to mergers as an effective way to navigate the headwinds they are facing as an industry,” said <strong>Anu Aiyengar</strong>, co-head of global M&amp;A at <strong>JPMorgan</strong>, who has advised on six US bank deals over the past six months.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>But dealmaking for banks is tough. Why? Aiyengar said that “there needs to be a level of comfort with each other's credit books, related marks and the ability to accurately quantify and articulate synergies and dis-synergies”.</p> <p>Given all the headaches around bank mergers, what we should expect more of is small banks buying stakes in financial technology groups.</p> <p>“What the bank wants is the access to the service, as much as the investment return,” said <strong>Greg Lyons</strong>, co-chair of the financial institutions group at the law firm <strong>Debevoise &amp; Plimpton</strong>. Fintech companies can give them exactly that.&#xa0;</p> <p>Go deeper on this subject <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd64cac0-cc5a-4c8b-a3af-a79f8f831cde\">here</a>.&#xa0;And <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/subscribe?newsletterIds=575981ede74eb90300a44d8e\">sign up</a> to our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/fintechft\">#fintechFT newsletter</a>, delivered every Monday. </p> <h2>Silicon Valley veteran worried about Spacs</h2> <p><strong>Sandy Robertson</strong> isn't exactly the retiring type. Friday marks his 90th&#xa0;birthday but the pioneering Silicon Valley banker is keeping busy — as a director of <strong>Salesforce</strong>, a founding partner of the buyout firm <strong>Francisco Partners</strong> and a keen observer of the financial scene.</p> <p>His goal in life is to “stay active and stay curious”, Robertson <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36180ce3-1ae6-40a3-b3a3-9eb1b4312f3d\">said in a telephone interview</a> with the FT. “I have tried to stay interested in everything that happens in the world, and everything that happens in the world is reflected in the markets.”</p> <p>His enthusiasm for his life's work does not mean he is similarly excited about market valuations. While he does not detect the kind of mania that prompted him to warn about lofty internet prices in 1999 — only months before the bubble burst — he believes “we are in a very frothy period here, too”.</p> <p>“I told my younger partners, let's not confuse a bull market in technology with investment judgment,” he said. “The public market looks very frothy to me.”</p> <p>One warning sign for Robertson is the explosive growth in the number of&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c22bcb2-6184-4c3b-9284-bb152a578629\">Spacs</a>, or special purpose acquisition companies. “This Spac thing is very indicative of the later stages of a cycle,” he said. “There are some of them that are pretty good, but at the bottom there is a lot of junk.”</p> <p>Robertson is not opposed to Spacs on principle. The danger for him is that there are simply too many buyers circling a limited number of appropriate acquisition targets.</p> <p>“The seller has the advantage on price,” he said. “They [the Spacs] are going to pay too much. It's the proliferation of them that I'm worried about.”</p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> chief executive <strong>James Gorman</strong> has kicked off a succession battle with a string of leadership changes at the US investment bank, including promoting two top deputies, <strong>Ted Pick </strong>and <strong>Andy Saperstein</strong>, to be co-presidents.
