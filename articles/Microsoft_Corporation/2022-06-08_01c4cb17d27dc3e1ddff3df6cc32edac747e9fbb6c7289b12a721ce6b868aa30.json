  "title": "Jan. 6 Committee to Kick Off Televised Hearings Into Capitol Attack; House panel aims to sway public opinion by tying together disparate developments about Trump's role in the riot",
  "text": "<p>Republicans have called the investigation a politically motivated witch hunt designed to embarrass the party and Mr. Trump, who is considering another run for president in 2024. He has denied responsibility for the violence and continues to maintain the election was stolen.</p><p>The first hearing is Thursday at 8 p.m., followed by more hearings through late June. Led by Rep. Bennie Thompson (D., Miss.), the committee is expected to initially lay out the broad scope of its investigation, which has included interviews with more than 1,000 people and the review of tens of thousands of documents. It said it also plans to present previously unseen material, hear witness testimony and provide a summary of its findings.</p><p>The committee is expected to release a final report in September, and its members will have the option to refer Mr. Trump or others to the Justice Department for possible criminal charges. The committee is also set to release recommendations for actions Congress can take to further safeguard presidential elections, such as an overhaul of the Electoral Count Act, an 1887 law that governs how Congress handles presidential-election disputes, or changes to the Electoral College and the Insurrection Act.</p><p>With the hearings, committee members are aiming to tie together disparate developments and characters into a cohesive story line centered on Mr. Trump's actions, hoping they can grab viewers' attention like with Watergate in the 1970s and Iran-Contra in the 1980s. But the panel faces an uphill task, with public interest faded and impressions of the day hardened, more than a year after Mr. Trump was impeached by the House on the charge of inciting insurrection and then acquitted in the Senate.</p><p>The committee plans make the far-right group the Proud Boys a focus of the opening hearing. One witness is expected to be documentary filmmaker Nick Quested, who filmed the Proud Boys in the days leading up to the Jan. 6 attack. The committee is likely to feature previously unseen footage Mr. Quested's crew filmed of the Jan. 6 attack, according to Mr. Quested. The filmmaker was recording as a Proud Boy member pushed barricades on top of Capitol Police officers, he said.</p><p>Another witness Thursday will be Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards, the first law-enforcement officer injured by the pro-Trump mob, according to the committee.</p><p>This week, a grand jury indicted Enrique Tarrio, a former leader of the Proud Boys, and four other onetime members, with seditious conspiracy charges in connection with the Jan. 6 attack.</p><p>Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, lead prosecutor for last year's second impeachment trial of Mr. Trump and a member of the Jan. 6 committee, said Tuesday, \"the essence of the investigation is to get the truth to the people.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you expect the Jan. 6 hearings to play out? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Raskin said the hearings will \"blow the roof off the House,\" but others have signaled lower expectations.</p><p>Some members, including committee Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney (R., Wyo.), indicated the hearings will demonstrate that Mr. Trump and members of his campaign committed crimes as they sought to overturn the 2020 election. Ms. Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R., Ill.) are the only GOP lawmakers on the panel.</p><p>Allies of Mr. Trump this week have ramped up efforts to counter the hearing, with appearances on television and social media. On Thursday night, the group will coordinate a campaign-style rapid response, according to people involved in the process. Talking points circulated among surrogates argue the committee is politically motivated and represents a distraction from inflation, higher gas prices, the southern border and other issues.</p><p>\"The entire MAGA movement is united against this illegitimate committee and will work to ensure President Trump is defended against yet another Democrat circus trial,\" said Taylor Budowich, a spokesman for the former president, referring to Mr. Trump's Make America Great Again slogan.</p><p>Mr. Trump is involved in the planning, but aides declined to say what his role will be on the night of the hearing. If Republicans take back the House in the midterms, as is widely expected, party leaders have said they would end the Jan. 6 probe.</p><p>A majority of Americans say Mr. Trump was responsible to some degree for the attack, according to a recent poll by NBC News. Thirty-five percent said he wasn't responsible at all.</p><p>The hearings are expected to highlight various statements and tweets by Mr. Trump and link them to plans to interrupt Congress's counting of the Electoral College vote that day, according to people familiar with the committee's plans. They will also look at the pressure Mr. Trump applied to state and federal officials, including his own vice president, Mike Pence, to take steps that would reverse the election.</p><p>The committee is expected to home in on efforts to toss out pro-Biden electors of several battleground states and replace them with bogus electors for Mr. Trump, a plan pushed by attorney John Eastman and others. In a court filing related to Mr. Eastman's efforts to resist testifying, the committee argued that it has a \"good-faith basis\" to conclude that Mr. Trump and members of his campaign \"engaged in criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States.\"</p><p>The hearings are likely to lean heavily on video evidence, including previously unseen recordings of the Jan. 6 attack and recorded testimony of witnesses. Just last week, the committee interviewed former Trump Attorney General William Barr.</p><p>Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, and Donald Trump Jr., the former president's oldest son, have also been interviewed. Onetime Trump attorney and former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who led efforts to overturn the result of the election, appeared before the committee last month. Recorded testimony of Marc Short, chief counsel for Mr. Pence, is also likely to feature in the hearings. Mr. Short isn't currently expected to testify in person, according to people familiar with the matter, although the planning of the hearings remains flexible.</p><p>Testimony by junior White House staff members, such as chief of staff Mark Meadows's aide Cassidy Hutchinson, about what happened inside the Oval Office on Jan. 6, is also likely to be included in the hearings.</p><p>The hearings are likely to zero in on specific themes of the panel's nearly yearlong investigation, which was divided into several color-coded teams. The gold team focused on a pressure campaign by Mr. Trump and associates on federal, state and local officials to alter the results of the election. The purple team investigated extremist groups such as the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, several members of which have been indicted on conspiracy charges related to their actions on and before Jan. 6.</p><p>The committee's red team examined planners of the Stop the Steal rally and people involved with efforts to sow doubt about the results of the election. That group includes longtime Trump associate Roger Stone, former Trump aide Steve Bannon and former Trump national-security adviser Michael Flynn.</p><p>Different committee members will lead each hearing, interviewing witnesses and narrating video evidence. The final hearing on June 23, which will also be held in prime time, will be led by Mr. Kinzinger, whose criticism of Mr. Trump has made him an outcast in his own party, and Rep. Elaine Luria (D., Va.), according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Mr. Kinzinger and Ms. Luria will be tasked with making the closing arguments for the committee to the American public as the panel wraps up its two-week marathon of public hearings. One area they could focus on is what Mr. Trump was doing in the White House during the attack and whom he was talking to, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Daniella Cheslow contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Scott Patterson at scott.patterson@wsj.com</p><p>Jan. 6 Committee to Kick Off Televised Hearings Into Capitol Attack</p>",
