  "title": "GameStop Is Only for Fans; Videogame retailer's results and new CEO don't shed much light on its turnaround potential",
  "text": "<p>In other words, GameStop's corporate turnaround remains a work in progress, which is understandable: The company's latest batch of leaders has been on the job for only three months. It is also understandable for a company now dependent on game hardware and accessories for more than half its revenue. Next-generation PlayStation and Xbox consoles from Sony and Microsoft remain in short supply. Strong ongoing demand for those machines is good for GameStop, but it is also good for Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart and pretty much anyone else who gets their hands on a few units.</p><p>GameStop's share price slipped by as much as 10% Wednesday evening following the results and the company's brief conference, during which managementagain declined to take questions. Of course that is a pittance compared with its gain of 2,482% over the last 12 months. That run has allowed GameStop to raise more than $1 billion through stock sales, shoring up its balance sheet.</p><p>It also has washed out pretty much any critical voices. Short interest is now less than 10% of shares outstanding compared with the 20% that remained six months ago following January's infamous short squeeze. Only five brokers still cover the company compared with 11 two years ago, according to FactSet.</p><p>GameStop remains a stock for fans only. The company's moves to thin out its retail footprint and boost its online selling capabilities could bear some fruit, but a new fulfillment facility in Reno, Nev., isn't expected to come online until next year. Meanwhile, a growing percentage of games are sold as digital downloads each year. The chip shortage that has been hurting the production of new consoles and other accessories sold by GameStop is expected to last well into 2022. How GameStop's new leadership views these secular challenges remains a mystery; new Chief Executive Officer Matt Furlong didn't even mention the words \"videogame\" or \"console\" during his brief remarks on Wednesday's call.</p><p>Perhaps a good thingâ€”GameStop might no longer have extra lives.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>GameStop Is Only for Fans</p>",
