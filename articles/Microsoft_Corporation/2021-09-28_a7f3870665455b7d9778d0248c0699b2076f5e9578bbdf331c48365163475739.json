  "title": "Stocks Slump as Bond Yields Hit Three-Month High; Tech stocks pull S&P 500 lower, while bond yields rally on inflation concerns",
  "text": "<p>For much of the past decade, many investors had piled into shares of fast-growing technology companies, wagering they would deliver relatively robust profit growth even in a sluggish economic environment. This week, that trade hit a roadblock.</p><p>With the economy out of the worst of the pandemic-fueled crisis, the Federal Reserve signaled last week that it could start to reverse its pandemic stimulus programs as soon as November and raise interest rates sometime next year. That appears to have, in combination with other factors, prompted an unwind of some of the market's most enduring trades—pushing Treasury yields to their highest level in months and sending investors out of popular technology stocks.</p><p>Investors agree the economic outlook has improved significantly since 2020. But many, noting they credit much of the market's comeback over the past year and a half to extraordinary levels of monetary and fiscal support from Washington, wonder how well the market will be able to stand on its own once the Fed begins to taper its monthly asset purchases. Some investors have also expressed some worries about the economic outlook. Inflation has made a surprising comeback this year, something some worry will start to cut into companies' profit margins. The fast-spreading Delta variant of Covid-19 has also complicated economists' efforts to forecast the global economy's growth outlook.</p><p>\"People are realizing, or at least remembering, that central banks are going to have to start raising rates,\" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for State Street Global Advisors in Europe. \"The patient has become used to being given all these drugs, but soon those drugs are going to have to be reduced.\"</p><p>Tuesday's market selloff was broad, pulling all but one of the S&amp;P 500's sectors lower for the day.</p><p>Traders yanked money out of the technology sector. Shares of companies like Facebook, Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft, each of which had vastly outperformed the broader market this year, fell more than 2% apiece.</p><p>Meanwhile, selling pressure accelerated in the government bond market. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note looked poised to rise for a sixth consecutive day Tuesday, recently trading at 1.538%, compared with 1.482% Monday. Bond yields rise as prices fall.</p><p>Shares of energy companies bucked the trend, rising on the back of higher commodity prices.</p><p>Schlumberger added 4%, while Marathon Oil rose 2%. Crude oil prices have hit multiyear highs this week, while natural-gas prices jumped to their highest level since late 2008 earlier Tuesday. Strategists have attributed the spike to a combination of rising demand and supply shortages.</p><p>The jump in commodity prices has ramped up some investors' worries about short-term inflation pressures. Inflation tends to weigh on bond prices, since it erodes the purchasing value of their fixed payments.</p><p>Higher bond yields drew investors into the U.S. dollar, which was higher against every other major currency, from the euro to the Swiss franc. The ICE Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against a basket of others, rose for a third consecutive day. It was up 0.3% at 93.68, its highest level since November.</p><p>\"I'm struggling to see how we come out of this latest Treasury selloff without a spike higher by the dollar,\" said Kit Juckes, a currency strategist at Société Générale.</p><p>Overseas, European markets slumped, while Asian indexes were mixed.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 2%, led by losses among tech stocks.</p><p>Earlier, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 1.2% after signs of support from China's central bank helped boost beaten-down shares of Chinese real-estate developers. The People's Bank of China said late Monday it would \"maintain the healthy development of the property market and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of house buyers.\"</p><p>Shares of Country Garden Holdings, China Vanke and China Overseas Land and Investment all jumped between 5% and 6%. China Evergrande Group, the ailing real estate giant that has fallen behind on a payment to international bondholders, rose more than 4%.</p><p>Sunac China Holdings surged almost 15%, snapping two days of steep declines, after the property company played down a leaked plea for help from a local government, and said sales were good.</p><p>In Japan, the Nikkei 225 edged down 0.2%, while in mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.5%.</p><p>—Xie Yu and Frances Yoon contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com and Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Slump as Bond Yields Hit Three-Month High</p>",
