In May, Mr. Musk said his deal was \"on hold,\" as he questioned the way Twitter calculates spam and fake accounts. Mr. Musk has suggested that he thinks the number could be closer to 20%, without providing evidence that the company's disclosures were unreliable.</p><p>On Thursday, Twitter officials in a briefing doubled down on defending the accuracy of their calculation of spam on the platform.</p><p>Twitter is the latest tech company to announce layoffs amid falling stock prices and fears of recession. Last month, Coinbase Global Inc. said it would cut 1,100 employees, or 18% of its staff, while Unity Software Inc. last week announced that it would lay off 4% of its workforce.</p><p>Others, including Microsoft Corp., Snap Inc. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., have announced reductions in hiring or hiring freezes.</p><p>Numerous Twitter employees took to LinkedIn to post about the layoffs.</p><p>\"I am overwhelmed; nervous and anxious but trying to stay optimistic of the future,\" a recruiter who was laid off from Twitter wrote on LinkedIn on Thursday.</p><p>Write to Salvador Rodriguez at salvador.rodriguez@wsj.com</p><p>Twitter Lays Off Third of Talent Team</p>",
