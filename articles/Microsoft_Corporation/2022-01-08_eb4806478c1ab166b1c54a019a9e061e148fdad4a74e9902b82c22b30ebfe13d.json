  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Meta's Head of Communications Leaves  ----  By Meghan Bobrowsky",
  "text": "<p>   Meta Platforms Inc.'s head of communications said he is leaving the company in a Friday afternoon post to employees, creating a void at the top of the department managing the controversies surrounding the tech giant. </p><p>   John Pinette had overseen the company's external communications since 2019. Prior to joining what was then Facebook, Mr. Pinette handled business and philanthropic dealings for deceased Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen. He also ran communications for Alphabet Inc.'s Google in Asia and advised Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates in past jobs. </p><p>   \"Today will be my last day at Meta,\" Mr. Pinette wrote in the post. \"I know the team will continue to thrive as you do some of the most important -- and most difficult -- work in Communications.\" </p><p>   Mr. Pinette declined to comment further when reached late on Friday. A Meta spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   Mr. Pinette was known as someone who tried to build cordial relations with reporters. </p><p>   Beginning in September, The Wall Street Journal published a series of articles, called The Facebook Files, that revealed harm caused by the social-media company's platforms, as identified by its own researchers, and its challenges in addressing them. The articles were based in part on thousands of documents produced by an internal whistleblower. </p><p>   The disclosures were the subject of multiple congressional hearings and pushed the company to put a tighter lid on internal research. </p><p>   In an article last month, the Journal reported that Meta Chairman and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg had ordered subordinates to respond more forcefully to the bad publicity. </p><p></p>",
