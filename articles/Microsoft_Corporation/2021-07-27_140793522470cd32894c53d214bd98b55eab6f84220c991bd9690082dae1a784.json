  "text": "<p>The Biden administration has said it will maintain its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bcfe0c9a-56cb-42ea-a897-bd3dbebd2213\">Covid-related travel bans</a> for the foreseeable future on a range of countries, including the UK, the EU and China, due to the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant.</p> <p>The comments from the White House will dash the hopes of many European countries and airlines that the US would relax its long-held bans in time for the start of the summer holidays.</p> <p>Early optimism about restoring international travel has been dented by the rapid spread of the Delta variant and the toughening response of the Biden administration and some of the bigger states and cities.</p> <p>Anthony Fauci, Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, said over the weekend that the number of new cases in the US was “going in the wrong direction”, especially in areas with low vaccination rates. He also said the government was discussing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef8daa94-c28e-4d43-ad11-4ad99c423524\">tightening guidance on mask use</a> to help contain the spread of the Delta variant.</p> <p>California and New York City announced yesterday that they would require public employees <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e3d3edc-6a0b-461d-aed9-2e0e1e8a2f35\">to get a Covid-19 vaccine</a> or submit to weekly testing in a move designed to boost inoculation rates. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Gayle Smith, head of global Covid-19 response at the US state department, has told the Financial Times that she wants US vaccine makers — which include Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson — to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2421cddf-763a-4e80-8725-cf2080ab86b8\">share technological expertise</a> with international rivals who can make the vaccines at a lower price point.</p> <p>Her comments follow criticism that the US is not doing enough to boost supplies in developing countries struggling to contain&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa4f248a-a476-491d-a5ce-f128360e9f24\">the spread of the Delta variant</a>.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Chinese stocks sink</strong> <strong>for a third day</strong> Chinese tech stocks fell sharply again today as fears of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f958def-6657-4283-8998-2954909a3465\">a growing regulatory crackdown</a> spread. Shares in Tencent, one of China's biggest tech groups, fell the most in a decade after it suspended user registrations to upgrade its security software to comply with new government guidance. Today's edition of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6035da74-dd39-42f2-9501-0140466f40cb\">Unhedged</a> looks at the growing discount investors are attributing to Chinese markets compared to their western counterparts.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>In other markets news:</strong> The returns investors expect to earn after inflation on 10-year US Treasuries fell <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71d6661d-7a62-4a5f-959b-4cb2f1e94d68\">further below zero</a> to reach a record low yesterday, with sweeping implications for global markets.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2.

Elon Musk used the upbeat moment to announce he would no longer take part in most Tesla earnings calls.</p> <p><strong>3. Jeff Bezos offers Nasa $2bn discount for lunar contract</strong> Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin has offered to cover $2bn in costs in exchange for being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51f95019-407d-4c55-a6de-0a0586ca85d5\">awarded a Nasa contract</a> to help land astronauts on the moon as soon as 2024. The offer comes a week after Blue Origin successfully carried out its&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f23e08b-8279-4233-9e04-a609ef70c18c\">first manned flight</a>&#xa0;to the edge of space.</p> <p><strong>4.

Aon's chief executive Greg Case said the companies had reached an “impasse” with the US justice department.</p> <p><strong>5. Ex-lover sues Spain's former king over ‘unlawful surveillance' </strong>Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, former lover of ex-King Juan Carlos of Spain, is suing him in the High Court in London, accusing the former monarch and the Spanish secret service of putting her under <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/3792b1fd-557f-421c-9ea4-9da3a5feacc7\">illegal surveillance</a> in the UK.</p> <h1>Tokyo Olympics round-up </h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Naomi Osaka</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99ede2a4-7450-404f-b1ef-06d877a4f7ec\">the face of the Tokyo Games</a>, is out of the Olympics after a shock defeat in straight sets to Marketa Vondrousova of the Czech Republic.</p></li>  <li><p>US swimmer <strong>Lydia Jacoby</strong> won <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99ede2a4-7450-404f-b1ef-06d877a4f7ec\">gold</a> in the women's 100-metre breaststroke.
