  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Adventure & Travel -- Atlanta: From Hub To Hotspot --- The South's business travel epicenter has morphed into a happening vacation spot, best explored neighborhood by neighborhood",
  "text": "<p>For a more manageable bite of the ATL, as locals call it, I've devised guides to five distinct areas -- three here and two others that you can find at wsj.com/news/life-work/travel.com.</p><p>Buckhead</p><p>Undoubtedly the ritziest neighborhood in Atlanta proper, Buckhead has roots that date to an 1830s general store, where, as legend has it, owner Henry Irby mounted a buck's head on a stake outside the building to give visitors a landmark. The city's northernmost section has become a thoroughly modern financial district, full of manicured neighborhoods, historic houses (some of which survived the burning of Atlanta in 1864) and a sense of both established and aspirational wealth.</p><p>THE STROLL: Bobby Jones Golf Course, named for the Atlanta-born golfing great, is a public, reversible 9-hole course that lies near Buckhead's southwestern edge, adjacent to the Atlanta Beltline's walkable mile-long Northside Trail. At the Murray Golf House, you'll find the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame, a pro shop for anything you forgot to bring, and Boone's restaurant, overlooking the course. Boone's is a good spot to lunch or take in the setting sun over the city's skyline while enjoying pimento cheese fritters and neat pours of whiskey (2205 Northside Drive NW).</p><p>THE REFRESHMENT: The Garden Room, a posh greenhouse with cocktails, tends to be booked a month in advance. The small-plate menu includes snackable indulgences such as Chilean sea bass, but you're mainly here to sip mixed drinks such as the Talk Tiki To Me, local craft ciders and beers or wine from its mile-long list (88 West Paces Ferry Road NW).</p><p>THE MEAL: For a cheeseburger with cheffy finesse, book a table, in the courtyard or sunlit dining room, at the Chastain, overseen by chef Christopher Grossman, whose resume includes top tables like Napa Valley's the French Laundry (4320 Powers Ferry Rd.).</p><p>THE ESSENTIAL STOP: Tucked into the side streets of Buckhead Village are luxury stores from Hermes to Dior, Todd Patrick to Christian Louboutin. To browse contemporary works by regional artists, among others, stop by Buckhead Art &amp; Company.</p><p>THE STAY: A short walk from Buckhead Village, the 10-story Thompson hotel opened late last year with 201 rooms overlooking the upper end of Peachtree Road and its surrounding skyscrapers. Only guests in suites or 9th-floor rooms can access Tesserae, the hotel's invite-only rooftop club, but anyone can dine at Dirty Rascal, an Italian restaurant from James Beard semifinalist Todd Ginsberg (from about $290 a night).</p><p>Westside</p><p>Made up of dozens of smaller neighborhoods, the historic, still-gritty Westside didn't become one of Atlanta's hottest parts of town overnight. It's an odd mix of warehouses built along old railway lines, college campuses and Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home of the Falcons and Atlanta United. Coming soon: a 90-acre Microsoft campus now in development. Scrappier and trendier than Buckhead, the Westside attracts both top culinary talent and chic boutiques.</p><p>THE STROLL: Opened to the public last year, Westside Park is now the city's largest public greenspace. You'll find a playground, a dog park, 2.5 miles of bicycle and walking paths, and a scenic central reservoir. A boring machine named for Westside native Killer Mike, the \"Run the Jewels\" rapper, helped fill the reservoir with 2.4 billion gallons of water.</p><p>THE MEAL: Mujo -- which started as a carryout omakase pop-up born of the pandemic -- is now one of Atlanta's toughest-to-book and priciest restaurants. Overseen by chef J. Trent Harris, alum of Michelin-starred restaurants in New York and Tokyo, Mujo offers just 15 seats (691 14th St. NW).</p><p>THE REFRESHMENT: Swing by Rooftop L.O.A, an indoor and outdoor restaurant, pool and garden. Though Miami and Mykonos inspired its resort-like design, its view of the Midtown skyline reminds you exactly where you are. Order a jade-colored French 75 made with fresh celery and take in the scene (1115 Howell Mill Rd. NW).</p><p>THE ESSENTIAL STOP: New fall sports coats, cashmere sweaters and twill trousers have hit the racks at Atlanta's standard-bearing menswear shop, Sid Mashburn. Adjoining women's apparel shop Ann Mashburn trades in silk dresses, leather boots and more. (1198 Howell Mill Rd. NW)</p><p>THE STAY: At the 16-story Epicurean hotel, in West Midtown, the numerous eating options begin at the open kitchen of Reverence restaurant in the lobby, and run all the way up to 9th-floor Aerial Kitchen &amp; Bar. Check the event calendar for blind wine tastings, cooking classes and other events in the theater (from about $290 a night).</p><p>Midtown</p><p>The center of gravity in Atlanta, Midtown is one of the most convenient places to stay if you're planning to visit multiple neighborhoods in one trip. Bonus: It's home to the impressive High Museum of Art, and it's located near the Beltline, 22-miles of unused railroad tracks that are currently being repurposed as cycling and walking paths and parkland.</p><p>THE STROLL: Take a day to tour the Martin Luther King, Jr., National Historical Park, which encompasses several buildings around Auburn Avenue in the Old Fourth Ward. Don't miss Ebenezer Baptist Church (where Dr. King preached Sunday sermons); the King Center, which displays some of his writings; and the eternal flame near Coretta and Martin's tombs at the King Center (450 Auburn Avenue, NE).</p><p>THE MEAL: While Atlanta has no shortage of winning breakfast restaurants, Erika Council's Bomb Biscuits are among the best in this highly competitive biscuit-baking town, particularly when crafted as \"Glori-Fried\" chicken sandwiches (660 Irwin St NE).</p><p>THE REFRESHMENT: Ticonderoga Club, at the Krog Street Market, is a cozy, eccentrically furnished cocktail den that offers well-priced wines, various ways to enjoy Sherry (glass, bottle or flight) and first-rate cocktails like the Hootchy Cider Punch (99 Krog St.).</p><p>THE ESSENTIAL STOP: Among the most significant city landmarks to open in the last decade is Ponce City Market, housed in a 2.1-million-square-foot building that once served as a Sears, Roebuck and Co. retail and distribution center, on the Beltline's Eastside Trail. Whether you're looking for a flower shop, bookstore, women's or men's apparel, toys or furniture, there's plenty to purchase, plus a wide-ranging food hall downstairs, a carnival-inspired rooftop area and always a steady flow of visitors (675 Ponce De Leon Ave. NE).</p><p>THE STAY: Embracing its somewhat seedy history as part of its beguiling appeal, the 1920s Hotel Clermont energetically reopened in 2018, with 94 restored rooms and public areas (including a panoramic-view rooftop and a French-American restaurant) and quotes from Atlanta hip-hop group OutKast etched on room safes. The building's basement is still home to Atlanta's oldest strip club, Clermont Lounge (from about $190 a night).</p><p>---</p><p>For additional guides to East Atlanta and Southside/Downtown, see wsj.com/news/life-work/travel.</p>",
