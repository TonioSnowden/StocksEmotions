  "text": "<p>I've been wondering this week about the looming identity crisis among CEOs and senior leaders. During the pandemic we heard all about compassionate leadership, with CEOs making carefully curated pronouncements about their caring approach. But is that still right for the tough decisions associated with our new economic uncertainty? </p> <p>Perhaps we should look to leaders in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, who still tend to stick with “paternalistic” leadership styles. As Michelle Zheng writes in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e37ea95-d402-4dc4-91fb-08d5d70ae8ac\">fascinating FT article:</a> “The Chinese approach is a combination of the authoritarian (asserting absolute authority and control over subordinates and demanding unquestionable obedience); the benevolent (a holistic concern for subordinates' personal or familial wellbeing); and the moral (superior personal virtues, self-discipline and unselfishness).”</p> <p>Michelle, who is a professor at China Europe International Business School, thinks there are lessons for western CEOs here. While none of these traits is exactly fashionable now, it did send me back to the fact that the uncertainty that engulfs everyone at work applies also to CEOs, who are meant to be leading huge organisations in a dynamic and purposeful way. </p> <p>Sometimes, though, humans really like certainty in a leader. That's probably a key motivator (as well as a love of power and possibly huge insecurity) for those CEOs who have developed a cult-like aura around them — the subject of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/874029d5-4746-4f91-9e21-8486c83d05a5\">a thought-provoking FT column</a> by Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson. </p> <p>So my question this week is: how should a CEO be? I am so confused. Tell me what you think works best in this strange climate, without using jargon — please — and we will print the best comments. We are at <a href=\"mailto:workingit@ft.com\">workingit@ft.com</a>. It's the question of our age, I think. </p> <p>Read on for Sophia's report on why pay transparency is becoming a big deal for many workers — and it's definitely here to stay.

Ian White, CEO of ChartHop, a people analytics tool with features to manage compensation, says he's also seen the pandemic “accelerate” conversations about pay.</p> <p>Now rising inflation and the increasing cost of living are fuelling demand for pay rises. Workers' preferences about the type of compensation they receive has also shifted. “People just want more cash,” says Tobi, whose clients are increasingly focused on base salaries rather than stock options, which are more vulnerable to market downturns.</p> <p>Pay transparency can help us to climb the career ladder. When we know how much our peers are making, “it's easier to advocate for yourself,” says Tobi. Ian adds that he's seen an increase in people sharing spreadsheets of salary data, often anonymised, in industries from tech to media and finance. And platforms like <a href=\"https://www.teamblind.com/\">Blind</a>, <a href=\"https://www.levels.fyi/\">Levels.fyi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.repvue.com/\">RepVue</a> — and even corners of <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@salarytransparentstreet\">TikTok</a> — encourage users to disclose their salaries.</p> <p>Pay transparency is also showing up in US legislation. Colorado's Wage Transparency Act, which requires job postings to include a salary range, went into effect at the beginning of 2021. New York City's Wage Transparency Law takes effect on November 1, and California is not not far behind. California governor Gavin Newsom has just signed a bill that requires nearly 200,000 companies in the state to <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/california-employers-to-disclose-pay-ranges-with-newsom-signing\">publish pay figures</a> from next year onwards. </p> <p>Companies are also grappling with how to approach location-based pay. As remote work increases and workforces become “distributed”, some companies (like <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/compensation/pages/google-renews-location-based-pay-debate.aspx\">Google</a>) have decided not to pay Silicon Valley or Wall Street rates to employees in regions with lower costs of living. Other companies (like <a href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/location-independent-salaries/\">Buffer</a> and ChartHop) have taken the position that compensation is for the value of the work rather than a reflection of physical location, and have universal pay bands, regardless of location. </p> <p>Budgets for employee salaries are also showing signs of change. Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/compensation/pages/microsoft-to-nearly-double-salary-budgets-expand-stock-compensation.aspx\">doubled its budget</a> for merit-based rises in May. Ian says companies are increasingly considering not only how much to spend on recruiting, but how much to hold back for retention.</p> <p>Giving priority to recruiting budgets can be point of aggravation among existing workers. When our requests for a pay rise are rejected, it gives the impression that “companies would rather pay to replace you than just give you the raise,” says Tobi. Recruiters charge high fees, typically taking a 10-30 per cent cut of a new hire's salary. Giving that 10 per cent directly to an existing employee who's at risk of quitting would be “life-changing” for that person, says Tobi. Companies who don't invest in retention budgets are “hypocritical, because [they] will say it's cheaper to keep a customer [than recruit new ones]”, but they don't act the same way when it comes to their own staff, he says. <em>(Sophia Smith)</em></p> <p><em><strong>Would you share your salary figure with a colleague? </strong></em><a href=\"https://compass.pressekompass.net/compasses/financial_times/would-you-share-your-salary-with-a-colle\"><em><strong>Take this week's poll to weigh in</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> <h1>Listen in: the secret world of office slackers</h1> <p>This week on the Working It podcast we shine a light on <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/gPBKEPVr\">the hidden world of office slackers</a>, who have little or nothing to do. In a world of overwork and burnout, some staff have the opposite problem. It sounds like fun, but for many, it's demotivating. What can you do if this happens to you? I chat to author David Bolchover, who was once one of these lost workers. </p> <p>Meanwhile in Japan, the “unsackable slacker” is a fixture of many big corporate offices. I talk to Leo Lewis, an FT colleague based in Tokyo, about workplace culture that allows some senior staff (mostly men) to be idle while younger workers seethe with resentment. We mention the late David Graeber's book, <em>Bullshit Jobs</em>, in passing — but it's a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6fa6cfc-52d2-11e8-b24e-cad6aa67e23e\">key text for understanding the phenomenon</a> of “pointless” jobs.</p> <p>Next week we have an episode that's designed to help anyone afflicted with a colleague who drives you up the wall. My FT colleague Taylor Nicole Rogers is the guest host, speaking to Amy Gallo — whose book <a href=\"https://store.hbr.org/product/getting-along-how-to-work-with-anyone-even-difficult-people/10482\"><em>How to Get Along with Anyone (Even Difficult People)</em></a> is highly recommended if you want to delve further into the world of the insecure boss and the biased co-worker (and many more common office types).

We've just recorded an episode of the Working It podcast on this topic. So many of us are middle managers, but what exactly is our role? And how can we best evolve for the modern workplace? Here's what our readers have to say: </p> <p>Here's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1740fb3-bd69-4c8d-a322-8b59332de568?commentID=d4c266f1-f89f-4318-97dc-5e87578586c9\"><strong>RLL</strong></a> on the generational issues we often talk about (or moan about):</p> <blockquote>  <p>I do get tired of managers saying the next generation cannot do what they do. Every generation has its leaders and managers who will rise up. Everyone thought the Baby Boomers would amount to nothing. Boomers thought today's managers didn't exist. Perhaps the problem is our own blindness to the potential of young people. They will make the same mistakes we made and they will manage and lead as well as us as they mature.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1740fb3-bd69-4c8d-a322-8b59332de568?commentID=79135224-3df1-4524-a364-eaf8d95e5d5c\"><strong>Italian _Owl</strong></a> takes a more pessimistic view:</p> <blockquote>  <p>The middle manager is just a filter for the inevitable complaints coming from below. The senior management don't want to hear those (and ultimately don't care).</p> </blockquote> <p>And <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1740fb3-bd69-4c8d-a322-8b59332de568?commentID=10a055b7-7946-4d28-a9ff-6b6405a5684d\"><strong>BrexitBites</strong></a> thinks it's all about context: </p> <blockquote>  <p>It really depends on a project — if you are starting something new and are skilled/experienced, being a team lead is a breeze.</p>  <p>On the other side, if you are joining a badly managed project with disillusioned team members and delusional management, there is nothing worse than that. </p> </blockquote> <p>Thanks for all the feedback — our Working It episode on middle managers, featuring one of the world's foremost experts on the subject, professor <a href=\"https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/quy-huy\">Quy Huy of Insead</a>, airs next month.
