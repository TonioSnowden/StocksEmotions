  "title": "Videogame Designers Give Players Gender-Neutral Character Options; Developers wrestle with linguistics to bring players customizable pronouns and gender-neutral characters",
  "text": "<p>\"I think about it like [the game] is a house, and you're trying to build a new foundation underneath,\" said John Faciane, associate producer of \"The Sims 4,\" a life simulation game published by Electronic Arts Inc. that plans to introduce they/them and custom pronouns to gameplay in the next 12 months. \"The foundation of how text and localization works in the game was built back during initial development, so restructuring how that works to add customizable pronouns involves a lot of planning and research.\"</p><p>\"The Sims\" will join a crop of independent and mainstream games offering a wider spread of character gender designations or nonbinary signifiers. The latest game in the \"Forza Horizon\" Xbox series, for example, lets users choose between three pronoun options and select the pitch of their characters' voices. And the Nintendo game \"Animal Crossing: New Horizons\" asks users to select a character's \"style\" rather than gender, and has characters refer to each other as \"they\" or \"them\" within the game.</p><p>The move toward offering more options for in-game genders comes as videogame companies hire more diverse teams and build for more diverse audiences, said Mia Consalvo, a professor of game studies and design at Concordia University in Montreal.</p><p>Ten percent of adult gamers in 2020 were LGBTQ+, according to a study from marketing research firm Nielsen Holdings PLC. Eight percent of that group said they were either transgender, nonbinary, agender or gender fluid, or chose not to disclose their sexual orientation or gender identity.</p><p>In the past decade, gamers who wanted to play as nonbinary characters, or give them they/them pronouns, had to customize games' codes with hacks known as \"mods.\"</p><p>The rise of live videogame streaming on sites such as Amazon.com Inc.'s Twitch, and the formation of larger gamer communities on platforms such as Reddit Inc. and Discord Inc., means players making these do-it-yourself modifications can easily showcase and share their work and suggestions with developers, since many now hire employees to monitor and interact with players on social media, Prof. Consalvo said.</p><p>\"The companies are paying attention, and then you also see the players getting more vocal,\" she added. \"They're saying, 'Hey, we're creating new things, why can't you? Why can't it be in the original version of the game?'\"</p><p>But building they/them profiles and nonbinary gameplay isn't always straightforward for designers. Lines of script must sometimes be rewritten or rerecorded, and doing so isn't often as simple as swapping \"him\" or \"her\" for \"they,\" said Greg Kasavin, creative director of Supergiant Games LLC's \"Pyre,\" a role-playing fantasy game that includes a nonbinary playable character option.</p><p>\"A character who formally addresses the player with 'Reader sir' or 'Reader madam' simply calls them 'Reader' under the gender-neutral option, and another older, fancy-gentleman character refers to you as 'my boy' or 'my girl,' or 'my kin' under the gender-neutral option,\" he said.</p><p>Translating from English to other languages poses more obstacles, said Kela van der Deijl, the Netherlands-based lead creator of \"Mail Time,\" an adventure game slated to be published by Freedom Games later this year. Ms. van der Deijl had originally planned to do away with pronouns altogether in the game set in a fantasy forest filled with critters, because most of the dialogue happens between two characters that refer to each other as \"you\" she said.</p><p>\"But for example, in Japanese, it's difficult to avoid using gendered language, and in French verbs are conjugated differently based on your gender,\" Ms. van der Deijl said.</p><p>The team behind \"Mail Time\" is therefore wrangling with linguistics to bring gender-neutral pronouns to the game in eight languages, Ms. van der Deijl said. The designers of \"Pyre,\" which was released in 2017, chose to limit the gender-neutral option to English-only, due to the cost, time and complexity of translation, Mr. Kasavin said, noting that, at the time of development, gender-neutral terminology hadn't been formally reconciled in some languages.</p><p>At Electronic Arts, the producers of \"The Sims\" are leaning on the translation expertise of the company's localization teams to figure out linguistic solutions, although the first version of the customizable pronouns feature will be in English, a spokeswoman for the game said.</p><p>The producers of \"The Sims\" have been working on the option for a year, building an option for players to input custom pronouns, such as \"ze/zir/zirs,\" as well as choose between the more common \"he/him,\" \"she/her\" and \"they/them.\"</p><p>They told players the feature was in the works last month after noticing more players specifically asking for the option on forums and channels, as well as via a petition started by a nonbinary Sims Twitch streamer known as Momo Misfortune, said Phill Ring, the game's executive producer.</p><p>The addition won't only improve gameplayâ€”it will help normalize the use of chosen pronouns offline too, Mx. Misfortune, who uses the gender-neutral honorific, said.</p><p>\"If a kid's growing up playing a game and they're like, 'Oh, I can pick my own pronouns,' it could really help them on their journey,\" they said.</p><p>Write to Katie Deighton at katie.deighton@wsj.com</p><p>Videogame Designers Give Players Gender-Neutral Character Options</p>",
