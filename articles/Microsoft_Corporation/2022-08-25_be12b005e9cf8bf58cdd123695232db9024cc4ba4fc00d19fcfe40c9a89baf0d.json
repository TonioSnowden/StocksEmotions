  "text": "<p>A group of Turkic origins, the Karaims moved north and west from Crimea at the end of the 14th century. They first settled in Lithuania 625 years ago, according to the Lithuanian government. Vytautas, the grand duke of Lithuania, invited around 300 Karaim families to serve as bodyguards and traders. Many settled on a peninsula between the grand duke's two castles in Trakai, the former capital of Lithuania which this year marks its 700th anniversary. The road became known as Karaim Street. Some also went to Poland, which was in union with Lithuania at the time. Today there are only a few hundred Karaims left in each country, yet they try to retain their unique culture.</p><p>Around 200 members of the ethnic minority from Lithuania, Poland and the diaspora in Turkey, Europe and elsewhere came to Trakai for festivities held last week in their honour. (The war in Ukraine meant the 500 or so Karaims who live in Crimea, as well as those from mainland Ukraine, could not attend.) Karolina Cicha, an award-winning Polish folk artist, and her ensemble gave a spellbinding performance of Karaim music on August 17th.</p><p>Many of these songs draw on musical influences from Poland, Russia, Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine—places the Karaims have inhabited—and tend to be sung a cappella. Yet Ms Cicha's rendition of “Troch Szaharda” slid mellifluously between the microtones of Middle Eastern music, punctuated by plucked lute and string instruments including the kamancheh, a Turkish fiddle, with layered, intricate rhythms. Several local Karaim singers, dressed in traditional caps and braided jackets, performed some of the swaying melodies with Ms Cicha.</p><p>The lyrics whirled through traditional food and customs familiar to the rapt audience, who sometimes joined in. “Ijisi baraskinin” (“The smell of Fridays”) dwells on typical dishes such as kybyn pasties and evokes the odour of Karaim Street as busy cooks prepare for Saturday, the holy day. (The Lithuanian Karaims practise an Old Testament religion that used the Hebrew alphabet until some time in the 20th century, but is distinct from Judaism.) “It's not only a food song,” explains Ms Cicha. “It's a song about the local and the universal, the sun and the moon. Everything is joined, but Trakai is the centre of the world.”</p><p>Just as kybyn have become popular across Lithuania, a wider audience is beginning to appreciate Karaim music. Last year Ms Cicha released “Karaim Music Map”, which claims to be the world's first album devoted to Karaim music, crafted with modern arrangements. The project includes an online map, which traces the origins of Karaim songs. Before the year of the Karaims had been announced in Lithuania, Linas Rimsa, a prolific Lithuanian composer, had begun writing the score for an operatic drama based on a Karaim legend. “The Saga of a Given Heart” had its premiere in Trakai castle on August 19th and 20th. Mr Rimsa augmented Karaim melodies with powerful percussion, strings, brass and choral singing. The spectacle was filmed for national television and will tour other cities in Lithuania.</p><p>This warm reception partly reflects the fact that the Karaim, unlike many minorities, have been welcomed in their adopted homes. Launching the Year of the Lithuanian Karaim in May, Ingrida Simonyte, Lithuania's prime minister, said that the people were a “unique treasure” who enriched the country's present and future. Karina Firkaviciute, a musicologist and the chairwoman of the Lithuanian Karaim Cultural Society, explains that her people have never been subject to discrimination, despite their differences from the rest of the Lithuanian population. “The community has always had a very good name, so there was no need to treat people otherwise,” she says.</p><p>Some Karaims are pleased that outsiders such as Ms Cicha are curious about their heritage, which is growing increasingly fragile as the number of Karaims diminishes. Only 2,000-3,000 are thought to exist globally. “I feel very thankful that people from Poland are interested and are helping us to show our culture,” says Dominika Kobeckite, a 19-year-old Karaim from Vilnius who entranced viewers by singing a duet about unrequited love in Ms Cicha's concert (pictured, top).</p><p>unesco considers Karaim, a Turkic language, to be severely endangered, with an estimated 50 fluent speakers left. Elijas Robacevskis, an 11-year-old Karaim from Lithuania who lives in London, learns Karaim every Sunday on Skype. He also played the violin during the festivities. “Whenever we have birthdays or weddings there's always singing and dancing,” he says. “Even though the Karaim language is dying out, at least we have the music and it's always in our hearts.”</p><p>■</p>",
