  "title": "Greenwood Acquires The Gathering Spot, in Joining of Black-Owned Businesses; The digital banking platform founded by Andrew Young, Ryan Glover and rapper Killer Mike sees opportunity in getting closer to members of the private nationwide club",
  "text": "<p>Greenwood was founded in 2020 by media executive Ryan Glover, rapper Michael Render, whose stage name is Killer Mike, and former U.S. ambassador and Atlanta mayor Andrew Young. The company works with Mastercard Inc. and Everett, Wash.-based Coastal Community Bank to deliver banking services, including debit cards.</p><p>Greenwood says it has 30,000 account holders and more than $40 million in assets.</p><p>The Gathering Spot, also known as TGS, says it has more than 12,000 paying members representing major U.S. companies and organizations, including Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., and the National Basketball Association. Memberships run from $100 to $250 a month, with annual rates and corporate packages available.</p><p>\"When you zoom out, this is an example of Black-on-Black M&amp;Aâ€”two companies that are Black-owned, strengthening each other,\" says Paul Judge, an entrepreneur and Greenwood board member.</p><p>Greenwood's name is inspired by the historic Greenwood district of Tulsa, Okla. Before the neighborhood was destroyed in the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, it was a center of entrepreneurship known as Black Wall Street.</p><p>TGS was launched in 2016. It offers spaces for professionals to work, meet and socialize. Sen. Raphael Warnock (D., Georgia) and entertainers Issa Rae and Ludacris have participated in TGS-affiliated conferences, performances and public events. It has also hosted events in New York, Chicago, Detroit, Houston and Charlotte, N.C.</p><p>Ryan Wilson, co-founder and chief executive of The Gathering Spot, will become Greenwood's chief community officer as part of the deal.</p><p>He says he and TK Petersen, co-founder and chief financial officer of TGS and incoming Greenwood vice president, have discussed wealth-building, personal finance and growing small businesses since conceiving TGS as Georgetown University dormmates.</p><p>\"The conversation has shifted, from starting things to now, how do you scale them? What does national scale look like? What other industries and uncommon combinations can we come up with?\" Mr. Wilson says.</p><p>TGS already offers membership perks such as healthcare services and access to its on-site restaurant and bar. Under the Greenwood umbrella, it plans to offer more events featuring high-profile partners, including the hosts of the \"Earn Your Leisure\" personal-finance podcast, along with banking perks, including access to private golf clubs affiliated with Mastercard.</p><p>Since its launch in 2020, Greenwood has twice postponed the full rollout of its banking services, in moves that executives attributed to higher-than-expected demand. It says it has 800,000 wait-listed customers.</p><p>Martina Edwards, a Georgia-based community-development finance executive and one of the first Black female traders on the New York Stock Exchange, sees Greenwood's delayed launch as a sign that it intends to ensure its banking services are functional. Some Black banks have failed to gain traction because of missteps, she says.</p><p>\"While I want to be loyal to you as a customer, because I'm a Black person, just to give you that shot, if you can't deliver and make my life seamless and easy, and my banking system match what I already had, it's going to be difficult for you to keep me on your platform,\" says Mrs. Edwards, who has no business ties to either company.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How has professional networking changed for you in recent years? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Still, she says Greenwood has a unique opportunity because of The Gathering Spot's ties to the entertainment industry and young professionals.</p><p>With access to entrepreneurs actively pursuing partnerships and ways to execute their business goals, Greenwood's leaders say they hope for a surge of investment opportunities coming directly from paying members.</p><p>Combined, Atlanta-based Greenwood will now have more than 200 employees working to deliver to its expanded customer base.</p><p>Mr. Young, one of Greenwood's founders, says the company is focused on work similar to what he did with Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s. Mr. Young was an aide to Mr. King at the time.</p><p>\"You can't end poverty without being part of the great American economy. The way most people get involved in that economy is through banking or investing,\" he says.</p><p>Greenwood Acquires The Gathering Spot, in Joining of Black-Owned Businesses</p>",
