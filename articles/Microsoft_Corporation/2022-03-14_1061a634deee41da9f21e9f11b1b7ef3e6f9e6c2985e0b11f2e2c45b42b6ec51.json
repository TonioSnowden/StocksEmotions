  "title": "5G Technology (A Special Report)  ---  Forget 5G. Let's Talk About 6G:  The next generation promises to make mobile internet truly ubiquitous  ----  By Chris Kornelis",
  "text": "<p>   As wireless carriers jostle to see who can win the race to deliver 5G services to customers, planning is already well under way for what comes next. </p><p>   Yes, we're talking about 6G. </p><p>   That might seem premature, since 5G has a long way to go before most consumers and businesses have it -- let alone take advantage of it. But computer scientists and engineers say that 6G has the ability to take cloud computing and the mobile internet to true global ubiquity. </p><p>   \"High-speed services available anywhere, anytime,\" says Thyaga Nandagopal, senior adviser for technology, innovation and partnerships at the National Science Foundation. </p><p>   Adds National Science Foundation Director Sethuraman Panchanathan: \"This next generation will make societies more equitable by opening up opportunities to anyone, regardless of geography, class, race, gender, ethnicity or disability, and augment human lives in unimaginably positive ways.\" </p><p>   Around the world, governmental, scientific and commercial entities are working together to invest in and eventually standardize technologies that will accomplish the lofty goals of 6G. </p><p>   Once truly global, high-speed connectivity is achieved, 6G is expected to provide the structure necessary for \"things that right now seem like science fiction,\" says Theodore Rappaport, founding director of NYU Wireless, a New York University research center whose work encompasses wireless and electrical engineering, computer science and medicine. \"Totally immersive, 3-D virtual reality on phone calls and on meetings over wireless, true remote surgery and remote monitoring, the idea of the metaverse -- these kinds of things will start to emerge in 6G.\" </p><p>    Ranveer Chandra, head of networking research at Microsoft Research, Redmond, expects a jump in performance from 5G to 6G. Download speeds could jump to 100 gigabits per second from 10, he says. Network capacity will increase exponentially. </p><p>    Andre Fuetsch, executive vice president and chief technology officer of network services at AT&amp;T, says he is expecting a revolution in consumer devices in a 6G world. </p><p>   \"The smartphone of the future is really going to be more around glasses,\" says Mr. Fuetsch. With processing and storage offloaded to the cloud and running at 6G speeds, he says, immersive experiences using lightweight smartglasses will be the new normal, rather than staring at the screen of a phone. </p><p>   Significant changes could be ahead for education as well, both in terms of equality of access to the latest teaching methods across the country, and as a way of revolutionizing how lessons are taught. The NSF's Dr. Panchanathan describes how technology using 6G is being developed that uses virtual-reality headsets to create immersive simulations of environments and places that for many students would be unreachable. </p><p>   To Mr. Chandra, the most important change coming will be the breakthrough in being able to provide internet access to people who still lack it, whether for economic reasons or because service hasn't reached their part of the world yet. A report from the International Telecommunication Union last year noted that 37% of the world's population didn't have access to the internet. </p><p>   In agriculture, Mr. Fuetsch says, greater positioning accuracy will help farmers seed their crops more efficiently, with more density and increased yields. </p><p>   Experts say that predictions made today just scratch the surface of what's possible with 6G. Once the underlying technology is made available, they say, inventors and entrepreneurs will use it to develop new products and services. </p><p>   \"This will light up scenarios which none of us had thought about,\" says Mr. Chandra. \"We can't always predict what these would be, but they will change our lives, mostly for the better.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Kornelis is a writer in Bremerton, Wash.
