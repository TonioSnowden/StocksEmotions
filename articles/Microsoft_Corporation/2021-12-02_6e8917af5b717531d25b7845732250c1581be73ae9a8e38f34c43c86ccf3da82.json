  "text": "<p>An app that helps Christians connect to God has attracted investment from several celebrities and heavyweight investors including Andreessen Horowitz and SoftBank's Latin America Fund, in a deal that values it at about $250m.</p> <p>London-based Glorify's $40m series A funding round on Thursday included investors such as venture capital firm K5 Global, reality TV star Kris Jenner and singers Michael Bublé and Jason Derulo.</p> <p>Glorify was founded last year by British entrepreneur Ed Beccle and Henry Costa, the son of investment banker and evangelical Christian Ken Costa, who is the company's chair.</p> <p>The new funding will be used to expand internationally and create new content. Glorify is hiring in San Francisco, New York and London, according to LinkedIn job posts.</p> <p>This round follows a spike in interest from investors in religious and faith-based apps during the pandemic, when many religious ceremonies could only be held online. Venture capital investment into US religion and faith apps has almost doubled since last year, surpassing $19.3m in 2021, according to deals data from PitchBook.</p> <p>Glorify offers users a daily worship routine including Bible passages, inspiration quotes and audio prayers and reflections, and said it aims to improve users' sleep and lower their anxiety.</p> <p>“We've created an experience that not only helps Christians maximise their daily quiet time in a way that fits their lifestyle and personal needs, but empowers Christians, young and old, to open themselves up to faith again,” said Beccle.</p> <p>Glorify offers a similar service to the non-religious Calm app, which has successfully partnered with celebrities such as Matthew McConaughey, Idris Elba, Kate Winslet and Harry Styles to offer guided sleep stories and meditations, and is valued at $2bn.</p> <p>Glorify has 1.8m users, 250,000 of whom use the platform every day, according to the app. Its users are based mainly in the US and Latin America.</p><p>Source: Cristina Criddle in London 2021 'SoftBank and celebrity investors back Christian app in $40m funding round ' FT.com 2 December.
