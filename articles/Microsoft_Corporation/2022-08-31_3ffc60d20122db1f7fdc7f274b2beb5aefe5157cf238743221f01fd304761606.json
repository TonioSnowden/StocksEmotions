This sector remains the cheapest on a forward P/E basis.</p><p>While oil prices pulled back in August, the U.S. energy industry had a banner second-quarter earnings season. Looking further ahead, those results led to a 12% increase in the S&amp;P 500 energy sector's consensus earnings-per-share estimate for 2023.</p><p>Year-to-date, the communications services sector has been the worst performer. Bear in mind that several of this sector's worst stocks of 2022 are actually tech-oriented, including Netflix Inc. NFLX, the biggest loser among the S&amp;P 500 this year with a 63% decline through Aug. 30. The communications sector also includes Meta Platforms Inc. META (Facebook's holding company), whose stock has fallen 53% this year, and Match Group Inc. MTCH, down 57% for 2022, including a 23% decline in August.</p><p>Within the information technology sector, two of this year's worst performers have been PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL, down 51%, and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, which is down 47%. Nvidia is the largest semiconductor company in the S&amp;P 500, with a market cap of $386.7 billion. The company's value has declined by an astounding 348.6 billion this year.</p><p>Citigroup analyst Christopher Danley warned on Tuesday that semiconductor stocks could drop another 25% as they enter \"the worst downturn in a decade.\"</p><p>The S&amp;P 500's worst and best performers</p><p>Here are four lists of the S&amp;P 500's worst and best performers for August and for 2022:</p><p>Worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks in August </p><p> Company                                         Ticker   Price change – July 29 through Aug. 30   Price change – 2022 through Aug. 30   Price change – 2021  SolarEdge Technologies Inc.
