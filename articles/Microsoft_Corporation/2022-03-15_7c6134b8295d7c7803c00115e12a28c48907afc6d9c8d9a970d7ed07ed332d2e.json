  "text": "<p>Take-Two said on Jan. 10 it plans to buy mobile-game publisher Zynga in a deal with an enterprise value of $12.7 billion. The merger will create a videogame giant generating more than $7.5 billion in annual net bookings; mobile games are expected to account for more than half of that in its fiscal year ending in March 2023 compared with about 12% for Take-Two now. But Take-Two's long-term projection for the combined company that was issued during the announcement sent a strong signal about its existing business, which is reliant on games for Xbox and PlayStation. That was affirmed by its S-4 filing on Monday, in which Take-Two projected its stand-alone net bookings would surge 34% to $5.2 billion in the year ending March 2024.</p><p>Such a jump would come only from one of its few major game franchises -- and none is larger than \"Grand Theft Auto.\" Analysts expect sales from the series to total nearly 20 million units for the fiscal year ending this month, according to consensus estimates from Visible Alpha. The online version is projected to generate about $666 million in recurring revenue for the same period.</p><p>Rockstar Games, the franchise's developer, confirmed in a tweet last month that \"active development for the next entry in the series is under way.\" In a note to clients in January after the deal announcement, Doug Creutz of Cowen said Take-Two's initial projection for the combined company's financial performance implied about $5 billion in net bookings for Take-Two alone in fiscal 2024, which \"management could not promise that with any degree of certitude unless they also assume that GTA 6 is launching.\"</p><p>It won't be smooth sailing up to that point. Take-Two projected a 5% drop in net bookings for the fiscal year ending later this month and a 15% gain in fiscal 2023 -- both of which were below Wall Street's forecasts. The stock fell 7.6% Monday after the filing.</p>",
