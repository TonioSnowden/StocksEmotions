  "text": "<p>US stock indices inched higher on Tuesday, building on gains made in Monday's session to close at fresh record highs off the back of strong corporate earnings.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shot to record levels shortly after Wall Street opened. Both indices retraced some of those gains in New York hours, with the Dow roughly unchanged at the closing bell and the S&amp;P marginally higher for the day, up 0.2 per cent. </p> <p>The moves take the S&amp;P's year-to-date gains to 22 per cent, having also hit a record high on Monday.</p> <p>Tuesday's ebullience was in part attributable to strong results from the likes of UPS and General Electric on Tuesday morning, which closed up 6.9 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively. Investor optimism ahead of results from technology companies including Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet after the bell on Tuesday also buoyed stock markets. Both Google and Microsoft beat earnings expectations.</p> <p>The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite climbed 1 per cent at the US open, but closed up less than 0.1 per cent. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the Europe-wide Stoxx 600 share index closed up 0.7 per cent, touching a level not exceeded in more than two months. London's FTSE 100 closed up 0.8 per cent, even though shares in Entain dropped as much as a 10th on the news that the US betting group DraftKings <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae1b143f-3735-488b-a510-37f77f2dddf9\">would not make a firm takeover offer</a> for the gambling company.</p> <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng share index closed down 0.4 per cent, damped by declines in real estate stocks as it emerged that the Chinese developer Modern Land had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5248fe9d-c7e2-46dc-964a-7b8307183e6b\">missed a payment</a> on a dollar bond worth $250m, in the latest signs of troubles in China's property sector.</p> <p>US oil prices <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c05f2254-589b-436b-b468-6e25e43b31ae\">topped $85 a barrel</a> for the first time in seven years on Monday as traders wagered that crude supplies would not keep pace with global demand, against the backdrop of a widening energy crunch that has also propelled natural gas prices skywards. West Texas Intermediate, the US oil benchmark, settled up 1.1 per cent to $84.65 a barrel on Tuesday.</p> <p>Larry Fink said on Tuesday that it was highly probable that oil would reach $100 a barrel, according to a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/high-probability-oil-reaching-100barrel-says-blackrock-ceo-fink-2021-10-26/\">Reuters report</a>. The chief executive of BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, was speaking at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>In government debt markets, the yield on the US 10-year Treasury note fell by 0.02 percentage points to 1.61 per cent. The yield on the UK gilt equivalent was down 0.03 points to 1.10 per cent. Bond yields move inversely to their prices. </p> <p>Traders globally are primed for announcements about monetary policy tightening and the tapering of pandemic-era bond-buying programmes, as governments respond to persistent inflationary pressures. The European Central Bank will meet on Thursday, while the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England meet next week.</p> <p>Ahead of the UK budget on Wednesday, John Wraith, head of UK rates strategy at UBS, noted that government bond prices were picking up from recent lows, in “anticipation that we might see potentially quite a sizeable cut to gilt issuance numbers for the current fiscal year”.</p><p>Source: Kate Duguid in New York and Harriet Clarfelt in London 2021 'Wall Street hits record highs as corporate earnings flurry continues' FT.com 26 October.
