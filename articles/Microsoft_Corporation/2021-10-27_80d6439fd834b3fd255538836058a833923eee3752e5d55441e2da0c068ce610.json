  "text": "<p>Transport operator <strong>FirstGroup</strong> has launched a tender offer that will rid itself of Coast Capital Management, the activist fund that had successfully lobbied to oust chief executive Matthew Gregory.</p> <p>FirstGroup set out plans to return up to £500m to shareholders via a tender at 105p a share, a &#xa0;9.2&#xa0;per cent premium to Tuesday's closing price of 96.15p. It said that Coast, a 12.8 per cent shareholder, had given an irrevocable undertaking to support the resolutions and tender its full holdings.</p> <p>New York-based Coast <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd06ad33-86d4-4f04-bb61-70081a3a6ac1\">waged a long campaign</a> against FirstGroup's board and management, including a push to separate its US and UK operations. Most recently it accused management of bungling the $3.1bn sale of its US bus business, saying the disposal&#xa0;to Swedish private equity group EQT significantly undervalued the business and “stinks to the heavens”.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Rishi Sunak</strong>, chancellor of the exchequer, will claim that he has successfully&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/ASObE8sArzzgpRtJqt6MMw~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRjW2HaP0Q7aHR0cHM6Ly9mdC5jb20vY29udGVudC8zZmUxODEzNy1hNGNmLTRiZDEtOTk4NS0xNjY5YjgwODAxNmJXCGZpbnRpbWVzQgphdvXceGH2WSCJUhJicnljZS5lbGRlckBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\">steered the economy</a>&#xa0;through the Covid-19 crisis today, unveiling a Budget that will combine a new commitment to fiscal discipline with extra spending on essential public services and measures to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.</p> <p><strong>Wickes</strong>, the home improvement retailer, said it remained on track to hit full-year targets. Sales last quarter moderated by 1.6 per cent against the pandemic-inflated 2020 result but were up 16.3 per cent versus the same period in 2019, Wickes said in a trading update.</p> <p><strong>Bloomsbury Publishing</strong> raised its interim dividend after delivering a more than trebling of half-year earnings. The book publisher reported a half year pre-tax profit of £11.1m, from £3m the year before, on revenue up 29 per cent to £100.7m. Bloomsbury noted continued supply chain problems but reiterated guidance for its financial year ending February 2022, saying that its non-consumer titles would provide insulation from what was likely to be a competitive Christmas.</p> <p>Package holiday company <strong>On The Beach </strong>said it was still unable to provide any financial guidance for the 2022 financial year ending September, in spite of a recent pick-up in bookings. The company's year-end trading update gave no financial metrics other than reporting cash excluding customer deposits in excess of £55m and a £75m undrawn credit facility.</p> <p><strong>Aveva</strong>, the industrial software maker, said underlying organic revenue grew 9 per cent in the six months to September. All business lines improved total fees with a “particularly strong” contribution from its recently acquired OSIsoft business, the company said in a half-year trading update.</p> <p>Home emergency assistance service <strong>HomeServe</strong>&#xa0;said it had agreed to buy CET Structures, a UK peer, for £53m.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Alphabet</strong>, Google's parent company, and <strong>Microsoft</strong> both posted&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/273aeecb-57a8-40f8-a2ba-8a21a635b289\">strong revenue growth</a>&#xa0;in the third quarter, while Twitter swung to a loss, as the three US tech companies released results.</p> <p><strong>Banco Santander</strong> reported a €2.2bn of profit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5b386c7-a6ff-4bc8-982a-549b850beeb9#post-deef3f99-d915-473a-aa3a-34a06a7610ef\">for the third quarter</a>, 24 per cent ahead of the same period last year, as the Spanish lender benefited from its relative strength in the US and UK markets as well as from digitalisation.</p> <p><strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>'s third quarter net profit attributable to shareholders rose by 7 per cent to €194m, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5b386c7-a6ff-4bc8-982a-549b850beeb9#post-951f43cd-0a86-4ecc-9e84-8723d1004107\">beating analyst expectations</a> of €135m.

It is necessary to cut emissions by close to 40 per cent by 2030, instead. The curve of emissions must be bent downwards now.”</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'FirstGroup squeezes out activist via a share sale' FT.com 27 October.
