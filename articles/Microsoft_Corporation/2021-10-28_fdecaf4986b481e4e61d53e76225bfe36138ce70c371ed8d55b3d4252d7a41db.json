  "text": "<p>Good morning. When you write about markets, it is easy to get lost in the high-level data, and things start to look simpler than they really are. So I spent my day on Wednesday looking at earnings results and reading the conference call transcripts from honest-to-goodness individual companies that reported this week. Below, some highlights. </p> <p>I'm taking tomorrow off. See you next week. While I'm gone, read <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/energy-source\">Energy Source</a>, a great FT newsletter. You can sign up for it by clicking <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/subscribe?newsletterIds=5655d099e4b01077e911d60f\">here</a>. </p> <p>As always, you can email me your thoughts at: <a href=\"mailto:robert.armstrong@ft.com\">robert.armstrong@ft.com</a>&#xa0;</p> <h2>A few messages from the corporate coal face&#xa0;</h2> <p>What follows is anecdotal and idiosyncratic, obviously. I picked companies to look at because I thought their results might be important to what is going on in markets and the economy generally, not because their results were good or bad, or I think it would be smart to buy the shares. Mostly, I looked at big companies that face the consumer directly. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>If you have noticed any interesting titbits in company earnings, by all means, tell me about it. Anyway, some interesting things:</p> <p><strong>McDonald's: wages are hot but there is ample pricing power.</strong> McDonald's sales were pretty strong all over the world in the quarter, as you might expect when its getting easier for people to go out to eat again. But same-store sales growth was 10 per cent versus the same quarter in pre-pandemic 2019. Impressive, even if it was just slightly weaker than the second quarter's growth. But the main thing I wanted to hear about was how hard it is to get someone to work in a McDonald's right now. Here is what the chief executive had to say about that:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Our franchisees are increasing wages. They're [experiencing] over 10 per cent wage inflation year-to-date. We're seeing in our [company-owned] restaurants [wages] up over 15 per cent . . . we're also seeing that it's just very challenging right now in the market to find the level of talent that you need. And so for us, it is putting some pressure on things like operating hours, where we might be dialling back late night, for example, from what we would ordinarily be doing. It's also putting some pressure around speed of service . . . it's not unsolvable . . . [but] I was hoping and expecting that we were going to see the situation improve maybe a little bit more quickly than what's materialised. And I think it is going to continue to be a difficult environment for the next several quarters.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fast food restaurants are a big employer of low-skilled workers. McDonald's is an ubiquitous competitor in the industry. They are seeing wage increases of 10 per cent or more. That seems important to me. The Atlanta's Fed's <a href=\"https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker\">wage growth tracker</a>, which uses a three-month moving average, is reporting wage growth for hourly workers at less than half that level, and Bureau of Labor of Statistics <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CES0500000003#0\">numbers</a> show the same. </p> <p>On commodity costs, the picture is a little more benign, with the company expecting a 3-4.5 per cent increase for the year. But they key point is that McDonald's thinks that between higher sales and increasing prices, margins will up in the quarter and for the year. It has increased prices by 6 per cent versus last year, and “so far, it's been received OK by customers”.</p> <p><strong>Coca-Cola: pricing power again.</strong> In the pandemic, Coke's sales volumes were whacked by falling away-from-home sales, but they rose 8 per cent this quarter, and for the first time they were higher than in 2019. But price and product mix contributed another 6 per cent to sales in the quarter. As a result, gross margins expanded a bit (as they did at McDonald's), despite a mid-single digit rise in commodity costs (which means sugar, plastic and aluminium, I suppose).&#xa0;People will still pay up for sugar water. </p> <p><strong>Penske Automotive: good news on margins, bad news on supply chains.</strong> Penske operates car, truck and parts dealers, in the US, Europe and Japan. We have been hearing a lot about shortages of cars and parts, and it is clear from the company's results that inventory is flying off the lots. Gross margin was up almost two percentage points, to 18 per cent. But the most interesting things the company had to say were about trucks — big, commercial trucks — and the lack of them. Here is chief executive Roger Penske: </p> <blockquote>  <p>When you look at the demand with the [truck manufacturers], it's almost a 13-month backlog . . . and that's going to drive this business for the next 12, maybe even 24 months. And that's what's driving the used truck prices up because today, most of the fleets can't get their new trucks right now. So they're running their old trucks, maybe another five to six months. And that's also helping drive this used truck value, but I don't see it slowing down. And to me, right now, the biggest issue is the number of trucks that are sitting at these [manufacturers] without parts.</p> </blockquote> <p>Penske was asked if the main problem was computer chips. Nope:</p> <blockquote>  <p>People don't realise they're air freighting tyres [from abroad] now. [It's] lots of things other than just chips on the heavy-duty truck side . . . When you look at the manufacturing businesses, plants are losing people . . . I talked to one [truck manufacturer] the other day, and they said, any one day, they could be down 25 per cent of their workforce. So how do you run your plant? People don't show up on Monday morning.</p> </blockquote> <p>Yikes. Sounds like supply tightness is going to persist for years — a message <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13359b28-7207-4892-8547-8922617c62c2\">echoed</a> on Wednesday by executives at . . . </p> <p><strong>General Motors and Ford: chippy.</strong> Both companies saw revenues fall in the quarter, and operating leverage shifted into reverse, hurting margins. But the problem seems to have been supply, not demand. Here is Ford's chief financial officer on the chip shortages:</p> <blockquote>  <p>We do see the chip issue continuing to run through ‘22. As we said, it's very dynamic. Right now, you ask us what we think the sequential increase in supply will be year-over-year, we think we'll have about 10 per cent more, but that's changing weekly . . . But we do see that running through 2022. It could extend into 2023, although we do anticipate the scope and severity of that to reduce as we move through ‘22 into ‘23.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Visa: payments volumes are strong, but not getting stronger.</strong> Visa turns out useful charts on spending on their network. This one shows spending levels by month, indexed to the same month in 2019, before the pandemic. Credit card spending levels are recovering strongly, but not enough to offset the slowdown (from a very high level) in debit spending growth. The consumer is very strong, but maybe not getting much stronger from here. </p> <p><strong>Microsoft and Google: absolute juggernauts.</strong> Even the Faangs saw sales slow down in 2020. But boy oh boy have they come back stronger than ever. Microsoft's revenue is 37 per cent above pre-pandemic levels. Google's is 60 per cent higher, its strongest two-year growth since 2012. Google noted that a lot of the strong growth in its core advertising business was from retailers — retailers, it appears, think it worth spending lots on ads to reach customers. Microsoft grew strongly in almost every business segment (other than hardware). Business demand for technology and tech services is absolutely booming right now. </p> <p><strong>Tentative summary:</strong> The consumer appears strong (but maybe not getting stronger); wages may be rising faster than the headline official data suggests; at many companies, there is pricing power to offset rising costs; supply chain problems will be with us all the way through 2022; and big tech is still, fearsomely, big tech.</p> <h2>One good read</h2> <p>When rating agencies warn of systemic risks, it's hard not to respond with a smirk. Those are precisely the risks the agencies are rightly famous for missing in 2008. But perhaps Moody's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/862d0efb-09e5-4d92-b8aa-7856a59adb20\">has a point</a> about the private credit industry, and the fact that it creates high leverage at small companies — and then makes that leverage hard to monitor. Right now, of course, high leverage doesn't matter, because debt is so absurdly easy to refinance or roll over. But that won't always be true, if history is any guide.</p><p>Source: Robert Armstrong 2021 'What we're learning from earnings   ' FT.com 28 October.
