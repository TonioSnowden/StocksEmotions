  "text": "<p><em>Buongiorno </em>and welcome to Europe Express! </p> <p>In this edition, we will look at today's G20 health summit in <strong>Rome</strong>, which EU officials expect to turn into a vaccine-pledging exercise. Donations from governments are likely and potentially as many as 1bn Covid-19 jabs to be sold by pharmaceutical companies to lower-income countries at production cost. </p> <p>G20 leaders will also pledge to boost vaccine production and engage in voluntary licensing and pooling of patents in their final statement, according to a draft statement seen by Europe Express.</p> <p>We will also explore the issues ministers of finance will grapple with today and tomorrow in <strong>Lisbon</strong>.</p> <p>And we will hear from <strong>Berlin</strong>, where the three main candidates for the position of German chancellor held their first debate on European issues.</p> <h2>A summit in Rome</h2> <p>The EU has been battling with an image problem when it comes to Covid-19 vaccines policy, given its open scepticism about the US's bold push for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eca86f43-7127-4213-948d-3cc8d652805e\">patent waivers</a>, writes <em><strong>Valentina Pop</strong></em> in Brussels. That is a source of immense frustration in Brussels, given the enormous quantities of jabs the bloc has been exporting to the rest of the world. </p> <p>The G20 health summit in Rome — co-hosted by Mario Draghi, Italian prime minister, and the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen — offers Team Europe (a term officials use to describe the EU institutions plus its 27 member states) the opportunity to chalk up some points of its own. </p> <p>First, there will be pledges. That does not just mean donations from governments to Covax, the international vaccine procurement programme co-led by the World Health Organization, Cepi and Gavi. But officials also expect manufacturers to pledge to sell up to 1bn doses at production cost. </p> <p>Second, the draft statement skirts the vexed topic of vaccine patent waivers, which are backed by the US, India and South Africa. Instead, there is plenty of talk about what the EU has been trying to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/694f0efd-ba49-4eec-b7c5-f38e0a02313b\">drum up support for</a> all along.</p> <p>That includes boosting production capacities, facilitating trade and transparency across value chains, and sticking to existing World Trade Organization rules that allow for voluntary licensing, voluntary technology transfers and patent pooling on mutually agreed terms between companies and governments. </p> <p>In addition to the G20 members, the summit will also hear from the leaders of guest countries, including Singapore and Switzerland, the WHO, the WTO and the IMF, as well as philanthropist Bill Gates and Hugh Evans, organiser of the Vax Live concert. </p> <p>Most leaders will be tuning in virtually and some will send pre-recorded messages. </p> <p>In other good news for the EU, a protracted fight between governments and the European parliament over the cost of Covid-19 tests required for travelling ended yesterday, allowing for a political deal on the digital certificate scheme the bloc wants to make summer travel easier.</p> <p>Whether any of that will suffice to fix the EU's image, remains to be seen.</p> <h2>The great divide</h2> <p>One of the many nasty consequences of Covid-19 is the worsening of the already serious economic divisions that run through the European single currency area, writes <em><strong>Sam Fleming</strong></em> in Brussels.&#xa0;</p> <p>To their credit, EU governments spotted the danger fairly early in the crisis as the Italian and Spanish economies buckled, and they managed to agree a historic joint borrowing package last summer to funnel hundreds of billions of euros to the worst-hit areas.&#xa0;</p> <p>But as finance ministers gather in Lisbon for informal meetings today and tomorrow, there will be little time for self-congratulation.&#xa0;</p> <p>A paper from Bruegel, a think-tank, to be discussed by ministers tomorrow, underlines the multiple ways in which the pandemic could still pull away at the fabric of the European economy. </p> <p>While the lifting of lockdowns is paving the way for economic rebounds this summer, the impact is expected to be uneven. Recent official forecasts suggest some countries, such as Italy, will reach pre-pandemic levels of GDP only by 2023, while others such as Poland will surpass it this year. The differing structure of economies — including the relative importance of tourism — as well as severities of lockdowns help explain the picture. </p> <p>The likely wave of corporate insolvencies that will follow once public support starts to be reduced will also vary in severity from country to country. The number of companies&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c843dd94-91f7-444d-a3c7-5e0d7dd160d5\">going bankrupt</a>&#xa0;in the eurozone last year fell by a fifth, despite the record-breaking recession. But the government support that cushioned businesses will eventually have to be withdrawn.</p> <p>At the same time, governments that keep too many unviable companies afloat will only impair their own country's economic potential by contributing to business “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13918a23-db39-48fd-b812-4fc9c1d82698\">zombification</a>”, observed one EU senior official. </p> <p>Divisions are also manifest in the labour market, with the young and less educated suffering more heavily during the pandemic-induced recession, Bruegel noted, warning of the risk of widening income inequalities. </p> <p>Given the forces pulling EU economies apart, finance ministers' focus is firmly on the implementation of the €800bn Next Generation EU recovery plan, which is targeted at some of the worst-hit economies and aims to bolster their long-term prospects. But some member states, including France, are already asking what comes next, as they examine ways of putting more money into projects that bolster Europe's longer-term growth potential. </p> <p>Among the most important policy questions is ensuring that government investment is not yanked prematurely — a topic likely to feature prominently in the Lisbon meetings, given that net public investment is forecast to remain well below US levels as a share of GDP next year. Addressing such vexed fiscal matters will inevitably take ministers down the path towards reform of the EU's labyrinthine and growth-unfriendly budget rules but that is a debate for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c086307e-4ad6-482a-ac45-9722270ea2a4\">much later </a>this year. </p> <h1>Chart du jour: Fuelling the green revolution </h1> <p><em>Europe's emissions of fossil fuels in 2020 dropped by 10 per cent compared to 2019 levels according to estimates. The drop can probably be chalked up to the lockdowns imposed to contain the coronavirus rather than the effect of green policies. But </em><a href=\"https://ember-climate.org/project/eu-power-sector-2020/\"><em>renewables did overtake fossil fuels</em></a><em> in electricity production in the bloc, a promising sign for policymakers trying to achieve the EU's pledge to become carbon neutral by 2050.</em> </p> <h2>German mixed messages</h2> <p>For German politics watchers, the first <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2485c88-9d7e-4e22-bb29-af92531c2129\">debate</a> between the three candidates to succeed Angela Merkel as chancellor was probably best summed up by Bild, the country's leading tabloid: a “snooze summit”, writes <em><strong>Erika Solomon</strong></em> in Berlin.&#xa0;</p> <p>But there were still important hints during the discussion of what the rising Green party has in mind on foreign policy.</p> <p>On some issues, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45ec0c68-706c-419e-ad56-343c1ae913b0\">Annalena Baerbock</a>, Green leader, and her party are proving to be more hawkish than the centre-right Christian Democrats and the centre-left Social Democrats.&#xa0;</p> <p>Baltic, central and eastern European states have long felt ignored as Germany's mainstream parties — coalition partners in the current government — push to finish the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22555df1-0b88-4d46-8287-9e0c8f03cc6a\">Nord Stream 2 pipeline project</a> that will bring natural gas from Russia. </p> <p>EU members from the former eastern bloc — and the US — argue the pipeline will only increase Europe's energy dependency on Moscow. The Greens are offering a chance to change course on a pipeline that is more than 90 per cent completed and Baerbock did not mince her words.</p> <p>“In case of doubt, this is about war and peace,” she said during yesterday's debate broadcast by WDR, adding that the pipeline was akin to taking away Ukraine's geostrategic defences against Russia.&#xa0;</p> <p>But while Baerbock may have raised some hopes among eastern Europeans, she also showed how the Greens could antagonise them. </p> <p>When&#xa0;the debate kicked off with a question about what most frustrated the candidates about the EU,&#xa0;the CDU's Armin Laschet and SPD's Olaf Scholz offered the usual answers about bureaucracy and sluggishness. Baerbock offered something slightly less expected: “the unanimity principle”, she said without hesitation.</p> <p>She was referring to the many EU policies, including foreign affairs, that require consensus among all member states. And while Scholz and Laschet joined her in that position, they suggested moving towards that goal gradually. </p> <p>Baerbock, however, was less willing to compromise. She pointed to several examples of the EU's failure to reach unanimity, such as not agreeing to call for a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas due to objections from Hungary. “I consider that really fatal,” she said. (Israel and Hamas <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8aa0bee9-85e7-4cdf-82d5-e23475312f1c\">did a agree to a ceasefire</a>, last night.)</p> <p>The Green candidate also addressed other matters that make politicians in Warsaw and Budapest squirm: tougher climate change targets and a deal on redistributing migrants that has long been stymied by vetoes from eastern states.</p> <p>This might have costs for Germany, too, she acknowledged. But that was a risk Berlin and Europe's less powerful players would have to take.&#xa0;</p> <p>“We [should not] just pay lip service here,” she said. “Europe is always an uphill battle.”</p> <h1>Two things to watch today </h1> <ol>  <li><p>G20 summit on the Covid-19 health crisis takes place virtually from Rome </p></li>  <li><p>Two-day informal meeting of EU economy and finance ministers starts in Lisbon </p></li> </ol> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Pav Gill, the reluctant whistleblower that brought down Wirecard, the German financial technology company, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d74221e-1321-4f8c-9ca9-a4371629f178\">talks to the FT</a> about his experience and what he thinks needs to be done to protect employees who call out misconduct. </p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2021/05/myths-and-misconceptions-debate-russia/myth-08-we-must-drive-wedge-between-russia-and-china\">Chatham House</a>, the think-tank, takes on the 16 myths and misconceptions about Russia, arguing that well-meaning efforts to improve relations with Moscow are doomed to fail and that “there is little prospect of Russia becoming a more constructive and co-operative partner for western governments”. </p></li>  <li><p>The Draghi government is shifting the priorities of Italian foreign policy towards the EU, the transatlantic relationship and multilateralism, according to the <a href=\"https://ecfr.eu/publication/romes-moment-draghi-multilateralism-and-italys-new-strategy/\">European Council on Foreign Relations</a>. This marks a break with the previous two governments, which were intent on partnership with China and Russia.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Recommended newsletters for you</h1><p>Source: Valentina Pop, Europe Express editor 2021 'Europe seeks to boost image on vaccines at G20 health summit' FT.com 21 May.
