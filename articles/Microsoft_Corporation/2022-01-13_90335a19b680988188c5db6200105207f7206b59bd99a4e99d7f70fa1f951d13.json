  "title": "Microsoft Board to Review Company's Sexual Harassment and Gender Discrimination Policies; Report to summarize results of investigations, including those into allegations against Bill Gates",
  "text": "<p>\"Our culture remains our number one priority and the entire Board appreciates the critical importance of a safe and inclusive environment for all Microsoft employees,\" said Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella in a statement announcing the board's plans. \"We're committed not just to reviewing the report but learning from the assessment so we can continue to improve the experiences of our employees. I embrace this comprehensive review as an opportunity to continue to get better.\"</p><p>The review will be conducted by law firm Arent Fox LLP, which the board selected because the firm has experience in these matters and hasn't done a significant amount of work with Microsoft previously, the company said.</p><p>Arent Fox is expected to submit its findings to Microsoft senior management and board members with recommendations. The company expects to be able to share a summary of the results of the findings with the public in the spring, the company said.</p><p>The law firm's review is expected to lead to the public release of a Microsoft transparency report detailing the effectiveness of the company's workplace policies related to sexual harassment and gender discrimination, the company said. It will include data on the number of sexual harassment cases investigated and what the results were. The report is expected to summarize the results of investigations into Mr. Gates as well as other senior leaders, the company said.</p><p>A Wall Street Journal report, citing people familiar with the matter, last year said Microsoft board members pursued an investigation in 2019 into the billionaire's prior romantic relationship with a female employee. Mr. Gates stepped down from the board in 2020. In the Journal article, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gates said the affair had ended amicably close to 20 years earlier and that his decision to leave the board wasn't related to any investigation.</p><p>Microsoft on Thursday said the board's latest plans go beyond the shareholder proposal by comparing Microsoft's policies against the best practices on harassment and gender discrimination issues that have been adopted by other companies.</p><p>Write to Aaron Tilley at aaron.tilley@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft Board to Review Company's Sexual Harassment and Gender Discrimination Policies</p>",
