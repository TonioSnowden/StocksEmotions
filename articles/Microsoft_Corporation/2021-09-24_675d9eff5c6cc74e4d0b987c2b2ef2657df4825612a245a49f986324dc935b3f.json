  "title": "What People Should Leave Off Their Résumés (but Rarely Do); Some experiences are almost always irrelevant, and should be eliminated to make room for more important things",
  "text": "<p>The most effective résumés focus on what hiring managers need to know, and leave off the details they don't. The less space taken up by nonessential information, the easier it is for the person reading the résumé to focus on the salient details. In my career, I have read thousands of résumés and can attest to how easy it is to lose track of what I want to learn about a candidate when a résumé is filled with unnecessary words.</p><p>Here are the kind of details that are almost always irrelevant on a résumé but that many people mistakenly believe are essential:</p><p>* Physical addresses: Employers communicate with candidates via email or phone, so providing a street address is unnecessary. Be certain to include your personal (not company) email address, as well as the URL to your LinkedIn profile.</p><p>* Past and current employer locations: Where a company is located doesn't impact your value proposition. If it's important for employers to know that you worked for a company in another region or country, include that in the summary of your qualifications. Otherwise, it won't affect your candidacy.</p><p>* Descriptions of each employer: Your résumé is meant to market you, not your employer(s). It is usually obvious from the bullets detailing your responsibilities what type of company you worked for if it actually matters, and usually it doesn't. What may matter is the size of the company, and whether it has a global footprint; you can weave this information into the bullets that describe your responsibilities and your accomplishments in each role.</p><p>* Academic coursework: Listing courses taken while earning a degree or certification tells employers nothing about your abilities; it only speaks to your attendance. Neither does a GPA, which only demonstrates that you were a good student. Even if you are a recent college graduate, a better strategy is to write about a group project, a case study you wrote or a hypothetical model you built while in school. These types of details demonstrate to employers what you are capable of far better than a course list or GPA.</p><p>* Employment history over 15 years in the past: Anything you did that long ago is likely done differently today, especially in technology fields. If you want employers to know that you worked for a prestigious company a long time ago, you can mention it in the summary section of the résumé or add a parenthetical \"earlier employment at XXXX\" at the end.</p><p>* Graduation dates: Ageism is tough to avoid, so don't make it easier for employers to know how old you are until they have learned about your expertise. The proper place to include your graduation date is on the job application that employers use to conduct background checks. You also should leave off your school's location. If you attended a university outside of the U.S. with a name that isn't recognizable to U.S. employers, put the country name in parentheses after the name of the school.</p><p>* Employment that doesn't align with your current or future profession: If you're a math teacher who is taking steps to become a data analyst, writing about your classroom experience doesn't help employers assess your abilities to work with data. Mention that you were a math teacher in your prior career, but focus the résumé on what was covered while earning certification in data analytics.</p><p>More in experts</p><p>* The Covid Class of 2021 Has Unique Strengths and Weaknesses. Employers Should Be Prepared</p><p>* Why I Leave My Phone in the Car From 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Every Night</p><p>* How to Take Your Startup Seriously but Not Personally</p><p>* A Four-Step Money Plan for College Graduates</p><p>Just as marketers can't create a demand for products that are no longer relevant, you can't successfully market yourself to future employers if your résumé doesn't demonstrate what makes you qualified for their open position. What you leave off your résumé matters, as it clears the way for hiring managers to zero in on why they should arrange an interview.</p><p>You can write to Ms. Spiegel at reports@wsj.com.</p><p>What People Should Leave Off Their Résumés (but Rarely Do)</p>",
