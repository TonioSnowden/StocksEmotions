  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Tech Results Spotlight Economic Upheaval",
  "text": "<p>Sagging consumer appetite for goods amid soaring inflation, the strong dollar and supply-chain disruptions were only some of the factors that left their imprint. Tech companies are seeing the effects in everything from lower online retail activity and slumping sales of wearable devices, to small businesses investing more cautiously in their IT.</p><p>\"We are in a very difficult macroeconomic state,\" Amazon's Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said Thursday, though the online-retail juggernaut delivered 7.2% sales growth. \"We are cognizant that things can change quickly,\" he said on a call with analysts and investors.</p><p>Intel CFO David Zinsner also signaled his concern about the wider economic backdrop after the company cut its full-year sales outlook by as much as $11 billion. \"We expect macroeconomic conditions to continue to soften with the potential for a recessionary scenario to materialize,\" he said on a call.</p><p>Sales of both goods and services are being negatively affected. Intel said it expects the PC market to shrink 10% from 2021, and Microsoft reported a sales drop in videogames. Google parent Alphabet Inc. said advertisers are pulling back spending. Meta said the average price for an ad fell 14% in the most recent quarter, after declining 8% in the first quarter of the year. \"The situation seems worse than it did a quarter ago,\" said Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>There were a few pockets of business that largely escaped the upheaval. Apple Inc. posted better iPhone sales than Wall Street had expected.</p><p>More broadly, though, executives had to parry analysts' questions about weaknesses in their business, even as they went out of their way to talk up long-term prospects for their respective products and services. Combined, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta still reported higher quarterly sales than in the year-earlier period, but they were more than 1% lower than in the year's first quarter.</p><p>Robert Cantwell, portfolio manager of the tech-heavy Compound Kings exchange-traded fund at Upholdings Group LLC, said he believes the tech companies might have hit bottom. \"It is more likely than not that these are the worst growth rates you're going to see from these companies for the next few years,\" he said.</p><p>Shares in the tech-heavy Nasdaq are down around 13% since the second quarter kicked off through Friday.</p><p>The globe-spanning corporate behemoths also felt the sting from the rapidly strengthening dollar that erodes returns of many of their sales booked abroad. Microsoft, which had issued a profit warning in June to reflect the greenback's strength, this past week said that by the time the quarter had finished, the situation had deteriorated further. Apple indicated it expects a slightly bigger exchange rate-related earnings impact this quarter than in the three-months just finished.</p><p>The week ahead could shed more light on another sector of tech, the gig economy. Uber Technologies Inc., Airbnb Inc. and DoorDash Inc. are among those scheduled to report results and detail how they are faring with consumer wallets being squeezed by inflation.</p>",
