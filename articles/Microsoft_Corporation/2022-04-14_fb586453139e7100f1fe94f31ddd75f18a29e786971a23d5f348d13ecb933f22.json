  "title": "Scope 3 Rules Hinder Progress on Emissions, Researchers Say; Two experts call for a rewrite of Scope 3 reporting rules as scrutiny of climate disclosures ramps up",
  "text": "<p>This makes it harder to discriminate between products and services on the basis of their actual climate impact, according to Harvard Business School accounting expert Robert S. Kaplan and Karthik Ramanna, a professor of business and public policy at the University of Oxford's Blavatnik School of Government. In an article in the Harvard Business Review published this week, they say the system allows companies that aren't taking action to reduce their emissions benefit from their rivals' efforts.</p><p>If a steelmaking company invests in manufacturing processes that shrink its carbon footprint, and that reduces a widely used average figure for steelmaking emissions, the carbon accounts of every company that refers to that benchmark would improve—letting buyers and sellers of more-polluting steel hide behind the average figure.</p><p>\"Scope 3's tolerance for secondary data is a gift for companies that want to take credit for their competitors' GHG-reducing innovations without having to change their own product design and procurement processes,\" Profs. Kaplan and Ramanna wrote.</p><p>They propose phasing out the use of industrywide figures and setting up a more exacting standard in which only primary company-reported data would be accepted.</p><p>Carbon accounting is drawing growing attention from investors and regulators. GHG Protocol, a joint initiative between the environmental group World Resources Institute and a coalition of companies called the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, said last month it would review its standards, including those for Scope 3 reporting. The review was spurred partly by concerns that current guidelines could result in misleading emissions reports or allow companies to exaggerate their environmental performance, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.</p><p>David Rich, a senior associate in the climate program at the World Resources Institute, said the GHG Protocol welcomed proposals for improving reporting. But he said industry estimates are useful for building a complete greenhouse-gas inventory, even though companies should push for more high-quality primary data.</p><p>Various initiatives are aiming to generate more company-specific emissions data. Software startups are racing to trace supply-chain emissions. Big companies such as Walmart Inc. are prodding suppliers to disclose their emissions.</p><p>The current Scope 3 standard recommends that companies rely as much as possible on high-quality emissions data gathered directly from suppliers and other partners, especially in areas where they are targeting emissions reductions, and say how much of their carbon footprint was calculated that way. This primary data is often derived from the annual emissions figures disclosed by suppliers and the amount of money that the buyer spent with that supplier, although more granular information can also be used.</p><p>Alphabet Inc. said in the 2021 climate-change report it filed with environmental-disclosure group CDP that it used data from suppliers or value-chain partners to calculate 68% of its Scope 3 footprint for capital goods. To fill gaps, it used models developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and used \"published construction emissions data\" to estimate emissions from data-center construction. \"Given the lack of high-quality data on embodied emissions of hardware, equipment and buildings, the estimates are of only moderate quality,\" the company said.</p><p>In its 2021 environmental sustainability report, Microsoft Corp. said 45% of its carbon footprint for the same emissions category came from primary data. It filled gaps using emissions factors published by the U.K.'s Department for Environment, Food &amp; Rural Affairs. A Microsoft spokesman said the company is pushing to improve data quality, for instance through an updated supplier code of conduct that encourages suppliers to report their emissions to CDP. The company has also been increasing its internal carbon fee, which the spokesman said encourages internal business groups to seek reliable data.</p><p>While such measures may improve data quality incrementally, Profs. Kaplan and Ramanna are calling for a wholesale change in the accounting system. In the approach they advocate, each company would calculate the emissions of its own activity and pass that figure along the chain to its customers as an \"e-liability\"—a traceable carbon footprint for goods and services.</p><p>In the existing system, though, industry averages are sometimes the best data option, said Mr. Rich at the World Resources Institute. He said in some situations, \"high-quality secondary-data emission factors…can be more reliable than collecting primary data across many tiers of suppliers if the primary data is of low quality or not verified.\"</p><p>Write to Ed Ballard at ed.ballard@wsj.com</p><p>Scope 3 Rules Hinder Progress on Emissions, Researchers Say</p>",
