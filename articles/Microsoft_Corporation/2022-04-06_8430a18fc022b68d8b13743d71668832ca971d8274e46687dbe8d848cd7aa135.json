  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  Auditing Biden's Grand Plan for a Wealth Tax",
  "text": "<p>   In \"Biden's Better Plan to Tax the Rich\" (op-ed, March 29), Jason Furman's argument is based on highly questionable premises. To begin, unrealized gains do not \"escape taxation at death.\" Estate taxes of 40% are collected on the full value of assets, including unrealized gains. </p><p>   Next is the implication that somehow we will be better off transferring capital-allocation decisions from the likes of Warren Buffett, Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Stephen Schwarzman to the likes of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. Finally is Mr. Furman's point that this proposal will make our tax system raise revenue in a \"more progressive manner,\" overlooking that the U.S. tax code is already among the most progressive in the world. </p><p>   This plan will transfer massive amounts of wealth from the most to the least value-creating people on the planet, all to make one of the most complex and progressive tax regimes more progressive and complicated. </p><p>   Gordon Gould </p><p>   Boulder, Colo. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Prof. Furman twice writes that the government would use \"simple rules\" to calculate and administer a wealth tax. I invite the professor to pick up a copy of the Internal Revenue Code (three volumes, roughly 2,652 pages) plus the attendant regulations (19 volumes) for the \"simple rules\" that Treasury has so far devised to execute the tax laws. </p><p>   I also would invite the professor to go down to his local car dealership and purchase a car with his unrealized capital gains. He may find that his gains are not, in fact, any kind of income that can be spent, invested or otherwise used. Finally, as to his assertion that the tax would only apply to those citizens with a net worth greater than $100 million, remember the alternative minimum tax! </p><p>   John Foster </p><p>   Portola Valley, Calif. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   The proposed new tax on the rich can be considered a wealth tax, but I see it as an income tax where the definition of income is changed from a cash basis to an accrual basis. Accrual accounting requires one to recognize gains when they happen as opposed to when one converts the asset to cash. </p><p>   I have always felt that accrual accounting has been required for corporations precisely because it is so much more representative of reality, and that the only reason we have individuals pay taxes on a cash basis is to avoid the many thorny complications of accrual accounting (\"Biden's Big New Wealth Tax,\" Review &amp; Outlook, March 29). Nevertheless, in the name of accuracy, I will applaud the day when our ubiquitous computers calculate everyone's taxes on an accrual basis. Accrual accounting for government would also arrive at a significantly higher and more accurate deficit number, which might make a difference to how our lawmakers budget for the future. </p><p>   Winslow Marston </p><p>   Morristown, N.J. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Why stop at capital gains? If we can tax things that haven't happened yet, the child tax credit should be triggered at conception and the step-up in basis on estates should be available upon diagnosis of a terminal illness. </p><p>   Jack BenAry, C.F.P. </p><p>   Mill Valley, Calif. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   First, a corporation's earnings are taxed. Then, out of what is left over, the corporation pays dividends to its owners. Those dividends are taxed as income to the shareholder; notoriously, this is a second tax on the same income. The market value of a business is the present value of its expected future dividends, after taxes. If this value increases -- i.e., if there are capital gains -- then a tax on those gains constitutes a third tax on the same income. Enough already! Capital gains should be tax-free. Or else the corporate income tax should be abolished. </p><p>   Lewis E. Randall </p><p>   Freeland, Wash. </p><p></p>",
