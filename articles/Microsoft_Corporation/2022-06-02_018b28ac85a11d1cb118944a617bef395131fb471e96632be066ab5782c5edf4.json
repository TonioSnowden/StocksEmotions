  "text": "<p>Amazon will close its Chinese ebook store next year, marking the latest retreat as western technology companies scale back operations in the world's largest consumer market. </p> <p>Kindle users in China will no longer be able to purchase new books following the closure of its online bookstore in June 2023, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/84cf4073-a674-4a93-aef9-dcc1832a65cb\">Amazon</a> announced on Thursday. </p> <p>The company said that it had stopped supplying dealers with Kindle eBooks and offered a refund for customers who purchased a device in 2022. </p> <p>Amazon did not give a reason for its retreat from the Chinese ebook market, once an important source of sales. In 2016, three years after Amazon started selling its devices in China, the country <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12672dc6-a6b1-3e32-93be-fbb098c685b6\">became the largest market</a> for Kindle devices. The company has since lost market share to domestic rivals that launched their own ereader devices, including Xiaomi, iFlytek and Huawei.</p> <p>Amazon is the latest in a string of Silicon Valley companies to scale back or pull out entirely from the Chinese market. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f491744b-10a9-4f0a-b4b5-d9d8851aff24\">Airbnb said</a> in May it would shut down its China business, citing “pandemic challenges”. Microsoft's LinkedIn announced the closure of its social networking site in the country last October, replacing it with a stripped-back website listing job postings. </p> <p>Amazon will leave behind a growing customer base of digital book lovers. More than 500mn Chinese users listened to or read books on a digital device in 2021, according to research by the China Audio-video and Digital Publishing Association. China's digital reading market generated more than Rmb40bn ($6bn) of sales last year, an increase of more than 18 per cent from 2020. </p> <p>Jeff Bezos once attempted to crack China's ecommerce market, entering the country through an acquisition of a local operator. The venture <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ffe020c-6191-11e9-b285-3acd5d43599e\">came to an end</a> in 2019 when the ecommerce juggernaut shut down the local marketplace business after Alibaba's Taobao and&#xa0;JD.com ate away at its already small market share. </p> <p>Amazon will retain a presence in China through its logistics operations and cross-border ecommerce business that connects Chinese merchants to shoppers overseas.</p> <p>“We remain committed to our customers in China,” the company said. “As a global business, we periodically evaluate our offerings and make adjustments, wherever we operate.” It added it would “continue to innovate and invest where we can provide value to our customers”.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Arjun Neil Alim and Nian Liu in Beijing</em></p><p>Source: Eleanor Olcott in Taipei  2022 'Amazon to close China Kindle Store after losing out to domestic rivals' FT.com 2 June.
