  "title": "Microsoft's Activision Blizzard Deal Poses Sustainability Challenge; Software giant would have to address workplace problems at videogame maker and big gap between the companies' ESG disclosures and policies",
  "text": "<p>Sustainability-focused funds hold more than $53 billion of Microsoft shares as of Jan. 19, according to data provider Morningstar Inc., making it the No. 1 stock for such funds. That compares with nearly $859 million for Activision. ESG ratings providers often disagree about companies' sustainability credentials, but Refinitiv, Morningstar-owned Sustainalytics, MSCI Inc. and S&amp;P Global Inc. all rank Microsoft higher.</p><p>Activision's ESG problems prompted Microsoft to pursue the acquisition, as accusations of sexual harassment and workplace misconduct weighed on the videogame maker's share price. Addressing risks stemming from Activision's workplace culture will be a priority for Microsoft, but the ESG integration challenge won't end there.</p><p>There is a big gap between the companies' disclosures. Microsoft discloses information in separate reports covering matters such as corporate social responsibility, the environment and diversity and inclusion. Its most recent environment report alone included more than 90 data items, such as greenhouse-gas emissions and water use broken down by region, according to a review by WSJ Pro.</p><p>For example, Microsoft reports how much energy it uses from renewable and nonrenewable sources by type and region. North America accounts for Microsoft's largest use of energy, followed by the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. In North America, Microsoft said it purchased and consumed more than 6.8 million megawatt hours in the 2020 financial year, versus more than 186,000 MWh from non-renewable sources.</p><p>Microsoft said wind was its biggest source of renewable energy globally at more than 8.5 million megawatt hours, while natural gas was its biggest nonrenewable source at more than 218,000 megawatt hours.</p><p>Activision published its first ESG report last year and didn't disclose any environmental metrics. \"At this time, we are unable to collect data related to the energy and water footprint associated with our offices,\" the company said.</p><p>The videogame maker didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Microsoft declined to comment.</p><p>Activision's report suggests it is unable to gather basic environmental data on its activities, said Joe Holman, who leads the ESG practice at accounting firm WithumSmith+Brown PC.</p><p>\"It will take a significant effort to collect Activision's environmental data required to get its reporting to the same level as Microsoft,\" Mr. Holman said. He predicted it would take at least two years to collect the required ESG data at Activision.</p><p>Joachim Klement, a sustainability analyst at investment bank Liberum Capital Ltd., said Microsoft has the expertise and resources to calculate and report Activision's ESG data in around one or two years.</p><p>\"It's a bigger job than for other mergers simply because these are two large companies merging,\" he said. \"It's not witchcraft.\"</p><p>Tom Finegan, chief executive of Clarkston Consulting Inc., which advises on mergers and acquisitions, said Microsoft would likely set up a task force, supported by sustainability, investor-relations, strategy and regulatory teams, to incorporate its policies into the newly acquired business. Sustainability executives will want to gather more data at Activision and set targets to bring the company in line, he said.</p><p>Microsoft will also want to find out Activision's environmental footprint since the company uses electricity-hungry servers to support its online games for millions of players, such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, said William Emtage, associate director for sustainable business and ESG at consulting firm RPS Group PLC. Microsoft has a target of getting 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025.</p><p>A 2020 study by researchers at Lancaster University in the U.K. estimates that, depending on how quickly gamers migrate to the cloud, the emissions from videogaming could rise by between 30% and 112% over a decade.</p><p>On the social side, Microsoft will want to know about data breaches, player privacy and what Activision knows about any potential illicit activity on its online videogames, he said.</p><p>\"Often companies that have weaknesses on ESG issues are acquired precisely because of those weaknesses,\" Mr. Emtage said. \"Because addressing those weaknesses you can create more value in the acquired company over the long term.\"</p><p>Write to Dieter Holger at dieter.holger@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft's Activision Blizzard Deal Poses Sustainability Challenge</p>",
