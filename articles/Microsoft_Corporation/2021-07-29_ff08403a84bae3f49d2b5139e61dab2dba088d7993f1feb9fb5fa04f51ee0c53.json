  "title": "Technology:  Samsung Profit Increases 73% on Memory-Chip Demand  ----  By Jiyoung Sohn",
  "text": "<p>   SEOUL -- Samsung Electronics Co. offset relative weakness in smartphone shipments by capitalizing on another quarter of roaring demand for its memory chips. </p><p>   Samsung, the world's largest smartphone and memory-chip maker, is considered an industry bellwether as it is a major electronics maker and components supplier to the world's biggest tech firms, including Apple Inc. and Sony Group Corp. </p><p>   The company posted second-quarter net profit of 9.63 trillion South Korean won, or the equivalent of $8.37 billion. That represented a 73% increase from 5.56 trillion won a year earlier. </p><p>   Revenue increased 20% to 63.67 trillion won. The performance topped analysts' estimates and underscored the global appetite for digital goods and services that this week also helped lift earnings at Microsoft Corp., Apple, and mobile-phone chip company Qualcomm Inc. </p><p>   Strength with the South Korea-based company's memory business propelled its second-quarter results. Pandemic shifts have kept demand high for personal computers, data servers and mobile devices, which all require memory chips. As a result, memory-chip makers recorded growth in shipments and enjoyed greater pricing power. </p><p>   Operating profit for Samsung's chip division in the April-to-June quarter rose 28% from the prior year to 6.93 trillion won, while revenue rose 25% to 22.74 trillion won. </p><p>   Contract prices for NAND flash, which provides storage capacity on devices, rose as much as 10% in the second quarter, from the first three months of the year, according to TrendForce, which tracks chip sales. Similar prices for DRAM, which enables multitasking, surged as much as 23% during the same period. </p><p>   Samsung is the biggest competitor for both types of memory chips. </p><p>   The South Korean tech company didn't perform as strongly in the mobile-phone business as Apple, which reported on Tuesday that iPhone sales rose 50% in the second quarter. </p><p>   Covid-19 outbreaks in Samsung markets such as India sapped demand and led to some temporary plant closures in Vietnam. A component shortage curtailed the South Korean company's phone production, but the snag mostly affected less-profitable lower-end models. </p><p>   The chief of Samsung's mobile-phone division had warned previously that the global chip crunch could affect sales in the April-to-June quarter. </p><p>   Operating profit for the company's mobile division in the second quarter declined 26% from the previous quarter to 3.24 trillion won, while revenue fell 22% to 22.67 trillion won. </p><p>   \"If they had more components, they would have sold more,\" said Keon Han, an analyst at Credit Suisse. Profit held up, though, he said, on the strength of margins from sales of midrange and high-end phones. </p><p>   The components shortage is expected to continue into the third quarter, which might curtail phone shipments again. Apple said Tuesday that it was expecting supply-chain constraints in the current quarter. </p><p></p>",
