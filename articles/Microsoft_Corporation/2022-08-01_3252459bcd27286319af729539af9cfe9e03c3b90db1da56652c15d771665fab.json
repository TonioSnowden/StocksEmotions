  "text": "<p>The science clusters of Oxford and Cambridge have almost no available laboratory spaces for rent, according to new property data, raising concerns about the UK's ability to capitalise on a surge of interest in its life sciences sector.</p> <p>Investor groups and chief executives have warned that the crisis in lab space in the so-called “Oxford-Cambridge arc” is driving companies to cities such as Boston in the US, which have millions of square feet immediately available.</p> <p>Data collected by Bidwells, a property consultancy focused on the Oxbridge knowledge economy, showed availability was close to zero in June in both cities after demand surged by almost a quarter in the first half of this year.</p> <p>Sue Foxley, research director at Bidwells, said the shortage is worse than she had seen before, and many companies are being forced to lease office and other commercial space, before refitting them as laboratories.</p> <p>“The government has grand ambitions to transform Britain into a scientific superpower, but the Oxford-Cambridge arc is at threat of becoming a victim of its own meteoric rise, with the unicorns of tomorrow increasingly being locked out of mission-critical R&amp;D space,” she said.</p> <p>Alexis Dormandy, the chief executive of Oxford Science Enterprises, a £1bn investment company that partners with Oxford university to develop life <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/science\">science</a> companies, said the OSE group had invested in creating 55,000 sq ft of its own lab space in order to guarantee capacity for its start-ups. But the scarcity of laboratories was hitting the ability of smaller entities to scale up.</p> <p>“On the positive side, investment in life sciences is growing by 35 per cent a year — 50 per cent around <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/08c24788-b77b-3fa0-9b8a-1e3933d23594\">Oxford </a>— but we need to find innovative ways to invest in new lab capacity to keep up with that demand,” he said.</p> <p>Business groups said the chronic shortage of space raised questions about the government's strategy for growing the life sciences sector, where big names such as AstraZeneca, Apple and Microsoft have clustered around Oxford and Cambridge. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10762761.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>In February it emerged that Boris Johnson's government <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a9f0603-1404-4f80-a208-f5943d99ff73\">had shelved a strategic plan</a> to create a British rival to Silicon Valley around Oxford and Cambridge because it did not chime with the government's “Levelling Up” agenda.</p> <p>The move has attracted criticism, including from former chancellor Philip Hammond, who warned that plans to level up the north should not be prioritised at the expense of high-growth areas such as Oxford and Cambridge.</p> <p>“The Oxford-Cambridge arc can be a driver of prosperity across the whole of the UK but the government needs to facilitate this growth through the planning system, not stifle it because it doesn't fit with its levelling up dogma,” he said. </p> <p>More lab space is coming on stream, according to Bill Kane, president of UK and east coast markets at BioMed Realty, which pledged £850mn of investment last year to double the size of its UK portfolio. </p> <p>“The Oxford-Cambridge arc is one of the most productive and innovative regions in the world . . . However, future innovation and growth will be limited without the physical infrastructure,” he said.</p> <p>In the interim, chief executives of life science businesses are warning that the UK will lose out to the US, where Boston alone had nearly 6mn sq ft of lab space under construction in 2021.</p> <p>Mark Kotter, founder of <a href=\"https://www.bit.bio/\">Bit Bio</a>, a Cambridge-based cell technology company, said that individual US states were far better at underwriting risk to developers in order to create a steady flow of lab space.</p> <p>“The UK is extremely good at spinning out small start-ups, but not very good at building big companies. Most leave and are sold, and part of the reason for that is infrastructure that is not being provided for these companies,” he added.</p> <p>The business department said it was investing in science research and development capacity through the infrastructure fund and had committed to increase total UK R&amp;D investment to 2.4 per cent of GDP — or £22bn a year — by 2027.</p> <p>“Only last month we announced nearly £500mn to provide world-class lab space to help unlock UK researchers' full potential, as part of our £14.9bn investment in R&amp;D in this financial year alone,” it said.</p><p>Source: Peter Foster in London 2022 'Lab space shortage threatens life science boom in Oxford and Cambridge' FT.com 1 August.
