  "title": "The New Workplace (A Special Report)  ---  Second Chance to Make a First Impression:  As workers return to offices, they're encountering a rare opportunity  to reset the relationships they've formed online with colleagues  ----  By Erin Delmore",
  "text": "<p>   With covid case rates waning and vaccine boosters widely available, companies nationwide are encouraging (or in some cases, mandating) that employees resume in-office work. That means a lot of people are meeting co-workers face-to-face for the first time after years on Zoom. </p><p>   Because the brain processes online first impressions differently from ones made in person, those returning workers have a rare chance at a second first impression, resetting the relationships they have formed with colleagues online during years of working remotely. </p><p>   \"It presents a great opportunity,\" says Daniela Schiller, a professor of neuroscience and psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \"The clock starts ticking from zero, and you can form new relationships or base the relationship on new grounds now that you have more information that is available once you meet someone in person.\" </p><p>   While researchers disagree on the exact amount of time it takes the human brain to form a first impression, the time frames are unanimously fast -- from as little as three minutes in one study to one-tenth of a second in another, and down to even about 35 thousandths of a second in a third. Everything from a person's facial expression to posture or clothing choice can form the basis of an instant personality judgment. </p><p>   The implications of that cognitive snap judgment, however, are far-reaching: Decades of research shows that the way we make someone feel when we meet them for the first time is powerful. A positive first impression can prime people to see you that way going forward, and making a good first impression in the workplace can affect future career success. </p><p>   Megan Shook, a New Jersey-based project manager who works in pharmaceutical sales, was motivated to go all out before meeting her colleagues in person for the first time in October. </p><p>   She was the first fully remote person hired by her team in Colorado. But even after more than 15 months of working together predominantly on the Microsoft Teams platform, Ms. Shook, 29 years old, was so nervous about meeting her colleagues in person that she feared disappointing them. She got highlights in her hair and a manicure, and bought more new clothes than she could wear to a day and a half of meetings. </p><p>   \"They had an idea about me that had been building for over a year, and I wanted to live up to whatever that idea might be,\" she says. \"So I just wanted to present the absolute best version of myself.\" </p><p>   Ms. Shook had made a similar effort on the small screen. When she was hired during the pandemic, she carefully curated her Zoom background: She arranged books on the shelf to show she was well read, and placed a plant behind her desk to show that she could be responsible for taking care of something. </p><p>   But Dr. Schiller says making an impression in a Zoom meeting is different than making one in the face-to-face world. That's because meeting someone over a video platform throws our brains into overdrive -- less thanks to the things our attention is drawn to in the background of a person's camera and more because of what we can't see. </p><p>   \"On Zoom, you have a lot of barriers,\" says Dr. Schiller, who researches the neural mechanisms underlying emotional control and flexibility. \"There's a lot of information missing that you would otherwise have in a personal meeting, and then you have to just supplement it with speculations.\" Having to fill in that information, Dr. Schiller says, puts a burden on people to do more guesswork themselves -- which can be influenced by a person's own biases and expectations. </p><p>   But when we're in person, our survival instincts kick in to process a fuller picture rapidly. Thanks to an evolutionary history of analyzing threats within our proximity, we become more alert to the presence of another person, processing everything from their looks to their gestures to their smell. Those observations are layered along with our understanding of the place we're in and even the time of day to form a fuller picture that's ultimately easier for the brain to process and memorialize. </p><p>   One thing working in favor of those meeting longtime colleagues for the first time in person or bumping up against new colleagues at the water cooler is the element of surprise, which Dr. Schiller says could make a second first impression more memorable than the original because it captures more of our focus and attention. </p><p>   An example is registering someone's height for the first time -- something Dr. Schiller calls the \"movie star effect,\" since people aren't able to register an actor's height when they see them only on screen. </p><p>   \"When there's something surprising that you weren't expecting, then a lot of neural mechanisms become focused on acquiring new information and paying attention to that source of surprise to figure it out,\" says Dr. Schiller. \"It's all about reducing uncertainty.\" </p><p>   If the surprise is pleasant, Dr. Schiller says, the interaction is likely to be remembered more favorably. Of course, the converse is also true. </p><p>   It's impossible to be certain of what kind of first impression we're making, even before accounting for whatever biases, stereotypes and expectations the other person might harbor. But Erica Boothby, a psychologist who studies early-stage relationship development in the workplace and beyond, says a good barometer of what someone thought of us is what we thought of them. She also finds that we're overly critical of ourselves. </p><p>   \"On average, you're coming off better than you think,\" says Dr. Boothby, a postdoctoral fellow and lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. \"A lot of my research shows [that] when people meet for the first time, the other person actually likes you more than you realize.\" </p><p>   More than anything else, Dr. Schiller says, people notice what others feel -- including nerves, insecurities or stress. Her advice is to ease yourself into the situation and to be forgiving of yourself. </p><p>   \"The most convincing presentation is the one you believe in,\" she says. \"So first and foremost, be comfortable in your own skin or at least have a very good social face or a social persona that you feel comfortable in.\" </p><p>   While first impressions are by definition made quickly, Dr. Schiller says it can be beneficial to try to withhold judgment when meeting another person, and instead try to take time to collect more information. She says that in a lot of cases, people are overconfident about their ability to assess first impressions, making it hard for us to imagine alternative explanations. She also says that our assessments draw heavily on our prior experiences. </p><p>   \"If you keep making judgments based on your prior experiences without having an opportunity to update, you will remain within a very narrow line of experiences,\" she says. \"In a way, it's good to doubt yourself.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. Delmore is the host and senior producer of \"As We Work,\" a Wall Street Journal podcast about the changing workplace.
