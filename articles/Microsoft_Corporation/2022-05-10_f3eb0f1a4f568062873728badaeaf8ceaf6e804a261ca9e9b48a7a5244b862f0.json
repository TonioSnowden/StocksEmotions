  "title": "Truist Financial Acquires Gamified Fintech Startup Long Game; Deal for the San Francisco-based app maker is designed to capitalize on gaming technology that rewards users for saving money",
  "text": "<p>\"The business benefit of Long Game is acquiring new households [and] deepening relationships with existing households,\" said Truist Chief Information Officer Scott Case.</p><p>San Francisco-based Long Game had 12 bank and credit-union customers prior to the Truist acquisition, said co-founder and CEO Lindsay Holden, with users spending around 13 minutes per session and saving an average of around $60 per month, she said. Long Game has attracted \"hundreds of thousands\" of users since the company's 2015 launch, Ms. Holden said.</p><p>Ms. Holden will continue to lead the 12-person Long Game team, which will report to Mr. Case.</p><p>The deal comes as consolidation in the videogame industry continues to ride a postpandemic surge, peaking earlier this year with Microsoft Corp.'s bid to acquire gaming giant Activision Blizzard Inc. in an all-cash deal valued at $75 billion. Spending on mergers and acquisitions in gaming nearly tripled to $26.2 billion in 2021 from $8.9 billion in 2020, according to PitchBook.</p><p>Outside of the gaming industry, companies like Truist are looking to capitalize on the same interactive qualities that keep eyeballs glued to the screen for more mainline business activities.</p><p>Also known as gamification, the effort incorporates game mechanics into a task or goal, such as saving money in a checking account, in order to motivate current users and attract new ones. For banks and financial-services companies, gamification is seen as a way to attract younger users.</p><p>Gamification is an extension of what younger customers experience in the nonfinancial parts of their lives, including in entertainment and education, said Mike Foy, head of wealth intelligence at market-research firm J.D. Power.</p><p>\"Gamification obviously creates a more stickier user experience and it's going to bring people back to engage,\" he said.</p><p>A 2017 Accenture survey found that 65% of millennials said they wanted gamification to help them learn more about investing.</p><p>Truist is not the only financial company to delve into gamification. Ally Financial Inc. has rolled out interactive digital games to boost marketing and financial-education efforts, including integrations with popular games Animal Crossing and Minecraft, said Andrea Brimmer, chief marketing and public relations officer at Ally.</p><p>At Truist, the Long Game team will initially focus on the game app, but their duties could expand over time to improve user experiences on the banking app, Mr. Case said.</p><p>Long Game users earn in-app coins by meeting savings goals and answering financial literacy quizzes. The coins unlock eligibility to play games, which can yield cash rewards. Truist accounts will underpin the Long Game app since users gain in-app coins by increasing account balances.</p><p>The pattern of regular interaction through games in Long Game keeps users contributing to their savings goals, helping build deposits for the bank, said Ms. Holden, the company's CEO.</p><p>\"I am very math- and data-minded and I also really care about aesthetics and art, and I realized that designing consumer mobile experiences married these things beautifully,\" said Ms. Holden, who earlier co-founded online auction startup Innovative Auctions.</p><p>Long Game had raised $20 million and investors included Vestigo Ventures, Franklin Templeton, Thrive Capital and Collaborative Fund, Ms. Holden said.</p><p>In December 2019, BB&amp;T Corp. completed its $28.2 billion acquisition of SunTrust Banks Inc. to create Truist, the seventh largest U.S. commercial bank, according to the company. Average deposits for the first quarter of 2022 were $415.2 billion, up 8.4% compared to the same period in 2021.</p><p>Write to Suman Bhattacharyya at Suman.Bhattacharyya@wsj.com</p><p>Truist Financial Acquires Gamified Fintech Startup Long Game</p>",
