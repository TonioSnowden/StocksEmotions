  "title": "Business News: Zoom Video Sees Strong Growth --- Company expects revenue to rise more than 41% even as pandemic eases",
  "text": "<p>The sharp growth has repeatedly outpaced Zoom's own projections.</p><p>The company boosted its full-year outlook multiple times last year, and the full-year figure beat its November forecast.</p><p>Although Zoom made its name, in part, by giving its services away free to many users during the pandemic, its number of paying users also skyrocketed as large businesses and others tried to connect their workforces and customers.</p><p>Zoom ended the year with about 467,100 customers each with more than 10 employees, a nearly sixfold increase from the year earlier.</p><p>\"The future is here with the rise of remote and work-from-anywhere change. We recognize this new reality, \" Chief Executive Eric Yuan said in an earnings call.</p><p>Zoom revenue for the January quarter surged to $882.5 million from $188.3 million a year earlier.</p><p>The results beat Wall Street targets and Zoom's financial projections, driven by the shift to remote work and distance schooling amid the Covid-19 outbreak.</p><p>Shares rose 8.5% in after-hours trading.</p><p>The stock closed Monday at $409.66, up 9.7% for the day and more than tripling over the past 12 months,</p><p>Zoom's fourth-quarter profit surged to more than $260 million from $15.3 million a year earlier.</p><p>On a per-share basis, profit rose to 87 cents, or $1.22 on an adjusted basis.</p><p>Zoom has been adapting its tools to prepare for companies having some employees returning to the office and others continuing to work remotely.</p><p>Mr. Yuan said Zoom is evolving into a broader platform offering new services beyond just videoconferencing, such as webinars, chat and third-party applications. \"We're not only a video conferencing company anymore.\"</p><p>It also launched an effort to make money from smaller Zoom users.</p><p>Zoom Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg said profitability continued to be affected by the company's providing its service to more than 125,000 K-12 schools that began the new academic year largely teaching remotely and cloud-costs to facilitate all users.</p><p>But operating costs for the quarter and the full year also rose sharply as the company expanded capacity to meet growing demand, including from free accounts like school districts, which weighed on margins.</p><p>The videoconferencing company, which started trading in the public markets in 2019, has been one of the biggest corporate beneficiaries from the shift to remote work and distance schooling, pitting it against larger rivals like Microsoft Corp.</p><p>Zoom ended the year with a profit of $671.5 million on $2.65 billion in revenue, compared with $21.8 million in profit and $622.7 million in revenue a year earlier.</p><p>In the current fiscal year, it expects $3.59 to $3.65 a share in adjusted profit and $3.76 billion to $3.78 billion in revenue, ahead of analysts' projections, according to FactSet.</p>",
