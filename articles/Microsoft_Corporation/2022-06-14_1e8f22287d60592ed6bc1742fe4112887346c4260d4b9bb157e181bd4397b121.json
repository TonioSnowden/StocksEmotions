  "text": "<p>Vauhini Vara</p><p>WHEN I WAS in middle school, in the '90s, my family moved to Mercer Island, a Seattle suburb in Lake Washington. I remember finding its lush greenness almost impossibly beautiful. Before that, I'd spent most of my life in a couple of small, cold, yellowish towns in Saskatchewan, Canada. On Mercer Island, a lot of the kids at my school were bored with their surroundings; they couldn't wait to leave. But I thought of the place, all lakeshore and fern, as a dreamscape.</p><p>Decades later, I started writing a novel in which the narrator, a teenager named Athena, is being raised in the near future by her father, the tech mogul King Rao, on an otherwise uninhabited island in the Seattle area. But their home couldn't possibly be Mercer Island. My hometown was well-off in the '90s, but the tech boom has made it even more affluent—and more populous. I couldn't imagine its residents abandoning it anytime soon. Mercer Island's rising wealth is mirrored in the area's other residential islands, Bainbridge Island and Vashon Island, which sit in Puget Sound off the coast of Seattle. One day early in the pandemic, looking at Google Maps to try to figure out which island in the area might credibly be uninhabited, I noticed another one. Shaped a bit like a shark's tooth and measuring just over a mile wide, Blake Island is a lot smaller than Bainbridge, to its north, or Vashon Island, to its south. I'd seen it from West Seattle, where my mom now lived, and had idly wondered what it was. The island, I now learned, had been a campground of the Suquamish and Duwamish Tribes. Chief Seattle is believed to have been born there in the 1780s. Later, in the mid 1800s, white Seattleites logged the island for its timber.</p><p>Its most recent full-time inhabitants had been a wealthy family from Kentucky called the Trimbles—William Pitt Trimble, the patriarch, was a real-estate investor—but they had left in the 1920s after William's wife, Cannie, drowned in an accident. In 1959, the island became a state-owned park, and in recent years, Argosy Cruises, a private boat-tour operator, had been leading guided trips to the island, 4 miles from Seattle, though it wasn't a particularly popular tourist attraction. I decided Athena and King would make Blake Island their home, but first I'd have to see the island for myself.</p><p>So last summer, on a warm July morning, I boarded the boat—bringing my mom along—from a pier not far from the aquarium in downtown Seattle. We bore south, passing West Seattle's Alki Beach, with its stout red-and-white lighthouse, on the left. About a half-hour later, we arrived in front of Blake Island's replica longhouse built in 1962 to stage a tourist attraction called the Tillicum Excursion. A meal-and-show event loosely connected to Native American tradition, the modern iteration of the \"excursion\" involved dancing and holograms. We arrived too early to see the show, which was fine. The longhouse also houses a canteen that serves light refreshments, but the island's real draw is its 475 acres of little-disturbed Pacific Northwest gorgeousness. Seattle is known for its verdure, but that's under threat as the city grows: It lost 2% of its tree cover from 2007 to 2015. Blake Island, meanwhile, hasn't been logged for years and is free of major development.</p><p>With a guide, my mom and I walked along the north side of a trail that loops the entire island. Our guide lifted a frond of one of the sword ferns that flourish on the island and showed us the spores on the underside, which could be used to soothe the burn from the island's numerous stinging nettles. She showed us the bigleaf maples and red alders and explained how life thrives even in fallen trees, with fungi growing on the dead wood. She also pointed out the holly, a non-native plant; Cannie Trimble is thought to have brought it in, she said, allowing it to proliferate. It was a rare sign of human influence on the island's landscape—along with the longhouse and its offerings. Later, we ordered a glass of wine and sat outside on a bench, sharing it while we waited for the return ferry.</p><p>Not many other passengers shared the ride back to Seattle. Later that year, Argosy Cruises announced that it would no longer operate trips to Blake Island or run Tillicum Excursion, citing lost revenue due to the pandemic. It's still possible, though, to visit the island on one's own, by boat. With the dinner show having been shut down, there's little to do other than hike or bike the trails or go crabbing and clamming in summer. That's exactly what makes it worth visiting. In a region that has come to be best known for its human residents' transformation of the world—for companies like Amazon, Microsoft and the rest—Blake Island has, remarkably, managed to mostly keep us away.</p><p>Vauhini Vara, a former Wall Street Journal technology reporter, is the author of 'The Immortal King Rao.'</p><p>Seattle's Wild Side: An Island Untouched by the Tech Boom</p>",
