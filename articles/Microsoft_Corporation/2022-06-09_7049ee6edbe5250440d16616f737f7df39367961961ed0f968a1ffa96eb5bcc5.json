  "title": "Microsoft to Disclose Pay Ranges for All U.S. Job Postings; Software giant's move comes after home state adopts pay transparency law",
  "text": "<p>The move comes after its home state of Washington adopted a law earlier this year requiring such disclosures on job postings starting next year. The new rules, which apply to companies with at least 15 employees, also mandate a description of benefits and other compensation available to job candidates.</p><p>A similar law went into effect in Colorado in 2021 and other states have adopted such requirements. New York City adopted a similar measure that is expected to take effect in November.</p><p>Proponents of the laws say they are aimed at addressing gender-pay gaps and providing more transparency on pay. Some business groups have pushed back against the requirements, saying they would add a burden in a tight job market.</p><p>The plan was among several corporate initiatives that Microsoft unveiled Wednesday, including paring back its use of noncompete clauses in employment agreements with U.S. workers and hiring a third-party firm to complete a civil-rights audit of its workforce policies and practices.</p><p>Microsoft employed 181,000 people as of June 30, 2021, including 103,000 in the U.S. Its median worker was paid $177,000 last fiscal year, according to the company's latest proxy filing. Microsoft has struck a deal to acquire videogame maker Activision Blizzard Inc., which has nearly 10,000 employees.</p><p>Write to Lauren Weber at lauren.weber+1@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft to Disclose Pay Ranges for All U.S. Job Postings</p>",
