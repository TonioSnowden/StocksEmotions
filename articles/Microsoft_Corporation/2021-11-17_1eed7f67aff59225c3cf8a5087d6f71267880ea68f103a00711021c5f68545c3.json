  "text": "<p>For example, a Medicare review of healthcare-provider directories of Medicare Advantage organizations, conducted in 2016 and 2017, found that 52.2% of the locations listed had at least one inaccuracy, such as physicians who don't practice at the site. Medical practices often list a doctor as being at a location because the group has an office there, even if that physician rarely or never sees patients at that site, according to Medicare.</p><p>Founded in 2016, Ribbon aggregates physician data, such as phone numbers and insurances accepted, and uses machine learning to figure out which information is correct, said co-founder and Chief Executive Nate Maslak. This, for instance, could help a health insurer improve its directory of healthcare providers, he said.</p><p>Ribbon plans to apply this new funding to areas such as technology investment and hiring. It plans to increase its headcount to nearly 150 by the end of 2022 from 60 today, Mr. Maslak said.</p><p>And now on to the news ...</p><p>Top News</p><p>A view of State Street in downtown Boston where the Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board is based.</p><p>Co-investments. The Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board wants to double the amount of capital it commits to co-investments, where the pension invests in deals alongside its general partners, without paying them extra fees or a share of the profits, The Wall Street Journal's Preeti Singh reports.</p><p>The investment committee for Mass PRIM, as the $98.5 billion pension is known, approved a recommendation that would give the investment staff flexibility to commit up to 40% of its annual private-equity allocation to co-investments. The pace is double the 20% of annual commitments that the pension currently sets aside for such deals. The pension system's board of trustees is expected to vote on the plan in December.</p><p>Mass PRIM has allocated between $2.1 billion and $2.7 billion for new private-equity investments in 2021. So far this year through its August board meeting, the pension had committed $2.234 billion to 17 private-equity funds, the documents from the committee meeting show.</p><p>Mass PRIM joins a number of large investors that are increasing their focus on private-equity co-investments, which help them reduce costs associated with their private-equity portfolios and forge closer ties to their favorite managers. Unlike with private-equity funds, investors typically pay no fees or carried interest on co-investment deals.</p><p>$250 Million</p><p>The amount of Series B financing raised by biotechnology startup Acelyrin Inc.</p><p>AI Customer-Service Startup Netomi Raises $30 Million</p><p>Netomi Inc., a provider of customer-service chatbots, said it has raised $30 million in a Series B funding round that values the company at $210 million, up from a valuation of $67.5 million in 2019.
