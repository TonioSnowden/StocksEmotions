  "text": "<p>Going forward, Germany said it would boost annual military spending above the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's target of 2% of gross domestic product, from around 1.5% last year.</p><p>The foreign-policy shift by Mr. Scholz, a 63-year-old center-left politician who became chancellor in December, shows how Russian President Vladimir Putin's attack of Ukraine is sending shock waves throughout the continent.</p><p>The day of Russia's attack on Ukraine, Feb. 24, marked a turning point, Mr. Scholz said.</p><p>\"Putin wants to establish a Russian empire,\" Mr. Scholz said Sunday. The key question now, he said in a rare show of emotion, is \"whether we can summon the strength to set boundaries to warmongers like Putin.\"</p><p>Germany, he said, would fight to protect European democracy from Russia and defend \"every square meter\" of NATO's territory. Like all NATO countries including the U.S., Germany has said it won't intervene militarily in Ukraine. But Berlin and other Western capitals are increasingly looking to aid Ukraine by all means short of direct involvement in the fighting.</p><p>Such rhetoric hasn't been heard in the Reichstag building, the historic seat of Germany's Parliament, in the post-World War II era, according to historians. It triggered both heckling from some opposition politicians and thunderous ovations from the majority of legislators.</p><p>Mr. Scholz vowed to cut Germany's reliance on Russian energy, in a reversal of policy going back decades that enabled Berlin access to cheap energy but tied it ever-closer to Moscow. Previous governments helped build two underwater pipelines to pump natural gas directly from Russia into Germany, and Berlin currently gets more than half of its natural gas and a quarter of its oil from state-controlled Russian exporters.</p><p>Having already suspended a pipeline known as Nord Stream 2, a flagship Russo-German project that would have replaced gas pumped overland through Eastern Europe, including Ukraine, Mr. Scholz said his government would also facilitate access to liquefied natural gas, or LNG, an idea long rejected by German leaders.</p><p>Across Western Europe, governments and citizens shocked by Russia's war in Ukraine are rethinking some of their most cherished assumptions about the security of their continent.</p><p>When the Cold War ended in the apparent triumph of the Western model of liberal democracy and capitalism with a social safety net, most people in prosperous countries such as Germany believed the whole of the continent would converge with their political values.</p><p>Fears in the new democracies of Europe's ex-Communist east that Russia could reassert its claim to a sphere of influence, limiting its neighbors' independence, were viewed in the capitals of Western Europe as retrograde.</p><p>In Germany, France, Italy and elsewhere, much of the political and business elite has since the 1990s pursued a policy of engagement with Russia by seeking to deepen ties in business, diplomacy, culture, civil society and energy.</p><p>A German doctrine known as Wandel durch Handel, or change through trade, was a bet that boosting commercial ties would lead to friendly relations and keep in check the Kremlin's ambitions. That doctrine, declared in increasingly plain language in the past 15 years, helped revise Europe's geopolitical order.</p><p>Many European countries reduced their military capabilities after the Cold War, believing that a continental order based on economic interdependence had made war in the region obsolete. Germany, for example, slashed the number of main battle tanks from 5,000 in 1989 to 300 currently, while reducing its armed forces from nearly 500,000 personnel to around 180,000.</p><p>The European Union and NATO acted as guarantors of the longest period of peace and prosperity in their members' history, while West European governments touted their region's success as a model for the peaceful integration of the rest of the world.</p><p>China's increasing assertiveness in recent years has called into question Europe's faith that trade can guarantee friendly political relations.</p><p>Even Mr. Putin's invasions of Georgia in 2008 and parts of Ukraine in 2014 didn't lead to a rethink.</p><p>The Russian leader's large-scale invasion of Ukraine, an increasingly democratic and Western-oriented country, has shattered all illusions.</p><p>Central and Eastern Europeans in countries such as Poland, Estonia and the Czech Republic are now feeling vindicated that their Western neighbors have awakened to the return of history to the continent.</p><p>\"This long-term skepticism about Russia's intentions differs between countries that do have a memory of occupation and those who don't,\" said Tomas Kopecny, deputy defense minister of the Czech Republic. \"The sentiment is now on our side.\"</p><p>Mr. Kopecny said: \"Having lived through the reality of Russia's occupation in the cloak of the U.S.S.R. brand, what is happening is not surprising, it is predictable.\"</p><p>Ukraine's embassy in Prague launched on Saturday a crowdfunding campaign, working with Czech defense experts, aimed at raising money for weapons purchases. Within one hour, $250,000 had poured in from individual donors from the Czech Republic, Mr. Kopecny said.</p><p>Several other foreign embassies in Prague have offered to donate as well, he said. The Czech defense ministry will help identify the weaponry most useful to Ukraine because the two countries' militaries use similar equipment. The equipment purchased will be escorted to Ukraine in private vehicles with a police escort, Mr. Kopecny said.</p><p>On Saturday, Germany's Mr. Scholz broke with the country's previous refusal to send Ukraine weapons, promising to supply Stinger and antitank missiles.</p><p>Now, Germany is talking about a rearmament of its own forces that was unthinkable just days ago.</p><p>Germany's most senior soldier said last week the country's army needed thorough rebuilding. \"I wouldn't have believed that after 41 years of service in peacetime I would have to experience another war,\" Lt. Gen. Alfons Mais said in a statement posted on his LinkedIn profile. \"And the armed forces that I lead are more or less powerless.\"</p><p>Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Germany's defense minister until December, wrote last week on Twitter: \"I'm so angry at ourselves for our historical failure.\" Referring to Russia's repeated attacks on neighboring countries in recent years, she added that \"we have not prepared anything that would have really deterred Putin.\"</p><p>The EU, an organization born of the dream of peaceful reconciliation and economic integration, said Sunday that it would finance the purchase of weapons for Ukraine, an unprecedented step for the bloc. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called the decision \"a watershed moment.\"</p><p>The EU also added to its sanctions on Russia by banning the country's planes. \"Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane -- and that includes the private jets of oligarchs,\" Ms. von der Leyen said.</p><p>\"We are back to an age of deterrence, the way it was conceived during the Cold War -- only we have forgotten how to do it and must quickly relearn,\" said Andreas Rodder, professor of history at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.</p><p>Mr. Rodder said Western political and business elites who had operated in denial about Mr. Putin's geopolitical ambitions -- despite years of warnings from their Eastern neighbors -- should now support the change of course that Mr. Scholz was charting.</p><p>\"Putin acts within the category of Russian imperialism that has no regard for the sovereignty of lesser powers,\" Mr. Rodder said. \"He is challenging the entire European order, which is based on accepting existing borders.\"</p><p>Mr. Scholz, who has been openly skeptical about Mr. Putin's authoritarianism ever since his days as mayor of Hamburg, realized the Russian strongman was rejecting Europe's security order when he visited him in the Kremlin for the first time earlier this month, according to a senior German official.</p><p>For much of the meeting, Mr. Putin elaborated his claims that Ukraine belongs to Russia and detailed how Moscow had been consistently wronged by the West since the fall of the Iron Curtain. It was then that Mr. Scholz understood Mr. Putin was planning to expand in an imperial fashion, the German official said.</p><p>The invasion of Ukraine launched Thursday dispelled any residual doubt that Mr. Putin was prepared to use force to back his claims on foreign territory. It was then that Mr. Scholz decided a fundamental shift in Germany's, and Europe's, defense posture was needed, the official said.</p><p>Mr. Scholz made public the imminent investment of about $113 billion in new weapons systems, including Israeli drones and U.S. F-35 warplanes, to strengthen the West's ability to deter Moscow. The decision to buy F-35s is notable because Germany has long preferred European defense-industry collaboration for big-ticket defense programs.</p><p>Since Mr. Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine, Mr. Scholz's government coalition of his Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democratic Party has put an end to some entrenched policy taboos, including agreeing to send lethal weapons to Kyiv and suspending Nord Stream 2. The measures, all of which will be reflected in this year's budget, underline how profoundly Russia's attack on Ukraine is upending European politics.</p><p>\"We have to ask ourselves: What capacities does Putin's Russia have? And which capacities do we need to counter his threats?\" Mr. Scholz said to Parliament. \"It's clear we will need to invest a lot more in the security of our country to defend our freedom and our democracy.\"</p><p>For decades, Germany had managed to reconcile rising welfare expenditure with budget surpluses by constraining investment in defense and other areas, leading to what several high-ranking officers recently called a hollowing out of its armed forces.</p><p>Experts warned that the shift will be difficult and require a structural change inside the German military, the government and society.</p><p>Much of Europe and Germany in particular have for decades played down the significance of keeping strong armed forces, and recently the EU deemed the defense industry as environmentally unsustainable, in a way that could limit access to funding under new rules for the bloc, said Heiko Borchert, a defense consultant and academic.</p><p>Mr. Putin's aggression has now held up a mirror to the face of Germany, and the challenge for the government was to create a social acceptance for a radical policy shift of focusing on hard power and defense, Mr. Borchert said.</p><p>Even more than greater military spending, Germany needs a change of mind-set to match more-effective fighting capabilities with strong political will, said Erich Vad, a retired brigadier-general who was a military-policy adviser to former Chancellor Angela Merkel.</p><p>\"Russia's expenditure is marginally higher than Germany's, yet our army is a laughingstock and theirs is menacing the world,\" Gen. Vad said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
