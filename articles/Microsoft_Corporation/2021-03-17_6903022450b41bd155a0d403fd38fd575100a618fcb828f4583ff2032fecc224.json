  "text": "<h2>The next problem </h2> <p>I am a successful finance lawyer and while I can't say I didn't struggle along the way, some things I excelled at. Recently I was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD. Contrary to what I was taught (develop your weaknesses), I am now reading that I should develop my strengths. My profession does not play to my strengths, and I may need to consider a career change. How do I figure out which roles would be a good fit? <strong>Female, 40s</strong></p> <h2>Jonathan's answer</h2> <p>While your recent diagnosis may offer an explanation for the areas you've found more challenging, it appears to have unsettled you enough that you are considering a career change. Whether this is a causal or temporal association of events, you raise an excellent point about playing to strengths rather than developing weaknesses.</p> <p>The concept of the polymath, or Renaissance man — someone with exceptional knowledge — sets an impossibly high target that has endured. For example, at middle school, pupils are encouraged to develop their weaker subjects so they can present an equally good set of results across the board.</p> <p>As associate professor Janette Dinishak summarises in her research “<a href=\"https://dsq-sds.org/article/view/5236/4475\">The Deficit View and Its Critics</a>”, over the past 10 or more years, a “deficit-based” approach to understanding human differences, whether in psychology, sociology or anthropology, has been challenged. The deficit-based view considers individuals or groups in terms of their perceived deficiencies or deviations from the norm. In a strengths-based model, dyslexia and ADHD are not seen as deficiencies or weaknesses to be developed.</p> <p>As careers progress, people migrate towards and are selected for roles they excel at, in which they can build on existing strengths, skills and competencies. This seems a rational approach to improving their chances of success and enjoying the work content. If they struggle with certain aspects of a role they love, then they learn coping mechanisms. For example, lawyers have much to read and write, and dyslexia could make such tasks take longer, so they may employ text-to-speech or AI to reduce this particular element of the work.</p> <p>Before looking for a new role, it could be worth identifying your employability strengths. For you, these may include verbal communication, empathy, numeracy, problem solving, and teamwork.</p> <p>Recent annual reviews from peers and clients may hold clues to your strengths that are recognised as exceptional. How could you migrate your current role and practice to capitalise on your strengths? </p> <p>If you find verbal communication easier than written, could you develop a role in face-to-face negotiation or mediation? If you find it easier to work with numbers rather than words, could you do more in financial assessments, audits, forensic accounting? </p> <p>Be guided by asking yourself where you see yourself in five years' time; what sort of work, in what environment? Seek advice on understanding if this vision of a new or modified role would play to your strengths.</p> <h2>Reader's advice</h2> <p>Don't let your recent diagnosis redefine you . . . You must have had to work&#xa0;<em>incredibly</em>&#xa0;hard to get where you are with these twin challenges. I suspect if you put your mind to it you can do anything you want. So what do you&#xa0;<em>want&#xa0;</em>to do? <strong>TH</strong></p> <p>I think middle age is a great opportunity to rethink some of the paradigms we've been fed since childhood (such as constant self improvement, meeting someone else's expectations etc). Take care of yourself and good luck.&#xa0;<strong>Sewa</strong></p> <p>I would use your network and/or LinkedIn to speak directly to people in job roles that take your fancy.
