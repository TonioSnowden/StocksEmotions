  "text": "<p>All three indexes logged their biggest one-day point and percentage gains since June 24. They have risen more than 6% from their lows in mid-June but remain down sharply for the year.</p><p>Investors are parsing earnings reports to determine how decades-high inflation is affecting corporate profits and consumer spending. Economists have been raising the estimated chances of a U.S. recession within the next 12 months, worried that the higher interest rates put in place by the Federal Reserve to curb inflation will weigh on growth.</p><p>Some investors, though, are on the lookout for signs from executives that the economic picture might not be as dark as feared.</p><p>\"When you look at what's happening in the real economy through the lens of our customers, I'd say it's less than 50/50 that we end up with a recession at this point,\" said Bruce Van Saun, CEO of Citizens Financial Group, which reported earnings that beat expectations Tuesday.</p><p>Investors see bank earnings as a good way to determine the path of the broader economy, since their businesses closely track the health of consumers and businesses. Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan also said on the bank's earnings call earlier this week that its customers' resilience and health remain strong.</p><p>\"When we hear leaders say that inflation is under check or the general business climate is getting more hospitable, that's what markets react to positively,\" said Christopher McMahon, president and chief executive of Aquinas Wealth Advisors.</p><p>Netflix, which reported after market close, said it lost subscribers in two consecutive quarters for the first time in its history. But the streaming giant lost fewer customers than it had anticipated â€” 970,000 compared with an expected two million. Shares rose in after-hours trading.</p><p>Investors are paying close attention to comments companies make about plans to cut back on hiring or other investments. Some technology companies, including Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet's Google, have alreadyslowed hiring or cut jobs.</p><p>\"If the corporate sector starts to cut back on investment spending, that to me is the nail in the coffin,\" said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management.</p><p>Expectations for global growth and profits reached an all-time low in July, according to Tuesday's global fund manager survey from Bank of America. Meanwhile, investors' allocation to stocks is at the lowest level since October 2008, the survey found.</p><p>\"Nobody is incentivized to be optimistic right now,\" said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide Investment Management Group. \"The market is already positioned for extreme pessimism.\"</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, fell 0.5%. The declining dollar likely drove equities higher, said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial Inc.</p><p>\"It'll be a headwind if [the dollar] continues to move higher,\" Mr. Saglimbene said.</p><p>The dollar has surged against other currencies this year as investors shelter from falling stocks and bet on U.S. economic resilience. The euro, which hit parity with the dollar last week, rose 0.8% to $1.0227.</p><p>In company news, shares of International Business Machines fell $7.25, or 5.3%, to $130.88 after the technology company said shutting down its Russia operations and a strong dollar weighed on its quarterly results. Shares of Lockheed Martin gained $3.10, or 0.8%, to $390.38 after the aerospace and defense contractor reported results that missed analysts' profit and sales estimates.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson shares lost $2.54, or 1.5%, reversing earlier gains to close at $171.69. The pharmaceutical and consumer health products company reported a profit and sales that beat expectations but reduced its earnings outlook for the year on Tuesday. Shares of Halliburton rose 61 cents, or 2.1%, to $29.46 after the oil services company beat profit and revenue expectations.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 3.017% from 2.959% Monday. Yields and prices move inversely. And in energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 1% to $107.35 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gained 1.4%.</p><p>The European Central Bank is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in 11 years at its meeting Thursday. Typically, interest-rate increases cause currencies to strengthen because investors are paid more to invest in those assets.</p><p>Officials are expected to discuss raising interest rates by half a percentage point, The Wall Street Journal reported. Economists, though, still expect a quarter-percentage-point increase, in line with what ECB President Christine Legarde has signaled.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes were mixed. China's Shanghai Composite was flat, South Korea's Kospi edged down 0.2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.9%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Orla McCaffrey at orla.mccaffrey@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Jumps 750 Points as Investors Take Hope From Earnings Reports</p>",
