  "text": "<p><strong>Gavin Houghton Miss Leigh the Pot Head, £390<br></strong>This Leigh Bowery-inspired “pot head” by interior designer turned ceramist Gavin Houghton is just the thing for stowing wooden spoons and spatulas. It also doubles as a vase. Leigh would be so proud.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.gavinhoughton.co.uk/product-page/miss-leigh-the-pot-head/\"><em>gavinhoughton.co.uk</em></a></p> <p><strong>Fredericks and Mae chopping boards, from £32<br></strong>Chopping blocks that&#xa0;will upstage everything else in your kitchen. Made from professional-grade plastic, these boards come in a range of Memphis Group colours,&#xa0;different sizes and shapes.&#xa0;Cutting edge. <a href=\"https://fredericksandmae.com/collections/cutting-boards\"><em>fredericksandmae.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Reserva Catalina Cantabrian anchovies, £18<br></strong>Ever since Spanish chef José Pizarro fed me these sublimely mellow anchovies (which are salted for two years), I have craved some on an almost daily basis. The&#xa0;truffle of tinned anchovies.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://shop.josepizarro.com/products/cantabrian-anchovies-reserva-catalina?_pos=1&amp;_sid=099b11374&amp;_ss=r\"><em>shop.josepizarro.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Antoinette incense holder, €102<br></strong>At a lunch recently, I saw two of these incense holders by Paris artisanal workshop Astier de Villatte being used as salt and pepper dishes: a&#xa0;heap of poivre and sel next to&#xa0;Marie Antoinette's toppled ceramic head. A statement.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.astierdevillatte.com/product/241/antoinette-incense-holder?v=241\"><em>astierdevillatte.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Fiasconaro panettone, £43<br></strong>This panettone with Sicilian citrus fruits and saffron, courtesy of Dolce &amp; Gabbana and pastry company Fiasconaro, would be perfect eaten fresh, turned into pain perdu&#xa0;or layered in a creamy bread and butter pudding.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.dolcegabbana.com/en/collection-2/panettone-with-sicilian-citrus-fruits-and-saffron-yellow-PN1000YEL2082000.html\"><em>dolcegabbana.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Inkbird IHT-1P instant-read thermometer, £23.99<br></strong>The only piece of tech gadgetry on my wishlist is this instant-read thermometer by Inkbird, which also&#xa0;produces multi-probe BBQ thermometers, hygrometers (to measure humidity) and sous-vide cookers that wouldn't look out of&#xa0;place in A&amp;E.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://uk.inkbird.com/collections/food-thermometer/products/iht-1p\"><em>uk.inkbird.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Ocelot chocolate bars, £22 a month subscription<br></strong>I'm a sucker for great chocolate packaging. And for great chocolate. So I'd love&#xa0;a subscription to Edinburgh-based chocolatier Ocelot Chocolate. I particularly rate its “Femme” dark milk made from Amelonado cocoa beans grown by women in east Congo (the world's first female cocoa collective). <a href=\"https://ocelotchocolate.com/shop/subscription\"><em>ocelotchocolate.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>JW Anderson aubergine key fob, £145<br></strong>A key fob&#xa0;in the shape of an aubergine. I&#xa0;didn't know that I wanted one&#xa0;until I wanted one. JW Anderson also produces a peach version.&#xa0;How&#xa0;cheeky. <a href=\"https://www.mrporter.com/en-gb/mens/product/jw-anderson/accessories/keyrings/aubergine-leather-key-fob/13452677150308284\"><em>mrporter.com</em></a></p> <p><em><strong>Modernist Pizza</strong></em><strong>, £325<br></strong>This definitive, 1,708-page, three-volume guide on pizza from the team that brought us <em>Modernist Cuisine</em> and <em>Modernist Bread</em> (including Microsoft's former chief technology officer Nathan Myhrvold) will tell you everything you need to know about dough and toppings. Just the kind of <em>Mastermind</em>-specialist-topic nerd-fest that I love. <a href=\"https://modernistcuisineshop.com/products/modernist-pizza\"><em>modernistcuisineshop.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>White Mausu peanut rayu, six&#xa0;jars for €36<br></strong>A recent discovery, this sweet/spicy/nutty sauce joins&#xa0;my extensive cache of condiments and works beautifully on everything from eggs to steamed rice to avocado on toast. <a href=\"https://www.whitemausu.com/products/rayu-heavy\"><em>whitemausu.com</em></a>&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Ondine Platine Skillet, £395<br></strong>With its solid-brass handle and 316Ti titanium stainless steel,&#xa0;an Ondine pan is a thing of refined beauty and functionality. The brand is the brainchild of Marie Ondine Guerlain, a sixth-generation member of the perfume&#xa0;and cosmetics dynasty, so what do you expect?&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ondine.com/shop/platine-skillet-24cm\"><em>ondine.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Alessi The Strongman Nutcracker, £1,000<br></strong>I&#xa0;love cracking my own walnuts. And this limited-edition “table&#xa0;sculpture” by Marcel Wanders&#xa0;would be my ideal cracker&#xa0;of&#xa0;choice.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.harrods.com/en-gb/shopping/alessi-the-strongman-nutcracker-14803375\"><em>harrods.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Lobmeyr pitcher, £500<br></strong>On a visit to the new Bonadea store in Belgravia (an emporium of jaw-dropping exquisiteness), this handpainted Chinese pitcher by Lobmeyr caught my eye. I'd be scared of&#xa0;dropping it after my fourth round of cocktails, but as jugs go&#xa0;this is a beauty.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.bonadea.com/collections/decanters-carafes-pitchers/products/handpainted-chinese-pitcher\"><em>bonadea.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Print Tailors spice jars with cork lids and labels, set of six for £12<br></strong>Thanks to Instagram, I'm in a&#xa0;constant state of pantry envy. These well-appointed spice jars&#xa0;with cork lids and custom labels will restore my faith in my own larder cupboard.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.printtailors.com/product-page/spice-jars-with-cork-lids-set-of-6-with-labels\"><em>printtailors.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Sittingsuits Artist Edition #1: Orange Dog, £221<br></strong>Eating alfresco is always fun. But not always practical. Which is why I want one&#xa0;of these Danish sitting suits for the colder months. This is&#xa0;what happens when a duffel coat mates with a duvet. The apotheosis of comfort.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sittingsuits.com/collections/all/products/orange-dog\"><em>sittingsuits.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Clement Knives chef's knives, from £200<br></strong>These knives from British knifesmith Tim Westley are made with a zero-waste ethos, using reclaimed steel and in-house recycled plastic. All of them are now forged using discarded nitrous oxide canisters collected from around Hackney Wick.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.clementknives.com/collections/all\"><em>clementknives.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Ajesh Patalay 2021 '16 fabulous Christmas presents for foodies&#xa0;' FT.com 10 November.
