  "text": "<p>Brooke Masters paints a familiar picture of emerging healthcare data services being subjected to free market forces (“AI prompts a rush for healthcare data”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/376a5494-7237-4ed6-a528-5e45712c148d\">Opinion</a>, June 3) with big players like Google utilising their tremendous clout and potentially “amassing outsized positions”.</p> <p>The symptoms are well rehearsed — big player dominance through “gated kingdoms”, “non-standard formats”, privacy issues in particular “sensitive personal data” and small market players (in this case NHS Digital) obliged to play by rules set by the big boys. How can the UK possibly get a better deal?</p> <p>Well, healthcare could follow the example of UK retail banking with the Open Banking initiative. The power of big banks (HSBC, Lloyds, Barclays, Santander) has been subordinated to open standards, set and regulated by the Bank of England. So, how does this work?</p> <p>Standards upend free market dynamics because they “change the locus of competition” that brings substantial benefit to consumers. </p> <p>This is the verdict of Carl Shapiro and Hal Varian in their seminal book <em>Information Rules</em>. </p> <p>Specifically, instead of competing to dominate a market, big players must compete within a market that is regulated — think 3G or 4G for electronic communication worldwide. </p> <p>Unfettered big player dominance comes via market acceptance of a de facto standard, eg Microsoft and the proprietary Windows operating system. </p> <p>By contrast, de jure standards are set by regulators and trump market-driven standards.</p> <p>Where the Bank of England goes, there is no reason why the NHS may not follow. Rather than achieving a single profitable transaction for NHS Digital, the UK has a window of opportunity to establish a regulated market for healthcare data services, including General Data Protection Regulation, like retail banking before it. This has the added benefit of inducing a vibrant ecosystem of AI service companies exploiting evolving business opportunities, with the NHS at its epicentre. </p> <p><strong>Neil Scott McPhater</strong> <br><em>Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Healthcare can take a leaf out of banking's book' FT.com 7 June.
