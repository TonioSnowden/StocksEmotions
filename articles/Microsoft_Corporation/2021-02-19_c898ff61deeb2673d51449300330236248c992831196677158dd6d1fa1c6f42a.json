  "text": "<p>\n  Look, it's totally normal. Totally, absolutely normal to find yourself in the bathroom, an AirPod in one ear, listening to a live conversation on Clubhouse about the future of artificial intelligence. </p><p>\n  Totally normal for not-normal times, that is. </p><p>\n  I give you this glimpse into my thrilling life because it illustrates a few reasons live, audio-only social-media venues, particularly Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, have everyone talking right now: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- It's dead simple to join a conversation from . . . anywhere. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- It's all microphone; no camera, no worrying about your hair or color-coded bookshelf background. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  -- It's a great, serendipitous connection tool. And  after almost a year without travel or in-person conferences, I'd be excited to network with a goldfish. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The spoken-word social revolution has arrived at just the right time. And even if it turns out to be a pandemic-boosted fad, it's one you should try out. </p><p>\n  There's already something for most people. Think talk radio, podcasting, conferences, LinkedIn and Twitter all thrown in a NutriBullet. Beyond the monologues and dialogues featuring experts and well-known personalities (Elon! Oprah! Drake!), there are up-and-coming comedians and musicians performing sets and small gatherings of people who share common interests. </p><p>\n  Drawing the most attention is Clubhouse, a live and ephemeral iPhone-only, invite-only app that launched last March. Downloads of the app have exceeded eight million since launch, with 2.6 million in the U.S, according to App Annie Intelligence. </p><p>\n  Then there's Twitter's Clubhouse clone, Spaces, which is in testing now and will launch to everyone before the end of the year. </p><p>\n  I went on a journey deep into Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, to talk to the people in them and find out what the platforms are really for. Here's what I discovered: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  It's always-on, ambient social media. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Feed-based social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok demand your fingers to scroll and your eyes to read, look and watch. Social audio? It only takes your ears. And once you're listening, you can tuck your phone away and get back to driving, walking your dog or unloading your dishwasher. </p><p>\n  Think of the Clubhouse app like a big building full of different rooms with virtual stages. Walk -- OK fine, scroll -- down the main hallway and you see all the open rooms. They're recommended based on whom you follow and what areas of interest you've identified. Tap into one and you automatically start hearing what's going on in there. </p><p>\n  It's all live, too. There's no built-in recording or deferred playback. </p><p>\n  Twitter's Spaces works similarly. If one of the people you follow has launched a space, it will appear in a purple bubble along the top row in the Twitter iPhone app. (Both Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces are due on Android soon.) </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  It's a networking tool. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  If you're in a chatty mood, keep your phone handy. In Clubhouse, when you're in a room, you can tap the hand emoji button to raise your hand. If called on, you can ask a question or add some brilliant, earth-shattering point. On Twitter, you can tap the microphone icon to request to speak. For both, the room's moderators decide who can, and can't, talk. </p><p>\n  You can also start a room of your own. In Clubhouse, you can name rooms to signal your topic. Many rooms are centered around different industries -- tech, media, finance, crypto, entertainment, medicine, real estate, etc. </p><p>\n  One group called Cafe Bitcoin has various rooms open seven days a week, up to 24 hours a day, to discuss . . . yes, bitcoin. Cory Klippsten, CEO of SwanBitcoin.com, founded the group and says he averages 30 hours a week on the app now. </p><p>\n  I started a few rooms of my own over the past few weeks. The topic of discussion? Clubhouse and social audio, of course. </p><p>\n  Within minutes, people filed in and began raising their hands. Some were individuals with just a handful of followers. Others had armies of fans. At one of my events, celebrity blogger Perez Hilton popped in to share his thoughts. In most cases, as soon as the room was over, I'd have notes from people on Twitter or LinkedIn, looking to connect or exchange information. </p><p>\n  On Twitter, your space is more pegged to you: When it's open, your followers can come in, though only up to 10 can be selected to speak. In a release coming next week, Twitter will allow you to name the topic of the space; you can also pin tweets to the top of the discussion. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  It's good entertainment. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Can Clubhouse often feel like \"Shark Tank\" meets speed networking? Sure, but there are also some pockets for fun. </p><p>\n  Comedian and voice actor Matthew Friend and some of his peers do hilarious character impersonations in comedy and improv rooms. Musicians turn up in rooms, too. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  It's a work in progress. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Was I surprised to find that Clubhouse hoovered up my phone's contacts? Nope. Granted I did give the app permission to access my contacts -- it forces you if you want to see your friends on the app or invite others -- but I didn't realize they would be stored on its servers and used to notify me every time a random acquaintance signs up. Or worse, tell me that my therapist has two friends on the platform. </p><p>\n  Currently, there is no way to delete contacts from Clubhouse's servers. A company spokeswoman says the company will be adding the ability to delete contacts directly from the app soon. </p><p>\n  The brand-new-social-media-app stumbles are all too familiar at this point. Clubhouse co-founders Paul Davison and Rohan Seth address a lot of their dozen-person startup's growing pains in a regular Sunday morning town hall on the platform. It's nice to see the transparency, but it still feels like, even after a decade of social-media scandals, user privacy and security is an afterthought. </p><p>\n  And then there's the issue of content moderation, which is much harder in live audio. Clubhouse and Twitter both provide moderation tools that allow users and room moderators to block or report bad actors. Both have community guidelines, which include a zero-tolerance policy for racism, hate speech, abuse and more. The issue, like all other platforms, is enforcement. </p><p>\n  Every app is a work in progress, but these two really feel like they're being built in front of our eyes. </p><p></p>",
