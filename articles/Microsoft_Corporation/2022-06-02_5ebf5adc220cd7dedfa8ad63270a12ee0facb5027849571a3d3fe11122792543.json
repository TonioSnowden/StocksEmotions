  "title": "Microsoft Says It Is Ready to Work With Labor Unions; Software firm is trying to close deal to buy Activision Blizzard, which is facing a unionization push",
  "text": "<p>\"Recent unionization campaigns across the country—including in the tech sector have led us to conclude that inevitably these issues will touch on more businesses, potentially including our own,\" Mr. Smith wrote.</p><p>Thursday's post was Mr. Smith's latest attempt to publicly carve out a position for Microsoft on a sensitive subject that is distinct from other tech companies. He has made similar moves on other issues, such as speaking out against Apple Inc.'s closed app-store policies and backing efforts to get Facebook and Google to pay for news. Executives at other tech companies have privately and sometimes publicly fumed about Microsoft's positioning on these issues.</p><p>U.S. tech giants have long avoided unions. Microsoft reported a global workforce of roughly 181,000 as of June 2021. None are currently unionized in the U.S.</p><p>But a wave of unionization efforts across the U.S. in recent years has hit some tech companies, particularly Amazon.com Inc. and Apple, which have large hourly-worker employee bases at warehouses and stores.</p><p>Mr. Smith's statement comes as Microsoft is working to close its planned acquisition of videogames company Activision Blizzard Inc., which is also facing a unionization push. Last month, a small number of employees at an Activision studio voted in favor of unionizing with the Communications Workers of America.</p><p>The $75 billion agreement to acquire Activision is Microsoft's largest deal to date, and the companies have said they expect the transaction to close by the middle of 2023 if the deal gets approval from regulators.</p><p>After the Activision employees' union vote, Microsoft said it wouldn't stand in the way if Activision recognizes a union. \"Microsoft respects Activision Blizzard employees' right to choose whether to be represented by a labor organization and we will honor those decisions,\" a Microsoft spokesman said at the time.</p><p>From Tailors to Starbucks Baristas: Tracking America's Labor Movement</p><p>Unions fought for 40-hour workweeks and other staples of modern work culture before losing much of their clout</p><p>In making the commitment on Thursday to working closely with unions, Microsoft might be trying to differentiate itself from its fellow tech giants.</p><p>Amazon has been contesting unionization attempts at several of its warehouses for more than a year. Workers at one of its Staten Island facilities— which employs thousands of people in New York City who help prepare and ship Amazon packages—voted earlier this year to unionize. Others at an Alabama warehouse voted against unionization last year, and during a revote in March the contest was too close to call. In meetings with workers, the company has pointed to its pay and benefits and asserted that unionization was unnecessary.</p><p>Workers at several Apple retail locations have also declared their intent to vote on unionization, including in New York state, Georgia and Maryland. A group of workers in Georgia recently withdrew an election petition that was set to begin Thursday, according to the National Labor Relations Board. Apple recently boosted pay for hourly workers in the U.S. to $22 an hour, or higher depending on the market, a 45% increase from 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.</p><p>Apple and Amazon didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>\"We recognize that the right approach for Microsoft may be different from what will work best for others,\" Mr. Smith wrote in his blog post about working with labor unions.</p><p>Write to Aaron Tilley at aaron.tilley@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft Says It Is Ready to Work With Labor Unions</p>",
