In the March quarter the company posted its first loss of subscribers in more than a decade.</p><p>\"Microsoft has the proven ability to support all our advertising needs,\" Netflix Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters said in a statement. \"More importantly, Microsoft offered the flexibility to innovate over time on both the technology and sales side, as well as strong privacy protections for our members.\"</p><p>Netflix has had discussions with other potential advertising partners including Comcast Corp. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, and is hunting for an executive to spearhead the creation of the ad-supported tier, The Wall Street Journal has reported.</p><p>\"It's very early days and we have much to work through. But our long term goal is clear.
