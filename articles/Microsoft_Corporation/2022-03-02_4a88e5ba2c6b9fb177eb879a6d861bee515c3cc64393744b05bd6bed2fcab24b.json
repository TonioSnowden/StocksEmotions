  "text": "<p>Like several of its competitors, Starship's robots resemble small four-wheeled beer coolers that mostly roll along walkways to deliver food. The bots use technology similar to that in self-driving cars that deliver food packed in their cargo hold.</p><p>In January, Starship said it received $57 million in financing from the European Investment Bank, the funding arm of the European Union. On Tuesday, the startup said it raised another $42 million in a Series B funding round led by the Japanese-Nordic venture firm NordicNinja and Estonian investment firm Taavet+Sten.</p><p>Though Starship is now based in San Francisco, it was founded in Estonia and maintains a research and development facility there.</p><p>The new money will help Starship launch its service in five new European cities and on more than 10 U.S. college campuses, including North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro and South Dakota State University in Brookings.</p><p>Starship operates at over a dozen university campuses in the U.S. and small cities in both the U.S. and Europe.</p><p>Starship's capital raise comes as so-called last-mile delivery companies are jockeying for market share and searching for ways to become profitable. In New York City, for instance, venture-fueled startups—that rely on human delivery—are offering steep discounts in an attempt to win over users.</p><p>Starship is hoping its robots will allow it to cut costs enough to post a profit. Though the company as a whole isn't yet profitable, said Henry Harris-Burland, the company's vice president of marketing, some of its operations are in the black.</p><p>\"Fundamentally, we believe that fast, short-distance, low-basket-value deliveries cannot be done economically by people on a consistent basis,\" said Ahti Heinla, a Starship co-founder and its chief technology officer. Mr. Heinla, who is Estonian, also co-founded Skype.</p><p>While Starship intends to eventually enter major city centers, it has so far focused on suburbs and campuses because the costs associated with last-mile delivery are higher there than in big cities; that allows Starship to offer customers a cheaper option, Mr. Heinla said.</p><p>Operating in dense cities also present autonomous vehicles with a greater number of complicated scenarios. Even in the lesser trafficked areas the company now operates, road and railroad crossings and unpredictable obstacles can stymie the robots. Some of them, Starship's as well as those of other services, occasionally get stuck en route.</p><p>Starship's four-wheeled robots use a combination of cameras, radar and sensors to deliver food from partner restaurants to customers. Customers place orders via Starship's app and pay a delivery fee. A person then packs the order into the robot, which rolls away at a walking pace to its destination.</p><p>Starship said it tripled the number of deliveries it made last year and operates a fleet of more than 1,700 robots daily.</p><p>The EIB financing was facilitated via a venture loan and will be used for research and development, as well as to build thousands more robots at Starship's engineering facility in Estonia.</p><p>In 2019, Starship raised a $40 million Series A round from investors including Morpheus Ventures, Shasta Ventures, Matrix Partners, TDK Ventures and Qu Ventures.</p><p>Starship has raised roughly $202 million since its founding in 2014.</p><p>Write to Marc Vartabedian at marc.vartabedian@wsj.com</p>",
