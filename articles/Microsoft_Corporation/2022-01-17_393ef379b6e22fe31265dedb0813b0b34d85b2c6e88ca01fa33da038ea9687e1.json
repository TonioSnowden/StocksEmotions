  "text": "<p>Editor in Chief Matt Murray says, \"I notice many of our nut grafs these days are built around 'supposed to'—something was supposed to happen and it didn't. That's often a weak foundation for a nut graf. They tend to be straw men, in other words. We should build many fewer stories around what was 'supposed' to happen but didn't, and instead just write about what happened.\"</p><p>S&amp;S in 2020 cautioned that our nut grafs fell back too often on another, similar phrase: \"shows that\"—the familiar wording of The [INSERT TOPIC] shows that…. But we have been better more recently with that. Instead of saying in a nut graf, The merger shows how the pandemic has reshaped priorities for pie makers and cake makers, we are more likely now to just write, The pandemic has reshaped priorities for pie and cake makers.</p><p>Weather report</p><p>The Journal is known for its colorful writing, more than one might expect from a publication named after a financial district.</p><p>However, we can overdo it in the interest of drama. We have often cautioned not to use plunge for relatively minor declines in stock prices, for example (it's better to use a sober verb and a specific description of the decline, such as a percentage).</p><p>The same goes with weather. All of us, when putting on our weather-writer caps, seem to reach for severe, powerful, ferocious when describing storms. They all seem to be fast-moving. And now we can even call some of them bomb cyclones!</p><p>Perhaps the concern about climate change causes us to overdo it when describing a specific instance of \"extreme\" weather. But just as with markets and the economy, or any other subject area where statistics are available, it is better to let the facts tell the story, rather than the adjectives. As always, be sober but clear.</p><p>Rulings &amp; reminders</p><p>* BinaxNow is Abbott Laboratories' Covid self-test. We don't use the BinaxNOW capping, under our style rules against multiple-letter capping that is done only for effect.</p><p>* Enough \"already\"! An editor points out that we often use already unnecessarily. Such as: Companies have already been spending heavily on this or that. Drop the word, and if it reads just as well, keep it dropped.</p><p>* We've updated the stylebook entry on references to ages, to acknowledge that years old isn't always needed on first reference, if the meaning is clear. For example, The boy, 5, who is in kindergarten, said…. However, keep the years old if there is any doubt as to meaning. (As the book already said, years old generally isn't needed for subsequent ages in each article. And mention a person's age only if relevant to the subject matter.)</p><p>* Reminder not to add an \"s\" to possessives of company names that end in plural words. Two wrong examples recently: ROFR Holdings's and Electronic Arts's.</p><p>* Hinky? The adjective is slang, and was used in a straight news article to mean problematic. One reader wrote in to say, \"I don't subscribe to the Journal with the hope of seeing idiotic neologisms on the front page. Stop it, please.\" Well, while we hesitate to discourage bright writing, slang will always annoy some readers in what is presented as a hard-news article.</p><p>* The Dutch healthcare giant is Royal Philips NV, a translation of what is known in the home country as Koninklijke Philips.</p><p>Incentivization, continued</p><p>We are still using the hackneyed incentivize, which is best left to business jargon.</p><p>Some recent examples:</p><p>* …incentivize the purchase of union-made electric vehicles.</p><p>* …incentivize players to get vaccinated.</p><p>* …constraints that disincentivize spending on players…</p><p>* …incentivize people to keep their money in the lira.</p><p>* …incentivizing deals to get done before then.</p><p>Better choices are words like encourage, motivate or motivating, discourage, inspire, prompt, cause. (Our Tansa spell-checker will catch uses of incentivize and related words and suggests a change.)</p><p>Heads above the rest</p><p>* \"Spider-Man Stands Out as Lone Hero of Box Office,\" by Jon Blackwell.</p><p>* \"Fans of BTS Boo the Idea for NFTs,\" by Lisa Vickery.</p><p>* \"Omicron Threatens to Spoil IPO Parties,\" by Nate Becker and Aaron Lucchetti.</p><p>* \"Private-Equity Classic TPG Might Still Have Some Fizz,\" by Telis Demos.</p><p>Heads that make you go 'hmmm'</p><p>* \"Albertson's same-store sales.\" We meant Albertsons'. We point out this apostrophe-placement misfire on a label head because it is a common danger with plural or plural-looking names such as Albertsons.</p><p>Accounting fun</p><p>What's the AICPA? For a long time, it was the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. But a few years ago, it merged with another group, and the umbrella organization is the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants. So, which one takes the acronym now?</p><p>The accountants group tells us that AICPA is generally used for tax issues that are U.S.-specific, and Association (which would be lowercase in our style) for more-global issues/priorities. But they don't mind if we use AICPA for either one.</p><p>For our money, it's still probably best to reserve AICPA for the U.S. organization, and the association for second references to the international organization.</p><p>Quiz (find the flubs)</p><p>* Microsoft Corp. has also taken stakes in several startups as part of deals that entail them using its cloud.</p><p>* Tarah MacGregor, 29, in August posted in a group called Wedding Hashtag Experts offering $15 to whomever could provide the best hashtag before her engagement party a few months out.</p><p>* The total return on European stocks was almost on level pegging with that on U.S. stocks in local-currency terms.</p><p>* One day while swimming laps, the coach's whistle blew.</p><p>* In thinking about this I hearken back to James Agee's little masterpiece, \"A Death in the Family,\" a novel published posthumously in 1957.</p><p>Answers</p><p>* Entail their using its cloud.</p><p>* Whoever, that is. We and others often \"overcorrect\" a correctly written who or whoever, changing it to a whom or a whomever. (Using the they/them trick, in this case \"they\" are doing something, so the choice is whoever.)</p><p>* Blimey! As noted before, such British terms as \"level pegging\" don't work for an American news outlet.</p><p>* A dangler. Have you ever seen a whistle swim?</p><p>* Hark back is preferred.</p><p>RIP, Terry Teachout </p><p>Terry Teachout</p><p>The Wall Street Journal's drama critic, Terry Teachout, died on Thursday at age 65. We all will miss his wonderful writing. But we also had him on our VIP list at Style &amp; Substance after he tweeted this in 2016, with typical Teachout exuberance, after seeing a tweet about our latest S&amp;S issue (and specifically, an item on the overuse of the word historic): \"Is this actually e-mailed out? If so, WHY THE HELL AM I NOT GETTING IT?\"</p><p>We happily let Terry know how to find S&amp;S online.</p><p>Terry also won two \"Heads Above the Rest\" in S&amp;S, for headlines he wrote for his columns: \"Woke-lahoma!\" to describe an updated \"Oklahoma!\" musical in 2019, and \"Worst Side Story,\" for a Broadway revival of the musical in 2020.</p><p>Send questions or comments to William Power and Jennifer Hicks.
