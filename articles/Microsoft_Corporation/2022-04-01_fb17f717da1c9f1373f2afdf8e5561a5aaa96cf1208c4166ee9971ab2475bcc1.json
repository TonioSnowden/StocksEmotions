  "text": "<p>There are many ways Ukrainians are battling Russian aggression (“How to puncture Russia's disinformation bubble”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c29fab4f-d386-406d-a5c1-e6119c7a9177\">FT View</a>, March 14). </p> <p>While my family and I have had to leave our home in Irpin, a suburb of Kyiv, I still have a chance to work, pay salaries to my employees and pay taxes to support our army. I have also decided to be active on LinkedIn, where I have thousands of contacts across the whole world.</p> <p>In my LinkedIn posts, I have been focusing on the truth, although, that truth does not necessarily sound nice to Russians and those who support them. In particular, I have been vocal about Russian society's responsibility for the war, and the responsibility of ordinary Russians to influence their own army to wage war in accordance with international rules. I have also been vocal about the similarities of Vladimir Putin's regime with that of Hitler's Nazi Germany.</p> <p>However, it appears that LinkedIn was not happy with my activity. After a post, which featured a cartoon of a Ukrainian soldier cradling a baby, and a Russian conscript pillaging food off locals, LinkedIn decided to restrict my account completely, arguing that my behaviour was in breach of their terms of service.</p> <p>Russians have “restricted” me and my family from our home (like millions of Ukrainians), while LinkedIn has restricted me from my LinkedIn account, which I have had for about 15 years. Is there any difference between Russians and LinkedIn?</p> <p>We are talking about LinkedIn, the social network which is prohibited in Russia and which is a US company and part of Microsoft. While the global business world has become so much focused on environmental, social and governance issues, I just wonder which part of that “environmental, social and governance” rubric was LinkedIn following in my case?</p> <p>I fully appreciate my situation is very minor, compared to all the difficulties that other people in Ukraine are going through. I am looking more from the point of view of how important global companies, such as media companies, are applying the freedom of speech principle which may not necessarily appear — at first glance — as a business value.</p> <p><strong>Taras Dumych</strong> <br><em>Partner, Wolf Theiss — Attorneys-at-Law<br>Kyiv, Ukraine</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Is LinkedIn's ban on a Ukrainian's posts a threat to free speech?'
