Apple's quarterly net margin, operating margin and gross margin for the holiday quarter were all at their highest levels over the past 20 quarters. The highs for the three profit margins over the past 40 quarters were all in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, which ended Dec. 25, 2012.</p><p>Some notes about the profit margins and the results:</p><p>A company's net margin is its net income divided by sales. Over the past 10 years, Apple's quarterly net margin has only exceeded 27% during the most recent quarter and during the first quarter of fiscal 2013.</p><p>The operating margin is, essentially, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) divided by sales. For Apple, the holiday quarter was the first with an operating margin above 35% since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.</p><p>A company's gross margin is sales, less the cost of goods sold, divided by sales. It is higher than operating margin, because it excludes overhead not related to producing or selling products or services. It also gives an indication of pricing power — a declining gross margin while sales are increasing might indicate a company is lowering prices or offering more discounts to defend its market share. A widening gross margin as sales increase is a good sign. Apple's gross margin has now exceeded 40% for five straight quarters. Looking further back, the margin hadn't exceeded 40% since the third quarter of fiscal 2012.</p><p>Don't miss:24 software stocks, including Microsoft, expected to rise by double digits over the next year</p>",
