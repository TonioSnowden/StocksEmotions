  "text": "<p>As chair of the 30% Club and the City Women's Network, Brenda Trenowden spearheaded efforts to improve diversity and gender balance in the workplace. </p> <p>Trenowden, who has died aged 55, held that her early experience in banking fed her desire for change. Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1967, she moved from Canada to the UK in 1991, and also worked in Hong Kong, Singapore and Bangladesh, as a broker, trader and in equities research. In a 2015 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b374e64-5de6-11e5-9846-de406ccb37f2\">interview</a>, she described the financial services working environment she entered 30 years ago:</p> <p>“Everyone got in at quarter to seven, the Gitanes [cigarettes] came out and you just lived in a fog . . . I couldn't comment on some of the things that went on, but that was all condoned as normal business, whether it was the drinking or the strip clubs.”</p> <p>Trenowden's professional life over the next three decades was defined not just by increasingly senior roles at global financial institutions, but by her passionate campaigning for greater equity in the corporate world.</p> <p>Her final job in banking, after stints at Peregrine, Citi, BNY Mellon, Lloyds Banking Group and BNP Paribas, was at ANZ Banking Group, where she was Head of Financial Institutions, Europe, and sat on the UK management board. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/cd2f2724-45b9-361e-9e58-3f09d332652e\">Trenowden</a> left ANZ in 2019, joining PwC as a partner in their diversity and inclusion practice.</p> <p>She was an adviser to the UK Government's Hampton-Alexander review that aimed to increase the number of women in senior positions in FTSE 350 companies, and became chair of the 30% Club in 2015. Under her leadership, the organisation's goal of 30 per cent female representation on FTSE 100 corporate boards was achieved, up from 12.5 per cent at the organisation's founding in 2010. The 30% Club pursued a strategy of influencing and persuading, rather than establishing compulsory targets, and worked with the UK's largest listed companies to change the narrative of gender balance being seen as a “women's issue”, to it being acknowledged as a business priority that all boards had to take seriously. </p> <p>Trenowden oversaw the establishment of a new goal of 30 per cent representation of women on FTSE 350 boards as well as an increased focus on broader diversity goals, such as LGBT inclusion, and the launch of sister organisations in countries including the US, Southern Africa, and Australia. </p> <p>Trenowden's campaigning success has been attributed in part to her intensely collaborative style. Boundlessly energetic, she mentored many, and emphasised the importance not just of campaigning for change but of enjoying the process. She was, say friends, never averse to interrupting work for a spontaneous dance around the kitchen. </p> <p>She was also the senior independent director of the England and Wales Cricket Board, a role she loved not just because of the opportunities it presented to improve access to the game, but because it was a passion shared with her husband, Mark. In 2018, she was awarded a CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for services to the financial sector and gender equality. </p> <p>In her past six years, Trenowden experienced a rare form of cancer, pseudomyxoma peritonei, and the series of debilitating operations that came with it. She prepared for her first major surgery with her usual military precision, getting up at 5.30am with a friend to go running at Knole, Vita Sackville-West's former home, near her house in Sevenoaks, where she lived with Mark, her two children and the family's beloved dog. On her numerous admissions to hospital, she took with her a life-size cardboard cut-out of Hillary Clinton, whom she enormously admired.</p> <p>Trenowden was deeply frustrated by how much the disease curtailed her professional life. She took full advantage of Zoom while ill, gave interviews on the UK gender pay gap while hooked up to chemotherapy ports, and worked right until the end.</p> <p>In an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70e92e3c-e38b-11e8-a6e5-792428919cee\">interview</a> in 2018, she explained the effect cancer had on her: “For some people, if you have major surgery or chemo, their view is stop everything and just rest and recover, but for me it's kind of the opposite, it's all these things that drive me forward. If you deal with something like cancer, it concentrates your mind more on thinking ‘I want to know that I've done something that has had an impact'. ”</p> <p>Among the tributes at the time of her death, Anne Richards, chief executive of Fidelity International, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/annerichards_all-brenda-hebb-trenowdens-many-friends-activity-6970324918223704065-wS2o?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\">wrote</a> on LinkedIn: “She believed passionately in a fairer, better future, where all talents can be given an equal chance to thrive and develop. But she was also a funny, kind, wonderful human being who was there for you when it mattered.”</p><p>Source: Sarah Gordon  2022 'Brenda Trenowden, banker and campaigner, 1967-2022' FT.com 7 September.
