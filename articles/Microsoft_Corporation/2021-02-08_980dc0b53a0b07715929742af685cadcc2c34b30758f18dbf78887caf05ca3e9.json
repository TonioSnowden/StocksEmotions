  "text": "<p>In his 2004 book \"The Wisdom of Crowds,\" James Surowiecki uses the example of people at a fairground collectively guessing the weight of an ox. The average of the guesses is closer to the weight than any individual entry. Put simply, the crowd is wiser than any individual.</p><p>A similar phenomenon occurs on Wall Street ahead of company earnings reports. Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. had returns of 20% and 12%, respectively, over the three months through Feb. 4. Much of that came before they actually announced earnings. \"Those terrific results were getting priced into the market\" by the crowd, says Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp.</p><p>So what about GameStop?</p><p>The problem with the wisdom of crowds comes down to the reliance of people on averages, says Steve Hanke, professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University. In other words, the individuals in crowds can come up with wide or narrow distributions of forecasts, with the latter being far more useful for investors. But herding can make the distributions wider and therefore not as useful. \"If you have financial assets and herding then you can easily have very wide distributions, and the wisdom of crowds doesn't hold,\" he says.</p>",
