  "text": "<p>The European telecoms sector has provided a more optimistic outlook for the year after Nokia, Cellnex and Telefónica upgraded expectations on the back of robust results. </p> <p>Yet an uneven performance continued to weigh on some of the sector's largest players. BT's shares dropped almost 6 per cent after multinational customers spent less at its global services division. Orange, the French network, also fell 4 per cent after it booked a €3.7bn write off on the value of its Spanish operation. </p> <p>Nokia, the former bellwether stock, has struggled in recent years due to fears that it could miss out on the benefits of the 5G upgrade cycle. Under Pekka Lundmark, who was appointed as chief executive last year, the company's performance has improved. </p> <p>It said on Thursday that its net sales in the second quarter grew 9 per cent on a constant currency basis to €5.3bn while its net profit increased by 71 per cent to €539m. It raised its full-year outlook for revenues by about €1bn to €21.7bn-€22.7bn and raised its expectations for its operating margin. Nokia shares, which have almost doubled since last November, gained another 7 per cent to €5.28. </p> <p>“We have executed faster than planned on our strategy in the first half which provides us with a good foundation for the full year,” said Lundmark. </p> <p>Nokia's confidence was echoed in Spain where hyper-acquisitive tower company Cellnex raised both its full-year revenue and earnings targets by €100m following a 47 per cent rise in sales in the first half of the year. Cellnex shares have risen by a quarter over the past six months and gained another 1 per cent to €55.30.</p> <p>Telefónica, the Spanish telecoms company, achieved a record net income of €7.7bn in the second quarter driven by the UK merger with Virgin Media and the sale of its Telxius towers business to American Tower. It also offered a more positive growth outlook for the year. Shares dipped 1 per cent to €3.79.</p> <p>BT, however, missed expectations as revenue fell 3 per cent to £5bn as multinational customers paused spending on telecoms services. Philip Jansen, chief executive of BT, said the outlook for its global services business was “very challenging” as spending has been cut back, but he insisted that it had not lost market share. </p> <p>Jansen said there was “no need to panic” and pointed to a new partnership with Microsoft that he expects to generate £1bn of revenue over the next seven years as a reason to be confident. “BT is putting in the heavy lifting on its path to growth,” he said. </p> <p>French telecoms company Orange, meanwhile, booked a large writedown in the value of its operation in Spain, which has been one of the most competitive telecoms markets in recent years with Vodafone, Orange and Telefónica battling low-cost upstarts. </p> <p>Orange said that its Spanish revenue declined 2.7 per cent in the second quarter. Excluding Spain, Orange's revenue in Europe grew 6 per cent and the company retained a confident tone in its outlook. </p><p>Source: Nic Fildes in London 2021 'Telecoms industry adopts more confident outlook' FT.com 29 July.
