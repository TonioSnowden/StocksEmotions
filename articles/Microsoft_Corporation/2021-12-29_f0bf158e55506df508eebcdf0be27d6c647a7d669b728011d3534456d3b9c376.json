  "text": "<p>The back-patting made it worse. Unwilling or unable to attribute his antics to, say, untreated drug addiction or trauma caused by real racism, Mr. Smollett has never admitted he made the whole thing up. This may cost him a stint in the Cook County Jail.</p><p>Mr. Smollett's case isn't as exceptional as we'd like to think. While most hate crimes doubtless occur as reported, the majority of recent high-profile narratives of hate crimes or hate incidents -- Bubba Wallace, Grand Rapids, Nikki Joly, Covington Catholic, Air Force Academy, Erica Thomas, Yasmin Seweid -- turned out to be wildly exaggerated or simply false. Duke Lacrosse, classically. Althea Bernstein, probably. Kyle Rittenhouse, for that matter.</p><p>What actually happened was often quickly apparent to intelligent observers. Videos depicting the reality were circulated online within hours of a few of these incidents. But political correctness held a million tongues. As with Mr. Smollett, this did no one any good.</p><p>My best advice: If you see something zany, say something. A sizable silent majority is aware the emperor has no clothes. Everyone is waiting on someone to say so, and being that person might just save a career or a life.</p><p>Asst. Prof. Wilfred Reilly</p><p>Kentucky State University</p><p>Frankfort, Ky.</p><p>Mr. Reilly is author of \"Hate Crime Hoax\" and other books.</p>",
