  "text": "<p>Shareholders of Activision Blizzard are the putative winners of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3726a3a-c4a0-4761-a82c-cda98abc3cb7\">largest acquisition by a technology company in history</a>. Yet they will probably remain disappointed. A scandal involving alleged sexual harassment means Microsoft would buy the computer games business cheaply. Even that exit may elude them: regulators are increasingly hostile to vertical deals.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Microsoft announced it would acquire the beleaguered group at an aggregate purchase price of $68.7bn after deducting net cash. Microsoft is already present in gaming via computer via its Xbox unit. The purchase will bulk up a division that is relatively small compared with the juggernaut's enterprise software and cloud computing businesses. </p> <p>Microsoft stands to get a plum asset for a relative song. It would not only leapfrog ahead in gaming. It would also steal a march in the metaverse land grab, since games are seen as crucial parts of that environment for young users.</p> <p>Microsoft has limited ability to build a decent video games business through organic growth. Buying such a top-tier franchise is an easier option for a tech giant with an enterprise value of $2.3tn and a cash balance of $130bn. </p> <p>Activision is best known for such titles as <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Warcraft</em> and <em>Candy Crush</em>. Such billion dollar intellectual properties takes years if not decades to create. But that value can also prove ephemeral. The gaming industry had been wracked by scandals involving abusive workplaces. </p> <p>At Activision, controversy has focused on the culture of a business whose chief executive Bobby Kotick was previously among the highest paid US bosses. The shares have fallen 37 per cent from their peak last February.</p> <p>If Microsoft was paying the same premium — 45 per cent — over the trading price of Activision shares at their historic earnings ratio of 25 times, it would have to rustle up $99bn.</p> <p>The implied purchase P/E multiple Microsoft is paying is just 26 times. The deal is a fraction of the software group's own value but large enough that virtually no other bidder — say Netflix — could try to jump in. </p> <p>Revitalised regulators are the biggest potential deal-breakers. Microsoft has a cloud subscription portal called Game Pass which already has 25m subscribers. Plugging Activision titles into GamePass would be a natural move, even though Microsoft has existing tie-ins with the likes of Electronic Arts. This would keep gamers within Microsoft's online world for longer. As in <em>Call of Duty</em>, the aim of the game is to seize and hold on to territory.</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.
