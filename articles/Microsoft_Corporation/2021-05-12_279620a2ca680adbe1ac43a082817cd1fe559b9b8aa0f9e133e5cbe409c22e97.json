  "text": "<p><em>Hi all — James here in Hong Kong. What a difference a year makes. The headlines about SoftBank in 2020 were often gloomy but today the Japanese company could surpass Microsoft to become the third most profitable company in the world. SoftBank's success is largely a reflection of Asia's tech boom (The Big Story). Also, don't miss how Coinbase's blockbuster IPO is energising Asia's crypto scene.</em> <em>Take care till next week.</em> </p> <h2>The Big Story — Exclusive </h2> <p>SoftBank is riding Asia's tech bonanza to record profits. The world's biggest tech investor was set to announce an annual net profit of about $45bn on Wednesday (after #techAsia went to press), in what would be a record haul by a Japanese company, according to this <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/SoftBank2/SoftBank-poised-for-record-45bn-net-profit-on-Vision-Fund-rebound\">exclusive </a>in Nikkei Asia. </p> <p>Its extraordinary performance was partly down to two blockbuster initial public offerings by portfolio companies: South Korea ecommerce business <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4d7ab5b-76e9-4015-bc0f-4c91c3d28a03\">Coupang</a> and food delivery group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9f8f03f-6b82-4828-84e2-7ac25966b7d1\">DoorDash</a> of the US, which raised $4.6bn and $3.37bn respectively. Huge payouts such as these may continue. </p> <p><strong>Key implications</strong>: SoftBank has been riding Asia's tech boom. Grab, the Singapore-based “super app” and another SoftBank portfolio company, is planning to go public on Nasdaq in the coming months after completing a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a44185aa-51f4-443a-895f-16dd853e1d77\">$40bn Spac merger</a>. </p> <p>Other important portfolio companies are planning similar moves. Chinese ride-hailing group Didi Chuxing, is <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/IPO/China-s-Didi-prepares-for-IPO-in-US-sources-say\">preparing an IPO </a>in the US that looks set to value the company at $70bn-$100bn. Tokopedia, the Indonesian ecommerce company, is also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-tokopedia-ipo-exclusive-idUKKBN28S0XP\">planning</a> to raise capital. China's ByteDance has postponed plans to go public but remains part of SoftBank's longer term pipeline.</p> <p><strong>Upshot</strong>: SoftBank's record profits would mark a sharp turnround from its previous annual earnings. Whether the bonanza will last depends to a great extent on stock market valuations. The sell-off in tech stocks as inflation fears stalk the markets suggests potential turbulence ahead.</p> <h2>Mercedes' top 10</h2> <ol>  <li><p>Nintendo's Switch gaming console has become a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7d74cf9-0cc3-4f7a-957e-2ede59286e27\">casualty</a> of the global chip shortage.

But there are more contemporary lessons to learn from the travails of <strong>Meituan</strong>, even beyond the obvious point that companies in China may be well advised to employ “chief poetry officers”.</p> <p>The sell-off occurred after Wang Xing, Meituan's CEO, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35a15e7a-61e3-4079-b0b1-0ff9bb420ce2\">posted</a> — and then quickly deleted — a verse from Zhang Jie, a Tang dynasty poet. One line, in translation, reads: “The ashes of burnt books had not yet faded away but the Qin dynasty was already weak.”</p> <p>This may be esoteric to many outside China but it was shared more than 32m times on Weibo, the blogging platform, and was widely seen as a veiled criticism of the Chinese leadership. Wang's 11 per cent stake in the company is estimated to have lost about $1bn in value because of his poetic flourish.</p> <p>If the verse was indeed a veiled criticism, it may have been taking aim at an official investigation into the conditions endured by Meituan's delivery drivers and a more overarching <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e59d7c0a-95d9-41eb-b068-b10c71e6da48\">anti-monopoly crackdown</a> on Chinese big tech.</p> <p>— James </p> <h2>Spotlight </h2> <p>Coinbase's blockbuster stock market listing has fired the starting gun on a pile into cryptocurrencies. In Asia, there is already plenty of action, especially with Hong Kong and Singapore having introduced regulatory sandboxes to test crypto-related rules. The challenge for many start-ups is navigating a complex regulatory environment says Flex Yang, co-founder of Hong Kong-based <strong>Babel Finance.</strong></p> <p>That's partly why his crypto financial services company has just <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Global-investment-firms-make-debut-in-Asian-cryptocurrency-market\">raised $40m</a> from investors including New York-based <strong>Tiger Global Management</strong> as well as German media conglomerate <strong>Bertelsmann</strong> and its Asia-focused investment arm <strong>BAI Capital</strong>. The deal is the first such investment in Asia's crypto finance industry for both groups. </p> <p>Yang says it is less about needing capital — Babel Finance is “very profitable” with strong cash flows. What the company — and many other young crypto companies — require is investors that can provide connections and credibility for growth. “The more institutional investors participate in the market, the less volatile it will be,” Yang said. </p> <h2>Art of the deal</h2> <p>We got news this week from <strong>Gojek</strong>, Indonesia's biggest private technology start-up but it wasn't the megamerger deal that some might have anticipated. The “super app” has <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Gojek-bags-fresh-300m-from-Indonesian-mobile-operator-Telkomsel\">bagged $300m in new funding from state-owned mobile operator <strong>Telkomsel</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The new funds are part of Telkomsel's agreement with the tech company when it invested $150m in November, which included an option to inject more money at a later date.</p> <p>That said, this will probably be Gojek's final fundraising before it completes its merger with <strong>Tokopedia</strong>. The deal, which is expected to value the merged entity at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0775a49e-d3fd-4445-a394-19039a8561f6\">about $18bn</a> and could be completed as early as next month, would be the biggest merger between two start-ups in south-east Asia's largest economy. </p> <p>Telkomsel's additional investment could provide the Indonesian mobile operator with a substantial windfall. Gojek and Tokopedia are planning to go public once the merger is finalised and are aiming for a valuation close to the $40bn that Gojek's rival <strong>Grab</strong> announced when it unveiled plans last month to go public via a Spac.</p> <h2>Smart data</h2> <p>A new trend is sweeping Taiwan: stocks. A record 670,000 people opened share-trading accounts last year, according to the Taiwan Stock Exchange. Almost half of the population is investing in shares and nearly half of last year's new accounts were opened by people under 30. The main beneficiary of this shift? <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Market-Spotlight/Taiwanese-flock-to-stocks-as-economy-shrugs-off-pandemic\">Taiwan's chip companies.</a> Shares in <strong>TSMC</strong>, <strong>United Microelectronics</strong>, <strong>Nanya Technology</strong> and <strong>MediaTek</strong> are on a tear.</p><p>Source: James Kynge and Mercedes Ruehl 2021 'SoftBank rides Asia tech bonanza to record profit' FT.com 12 May.
