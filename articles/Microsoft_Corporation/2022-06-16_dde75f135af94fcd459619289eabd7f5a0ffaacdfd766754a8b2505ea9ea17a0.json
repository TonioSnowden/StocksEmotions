  "text": "<p>Ever more people are encountering our journalism for the first time on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or YouTube, where our accounts have a total of nearly 60m followers. However, size is not everything and we want to do more to turn this audience into the next generation of subscribers.</p><p>We are seeking a Social-Media Fellow to assist with our strategy to extend the reach of The Economist's journalism on digital platforms. This one-year fellowship is an entry-level position with a salary of £26,000. It will be based in our main newsroom in central London but with a specific remit to reach audiences in North America, while remaining true to our 179-year-old brand.</p><p>The fellow will collaborate with journalists in locations such as New York, Washington and Toronto, as part of our social-media team of ten. As a result they should expect to work shifts: typically they may be on duty during UK evenings for two weeks out of three, with regular office hours at other times. We are following a hybrid model and anticipate that we will spend at least two to three days per week in the office. All applicants must be based in the UK to take up the role—and we can only consider those who already hold the right to live and work in London without the need for any further visa-application process.</p><p>The successful candidate will collaborate with multiple editorial and digital departments. They will be an innovative, unstoppable newshound with an interest in, and knowledge of, current affairs, politics and finance around the world, but particularly in North America. They will have suggestions for how we can tailor our content for a uniquely American audience and knowledge of the regional media landscape. They might have some junior experience as a journalist, either through internships or perhaps for a university newsroom, or have experience in telling engaging stories online.</p><p>Importantly, they will understand how The Economist's brand and social-media output fit into the global media landscape—and how we cover events such as the mid-term elections, the hearings of Congress's January 6th 2021 committee, the threat to abortion rights and the Federal Reserve's attempts to rein in inflation.</p><p>They will be expected to:</p><p>• Help distribute our journalism across digital channels, primarily via social-media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn but also through push alerts and newsletters, to audiences in North America and globally</p><p>• Devise ways to create and publish engaging content that turns our journalism into easily digestible material for a mobile-first audience</p><p>• Work closely with—and learn from—an award-winning team of talented, motivated editors and producers</p><p>To succeed they should have:</p><p>• The ability to share our journalism in engaging ways, both in text and visually (eg, graphics, charts or videos)</p><p>• Thorough knowledge of different social-media networks, as well as emerging digital trends and platforms, and how The Economist fits into them</p><p>• An understanding of multimedia content, which could include basic editing skills for video or audio</p><p>• Strong writing and proofreading skills, using British English</p><p>• Good communication skills, both written and oral</p><p>• A thorough grasp of current affairs, both in North America and elsewhere</p><p>• Excellent news judgment and a commitment to producing accurate and engaging journalism that meets our editorial guidelines and is true to our brand</p><p>• The ability to be a self starter, capable of working both independently and within a team structure</p><p>• Applicants should outline how they would explain America's cost-of-living crisis to followers of The Economist's Instagram account, through a mixture of written and visual journalism. Ideas for our other social platforms are also welcome. The assessment should be no longer than 600 words. These articles may prove valuable as research:</p><p>What America's next recession will look likeWhy the Federal Reserve has made a historic mistake on inflationHousing in America has become much harder to affordWhy Americans are poorly served by their grocery storesThe coming food catastrophe</p><p>Your assessment is the most important part of your application, so make sure you explain your proposals thoroughly and clearly. We will read it blind, without seeing your name or your experience. Only if what is written fits with what we are looking for will we examine your accompanying material. We cannot consider applications submitted without an assessment.</p><p>Please send your assessment, along with your CV and a brief cover letter explaining why you would like to work at The Economist, to edsocialjob@economist.com. The closing date is Sunday July 10th 2022. We anticipate the fellowship will begin in late August or early September.</p><p>The Economist Group values diversity. We are committed to equal opportunities and creating an inclusive environment for all our employees. We welcome applicants regardless of ethnic origin, national origin, gender, race, colour, religious beliefs, disability, sexual orientation or age.</p>",
