  "title": "Netflix names Microsoft as partner for ad-supported platform; Microsoft will handle the technology and sales needed for Netflix to offer ad-supported subscription plan, which is expected to be cheaper than other Netflix streaming options",
  "text": "<p>\"It's very early days and we have much to work through,\" Peters continued. \"But our long-term goal is clear: More choice for consumers and a premium, better-than-linear TV brand experience for advertisers. We're excited to work with Microsoft as we bring this new service to life.\"</p><p>Microsoft's MSFT selection by the streaming giant is part of an ambitious business-strategy reboot by Netflix to bump up revenue and subscriptions after it reported a dip in net paid subscription additions for the first time in a decade.</p><p>For years, Netflix has been reluctant to introduce an ad-supported service but indicated in April it was open to the idea after disappointing quarterly results amid tough economic conditions and escalating competition from Walt Disney Co. DIS, Apple Inc. AAPL, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Comcast Corp. CMCSA, Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. WBD and others. An ad-supported subscription option could arrive this year on Netflix, which reports second-quarter earnings on Tuesday.</p><p>In a tweet, Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said the partnership would give publishers \"more long-term viable ad monetization platforms, so more people can access the content they love wherever they are.\"</p><p>The news propelled Netflix's battered stock up 2% in trading Wednesday. Microsoft shares were flat.</p><p>\"This deal gives Microsoft something its growing ad business has lacked–quality streaming video inventory that has potential to scale,\" Insider Intelligence analyst Ross Benes said. \"Unlike the top three ad sellers in Google GOOGL GOOG, Meta META and Amazon, Microsoft hasn't pushed competing streaming products.\"</p><p>Some analysts predict an ad-supported streaming platform could bring in as much as an additional $1 billion in quarterly revenue for Netflix, given the prevalence of such models — 57% of streaming watchers have a mix of ad-supported and ad-free streaming services, according to market researcher Gartner.</p><p>However, consumers consider cost (76%) and content (63%) as the top considerations when choosing a plan, according to a Gartner survey of 303 U.S. consumers conducted in May. Advertising is at the bottom of the list, at 11%.</p><p>Netflix names Microsoft as partner for ad-supported platform</p>",
