  "title": "London Exchange Stake Gives  Microsoft Foothold in Finance  ----  By Josh Mitchell",
  "text": "<p>   LONDON -- Microsoft Corp. will take a 4% stake in the London Stock Exchange's corporate parent and help shift the exchange's financial data and trading platforms to the cloud, in a deal that reflects the growing use of data and tech in global finance. </p><p>   The deal revealed on Monday calls for London Stock Exchange Group PLC, owner of Europe's biggest stock exchange by market value, to spend $2.8 billion over the next decade on Microsoft products, mainly its Azure cloud service. </p><p>   The deal brings together one of the U.S.'s biggest tech companies with Europe's biggest market exchange, combining the former's cloud-computing and conferencing software with the latter's growing batch of financial data. </p><p>   \"We are building substantial new products together on an entirely different scale\" from prior partnerships, LSEG Chief Executive Officer David Schwimmer said on a call with analysts. \"We will be investing together. We will be designing products together. We will be going to markets together.\" </p><p>   LSEG shares were up 3% on Monday in London. </p><p>   The deal reflects the growing symbiosis between big tech and financial-markets companies. Last year, Alphabet Inc.'s Google invested $1 billion in futures-exchange giant CME Group Inc. and struck a deal to move the company's core trading systems to the cloud. </p><p>   Weeks later, Nasdaq Inc. announced a deal to begin moving its North American markets to Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Web Services cloud-computing platform. </p><p>   \"It seems Microsoft (and the LSE) don't want to be left out,\" said Niki Beattie, CEO of consulting firm Market Structure Partners. </p><p>   For tech companies, these deals guarantee a steady stream of cash from exchanges for the use of cloud services, she said. </p><p>   In addition to the $2.8 billion that LSEG has agreed to spend on the Azure cloud, Microsoft expects to earn an additional $2.2 billion over 10 years from traders, investors, and financial advisers who do business with the LSEG and use the cloud, it said. </p><p>   For exchanges, the deals allow them to make greater use of data and reach a broader set of customers. </p><p>   \"The use of data and processing is ramping up so significantly that it will be hard to move forward at pace if they are not thinking about how to re-platform their offerings on the cloud,\" Ms. Beattie said. </p><p>   The LSEG has staked its future on selling data, a way to diversify away from the low-margin stock-exchange business. </p><p>   In 2021, it completed the purchase of financial-information and terminal business Refinitiv Holdings Ltd. from a consortium of Blackstone Inc. and Thomson Reuters Corp. </p><p>   Microsoft is taking the unusual step of buying an ownership stake in a client -- it will acquire the LSEG shares from the Blackstone-Reuters consortium. Microsoft didn't disclose how much it would pay for the shares. </p><p>   Judson Althoff, Microsoft's executive vice president and chief commercial officer, said the equity stake made sense given how long and closely the two companies will be working together. </p><p>   Mr. Schwimmer said the equity stake aligns incentives between LSEG and Microsoft and allows the consortium to move forward with a plan to sell its LSEG stake. </p><p>   \"We don't need capital -- we generate a lot of cash flow -- and we don't have any need to sell equity,\" he said. </p><p>   Mr. Althoff compared the potential new products that emerge from the partnership to a Zoom video call that allows participants to pull up research notes, share documents, and type into a group chat all at once. </p><p>   Financial advisers will be able to do that using LSEG's data with one screen, he said. </p><p>   \"This will revolutionize the way financial advisers provide advice to their clients,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
