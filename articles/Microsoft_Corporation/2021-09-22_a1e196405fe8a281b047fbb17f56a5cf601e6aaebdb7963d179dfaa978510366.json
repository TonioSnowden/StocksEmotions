  "text": "<p>The actions on Tuesday are the latest effort by the Biden administration to curtail the growing problem of ransomware attacks, which are estimated to plunder hundreds of millions of dollars annually from American businesses and in recent months have hobbled critical U.S. infrastructure. Russian criminal hacker groups are responsible for a large portion of ransomware strikes against the West, officials say, making the issue a diplomatic concern for President Biden as well. It also sets the stage for a broader sanctioning of the crypto sector as the U.S. acts to weed out its use by criminals, terrorists and others.</p><p>Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said the sanctioning of SUEX should be seen as a warning to other bad actors in the digital-currency marketplace, reflecting the administration's intention to \"disrupt and deter these criminals by going after their financial enablers.\"</p><p>More sanctions should be expected, officials said. \"We will continue to crack down on malicious actors,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said.</p><p>Representatives for SUEX, incorporated in the Czech Republic but whose owners live in Russia, according to corporate records, didn't respond to requests for comment. The sanctions prohibit U.S.-based firms from doing business with SUEX and blocks any assets it has within U.S. jurisdiction.</p><p>Senior U.S. officials said the exchange was singled out because of intelligence analysis showing 40% of its transactions were with groups known to engage in illicit activity. Additionally, SUEX had helped process payments linked to at least eight ransomware variants, officials said. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis Inc. said it found SUEX has received more than $481 million in bitcoin since it was founded in 2018, but a third of it -- over $160 million -- has come from those identified as scammers, people operating on the dark web and ransomware gangs.</p><p>Although Tuesday's action introduces a new sanctions regime meant to rein in illicit activity in the crypto sector, the administration was careful to say that only a small portion of digital currency transactions are used for illicit purposes. Officials also said the updated guidance is intended to motivate cybersecurity improvements among businesses and more transparency when they suffer an attack.</p><p>Officials said they are probing three particular types of cryptocurrency services for which criminals have shown preferences because of their anonymity: So-called \"nested\" exchanges, such as SUEZ, that piggyback off large crypto platforms; peer-to-peer platforms that allow direct, confidential transactions between parties; and \"mixers,\" whose exchange services make tracking transactions more difficult.</p><p>\"SUEX filled an essential niche in the ecosystem of underregulated exchanges that, either through willful ignorance or witting cooperation, facilitate the conversion of illicit crypto ransoms into real-world currency,\" said Ari Redbord, a former senior Treasury official now at the blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs.</p><p>But while the action homes in on just a sliver of the crypto market, \"major exchanges are also on notice,\" given the risk of their services being used by criminals, Mr. Redbord said.</p><p>SUEX markets itself online as one of the largest crypto exchanges in Moscow, offering clients the ability to exchange up to 500 bitcoins -- equivalent to more than $21 million at the current exchange rate. On the firm's LinkedIn page, it advertises itself as \"processing high risk payments.\" Its owners also are associated with other crypto and digital payment services, including an online bank created last year by one of Russia's largest network providers.</p><p>Tuesday's sanction and updated guidance is part of a broader effort to regulate cryptocurrencies and other digital assets as the market becomes increasingly mainstream. Current and former U.S. finance and security officials say the financial technology offers the potential to revolutionize the global financial system in myriad beneficial ways. Treasury officials said they are trying to balance encouraging innovation and market growth with the need to protect national security.</p><p>---</p><p>Robert McMillan contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
