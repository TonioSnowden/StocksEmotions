Even now, what is being proposed has to do with data collected by GPs and will not necessarily include data generated at other NHS sites, particularly within hospitals. Truly comprehensive digital patient records are rarely available. </p> <p>Yet the technology to make such data available — and end our reliance on paper records — has been around for over 30 years. See Bill Gates' 1995 book <em>Business @ the Speed of Thought</em>. </p> <p>Although there are issues concerning the confidentiality of such records, “opting out” has become the accepted way to deal with this issue in other countries. </p> <p><strong>Peter Ford</strong> <br><em>London SW20, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Opting out is one solution to NHS records concerns' FT.com 2 June.
