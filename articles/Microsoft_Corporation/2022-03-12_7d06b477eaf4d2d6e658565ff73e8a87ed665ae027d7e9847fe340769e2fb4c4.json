  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Amazon.com seems interested in brushing up its image on Wall Street. Washington might require even more finesse. </p><p>\n  A stock split and share buyback plan announced late Wednesday shows the tech giant is working on the former. Amazon hasn't split its shares since 1999 and, before this year, hadn't repurchased any since 2012. </p><p>\n  The new buyback plan worth $10 billion replaces a $5 billion plan from 2016. That original plan went unused until Amazon started buying back shares in January. </p><p>\n  Meanwhile, a 20-for-1 split would make Amazon's shares more accessible to retail investors and allow more flexibility for its employees, now numbering more than 1.6 million, to manage their equity in the company. It also could make the stock, which has spent most of the last year above the $3,000 range, a candidate for inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. If enacted now, the split would put Amazon's share price just below the current median of the price-weighted index. </p><p>\n  Google parent Alphabet announced a similar split in February, and the two, with a combined market value of $3.2 trillion, are the largest U.S.-based public companies not currently members of the Blue Chip index. </p><p>\n  Amazon's latest moves constitute \"one part in a series of increasingly shareholder-friendly actions,\" according to Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Amazon recently raised the price of its Prime service and began breaking out financial details of its ad business, which generates more than $31 billion a year in revenue. </p><p>\n  Amazon shares rose 5.4% on Thursday despite a broad market selloff. Yet even with that bounce, Amazon's share price is down 13% from when the company announced in February 2021 that founder Jeff Bezos would be passing the chief executive baton to Andy Jassy. Big tech peers Microsoft and Apple have averaged an 18% gain in that time; the S&amp;P 500 has risen 11%. </p><p>\n  A more shareholder-friendly Amazon could help turn that sentiment, especially as the company enters a slower-growth phase more befitting an enterprise about to pass $500 billion in annual sales. But Mr. Jassy also needs to figure out how to carry that sentiment over to Washington, which has taken an especially dim view of Amazon of late. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that the House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the Justice Department seeking an investigation into Amazon for a potentially criminal obstruction of Congress, a move not taken against other tech giants that are being investigated by lawmakers for alleged anticompetitive behavior. </p><p>\n  Amazon, which denies the claim, is aiming to clear its purchase of MGM with Washington soon and presumably wants the option to do more deals as rivals Microsoft and Google pursue transactions of their own. Getting to that point may require something even $13 billion can't buy -- charm. </p><p></p>",
