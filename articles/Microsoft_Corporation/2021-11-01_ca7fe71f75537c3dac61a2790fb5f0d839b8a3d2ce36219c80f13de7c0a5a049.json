  "text": "<p>As we report today, Navitas has now raised $160 million for its third venture fund to invest in early-stage startups.</p><p>\"For early investors in proptech there's been a windfall in the last 12 months. And now lots of new bets are being made,\" said Travis Putnam, co-founder and managing partner of Navitas.</p><p>Navitas, led by Mr. Putnam and Managing Partner Louis Schotsky, joins several other venture firms focused on the real-estate technology space that recently raised new funds, including Zigg Capital, which raised a $225 million second fund in December, and MetaProp, which announced a $100 million fund in June.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>DeFi. Musicians who distribute their work on streaming platforms typically wait weeks to get paid for the traffic they generate. Paperchain Inc., a startup that just raised pre-seed money, says it has a way to get that down to a few days and produce a steady stream of income for musicians, WSJ Pro's David Carnevali reports.</p><p>The New York-based startup uses loans from decentralized finance, or DeFi, and estimates what an artist's daily streaming traffic is worth in order to fast track payments.</p><p>Delayed payment is a chronic issue in the music industry and can be particularly hard on young artists, who may need immediate access to cash to reinvest in their brands, build their careers and make a living, industry observers say. Alphabet Inc .'s YouTube , which deals with creators directly, is among the quickest payers among streaming platforms; others, like Spotify Technology SA , which channels payments through intermediaries like labels and music distributors, take longer. Spotify declined to comment on how long it takes to process invoices.</p><p>4.4%</p><p>Rise in September of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the personal-consumption-expenditures price index. (WSJ)</p><p>Secondary Transactions on Pace to Reach $100 Billion This Year</p><p>The market for secondhand stakes in private-markets assets is expected to hit a milestone this year, as strong investment performance has encouraged more institutional investors and fund managers to explore sales, WSJ Pro reports. Buyers and intermediaries say this year they expect total secondary transaction volume to reach, if not exceed, $100 billion for the first time ever, as the market enters what has historically been its busiest quarter. Secondary adviser Triago said transaction volume hit roughly $79 billion through the first nine months of 2021, and the Paris-based firm expects volume to reach some $113 billion by year-end. The pace would surpass both the record $83 billion that Triago tracked for 2019 and $71 billion in 2020.</p><p>Digital Currency Group Wants to Be Crypto's Standard Oil</p><p>Digital Currency Group Inc ., a cryptocurrency conglomerate that counts the asset-management firm Grayscale and media company CoinDesk among its holdings, raised $700 million in an investment round, the second-largest in the crypto sector, WSJ reports. The funding round valued the company at $10 billion and was led by SoftBank Group Corp .'s Vision Fund 2 and Latin America Fund, and included GIC, Ribbit Capital and Alphabet Inc.'s CapitalG . SoftBank began investing in the sector about three months ago. \"We hadn't made any investments in crypto because we didn't think it was ready,\" said Marcelo Claure , the chief executive of SoftBank Group International.</p><p>New Fund Targets Stranded Unicorns</p><p>For every $1 billion-plus private company, there is another startup struggling to raise funds in a venture-capital world obsessed with growth, WSJ reports. Billions are being poured into the hottest startups, pushing private valuations to new heights and the number of unicorns world-wide to more than 800. But as VC firms search for the next Beyond Meat Inc ., they are quick to abandon companies they believe will never become darlings of private and public investors.</p><p>Experience Management Forum</p><p>If you are interested in fintech and customer experience, come along to the WSJ Experience Management Forum on Monday. Speakers include executives from two venture-backed companies: Ronald Oliveira, U.S. chief executive of Revolut and David Sandstrom, chief marketing officer of Klarna.
