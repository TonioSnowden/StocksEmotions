In the latest case, the clean energy company Invenergy said on Friday that<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c690a6af-abe7-44fd-9dca-c5f69cb2dd2d\"> it had been hacked</a> but did “not intend to pay any ransom”, after Russia-linked hacking group REvil threatened to leak embarrassing details about its billionaire chief executive.&#xa0;</p> <p>On Sunday, President Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin appeared to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81c644d4-811f-4d9c-b4ac-bb0ee1038526\">give separate commitments</a> that they would help one another bring cyber criminals to justice. But while Putin spoke of allowing extraditions to the US, Biden said he would be committed to US criminals being held accountable in America.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a26196c-ee82-45ad-a138-16d0884f4f09\">In an FT opinion piece,</a> the former head of Britain's MI6 Alex Younger argues the reality is that many ransomware gangs are in Russia, “and as long as they don't intrude on Russian interests, they will be left alone”.</p> <p>At today's Nato summit, leaders are expected to sign off on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f454033a-9975-4efd-92eb-9cf63306af7f\">a confidential cyber defence strategy</a>, which includes extending existing powers to invoke Nato's “Article 5” principle of collective defence in cases of cyber attacks,</p> <p>“[This] will upgrade the defence, political and intelligence dimensions of cyber across the alliance,” said Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser. “And in the communiqué that will be released, there will be a strong commitment to Nato's emphasis on cyber deterrence and collective defence.”</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>Vodafone boosts Huawei's 5G competitors</strong><br>Open RAN 5G networks allow a multiplicity of suppliers and Vodafone <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/338ad9aa-0a4b-4f7c-bcc4-beddb994f884\">announced on Monday</a> that Samsung Electronics, NEC, Dell and Wind River would help it build Europe's first commercial open RAN network. They are benefiting from Huawei's exclusion. &#xa0;The Chinese company has just reported that its UK operating unit's 2020 revenues<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb58f6bb-b12f-405d-9c10-20b6aa06765f\"> fell 27 per cent</a> to £913m. Sony is one company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/353138d3-ae45-4771-8104-b0dfebec9241\">not being helped</a> by Huawei's decline, with less demand for its image sensors for smartphones.</p> <p><strong>Big Tech faces smart TV curbs</strong><br>Google, Amazon and Samsung's bargaining power with broadcasters is set to be reined in by the UK government through<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bebcf05-1e0e-497c-90aa-91c4f9914e63\"> an overhaul of broadcasting </a>rules to guarantee the prominence of public service media such as the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 on smart televisions.

Spending by marketers will increase $78bn to $657bn, largely driven by the flourishing digital ad market, according to the Magna research group.</p> <p><strong>Space trip sold for $28m</strong><br>A ticket to take a brief trip to space with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos next month has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/956cb2cf-ab9e-45d2-bc47-1c19f5458ba8\">sold at auction for $28m. </a>The identity of the winning bidder has not yet been made public, nor that of the fourth passenger who will join Bezos and his brother Mark.</p> <p><strong>Shine taken off Shein</strong><br>Popular Chinese ecommerce platform Shein, whose big data-driven designs have propelled it to the top of app download charts, is<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b87df56a-cb71-4b6a-8c36-6e2db9a52c7c\"> facing complaints</a> from apparel brands that claim it has infringed their intellectual property.
