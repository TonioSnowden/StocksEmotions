  "title": "Steve Ballmer Can't Curb His Enthusiasm; The Clippers owner has experienced highs and tough lows, but remains committed to building an NBA champion — and now, a bespoke new arena in Los Angeles",
  "text": "<p>\"Regular games, I'll bring people I know, but more casually—fun people, or people who aren't totally into basketball,\" says the 65-year-old Ballmer, the former Microsoft CEO who purchased the Clippers for $2 billion in the wake of the Donald Sterling fiasco in 2014, and can often be found, courtside, flapping his limbs in various states of exultation, depending on how well the Clips are faring.</p><p>\"There'll be some socialization until midway through the third quarter, and then it starts to really shrink down,\" Ballmer says. \"I would say my level of non-basketball conversation shrinks after halftime.\"</p><p>And the playoffs? Forget casual.</p><p>\"I'm not going to playoff games with people who aren't locked in,\" Ballmer says matter-of-factly. \"It's just not going to happen.\"</p><p>He's hoping for more of the locked-in stuff. The Clippers assembled a history-making season in 2020-21, reaching the Western Conference Finals for the first time, despite losing star Kawhi Leonard to a knee injury along the way. It was the deepest the tormented franchise has ever gotten, but without Leonard, Los Angeles ended up falling in the conference final to Phoenix and former Clipper Chris Paul.</p><p>\"What was the old thing from ABC's 'Wide World of Sports'? \" Ballmer asks. \"The thrill of victory—and the agony of defeat? I had all of that last year. I'm sad we didn't win. On the other hand, I'm really proud of the way we played.\"</p><p>The Clippers are in a fluid spot this season, which for them begins Thursday, with a road game against Golden State. The electrically talented Leonard is out, recovering from surgery, and his timetable to return is unclear. (\"Nobody knows when he might be back,\" Ballmer says. \"I sure don't know.\") Still, the core that rallied to sink the top-seeded Jazz in the semis—players like Paul George, Reggie Jackson and Terance Mann—is in place, alongside new additions like Eric Bledsoe, a former Clipper back for a second stint. Sports prognostication outfits have slotted the Clippers somewhere between 45 and 49 wins.</p><p>\"We're going to go hard,\" Ballmer says. \"I think we'll overachieve what some forecast for us.\"</p><p>It's been more than seven years since Ballmer took over a franchise reeling from revelations of Sterling's racist talk as well as decades of neglect. Ballmer's arrival gave the Clips an immediate reputation and performance upgrade. Though they lag far behind their current roommates, the championship-hoarding Lakers, in the glamour galaxy and local mindshare, they have made the playoffs six of the past seven seasons, and are far from the old punch line. Forbes recently valued the Clippers at $3.3 billion, the sixth-most valuable franchise in the league.</p><p>Ballmer says he doesn't stick his paws into daily machinations of the Clippers roster—\"I think it is important to let the guys who run the team, run the team,\" he says. He focuses more on big picture moves, the largest of which is a recently announced Clippers arena, the Intuit Dome, located in Inglewood and scheduled to open for the 2024-25 season.</p><p>The ever-enthusiastic Ballmer turns gleeful as he describes what a bespoke arena will feel like—noisy stands full of Clipper obsessives Ballmer calls \"grinders\"; a hyper-detailed scoreboard with augmented reality; cabana-style courtside suites for high rollers. The Clippers sent me an Intuit Dome breakdown so granular it included the number of urinals: 350.</p><p>\"The bathrooms I'm hardcore about,\" Ballmer says. \"Is the sink deep enough?…I already told them, I don't think the sinks are deep enough, so we're going back through sink depth.\"</p><p>Ballmer's ambition is a state-of-the-art barn where fans can lock in like he does. An unintended consequence of recent sports arena overhauls (improved food options, lounges and other frills) is an audience too distracted to return to its seats. While Ballmer won't be skimping on the fine foods and comforts—he's assured that the seats in the upper deck are as plush as the ones on the baseline—he wants a stadium that's \"about the game.\"</p><p>\"I want people actually back out in their seats,\" Ballmer says.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Clippers keep chasing the title which continues to elude them. Ballmer says that one of the biggest differences between big tech and the NBA is the latter's ruthlessly accelerated timetable for success. Whereas a global company might take months or years to determine whether an initiative succeeded, a basketball team is judged by every 24 ticks of the shot clock.</p><p>\"There's no guesswork,\" Ballmer says. \"Boom, performance review, 24 seconds. Performance review, boom, boom, boom, boom.\"</p><p>\"I've learned more about accountability than I used to know, and I thought I knew a lot about accountability at Microsoft,\" Ballmer says.</p><p>He is no longer an NBA newbie. It's happened only a couple of times, he says—but Ballmer has been pulled aside by individuals who are mulling a purchase of a sports team.</p><p>What does he tell them?</p><p>\"I emphasize that it's more fun than I thought,\" he says. At the same time, Ballmer cautions against the idea of palling around with a team.</p><p>\"There are guys who come in and say, 'Hey, I'm going to be players' friend.' No—there are people who work for you, and they're all more expert and better than you are. And you've got to respect that.\"</p><p>He chuckles. \"Why would some 25-year-old want to be buddies with some 60-year-old? It really doesn't make sense on the face of it.\"</p><p>\"I talk about the fact that the business side is more interesting than I thought. I talk about the fact that, if you're into the sport, it's not quite like being at one of your kids' games—but it's a lot closer to being at one of your kids' games than just being a spectator.\"</p><p>There's your answer. That's what it's like to sit next to Steve Ballmer at a Clippers game.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What teams do you expect to contend for the NBA title this season?</p><p>Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com</p><p>Steve Ballmer Can't Curb His Enthusiasm</p>",
