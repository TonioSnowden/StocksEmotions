  "text": "<p>Good afternoon from London. With the Oscars a couple of months away, it reminds us that acting is not just for actors. There are times in our working lives when putting on an act at work helps to survive tricky moments — a sign of emotional intelligence.</p> <p>Thank you for reading our Business School Briefing — <em><strong>Wai Kwen Chan and&#xa0;Andrew Jack.</strong></em></p> <h2>FT research award: smart ideas with real impact</h2> <p>From tackling waste to fighting cancer, discover the winners of the 2022 FT responsible business education award for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5ca2a09-333b-4f86-9e99-3a3bf1b86c75\">academic research with societal impact</a>. Check out our full <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/responsible-business-education\">Responsible Business Education </a> coverage. </p> <p>Protecting the livelihoods of India's waste-pickers while recycling trash was a key concern of the study co-authored by Fiona Marshall of the University of Sussex, UK, one of the four finalists.</p> <h2>Help us improve our newsletter</h2> <p>We want to hear what you would like to read, what content we should keep or ditch. <a href=\"https://www.ft-rankings.com/se/705E3EC81591E7E3\">Please take our survey</a>, which is open until Feb 1.</p> <h2>News round up</h2> <p>Thunderbird School of Global Management is offering a free online five-course, 15 credit certificate in <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/lifelong-learning/100-million-learners\">global management and entrepreneurship</a>. Designed to reach 100m learners in 40 languages, it has been funded by a $25m donation from Francis and Dionne Najafi.</p> <h2>Andrew Hill's management challenge</h2> <p>Singer Adele <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/adele-opens-up-about-her-inspirations-looks-and-stage-fright-79626/\">told Rolling Stone</a> in 2011 that she overcame stage fright by channelling a persona she calls “Sasha Carter”, a combination of Beyoncé's alter ego Sasha Fierce and country singer June Carter. Hollywood actor Chris Pratt <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/bryson-dechambeau-chris-pratt-hollywood-netflix-american-b1992628.html\">advised</a> volatile US golfer Bryson DeChambeau to “play [a] fictional character for a while” to get through a spate of attacks on his performance and behaviour last year.</p> <p>As I <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/729d9bc6-7ff7-49cc-937d-232b7212c3fe\">write this week</a>, it's unusual for corporate leaders to admit they pretend to be someone else in order to improve performance, but plenty take advice about how to strengthen their “executive presence”. For my <strong>management challenge</strong>, what do you find works to lift your self-confidence at work? Send your advice to <strong>bschool@ft.com</strong>. If you'd rather we kept secret your penchant for pretending to be Russell Crowe in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbBiXPVKuTA\"><em>Gladiator</em></a> to get through sales meetings, just let us know.</p> <p>I sought your advice last week about how managers can ensure the right lessons are learnt from disasters. <strong>Niall Macdonald</strong> agrees that you should never blame subordinates in public. His three-point plan for sorting out problems in private: “Did she fix it properly? Good. Did he not fix it properly? Not so good. Did he/she do nothing? Very bad.”</p> <p><strong>In further reading</strong>, I've been thinking about <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/business/davos-man-marc-benioff-book.html?utm_source=pocket_mylist\">this hard-hitting essay</a> in the New York Times, adapted from Peter Goodman's new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Davos-Man-Billionaires-Devoured-World/dp/0063078309\"><em>Davos Man: How the Billionaires Devoured the World</em></a>. Goodman takes issue with one Davos man in particular, Marc Benioff, founder of Salesforce. He writes that Benioff “relished his identity as a digital disrupter intent on turning business into the driver for social change. But his philanthropy, his genuine likability and his commitment to improving the state of the world obscured the central reality of his enterprise: He was an enabler, a beneficiary and a custodian of the world as it was.”</p> <h2>Data line: Environmental, social, and governance teaching</h2> <p>Executive MBA and Masters in Management graduates who studied outside Europe rate their business schools' delivery of ESG topics more highly than those from European institutions. Only MBA graduates from European schools rate ESG teaching highly than their peers elsewhere, <em>write Sam Stephens and Leo Cremonezi.</em></p> <p>Further analysis of FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1177bd03-22a4-42e1-9d83-bec979755c4d\">European Business Schools ranking can be found&#xa0;here</a>.</p> <h2>Join us for the FT's ‘Future of Business Education: Spotlight on MBA'</h2> <p>We will be holding a virtual event on Feb 23 Wednesday 2022 with FT Editorial and top business schools sharing insights about the FT MBA ranking, responsible business education, innovation and the future of the MBA in a post Covid-19 world.
