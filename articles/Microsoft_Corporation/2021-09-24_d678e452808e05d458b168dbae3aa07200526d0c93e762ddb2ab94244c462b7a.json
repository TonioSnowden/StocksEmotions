  "title": "Dell to Buy Back $5 Billion, Gives Post-Spinoff Outlook",
  "text": "<p>Dell has said that the spinoff, in which it plans to sell its $52 billion stake in the cloud-computing company, is part of a strategy to strengthen its finances. When Dell announced the spinoff in April, it owned about 81% of VMware, whose technology supports apps, network solutions and companies' cloud-computing operations.</p><p>Dell shareholders are set to receive a special cash dividend of $11.5 billion to $12 billion from the spinoff, including $9.3 billion to $9.7 billion for Dell itself. Dell has said it plans to use cash from the dividend to pay down debt.</p><p>Dell, founded by Michael Dell in 1984, is in its second stint as a publicly traded company. It first went public in 1988, but Mr. Dell and Silver Lake, a private-equity firm, took the company private in a 2013 leveraged buyout. The current New York Stock Exchange listing dates to 2018, when Dell returned to public markets through a transaction in which it bought out the shareholders of a pre-existing stock that tracked Dell's VMware stake.</p><p>As Dell parts ways with VMware, growth opportunities will come from Dell's infrastructure-solutions business, which supports enterprise computing needs, and its client-solutions business, which focuses on personal computers, Dell executives told analysts in a Thursday presentation.</p><p>Growth in those business lines will help Dell boost its revenue and profit over the next five years, Dell said. The company expects single-digit-percentage annual sales and profit growth through the fiscal year ending in January 2026. Dell estimated revenue will increase at an annual rate of 3% to 4%, and adjusted earnings per share will rise by more than 6% a year during that period.</p><p>In the 12 months through January, Dell logged $94.22 billion of revenue and adjusted earnings of $8.00 a share, results that included contributions from VMware.</p><p>Other computing companies have also been boosting their buyback plans. Earlier this month, Microsoft Corp.'s board approved a plan to buy back up to $60 billion of its stock. Few S&amp;P 500 index members spend more on repurchases than Microsoft does, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p><p>Across the economy, strong earnings have lifted companies' cash balances in recent quarters, a trend that has led to rising buybacks. Many companies have turned to repurchasing shares, rather than investing in capital expenditures, as supply shortages limit good investment opportunities.</p><p>Share repurchases at S&amp;P 500 companies rose to $370.4 billion in the first half of the year, up 29% from the same period a year ago. In comparison, capital spending -- which usually goes toward assets such as land, buildings and technology -- increased 4.8% to $337.17 billion in that period.</p><p>Meanwhile, Democrats have proposed taxing buybacks as Congress debates ways to fund trillions of dollars of healthcare, education and climate legislation. Some Republican congressmen have said they oppose that plan.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
