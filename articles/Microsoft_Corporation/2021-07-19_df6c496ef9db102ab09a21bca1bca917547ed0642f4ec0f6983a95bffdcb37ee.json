  "text": "<p>Zoom Video Communications, the video conferencing start-up whose services became globally popular during the coronavirus pandemic, has agreed a deal to buy cloud software provider Five9 for about $14.7bn in its first major acquisition.</p> <p>The all-stock transaction values Five9 shares at $200.28 with shareholders in the company set to receive 0.5533 shares of Zoom class A common stock. Shares in Five9 closed at $177.60 on Friday. </p> <p>Zoom's deal with Five9, which offers call centres via cloud computing, will help expand the company's Zoom Phone offering. It comes as the San Jose, California-based company prepares for a post-pandemic slowdown following its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f388aac-9e41-4ce4-bc30-187bad688d8a\">explosive growth</a> in 2020. </p> <p>In the 12 months to January 31, Zoom's annual sales quadrupled to $2.65bn and its share price has risen more than 400 per cent since the start of 2020, though it remains below its October high. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34055e16-a70a-11ea-92e2-cbd9b7e28ee6\">Eric Yuan</a>, Zoom's chief executive, has been eager to capitalise on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/170649d0-4cdf-454b-a4ec-e28d130974cd\">huge audience</a> that signed up to its services last year as millions of people were forced to log into virtual meetings during lockdowns. He said this year that the company would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f05fc2b9-3dee-4b27-87d1-ae05cae60109\">move to expand</a> its range of communications services. </p> <p>“We are continuously looking for ways to enhance our platform, and the addition of Five9 is a natural fit that will deliver even more happiness and value to our customers,” Yuan said in a statement on Sunday. </p> <p>While Zoom is predominantly known for its video conferencing services, it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19bfe53b-c282-483c-a02c-e3d2c5184929\">has been promoting</a> various office collaboration products including Zoom Phone, a cloud phone system, and its conference software, Zoom Rooms. </p> <p>Five9's software is used by a number of companies that Zoom is seeking <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c7894c7-84af-4719-95c4-691fffb53dcc\">to displace</a>, including Microsoft Teams and Salesforce. In 2017, Mike Burkland, now the company's chair, told Barron's that he expected Five9 to be purchased by one of its larger partners.</p><p>Source: Ortenca Aliaj in New York 2021 'Zoom buys cloud call centre company Five9 for almost $15bn' FT.com 19 July.
