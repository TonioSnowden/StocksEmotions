  "title": "Mark Zuckerberg's Latest Pivot Is Personal as Well as Strategic; Facebook co-founder's plan to focus on the metaverse is a bold play as he and the company are under more scrutiny than ever",
  "text": "<p>With Thursday's presentation about the metaverse, the 37-year-old is now making a bold play as he and his company are under more scrutiny than ever. A Facebook representative couldn't be immediately reached for comment, but in an open letter released Thursday Mr. Zuckerberg called the move \"the beginning of the next chapter for the internet, and it's the next chapter for our company too.\"</p><p>The metaverse, a concept rooted in science-fiction novels like \"Ready Player One\" and \"Snow Crash,\" is an extensive online worldthat would exist across several technology platforms, not just one. People would be able to hang out in immersive, shared digital spaces using avatars that would allow them to virtually attend concerts or try on clothes in stores, just as they would in the real world. And Mr. Zuckerberg wants his company to lead the way, past social media and toward a more expansive vision of how technology can bring people together.</p><p>The chief executive has pushed to reinvent the company every few years, in the process building a tech behemoth valued at nearly $900 billion. Some of his moves proved prescient and enduring, while others were short-lived.</p><p>In 2012, when Facebook was struggling with users' transition to smartphones, Mr. Zuckerberg told his team to give priority to mobile-first products. Anybody who proposed desktop features was promptly kicked out of meetings, he said. That same year, he also bought Instagram, then a fledgling, mobile-first social-media app that allowed users to post filtered photos to share publicly or with friends. The focus on mobile paid off with both advertisers and users, and Instagram gave the company a valuable offering for young people.</p><p>In mid-2016, Facebook attempted a similar pivot to go \"video-first.\" At the time, Mr. Zuckerberg predicted that within five years or so, most of what people consumed online would be video. Facebook spent vast sums of money buying content for its Watch tab and paying celebrities to use its live-video product, in an effort to popularize the content and persuade television advertisers to buy spots on Facebook.</p><p>Facebook changed course again in 2017 after coming under fire for allowing disinformation and hate speech to spread during the 2016 U.S. presidential race. Then, Mr. Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would become the new social infrastructure, with a focus on fortifying connections between users through its features, including Groups.</p><p>He doubled down on that vision in 2019, when he told reporters that Facebook Groups would be at the heart of the app as part of a broader pivot to privacy that would make Facebook feel like a living room, rather than a public square. This shift came just a year after Facebook was accused of allowing political-data firm Cambridge Analytica to improperly access users' data.</p><p>On Monday, while announcing the company's third-quarter earnings report, Mr. Zuckerberg said it would retool its teams to make young adults their \"North Star\" rather than focus on older demographics. He also said Facebook would spend $10 billion to develop the metaverse.</p><p>On Thursday, he expanded on that, spending more than an hour explaining his vision for the metaverse and how he would bring it to life, pulling in his $2 billion acquisition of virtual-reality headset company Oculus from 2014.</p><p>The metaverse announcement comes as the company is facing another scandal, this time related to thousands of internal documents that formed the basis of a series of stories from The Wall Street Journal called \"The Facebook Files.\" The series shows among other things that Facebook was aware of many problems with its apps, including how Instagram harms some teenage girls and the company's algorithms promote social discord.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg didn't discuss the documents at the event.</p><p>\"We're a company that focuses on connecting people. While most other tech companies focus on how people interact with technology, we focus on building technology so people can interact with each other,\" he said. \"Today, we're seen as a social media company. But in our DNA, we're a company that builds technology to connect people, and the metaverse is the next frontier.\"</p><p>Analysts from Evercore Inc., an investment-banking advisory, were optimistic about Facebook's prospects.</p><p>\"We truly believe the company has a shot at building the next computing platform (helps to start with 3B+ users) and that it can be an economically viable business despite knowing very little about what its ultimate form may look like,\" they said in a note Thursday.</p><p>The future of the company will depend on whether Mr. Zuckerberg can pull it off, the analysts said in the note.</p><p>The Facebook CEO, according to people who know him and his public statements, is keenly aware that tech companies can lose focus over time, especially when facing legal and regulatory threats. His mentor, Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, said in 2019 that his \"greatest mistake ever\" was failing to invest more in mobile devices during the company's antitrust woes.</p><p>After focusing on politics much of the past year, Mr. Zuckerberg is refocusing his energy on products or, as he described it on Thursday, \"ecosystems\" for users to inhabit.</p><p>That would fulfill Mr. Zuckerberg's ambition to be less reliant on Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, the two giants that run the dominant operating systems for smartphones.</p><p>The tension with Apple came to a head this year when it rolled out new privacy rules that required apps to ask users whether they would like to share their data and allow them to opt out if desired. The move cut into Facebook's ability to help advertisers track the success of their campaigns.</p><p>With the metaverse, though, Facebook might be able to sidestep Apple entirely.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg said the company has \"learned what it is like to build for other platforms and living under their rules has profoundly shaped my views on the tech industry. Most of all, I've come to believe that the lack of choice and high fees are stifling innovation, stopping people from building new things and holding back the entire internet economy.\"</p><p>From Facebook to Meta</p><p>* What to Know About the Company's Name Change</p><p>* Heard on the Street: Facebook's Four New Letters Won't Spell Alphabet</p><p>* Facebook Changes Company Name to Meta in Focus on Metaverse</p><p>* MVRS, Facebook's New Ticker Symbol, Leaves FAANG in Flux</p><p>* Name Change to Meta Reflects Common Corporate Tactic</p><p>Write to Deepa Seetharaman at Deepa.Seetharaman@wsj.com and Meghan Bobrowsky at Meghan.Bobrowsky@wsj.com</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg's Latest Pivot Is Personal as Well as Strategic</p>",
