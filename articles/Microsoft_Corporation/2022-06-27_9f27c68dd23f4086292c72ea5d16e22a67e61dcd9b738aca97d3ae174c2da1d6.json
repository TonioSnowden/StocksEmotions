  "text": "<p>Donald Trump's plans to take his media business public have suffered a further blow after a federal grand jury issued subpoenas to a blank-cheque company that is set to merge with Trump Media and Technology Group.</p> <p>Digital World Acquisition Corp, the special purpose acquisition company, said in a regulatory filing on Monday that a federal grand jury in New York had issued subpoenas to the company and to each member of its board this month. </p> <p>The subpoenas also demanded documents, including “communications with or about certain individuals”.</p> <p>A federal grand jury is a group of individuals who decide whether a prosecutor has enough evidence to bring legal action. </p> <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is already investigating Digital World, seeking information on whether TMTG and Digital World had discussed a deal before the Spac went public, which is prohibited. </p> <p>Regulators, including US broker-dealer watchdog Finra, are also looking at trading activity in the blank-cheque company before the deal with TMTG was announced. </p> <p>The federal grand jury has also requested information regarding Rocket One Capital, a Miami-based investment firm, which according to LinkedIn is led by Michael Shvartsman. </p> <p>In a separate filing on Monday, Digital World disclosed that Bruce Garelick, a chief strategy officer at Rocket One Capital, resigned from its board of directors on June 22 but did not state a reason. </p> <p>Trump's company, which is led by Devin Nunes, a Republican former chair of the US House intelligence committee, includes a social network called Truth Social, a podcast unit and a streaming business. It expects to receive more than $1bn from its merger with Digital World once the deal is completed. </p> <p>However, the subpoenas threaten to further delay the completion of the transaction, which was announced in October, sending shares in the Spac up from $10 to a peak of $175. They fell 9 per cent to $25.30 on Monday.</p> <p>TMTG launched Truth Social in February with a promise to “stand up to ‘cancel culture' and the ‘self-righteous scolds'.” Digital World has warned that the company's ability to succeed faces risks because of the former US president's history of bankruptcies and failed business ventures. </p> <p>In a statement on TMTG's website, the company acknowledged Monday's filing and said it was “focused on reclaiming the American people's right to free expression”. </p> <p>“Every day, our team works tirelessly to sustain Truth Social's rapid growth, onboard new users, and add new features. We encourage — and will co-operate with — oversight that supports the SEC's important mission of protecting retail investors,” it added. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/164af947-8b4f-4f9e-b6de-fec8e6b568aa.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Ortenca Aliaj in New York and Oliver Ralph in London 2022 'Donald Trump's plans for Spac deal suffer further blow after subpoenas' FT.com 27 June.
