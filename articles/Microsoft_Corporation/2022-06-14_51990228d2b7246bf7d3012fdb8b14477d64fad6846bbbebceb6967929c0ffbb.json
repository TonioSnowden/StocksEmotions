  "text": "<p>Many others seem to agree. Launched in May 2021, the game is played by thousands of people on Steam, an online game platform, at any given moment. (It is arriving on Xbox and Windows devices in July.) Users spend hours digitally cleaning grimy objects or locations, including subway stations and skate parks. The activity provides both mental absorption and the satisfaction that comes with completing a task.</p><p>The uncertainty and strain wrought by the pandemic made such low-stakes diversions increasingly appealing. James Marsden, the co-chief executive of FuturLab, which developed “PowerWash Simulator”, remembers how the idea came about. In the early days of lockdown his partner “was watching a lot of power-wash videos on YouTube because they helped her de-stress”, he says.</p><p>Mundane chores or professions are now the basis for a number of successful games, including “Best Forklift Operator”, “Espresso Tycoon” and “Gas Station Simulator”. “Job Simulator” (pictured below), a virtual-reality experience, was released in 2019 and has sold more than 1m copies to date. Players are placed in working environments and then given simple tasks to do, such as making a slice of toast or stamping pieces of paper.</p><p>Andrew Eiche, the chief operating officer at Owlchemy Labs, which made “Job Simulator”, says the familiarity is part of the fun. “When we started developing the game, we tried simulating astronaut jobs and high-rise window-washers. But they were never as compelling as the more familiar locations.” Workplaces “are normally rigid environments. But in the game you go into a childlike mode of behaviour. You start throwing things around just to see what happens.”</p><p>“Gas Station Simulator”, meanwhile, gives the player control of a petrol station somewhere in rural America: it is a planning and building initiative akin to “SimCity” and “Railroad Tycoon”, but on a much smaller scale. At the beginning of the game, the station is little more than a shack, but by diligently serving customers and fixing up cars, the player can earn enough income to turn the business into a success and personalise the outpost to their own taste. The game has sold almost half a million copies since its launch in September 2021.</p><p>Karol Sasorski, a brand manager at Drago Entertainment, which is behind “Gas Station Simulator”, says that, as with many other games, players enjoy having firm goals and the personal autonomy to achieve them. “In real life, managing a gas station is not much fun and is probably stressful,” he suggests. “But this game gives players a chance to enjoy the best parts, which is being their own boss, personalising their workplace and choosing how they want to run their business without any interference.” He said that the company's next project will be a food-truck simulator.</p><p>Users' willingness to spend their free time completing tasks they might ordinarily avoid may seem strange. But gaming companies have identified the best part of work—creative achievement—and placed it within the context of trusted gameplay styles such as shooting, strategising or merely manipulating objects. The concept recognises that working without the bother of deadlines or micromanagement can be a lot of fun.</p><p>It is even therapeutic. According to Mr Marsden, lovers of “PowerWash Simulator” say “the game helps them cope with stress and anxiety. It just feels good to wash away all those pixels and turn something filthy into something shiny and clean.” FuturLab is collaborating with Oxford University on a study which uses “PowerWash Simulator” to better understand how games can soothe players, particularly those struggling with mental-health problems. Mr Eiche says the prosaic format is in its own way an escape. “In tumultuous times, people take solace in simple things. When you're inundated with horrific news every day, there's a lot to be said for pretending to be a cook in a silly world.”</p><p>■</p>",
