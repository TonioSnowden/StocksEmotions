  "title": "Google's  Tepid  Results  Fuel Tech  Anxiety  ---  Parent company  Alphabet's revenue  climbed at lowest rate  in more than two years  ----  By Miles Kruppa",
  "text": "<p>   Google reported its fifth consecutive quarter of slowing sales growth, with its YouTube video platform posting a drop in advertising revenue for the first time since the company began disclosing the unit's performance. </p><p>   The results show weakness in the economy spreading to some of its more resilient names, including many tech companies that saw their sales and stock prices rise during the pandemic. Microsoft Corp. reported on Tuesday its worst quarterly earnings in more than two years, and Texas Instruments Inc. said it was seeing flagging demand in personal electronics and from some industrial buyers. </p><p>   The Google results point to continued fragility for the digital-advertising industry, which has been clobbered in recent months. Some of Google's core properties, including YouTube and search, which have long been drivers of the company's overall performance, showed surprising weakness. </p><p>    Alphabet Inc., Google's parent company, reported revenue of $69.1 billion for the third quarter, an increase of 6.1% from the year-earlier period but less than analysts expected. </p><p>   At a time when the company's executives have talked about becoming more disciplined in hiring, Alphabet's full-time employee base increased by almost 12,800 workers in the quarter, the biggest change on record. Alphabet shares fell after hours. </p><p>   \"Times like this are clarifying,\" said CEO Sundar Pichai, in a call with analysts after earnings were announced. He said that Google has begun a push to become more efficient \"by realigning resources to invest in our biggest growth opportunities\" and that employee growth will be significantly lower in the fourth quarter. </p><p>   While Google has attempted to become less reliant on advertising in recent years, the tech company still makes the majority of its revenue from ads that appear next to search results and videos surfaced by the company's algorithms. </p><p>   Alphabet's revenue growth in the third quarter was the company's lowest since the second quarter of 2020, when the company lost business as the coronavirus stoked fears among advertisers. Sales rose 41% in last year's third quarter, by comparison. </p><p>   Google has recently pushed big brands toward a suite of automated tools for purchasing advertising across the company's own properties and other online publishers, a move analysts have credited with boosting the core search-advertising business. </p><p>   The search business posted revenue of $39.5 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 4.3%. </p><p>   Because search has historically been such a consistent performer, \"this is a weak result,\" said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at Evercore ISI. He added that it is \"probably a very good indicator of expanding caution and weakness among small business marketers.\" </p><p>   Advertising revenue on Google's YouTube video platform fell 1.9% to $7.1 billion, the first time sales have dropped since Alphabet began reporting the unit's financial performance in 2020. YouTube relies more heavily on so-called brand advertising than other parts of Google's business, making it more susceptible to the pullback in spending. </p><p>   The broader economic slowdown has prompted Mr. Pichai to search for ways to improve the company's bottom line after a boost in fortunes during the pandemic spurred a period of breakneck expansion. </p><p>   Mr. Pichai said in July that Google would slow hiring for the rest of the year and last month said the company should become 20% more productive, without providing details on how he would measure the improvements. </p><p>   Last month, Google scaled back spending at an internal startup incubator and shut down its streaming videogame service Stadia, a product Mr. Pichai introduced with a big marketing push in 2019. </p><p>   Revenue in Google's cloud-computing division, one of its biggest areas of spending, increased by 37.6% to $6.9 billion, growing slightly faster than in this year's second quarter. </p><p>   Alphabet reported $13.9 billion in net income for the third quarter, a decrease of 26.5% compared with the year-earlier period. At market open on Tuesday, shares of the company had fallen about 30% since the beginning of the year, slightly less than the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index and other major online-advertising companies. </p><p></p>",
