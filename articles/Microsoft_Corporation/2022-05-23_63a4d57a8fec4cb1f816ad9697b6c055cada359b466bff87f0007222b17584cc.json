  "text": "<p>As an aspiring cartoonist and budding bullet-journal note taker, I decided to test the top offerings. Here's which tablets and styluses -- don't say \"styli\"! -- are best for drawing and note-taking.</p><p>Microsoft Slim Pen 2 for Surface Devices</p><p>Price: $119</p><p>Works with: Various Microsoft Surface Pro tablets and other devices</p><p>Pros: The Surface Slim Pen 2's flat-edged design, weighty heft and extra-fine pen tip make it stand out among its pointed peers. Plus, it won't roll off your desk and charges magnetically.</p><p>The Surface can run pro-grade Windows-compatible design apps, like Photoshop and Illustrator. It has consumer-friendly options such as the free-to-try (but $24.99 to buy) Sketchable: It even lets you export to Photoshop.</p><p>Cons: The Slim Pen 2 sometimes faltered when I had a very light touch, causing awkward transitions between thin and thick lines.</p><p>Samsung S Pen for Galaxy Tabs and Phones</p><p>Price: Included with some Galaxy tablets; $60 to replace</p><p>Works with: Various Samsung Galaxy Tabs (plus some premium Galaxy smartphones)</p><p>Pros: In some apps, especially Samsung's own Notes app, the S Pen writes the most like a pen. The S Pen's soft marker-style tip makes it fun to write with and is the quietest of all styluses tested. The S Pen works with other large-screen Galaxy smartphones, including the Z Fold3 and S22 Ultra.</p><p>Cons: The pen itself feels like something you'd get to keep score at minigolf. That can make it uncomfortable to hold for extended use. Also, the tips wear down quickly, and Samsung doesn't offer replacements. You can find off-brand replacement parts at Amazon and elsewhere.</p><p>An even bigger liability is that the Android app ecosystem lacks the professional software options of iPadOS and Windows.</p><p>Apple Pencil 2 for iPad</p><p>Price: $129</p><p>Works with: The most recent iPad Air, Mini and Pro models</p><p>Pros: The Apple Pencil 2 features a flat edge so it isn't constantly rolling off tables like its round predecessor. Its soft matte finish feels great.</p><p>The Apple Pencil 2 had the best pressure sensitivity of all styluses tested. The lines are straight, with no wobble or jitter, and when you add more or less pressure while drawing, the ink flow responds accordingly without getting blotchy.</p><p>Software-wise, the $9.99 Procreate is the amateur artist's ace in the hole. The app is easy to use while giving a high level of control and customization.</p><p>Cons: Want to charge your Pencil 2? It wirelessly charges by attaching to the side of compatible iPads. There's no cable-based, plug-in-the-wall option.</p><p>It's also noisy. Plus, the double-tap function, which allows users to change a tool or perform a function by lightly tapping the device, can easily be triggered accidentally.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
