Even if the final decision goes in favour of the fund — Brussels is confident it can still get all national ratifications by June — the delay can only unsettle investors.</p> <p>Dissatisfaction with the European response to the pandemic is best exemplified by the growing mood of crisis in Germany, detailed in today's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc5a3b02-a90d-4206-a441-1bada29feba2\">Big Read</a>. Government policy increasingly feels chaotic — illustrated by another twist in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e1774a8-2e22-4d20-a31d-b83e47e8b880\">AstraZeneca vaccine</a> story yesterday, with the jab now restricted to the over-60s because of concerns about potential blood clots.</p> <p>Investors are also grappling with the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8392656e-8362-4f27-b6c8-394b28a4c16f\">higher inflation</a> in the eurozone. New data today showed a rise to 1.3 per cent in March, the highest level since the start of the pandemic. European Central Bank chief Christine Lagarde said, however, this was unlikely to be sustained and any tightening of monetary policy remained distant.</p> <p>Still, many feel the EU response, and in particular the recovery fund, is inadequate to deal with the fallout from the crisis. And unless European governments match the commitment of the US with its $1.9tn stimulus plan, there remains the risk of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. </p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p>Final figures for 2020 confirmed the <strong>UK economy</strong> shrank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1660c16d-a334-4334-8285-18c8d5842910\">9.8 per cent</a> — the biggest drop in 300 years — but grew more than previously thought in the second half of the year. High household savings data boost hopes that consumer spending will fuel recovery once the economy reopens.</p> <p><strong>Brazil</strong>, home to more new coronavirus cases than any other country, is facing a mounting crisis as opposition grows to president <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e64ec27-7c9f-44cc-9de9-c7c358ee7447\">Jair Bolsonaro</a> and his stance on vaccinations, lockdowns and mask-wearing.</p> <p><strong>Ireland</strong> is using the “unparalleled opportunity” of the pandemic to address the country's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/445790e4-86bc-4697-be0d-5372044cd52b\">urban/rural divide</a> by encouraging city workers to move to rural areas and operate remotely. Its plans include a network of more than 400 remote working hubs and new tax breaks to encourage the move.</p> <h2>Business</h2> <p><strong>Deliveroo</strong> shares slumped 30 per cent this morning as the food delivery company made its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5028437e-accf-4624-8ecd-2b502d04743d\">stock market debut</a> in London, raising questions about the UK's prospects of attracting high-growth tech companies. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5725a4cf-4bff-4b4a-bb04-957a77d2ee92\">FT Lex column</a> dissects the reasons for the flop. </p> <p><strong>Lloyd's of London</strong> experienced its worst underwriting result in three years as coronavirus-related claims <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75ce339e-2586-46fd-ae96-1c3e2df24875\">topped £6bn</a>. The insurance market was also hit by a string of natural disasters and political turbulence from Brexit. </p> <p>Sweden's <strong>Hennes &amp; Mauritz</strong> became the latest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e7c3f5a-ad14-4fea-aed3-a20d4015d503\">clothing retailer</a> to detail damage from the pandemic, reporting a loss in the three months to the end of February as more than a third of its stores worldwide were shut due to lockdowns. <strong>Otrium</strong>, a Dutch start-up, hopes to take advantage of the situation to build an online <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fc48c36-aa6d-4a4e-9340-6a540f98d9d4\">“designer outlet”</a> — analogous to the UK's Bicester Village or Woodbury Common in New York — to sell unsold items from premium brands. </p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p>A speech by US president <strong>Joe Biden</strong> later today on infrastructure spending and corporate tax rises could cause further turbulence in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7a93cb5-f9f1-485a-8b39-1e7a12a97790\">bond markets</a>. Yields on US 10-year <strong>Treasury bonds</strong> yesterday hit their highest levels since January 2020 as a turbulent trading quarter for government debt neared its end. </p> <p>IMF chief <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/487c30f4-7f21-4787-b519-dde52264d141\">Kristalina Georgieva</a> added to warnings of a looming debt crisis in <strong>emerging markets</strong> as the economic recovery in richer countries draws capital away and sectors crucial to poorer countries such as tourism face only a slow return to pre-pandemic levels. </p> <p>Carbon emissions may have dropped during the coronavirus crisis but <strong>methane pollution</strong> — which can have up to 80 times the warming effect of carbon dioxide — in the US is now back at pre-pandemic levels as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/667cd344-a222-4002-9e2a-dce13d669d33\">shale drilling</a> resumes, encouraged by rising oil prices. </p> <h2>Have your say</h2> <p>Mr Pink comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e65b3764-2da7-48dd-9683-4239c68ad57b?commentID=b262702b-c292-4d6d-b759-4d515d629986\">UK ministers weigh Covid certificates for offices</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>There is a massive age difference when you look at who is keen to go back to the office and who would rather work from home. A number of senior politicians who oppose it are 35 or older, already have a family and kids and a nice big house and aren't in any rush to go back. Anecdotally, most of the people I know under the age of 35 are desperate to be able to go back, given they generally live in small flats with limited access to a garden or outside space and probably do actually enjoy the social contact that comes with being in an office.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p>Watch: Bill Gates spoke to FT editor Roula Khalaf at our Climate Capital Live summit yesterday . You can also watch Roula interviewing Jane Fonda and find a wide range of other material via our new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/climate-capital\">Climate Capital</a> hub. </p> <p><em>We would really like to hear from you.
