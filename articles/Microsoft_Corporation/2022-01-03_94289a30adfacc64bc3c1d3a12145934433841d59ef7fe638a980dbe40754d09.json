  "title": "Technology:  Electronics Show Offers Tech Trends  To Look for in an Unusual Year  ----  By Shara Tibken and Dalvin Brown",
  "text": "<p>\n  Nothing about this year's CES will be normal. That includes some of the biggest trends expected at the show. </p><p>\n  The annual tech conference, which took place online last year, kicks off Monday with in-person press events in Las Vegas. Despite the surge of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the event's organizer, the Consumer Technology Association, said it would proceed but end a day early. The organization expects up to 75,000 attendees and over 2,200 exhibitors, including Samsung Electronics Co. and Sony Group Corp. </p><p>\n  Event mainstays such as Intel Corp., Lenovo Group Ltd., LG Electronics Inc. and Panasonic Corp. have withdrawn or greatly reduced in-person staffing, and the biggest tech firms, including Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc., have decided to stay home. </p><p>\n  Here is what is expected to be on tap for this year. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Getting comfy at home </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  We have spent two years mostly hanging out at home, and tech companies took notice. They are introducing products designed to help users relax and decompress when they aren't at a computer. They have designed smart beds that can nudge you when it is time to wake up, bathtubs that maintain consistent water temperature and air purifiers that also add fragrances to a room. </p><p>\n  Developers are focusing on sensor-assisted products like lamps, toilets and bathtubs that respond based on time of day, air quality or who is in the room. </p><p>\n  Bemis Manufacturing Co. will show off a new line of smart air purifiers designed to adjust automatically to indoor air quality and emit essential-oil aromas. At night, the gadgets sense that the lights are lowered, and reduce noise so you can sleep. </p><p>\n   Sleep Number Corp. and Sleepme Inc. are among the companies unveiling next-generation bed tech with more-advanced sensing and response capabilities for adults. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Taking care of kids and parents </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  CES 2022 will have plenty of tech for the so-called sandwich generation, adults who care for both their kids and their parents: an AI-equipped baby monitor that can detect a covered face or a rollover, room sensors to track the movement of seniors, and health and activity wearables designed to meet the needs of every age group. </p><p>\n  Florida-based CarePredict Inc. will show off an update to its wrist-worn Tempo that makes it easier for caregivers to communicate with their older loved ones (or make sure they are properly cared for). The new CareVoice feature lets people send audio messages to the watch wearer, whether it is greetings from a grandchild or a reminder to take medicine. </p><p>\n  \"It really is a human touch, even when you're not there,\" CEO Satish Movva said. </p><p>\n  The device detects falls and can send an alert when its wearer skips meals, sleeps less or has other activity out of the norm. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Saving the planet </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Some of the products being shown at CES include a hydrogen fuel-cell-powered flying car concept from French company Maca, and a tabletop washer from another French firm, Auum, designed to cut down on single-use plastic by cleaning and drying a glass in 10 seconds. </p><p>\n   From the Netherlands, RanMarine Technology will show off WasteShark, a floating autonomous drone that cleans pollution from waterways and collects data on water quality. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Cooking and eating </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  This year at the show, a half-day food-tech conference will showcase advances in areas such as agriculture, ingredient innovation, meal kits and deliveries, vertical farming and plant-based meat. Impossible Foods will be there, as will MycoTechnology, which will debut a meat alternative made from fungi. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Looking ahead </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The metaverse is a hot topic right now. Hyundai Motor Group will allow visitors to create avatars and test drive new concept cars in cyberspace. The startup Bhaptics will demo gaming gloves designed to replace hand-held VR controllers. Samsung is marketing its metaverse ambitions with a VR home-decorating platform. </p><p>\n  And the conference is hosting a new program to discuss nonfungible tokens (aka NFTs), virtual certificates that show you own a digital object. </p><p></p>",
