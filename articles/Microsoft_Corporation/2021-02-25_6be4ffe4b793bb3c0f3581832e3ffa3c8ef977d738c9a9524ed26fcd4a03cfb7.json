  "text": "<p>Friday will mark <a href=\"https://fundcentres.legalandgeneral.com/uk/Private/fund-centre/Unit-Trust/Future-World-Gender-in-Leadership-UK-Index-Fund/#Performance\">the end</a> of what was supposed to be an inspiring story. The Legal &amp; General Future World Gender in Leadership UK Index fund, known as the Girl fund, has failed to attract inflows and its remaining assets, which amounted to just £6.1m on February 23, will be folded into a broad LGIM “sustainable” index fund.</p> <p>“While we were very proud of what the Future World Girl Fund has achieved, including the awareness that it generated around a very important topic, this fund and thematic strategy did not see the level of investor inflows originally expected,” LGIM said in a statement.</p> <p>Sadly, Girl, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32790038-59c4-11e8-bdb7-f6677d2e1ce8\">which launched</a> to great fanfare in May 2018, has not been the only gender fund to have disappointed proponents of investing according to principles that promote gender equality in the workforce.</p> <p>While Morningstar found assets in active and passive gender funds — which select companies according to metrics such as the proportion of women in leadership and the adoption of female-friendly policies such as flexible working — more than quadrupled to $3bn globally over the three years to the end of January, they collectively underperformed their respective wider capitalisation-weighted benchmarks such as the S&amp;P 500.</p> <p>Only one of nine gender funds globally outperformed the appropriate index over this period — the Axa fund shown in the chart.</p> <p>Morningstar data also reveal that only one in six passive gender funds in the US and Europe (where most gender funds are domiciled) have outperformed their relevant broad-market benchmark since inception.</p> <p>Even during 2020, when funds following a broader environmental, social and governance strategy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e9f8204-83bf-4217-bc9e-d89396279c5b\">outperformed</a>, gender funds disappointed.</p> <p>“Just seven of the 21 gender strategies we have identified in our global database survived and outperformed their respective benchmarks in 2020,” said Kenneth Lamont, senior fund analyst for passive funds research at Morningstar Europe. </p> <p>“On average these funds, which adopt a range of approaches and target different geographic areas lagged their benchmarks by 2.4 percentage points over the year,” he added. </p> <p>The performance has been in marked contrast to the claims often made when the products launched. For example, when Barclays unveiled its Women in Leadership exchange traded note (WIL) in 2014, its marketing material cited “a growing body of third-party research” that suggested “gender-diverse leadership may correlate with relatively stronger corporate performance, as compared to companies with less gender-diverse leadership”. </p> <p>Lamont said his research shows the ETN went on to lag the Russell 1000 index by more than 4 percentage points on an annualised basis since then.</p> <p>Similarly, the SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE), <a href=\"https://www.ssga.com/investment-topics/general-investing/2018/04/drive_change_gender_diversity.pdf\">cites research</a> by index provider MSCI that says it found a “36.4 per cent higher return on equity for companies with strong female leadership compared to companies without a critical mass of women at the top”. </p> <p>This ETF has garnered a <a href=\"https://www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-ssga-gender-diversity-index-etf-she\">healthy $204m</a> in assets under management, as of February 22, and delivered its investors a <a href=\"https://www.trackinsight.com/en/fund/US78468R7474?utm_source=ft&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=etf.ft.com\">return of 17.95 per cent</a> in 2020.</p> <p>However, early investors, who might have been attracted by its spectacular marketing stunts such as its placement of the Fearless Girl statue on Wall Street in March 2017, would have been better off investing in a wider index fund. Morningstar research shows SHE has lagged the S&amp;P 500 by 1.7 percentage points on an annualised basis since its inception in 2016.</p> <p>Diana van Maasdijk, chief executive of Equileap, the most widely used provider of investment data on gender equality in the workplace, said the calculations by Morningstar were “not 100 per cent accurate” because Morningstar had measured the funds' performance against broad cap-weighted indices, whereas gender lens indices tended to be equal weighted. When compared to equal-weighted indices from 2011 to 2020, Equileap indices outperformed “systematically”, Equileap said.</p> <p>Van Maasdijk pointed to Morningstar's additional findings that the funds were particularly underweight in technology stocks compared to their wider cap-weighted benchmarks. </p> <p>“Looking at the market now, [gender lens investing] represents an interesting way to diversify one's portfolio, in particular in the United States. The S&amp;P 500's performance has indeed mostly been driven by a handful of tech giants, while gender equality indices are significantly more diversified,” van Maasdijk said.</p> <p>She said Equileap looked at a number of metrics including female representation at all levels of a company, the gender pay gap, parental leave and anti-sexual harassment policies.</p> <p>Deborah Fuhr, founder of ETFGI, a data provider, said it was unsurprising that gender funds were underweight in tech. “Think of the challenges of getting girls to do maths and sciences,” she said. However, she added: “I think there is still a case for arguing that companies need to be better governed.”</p> <p>The question of exposure to US technology stocks could well be a large part of the underperformance story. Impact Shares YWCA Women's Empowerment ETF (<a href=\"https://www.trackinsight.com/en/fund/US45259A1007?utm_source=ft&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=etf.ft.com\">WOMN</a>) had an exposure of more than 35 per cent to IT stocks at the end of December 2020 with its top 15 holdings including names such as Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple. In that year it also delivered investors returns of 34 per cent.</p> <p>Despite their aggregate failure to deliver outperformance in the short term, Lamont said that did not mean the funds were fated to continue in the same vein nor that the investment choice was a bad idea. “I'm not saying that this [gender lens] strategy will not work at some time in the future, or that you should not use these funds to express your views,” he said. </p>&#xa0;<p>Source: Emma Boyde 2021 'Gender funds collectively underperform the wider market, data show' FT.com 25 February.
