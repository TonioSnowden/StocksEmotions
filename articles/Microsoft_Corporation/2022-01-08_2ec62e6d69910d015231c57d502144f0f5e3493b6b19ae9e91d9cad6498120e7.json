  "title": "REVIEW --- Icons: Artists at Work in a New Year --- Six contemporary artists discuss their plans to address the pandemic and more in 2022.",
  "text": "<p>In 2022, Mr. Lozano-Hemmer's work will focus on Earth's atmosphere as something \"fragile, something we need to think of as precious,\" he said. A new immersive exhibition, \"Atmospheric Memory,\" will tour U.S. and Canadian venues after opening last month at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. The interactive exhibition includes a voice-controlled fountain that inscribes ephemeral words in mid-air using water vapor. \"This intimacy that we all share, this biosphere, is one of the lessons of the pandemic,\" Mr. Lozano-Hemmer said.</p><p>In the first months of the pandemic, Cauleen Smith launched \"COVID MANIFESTO,\" a series of photographs, short films and social media posts reflecting on a world in crisis. In these images, Ms. Smith's handwritten statements, such as \"We all deserve better than 'back to normal,'\" appear amid eye-catching arrangements of fruit, flowers, glowing candles, African sculptures and other objects. \"Pandemic Diaries,\" an exhibition on view through Sept. 6 at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, features outsize images from the series projected in the museum's lobby, as well as an online exhibition of all 23 manifestos as a single film. \"We are living through such dramatic human histories right now,\" Ms. Smith said. \"It's hard to be a person on this planet and not be very concerned with the way we humans are taking care of the Earth and each other.\"</p><p>Having to install complicated exhibitions via Skype \"catapulted me to my afterlife,\" said Pipilotti Rist. Prevented from being there in person due to Covid travel limitations, Ms. Rist and her team created detailed manuals enabling museums to set up her installations \"without me/us and when I am dead,\" as she put it. Her show \"Big Heartedness, Be My Neighbor,\" on view through June 6 at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, surveys some 30 years of Ms. Rist's playful, evocative work, from an oversize chandelier made of underpants to a video projected onto a rumpled bed. This year, Ms. Rist is researching the use of artificial light in different civilizations, with an eye toward creating works that address \"planetarian, psychological and light problems\" and explore ways to \"use less light more effectively and beneficially.\"</p><p>Julie Mehretu spent much of last year \"chaperoning\" a major retrospective of her work, which is currently on view at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis after runs at the Whitney Museum of American Art and other museums. In 2022 she plans to delve further into an approach she developed in the first months of the pandemic, creating paintings where \"there's no mark-making that's done with a brush,\" but rather with \"airbrush and erasure.\" These works \"operate almost like ghosts,\" Ms. Mehretu says. \"Part of what I'm trying to push in this newer work,\" she explains, is \"how to make parts of the painting even more ephemeral and maybe even disappear in space\" when seen from different angles. \"And maybe not,\" she added with a laugh. \"It's in the really, really early stages of experimenting.\"</p><p>For Frank Stella, the focus in 2022 will be on finishing a series of sculptures inspired by rivers. The works, he explains, are really \"about my father,\" an avid angler who spent time salmon-fishing in Newfoundland and Quebec. The first full-scale sculpture -- a tumult of bright, undulating steel ribbons and sheets -- made its way to New York last month after some delays, shipped from the fabrication site in the Netherlands, where other works in the series are in process.</p><p>Finally, the pioneering media and performance artist Joan Jonas, whose work mixes large-screen video with sculptural installations and tableaux, will spend this year preparing for a 2024 MoMA survey of her six-decade career. Three major works are currently on view at Dia Beacon in upstate New York, and in April, Ms. Jonas will present a \"very small performance,\" already sold out, at the Park Avenue Armory in New York. She describes it as \"the first version of something -- a work in progress\" that will later appear in finished form. \"We live in a very difficult world,\" she observed, adding that for her, art is \"the one hopeful and important activity.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
