  "text": "<p>    Lithium Americas Corp., a Canadian mining company, in January raised $400 million, part of which it said will help fund a Nevada project to extract lithium from clay deposits. </p><p>   Albemarle said it's considering reopening some long-mothballed lithium mining assets in Kings Mountain, N.C. Eric Norris, president of Albemarle's lithium business, said the company has spent more than $30 million over the past few years to assess the area. It is investing between $30 million and $50 million to expand production at a project in Nevada. </p><p>   Investors including Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and a fund run by Bill Gates are also backing companies seeking new ways to extract lithium as part of a global rush of firms trying to break into the sector. </p><p>   There is no public market to bet on higher lithium prices in the future like there is for commodities like oil and gold, so investors have bet on the stocks of lithium miners. Shares have been volatile lately as investors retreat from hot stocks tied to electric cars, but Albemarle has still gained more than 60% since the end of September. Shares of Livent have added nearly 90%. The market value of Lithium Americas, which is also trying to produce in Argentina, approached $3 billion in January before a recent retreat. </p><p>   One risk to lithium miners is that demand doesn't materialize, or a new battery technology reduces the amount of lithium needed. </p><p>   \"You can still paint a lot of scenarios in both directions,\" said Mathew Lazarus, managing member at New York-based hedge fund Red Hook Asset Management LLC, who invests in lithium companies. </p><p>   Mr. Arima of Piedmont Lithium said he isn't concerned. As competition among nations for control of the lithium-ion battery supply chain ramps up, he expects more resources, and investors, to pour in. </p><p>   \"We need to do it here in America,\" he said. \"It's part of our future. We can't rely on overseas supply chains.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Micah Maidenberg contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
