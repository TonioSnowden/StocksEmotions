  "text": "<p>Top executives at an Austrian packaging company are alleged to have embezzled millions of euros and committed accounting fraud, stunning investors that lent the group nearly €500mn less than six months ago.</p> <p>Schur Flexibles, which was valued at €900mn in an October buyout deal, told its lenders last week that its former chief executive and finance director may have misappropriated company funds for their personal benefit, including leasing “luxury apartments” in London's Mayfair.</p> <p>The alleged financial impropriety was discovered by Austrian investment group B&amp;C-Gruppe, which acquired an 80 per cent stake in Schur last year.</p> <p>B&amp;C quickly noticed signs of lavish spending by the senior executives, according to two people briefed on the matter. It dismissed Schur's chief executive and finance director in December and appointed consultancy firm Alvarez &amp; Marsal to conduct a review.</p> <p>Schur, which produces flexible packaging for food and pharmaceutical products, disclosed the alleged fraud in a summary of the preliminary findings of that review, according to several people familiar with the matter. </p> <p>The review also alleged “various indications of potential manipulation of financial statements” in emails from Schur's former chief executive and finance director, dating from 2019 to 2021. While the company's revenue and cash position appears to have been accurately reported, the company told its lenders that its ebitda was seemingly improperly inflated by tens of millions of euros, according to the people.</p> <p>PwC Austria, which audited the company's financial statements, declined to comment. Schur also declined to comment.</p> <p>The allegations have shocked investors in Europe's leveraged loan market, in which funds lend money to higher-risk companies. </p> <p>In September, JPMorgan led a loan deal, alongside Citigroup and UniCredit, in which the US bank convinced scores of investment funds to lend €475mn to Schur.</p> <p>One lender described the situation as a “total shambles” and questioned how EY — which carried out financial due diligence for Schur's new owner last year — failed to spot alleged signs of apparent widespread fraud.</p> <p>Schur's loans were quoted at around 80 cents on the euro on Friday, suggesting lenders are braced for steep losses.</p> <p>JPMorgan, Citigroup, UniCredit and EY Austria all declined to comment. </p> <p>B&amp;C bought the stake in Schur from US private equity firm Lindsay Goldberg weeks after the loan deal closed. The New York-based private equity firm, which had owned Schur since 2016, retained a 20 per cent stake.</p> <p>B&amp;C told the Financial Times that “suspicions of serious compliance violations by the former management have come to light” that have prompted Schur to take “legal action”.</p> <p>“In addition to compliance misconduct, significant inconsistencies in the historical audited financial statements of Schur Flexibles during the period of the sole ownership of Lindsay Goldberg are also being investigated,” B&amp;C said, adding that the company is also reviewing whether to continue the mandate of its existing auditor.</p> <p>B&amp;C added that it was “confident that Lindsay Goldberg will fulfil its responsibility as former main owner and current co-owner towards Schur Flexibles.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Lindsay Goldberg told the FT it was “not aware of any alleged accounting irregularities or fraudulent activities”.</p> <p>“LG fully supports any investigation to clarify the allegations,” the US private equity firm said. “LG also supports every possible action to pursue justice and accountability. As a minority shareholder, LG is engaged in constructive discussions with the other shareholders, the management and the lenders.”</p> <p>In its summary of Alvarez &amp; Marsal's findings given to lenders, B&amp;C disclosed that €4mn of company money was “most likely” misappropriated by Schur's former chief executive through his “private account” last year. </p> <p>The findings, which did not name the two executives, said the former CEO billed “excessive business travel costs and hospitalities” to the company, made “excessive payments to several employees in 2021 without any contractual basis”, and engaged in “potentially fraudulent spending on consultants”.</p> <p>Schur's former chief executive did not respond to an email and LinkedIn message requesting comment. Its former finance director could not be reached for comment.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Kaye Wiggins and Michael O'Dwyer</em></p><p>Source: Robert Smith 2022 'Fraud and embezzlement allegations at Austrian group stun investors' FT.com 28 February.
