  "title": "World News: Economic Woes Close U.K. Businesses",
  "text": "<p>Governments have tried to support companies by capping energy bills in some places. Germany and France have nationalized two big utilities weighed down by soaring prices.</p><p>In the U.K., a wave of business closures is washing over the country amid the economic pressure. Trapped between surging costs and weakening customer demand, cafes, bakeries, breweries, bookstores and pubs have been closing.</p><p>More than a quarter of a million U.K. companies stopped trading in the first half of this year -- 16% more than in the first half of 2021 and 40% more than in the first six months of prepandemic 2019, according to the Office of National Statistics. It was the largest number recorded in a six-month period, the ONS said.</p><p>Data on business closures in the July-to-September quarter won't be released until later this month, but many analysts expect the failure rate to have accelerated.</p><p>Most of those closures are small businesses. The ONS numbers don't break down the size of companies shutting. But 95% of the U.K.'s 5.6 million companies in 2021 had nine employees or fewer, according to the U.K. Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.</p><p>Numbers are difficult to compare across borders, but bankruptcies -- a subset of business closures generally -- haven't increased notably in much of the rest of the continent, eurozone data show. In France, which has reported numbers similar to those in the U.K., 183,530 businesses closed in the first six months of the year, up roughly a third compared with the first half of 2021, according to data from French commercial courts.</p><p>U.K. businesses recently have been put under fresh strain closer to home. A surprisingly large tax-cutting package announced by the government last month roiled markets, further clouding the outlook for executives and business owners.</p><p>British consumers have stopped buying many nonessentials, executives say. Anxious customers are delaying big-ticket purchases, such as cars, furniture and costly vacations.</p><p>Consumer confidence in the U.K. fell in September to the weakest level since data company GfK started tracking it in 1974. \"Consumers are buckling under the pressure of the U.K.'s growing cost-of-living crisis,\" said Joe Staton, the company's client-strategy director. Consumer confidence in the European Union also hit a low, the European Commission said last week.</p><p>Businesses were hurting before the Russia-Ukraine war. The pandemic strained many enterprises, though government financial support was a lifeline for some. After Covid-19 restrictions were lifted, soaring demand and hobbled supply lines started to stoke prices. The war, however, has put that inflationary pressure into overdrive in the U.K.</p><p>\"Trade is just too uncertain,\" Glasgow-based bookshop Outwith Books said when announcing its closure last month. In Leeds, brewery Nomadic Beers said it was unable to continue because of the \"increasing costs of everything from utilities to ingredients.\" The Station Masters, a fish-and-chip shop in the northern English town of Bingley, said it was being forced to shut by rising food costs and energy bills.</p><p>Other companies are taking significant steps to hunker down. BrewDog PLC said last month that it was shutting six U.K. pubs because of rising costs. \"If nothing happens, the U.K. looks set to lose half of its pubs and bars,\" James Watt, the brewer's chief executive, wrote in a LinkedIn post.</p><p>Those still operating face the prospect of even-weaker consumer demand, as the Bank of England raises interest rates to combat inflation. That threatens to cut into household finances by increasing mortgage repayments and credit-card bills.</p><p>Having battled through the pandemic, Eve Sleep PLC Chief Executive Cheryl Calverley was planning on a strong recovery in 2022. The bedding company was forecasting sales of its mattresses to rise by a third from the previous year.</p><p>\"Then Russia invaded Ukraine,\" said Ms. Calverley, \"and everything went off a cliff.\" Costs, chiefly for components for products such as mattresses and bed frames, were already climbing last year. After the start of the war, energy costs rose, too.</p><p>Ms. Calverley said her customers have been facing soaring bills, so they have stopped spending money on other things. Eve Sleep's sales declined 16% in the first half of 2022. The company cut staff from 60 to 30. Cash has dwindled to GBP 1 million, equivalent to $1.1 million, at the end of August, down from GBP 5.2 million at the end of June 2021. She is seeking a buyer or investor.</p><p>\"The middle class has lost the confidence to spend,\" Ms. Calverley added.</p>",
