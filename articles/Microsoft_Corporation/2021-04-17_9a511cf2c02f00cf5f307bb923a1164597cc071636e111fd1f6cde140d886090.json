  "title": "REVIEW  ---  Weekend Confidential:  Jory Fleming  ---  A Rhodes Scholar with autism often feels like he's on his own small  island, but works to build bridges to the neurotypical mainland.  ----  By Emily Bobrow",
  "text": "<p>   When meeting someone for the first time, Jory Fleming doesn't like to mention that he has autism. He's noticed that people tend to act surprised, which he believes reveals some misguided assumptions about what autism looks like. The revelation \"doesn't change how I interact with them, but it may change how they interact with me,\" he observes over Skype from his home in Columbia, S.C. </p><p>   Yet Mr. Fleming, 26, will sometimes give an \"elevator speech\" about his idiosyncrasies to those he deals with regularly. He tells people that he finds most social interactions challenging and small talk especially draining; he rarely notices emotional reactions and is oblivious to non-verbal cues. He might add that he picks at his hair or sucks on his fingers when he is distracted. Some misunderstanding is inevitable, he says, because behaviors that tend to be instinctive for others, like using language and interpreting emotions, are often confusing and challenging for him. </p><p>   Mr. Fleming knows that he sees the world differently from other people. As he explains in his new book, \"How to Be Human: An Autistic Man's Guide to Life,\" which will be published by Simon &amp; Schuster on April 20, he often feels like he is on his own small island, visible from the neurotypical mainland but without a bridge. He wishes he could communicate telepathically, \"something where you could instantly mind sync with anybody, and just pop in and out.\" Instead, he's learned to adopt a set of rules for how to talk and act that most people intuit but he barely understands. He has discovered that if he hopes to communicate with anyone on the mainland, he needs to build the bridge himself. </p><p>   The book, which unfurls as an often-fascinating exchange between Mr. Fleming and Lyric Winik, his co-author and interlocutor, is not meant to be \"a happy-ending motivational story or a step-by-step manual for how people with autism can achieve success,\" writes Ms. Winik in an introduction. Despite Mr. Fleming's many accomplishments, which include a Rhodes Scholarship -- he received a degree from Oxford in 2019 -- he's not interested in being a poster child for autistic potential. Instead, he hopes to show what the neurotypical world looks like from the perspective of an outsider. </p><p>   As a young child, Mr. Fleming struggled with language and withdrew from other children. When he finally began uttering words in preschool, they rarely made sense to anyone but him. If someone touched his toys or failed to arrange the dining chairs a certain way, he would scream inconsolably for hours. Mr. Fleming says he remembers little from this time because he was, in his words, \"beneath the surface.\" He was diagnosed with autism when he was five years old. </p><p>   Lifting him out of himself and into the world became the job of his mother, Kelly Fleming, who abandoned her dreams of becoming a doctor in order to educate and care for him. \"Mom was an excellent teacher,\" Mr. Fleming says. She became the center of his world, and he \"would go crazy\" for years whenever she went anywhere without him. He dedicated his book to her: \"Now the world can see how much you have given me.\" </p><p>   Even with years of speech therapy, Mr. Fleming avoided most conversations until he was about 18. Unless he was exchanging factual information, he didn't see the point. He grew more interested in interacting with people when he began studying geography and marine sciences at the University of South Carolina, but speech still poses unique challenges. Because Mr. Fleming thinks in images, not language, whatever comes out of his mouth is the result of a laborious \"translation process\" that often feels awkward and imprecise, he says. The strain isn't obvious one-on-one, but larger groups and more complex environments deplete his energy at a rapid clip. </p><p>   Despite his evident facility with language, Mr. Fleming has a tough time with homonyms, sarcasm and common idioms, like \"bent out of shape.\" He also has trouble anticipating how people will receive what he says. He recalls that he once said one of his older brothers looked \"sexy\" in his sunglasses, and his family, with whom he is very close, broke out laughing. \"I guess that's a weird thing to say, but not to me,\" Mr. Fleming observes. There was also the time when he noticed that his younger sister had dyed her hair, but discovered he sounded critical because he failed to add a compliment. </p><p>   Baffling moments like these have left Mr. Fleming concerned that he will accidentally say something hurtful, so he takes great care with how he speaks. He still consults a manual he read in college that offers tips for dealing with people in emotional situations. (\"It was very specific, step-by-step. I loved it.\") Because a smile is rarely misinterpreted or misconstrued, he also tends to grin when he talks. \"I want to engage, I want to be a human and be part of life, and I'm choosing in a lot of cases how I do that,\" he says. \"My smile muscles get a lot of exercise.\" </p><p>   While he has cultivated an ability to think himself into another person's shoes, he recognizes that his emotional blind spots will always make relationships tricky for him. In recent years, however, Mr. Fleming has found comfort in a bond that feels both uncomplicated and loving: \"My relationship with my Creator is a relationship that I don't have to work at much at all.\" </p><p>   Mr. Fleming admits he is often flummoxed by practical tasks like grocery shopping, and he wishes he didn't need to be reminded to stop sucking his fingers. But he says he wouldn't trade his brain for a neurotypical one. He likes his strong memory -- he rarely needs to take notes -- and his visual way of thinking. Although he would prefer to be more emotionally intelligent, he's glad that he's not at the mercy of emotions, which he sees as \"unthinking\" and \"generally unhelpful.\" He is also grateful to not suffer \"hurt feelings.\" </p><p>   As a research associate studying climate adaptation at the University of South Carolina, Mr. Fleming is alarmed by the way emotions and politics have influenced efforts to address climate change. It is a problem that demands clear-eyed logic and \"a more autistic approach,\" he argues. </p><p>   Mr. Fleming says he is often asked why he tends to be \"generally undisturbed\" by the challenges of his life. Besides autism, he was diagnosed as a child with mild cerebral palsy and still wears braces on his legs for stability -- though he takes them off for Scottish country dancing, which he fell in love with at Oxford. He also has a metabolic condition that limits his ability to fully process nutrients from food, so he gets most of his nutrition through a feeding tube connected to a light backpack. He relies on a service dog named Daisy, who is trained to handle problems with his medical equipment and to be a source of comfort in otherwise agitating situations. His mother, who lives with him in Columbia, joined him for his years at Oxford because he still needs her care. </p><p>   His life, he acknowledges, has \"negative aspects in some ways.\" But, he says, these are well outweighed by what's positive. He feels grateful for life's pleasures -- Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the potatoes growing in his garden, a new set of espresso cups that make him \"feel fancy\" -- and buoyed by his Christian faith. Optimism, he argues, is \"more logical than pessimism, so you may as well just choose that.\" </p><p></p>",
