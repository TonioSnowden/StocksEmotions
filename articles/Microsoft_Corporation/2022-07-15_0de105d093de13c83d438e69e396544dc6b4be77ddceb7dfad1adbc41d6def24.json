  "title": "MANSION --- Private Properties: Paul Allen's Estate Sells Apartments In New York City",
  "text": "<p>If considered as one property, Mr. Allen's is among the most expensive ever sold in Manhattan, records show. While the record for a New York home was set in 2019 by the sale of an apartment at 220 Central Park South for $238 million to hedge-fund manager Ken Griffin, very few sales in the city have ever crossed the $100 million mark. The transaction is the most expensive co-op sale in the city's history, besting the previous record of $77.5 million set in 2015 by the sale of an apartment at 834 Fifth Avenue, according to appraiser Jonathan Miller.</p><p>The property wasn't publicly listed at the time of the sale, according to listings websites.</p><p>Records show Mr. Allen purchased the penthouse unit for $25 million in 2011. It wasn't clear how much he had paid for the other unit, which he bought earlier. A representative for a company that held some of Mr. Allen's real-estate assets didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The building, at 4 East 66th Street, is one of the most sought after residences in Manhattan's Lenox Hill, according to listings website StreetEasy. It was built by James E.R. Carpenter in 1920 and has only 16 apartments, according to the site.</p><p>The building has been home to prominent business people. Financier J. Christopher Flowers and his wife Anne W. Flowers recently bought a unit for $43 million, records show. In 2016, hedge-funder Daniel Nir and Jill E. Braufman sold their fifth-floor unit for $52 million.</p><p>Mr. Allen was anavid collector of real estate. When he died, he left behind a 4,000-acre Idaho retreat and hundreds of acres in the San Juan Islands among other properties. The property is the latest to be sold by Mr. Allen's estate following his death in 2018. Former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt recently paid $65 million fora piece of undeveloped land in Beverly Hills that had been owned by Mr. Allen.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
