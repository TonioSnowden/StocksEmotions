  "text": "<p>Many current market trends reflect stark reversals in sentiment from this time last year. Some of the moves can have a broad impact on businesses or reveal what investors anticipate for the economy.</p><p>Stocks</p><p>One of the central themes in the stock market's downturn this year is that investors have seemingly lost their appetite for risk. Value stocks are on pace to outperform growth stocks for the first time in years.</p><p>In the past few decades, value stocks, which tend to trade at a lower multiple of their book value or net worth, have typically underperformed growth stocks, their pricier counterparts. Growth stocks can be attractive to investors who expect that the companies will become bigger and more profitable.</p><p>Shares of less-proven growth companies were particularly favored during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the Fed lowered interest rates to near zero, pushing investors into riskier assets. Now the central bank is raising rates, and the tables have turned. Higher rates make the expected future earnings of higher-growth companies less attractive.</p><p>Many of the large tech-related companies that drove the rise of the S&amp;P 500 in the past decade dragged it into a bear market this year.</p><p>Peter Santilli</p><p>Bonds</p><p>The yield on 10-year Treasurys rose in the first half to its highest level since 2011. Rising inflation combined with expectations of more interest-rate increases have contributed to a selloff in the bond market. Bond yields rise as prices fall.</p><p>The Fed has taken an increasingly aggressive stance to combat inflation, even at the risk of raising the likelihood that the economy will fall into a recession. Uncertainty over the outlook for the economy and the Fed's policy has resulted in greater volatility in bond markets.</p><p>The yield on the shorter-term two-year Treasury note has risen to its highest level in more than a decade. It has converged this year with the 10-year and 30-year yields, an indicator that the market is anticipating a possible near-term U.S. recession. This red flag, when the gap between shorter- and longer-term yields closes, is known as the flattening of the yield curve.</p><p>Andrew Barnett</p><p>Commodities</p><p>Futures prices for U.S. natural gas earlier this year reached their highest level in more than a decade. The run-up was in part due to growing demand abroad. U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, hit record highs this spring as European countries focused on reducing their reliance on Russian gas.</p><p>Prices plunged in June after a fire knocked out an LNG shipping facility in Texas. The outage reduced U.S. export capabilities, meaning that a lot of shale gas that had been slated to be shipped abroad will now be available to traders to sock away in domestic storage facilities for winter, when demand is highest. The shipping facility isn't expected to begin operating again until late this year.</p><p>The interruption of exports from the Texas facility happened as European countries were racing to stock their underground gas reservoirs for the winter heating season. Russia has throttled its supply of natural gas to Europe in what officials claim is political retaliation for sanctions imposed on Russia's economy after its invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>The invasion has also affected wheat prices. The Russian blockade of Ukraine's ports has hindered the movement of goods out of the country, one of the top grain exporters in the world.</p><p>Wheat prices have fallen in recent weeks. Good weather in the U.S., Europe and Australia has improved the forecast for the end-of-summer harvest. Russia has managed to keep its wheat exports flowing and is expected to produce a record crop this year. Still, prices remain about 20% higher than they were at the start of the year.</p><p>Copper prices climbed through much of the pandemic and reached a record high in March, before receding in recent months. The metal is used in electronics, cars, home building and elsewhere. Copper's decline is another reflection of investors' dimming outlook for the global economy.</p><p>The price was also affected by China's announcement in June that it would be releasing metal reserves, including copper, to reduce the price for manufacturers. Even before the announcement, some analysts thought copper might have been overpriced given the supply and demand for the metal.</p><p>Andrew Mollica</p><p>Crypto</p><p>The broad selloff in cryptocurrencies started in November and has continued, as investors retreat from risky bets across markets.</p><p>Crypto's total value in circulation has fallen by about $2 trillion, or by more than two-thirds, since bitcoin hit an all-time-high late last year.</p><p>The price of bitcoin has dropped by about 70% from its peak of $67,802 last year. Ether, the second-most-popular cryptocurrency, has declined roughly 80%.</p><p>As digital currencies have eroded in value, crypto firms—which made a big splash in February with Super Bowl ads—have pulled back on marketing. They have also cut back on hiring. Coinbase Global Inc., the largest American crypto exchange, said it would slow its hiring pace, and another crypto exchange, Gemini Trust Co., cut 10% of its staff.</p><p>In another sign of declining confidence in crypto, stablecoins—digital currencies pegged to national currencies such as the U.S. dollar—have become unstable in the midst of the selloff. The price of TerraUSD, pegged to the dollar, fell to as low as 1 cent in early June. The crash has prompted regulators such as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to renew calls for regulation of stablecoin.</p><p>Ming Li</p><p>The dollar</p><p>The value of the dollar reached multidecade highs in the first half, driven by rising U.S. interest rates and weak overseas economic conditions. The WSJ Dollar Index measures the greenback against a basket of 16 currencies.</p><p>A strong dollar can help combat inflation because it makes imported goods less expensive, but it can also curtail economic growth. U.S. products become more expensive for foreigners, and American companies receive fewer dollars in exchange for their overseas exports.</p><p>Microsoft, for example, cut its sales and earnings guidance in June because of the impact of foreign-exchange rates and the stronger U.S. dollar. The significant share of the software company's profits that comes from overseas means that a more valuable dollar weighs on its business.</p><p>Investors will be watching for additional evidence of the dollar's impact on company revenue in the second half of the year. About 40% of S&amp;P 500 companies' revenue comes from outside of the U.S., according to FactSet estimates. That figure ranges from above 50% for the index's technology and materials sectors to less than 20% for its real-estate and utility sectors.</p><p>Nate Rattner</p><p>Wild First Half in Markets Sets Stage for More Big Moves in Rest of 2022</p>",
