  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  For those still inclined to think of Zoom Video Communications as a \"pandemic stock,\" consider that Covid-19 has well outlasted that status. </p><p>\n  Zoom shares hit their all-time high in mid-October of 2020, just weeks before news of the first vaccine breakthrough helped the world see an end to ceaseless video meetings and awkward happy hours. The stock has been in a mostly downward spiral since, even as the Delta and Omicron surges pushed back office reopenings. </p><p>\n  Zoom has shed more than three-quarters of its market value from its peak, and the stock's multiple has gone from 55 times forward sales to about eight times in that period. </p><p>\n  That would seem to create an easy setup for the company's fiscal fourth-quarter results due next Monday afternoon. Zoom also seems to have set itself a fairly low bar, projecting that revenue grew by 19% year over year to about $1.05 billion for the quarter ended Jan. 31. </p><p>\n  Sales would be more than five times what the company managed in the same quarter two years ago, before the pandemic's onset, though it also would be its slowest growth on record. </p><p>\n  But many analysts are still worried. Tyler Radke of Citigroup wrote Wednesday of \"rising competitive pressure,\" particularly from Microsoft, which competes squarely with Zoom through its Teams platform. Karl Keirstead of UBS echoed a similar view Thursday, noting that Microsoft Teams is \"winning more and more business on the Enterprise side.\" </p><p>\n  Growing competition from such a deep-pocketed rival will force Zoom to rev up spending in both sales and research and development. Zoom expended more than half its revenue on sales and marketing expenses before the pandemic. Explosive growth since then has skewed that ratio to an average of 27% over the past seven quarters. Zoom Chief Financial Officer Kelly Steckelberg also previously said the company intends to bring up its R&amp;D spending, which has lately averaged just 8% of revenue. </p><p>\n  The upshot is that Zoom's adjusted operating margin -- expected to come around 39% for the fiscal year ended January -- is likely going down. Ms. Steckelberg told a UBS investment conference in December that investors \"should expect continued contraction in our margins on a quarterly basis for at least next year and maybe even going forward.\" </p><p>\n  Investing in driving sales and future opportunities is to be expected for a company with a now well-known brand and still a lot of potential upside. Gartner estimates the current market for \"unified communications\" sits at nearly $45 billion a year -- more than 10 times Zoom's annual revenue. </p><p>\n  But investors have taken a dim view lately of cloud companies generally and particularly those entering investment mode at a time when sales are also slowing. That puts Zoom in a tough spot as some analysts believe Wall Street's expectations for 15% to 16% revenue growth in the current fiscal year are too high. Charles Rogers of M Science says the trends monitored during the fourth quarter suggest a range of 10% to 11% would be more realistic. </p><p>\n  That could reset expectations to a more beatable level but also would fall short of the \"squeaky clean prints\" Morgan Stanley's software analysts say are needed from cloud companies in the current market environment. </p><p>\n  Zoom might not be ready for its close-up. </p><p></p>",
