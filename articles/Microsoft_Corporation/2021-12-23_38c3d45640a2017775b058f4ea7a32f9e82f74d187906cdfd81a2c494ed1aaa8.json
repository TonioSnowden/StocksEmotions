  "text": "<p>Like other social-media sites, TikTok has its dark side. The video-sharing app's algorithms can drive minors to videos about sex, drugs and eating disorders, investigations by The Wall Street Journal have found.</p><p>TikTok didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.</p><p>Cloudflare said TikTok first started topping the charts as the world's most-visited site in February. But it grew in popularity in August, where it generally maintained the top spot for the rest of the year.</p><p>To come up with its rankings, Cloudflare said it uses data it has on global internet-traffic patterns.</p><p>TikTok was ranked seventh last year, but Cloudflare said 2020's list captured the last four months of the year because it started tracking web traffic in September 2020.</p><p>Google, which includes its search function, maps, language translation and other services, ranked second this year. It was followed by Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook, Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Netflix Inc., Alphabet's YouTube, Twitter Inc. and Meta's WhatsApp, according to Cloudflare.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
