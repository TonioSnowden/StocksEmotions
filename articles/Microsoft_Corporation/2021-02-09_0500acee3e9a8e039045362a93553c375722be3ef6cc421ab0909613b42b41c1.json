  "text": "<p>   Connecticut investigators are searching for clues in the fatal shooting of a Yale University graduate student, New Haven Police Department officials said Monday. </p><p>   Kevin Jiang, 26 years old, was shot to death in a car at about 8:30 p.m. on Saturday in New Haven's East Rock neighborhood, the police officials said. Mr. Jiang was a second-year student in the forestry program at the university's School of the Environment, according to university officials. </p><p>   Mr. Jiang's killing was the city's sixth homicide of the year, police officials said. </p><p>   New Haven Police Department Chief Otoniel Reyes said at a Monday news conference outside the department's headquarters that officers discovered Mr. Jiang with gunshot wounds after several 911 callers reported hearing gunfire and seeing a man injured. </p><p>   Mr. Jiang was operating a vehicle when he was shot multiple times, according to police officials. </p><p>   Chief Reyes said police are investigating whether Mr. Jiang was the intended target of the shooter and whether the killing may have been related to a conflict involving another motorist. </p><p>   Mr. Jiang's family couldn't be reached for comment. </p><p>   New Haven has seen a rise in crime in the past year, Chief Reyes said. Police officials recorded 122 shootings and 20 homicides in 2020, up from 77 shootings and 11 homicides in 2019. </p><p>   The dozen shootings recorded in the city so far this year outpaces the same period in 2020, Chief Reyes said. </p><p>   \"We're experiencing a spate of violence, but I have full confidence that we're going to turn this around,\" Chief Reyes said. </p><p>   New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker said at Monday's briefing that he believes the coronavirus pandemic is one of the driving factors behind the rise in crime because it has strained peoples' finances and left them stranded at home. </p><p>   \"We wouldn't be seeing the significant increase in violent crime around the nation had it not been for Covid,\" Mr. Elicker said. \"There's a lot of speculation as to why exactly that's happening.\" </p><p>   Yale University President Peter Salovey said at the briefing that school officials were working with authorities on the investigation, and that counseling would be made available to students and staff. </p><p>   Mr. Jiang was engaged to be married and had served in the U.S. Army National Guard, Mr. Salovey said. The victim's LinkedIn page said he served as a tank operator in the National Guard and was serving as an officer at the time of his death. Representatives for the National Guard didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   Mr. Salovey said Mr. Jiang had a keen sense of public service and had volunteered at a homeless shelter. </p><p>   Mr. Jiang's research at Yale had recently focused on the presence of mercury in fish from the Quinnipiac River, he said. </p><p>   \"The Yale community is grieving right now,\" Mr. Salovey said. \"This is the loss of an extraordinary young man. He was committed to applying his talents to improving the world.\" </p><p></p>",
