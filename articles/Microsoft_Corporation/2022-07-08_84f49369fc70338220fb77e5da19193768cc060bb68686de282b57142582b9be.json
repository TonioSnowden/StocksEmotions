  "title": "Kirk Quits HSBC  Following Backlash  Over Climate Talk  ----  By Margot Patrick",
  "text": "<p> HSBC Holdings PLC executive Stuart Kirk said he resigned, seven weeks after being suspended from his job for saying climate change need not be a worry for investors. </p> <p> Mr. Kirk, who was head of responsible investment and research at HSBC Asset Management, caused a firestorm with a conference presentation in May. He argued humans could adapt to climate emergencies and that policy makers were exaggerating the risks. It was taken as a broadside against the trillions of dollars flowing from investors into environmental, social and governance, or ESG, products and funds. </p> <p> Mr. Kirk's critics in the aftermath included HSBC Chief Executive Noel Quinn, who said the comments were inconsistent with the bank's aim to help the world cut carbon emissions to zero. </p> <p> In a post on LinkedIn Thursday, Mr. Kirk said he quit after concluding the bank's behavior toward him was unsustainable. </p> <p> \"Investing is hard. So is saving our planet. Opinions on both differ. But humanity's best chance of success is open and honest debate. If companies believe in diversity and speaking up, they need to walk the talk.\" </p> <p> He said he is starting a new project for investments based around overcoming challenges with human ingenuity. </p> <p> \"I will continue to prod with a sharp stick the nonsense, hypocrisy, sloppy logic and group-think inside the mainstream bubble of sustainable finance,\" Mr. Kirk wrote. </p> <p> An HSBC spokeswoman declined to comment. </p> <p> Mr. Kirk's May comments set off a debate across the finance industry. Banks, asset managers and other financial companies increasingly have touted their ESG credentials and made them a central plank in their own governance and strategies. For example, some of Mr. Quinn's pay awards are tied to ESG measures. </p> <p> Assets in funds focused on ESG principles hit $2.74 trillion last year, according to Morningstar. Pension funds and individual investors alike have said they want to back projects that curb environmental damage or social ills. Activist investors have pushed companies including Exxon Mobil to move faster to cut their climate risks. </p> <p> But critics say it is far from clear what difference the money has made in tackling the problems, and that many green investments would have happened anyway. </p> <p> ---</p> <p> Corrections &amp; Amplifications</p> <pre> </pre> <p> Margot Patrick wrote a Markets article on Friday about HSBC Holdings PLC executive Stuart Kirk's resignation. The byline incorrectly identified the writer as Hardika Singh.</p> <p> (WSJ July 11, 2022)</p>",
