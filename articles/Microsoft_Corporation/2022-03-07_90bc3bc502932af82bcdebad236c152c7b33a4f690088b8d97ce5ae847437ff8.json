Thank you.</em></p> <p>Hello from Frankfurt. Claire here; Alan's back next week. We're keeping a keen eye on oil prices, which have surged on the back of the news that Washington may reverse course and ban oil supplies coming from Russia. Global benchmark Brent was trading at just over $139 a barrel earlier on Monday, less than $10 shy of its <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=brent&amp;src=typed_query\">all-time high</a> of $147.50. </p> <p>The shift in position on Russia oil is leading to the US making friends in some unlikely places. Among them Caracas, with a high-level delegation <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/913af3e8-1a6a-46d2-a108-48e1ef74514f\">travelling</a> to the capital of oil-rich Venezuela over the weekend. The Biden administration is also <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-05/u-s-to-begin-review-of-tariffs-on-300-billion-of-china-imports\">launching</a> a review into $300bn-worth of tariffs on Chinese goods. Scrapping those tariffs would, of course, help ease the inflationary pain falling on US consumers. </p> <p>In the world of money, meanwhile, Visa has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08119b95-ee26-4f64-be43-49c57c75b030\">said</a> its Russian cards will soon no longer work for payments abroad — though they will still function within the country. And for everything else, there isn't Mastercard. They and American Express are looking at enforcing similar restrictions. </p> <p>In logistics news, shipping lines <a href=\"https://www.cma-cgm.com/news/4057/black-sea-and-ukraine-situation-update-3\">CMA CGM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0b51d7e-a33a-4018-98b9-4ce486080ccf\">MSC and Maersk</a> all halted bookings going to and from Russia last week. CMA CGM has also banned all bookings going to and from Belarus. </p> <p>Today's main piece revisits the shipping theme that made headlines last year, looking at whether this is one aspect of world trade witnessing a return to more normal conditions. </p> <h1>The sunk cost of waiting for shipping prices to sink</h1> <p>And now for some better news for the world's exporters. After a turbulent 2021, conditions in container shipping have calmed a little. Short-term rates have, following wave after wave of increases, finally stopped rising. </p> <p>But dip beneath the surface and it's clear that conditions for the world's exporters remain challenging. Take what's happening to longer-term contracts for shipping in one of the main arteries for world trade: East Asia to northern Europe. </p> <p>Since the pandemic the route has been hit by supply-chain disasters ranging from vessels getting stuck in the Suez Canal, to containers ending up in the wrong place (that is, Europe and the US, and not Asia — where the bulk of goods come from). At the same time, lockdowns led to soaring demand for consumer goods, the vast majority of which are imported into Europe and the US from Asia. The result: higher prices and delays. </p> <p>However, the burden has not been equally shared. The big shippers (the term the industry, rather confusingly, uses to describe exporters) have been shielded. While prices have risen across the board, much of the burden of the surge in short-term costs has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e087a2d7-0720-4a55-8aea-71d0ddf88635\">placed on smaller customers</a>. A greater portion of the big shippers' costs are set by long-term contracts too. </p> <p>With shippers keen to steer clear of volatility in spot rates, an even bigger chunk of business is set to be covered by longer-term deals. Maersk, one of the world's biggest lines, thinks about 70 per cent of trade by volume will come under long-term contract in 2022, up from 46 per cent in 2019. “Before the pandemic, the capacity was always there when needed,” said Peter Sand, chief analyst at Xeneta. “That's not what we've become accustomed to over the past couple of years.”</p> <p>This is good for the lines too. As Emile Naus, a partner at consultancy BearingPoint, put it to us: “The clear benefit for [the shipping industry] is an almost guaranteed revenue stream at good prices. This would remove the price volatility that has impacted the industry between 2008 and 2020.” </p> <p>Makes sense, right? However, it's not exactly full steam ahead. </p> <p>Long-term contracts are usually set before the turn of the year. But, three months into 2022, many deals are still yet to be signed. While the lines are offering rates lower than those charged in the spot markets, long-term prices remain well above where they were pre-pandemic. Shippers to Europe, betting on a fall, are refusing to sign year-long deals. Instead they are agreeing to contracts with a shorter duration, in some cases of just a few months. </p> <p>Which side will win out? It looks like the liners have the upper hand — longer-term rates have continued to rise. </p> <p>As Sand says: “It's still a carriers' market at the moment. And they set the bar high.” </p> <p>Analysts don't expect that to change anytime soon. </p> <p>Carriers put in orders for new vessels during the pandemic, but this extra capacity will not appear until 2023 at the earliest. “There will be no additional space on vessels this year, there's nothing significant coming online. That will keep prices high,” said Nathan Strang, director of ocean trade lane management at Flexport. “Penny pinching on logistics won't help if it means your goods won't end up on shelves.” </p> <p>The likeliest cause of a drop in prices would be a slump in demand for shippers' wares. Central banks on both sides of the Atlantic are intent on removing some of their monetary stimulus. Economies are reopening, raising the prospect that people spend more of their disposable income on experiences and less on buying goods. The war in Ukraine is expected to weigh on growth. Those trends should both damp export sales — and sentiment in the market for container shipping. </p> <p>But, so far this year, merchandise trade has remained buoyant. “Consumers are still consuming — retail sales figures are strong despite higher inflation weighing on purchasing power,” said Inga Fechner, of Dutch bank ING. “And the ratio between expenditures on goods and services is still above where it was pre-pandemic.” </p> <p>Then there's the impact of higher energy prices. “Fuel bills can easily reach as high as 50 per cent of carriers' spending. There's basically the ship and the fuel — there's not many sailors on board,” said Fechner's colleague, Rico Luman. “Fuel will stay more expensive due to energy transition. There will be carbon taxes in the EU, and later on perhaps the rest of the world, container liners are also calling for this.”</p> <p>We might not see surges on the scale we witnessed during 2021. But the scrap between European shippers and their carriers to secure the best long-term deals, coupled with the surge in commodity prices we've seen over the past few weeks, suggests conditions in the container shipping industry are set to remain stormy. </p> <h1>Trade links</h1> <p>China's <strong>Belt and Road Initiative</strong> is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidheniguk/status/1500767212705128450?s=21\">exposed to</a> Russia's invasion of Ukraine. </p> <p>Trade between <strong>China and Russia</strong> <a href=\"https://ph.news.yahoo.com/china-exports-16-3-trade-061753058.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLzRPSkRMODlHcHY&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMfRSHjLUFADU6J7xYGX_GpQblvVoLdmlV7Ed3KFPpDrwSJc5iXoQdCV6R0KziVcWgFfWsgKfNu01DQdNdJpbxW_hG-BY-3lD17HiziqUw5iqTXghZXlFtxL2qZeIcTqScJi75UlxqW5c82rGCIwvEcpWmEednlmgCetxoFkOqMF\">surged</a> between January and February, according to government figures. </p> <p>Several countries have, or are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88b1b680-cc23-4e69-ba2d-69c7d96910b0\">considering</a>, suspending <strong>“most favoured nation”</strong> status for Russia, a move that would raise the cost of trade. </p> <p>Dockers at the <strong>Stanlow oil refinery</strong> in Ellesmere Port in the north west of England have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-60631735\">refused</a> to unload a shipment of oil that came from Russia. </p> <p>Research from the Bundesbank <a href=\"https://www.bundesbank.de/en/publications/research/research-brief/2022-45-eu-immigration-labour-market-886406\">found</a> that <strong>migration from central and eastern Europe</strong> helped German workers too. </p><p>Source: Claire Jones 2022 'Russia sanctions spur surprising new relationships' FT.com 7 March.
