  "text": "<h2>‘What's Your ZIP code Story? Understanding and Overcoming Class Bias in the Workplace', by CJ Gross</h2> <p>Companies investing in diversity, equity and inclusion efforts already know that their employees' different identities — including race, gender, age and sexuality — affect their lived experiences. CJ Gross argues for the importance of including social class in these conversations, too.</p> <p>Gross, a diversity and inclusion consultant, brings a personal perspective — he was born to a single, working class mother, who raised him outside Washington, DC, in one of the wealthiest African American communities in the country, which made him aware of social divisions from a young age. </p> <p>“Class migrants”, or those from a working-class background who attempt upward mobility, can suffer in their careers because they aren't familiar with the invisible rules — and can feel alienated as a result. </p> <p>“Living in different zip codes does more than separate us by region: it becomes a barrier to establishing communication and building trusting relationships. If we are unable to relate to one another, the conversation usually comes to a screeching halt,” writes Gross.</p> <p>The book has chapters on what managers and class migrants need to know, tips for businesses on incorporating social class into their DEI initiatives, and a framework for how to use mentorship to build equity. Titbits on career growth, empathetic management, and more equitable work environments make this a valuable read for anyone who wants to support employees from all types of backgrounds.</p> <h2>‘25 Million Sparks: The Untold Story of Refugee&#xa0;Entrepreneurs', by Andrew Leon Hanna</h2> <p><em>25 Million Sparks</em> opens with a joyful wedding: a string of white lights drawn across the night sky, Syrian music, and a bride and groom surrounded by a crowd at the Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan.</p> <p>The bride has been dressed by Yasmina, who fled Syria while pregnant and now runs a wedding shop and salon at the camp. She is one of three Syrian women whose stories of entrepreneurship form the narrative of this book by Andrew Leon Hanna, an Egyptian-American lawyer, entrepreneur and author who won the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d98ba875-53f1-45e9-b645-6b8901ed129e\">FT's Bracken Bower prize in 2018</a>. There is also Malak, a young artist, and Asma, who runs a storytelling initiative for children.</p> <p>Hanna shines a light on how refugee entrepreneurs are uplifting the Za'atari community — and how they are thriving in other camps and cities around the world.</p> <p>Za'atari has existed since 2012 as a consequence of the Syrian civil war, but as the conflict has dragged on the camp has become the setting for thousands of start-ups and social initiatives. </p> <p>Hanna switches between the women's present lives in the camp and memories of the “darkness” each left behind in Syria. The narrative is interspersed with broader context of how the camp came into being in the first place, the causes of the broader refugee crisis, and thoughts on how to address it.</p> <p>While the writer acknowledges that he does not have the answers, the book is a form of activism through storytelling. Or, as he puts it, a “step to catalysing more concrete action”.</p> <p>Hanna seeks to counter what he sees as unfair perceptions of refugees, perpetuated by the media's emphasis on the economic burden of those who find themselves displaced, and the hopelessness of their situation — instead he inspires with examples of bravery, creativity and resilience. &#xa0;</p> <h2>‘Results: Getting Beyond Politics to Get Important Work Done', by Charlie Baker and Steve Kadish</h2> <p><em>Results</em> is an implementation guide for officers in the public service but it could be also used by leaders in any large organisation slowed by bureaucracy and politics.</p> <p>The book — written by Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts and Steve Kadish, his former chief of staff — is a step-by-step manual that leads to sustainable outcomes, examining how to move from identifying problems to actually achieving things.</p> <p>The authors begin exploring in detail the four pillars of what they call the “Results Framework”: people, facts, what to do and how to do it and measuring results. They emphasise the importance of selecting leaders and team members with knowhow, collaborative spirit and diverse backgrounds.</p> <p>In part two, they illustrate how the framework operates in practice through examples such as healthcare, transportation, child welfare and Covid-19.</p> <p>Chapters have a “tips, tools and tactics” section with useful suggestions, such as: “Go beyond the boundaries of an organisation in order to learn — breaking the information bubble that can form around a leader”. The point here is that organisations tend to turn inwards and it is important to build new knowledge by reaching out.</p> <p>The authors make clear that building trust with the public or clients is about commitment and pursuit. People do not expect leaders to get things right every time, but that they can learn from mistakes and appreciate what is possible.</p> <h2>‘A New Way to Think: Your Guide to Superior Management Effectiveness', by Roger Martin</h2> <p>Far too many of us keep repeating the same mistakes while expecting different results. Roger Martin, former dean and now professor emeritus of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, has been writing for several years about businesses that have overcome this challenge and has compiled a selection of his articles from the Harvard Business Review to create this guide.</p> <p>Each of the 14 self-contained chapters compares a dominant but flawed model with an alternative that Martin believes is superior. He caveats his analysis by saying that his answers are not necessarily the best possible ones, just better than the status quo.</p> <p>“One should always use the best model available, but watch closely to see whether it produces the outcomes that it promised,” he writes. “If it does, keep using it. If it doesn't, then you should work on creating a better model — one that produces results more in keeping with your goals.”</p> <p>Each chapter is a self-contained story, allowing readers to dip into the subjects of interest. This is a concise management handbook from someone who has spent a career analysing business strategies.</p> <h2>‘The Culture Playbook: 60 Highly Effective Actions to Help Your Group Succeed', by Daniel Coyle</h2> <p>Culture was a hot management and leadership topic even before the pandemic, and this book is a guide to building the workplace culture you want starting with what you already have. It gets to the point immediately: where does great culture come from? How do you get it, or turn round a culture that needs fixing?</p> <p>The author, who has advised organisations such as Microsoft and Google, is clear that culture “doesn't depend on who you are but on what you do”. It's a skill, he writes. And like any skill it can be done well or poorly. And culture isn't easy, even for those organisations that appear to already have a strong one, they “wrestle with plenty of problems”. Basically, it takes work.</p> <p>After setting out the rules — “start where you're at”; “create conversations not mandates”; “there are no rules” — the book is split into three sections. They focus on building psychological safety, sharing vulnerability and establishing a purpose.</p> <p>With a broad range of tips from holding pre-meeting warm-ups, to anxiety parties and marking the ends of projects, this book has lots of practical exercises for those serious about nurturing their company culture. This includes “zero tolerance of brilliant jerks”. </p> <p>Coyle reminds us that culture is “a work in progress”. And while these tips apply to everyone, “bias and unfairness can be baked into institutions and processes in insidious ways — so it is crucial to keep diversity, equality and inclusion at the fore when implementing any of these actions”.</p> <h2>‘The No Club: Putting a Stop to Women's Dead-End Work', by Linda Babcock, Brenda Peyser, Lise Vesterlund, Laurie R Weingart</h2> <p>Have you noticed that some workers are less likely to take on the boring jobs around the workplace that help make it function but do nothing for anyone's career, such as organising the office party, or steering committees? And maybe that these workers tend to be men?</p> <p>That is the thesis of a new book, <em>The No Club</em>, written by four female academics, spurred by their own experiences of being overwhelmed by mindless jobs that did little — or nothing — to advance their careers. They call these non-promotable tasks — or NPTs.</p> <p>The book is the result of their research. Their work examined the way that women and men structure their workload and the tasks they are expected to carry out. Based on this, it offers advice for women who want to fend off requests. </p> <p>Further, it also offers guidance to employers so they can consider the distribution of NPTs — could some of these voluntary tasks, for example, actually be made into promotable work? Sitting on a diversity committee, for instance, is valuable experience that can help develop a broad range of transferable skills.</p><p>Source: Sophia Smith, Amy Bell, Leo Cremonezi, Jonathan Moules, Janina Conboye and Emma Jacobs 2022 'FT business books: May edition' FT.com 11 May.
