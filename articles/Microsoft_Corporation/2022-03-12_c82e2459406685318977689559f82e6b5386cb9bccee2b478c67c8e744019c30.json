  "text": "<p>GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen wants to clean house at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond. The billionaire disclosed a 9.8% stake in the housewares retailer and is urging the company to explore a separation of the Buybuy Baby chain or a sale of the entire company while narrowing the focus of its turnaround plan and maintaining the right inventory mix to meet demand. Mr. Cohen's purchase is reminiscent of his move to amass a position in videogame retailer GameStop and lay the groundwork to take over the company's board. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond soared 34% Monday.</p><p>OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP.</p><p>OXY -1.4%</p><p>Carl Icahn slipped out of his big bet on Occidental Petroleum. The activist investor sold the last of what was once a roughly 10% stake in the oil-and-gas producer, and his two remaining board representatives are resigning. It ends one of Mr. Icahn's most dramatic recent clashes that began when he criticized Occidental for outbidding larger rival Chevron Corp. to strike a $38 billion deal to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. He also took issue with the $10 billion of financing from Warren Buffett that Occidental relied on to pay for the deal. Occidental shares fell 1.4% Monday.</p><p>SHELL PLC</p><p>SHEL +2.7%</p><p>European energy giants are pulling the plug on Russian oil. Shell and BP PLC said Tuesday they would withdraw in response to the invasion of Ukraine. Shell also apologized for snapping up a cargo of Russian crude at a bargain after other players curtailed their purchases. The two made the moves ahead of President Biden's ban of Russian oil and natural gas imports. American depositary shares of Shell rose 2.7% Tuesday.</p><p>MANDIANT INC.</p><p>MNDT -2%</p><p>Google is reaching for the cloud. The Alphabet Inc. unit said it reached a deal to acquire cybersecurity company Mandiant for nearly $5.4 billion, the second-largest Google's history. It is part of an effort by the technology giant to bolster its cloud unit, which is smaller than key rivals. The deal puts Google into more direct competition with Microsoft Corp., and comes as the company faces antitrust lawsuits from the Justice Department and multiple states for allegedly anticompetitive practices. Mandiant shares fell 2% Tuesday after gaining 16% Monday.</p><p>UBER TECHNOLOGIES INC.</p><p>UBER +7.6%</p><p>Uber wants to hit the brakes on unionization efforts. Uber, Lyft Inc. and other companies that use independent contractors as drivers are launching a campaign to head off Democratic efforts to classify their workers as employees, which would let many of them unionize. The companies plan to run TV and internet ads featuring workers who say they prefer the flexibility of the independent-contractor model. Labor unions say Uber and other gig-economy companies exploit workers by not giving them enough hours to qualify for healthcare and other benefits. Uber shares rose 7.6% Tuesday.</p><p>CAMPBELL SOUP CO.</p><p>CPB +0.8%</p><p>Sales cooled for Campbell. The company behind namesake soups and snacks like Goldfish crackers and SpaghettiOs on Wednesday posted lower quarterly sales as labor and supply constraints weighed on operations and profitability. Even though Campbell faces surging costs, the food company said it is seeing the labor market improve and expects its price increases to better mitigate inflation. The company reiterated its fiscal 2022 guidance, with Chief Executive Mark Clouse saying that demand remains strong. Campbell shares added 0.8% Wednesday.</p><p>PELOTON INTERACTIVE INC.</p><p>PTON -3.5%</p><p>Peloton will take a new pricing strategy for a spin. The company said on Thursday it will start a new pricing system in which customers pay a single monthly fee that covers both the namesake stationary bike and a monthly subscription to workout courses, part of a bid to turn around the company. Starting Friday, select Peloton stores will for a limited period offer a bike and subscription for between $60 and $100 a month, and if a customer cancels the company would take back the bike with no charge. Peloton shares lost 3.5% Thursday.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
