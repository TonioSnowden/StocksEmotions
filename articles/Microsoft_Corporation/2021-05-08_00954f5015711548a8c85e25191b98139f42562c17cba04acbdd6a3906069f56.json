  "text": "<p>Two of the world's richest people are ending their marriage after 27 years. The announcement from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda Gates, who is co-chair of their philanthropic foundation, came on their Twitter accounts Monday. They filed a divorce petition in Washington state on Monday that indicated they have a separation agreement under which they plan to divide their assets. Bill Gates also transferred holdings worth nearly $2.4 billion. His personal stake in Microsoft is worth around $26 billion, according to FactSet. Microsoft shares fell 1.6% Tuesday.</p><p>CVS HEALTH CORP.</p><p>CVS +4.4%</p><p>CVS's vaccination efforts could use a shot in the arm. Demand, it says, has slowed as Americans' hesitancy to receive the shots outweighs expanding eligibility and access. The pharmacy chain said Tuesday that vaccine demand has fallen by about 30% recently. CVS started offering walk-in and same-day appointments for injections in a bid to improve uptake. Chief Executive Karen Lynch said education on the vaccine's safety and efficacy is needed to address parts of the population that are afraid to get the shot. CVS has administered more than 17 million shots. CVS shares gained 4.4% Tuesday.</p><p>PELOTON INTERACTIVE INC.</p><p>PTON -15%</p><p>Peloton is recalling its Tread+ treadmills after dozens of injuries and at least one death. The home-fitness company said Wednesday it was also halting sales of the model. Chief Executive John Foley apologized for the company's initial refusal to comply with regulators who pushed for the action weeks ago. The Consumer Product Safety Commission told people with young children or pets in mid-April to stop using the Tread+ and urged a recall of the product. Mr. Foley initially called the CPSC advisory inaccurate and misleading. Peloton shares lost 15% Wednesday.</p><p>UBER TECHNOLOGIES INC.</p><p>UBER -8.9%</p><p>Hunger for food delivery is helping Uber make up for a slump in ride-sharing demand. Uber reported Wednesday that its first-quarter bookings rose thanks to sustained growth at Uber Eats, which now accounts for nearly two-thirds of total bookings. Uber executives said they expect the ride-hailing business to bounce back as vaccinations pick up in the coming months. But the company acknowledged that it faces a shortage of drivers as some are still hesitant to ferry passengers over food. Uber is offering incentives for drivers to return. Uber shares fell 8.9% Thursday.</p><p>WINGSTOP INC.</p><p>WING -1.5%</p><p>A chicken shortage is causing costs to soar for some restaurants. After a year promoting takeout wings and crispy chicken sandwiches, restaurants including Yum Brands Inc.-owned KFC and Wingstop Inc. say they are paying steep prices for scarce poultry. Some are running out of or limiting sales of tenders, filets and wings, cutting into some of their most reliable sales, while owners of independent eateries say they've gone weeks without wings. Chicken suppliers are struggling to produce more because of trouble getting enough workers. Wingstop shares lost 1.5% Thursday.</p><p>CINEMARK HOLDINGS INC.</p><p>CNK +5.3%</p><p>A cinema giant is striking back. Cinemark said it reached new deals with some major Hollywood studios in a move designed to establish how long movies play in theaters before moving to home video. The deals announced Friday are with Warner Bros. Picture Group, Walt Disney Co., Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment, building on a November pact with Universal Filmed Entertainment Group. In the U.S., 98% of Cinemark's theaters have reopened, Chief Executive Mark Zoradi said. Cinemark shares gained 5.3% Friday.</p><p>MODERNA INC.</p><p>MRNA +4%</p><p>Moderna wants to inject its Covid-19 vaccine deeper into sicker parts of the developing world. The drugmaker said it will supply 34 million doses to the World Health Organization-backed Covax initiative, an international program that distributes free shots to poorer countries. The announcement comes as coronavirus infections surge in countries such as India and Brazil. Moderna shares rose 4% Monday.</p>",
