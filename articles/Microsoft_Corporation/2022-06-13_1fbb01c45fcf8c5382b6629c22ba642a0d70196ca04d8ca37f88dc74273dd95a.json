  "text": "<p>Hundreds, if not thousands, of U.S. companies already disclose some kind of climate-related information, often lacking comparability, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said at an event Thursday. \"There's some fragmented approach to this,\" he said.</p><p>Chief financial officers expect that complying with the proposed rule would be costly. \"We understood that when the SEC started talking about [the rule], that this was going to be a lot of work and you're not going to do it with arms and legs,\" said Sameer Ralhan, the CFO of chemical producer Chemours Co., referring to the need for technology to tackle potential new disclosure requirements.</p><p>Chemours last year began adding resources to its finance team, including personnel and technology, to make certain climate-related disclosures by the third quarter of next year, Mr. Ralhan said.</p><p>The company recruited people with analytical capabilities, including a controller for environmental, social and governance issues, Mr. Ralhan said. Currently, Chemours is looking for an assistant controller for ESG accounting who will help with ensuring the company meets stakeholders' and regulators' expectations on climate change and other reporting, according to a LinkedIn post. The company said the role hasn't been filled yet. Mr. Ralhan declined to disclose the number of roles added to the finance team.</p><p>Some companies said they welcome the SEC's rule-making effort, as it could result in publicly available information that can be compared across companies. How that benefit will stack up against the costs, however, depends on what the final rule requires, said Baris Oran, CFO of GXO Logistics Inc., a supply-chain and warehousing-logistics company. Even though there isn't a final rule yet, GXO is \"actively hiring\" for sustainability roles. This includes three hires in the past year and efforts to add a director to the ESG team, according to Mr. Oran.</p><p>The SEC estimates the cost of compliance with its proposed rule during the first year would be around $640,000 for large companies, with continuing annual costs predicted to drop to $530,000.</p><p>The cost for companies could easily be higher than the SEC's estimates, said Amy Lynch, president of regulatory and compliance consulting firm FrontLine Compliance LLC and a former accountant at the SEC. Regulators' cost predictions tend to underestimate the spend on coming up to speed with new obligations, Ms. Lynch said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
