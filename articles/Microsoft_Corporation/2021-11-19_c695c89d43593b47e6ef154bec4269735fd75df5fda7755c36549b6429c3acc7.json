  "text": "<p>I agree with Brooke Masters (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b570148b-15b4-4789-994e-b46810a205e4\">Opinion</a>, November 11) that “GE may be breaking up but conglomerates will survive”. The modern conglomerate was born of the long wave of electrical technological development led by entrepreneurs like Thomas Edison and Werner von Siemens. This industrial conglomerate is predicated on economies of physical scale — physical products in a world where economic resources are scarce, assets are tangible and the law of diminishing returns holds sway.</p> <p>Tech giants like Microsoft, Google and Facebook were born of the digital ICT wave, as software companies in a non-physical world where digital resources are abundant, not scarce. Production of extra copies of a digital product, like Google search, cost effectively nothing and can be distributed 24/7 from a digital master with the click of a button. </p> <p>Digital components, including acquired digital products — eg WhatsApp incorporated into the Facebook infrastructure — are relatively easily integrated. Specifically digital platforms, like Amazon, are designed to integrate a wide range of digital components allowing them to address previously unconnectable markets. </p> <p>This leads to powerful economies of digital scope never imagined before. The purely digital conglomerate is thus based on economies of both digital scale and digital scope for digital products that are abundant, assets that are intangible and where the law of increasing returns dominates. </p> <p>Yes, the conglomerate will survive but an increasing number will be digital conglomerates, or at least tech giants like Amazon and Apple based on a digital infrastructure.</p> <p><strong>Neil S McPhater</strong> <br><em>Longstanton, Cambridgeshire, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Tech will dominate the conglomerates that survive' FT.com 19 November.
