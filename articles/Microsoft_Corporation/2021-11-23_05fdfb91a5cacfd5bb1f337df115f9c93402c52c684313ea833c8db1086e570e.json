  "title": "Zoom Sales Growth Loses Momentum --- Videoconferencing demand eases as more people return to the workplace",
  "text": "<p>Zoom's net income for its fiscal third quarter rose more than 70% from a year earlier to $340 million. Analysts projected sales of $1.02 billion and net income of $337 million.</p><p>For its current quarter ending in January, Zoom expects total sales between $1.051 billion and $1.053 billion, better than the $1.018 billion expected by Wall Street, according to FactSet.</p><p>Shares in Zoom were down 5.9% at $228 in after-hours trading.</p><p>Zoom has been unable to maintain the heady growth it experienced when organizations leaned heavily into remote work after the onset of Covid-19. Amid the pandemic, Zoom's sales shot up fourfold from the previous year.</p><p>The company also faces increased competition. Microsoft Corp.'s Teams application, which combines videoconferencing and other collaboration features, poses one of the biggest challenges to Zoom's market share.</p><p>Microsoft said in July that Teams had reached record levels, with nearly 250 million monthly active users. Microsoft also intends to bring Teams to every Windows user as part of its next-generation operating system now being rolled out.</p><p>Microsoft and Meta Platforms Inc., formerly called Facebook, are planning the next steps of what remote-collaboration workspaces could look like through virtual worlds known as the metaverse.</p><p>Some investors are concerned that Zoom's best days are behind it unless it finds new businesses. The value of Zoom's shares are down more than 40% from a year ago.</p><p>Other companies such as Peloton Interactive Inc. that experienced sizable gains during the pandemic's initial stay-at-home phase have also struggled to maintain growth as businesses and schools reopen.</p><p>Some of Zoom's diversification plans have been thwarted. In September, the company's nearly $15 billion offer to acquire the cloud call-center business Five9 Inc. was abandoned over differences in price.</p><p>The deal also faced a Justice Department-led investigation over potential national-security risks presented by Zoom's ties to China.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
