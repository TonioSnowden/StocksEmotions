  "title": "From Russia With Intimidation  ----  By Paul Podolsky",
  "text": "<p>   I'm American, and my wife is from Russia. We met when I was working as a reporter there in the early 1990s. My wife loathes Vladimir Putin and the security services he served. As a student in Moscow, she was expelled from university at the KGB's behest for watching a film at the American Embassy. I've written on these pages before about my Moscow-based, Putin-supporting mother-in-law, Maria. </p><p>   When the Ukraine war started, my wife took to rebutting the Facebook posts of Mr. Putin's chief propagandist, Maria Zakharova. Facebook is banned in Russia, but Ms. Zakharova used it to make Moscow's case to the world. My wife, from the safety of our Connecticut home, dared to note that Bucha and other possible war crimes did indeed occur. I too wrote articles that could be deemed critical of Mr. Putin's invasion. </p><p>   At the same time, we continued to talk to the other Maria, my wife's mother, via Skype even though that too is banned. Maria has an eighth-grade education and is a former hospital janitor -- hardly a target I thought the security services would monitor. My wife and I joked about the FSB listening in to our calls. We aren't laughing anymore. </p><p>   My wife recently underwent significant surgery. After the fact, she mentioned this with her mother on a Skype call. Shortly thereafter, Maria received a phone call on her Moscow landline from a man who didn't identify himself. </p><p>   \"We know your daughter has a medical condition,\" he said. \"This is retribution for her traitorous behavior toward Russia.\" Then he hung up. </p><p>   I can't say for sure, but who else beyond the FSB would conduct such an operation? Maria was too scared to call us. Instead she phoned an intermediary, who relayed the details and said Maria was putting a halt to our conversations and didn't support traitors. She instinctively sided with the secret police against her daughter. </p><p>   \"I can't understand her,\" I said to a Russian friend. </p><p>   \"This is normal for Russians,\" he replied. </p><p>   On reflection, I realized he was right. It is like Pavlik Morozov, a touchstone of Soviet propaganda. In 1932, 13-year old Pavlik turned his black-marketing father in to the secret police. The father was promptly shot and Pavlik lauded as a hero. Relatives in turn killed Pavlik and were then also shot by the secret police. </p><p>   A police state brings out the worst in people, and Maria has lived under that influence all her life. She grew up under Stalin. She has an instinctive fear of the state's power. Certain thoughts aren't to be thought. </p><p>   What's now the FSB has been, with some modifications, the KGB, NKVD, Cheka and Okhrana -- a lineage that stretches back to czarist times. The FSB's purpose today is the same as the KGB's during the Soviet era, even if the tools -- social media -- have evolved. They want to silence debate, to get my wife and others to stop speaking out. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Podolsky is author of \"Master, Minion.\" He writes the Things I Didn't Learn in School newsletter on Substack.com. </p><p></p>",
