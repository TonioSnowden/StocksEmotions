  "text": "<p>1. 2022 Tesla Model S Plaid</p><p>Top speed: 200 mph</p><p>0-60 time: 1.99 seconds</p><p>Starting price: $135,990</p><p>The steering yoke is polarizing but there's no denying that the Model S Plaid is fast â€” very fast. Tesla TSLA says it has a top speed of 200 miles per hour and can go from zero to 60 in 1.99 seconds. The vehicle uses its three motors to produce 1,020 horsepower. It's an impressive piece of engineering from the automaker that made EVs mainstream. Now we just have to wait to see what the upcoming Tesla Roadster can accomplish. </p><p>2. 2022 Lucid Air Dream Performance</p><p>Top speed: 169 mph</p><p>0-60 time: 2.5 seconds</p><p>Starting price: $169,000</p><p>Populated by former Tesla employees, Lucid's LCID first vehicle, the Air, takes aim at Tesla's speed dominance. With a top speed of 169 mph, the Dream variant has 1,111 horsepower. It'll go from zero to 60 in 2.5 seconds and it does all this with a luxury interior and more importantly, an estimated EPA range of 471 miles. That makes it the range king, stealing the crown from Tesla. It also looks outstanding.</p><p>Also see: Smart IRA or 401(k) moves you can make as Wall Street tanks</p><p>3.

It's still pricey at $138,990, but it can haul you and your family from zero to 60 in 2.5 seconds. The top speed of 163 mph is best used on a track. Right now, though, it's the fastest EV SUV available. </p><p>4.
