  "title": "Second  Theranos  Leader  Convicted  Of Fraud  ----  By Heather Somerville and Meghan Bobrowsky",
  "text": "<p>   SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A federal jury convicted Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, the former top lieutenant to Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes, on all 12 charges that he helped perpetuate a yearslong fraud scheme at the blood-testing startup. </p><p>   The verdict is the second conviction against Theranos leadership and comes six months after a jury found Ms. Holmes guilty of fraud; it secures another major victory for the U.S. government, which brought the case against the pair in 2018. </p><p>   It brings to conclusion one of Silicon Valley's most notorious startup implosions, which saw nearly $1 billion of investor money evaporate after revelations that the company delivered inaccurate blood-test results to patients, including for life-threatening conditions, and that Ms. Holmes and Mr. Balwani lied about its proprietary technology. </p><p>   Mr. Balwani, Theranos's former president and chief operating officer, was charged with 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. His case, like Ms. Holmes's, marked a rare prosecution of a technology executive, and served as a referendum on startups taking the culture of \"fake it until you make it\" too far. Mr. Balwani faces up to 20 years in prison for each count for which he was found guilty, but former prosecutors said such a stiff sentence is rare in white-collar cases. </p><p>   Mr. Balwani's lawyers argued he wasn't in charge at Theranos and that the responsibility for the company rested with Ms. Holmes. He used investor money as promised, to build the company, they said, and invested his own money to help the startup succeed. Mr. Balwani's verdict shows how the government, in its second time prosecuting the case against the Theranos executives, appeared to have buttoned up its arguments following Ms. Holmes's trial, which had a more mixed result. </p><p>   Most notably, the jury in Mr. Balwani's case found him guilty on all counts related to defrauding patients -- counts for which Ms. Holmes wasn't convicted, an outcome that disappointed patients affected by Theranos's faulty technology. A jury of seven women and five men deliberated for about 32 hours before reaching the verdict. </p><p>   Mr. Balwani, 57 years old, said nothing as he left the courthouse. </p><p>   In an email, Jeffrey Coopersmith, Mr. Balwani's lawyer, wrote: \"We are obviously disappointed with the verdicts. We plan to study and consider all of Mr. Balwani's options including an appeal.\" </p><p>   Ms. Holmes, 38, was found guilty on four of the 11 fraud charges against her and acquitted of four, and the jury couldn't reach a unanimous conclusion on three. Mr. Balwani didn't testify in his own defense, as Ms. Holmes did. She is free while she awaits sentencing in September. </p><p>   Mr. Balwani's sentencing was set for November. He also is free on a $750,000 bond. </p><p>   Stephanie Hinds, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California, said the verdict shows Mr. Balwani shares responsibility with Ms. Holmes for perpetrating fraud \"on unsuspecting patients.\" </p><p>   Mr. Balwani's trial lacked the spectacle of Ms. Holmes's, when members of the media and public gathered hours before dawn outside the courthouse for one of the coveted seats, and Ms. Holmes filled courtroom benches with friends and family. Yet lawyers who followed the case said Mr. Balwani's trial was no less important -- he was one half of a power couple and accused of carrying out the same crimes. </p><p>   Mr. Balwani was in charge of the company's lab, where the blood testing occurred, and was quick to rebuff and sometimes fire employees who raised concerns about the performance of Theranos technology, prosecutors and witnesses said. He was responsible for the financial models given to investors that greatly exaggerated revenue, prosecutors said, and he managed the company's partnership with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., in which the startup would offer its finger-prick tests inside the drugstore chain. </p><p>   Mr. Balwani joined Theranos in 2009 as vice chairman of its board and the following year became president and chief operating officer, a position he held until 2016. He and Ms. Holmes were in a romantic relationship for more than a decade. Mr. Balwani helped finance the startup by underwriting a $12 million loan in April 2010, and bought $4.6 million in stock. His lawyers pointed to his financial investment as proof that he acted in good faith because he had millions of dollars on the line at Theranos. </p><p>   Mr. Balwani's and Ms. Holmes's convictions are the culmination of a scandal that surfaced through a series of articles by The Wall Street Journal in 2015 and 2016 calling into question Theranos's claims about its proprietary blood-testing technology. </p><p>   Mr. Balwani met Ms. Holmes in 2002 during a language-immersion trip to China when she was 18 and he was 37, prosecutors said. They reconnected while she was a student at Stanford University, where Ms. Holmes had dreamed up the idea for what would become Theranos: revolutionizing blood-testing by eliminating the need for large needles and vials of blood. Mr. Balwani encouraged her to drop out and build a startup. They developed a romantic relationship and moved in together. A few years later, she asked him to join the company. They kept their personal relationship mostly secret from employees, investors and board members. </p><p>   Mr. Balwani is a veteran tech executive who worked in software, including at Lotus Software and Microsoft Corp., but much of his wealth derived from work at an e-commerce startup CommerceBid.com, which was acquired in 1999 for about $228 million in cash and stock. Mr. Balwani received shares as part of the deal that he sold for more than $40 million, wealth he used to help prop up Theranos for a time. </p><p>   Through documents and witness testimony, prosecutors showed that Mr. Balwani had near free rein at Theranos and was fully informed about its many technical problems, laboratory challenges and cash shortfalls. </p><p>   \"He sought to know everything he could about everything,\" Mark Pandori, Theranos's lab director from 2013 to 2014, who reported to Mr. Balwani, said in his testimony in March. He \"sought to have as much intelligence about what was going on in the company as he could at all times.\" </p><p>   Crucially, he was responsible for the lab when in 2015 a federal regulatory inspection uncovered serious deficiencies that would eventually lead to Theranos closing its blood-testing facilities. </p><p>   Prosecutors showed a text message Mr. Balwani sent Ms. Holmes in July 2015: \"I am responsible for everything at Theranos. All have been my decisions too.\" </p><p>   At its peak, Theranos was valued at more than $9 billion, 10th-largest at the time among venture-capital-backed startups. Mr. Balwani's stake was worth $500 million for a time, and Ms. Holmes's was worth $4.5 billion. They never sold their shares. </p><p>   Their on-paper wealth was propelled by claims that their technology could cheaply and quickly run more than 200 health tests using a proprietary device that required just a finger prick of blood. </p><p>   The trials have shown a different reality. The company managed to use its proprietary finger-prick blood-testing device for just 12 types of patient tests. Those results were unreliable. At its lab, Theranos secretly ran another 27 blood tests on commercial devices from other companies that it altered to work with tiny blood samples. Patients testified about receiving false test results. One result wrongly indicated that a woman could be HIV positive; another incorrectly led a pregnant woman to believe she was miscarrying. </p><p></p>",
