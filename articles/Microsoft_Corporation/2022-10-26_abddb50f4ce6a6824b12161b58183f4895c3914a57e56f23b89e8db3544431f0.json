  "title": "John Fetterman's Health in Spotlight After Uneven Debate Against Mehmet Oz; Some Democrats worry his performance could hurt their chances in crucial Pennsylvania Senate race",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Fetterman suffered a stroke in May that he has said didn't affect his cognitive skills but left him with challenges in processing language and, at times, articulating words.</p><p>\"I wanted to cry. It was very difficult to watch,'' said Larry Ceisler, a Democrat and statewide public-affairs consultant in Philadelphia, who supports Mr. Fetterman.</p><p>David Axelrod, a top Democratic strategist who led both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, said on Twitter that Mr. Fetterman failed on his primary debate goal.</p><p>\"Fetterman needed to show he's sufficiently recovered, and this debate surely did not help,\" he wrote. He added: \"Oz needed to show authenticity, decency and connection. I'm sure his team is high-fiving tonight but he didn't help himself on those essential scores.\"</p><p>Democrats have long considered winning the Pennsylvania seat, now held by the GOP, as key to their hopes of preserving their control of the Senate. A win there would offset a potential loss by a Democratic incumbent such as Nevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto in a chamber currently now 50-50. There are also competitive races for Republican-held seats in North Carolina and Wisconsin, but polls show those to be steeper climbs for Democrats.</p><p>Joseph DiSarro, who until recently was a member of the Pennsylvania Republican Party state committee, said that for the Fetterman campaign, \"It was a huge, catastrophic mistake to debate.\" He added that undecided voters are likely to find Mr. Fetterman's performance was lacking.</p><p>But Mr. DiSarro, a political-science professor at Washington &amp; Jefferson College in southwestern Pennsylvania, also said that voters on reflection might give little weight to the debate when choosing a candidate.</p><p>MAGA Inc., a super PAC associated with former President Donald Trump, started airing a new television ad Wednesday in the Pennsylvania race that highlights Mr. Fetterman's speech issues as it suggests that the Democrat \"just isn't right.\"</p><p>The ad uses a campaign trail comment made by Mr. Fetterman in September where he appeared to misspeak when trying to compare two different National Football League teams. \"The Eagles are so much better than the Eagles!\" the candidate told a Philadelphia crowd. (Asked at the end of Tuesday's debate which of the state's two NFL teams they preferred, Mr. Fetterman picked the Pittsburgh Steelers while Mr. Oz chose the Philadelphia Eagles.)</p><p>Mr. Ceisler, for his part, was particularly distressed by what he described as Mr. Fetterman's \"rough'' opening and closing statements—parts of the debate that traditionally are well-practiced and don't involve give-and-take with an opponent. \"If I would have been back in my old days coaching debate prep, it would have been all about the open and the close,\" Mr. Ceisler said.</p><p>Still, like many Democrats, Mr. Ceisler said it was unclear to him whether the debate would prove meaningful to voters. Some Democrats noted that more than 550,000 people have already cast early ballots, or about 11% of the number who voted in 2018, and argued that few voters are up for grabs at this point.</p><p>\"Which voters matter at this stage in terms of who is persuadable? It's the people who are most unplugged from politics,\" said Mike Mikus, a Democratic strategist outside Pittsburgh. \"These voters are going to be the least impacted by what's coming out of this debate. And they're not thinking about Fetterman's health. They're thinking about the issues important to them.\"</p><p>Some supporters said Mr. Fetterman should have taken a pass on the debate, especially considering that the state's other marquee contest—the governor's race—isn't expected to have a debate before the election.</p><p>Ted Strickland, a former Democratic governor of neighboring Ohio, said he watched the debate live with his wife. He said his initial reaction was that he wasn't sure Mr. Fetterman \"should have done this,\" but after watching the full event and discussing it with his spouse, he landed on another opinion.</p><p>\"He showed courage and a willingness to put himself out there and I think that should mean something to people,\" Mr. Strickland said Wednesday.</p><p>Emilia Rowland, a Fetterman campaign spokeswoman, made a similar case. \"Political Twitter is one thing,'' she said, \"but real people who watched the debate last night—their takeaway is here's a guy who was in the hospital months ago and is now on the debate stage talking about the issues, and his positions and his values are crystal clear.\"</p><p>Allies of Mr. Oz had argued recently that strong communication skills are essential for a senator to be effective, and that Mr. Fetterman had a responsibility to show his capabilities. In a public appearance on Wednesday, Mr. Oz didn't comment on his opponent's debate performance.</p><p>Instead, Mr. Oz continued his attacks on Mr. Fetterman as unsupportive of law enforcement and too eager to press the state Board of Pardons, which he leads in his role as lieutenant governor, to release violent criminals. The criticism has been a main element of TV ads attacking Mr. Fetterman in recent weeks and comes after homicides hit a record high last year in Philadelphia, the state's largest city.</p><p>\"Dozens of times, he's voted to release these inmates,\" Mr. Oz said at the Harrisburg offices of the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association. \"Several dozen times he was voting against the other parole board members, and in almost all cases going against the desires of the family\" of the victims.</p><p>Mr. Fetterman has said he proved his commitment to law enforcement and public safety by working with police in Braddock, the small borough he served as mayor, on programs that halted gun violence there for several years.</p><p>Democrats argued that Mr. Oz hurt himself among women and swing voters by saying in the debate that \"local political leaders\" should decide on abortion regulations. His argument was that while he opposes legalized abortion with narrow exceptions, his views as a senator wouldn't affect state law.</p><p>\"I want women, doctors, local political leaders, letting the democracy that's always allowed our nation to thrive to put the best ideas forward so states can decide for themselves,\" Mr. Oz said.</p><p>The Fetterman campaign immediately produced an ad highlighting the comment and said it would spend significantly to promote the spot, especially among suburban women. \"This is who Dr. Oz wants in charge of women's healthcare decisions,\" the ad says.</p><p>The Democrat's campaign said Wednesday afternoon that it had raised more than $2 million since the debate and would use some of the money to pay for the ad.</p><p>Write to Aaron Zitner at aaron.zitner@wsj.com and John McCormick at mccormick.john@wsj.com</p><p>John Fetterman's Health in Spotlight After Uneven Debate Against Mehmet Oz</p>",
