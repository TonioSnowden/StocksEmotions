  "text": "<p>   AUSTIN, Texas -- Lawmakers in Texas were set to vote on Republican-sponsored election legislation Thursday night after Florida's governor signed that state's election bill into law. </p><p>   Republicans say the laws include new measures that will increase election security, while Democrats contend they will restrict voting access, particularly for minority communities. </p><p>   The Texas bill has received pushback from civil-rights groups and corporations. The White House criticized the Florida law after Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed it, and several groups jointly sued in federal court, arguing the law would impede voters' access to the ballot box. </p><p>   The Texas bill and Florida law follow a Georgia law, passed in March, that included new identification requirements for mail-in voters and set limits on ballot drop boxes. </p><p>   The Texas House was expected to vote on a bill that would increase criminal penalties for some voting irregularities. If passed, it could be harmonized alongside a bill already passed by the state Senate that limits early voting hours, prohibits drive-through voting and allows partisan poll watchers to photograph people voting. </p><p>   Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, made the election bills a priority of the biennial session. In March, he said: \"In the 2020 election, we witnessed actions throughout our state that could risk the integrity of our elections and enable voter fraud, which is why I made election integrity an emergency item.\" </p><p>   Opponents say the bill could make it harder for people to exercise their voting rights. \"Criminalizing things that could be a simple mistake could be a deterrent to finding poll workers,\" said Rep. Jessica Gonzalez, a Dallas-area Democrat who is the House election committee vice chair. \"I think it's a terrible piece of legislation.\" </p><p>   On Tuesday, about 50 companies and business associations issued a joint statement that said they opposed \"any changes that would restrict eligible voters' access to the ballot\" in Texas. Companies like Microsoft Corp., American Airlines Group Inc. and Unilever PLC signed the statement. A second letter, sent Tuesday to Texas Speaker of the House Dade Phelan, was signed by some members of the Greater Houston Partnership, a business organization, that included 175 business executives, lawyers and other prominent Houstonians. </p><p>   Companies have struggled with how and whether to weigh in on changes to voting laws across the country, as some employees and customers who vocally oppose the laws pressure them, but also as some executives remain leery of getting drawn into political battles. </p><p>   In Texas, voting-rights groups and Democrats urged companies to oppose the state bill after it passed the Senate in April. American Airlines issued a statement on April 1 opposing it. On April 6,Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick publicly reprimanded the company and said it hadn't read the bill. A representative for American Airlines said it had read the bill. </p><p></p>",
