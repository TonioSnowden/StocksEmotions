  "text": "<p>In addition to government policy, India's short-term trajectory is determined by oil and monsoons; its long-term one by geography and demographics. But to really understand India's potential, you should watch the Indian diaspora. Joel Kotkin, an academic, produced research in the 1990s which suggested that “global tribes” shape the world and work to advantage their members. At present there are 32m Indians overseas (this includes Indian citizens who live abroad and also people of Indian ancestry who are neither citizens nor residents), and they sent back $87bn to India last year. In 2012 DataMonitor estimated that although the diaspora is equal in number to just 2% of India's population, its total wealth was approximately equivalent to half of India's GDP. Indians abroad are at least as wealthy now as then, if not wealthier. The message is clear: give Indians with initiative the right economic environment and they will thrive!</p><p>Though India's commercial links with the world are historic, in modern times the waves of immigrants were of small merchants and professionals. They voted with their feet, not to escape conflict or ethnic discrimination, but for greener economic pastures. The changes made in 1965 to America's Immigration and Nationality Act paved the way for Indians to make their mark in the country. Today they are the richest ethnic group, according to the US Census Bureau, with a median household income of $120,000, almost double the average in America. In many OECD countries, Indians are amongst the largest foreign-born populations: they are the largest in Britain and Canada, and the second-largest in America and Australia. Indian workers drive the Middle East's oil economy. And, at the same time, as Devesh Kapur of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore has shown, Indians constitute 8% of the world's top-tier AI researchers.</p><p>It took a few decades, but Indians now also lead global companies. California-based Indiaspora, a network for business executives of Indian origin, estimates that though the Indian diaspora makes up only 0.2% of the world's population, it constitutes 2% of the world's top business leaders. Deutsche Bank, Deloitte, Microsoft, Google, Chanel and many others have all had bosses of Indian heritage. Indians are equally prolific in the startup scene as well. A recent Stanford University study found that 90 of the 1,078 founders of 500 American unicorns (privately held startups worth at least $1bn) were born in India. People of Indian descent are also prominent politicians. Though Kamala Harris in America and Rishi Sunak in Britain are the most visible now, there are at least 30 people of partial Indian descent who have served as heads of state in countries as diverse as Singapore, Malaysia, Ireland, Guyana and Suriname.</p><p>Why does the success of the diaspora matter for India's future development? The British economist Angus Maddison computed that in 1600, India's GDP was 22.4% of world GDP. By 1870, it had fallen to 12.1%; today it is just over 3%. This happened not because India tripped and fell, but because it could not keep pace with the western world, which broke away from the pack as a result of the extraordinary productivity gains from the Industrial Revolution. Catching up has taken time because of colonialism and India's later flirtation with autarky, but it is finally happening. And India's diaspora can help.</p><p>First, Indians abroad will play a significant role in raising India's productivity and accelerating its prosperity through technology, trade and investments. Take the country's IT services sector as an example. Its exports were worth just $4m in 1980, but today amount to some $180bn annually. Without the spread of Indian tech professionals, this growth would not have happened. Second, the diaspora will continue to send back much needed remittances. Third, and most importantly, it will champion India's transition to a dynamic market economy; Indians abroad have benefited from free markets and are cheerleaders for foreign direct investment in India. That matters for India's middle-market companies (as it did for China's between 1980 and 2000) because they are the engine for job creation—an area in which India lags. A study in 2020 by McKinsey, a consultancy, found that it needs to add 90m non-farm jobs by 2030 to absorb all those who will enter the workforce in that time</p><p>The advantages the diaspora offers India come at a critical moment in the country's development. Its demographics mean a vast number of citizens will be of working age through to the middle of the century. Millions remain poor, but policymakers now know how to help them effectively. Between 2006 and 2016 India lifted 271m out of poverty according to the UN's multidimensional poverty measure, the second-best alleviation record in history (after China). For myriad ordinary Indians, small increases in salary mean large changes in disposable income proportionally, which could boost the development of an array of industries in India, ranging from insurance to household appliances.</p><p>All this creates a huge role for the diaspora. To ensure India's progress, its expatriates must be economic agents, ambassadors and influencers, all rolled into one. Yesterday's brain drain is today's economic advantage.</p><p>■</p><p>Gaurav Dalmia is a private-equity investor and the chairman of Dalmia Group Holdings, a holding company for corporate and financial assets in India and around the world.</p>",
