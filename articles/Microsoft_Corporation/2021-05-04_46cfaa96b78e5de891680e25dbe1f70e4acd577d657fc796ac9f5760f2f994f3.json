  "text": "<p>The letter says that Amazon may have violated antitrust and federal conflict-of-interest laws. \"We are concerned that Amazon may have attempted to monopolize one or more markets relating to government and/or commercial cloud computing services by improperly influencing the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure procurement process,\" the letter says.</p><p>Amazon didn't respond to requests for comment late Monday. The company previously has said that its cloud subsidiary received no preferential treatment.</p><p>Amazon has contested the 2019 decision awarding the JEDI contract to Microsoft, its largest cloud-computing rival. Amazon contends that it was treated unfairly in the JEDI procurement process, claiming that former President Donald Trump improperly influenced the outcome and steered the contract to another bidder. The Pentagon has denied those claims.</p><p>In their letter to Mr. Garland, Messrs. Lee and Buck point to what they say are undisclosed payments between an Amazon consultant and a Defense Department official. In another alleged conflict of interest, Messrs. Lee and Buck describe a different Defense Department official who had previously worked as a consultant for Amazon \"playing an integral role in drafting directives regarding the Department's cloud acquisition strategy\" despite being instructed to recuse himself from matters regarding Amazon.</p><p>Representatives for the Defense Department didn't respond to requests for comment late Monday.</p><p>---</p><p>John D.
