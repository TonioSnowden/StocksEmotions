Organizations will soon be able to apply for consideration, the website said.</p><p>\"Information from other people—other givers, my team, the non-profit teams I've been giving to—has been enormously helpful to me,\" Ms. Scott wrote in an essay published on the website Wednesday. \"If more information about these gifts can be helpful to anyone, I want to share it.\"</p><p>Ms. Scott is one of the richest women in the world, with a net worth of $21.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. She played an instrumental role in building Amazon.com Inc. with founder Jeff Bezos, her then-husband.
