  "title": "Broker Sold Top-End Homes and Knew Their Secrets; Jeff Hyland, who has died at age 74, founded a real-estate brokerage with Rick Hilton and wrote a book on Beverly Hills architecture",
  "text": "<p>Clients liked his encyclopedic knowledge of grand estates and the stories he could tell about dysfunctional Hollywood couples or reclusive billionaires who had lived in them.</p><p>In 2019, Mr. Hyland represented a buyer from Saudi Arabia in a roughly $120 million deal for The Manor, a Holmby Hills estate built by the television producer Aaron Spelling. The same year, he was involved in the $150 million sale of the Bel-Air house used as the Clampett residence in \"The Beverly Hillbillies.\"</p><p>He was especially fond of a Beverly Hills property known as Enchanted Hill. Mr. Hyland arranged a sale of the property in the late 1990s to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen for about $20 million. The home was torn down. Mr. Hyland's final major transaction was the recent resale of the property to Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, for $65 million.</p><p>Mr. Hyland died Feb. 16. He was 74 and had been under treatment for sarcoma.</p><p>His 2008 book, \"The Legendary Estates of Beverly Hills,\" celebrates his love of architecture and became a fixture on coffee tables in luxury homes. Among many other things, the book describes his first visit to Enchanted Hill, once home to screenwriter Frances Marion.</p><p>\"I found myself driving nearly half a mile to the main house,\" he wrote. \"I could not believe that such an estate existed in Beverly Hills.\" He admired the \"360-degree views over all of Los Angeles, extending to the Pacific Ocean.\"</p><p>Jeffrey Hyland was born July 1, 1947, and grew up in the Little Holmby neighborhood of Los Angeles, near Beverly Hills. His father, Dick Irving Hyland, was a screenwriter and literary agent.</p><p>As a boy at that time, \"you ran wild,\" Jeff Hyland recalled in a 2016 interview with the Real Deal. \"The doors were always unlocked, and you could ride your bikes on the roadâ€¦. All the Hollywood celebrities would wave, and you would wave back.\"</p><p>He studied hotel management at Cornell University before completing a business degree at United States International University, which later merged into Alliant International University.</p><p>One day in his late 20s, he told the Los Angeles Business Journal, \"I woke up and I just decided it was time to go to work.\" He got a job at Coldwell Banker. His first break came when his father introduced him to Dino De Laurentiis, a movie producer, who was shopping for a fancy home.</p><p>His inside knowledge paid off. \"Almost every house has a recognizable genealogy, even if the seller today isn't someone you and I would know,\" he said. \"When I say that Humphrey Bogart used to live in the house or that it had been leased by Elvis Presley, that adds a great cachet.\"</p><p>Mr. Hyland soon jumped to a boutique firm focused on luxury homes. He later helped found the brokerage Alvarez, Hyland &amp; Young and had a successful run there in the 1980s before co-founding Hilton &amp; Hyland. Mr. Hilton said he went into real estate with Mr. Hyland because \"I could see that he lived and breathed his work.\"</p><p>Luke Anderson, who worked for Mr. Hyland for about five years, said he liked to dig into archives to discover new details about old homes. He often retreated to his yacht to read but never planned to retire.</p><p>In a business that has drawn venture-capital backed brokerages branding themselves as tech companies, Mr. Hyland was part of an old guard valuing traditional building of relationships with potential clients. He could be seen lunching with clients at the Polo Lounge in the Beverly Hills Hotel or meeting friends at the Hillcrest Country Club, where he liked to swim laps.</p><p>He is survived by his wife, Lori Hyland, an abstract painter.</p><p>One of his pet sayings was that \"it's best to be the firstborn child, the second wife and the third listing agent.\" By the time a listing had worked its way to the third agent, sellers were ready to make a deal.</p><p>Write to James R.
