Special bonus payments and inventory reimbursements following its acquisition of Intel 's NAND business likely weighed on the South Korean memory-chip maker, while solid demand from data centers supported its earnings, they say. Daiwa expects 1Q operating profit at KRW3.3 trillion, higher than the market consensus forecast of KRW3.2 trillion. It cuts the stock's target 5.9% to KRW160,000 but maintains a buy rating, citing a likely 2H recovery in mobile chip demand. Shares rise 2.8% to KRW112,000. (kwanwoo.jun@wsj.com)</p><p>0203 GMT - The recent selloff in Win Semiconductors ' shares appears to be overdone, Daiwa analysts Rick Hsu and Elina Lin say in a note, and expect the resilient demand for 5G, Wi-Fi, 3-D and satellite communication to support earnings. The semiconductor company may also gain from growing adoption of augmented and virtual reality in tech devices as the metaverse trend continues to expand, they say. Daiwa upgrades the stock's rating to buy from outperform, but cuts target price to NT$285 from NT$355 to factor in a likely prolonged inventory correction of its power amplifiers. Shares are 0.9% higher at NT$228. (justina.lee@wsj.com)</p><p>2014 GMT - CEO Antonio Neri said HPE is in no rush to decide what to do with its minority interest in H3C Technologies. Ultimately, he said, HPE could sell its put option or renegotiate it. \"Now strategically, if you decide to exercise the put, you basically decided not to be in China,\" he said at an industry event. (maria.armental@wsj.com; @mjarmental)</p><p>2012 GMT - Chief Executive Antonio Neri says HPE has taken steps under HPE Next to prepare for whatever cyclicality may come, with an eye on efficiency and a free-cash-flow generation. This, he said, is a time when data is exploding, people need more insights from that data, they need to be digitized. So, he said at an industry event, \"We're going to see a little bit of divergence between IT spend and whatever the economic GDP data will tell us.\" (maria.armental@wsj.com; @mjarmental)</p><p>2010 GMT - HPE, anticipating challenges in fulfilling demand, began building inventory since 4Q20, including strategic buys in some areas for competitive advantage, CEO Antonio Neri said at an industry event. Overall, he said, inventory is now about nearly double what it would normally be. As inventory now goes down, free cash flow will go up and revenue and profit should follow the mix, he said, adding that HPE will continue to make some strategic buys. \"This is an opportunity to generate significant profit as we go forward in the next 4 to 8 quarters as we clean that backlog,\" Neri said. (maria.armental@wsj.com; @mjarmental)</p><p>2008 GMT - Hewlett Packard Enterprise ended 1Q with record backlog but company officials don't think that backlog has peaked yet. While there's been some progress with more capacity being added, current backlog and demand trends means that HPE will have \"a significant tailwind\" in the 2H22 and into 2023, CEO Antonio Neri said at an industry event. (maria.armental@wsj.com; @mjarmental)</p><p>1538 GMT - Tech giant Microsoft 's 4Q and FY23 revenue and EPS estimates are being lowered for FX and potential impact of the war in Ukraine despite expectations of sustained strength in the company's Office 365 franchises and cloud-computing service Azure, says Brad Sills and Adam Bergere, analysts at BofA Securities , in a research note. While CFO Amy Hood in early March said that no new sales were being made in Russia, the analysts say it is unclear if existing Azure or Office 365 subscription agreements will be halted. Analyst note the possibility of such an event considering this has been the case with Adobe , UiPath and Dynatrace . Shares are flat at $280.01. (denny.jacob@wsj.com; @pennedbyden)</p><p>1524 GMT - Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk says Twitter 's board of directors won't be paid if he succeeds in striking a deal to buy the social-media company. \"Board salary will be $0 if my bid succeeds, so that's $3M /year saved right there,\" Musk says in a tweet. It is not clear what the structure of Twitter 's board would look like if the billionaire successfully buys it and takes it private. Twitter spent about $2.9M in board compensation in 2021, though most of that was stock awards, according to a regulatory filing. (will.feuer@wsj.com)</p><p>1515 GMT - Even with tough comps in the short-term, Netflix remains a long-term durable growth story, Bank of America analysts say in a research note. The upcoming 2Q guidance will be driven by the return of highly viewed and rated shows like Stranger Things and lingering impact of the 1Q launch of Bridgerton, the bank says. \"We are, however, somewhat concerned that the Street is expecting too much from these in the seasonally weak 2Q,\" analysts write. The bank says it continues to see Netflix 's ability to grow as its global content investment strengthens its value proposition and maintains the stock at buy. First quarter results are set for release Tuesday. Shares down 1.8% to $335.03. (michael.dabaie@wsj.com)</p><p>1514 GMT - Verizon Communications joins a wave of companies meeting rising inflation with higher pay, raising its minimum wage for customer-service workers to $20 an hour. The telecom company says its bump to $20 also covers retail workers, though target commissions count toward that figure. Other job descriptions aren't part of the increase but are already covered by collective bargaining agreements. Two unions represented 24% of Verizon 's roughly 118,000 employees last year, according to its annual report.
