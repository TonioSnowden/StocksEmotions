  "text": "<p>    Amazon.com Inc. is adding a supply-chain management service to its web services business, jumping into a competitive technology field as companies try to get tighter control of the flow of goods from factories to consumers. </p><p>   Amazon's launch of its cloud application, AWS Supply Chain, adds Amazon to a growing list of software suppliers that help merchants juggle increasingly complex cargo flows and inventory demands. Microsoft Corp. launched its supply-chain management software platform in November. </p><p>   Many companies are pressing for greater efficiency and visibility of their goods flows after being caught flat-footed during the pandemic by disruptions such as factory shutdowns in Asia and U.S. port congestion that added months to import delivery times and led to empty shelves and lost sales heading into the 2021 holiday season. </p><p>   Amazon has a ready audience for its software with a phalanx of small- and medium-size businesses in its third-party marketplace. It says its application gives companies better visibility into their supply chains and that it uses machine learning to help manage inventory levels and better forecast demand. </p><p>   The software identifies risks and provides recommendations to guard against shortages and delays so companies can quickly \"respond to potential supply-chain disruptions,\" said Diego Pantoja-Navajas, vice president of AWS Supply Chain at Amazon Web Services. </p><p></p>",
