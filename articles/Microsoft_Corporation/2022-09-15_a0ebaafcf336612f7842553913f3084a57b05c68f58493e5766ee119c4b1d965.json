Financial markets have now fully priced in an interest rate increase of at least 75 basis points next Wednesday, with a one-in-five chance of a super-sized, 100-basis-point hike, according to CME 's FedWatch tool.</p><p>U.S. railroads remained open after the Biden administration helped broker a tentative deal with unions to avert a strike, thereby avoiding a rail shutdown which would add to supply-chain pressures at the core of hot inflation.</p><p>Shares of railroad operators Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern outperformed the broader market.</p><p>Adobe Inc tumbled after the company said it would buy Figma in a deal valued at about $20 billion.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 173.27 points, or 0.56%, to 30,961.82, the S&amp;P 500 lost 44.66 points, or 1.13%, to 3,901.35 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 167.32 points, or 1.43%, to 11,552.36.</p><p>Nine the 11 major sectors of the S&amp;P 500 ended the session in negative territory. Energy shares showed the largest percentage drop as the tentative rail agreement and demand concerns sent crude prices tumbling.</p><p>Healthcare posted the biggest advance with an assist from health insurer Humana Inc , whose 8.4% surge following its strong earnings forecast made it the top gainer in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Adobe Inc was the S&amp;P 500's biggest percentage loser, tumbling 16.8% after the company said it would buy Figma in a cash-and-stock deal that valued the online design startup at about $20 billion.</p><p>Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 2.79-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.35-to-1 ratio favored decliners.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 posted no new 52-week highs and 21 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 16 new highs and 206 new lows.</p><p>Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.11 billion shares, compared with the 10.35 billion average over the last 20 trading days.</p>",
