Watch our inaugural <em>DD: Dialogues</em> event on-demand <a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/377854\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Microsoft levels up with the world's largest tech deal</h2> <p>We knew <strong>Satya Nadella </strong>was looking for a monster deal. </p> <p>At first, it seemed like the chair and chief executive of <strong>Microsoft</strong> was more interested in social media. </p> <p>Back in 2020, Nadella made a move to buy the viral video app group <strong>TikTok</strong>, but that fell through. Then last year he tried scooping up<strong> Pinterest </strong>to no avail. Undeterred, he tried to bag chat start-up<strong> Discord</strong> but got rebuffed. </p> <p>Ultimately, the Hyderabad-born executive settled on voice recognition pioneer <strong>Nuance Communications </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a36dd469-e521-4ce7-9351-ddc8f6b5cb42\">for $16bn</a>, a deal that few found inspiring. Smart observers at the time told DD that Nadella wasn't finished yet.</p> <p>He didn't disappoint. On Tuesday Microsoft pulled out the big guns, agreeing to buy video game maker <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> for an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3726a3a-c4a0-4761-a82c-cda98abc3cb7\">equity value of $75bn</a> — the largest gaming deal in history by far.</p> <p>DD can only imagine that part of the thought process for the deal was: why go small when you're sitting on a $130bn cash pile? The reality is obviously a little more complex and detailed. </p> <p>Over the years, the company co-founded in 1975 by <strong>Bill Gates</strong> and <strong>Paul Allen</strong> has been transformed from a software-focused company to a diversified tech conglomerate ranging from cloud computing to social media and obviously gaming. </p> <p>Much of that diversification has occurred through big acquisitions including the 2011 takeover of <strong>Skype </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9461dbb4-7ab8-11e0-8762-00144feabdc0\">for $8.5bn</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/931c2ade-3165-11e6-ad39-3fee5ffe5b5b\">$26bn purchase</a> of <strong>LinkedIn</strong> five years later. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8438513.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Gaming isn't new to Microsoft. At the turn of the century, it launched the gaming console <strong>Xbox</strong> to compete with <strong>Nintendo</strong> and <strong>Sony</strong>. But the industry has moved online, with subscription plans and original content at the forefront as players hunt for deals to propel them <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76d40aac-034e-4e0b-95eb-c5d34146f647\">into the metaverse</a>, aka the immersive virtual worlds that the big tech companies are racing to build. </p> <p>Microsoft began to catch on, acquiring <strong>ZeniMax</strong>, the gaming group behind major franchises such as <em>Fallout</em> and <em>Doom</em>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74f3ca26-373c-4afb-89a9-ec4c1a94c0f5\">for $7.5bn</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Activision, with its rich content portfolio of brands like <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em>, will help the tech giant gain a further edge on rivals including <strong>Take-Two Interactive</strong>, the maker of the popular <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>game series that agreed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2b100b6-2916-4d0d-b23e-f0dd240757aa\">buy rival <strong>Zynga</strong> </a>for $12.7bn last week. &#xa0;</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8438727.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The deal wouldn't only push Microsoft ahead in gaming, but help it carve out a sizeable plot in the metaverse land grab, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09bdeb82-7462-48c1-ab28-6c9ad34a1719\">Lex notes</a>.</p> <p>It all seems pretty logical, in the grand scheme of things. But one obstacle Nadella could be underestimating is antitrust.</p> <p>After US president <strong>Joe Biden</strong> appointed Big Tech adversaries <strong>Lina Khan </strong>and <strong>Tim Wu</strong> to senior positions within his administration, it was assumed that Microsoft and its competitors at <strong>Google</strong>,<strong> Amazon</strong> and <strong>Facebook</strong> would steer clear of large-scale M&amp;A.</p> <p>Microsoft's play for Activision will test whether the current administration can successfully square off against Big Tech, and win. </p> <h2>The endless mess at Credit Suisse</h2> <p>In the 2021 Wimbledon men's singles final, vaccine sceptic <strong>Novak Djokovic </strong>claimed the trophy over <strong>Matteo Berrettini</strong> in the fourth set when his opponent missed a final backhand slice. </p> <p><strong>António Horta-Osório</strong>, the now-former <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> chair who watched from the sidelines in London despite the 10-day quarantine rule imposed on Swiss travellers at the time, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48d159bd-a3c0-4025-8c5b-d7dfbf59526a\">suffered a similar defeat</a> thanks to his own unforced errors.</p> <p>After vowing to turn round the scandal-hit lender in the aftermath of twin crises at <strong>Archegos</strong> and <strong>Greensill</strong>, the Portuguese banker was informed this week that the Credit Suisse board, which he had chaired for just over eight months, no longer supported him after repeated Covid-19 quarantine breaches.</p> <p>It's the second high-profile departure of a top leader at the bank in two years, following <strong>Tidjane Thiam</strong>'s ousting as CEO in the wake of a corporate espionage scandal in 2020.</p> <p>Horta-Osório ultimately resigned, a person close to him <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d3d874f-7330-491b-a974-5252a9107578\">told the FT</a>, when he learnt this past Sunday afternoon that less than half of the directors indicated they would be willing to back him in light of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e6cf414-6454-4831-90a0-59f08d2f4be9\">his indiscretions</a>. They included the tennis excursion and a trip to a luxury resort in the Maldives on the company's corporate jet.</p> <p><strong>Axel Lehmann</strong>, the Credit Suisse board member and former UBS executive who has been drafted in as his replacement, inherits a bank and boardroom in disarray. Horta-Osório had orchestrated a power grab just months after joining as chair, sowing tensions with CEO <strong>Thomas Gottstein</strong> as he expanded his own office and took a direct role in decision making.</p> <p>With his position safe for now, Gottstein may get a second shot at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70ae2c44-d14e-4a1e-bd06-266518a8df2c\">“clean slate”</a> he had bargained for last year. That's if he can finally sweep over the extensive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a6be4fc-5102-4bd2-9bf3-f27dd9957c6f\">laundry list</a> of scandals the bank has endured over the past decade.</p> <p>As for Horta-Osório, he'll get a SFr3.8m ($4.1m) <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc178832-7d3f-4b8f-bf12-901c26a18aea\">leaving package</a> — three-quarters of what he would have been entitled to annually — to tide him over until he makes his next move.</p> <p>Lehmann and Gottstein's first order of business, if you ask DD? </p> <p>Finishing what Horta-Osório started when he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2573a6c2-284b-477a-a25d-8ceaa0b5c80b\">vowed to overhaul</a> the bank's pay policy. The last thing they want is for its risk managers and attorneys to stray elsewhere.</p> <h2>David Solomon's 2022 forecast: ‘wage inflation everywhere'</h2> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>bankers rang in the new year with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51c4638b-2663-4fa2-9fa3-8608d488d227\">huge bonuses</a> following a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6dfdd78a-e229-4524-a400-144396524eb6\">record-breaking</a> year for dealmaking. But lacklustre earnings quickly sullied the mood on Tuesday, as the bank's stock plunged by 7 per cent.</p> <p>“There's no question that inflationary pressures around compensation had an impact,” said the bank's CEO <strong>David Solomon</strong> <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/83fea40d-eae7-4386-be34-013ed963589ec\">in an interview</a> with the FT's Josh Franklin, warning of “wage inflation everywhere”.</p> <p>Net profit fell 13 per cent year-on-year in the last three months of 2021 — a drop surpassing analysts' expectations. Meanwhile, bonuses were up 31 per cent on the year, more than the $2.9bn analysts had originally predicted, while annual salary expenses were up 22 per cent.</p> <p>It's hardly a surprise the Wall Street bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6257d2ba-781e-4b70-b8f0-c4cfeb6bca66\">spent vast sums on its employees</a> in the fourth quarter, as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b33f3645-ff93-4309-a575-f92641faaa43\">reckoning</a> over junior pay and discourse surrounding <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f5d2587-d9a7-4cd5-ac84-e36d75b13a24\">mental health issues</a> put Goldman's much-touted “pay for performance” culture to the test.</p> <p>Also fuelling the drop in Goldman's stock on Tuesday was an underwhelming performance by the bank's trading division. After a banner 2020 thanks to heavy trading during the pandemic, revenue was down 7 per cent at $3.98bn year-on-year. That's below analysts' forecasts of $4.3bn.</p> <p>Solomon has put on a brave face nonetheless. “If you're a student of the history of Goldman Sachs,” he said, “every time the firm has an extraordinary year, people say it will never be better . . . and there's always a time when it's better.”</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Law firm<strong> Paul Weiss </strong>has hired <strong>Kenneth Ziman</strong> as a partner in its restructuring practice, based in New York.
