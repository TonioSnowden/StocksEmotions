  "title": "S&P 500 Turns Higher, Despite Declines Among Big Tech Stocks; Facebook parent Meta Platforms is scheduled to post results after the market close",
  "text": "<p>That helped outweigh big losses in shares of Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet after lackluster results from the two tech giants.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gained 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.8%, or about 265 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.3%.</p><p>Stocks have gotten a boost in recent days, lifted by some better-than-expected corporate earnings and hopes that the Federal Reserve may reduce the pace of interest-rate increases. The rally propelled the Dow industrials to a six-week high on Tuesday.</p><p>One factor contributing to the optimistic outlook: With the S&amp;P 500 down 19% this year, stocks look less expensive than they have during much of the Covid-19 pandemic. That suggests better potential returns going forward.</p><p>\"We're not at slam-dunk valuation levels yet but we're in a much better place now than we were at the beginning of the year,\" said Andy Braun, senior portfolio manager at Impax Asset Management.</p><p>The more bullish sentiment of recent days darkened after Alphabet and Microsoft reported their quarterly results Tuesday. The disappointing reports from two of the market's most influential stocks exacerbated concerns about slowing economic growth.</p><p>\"These companies are really important bellwethers on advertising and on flows of goods and services,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. \"If advertising growth is slowing over there, it is adding weight to that fear of an earnings slowdown.\"</p><p>Shares of Alphabet were recently down 6.4%. The company's revenue growth last quarter dropped to the lowest level in more than two years and its YouTube video platform posted a drop in advertising sales for the first time.</p><p>Microsoft shares, meanwhile, declined 5.5% after the company reported its weakest revenue growth in more than five years and said it expects a sharp decline in personal computer sales.</p><p>\"We've gotten used to tech being strong in every single quarter. There was hope that they would be so sharp that it would be another signal that tech is resilient,\" said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank.</p><p>Earnings reports are due after the close from Meta Platforms and Ford Motor.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged down to 4.016% from 4.109% Tuesday.</p><p>The dollar weakened, with the WSJ Dollar Index down 0.9%.</p><p>Recent dollar selling by the Bank of Japan and Chinese state-owned banks to support their currencies is a likely driver of the dollar weakness, said Jordan Rochester, a foreign-exchange strategist at Nomura. \"A warmer October in Europe, the natural-gas market softening and some positivity for the European winter are also helping.\" The dollar is often bought as a haven in times of stress.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7%.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks rose. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.8% and Japan's Nikkei 225 added 0.7%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1%, regaining some ground after the index suffered its worst one-day drop since the global financial crisis earlier in the week.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Karen Langley at karen.langley@wsj.com</p><p>S&amp;P 500 Turns Higher, Despite Declines Among Big Tech Stocks</p>",
