  "title": "REVIEW --- The Bunk of Generational Talk --- It's time to drop the silly stereotypes about Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials and Gen Z and discuss the real issues faced by each age group.",
  "text": "<p>These stereotypes generate endless satire on social media. The hashtag #millennialproblems collects fake tweets that play to the absurdity of the cliches, such as \"I cut my finger slicing open an avocado and now I can't fix my topknot.\" Two American 20-year-olds set up a Facebook group where \"we all pretend to be boomers,\" which has nearly 300,000 members, with content that's a mix of capitalized political rants (\"MY GRANDSON FORGOT TO CALL ME ON MY BIRTHDAY. THANKS OBAMA\"), disgusting medical queries (\"Good home remedies for anal tremors?\") and incompetent use of graphics (\"I'm losing custody of the kids,\" above an image of party balloons).</p><p>Most of this is just good fun, of course. But such stereotypes, myths and contrived conflicts can be genuinely destructive when they stand in the way of a real understanding of generational differences, which shape our attitudes and behaviors on many key issues: religion, sexual activity, smoking, drinking alcohol, connection to political parties and trust in other people.</p><p>Our wrongheaded thinking about generations leads us to focus on the wrong problems. Headlines about spendthrift young people, for example, distract us from the huge shift in economic policy in recent decades toward the interests of older people. We avoid facing up to a challenge like climate change by laying the blame on older generations while placing our expectations for salvation on the coming generation. Across a range of issues, manufacturing fake generational battles denies us the benefits of intergenerational connection and solidarity.</p><p>For the 19th-century French sociologist Auguste Comte, the generation was a key factor in \"the basic speed of human development.\" \"We should not hide the fact that our social progress rests essentially upon death; which is to say that the successive steps of humanity necessarily require a continuous renovation . . . from one generation to the next,\" Comte wrote. Generations differ from one another, and that's a good thing, since it prevents society turning into a \"stagnant pond.\"</p><p>But to see the true value of generational thinking, we need to discard the clickbait headlines and bad research. Consider, for example, the idea that young people today are fickle employees, prone to switching jobs casually. A 2017 article in Forbes examined \"Millennials and the Death of Loyalty.\" It is true that younger people change jobs more often than older people -- but that's always been true, and young people today are no more flighty than in the past. In fact, it's older workers who are moving more frequently than past generations, and if anything the young are holding on to their jobs tighter than in the past, given the tougher economic environment. Similarly, it's true that young people today work fewer hours than they did in the past, but that's because the working hours of all age groups have seen a long-term decline.</p><p>The idea that Millennials are particularly obsessed by material concerns has been endlessly repeated since a 2013 Time magazine cover called them the \"Me, Me, Me Generation.\" In her 2017 book \"iGen,\" psychologist Jean Twenge wrote that young people today \"are very interested in becoming well-off and less focused on meaning than previous generations.\" This has stuck with the public. In a global online survey of 20,000 people across 30 countries that I conducted with the research firm Ipsos, the second most popular adjective picked out to describe Gen Z was \"materialistic\" (behind \"tech-savvy\").</p><p>But this misreads the reality. The European Social Survey found that young people are around twice as likely as older people to say it's important to them to be rich, but that's more a feature of youth than a true generational difference. The survey also shows that Millennials attached less importance to material ambitions as they got older, just as Gen X did before them. Mixing up lifecycle and generation effects creates lazy headlines based on fake differences.</p><p>Our generational stereotypes are also riven with contradictions. While one myth claims the young only care about cash, another paints them as a new breed of social justice warriors. But their behavior as consumers doesn't bear out this reputation. According to the European Social Survey, it's actually Baby Boomers who are most likely to have boycotted a company in the last 12 months, with Gen Z about half as likely. By this measure at least, \"cancel culture\" is more of a middle-aged thing.</p><p>It is true that young people are at the leading edge of change in cultural norms around race, immigration, sexuality and gender identity. For example, eight in 10 members of Gen Z say there is nothing wrong with sexual relations between people of the same sex, compared with around three in 10 of those born before World War II. But older people have always fretted about the different cultural norms of young people. In 400 B.C., Socrates moaned about the youth of his day and their \"bad manners, contempt for authority, disrespect for elders.\" Young people are less set in their ways and more comfortable with change than older people; as Comte understood, that's how societies avoid going stale.</p><p>The gaps between young and old on emergent cultural issues today are no larger than gaps in the past. Indeed, in many cases there were bigger gaps between Baby Boomers in their youth and their parents than we see between young and old today. For example, in 1990, over 60% of people born before World War II agreed that it was \"much better for everyone if the man was the achiever outside the home and the woman takes care of the home and family,\" while under 30% of Baby Boomers agreed. Today's cohort of young people isn't unusual. What's really changed is the more fractious political and media context: The internet and social media have given us the tools to communicate our differences at scale.</p><p>Among the more destructive generational myths is the idea that older generations don't care about climate change and the fate of the planet. It has crept into so many discussions that it's become an accepted truth. When Time magazine named Greta Thunberg their person of the year in 2019, they called her a \"standard-bearer in a generational battle.\" The singer Billie Eilish was more direct in an interview with the music magazine NME: \"Hopefully the adults and the old people start listening to us [about climate change]. Old people are gonna die and don't really care if we die, but we don't wanna die yet.\"</p><p>But this stereotype collapses when you look at the evidence. A recent survey by New Scientist magazine and King's College London found that around six in 10 Americans in all age groups say that climate change, biodiversity loss and other environmental issues are big enough problems that they justify significant changes to people's lifestyles. In fact, younger people are most pessimistic about the impact they themselves can have in tackling climate change. Among Baby Boomers, 53% disagree with the idea that changing their behavior is pointless, as compared with 34% of Millennials.</p><p>The unthinking ageism that has crept into much of the discussion about climate change is a serious problem, given the growing demographic weight and financial power of the older population. Exaggerating the differences between generations on climate is a self-defeating approach to a potentially existential challenge. If we want a greener future, we will need to act together, uniting the generations rather than trying to divide them.</p><p>Generational myths are also dangerous because they distract us from true changes caused by the undeniably tougher economic circumstances facing younger generations. Baby Boomers enjoyed significantly improved incomes in middle age, earning around 25% more compared with the Silent Generation (born 1928 to 1945) when both cohorts were 45 to 49 years old. But Gen Xers had 5% lower real incomes than Boomers when they were 45 to 49, while Millennials earned 5% less than Gen Xers at 30 to 34.</p><p>The wealth gap between generations is even more dramatic. When Baby Boomers were in their mid-40s, they owned 40% of all wealth in the U.S., but when Gen X reached the same average age, they only owned around 15%, according to a 2019 analysis of Federal Reserve data by economist Gray Kimbrough. A large part of the difference can be explained by the long boom in housing prices and the changing profile of home ownership. In the U.S., Millennials are around half as likely as Baby Boomers to be homeowners. As a result, people in developed countries increasingly doubt that today's young people will be better off than their parents. The proportion of Americans who think it's unlikely their kids will have a better future rose from 25% in 1999 to 40% by 2019.</p><p>It's not just economic factors at play in this gloomy assessment. There is also a real difference between generations in the frequency of mental health disorders, particularly among young women. A 2019 study by Dr. Twenge shows that the proportion of U.S. adolescents reporting symptoms consistent with major depression in the last 12 months increased from 8.7% in 2005 to 13.2% in 2017. There were no corresponding increases among other age groups over this period, suggesting that the cause might lie in the growing centrality of smartphones and social media among the young. And early signs are that the Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced this gap. For example, a shocking 40% of 18 to 21-year-olds in the U.K. reported mental health conditions in January 2021, much higher than other age groups.</p><p>When there is such richness in the realities, why are there so many myths? It's partly a product of a new mini-industry of generational market research and consulting, which plays to executives' anxiety that they don't have their fingers on the pulse. In 2016 The Wall Street Journal reported that, by one estimate, U.S. companies spent up to $70 million on \"generational consulting\" the previous year, while more than 400 LinkedIn users described themselves solely as a \"Millennial expert\" or \"Millennial consultant.\"</p><p>Politicians also play to generational differences, with Barack Obama repeatedly lionizing coming generations as more focused on equality. In his autobiography \"A Promised Land,\" Mr. Obama writes that he remains hopeful because of his faith in his fellow citizens, \"especially those of the next generation, whose conviction in the equal worth of all people seems to come as second nature, and who insist on making real those principles that their parents and teachers told them were true but perhaps never fully believed themselves.\" The evidence does not suggest such a clean break.</p><p>The problem with such statements isn't the idea of generational difference itself but rather how generational labels are applied. A more accurate understanding of those differences would help to reduce conflict at home, at work and in politics. It would remind us that generations don't have utterly distinct and unchanging characteristics. People and societies change over the long term in ways that no stereotype about age cohorts can begin to capture.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Duffy is a professor of public policy and director of the Policy Institute at King's College London.
