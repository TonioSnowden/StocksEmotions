  "text": "<p>* Most U.S. public companies currently lack board directors with professional experience of cybersecurity.</p><p>* According to WSJ Pro Research, 86 directors representing 91 S&amp;P 500 companies have professional experience in cybersecurity.</p><p>* Seven S&amp;P 500 board directors have served in chief information security officers roles though only two currently serve as CISOs.</p><p>Background</p><p>In March 2022, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rules that would require public companies to make standardized disclosures on cybersecurity risk management, strategy, governance, and incident reporting. Under the proposed rules companies would need to disclose at least annually whether their board directors have expertise in cybersecurity.</p><p>'Expertise' is not defined by the SEC, however according to the proposed rule: \"if any member of the board has cybersecurity expertise, the registrant would have to disclose the name(s) of any such director(s), and provide such detail as necessary to fully describe the nature of the expertise.\"</p><p>Research Findings</p><p>WSJ Pro Research analyzed the professional backgrounds of 4,621 board directors representing S&amp;P 500 companies and found only 86 directors (1.9%) had relevant professional experience of cybersecurity in the last 10 years. Together, those directors hold 100 board seats at 91 companies representing 18.2% of the S&amp;P 500. Although the rule does not require boards to have cybersecurity expertise, investors may view the lack or absence of expertise as a negative indicator for the board's oversight of cyber risk.</p><p>Experience is most concentrated in financial services, where 25 directors serve on 24 corporate boards, and information technology, where 25 directors serve on 20 corporate boards. Nine companies â€“ Akamai Technologies Inc., Arista Networks Inc., CMS Energy Corp., DXC Technology Co., F5 Inc., Iron Mountain Inc., Juniper Networks Inc., Lockheed Martin Corp. and Regions Financial Corp. each had two directors with cybersecurity experience.</p><p>Seven S&amp;P 500 board directors (0.15%) have held a chief information security officer role, of whom only two (0.04%) are currently CISOs. Michael Montoya is SVP and CISO at digital infrastructure company Equinix Inc. and serves on the board of F5, and Noopur Davis is EVP, CISO and chief product privacy officer at Comcast Corp. and serves on the board of Regions Financial.</p><p>Of the 86 directors with cybersecurity experience, 38% were professionally active in cybersecurity roles during 2022 and likely have the most up-to-date understanding of cyber risk issues. Sixty-nine percent were professionally active during the last five years.</p><p>Profiles</p><p>The individual directors fell broadly into three categories:</p><p>* Seventy-three directors have direct professional experience in information security, information technology or other applicable roles. For example, CMS Energy board director Myrna Soto was previously chief information officer at MGM Resorts International and global CISO at Comcast Corp. In addition to other board directorships, Ms. Soto is founder &amp; CEO of Apogee Executive Advisors LLC, a consultancy advising on technology risk management and cybersecurity among other topics.</p><p>* Nine S&amp;P 500 company board directors have experience of having led a cybersecurity company. Microsoft Corp. Executive Vice President of Business Development Christopher Young, a board member at American Express Co. since 2018, was chief executive of cybersecurity company McAfee Corp., a role he held for three years until 2020.</p><p>* Among the four directors with experience working in a cybersecurity leadership role in a government, military or intelligence agency is Suzanne Vautrinot, president of Kilovolt Consulting Inc., a cybersecurity strategy and technology consulting firm. Ms. Vautrinot is a retired major general of the United States Air Force and served as the director of plans and policy at U.S. Cyber Command. She currently sits on the boards of CSX Corp., Ecolab Inc. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co., among others.</p><p>Methodology and Caveats</p><p>The list of directors was compiled using data provided by FactSet and was accurate as of Nov. 1, 2022. The research analyzed publicly available biographies and career histories from FactSet and corporate board websites, as well as the LinkedIn profiles of directors. Directors were only included if their applicable experience was included in professional profiles or the experience was gathered through disclosed memberships of specialist organizations.</p><p>'Expertise' is difficult to define in the context of cybersecurity. This research uses executive-level experience as being indicative of expertise, though it is not definitive. For example, a director who worked as a chief information officer likely had significant exposure to cybersecurity, but this is not guaranteed. They may have devolved responsibility to a direct report, they may have not stayed in the role long enough to get a grasp of the issues, or they may not have been concerned by cybersecurity. The research cannot speak to the breadth and depth of an individual's knowledge or the ability of the individual to apply that knowledge in their board work.</p><p>Some directors may have gathered considerable experience of cybersecurity through dealing with incidents at their organization, from working on government policy groups, or from board advisors and mentoring by industry experts. If the expertise is undisclosed in professional profiles and biographies, it was not included in this research.</p><p>Although we found a total of 107 directors with experience fitting one of the three profiles, we took the decision to omit 21 of them because their experience was gained before 2012. From 2012 onwards, governments became more open about briefing the private sector on cybersecurity threats and new strategies emerged to mitigate technology risks. Retaining expertise and remaining well-informed in cybersecurity while not being professionally active in the field requires considerable effort.</p><p>WSJ Pro Research is a premium membership that supports executive decision making on critical business issues by supplementing the news with timely, in-depth research and data.</p><p>Meet the Author</p><p>Analyzing Board-Level Cybersecurity Experience</p>",
