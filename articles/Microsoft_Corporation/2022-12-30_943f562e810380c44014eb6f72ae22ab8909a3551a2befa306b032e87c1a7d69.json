  "text": "<p>Top Republicans were unwilling to consider any immigration-related changes amid an unprecedented surge of illegal immigration at the border, with some previously bipartisan proposals shedding GOP support as this year's congressional session came to a close. Fears over the border were amplified by the impending termination of Title 42, a pandemic-era border policy allowing migrants to be rapidly turned back to Mexico. That policy was set to expire last week but was held up by the Supreme Court, which announced it would hear a case on the policy.</p><p>Concern over the policy was so great that a GOP amendment requiring the Biden administration to keep Title 42 in place briefly stalled the spending package, threatening a potential government shutdown before congressional leaders brokered a workaround.</p><p>\"When the border is on fire, it's really hard to come together and cut a deal and limit the more extreme voices on the far right and the far left,\" said Matthew La Corte, government affairs manager for immigration policy at the Niskanen Center, a center-right-leaning think tank. \"Until the politics of fixing the immigration system outweigh the politics of border chaos, I think we're going to be in this no-man's-land.\"</p><p>Among the failed proposals were bills offering a path to citizenship for farmworkers in the country illegally, for Afghans evacuated to the U.S. last year after the Taliban retook power and for Dreamers, the immigrants here unlawfully who were brought to the country as children. Another proposal would have significantly shortened the wait for Indians caught in a green-card backlog that some analysts estimate could last decades.</p><p>Prospects for reform will only grow tougher in the next two years as Republicans take over the House, where Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), the expected next speaker, has said he won't take up any immigration bills unless they deal first with bolstering border security. Republicans are also expected to make the Biden administration's handling of border flows a subject of oversight hearings next year.</p><p>\"There's an increasing number of Democrats who recognize they actually do have a crisis at the border,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis (R., N.C.), who led bipartisan negotiations with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I., Ariz.) over a potential deal to create a path to citizenship for Dreamers. Those negotiations petered out in the last couple of weeks amid tepid support from Mr. Tillis's Republican colleagues in the Senate.</p><p>Mr. Tillis didn't rule out reviving the talks in the next Congress. But, he said, \"It's going to be necessarily more conservative on border security than we would have been able to negotiate this cycle because now we've got a divided Congress.\"</p><p>Ms. Sinema and Mr. Tillis's compromise framework would have provided a path to citizenship for approximately two million Dreamers, in exchange for new border measures including increasing mandatory detention for some migrants who cross the border illegally and a continuation of Title 42.</p><p>They were moved to act after a federal appeals court ruled in October that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which offers Dreamers temporary deportation protections, was unlawful. But other Senate Republicans said that any kind of legalization program would be a nonstarter.</p><p>Separately, Sens. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) and Michael Crapo (R., Idaho) held months of talks over a proposed agricultural immigration deal that would provide a legalization pathway for a million farmworkers in the country illegally in exchange for an expanded farmworker visa program and mandatory use of E-Verify for agricultural employers. A similar bill passed the House last year with 30 Republicans voting in favor. But by early December, talks bogged down and Mr. Bennet introduced a bill without his Republican counterpart.</p><p>Another bill, known as the Afghan Adjustment Act, would have provided a permanent legal status for some 80,000 Afghans evacuated to the U.S. who currently must apply for asylum or be vulnerable to future deportation. The proposal was co-sponsored by several Republicans, including Sens. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and Roy Blunt (R., Mo.), but it couldn't overcome the opposition of GOP leaders including Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which has purview over immigration matters. Republicans opposed to the bill have said it wouldn't adequately vet applicants before giving them permanent residence, and some Republicans oppose the idea of issuing so many blanket green cards at all.</p><p>And a bill championed by tech companies, including Google and Microsoft, which would lift the cap on green cards that can be issued to applicants from any one country to help Indian and some Chinese applicants caught in the backlog, stalled in the House as Democratic leaders tried and failed to corral enough support.</p><p>Conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation forcefully lobbied against the bill, arguing that it could allow some members of the Chinese Communist Party to receive faster green cards, even though anyone belonging to a Communist Party is barred from immigrating to the U.S. And some Democrats expressed concern that allocating more green cards to Indian and Chinese applicants would force others, such as those from Africa or the Caribbean, to wait longer.</p><p>Siobhan Hughes and Lindsay Wise contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Michelle Hackman at michelle.hackman@wsj.com</p><p>Partisan Splits Scuttle Year-End Action on Immigration Policy</p>",
