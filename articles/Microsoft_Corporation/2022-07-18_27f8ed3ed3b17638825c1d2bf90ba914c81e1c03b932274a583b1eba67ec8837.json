Her latest book is ‘Redesigning Work'</em> </p> <p>If you are both amazed and horrified by how many meetings are being crammed into our working days — you are not alone. Data from Microsoft research show that since the start of the pandemic, the number of meetings has risen by 50 per cent. It seems that our default on any task is to use that simple button to schedule a virtual meeting — and we are doing this multiple times a day.</p> <p>As a psychologist who studies work, I could tell you that this highly scheduled way of working is likely to reduce your daily productivity. That's because you are inadvertently squeezing out the time you need to be disconnected and alone. By doing so, you are limiting your capacity to focus undisturbed on more valuable tasks that require deeper concentration.</p> <p>My guess is that you are already aware of this, and perhaps you are currently making efforts to create more meeting-less, undisturbed time in your daily schedule. But the “work by meetings” ethos has another, potentially more damaging impact.</p> <p>While from a business perspective we might understand what drives our work performance, when it comes to our broader lives we suffer from “affective forecasting”. We are generally poor at predicting those activities that generate long-term positive benefits. And this poor forecasting capacity is particularly working against us now as we reach again for the scheduling button, assuming that another meeting will be a valuable activity. </p> <p>By doing so we are losing the opportunity to engage in an activity that can in the longer term bring profound value: the activity of building and sustaining friendships with others. By pressing that scheduling button for our next virtual meeting, we are taking away time from that messy, unpredictable business of making friends.</p> <p>When we make friends, we strengthen our resilience. We are also making the time we spend at work more pleasurable. Take, for example, Gallup polling which puts “I have a best friend at work” as one of the best predictors of whether you will stay in your current job. This resonates with me.</p> <p>I have a close friend at work. I trust her with my innermost worries, we celebrate our successes, commiserate on life's failures, we blow off steam and share our experiences. In a life which frankly feels chaotic at times, our friendship has been sustaining and nurturing.</p> <p>It seems that while our “affective forecasting” on the value of giving time to friendships might be poor, when we experience friendship, we really feel its value.</p> <p>The call to prioritise time to invest in friendships (rather than meetings) couldn't be more important as we move out of the pandemic. Locked at home and often moving to virtual communications, we've missed the pleasure of spontaneously catching up with friends at work.</p> <p>Now is the time to rekindle those friendships — and here are three ways you can do this.</p> <p>Start by ignoring your poor affective forecasting predictions and remind yourself that, though messy and unpredictable, investing your time in building and sustaining friendships might be one of the best decisions you make. That decision could mean giving time to reaching out and rekindling old friendships, perhaps those that faded away during the pandemic. Or it could mean opening up to new possible friendships.</p> <p>To do that you have to take a second action: rid yourself of those endless virtual meetings, with their brisk pace and streamlined agendas. Now is the opportunity to give yourself the best gift you can — the gift of time.</p> <p>And finally, recall the memories of friendships that mean the most to you. For me it's the time I left the office and walked in the park talking with a friend about our life, sharing a simple meal after a long day, puzzling together over what seemed like an intractable business task we faced. Looking back, it is often these shared experiences that are our most cherished memories of friendships. So now is the time to create these shared experiences — working in cross-functional projects, volunteering, helping others.</p> <p>I recall a conversation about friendship with my friend Robert Waldinger. Robert directs the Harvard Study of Adult Development which has followed a group of adults over 84 years and has shown the extraordinary impact of friendship on life happiness and vitality.</p> <p>As he remarked, “The power of generosity is being deeply curious about the other, listening to your friend's stories, hearing their opinions and feeling the thrill of being understood by another.”</p> <p>As we move from the virtual to the real, let's be sure we give time to our friendships — and by doing so, experience that thrill for ourselves. </p><p>Source: Lynda Gratton 2022 'Cut the meetings, make more friends' FT.com 18 July.
