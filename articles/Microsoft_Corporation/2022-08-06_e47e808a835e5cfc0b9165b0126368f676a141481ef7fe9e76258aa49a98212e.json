  "text": "<p>\n  RICHARD TAIT </p><p>\n  1964-2022 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  On a rainy afternoon in the late 1990s, Richard Tait and his wife at the time, Karen Fries, were visiting friends in the Hamptons. When the two couples played Pictionary, a game that involves drawing pictures, \"we crushed them,\" Mr. Tait recalled in a podcast. </p><p>\n  When they played Scrabble, however, \"they crushed us.\" Mr. Tait felt like a chump. </p><p>\n  \"Why,\" he asked, \"isn't there a game that has something in it for everyone?\" </p><p>\n  Mr. Tait, a Scottish-born computer scientist who had recently left Microsoft Corp. after a decade as a fast-rising executive there, had been looking for a business idea. With a former Microsoft colleague, Whit Alexander, he founded a company to create the Cranium board game, designed to make everyone feel smart, at least part of the time, by challenging various parts of the brain. </p><p>\n  The game caught on and spawned numerous derivatives for Seattle-based Cranium Inc. In 2008, Hasbro Inc. agreed to buy Cranium for about $77.5 million. That allowed Mr. Tait to chase other entrepreneurial ideas, and to work as a consultant at Starbucks Corp. </p><p>\n  Mr. Tait died July 25 at the age of 58. The cause was complications of Covid-19, said Amy Paron, his fiancee. </p><p>\n  Finding a market for Cranium challenged Mr. Tait. By the time he was ready to ship Cranium games in 1998, the company had missed the New York Toy Fair and couldn't get space on toy-store shelves. </p><p>\n  While lamenting his bad luck over coffee at a Starbucks cafe, he said later, \"I looked up and saw all of our target audience standing in line. We called them dating yupsters.\" Starbucks happened to be interested in offering games and agreed to stock Cranium. </p><p>\n  Mr. Tait flew across the country to meet buyers for the Barnes &amp; Noble bookstores, only to be told the chain wasn't interested. Rather than retreating in a huff, he begged two managers at the chain to try the game. Soon Cranium was on sale at Barnes &amp; Noble. </p><p>\n  Mr. Tait got the game on the shelves of Virgin record stores by dashing to a book signing by Richard Branson, that chain's founder, and pitching him on the spot. </p><p>\n  He rarely missed an opportunity to make a connection -- introducing himself to strangers on elevators or in airplanes and chatting with taxi drivers. He was so inspired by the motivationalbook \"Orbiting the Giant Hairball\" that he cold-called the author, Gordon MacKenzie, and created an enduring friendship. </p><p>\n  Richard John Tait was born Jan. 17, 1964, near Dundee, Scotland, and later lived inHelensburgh, Scotland. His father, an engineer, was a manufacturing executive for Polaroid Corp. </p><p>\n  While delivering morning newspapers, young Richard smelled the aromas of breakfast at many homes. That sparked an idea: Why not offer to deliver bacon sandwiches along with the news? He later told the Scotsman newspaper that the diversification \"managed to drive the margins up in my business hugely.\" </p><p>\n  After studying computer science at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, he developed software to help people choose home computers and printers but didn't believe he would find venture capital in Scotland. Advised that his prospects would be better in America, he enrolled at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business and earned an M.B.A. degree. </p><p>\n  Microsoft recruited him as an assistant project manager in 1988. He ascended the ranks with work promoting client-server computer networks. He also was involved with Microsoft's Encarta CD-ROM encyclopedias and early efforts to sell cars online. </p><p>\n  As a young Microsoft executive in the early 1990s, Mr. Tait hired Satya Nadella, now the company's chief executive. </p><p>\n  An early proponent of the theory that work should resemble play, Mr. Tait decorated his Cranium office with gumball machines and wind-up toys. Walls in the headquarters were painted lime green and sunflower yellow. Mr. Tait's title was grand poobah. His co-founder, Mr. Alexander, was chief noodler. Employees rang a giant gong when it was time to celebrate something. \"Richard was just like a little kid,\" Mr. Alexander said approvingly. </p><p>\n  Along with Ms. Paron and her daughter, Mr. Tait is survived by three children. </p><p>\n  Having won big on a goofy board game despite a lack of experience in that field, he urged entrepreneurs to be bold. \"My personal mantra,\" he said, \"is that Orville Wright did not have a pilot's license.\" </p><p></p>",
