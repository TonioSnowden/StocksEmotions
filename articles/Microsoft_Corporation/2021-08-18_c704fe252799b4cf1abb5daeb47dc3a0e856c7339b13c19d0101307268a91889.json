  "text": "<p>Surging stock market performance by oil companies and banks led the world's largest sovereign wealth fund to a strong performance in the second quarter.</p> <p>Norway's $1.4tn oil fund produced a return of 9.4 per cent in the three months to the end of June, propelled by a 13.7 per cent return from equities while its bond and renewable energy portfolios had negative returns. </p> <p>The fund, which four years ago proposed selling out of its oil and gas stocks for financial reasons, said its strongest-performing sector in the second quarter was the energy sector with a 19.5 per cent return as oil prices climbed.</p> <p>The financial sector, which like energy was hard hit in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, also performed strongly with banks posting the biggest gains with a 23 per cent positive return.</p> <p>Norway's oil fund is akin to a giant index fund, owning on average 1.4 per cent of every listed company in the world as well as a portfolio of bonds, property and renewable energy assets.</p> <p>It is increasingly emphasising its focus on responsible investment under chief executive Nicolai Tangen. The fund in January started to publish how it will vote at all annual shareholder meetings five days before the events.</p> <p>The oil fund said on Wednesday that in the second quarter technology groups Alphabet, Microsoft, and Facebook made the largest positive contributions to its return while drugmaker Daiichi Sankyo, utility Iberdrola and property group Vonovia were the biggest drags.</p> <p>The fund's fixed income portfolio had a negative return of 2 per cent in the first half while its property assets — which include prime real estate on properties such as Regent Street in London, Fifth Avenue in New York and Boulevard Haussmann in Paris — returned 4.6 per cent. Its fledgling renewable energy assets, comprising one wind farm in the Dutch North Sea, returned minus 1.9 per cent, entirely due to currency moves.</p> <p>Norway's political parties are gearing up for elections on September 13 in which the future of its oil and gas industry, whose revenues flow into the fund, and use of the fund itself are heavily debated. Several smaller parties on the leftwing, favoured to win the elections, propose stopping new exploration and gradually phasing out production.</p> <p>Current centre-right prime minister Erna Solberg told the Financial Times last month that any government she led would not speed up the decline of the oil industry. </p> <p>She also warned that the next government would have to curb its use of the oil fund after record amounts of money were taken from it during the pandemic. Norway's central bank governor has said that spending levels need to be reduced as inflows to the fund are likely to dry up in the coming years.</p><p>Source: Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent 2021 'Norway's oil fund propelled to 9% return by strong equity performance' FT.com 18 August.
