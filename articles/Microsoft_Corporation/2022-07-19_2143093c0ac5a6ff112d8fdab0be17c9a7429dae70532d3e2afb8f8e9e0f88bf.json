  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs warned yesterday that it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c0c341f-6a02-4996-9b6c-e927e69273ea\">slow hiring and may cut underperforming staff</a> even as the Wall Street group's traders helped it overcome a slump in dealmaking and report better than expected profits in the second quarter.</p> <p>With fears of a recession mounting, Goldman chief executive David Solomon warned of increasing uncertainty owing to high inflation, monetary policy tightening in the US and the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>“In my dialogue with CEOs operating big global businesses, they tell me that they continue to see persistent inflation in their supply chain,” Solomon said in a call with analysts.</p> <p>Finance chief Denis Coleman said the bank was “closely re-examining” all its “forward spending and investment plans”. This, he said, includes slowing the pace of hiring and potentially reintroducing the year-end performance review of its employee base, which it had largely halted during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The bank's second-quarter results beat forecasts but showed big falls in net income and revenue. Investment banks are suffering in particular from a dearth of equity underwriting activity, following a slew of initial public offerings and listings by special purpose acquisition companies last year.</p> <p>Goldman's trading division, however, benefited from heightened buying and selling during the recent market volatility.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper</strong> All staff at Goldman Sachs must suddenly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93c57154-970d-4466-a090-8e03e30cb1dd\">feel more vulnerable than entitled</a>, says the Lex column.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Do you work at Goldman Sachs or elsewhere on Wall Street?

Europe hit by record heatwave </strong>Temperatures <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5fc8f41e-c66d-44cd-9abe-803d1008feaa\">peaked at 37C</a> across much of London and the south-west of England yesterday and are predicted to break records today. In mainland Europe, at least five nations have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e52be5f-4091-4b38-8156-9e3e7f4e4bf3\">declared states of emergency</a> or issued red alerts as tens of thousands of people have been displaced by wildfires.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Related read:</strong> Our new email, Climate Graphic: Explained, digs into the trends shaping climate change.

Exclusive: SoftBank halts work on Arm's London IPO</strong> SoftBank has put on hold <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3913492f-ce8c-4df9-9d7f-7156daea326e\">plans for a London initial public offering</a> of Arm because of the political turmoil in the UK. The political upheaval could pave the way for SoftBank to pursue a more straightforward US listing, a course of action originally favoured by SoftBank's billionaire founder Masayoshi Son.</p> <p><strong>3. Ukraine faces big cuts to wheat harvest </strong>The country's farmers will plant <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/21065943-4b8c-4f22-a91a-806b5d571860\">up to two-thirds less wheat</a> this year if Russia's Black Sea blockade is not lifted, prolonging the global food crisis and pushing prices higher, agriculture minister Mykola Solskyi told the Financial Times.</p> <p><strong>4. Nancy Pelosi to visit Taiwan next month</strong> The House of Representatives Speaker is to visit Taiwan next month, according to people familiar with the situation, as Taipei <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09669099-1565-4723-86c9-84e0ca465825\">comes under mounting pressure from China</a>. The 82-year-old California lawmaker cancelled a previous visit in April after she caught Covid-19.</p> <p><strong>5. US chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci to step down </strong>Nicknamed “America's doctor”, Anthony Fauci <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/641643d5-4934-4649-a67f-04fb75979f8e\">has confirmed he will step down</a> from his role by January 2025, the end of Joe Biden's first term as president. The man who became the face of Washington's coronavirus pandemic response told the FT he plans to pursue “other professional pursuits”.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Related news </strong>The EU is close to agreeing with&#xa0;BioNTech/Pfizer to <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/f2765c69-9e82-4b64-9654-3f95f6c4b2ec\">delay jab deliveries into 2024</a> amid a glut of shots.</p></li> </ul> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Vote on chipmakers' bill </strong>Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate majority leader, may call a vote as soon as today on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a5c33e9-16bf-4436-a4b9-ea5c1eda18a9\">a long-awaited $52bn package</a> of support for US chipmakers to confront China's growing technological prowess.</p> <p><strong>Corporate earnings </strong>Investors will be focused on subscriber numbers when Netflix announces second-quarter results. Shares in the streaming service plunged in April when it reported a loss of subscribers for the first time in a decade. However, it recently announced a<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e83331a0-b351-4f88-93e3-fbf33d5c206e\"> partnership with Microsoft</a> on an ad-supported subscription tier, to attract price-conscious consumers. Other companies reporting today include Johnson &amp; Johnson, Lockheed Martin and Hasbro.</p> <p><strong>Economic data </strong>Economists expect the annualised pace of new home construction to rise to 1.58mn in June, after falling 14.4 per cent month on month in May to almost 1.55mn, well below the consensus forecast. Permits for building new homes are expected to decline due to a surge in mortgage rates.</p> <p><strong>Crypto conference</strong> FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Galaxy Digital chief Michael Novogratz are set to share their thoughts on the digital asset industry against the backdrop of bailouts and bankruptcies in the sector. Bankman-Fried and Novogratz will be among those scheduled to speak at <a href=\"https://events.bloomberglive.com/bloomberg-crypto-summit-new-york-2022/home\">a Bloomberg crypto summit in New York</a>. Ahead of the conference, bitcoin rose <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/20c8b5e7-e98a-494e-bcad-fc5dd2b35899#post-34860216-2cb3-41e4-8e6b-bd51927e8495\">back above $22,000</a> as fears of a more aggressive rate rise by the Federal Reserve than previously indicated faded. </p> <p><strong>Market outlook</strong> Elsewhere in the market, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8aff2875-8875-469e-ad12-3329ad33e289\">the euro rallied</a> ahead of what is expected to the first interest rate rise in the eurozone for more than a decade when the European Central Bank meets on Thursday. In equity markets, shares across Europe fell slightly. Futures trading, however, indicated shares on Wall Street would open higher after closing lower on Monday following news that Apple was reportedly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e43c455-e8d3-484f-afff-d7d6e8f6a8da\">considering cutting spending and slowing hiring</a> amid fears of a possible recession in the US.</p> <p><strong>Leadership race for the Conservative party </strong>The number of candidates in the contest to succeed Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0131f46-3f8b-4225-9602-5612b7d314a8\">is now down to four</a>, with another round of voting later today. Yesterday Tom Tugendhat, a former soldier who did not serve in the Johnson government, dropped out after losing in the latest round of voting. <em>Our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ed407bd-ac0d-4293-a0fe-c01dfa15d9d2\"><em>leadership election tracker</em></a><em> has the background on the remaining candidates.</em></p> <p><strong>Putin in Iran for trilateral talks with Turkey </strong>Vladimir Putin will meet Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Iran's Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran today. It is the Russian president's first trip outside of Russia since the invasion of Ukraine and there are hopes a deal will be agreed between Moscow and Ankara to unblock the export of millions of tons of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports.</p> <p><em>At 3pm BST (10am ET), the FT we will be hosting a Twitter space discussion on the @financialtimes Twitter account about SCOTUS's sudden lurching to the right and Justice Clarence Thomas.&#xa0;</em></p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Democrats lack the tools they need to fight inflation</strong> Joe Biden has made fighting inflation his number one priority. But, says economist Megan Greene, there is little a president or political party can do about rapidly rising prices. The most effective inflation-busting policy? <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63daf2fa-46fd-4b22-9a48-3781bc43a756\">Leave it to the Fed</a>. </p> <p><strong>Lagarde wrestles with an ‘impossible situation'</strong> The last time the ECB raised interest rates in 2011, it was forced into a reversal within months as the eurozone plunged into a wrenching debt crisis. <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/2d2faef3-e101-49fa-9d48-e07bae0beab7\">Fears of a similar outcome</a> are front of mind as Christine Lagarde prepares to announce the ECB's first rate rise in 11 years on Thursday to curb inflation.</p> <p><strong>Israeli attacks feed fear and distrust in Iran </strong>Israel has been blamed by Iran for the assassination of at least five nuclear scientists in the last 12 years; the most recent, in 2020, was a sophisticated operation involving a remote-controlled machine gun. The killings have stoked concerns that <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/d1dac425-36a1-4356-bec6-fb7d41ca82e4\">a shadow war could burst into the open</a>.</p> <p><strong>Young people are suffering a social recession </strong>Did Covid-19 improve our social capital by reminding us of our dependence on each other, driving acts of kindness and care? Or did it make it worse, leaving more people isolated and lonely? The answer depends on <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/de08f787-b2ee-4615-a493-fa53b7200c48\">who and where you were</a>, Sarah O'Connor writes.</p> <p><strong>Italy's hard-right parties ready to fill void </strong>Mario Draghi's offer last week to resign as prime minister <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/60bb1707-4b69-4718-bb0f-a34b482f2d68\">triggered enthusiasm on the far-right</a> for a snap election. A new rightwing coalition would have significant implications for Rome's stretched public finances and its approach to the war in Ukraine.</p> <h1>Travel</h1> <p>Set between ice cap and ocean in a village of just 50 people, the new Icefjord Centre in Ilulissat, on Greenland's west coast, offers 18-course menus.
