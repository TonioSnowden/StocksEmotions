  "title": "About The Wall Street Journal Economic Forecasting Survey",
  "text": "<p>The survey's frequency has changed over time. As of April 2021, we conduct it quarterly—in January, April, July and October—although we conduct brief surveys in between the quarterly installments as news warrants. From the mid-1980s through 2002, we conducted the survey twice a year. From 2003 through March 2021, its frequency was monthly.</p><p>What Kinds of Questions Does the Survey Ask?</p><p>We ask economists to forecast a range of economic indicators: quarterly and annual GDP, the Consumer Price Index, unemployment rate, monthly change in nonfarm payrolls, the midpoint of the range for the Federal Funds Rate, closing yield on 10-year Treasury Notes, and others. Some questions, such as GDP, have been asked throughout the life of the survey. Others, such as the exchange rate for Euros to U.S. dollars, were asked only for a time.</p><p>Each month, the survey includes questions related to current events. We also ask economists for comments for publication. Not every economist answers every question.</p><p>Who Are the Economists in the Survey?</p><p>The panel includes more than 70 academic, business and financial economists, and the makeup of the panel has evolved over time. The name and affiliation of each economist, as well as their latest indicator forecasts, is included in the Excel spreadsheet available with each survey.</p><p>Where Can I See Economists' Forecasts?</p><p>In the annual lists below, click the \"Data\" link to download that month's indicator forecasts in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.</p><p>How Can I Get More Information?</p><p>We're glad to hear from readers who have questions about The Wall Street Journal's Economic Forecasting Survey or from economists who produce forecasts and are interested in being part of our panel.
