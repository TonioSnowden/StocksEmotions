  "text": "<p>Mr. Hughes will report directly to BitMEX Chief Executive Alexander HÃ¶ptner.</p><p>The platform in August agreed to a $100 million settlement with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department, and with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</p><p>The agencies said that BitMEX had failed to maintain a compliant anti-money-laundering program, allowing U.S. customers to access the platform while failing to verify their identities.</p><p>BitMEX's efforts to put a more sure-footed compliance program in place come as it embarks on plans to scale up its business and expand globally.</p><p>\"The next stage in our evolution will be characterized by an expansion of the platform's capabilities, paired with an equally ambitious push into markets worldwide,\" Mr. Hughes said. He added that \"world-class risk management, compliance and regulatory-affairs programs\" would be key to the plan.</p><p>Before joining BitMEX, Mr. Hughes served as managing director of Coinbase's European business. He previously spent almost a decade at Morgan Stanley as an executive director in its compliance and legal division, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p><p>Write to Richard Vanderford at richard.vanderford@wsj.com</p><p>Crypto Platform BitMEX Taps New Risk Boss</p>",
