Take our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2022-01-21/\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb317124-0d59-4a9e-ab3b-06bff3484751\">yesterday rebuked Joe Biden</a> for suggesting that a “minor incursion” by Russian forces into his country might not prompt a severe allied response, forcing the US president to row back on his comments of a day earlier.</p> <p>“We want to remind the great powers that there are no minor incursions and small nations,” Zelensky <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1484171183264129025?s=20\">wrote on Twitter</a>.</p> <p>Biden sought to row back his comments from a day earlier, saying that any Russian incursion would spark sweeping sanctions.</p> <p>“If any, any assembled Russian units move across the Ukrainian border that is an invasion,” Biden said yesterday. “Let there be no doubt at all, if [Russian president Vladimir] Putin makes this choice, Russia will pay a heavy price.”</p> <p>The president's tough talk came as Antony Blinken, secretary of state, prepared to meet his counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Geneva for talks on how to de-escalate the crisis as Russia <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdd4c096-b534-4b8b-a546-36fac89f66e6\">sends more troops</a> to its border with Ukraine.</p> <p>Blinken sought to reassert western unity and remind Moscow of the serious consequences of any Ukraine invasion ahead of his meeting with Lavrov. </p> <p>“We've been very clear throughout that, if any Russian military forces move across the Ukrainian border and commit new acts of aggression, that would be met by a swift, severe, united response from the US and its allies and partners,” said Blinken yesterday after talks in Berlin with counterparts from Germany, France and the UK. </p> <p>Moscow <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c237a37b-eeca-45b1-99b2-746c9d10a059\">published its hardline demands</a> on the foreign ministry's website ahead of the meeting, including Nato removing all its forces from Bulgaria, Romania and other ex-communist states in eastern Europe that joined the alliance after 1997. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Putin has overplayed his hand on Ukraine, writes the former secretary of defense Robert Gates.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Top Stories Today is a regularly updated short-form audio digest of the day's top headlines, produced every weekday and read aloud by Microsoft Azure AI.
