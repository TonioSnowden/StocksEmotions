  "title": "Business News: Roblox Suffers Extended Outage Of Online Games",
  "text": "<p>In August, Roblox had more than 48 million users who spent four billion hours on it, according to internal metrics. The platform is particularly popular with preteens.</p><p>As of Sunday afternoon, some users said they were able to get back on the platform. Roblox tweeted: \"Quick update as we work to get things back to normal. We are incrementally bringing regions back online.\" The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday.</p><p>The outage began as the company kicked off a Halloween-theme event in partnership with Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. in which the restaurant chain pledged to give away more than $1 million in free burritos to Roblox users. Roblox on Friday tweeted that the outage \"was not related to any specific experiences or partnerships on the platform.\"</p><p>In an email Saturday, a Roblox spokesman told The Wall Street Journal there was \"no evidence of an external intrusion.\"</p><p>Eight-year old Julia Ocasio of Brooklyn said the outage put a damper on her weekend.</p><p>\"I was a little hurt by it because when I'm bored I usually play Roblox and it's fun,\" said the third-grader.</p><p>Her father, Ray Ocasio, a 50-year-old substance-abuse counselor, said the outage has been frustrating for him as a parent, too. \"You don't want your kid moping around,\" he said. But he added that he also saw an opportunity to teach Julia about keeping levelheaded. \"It's just a game. It's not something to get into a frenzy over,\" he said.</p><p>Many content creators were also affected, including aspiring YouTuber Hannah Rizk, who recently started creating and posting weekly videos about the Roblox role-playing game \"Adopt Me!\" on YouTube. The 14-year-old switched to playing Microsoft Corp.'s \"Minecraft\" and other games while waiting things out.</p><p>Hannah's mother, 44-year-old Sabrina Rizk, said she also missed playing games on Roblox with her daughter, what she described as a bonding experience. \"I'm finding I'm having withdrawal symptoms,\" said Ms. Rizk, a homemaker in a suburb of Austin, Texas, and an amateur investor who bought about $1,000 of shares in Roblox when the company went public in March.</p><p>Outages affecting large volumes of users are relatively common. Earlier in October, Facebook Inc.'s services went offline for as much as six hours. The company apologized for the incident, which affected its core platforms and apps including WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook Messenger.</p><p>A recently completed global survey by Uptime Institute LLC, a provider of consulting services on data-center reliability, found that 69% of data-center operators had some sort of outage in the past three years. Human error played a role in 78% of those incidents and 44% had major financial, reputational and other consequences.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
