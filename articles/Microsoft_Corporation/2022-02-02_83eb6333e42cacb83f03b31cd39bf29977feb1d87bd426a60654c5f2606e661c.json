  "text": "<p>The billionaire made the change official in late 2021&#xa0;following her divorce&#xa0;from&#xa0;Microsoft&#xa0;Corp. MSFT&#xa0;co-founder Bill Gates, the people said, when she published her first individual Giving Pledge letter. In 2010, the couple had committed in a joint Giving Pledge letter to give most of their fortune to the Gates Foundation.</p><p>“I recognize the absurdity of so much wealth being concentrated in the hands of one person, and I believe the only responsible thing to do with a fortune this size is give it away—as thoughtfully and impactfully as possible,” French Gates&#xa0;wrote in her new letter.</p><p>The Gates Foundation is one of the world's largest philanthropies with an endowment topping $50 billion. In July, Gates and French Gates said they&#xa0;would commit a further $15 billion&#xa0;to the endowment. It is possible that French Gates makes additional donations to the foundation even as she gives to other charities, one of the people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>What the stock split by Google's parent, Alphabet, means.</p><p>CNN President Jeff Zucker resigns, citing relationship with colleague.</p>",
