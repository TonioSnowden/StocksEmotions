  "text": "<p>A female Deutsche Bank trainee accused a male colleague of sexual assault and another of sexual harassment, triggering an investigation that led to the dismissal of one of the men.</p> <p>Germany's largest lender alerted criminal prosecutors to the allegations soon after they were made in February 2021. The bank's own probe did not substantiate the most serious allegations but found that both men had exchanged inappropriate text messages and photos with the woman. </p> <p>The more senior of the men, who was fired, had also improperly secured the trainee preferential treatment at work, according to documents seen by the Financial Times.</p> <p>Deutsche Bank's investigation and the subsequent dismissal come amid changing attitudes in a country that has been slow to embrace the MeToo movement, which started in the US four years ago.</p> <p>Thirteen per cent of female employees in Germany experience sexual harassment at work, according to a 2019 <a href=\"https://www.antidiskriminierungsstelle.de/SharedDocs/downloads/EN/publikationen/factsheet_en_Umgang_mit_sex_Belaestig_am_ArbPlatz_Schroettle_20191025.pdf;jsessionid=F0B6EA771BF4E0D927C547F30400CE25.intranet212?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2\">study</a> on behalf of the Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency.</p> <p>Julia Viohl, who specialises in German labour law at Berlin-based law firm Vangard, said there remained barriers to employers taking swift action in harassment cases.</p> <p>“Under German labour law, an employee who is harassing cannot be fired automatically,” she said, adding that only grave violations can be punished by immediate dismissal. Moreover, German courts sometimes ruled in favour of the accused harasser. “I can only shake my head about some recent rulings.” </p> <p>At Deutsche Bank, the investigation was launched after the female trainee disclosed the allegations in a lawsuit related to her own dismissal. The FT is not revealing the identities of those involved due to legal constraints.</p> <p>One of the men, who is still under investigation by Deutsche Bank and criminal prosecutors, had a romantic relationship with the trainee before she applied to join the bank.</p> <p>The woman alleged that he helped her get the job, including disclosing a case study used to assess candidates. She said that he mentally abused and threatened her and forced her into sex, including sadomasochism. Both the man and the woman took photos and videos of the interactions, some of which were submitted to court. </p> <p>This banker was temporarily suspended but has now returned to work, pending the outcome of a wider probe into his behaviour. He has denied all wrongdoing and said that all sexual encounters were consensual. He did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>A criminal probe against the more senior male employee was dropped after prosecutors concluded that there was insufficient evidence of criminality. However, Deutsche Bank fired him after an internal investigation found evidence of other misconduct, people familiar with the matter said.</p> <p>The criminal prosecutor and lawyers for the trainee and the fired employee declined to comment.</p> <p>The woman was in her late twenties when she started as a trainee at Deutsche Bank. She did not report to either of the accused employees. The more senior manager, who is significantly older than her, added the trainee as a contact on LinkedIn a few months after she had joined, and she then sent him an innocuous chat message, according to people familiar with the matter. </p> <p>The senior manager told Deutsche Bank that he added the woman to his LinkedIn contacts only after she was automatically suggested by the social network's algorithm. </p> <p>Days after an initial exchange of messages on LinkedIn, the senior manager arranged to have dinner with the trainee at an expensive restaurant. The dinner did not ultimately take place but a few months later both met for the first time over a coffee in a public space, and some months later at least once in the woman's apartment, which was paid for by Deutsche Bank.</p> <p>Eight months after their first contact, the senior manager and the woman started to discuss sexual preferences in messages. The senior employee then sent the woman explicit photos. On at least one occasion, the trainee had encouraged him to do so, according to chat messages. </p> <p>The senior manager confirmed the authenticity of the chats as well as the fact that he had urged the woman to delete the messages, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>Deutsche Bank's probe found evidence that the senior manager had illicitly interfered with the woman's training programme, according to people familiar with the matter. After the trainee expressed desire to spend time at a particular Deutsche Bank division, he forwarded an email to colleagues in the relevant business unit, asking if they were interested in hosting her. </p> <p>After a negative response, the senior employee turned to a colleague who worked in human resources. This person enabled the plan while pointing out that the posting was “unusual” and not part of the ordinary training schedule, documents seen by the FT show. </p> <p>The woman told Deutsche Bank that the senior employee had tried to kiss her against her will on two occasions. She also said that she felt pressured to have sex with him, which she refused, and later suspected he was responsible for her dismissal. </p> <p>The lender's probe did not find evidence that the senior manager was involved in the termination decision, and the court dismissed the woman's lawsuit over unfair dismissal and unfair treatment. </p> <p>The senior manager denied the kissing attempts and all other allegations of wrongdoing. He acknowledged during the probe that he had, on one occasion, insisted that a chat about her career take place in her apartment. </p> <p>The bank, whose executive board discussed the case, dismissed the senior employee over alleged tampering with internal processes and the sharing of inappropriate content with a junior employee. He is challenging his dismissal in court.</p> <p>A person familiar with the case told the FT that the bank believed that this employee had “crossed a line” and displayed a serious “lack of judgment”.</p> <p>The human resources employee involved in arranging the trainee's unusual internal move was also reprimanded by Deutsche Bank. </p> <p>“Where necessary and appropriate, we have taken action and will continue to do so in the future,” the bank told the FT, adding that it promoted a “speak-up culture to encourage any employee experiencing discrimination, harassment, or unfair treatment to report any such experiences”.&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt 2021 'Deutsche Bank fired senior manager over explicit messages and photos' FT.com 20 December.
