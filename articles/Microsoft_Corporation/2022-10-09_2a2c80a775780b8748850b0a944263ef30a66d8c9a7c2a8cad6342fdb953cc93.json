  "text": "<p>As new technology drives an evolution in business needs, it is less likely you can get by in today's job market with the skill set you established 10 or 15 years ago.</p> <p>The World Economic Forum has suggested that 1bn people need to be <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/reskilling-revolution-jobs-future-skills/\">trained</a> in new and evolving skills by 2030. The types of professional skills for which the WEF forecasts high demand include not only specialised technical abilities for working with new technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing, but also the soft skills necessary for collaboration and interacting with others, like team building and developing strong company culture.</p> <p>Recent data from LinkedIn shows how quickly the ground is shifting. According to the professional networking platform, skill sets for jobs have already changed by 25 per cent since 2015. This is expected to double by 2027. As a result, some hiring practices have started to place more emphasis on skills: the number of recruiters who are using LinkedIn skills data to fill positions is up 20 per cent compared with last year — with those who follow this method more successful at getting hired.</p> <p>However, many companies are still missing out. According to a Harvard Business School study, 80 per cent of business leaders said their applicant-tracking systems were<a href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/managing-the-future-of-work/Documents/research/hiddenworkers09032021.pdf\"> filtering out half</a> of high-skilled, qualified candidates because of system parameters such as gaps in work history or missing credentials. </p> <p>In its present form, “the job market works a lot better if you went to the right school and had a certain job title from a brand name company”, says Rohan Rajiv, a product manager at LinkedIn. “But the challenge is, what if you didn't?”</p> <p>In an effort to create more equitable outcomes, Rajiv and his team build product features for the professional networking platform, such as tools that help companies search for candidates based on skills and to explicitly list skills in job postings, as well as allowing jobseekers to clearly compare how their own skills match up to a position's requirements.</p> <p>Prioritising competency over, say, a CV studded with glossy companies and a degree-level education, could help to ease a tight labour market. This type of skills-first hiring approach would de-emphasise details such as educational degree, years of experience and previous job titles, and instead focus on the candidate's ability to demonstrate that their professional skills map well to the requirements of the job for which they're applying.</p> <p>Loosening degree requirements is especially important for the many workers who skip traditional higher education altogether. A recent report published by Opportunity at Work, which helps people without degrees to find jobs, said there were more than<a href=\"https://opportunityatwork.org/our-solutions/stars-insights/blackstars/#form\"> 70mn American workers</a>, many of whom are people of colour, who have developed skills without obtaining bachelors degrees at all. </p> <p>A skills-based approach could help companies to better assess candidates' potential, because “potential trumps all”, says Jill Chapman, a senior performance consultant who specialises in recruitment and onboarding. “In today's hiring economy, an employer who hires for potential commits to taking on candidates who may not have the past experiences or preferred education when they start, but do possess the traits that make them a fit for the organisation now and successful in the future.” </p> <p>While the onus is on employers to assess potential and provide for it, today's workers also need to actively continue to develop skills to stay relevant. Growing up in the 1990s, education was king. Get a bachelors, my mother said — and then ideally a masters and a PhD — and it would unlock a bountiful career with untold earning potential. It is still true that degrees translate to higher<a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/research-summaries/education-earnings.html\"> lifetime earnings</a>, but it is not enough.</p> <p>Even if you are not changing jobs, Rajiv advises that you can keep up with your industry by browsing job listings and taking note of what skills are listed in the description. Use this to identify gaps in your CV, and address it by seeking out credentials, conferences, online courses or other educational or networking opportunities, he says.</p> <p>According to LinkedIn's <a href=\"https://linkedin.github.io/future-of-skills/\">Future of Skills report</a>, expertise in diversity, equity and inclusion, and cryptocurrencies are some of the most talked about skills, and for which demand has grown. Facebook, meanwhile, is out; the failure of its drive to “pivot to video”, among <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b9b6a30-d90a-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8\">other controversies since 2015</a>, have rendered it less dependable, and therefore a less powerful tool for social media marketing strategies.</p> <p>Another trend noted in the report is that the definitions of types of skills are more specific compared with 2015. People are more likely to list a particular software as a skill, for example, or specify “portrait photography” rather than just “photography”. This specification is a good practice, says Rajiv. </p> <p>“Ten years ago you could just say ‘photography' and you'd be fine, but today, [a recruiter might] type in ‘photography' and get a bunch of options.” By using more sophisticated language around skills, workers are better able to stand out for opportunities that are the best fit for them.</p> <p>It is too early in the great reshuffle to tell, but we may be moving towards a more fluid market where workers leverage their specific skill sets, rather than focusing on a linear path of increasingly senior job titles. This would mean employers adjusting their recruitment and career progression mindsets and being much more open to assessing transferable skills so that workers can change direction and try new things. </p> <p>Chandra Turner is one career coach who is already advising clients on how to change careers by successfully marketing the skills they have gained in the media industry. In Chandra's experience, hiring managers are already “very open” to people pivoting, particularly when hiring for newer industries such as brand publishing or affiliate marketing, because not enough people have backgrounds and expertise in those specific areas yet.</p> <p>The job market of tomorrow might be one that's less fussy about “career changes”, “pivots” and unconventional CVs, in which workers more freely assess their next moves based on where their skills are most needed — and most highly compensated.</p> <p>Chandra admits that having recognisable companies or educational institutions on one's CV is still helpful, but it's no longer the only route to success. “Our eye is drawn to things we know and recognise [on someone's CV],” she says, “but we have a cracking job market, and there's still room for you.”</p> <p>It's not just possible, but necessary. “Some of my older clients find it exhausting to be constantly changing and growing,” says Chandra. “But we have to be flexible. When you start feeling stable, that's when you should start getting nervous, because you're not changing — and everyone else is.”</p><p>Source: Sophia Smith 2022 'Why skills are more important than ever' FT.com 9 October.
