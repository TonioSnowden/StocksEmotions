  "title": "Technology:  Microsoft  CEO Vows  To Increase  Salaries  ----  By Aaron Tilley",
  "text": "<p>   Microsoft Corp.'s chief executive is promising to boost employee compensation amid continued low unemployment across the U.S. and high inflation. </p><p>   Satya Nadella told Microsoft employees Monday that the software maker plans to nearly double its global budget for merit-based salary raises, a person familiar with the announcement said. Mr. Nadella also said the company would increase annual stock compensation at least 25%, the person said. </p><p>   Microsoft's readiness to spend more on staff follows similar moves by rivals in its core cloud-computing sector. Late last year, Alphabet Inc.'s Google announced a new cash bonus plan that lets employees receive bonuses of nearly any size for nearly any reason. In February, Amazon.com Inc. said it would double its cash-pay cap for employees. </p><p>   Microsoft has also seen competition for talent elsewhere. Its augmented reality HoloLens team has experienced a large number of employees being poached by Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. </p><p>   For employees with experience building augmented-reality hardware, Meta was willing to double salary for some Microsoft employees, people familiar with the situation said. </p><p>   More recently, some companies in tech have signaled they were becoming more thrifty. Meta and Twitter Inc., have both said they were pulling back on staff additions and spending. </p><p>   \"This increased investment in our worldwide compensation reflects the ongoing commitment we have to providing a highly competitive experience for our employees,\" a Microsoft spokeswoman said. </p><p></p>",
