  "title": "Nestlé to Stop Selling Pet Food, Coffee and KitKat in Russia; Nescafe owner to suspend production and sales of most products in the country after facing growing pressure from politicians and employees",
  "text": "<p>Nestlé said the only products it would continue to sell in Russia would be baby food and other infant-nutrition items, specialist veterinary meals and medical-nutrition products.</p><p>While Nestlé previously suspended imports and exports of products it deemed nonessential, such as Nespresso pods and San Pellegrino water, the company has kept all six of its Russian factories open to produce goods for local sale, including confectionery and coffee. About 90% of what Nestlé sells in Russia is made there. It previously described its products as essential, saying it had a responsibility to its employees in the country.</p><p>Wednesday's announcement means Nestlé will suspend the \"vast majority of our prewar volume\" in Russia, according to a spokesman. \"We are in the process of identifying solutions for our people and our factories in Russia,\" he said. \"We will continue to pay our people.\" The company has about 7,000 workers in Russia.</p><p>While many of the world's largest makers of household staples, including Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Dove soap maker Unilever PLC, are continuing to sell food and other consumer products in Russia, Nestlé has attracted particular scrutiny.</p><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mentioned Nestlé by namein several speeches calling for Western businesses to pull out of Russia.</p><p>\"'Good food. Good life.' This is the slogan of Nestlé, your company that refuses to leave Russia,\" Mr. Zelensky said in a Saturday audiolink address to people attending an antiwar protest in Bern, Switzerland.</p><p>Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has also criticized the company, tweeting last week that he had talked with Nestlé Chief Executive Mark Schneider, who he said showed no understanding of the side effect of continuing to sell in Russia.</p><p>Several of Nestlé's Ukraine-based employees—it has about 5,000—have also voiced dissatisfaction on social media with the company's response to the invasion.</p><p>Late last week, Nestlé's Europe head, Marco Settembri, drew some employees' ire during an internal webcast for staff in the region when he said the company's Ukrainian workers should be united with their Russian colleagues, according to participants.</p><p>\"At this point, I would say this is a crazy thing to say,\" said Sofia Vashchenko, who oversees a team working on web content for Nestlé in Ukraine. \"People really, really started getting mad,\" she said. Ms. Vashchenko said separately in a LinkedIn post that her team was \"mentally broken\" after the webcast.</p><p>A spokesman for Nestlé said that Mr. Settembri had told colleagues across Europe on the webcast, \"Let's try to stay united against the nonsense of war.\"</p><p>Russia has been an attractive market for Nestlé. Last month, the company credited strong demand in the country for helping its Europe, Middle East and North Africa region log its highest sales growth in a decade.</p><p>Overall, Russia generates about 2% of Nestlé global sales, and the company has announced investments in the past year to bolster its pet food and confectionery operations in the country.</p><p>Ukraine, meanwhile, has an outsize importance for Nestlé because it is home to a hub supporting several key global business functions. The company's business-service center in Lviv employs about 1,800 workers handling accounting, IT support, supply support, administration, payroll and other tasks for Nestlé offices in more than 70 countries around the world.</p><p>After the regional webcast, some employees usually based in Lviv said their team leads had written to Nestlé's top management calling on the company to suspend operations in Russia. The Nestlé spokesman declined to comment on the letter.</p><p>Ukrainian workers have also discussed going on strike if Nestlé continues to sell products in Russia, some employees said.</p><p>\"Saying 'we condemn it' isn't a lot,\" said Osee Petyo, a Lviv-based Nestlé worker who has since fled to Paris. \"They have to do things to affect the financial position of Russia.\"</p><p>Write to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com</p><p>Nestlé to Stop Selling Pet Food, Coffee and KitKat in Russia</p>",
