  "title": "Judge Approves $18 Million Activision Settlement With EEOC; Ruling had faced opposition from a state department that is suing the videogame company",
  "text": "<p>But the company and the federal agency became locked in a monthslong legal battle with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing after the state agency sought to block the settlement, saying it could ruin the department's lawsuit against Activision. A DFEH spokeswoman said the agency \"will continue to vigorously prosecute its action against Activision in California state court.\"</p><p>California District Judge Dale S. Fischer late Tuesday ruled against the DFEH, saying any approved claimants must waive their right to recover any sexual harassment, pregnancy discrimination or related retaliation stemming from the agency's case against Activision.</p><p>A spokeswoman for the California agency didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In addition to the $18 million fund to compensate eligible claimants, Activision has agreed to engage a neutral, third-party equal employment opportunity consultant—a nonemployee who must be approved by the EEOC—who will oversee Activision's compliance with its agreement, among other resolutions.</p><p>Santa Monica, Calif.-based Activision, known for its \"Call of Duty,\" \"World of Warcraft\" and \"Candy Crush\" franchises, has around 10,000 employees, and it posted close to $9 billion in revenue for 2021.</p><p>\"Our goal is to make Activision Blizzard a model for the industry, and we will continue to focus on eliminating harassment and discrimination from our workplace,\" Activision Chief Executive Bobby Kotick said Tuesday ahead of the ruling.</p><p>During a news conference held over Zoom on Wednesday morning, EEOC acting district director Christine Park-Gonzalez said the Activision settlement is one of the largest harassment settlements the agency has reached. \"It is our sincere hope that this resolution will result in meaningful change across the videogame industry,\" she said.</p><p>The DFEH's case against Activision was filed in July and alleges that the company ignored numerous complaints by female employees of harassment, discrimination and retaliation.</p><p>Activision has said the lawsuit includes distorted, and in many cases, false descriptions of its past, and that it strives to pay all employees fairly.</p><p>Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating Activision over its handling of employees' allegations of sexual misconduct and workplace discrimination, The Wall Street Journal reported in September. The federal agency subpoenaed Activision and several of its senior executives, including Mr. Kotick. A spokeswoman for the company has said it is cooperating with the SEC.</p><p>Microsoft Corp. in January agreed to buy Activision in an all-cash deal valued at about $75 billion. Microsoft's videogame boss Phil Spencer has said he is confident that Activision management is addressing workplace issues. The proposed acquisition is being reviewed by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the Journal reported in February. The companies have targeted 2023 for closing the transaction.</p><p>Activision shares slipped 0.5% to $80.36 on Wednesday.</p><p>Write to Sarah E.
