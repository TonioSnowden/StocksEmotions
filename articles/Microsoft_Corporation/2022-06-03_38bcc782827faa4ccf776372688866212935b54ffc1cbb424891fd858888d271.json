  "text": "<p>One of the most striking pictures in Jonathan Kanter's office is a cartoon of a wrecked airship called “High Finance”, featuring business magnates of early 1900s America as stranded passengers.</p> <p>The doomed aircraft's splintered blades bear the names of large trusts and a broken-up corporation, while hovering above it is the apparent cause of the crash: a black cloud labelled “investigation”, “merger decision” and “law”.</p> <p>The image was made in 1904, at the height of the trustbusting era pioneered by then president Theodore Roosevelt. But if Kanter, head of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/0b4d86eb-1706-46e0-9e00-47c144c9f9a7\">US Justice Department</a>'s antitrust unit, has his way, cartoonists might be inspired to draw similar scenes more than 100 years later.</p> <p>“We're seeing that once-in-a-century inflection point in terms of reach of corporate power and popular support for addressing corporate power,” Kanter, 48, told the Financial Times in an interview. “And we're seeing a once-in-many-generation[s] shift in how markets function, and the need to update and adapt our antitrust enforcement to address new market realities.”</p> <p>Kanter, who joined the DoJ in November, is among several top antitrust officials appointed by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/topics/people/Joe_Biden\">Joe Biden</a> as the US president seeks to crack down on anti-competitive conduct.</p> <p>This new progressive generation — which includes Lina Khan, chair of the US Federal Trade Commission, and Tim Wu, White House adviser on competition policy — argues that insufficient enforcement in the past few decades and an excessive focus on consumer benefits have allowed a small number of companies to dominate vast chunks of the American economy.</p> <p>Michael Carrier, law professor at Rutgers University, said the advent of this new cohort marked a “remarkable moment”. “If they are successful, that will lead to a sea change in antitrust,” he added.</p> <p>As America's top antitrust enforcer, Kanter is in one of the most powerful positions to shape US competition policy. He is also less constrained than Khan at the FTC, where her key decisions are put to a vote by its commissioners.</p> <p>Kanter, who is more hawkish than many of his predecessors at the DoJ, argues that under-enforcement in the past has “allowed the law to calcify around bad precedents”.</p> <p>“The most significant cases in antitrust history were courageous at the time, they were bold, they were big. If we don't go to court, then we're regulators, not enforcers,” he added.</p> <p>“He's not just your standard bureaucrat . . . He's not afraid to lose, and that's very unusual among enforcers,” said Matt Stoller, director of research at the progressive American Economic Liberties Project.</p> <p>The department's record in court under Kanter has so far been mixed, securing some guilty pleas and convictions but also suffering a pair of notable defeats in cases where it brought criminal charges against executives for anti-competitive conduct in the labour market.</p> <p>Commenting on these cases, Kanter told a University of Chicago conference in April that they had survived motions to dismiss, showing courts deemed them “legally sound”. He added: “I'm here to declare that we're not part of the chickenshit club,” quoting the title of the Jesse Eisinger book on the DoJ's failure to prosecute business executives.</p> <p>Kanter said he had also urged DoJ staff to “pump up” Tom Petty's song “I Won't Back Down<em>”</em> and “dance like nobody's watching”.</p> <p>Despite this resolve, Kanter still has his work cut out. The kind of landmark antitrust lawsuits that could shape case law and that Kanter believes are overdue have yet to materialise, with experts arguing such complex cases require time to pull together.</p> <p>But the DoJ has pushed ahead on other fronts. It has sued to block an acquisition in the sugar industry and a $13bn healthcare tie-up involving industry giant UnitedHealth Group. Two mergers in shipping equipment and building materials were abandoned after the DoJ took action. </p> <p>Jointly with the FTC, the DoJ is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8893550-fc6c-4301-879d-209aa9323f5b\">overhauling merger guidelines</a> and has launched forums involving individuals affected by corporate tie-ups. “If we're having a conversation inside the beltway here in Washington with ourselves . . . then we are missing the boat and we are not serving our client, the United States public,” said Kanter.</p> <p>Born in Queens, New York, to elementary schoolteachers, Kanter has dedicated his legal career to antitrust, starting with internships at the FTC in the 1990s before rising through the ranks of private practice and most recently launching a law firm that only represented clients seeking antitrust enforcement.</p> <p>Andrew Finch, co-chair of the antitrust unit at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison and Kanter's former colleague, said: “One thing that stands out about Jonathan is his enthusiasm for antitrust enforcement”, and his being “relentlessly inquisitive . . . He never stops.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Before joining the DoJ, Kanter made his name on high-profile Big Tech cases including representing Microsoft, Yelp and other companies against Google.</p> <p>Widely perceived as a Big Tech critic, Kanter counts the industry among his key focuses. “Technology is really the new factory, the new oil, foundational to our economy,” he said. “We have to make sure that the law and our enforcement programme is calibrated to its realities.”</p> <p>Last year, Google — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8b2def2-0cb0-4a2d-941d-b965f6037dbb\">which the DoJ sued</a> in 2020 over allegedly suppressing competition in internet search — raised concerns with the department over Kanter's impartiality and called for an investigation into whether he should be recused from litigation and investigations against the company.</p> <p>Last month, Bloomberg reported that Kanter had been barred from probes involving Google while the DoJ weighs his recusal over concerns relating to his past work for rivals of the search giant.</p> <p>In a letter to the DoJ, progressive antitrust organisations said they were “alarmed” by this development and argued Kanter should cover Google as he had no conflicts of interest. Laurence Tribe, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School, wrote in an article that Google's claims were at odds with the DoJ's ethics rules as Kanter is not “switching sides” from defending the company to litigating against it.</p> <p>Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts, wrote on Twitter that Biden had picked Kanter “precisely because of his experience enforcing antitrust law” and that the DoJ “must reject Google's attempts to bully law enforcement. No company is above the law.”</p> <p>The DoJ and Google declined to comment.</p> <p>The US Senate confirmed Kanter with a widely bipartisan vote of 68-29. But his tough enforcement stance has ruffled feathers in Big Tech and the antitrust establishment. Last month, Kanter warned the FT of an impending <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f4cc882-1444-4ea3-8a31-c382364aace1\">crackdown on the private equity industry</a>; later that week, former US Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers wrote on Twitter to express concern over what he called a new era of “populist antitrust policy”. </p> <p>Yet a spin around Kanter's office suggests how he might respond to such pushback. An image of Mickey Mouse with a wide smile and a raised middle finger hangs on the way to Kanter's desk, where he keeps a compass that he has also given as a gift to staff.</p> <p>It is “a reminder that we have a mission . . . to zealously represent the American people”, Kanter said. “It's sometimes easy to forget that when you're in the thick of things, when you're in battle with companies, when people are making personal attacks. But it's important not to get distracted, because we're here for a reason.”</p><p>Source: Stefania Palma in Washington 2022 'A ‘once-in-a-century inflection point': DoJ's antitrust chief on curbing corporate power' FT.com 3 June.
