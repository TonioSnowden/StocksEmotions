  "text": "<p>Hourly shift workers in grocery stores and other retailers, nurses and hotel employees are among those who use the Montreal-based company's smartphone-based system to manage schedules, engage in training sessions and communicate with colleagues and managers, according to the company's website.</p><p>\"We're solving problems right now that are shared globally,\" Mr. Kramer said about WorkJam's products, which let employers provide an increasingly expected technology-based relationship that is more flexible for workers.</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated some workplace trends as well as the expectations of workers, such as an increasing emphasis on digital communications, Mr. Kramer said.</p><p>The eight-year-old company's technology integrates with existing back-office workforce management systems, such as those from Workday Inc., Salesforce Inc. and Microsoft Corp. WorkJam customers include retailers American Eagle Outfitters Inc. and Target Corp., food-services company Aramark and healthcare provider DaVita Inc.</p><p>\"WorkJam is also able to provide productivity tools to the field [operations] so that they're able to run better and become more efficient,\" Mr. Kramer said. Workers can also use the app to complete training courses to open up additional opportunities in WorkJam's open shift marketplace.</p><p>WorkJam can use or translate more than 150 languages, helping create a more inclusive work environment by bridging language barriers, Mr. Kramer said.</p><p>A focus area for enhancing its products includes adding app components that are practical and improve the ability of workers to manage everyday needs such as paying bills and obtaining insurance as well as offering discounts through loyalty-and-rewards programs, according to Demopolis Managing Partner Timothy Greenfield.</p><p>One WorkJam app component gives workers a way to get an advance on their pay while another lets them pick up extra shifts in different locations. So, for example, a university student could arrange to work shifts at a location near home during academic breaks, Mr. Kramer said.</p><p>The ability to schedule shifts in different places and get pay advances can also be important for workers dealing with unexpected circumstances, Mr. Greenfield said. \"It can, maybe, even be life-changing…where the car broke down, the refrigerator broke down, and you wonder how you're going to make it.\"</p><p>The Demopolis executive said he has personal experience with the issues that can arise from hourly work and scheduling. A pizza shop provided him with his first job and his wife owns a wine bar, which like many other small businesses in recent years has struggled with staffing and scheduling.</p><p>\"We lived firsthand, as a family, what a no-call, no-show meant,\" Mr. Greenfield said. \"We understand intimately the challenge both from a business perspective and also from a personal perspective.\"</p><p>Write to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com</p>",
