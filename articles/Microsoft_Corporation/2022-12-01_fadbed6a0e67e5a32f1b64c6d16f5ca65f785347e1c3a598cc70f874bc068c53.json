  "title": "A Microsoft Leader's COP27 Takeaway: It's Time for Companies to Get Things Done; Plentiful renewable energy could attract global manufacturers, says Microsoft President Brad Smith",
  "text": "<p>\"I think businesses need to show up and roll up their sleeves and do more,\" he said.</p><p>Like its fellow cloud-computing giants, Microsoft is grappling with the environmental impact of its products, services and data centers across the globe, especially in drought-prone regions. Microsoft has promised that by 2030 it will capture more greenhouse-gas emissions than it emits and replenish more water than it consumes.</p><p>WSJ Pro Sustainable Business spoke to Mr. Smith following COP27. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p>WSJ Pro: What were your takeaways from COP27?</p><p>Mr. Smith: There were so many more people in Glasgow [at COP26] than in Sharm El Sheikh. I think that was in part because Glasgow was the first COP after Covid. I thought some of the European companies were present but not with senior leadership, not with as many senior leaders as a year ago. The American corporate presence at COP was smaller than a year ago. My guess is that some of that may turn around as we get to the United Arab Emirates next year [for COP28].</p><p>This year's theme was very aptâ€”implementation together. From a business perspective, implementation is just a fancy word for getting things done. Once you get to implementation, you get to a space where there is a greater opportunity, and perhaps even need, for business to step forward.</p><p>WSJ Pro: What has been the impact of the war in Ukraine?</p><p>Mr. Smith: The war in Ukraine has had two very important impacts on climate issues. First, in the short run, it is obviously pushing governments and countries to diversify their energy sources basically out of necessity and going as quickly as they can to wherever they can find it. Second, I think it makes the short-term climate goals in, say, 2022 and 2023 more difficult to achieve</p><p>But attending COP this year was a bit like watching the rewiring of the European economy in front of us. [The Ukraine war] is clearly accelerating Europe's track to renewables, wind and solar, and driving broader consideration for nuclear and perhaps most interestingly this focus on green hydrogen.</p><p>When you really get down to it, though, implementation has to advance in a series of coordinated efforts that are typically bringing certain groups and companies together or focused on specific issues. And then the rubber meets the ground inside each business.</p><p>WSJ Pro: How do you expect businesses to be involved going forward?</p><p>Mr. Smith: Businesses are under more pressure. In reality, with more than 3,900 companies having made climate pledges, the spotlight is on to assess whether people perform and fulfill the pledges they've made. There's economic headwinds in the way. But we're obviously determined to press forward despite the economy. And I think a lot of companies, but perhaps not all of them, feel they need to do so.</p><p>WSJ Pro: Should companies be brought more into the COP negotiation process?</p><p>Mr. Smith: I don't know if they should be brought more into the negotiation process, but they need to be involved in the implementation process. We need to think of this as a three-legged stool.</p><p>One leg is governments. The governments set the laws, they negotiate the international agreements, they put capital in place.</p><p>The second leg is the private sector, it is business. Businesses need to implement the pledges they are making, and I think businesses have a special role to play in innovation. When you look at the new technologies that are needed, there is no way to solve the climate crisis without more, faster innovation technologically. In that area in particular the business community is critical.</p><p>The third leg of the stool is the nonprofit or NGO community. Especially when it comes to taking the innovations that business creates and incubating new solutions, that is where NGOs are the best placed. And when they find something that works, government can put money behind it to help it scale.</p><p>I think we really do need more conversations that bring all three groups together, but we need to recognize that we have different roles to play.</p><p>WSJ Pro: How should business move to tackle global warming in the coming years?</p><p>Mr. Smith: We will need to work together because ultimately we will find, as we get farther into this, that a company cannot reduce its Scope 3 [supply-chain] emissions until entire countries move, especially around renewable energy and the modernization of their electrical grid. I think you will see by 2025, 2026 conversations about manufacturers and whether they should stay where they are or should they move to a different location. There will be an incredibly powerful need for manufacturers to expand manufacturing in locations that have renewable energy.</p><p>You could also then see this process emerge where you'll have companies go to a government and say, 'Hey, we'll work to persuade more manufacturers to move to your country if you'll invest in the policies that will modernize your grid and bring in green energy.' And you'll see manufacturers then say, 'We'll do the same.'</p><p>If you look back 10 or 20 or 50 years, you would see companies locate where there are tax benefits, that is often the narrative around Ireland, or they would locate in places where there was cheaper labor and obviously that's been a huge factor over the last 30 years. But I think if you look over the next 30 years, companies are going to locate manufacturing where there is green energy.</p><p>WSJ Pro: Have there been any significant business collaborations during the past year?</p><p>Mr. Smith: The First Movers Coalition really stands out as one of the important accomplishments over the last 12 months. Microsoft did not join in Glasgow last year, I think that was a mistake. As I tend to joke, we were among the second joiners of the first movers.</p><p>It's just extraordinary in my view to see the continuing diversification of efforts, the large companies that are making real and very important practical commitments. So much of the challenge is on Scope 3. We just have to find our way and innovate our way to greener cement, greener steel, among other things, and just seeing that added to the charge was really important.</p><p>I came away [from COP27] with a continuing concern for short-term prospects for progress but more optimism about efforts in the medium and long terms and certainly very impressed by First Movers and other similar efforts.</p><p>WSJ Pro: Why is it important for Microsoft to be part of this coalition?</p><p>Mr. Smith: We stimulate the technology innovation as an investor and we help stimulate the interest of others in investing by being a purchaser and showing that there is a real market that will emerge there. That's what we started a year, year and a half ago.</p><p>And then you look at our commitment in the First Movers Coalition, spending $200 million on this long-duration carbon removal, and then it starts to bring others together. When we bring others together, it shows there is a real market and gives us an opportunity to start to get the wheels turning.</p><p>WSJ Pro: What are the key collaborations going on?</p><p>Mr. Smith: Ninety-six percent to 97% of Microsoft's carbon emissions are Scope 3 emissions. But what you quickly find is that we all tend to have the same suppliers. So this isn't going to work if the suppliers are inundated with confusing, competing or conflicting reporting requirements, for example. It really does serve the world well and our individual companies well if we can standardize some aspects of this.</p><p>That's why we are so focused on standardizing carbon accounting and standardizing the kinds of reports that suppliers should make. And if we get standardized reports we'll also start to open the door, I think, to more accurate and transparent reports and reports that won't fall prey to fraudulent temptations.</p><p>Write to Dieter Holger at dieter.holger@wsj.com</p><p>A Microsoft Leader's COP27 Takeaway: It's Time for Companies to Get Things Done</p>",
