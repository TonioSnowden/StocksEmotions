  "text": "<p>Consignments are coming in thick and fast for New York's auction season in November. The latest collection to hit the block comes from the late David Solinger, a media and art lawyer who was president of the board of New York's Whitney Museum and who died in 1996. Solinger's fascination with art began when he studied painting in the 1940s, turning him into an avid collector who mixed with some of the 20th century's big-name artists. Those he came to represent professionally included Hans Hofmann, Louise Nevelson and Robert Motherwell.</p> <p>Sotheby's will offer about 90 of Solinger's works, valued at more than $100mn, with the highest priced works earmarked for a dedicated sale on November 14. These include Willem de Kooning's “Collage” (1950), with the top estimate of $18mn-$25mn, and Pablo Picasso's “Femme dans un fauteuil” (1927, est $15mn-$20mn).</p> <p>Solinger bought most of his art from galleries between 1951 and 1955, notes Oliver Barker, chair of Sotheby's Europe, and the shadow of the second world war looms over the collection. The Picasso was deposited by the artist at New York's MoMA for safekeeping during the war, while another work — Joan Miró's “Femme, étoiles” (est $15mn-$20mn) — was painted on May 7 1945, the day of Germany's surrender.</p> <p>Unusually these days, the works are neither guaranteed to sell nor offered for charity, although Solinger “was an incredible philanthropist during his life”, Barker says.</p>  <p>Christie's is not holding back on the superlatives for its guaranteed, charitable auction of the “collection of incomparable magnitude” from Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who died in 2018. It is certainly a highly prized consignment and, with Christie's predicting “an unprecedented $1bn sale” across November 9 and 10, it's a good idea to keep momentum high. </p> <p>More details of the “500 years of groundbreaking art” were revealed last week, including three works estimated at more than $100mn — by Georges Seurat, Paul Cézanne and Vincent van Gogh. The earliest work announced so far is Jan Brueghel the Younger's complete 17th-century “The Five Senses” (est $4mn-$6mn) and the latest confirmed work is Francis Bacon's triptych “Three Studies for Self-Portrait” (1979, low estimate $25mn). A Christie's Instagram reel features other goodies — including a more recent painting by David Hockney and works by Kandinsky and Brice Marden — though the auction house has yet to offer more information on these.</p>  <p>This week marks the opening of 125 Newbury Street in New York, the pet project of Arne Glimcher, founder of Pace. The gallery is on the corner of Broadway and Walker Street in Tribeca but is named after the original location of Pace, which Glimcher opened in Boston back in 1960. He remains chair of Pace, now run by his son <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5acbc373-4309-439d-9cee-d5c21e96b78f\">Marc Glimcher</a>, and the businesses share other staff members. “We're a family, both reliant and independent. Pace is Marc's; I own 125 Newbury,” Glimcher says.</p> <p>He describes his gallery as “a very selfish dream” born of needing “a rejuvenating episode to feel relevant”. His dream includes longer-running exhibitions that reflect his taste, luxuries that a global gallery such as Pace cannot always indulge. “I visit a lot of shows, but there are so many that I plan to see and by the time I get around to them they have closed,” he says — a familiar feeling to many in the market.</p> <p>His opening show, <em>Wild Strawberries</em>, where some of the works are for sale, uses the title of a 1957 film by Ingmar Bergman — its opening sequence has a figure that melts into the pavement — to explore works by 17 artists that explore “surreal transformations”. These include artists who came to fame when Glimcher started out in the 1960s — Paul Thek, Lucas Samaras and Lee Bontecou — and stretch to contemporary works by the likes of Julie Curtiss, Kathleen Ryan and Brandon Ndife (September 30-November 19).</p>  <p>The UK dealer Robert Newland, who had worked in businesses including Christie's, White Cube, Hauser &amp; Wirth and, most recently, Superblue, has pleaded guilty in a US district court to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, in connection with the $86mn scheme of Inigo Philbrick, who was sentenced to seven years in prison earlier this year.</p> <p>Newland, 45, was extradited to the US on September 22. A statement from the Department of Justice says that Newland “conspired with Inigo Philbrick to take advantage of the lack of transparency in the art market” in an “extensive fraud” that involved selling more than 100 per cent of ownership in an artwork. Conspiracy to commit wire fraud carries a maximum prison term of 20 years, the statement says, but adds that “sentencing of the defendant will be determined by a judge”.</p>  <p>Antonacci Lapiccirella gallery has brought the tale of a trick to this year's postponed Biennale Internazionale dell'Antiquariato di Firenze (BIAF, the Florence Biennale of Art and Antiques), which runs until October 2. Marking the 200th anniversary of the death of Antonio Canova, his “Self-portrait of Giorgione” (1792) was the work that crowned the artist, famed for his sculpture, as a leading painter too. As its title suggests, Canova's work was successfully presented to Rome's artists and intellectuals as a self-portrait by the renowned Venetian Giorgione, who died in 1510. In fact, Canova had made the work on a 16th-century panel, painting over a depiction of the Holy Family — recorded contemporaneously and confirmed by subsequent infrared investigation.</p> <p>The work, now offered for €550,000, was tracked down by the gallery, which has made it the centre of its BIAF booth and is receiving much interest at the lively fair, says Francesca Antonacci, who runs the gallery with Damiano Lapiccirella. It is, however, not able to leave Italy due to the country's stringent and controversial export laws. The work will be shown at the exhibition <em>Giorgione and Canova: The Story of a Prank </em>at the Casa Giorgione Museum, Castelfranco Veneto (October 14-February 15 2023).</p><p>Source: Melanie Gerlis 2022 'Sotheby's gets $100mn collection of postwar art' FT.com 29 September.
