  "title": "EU to Probe Microsoft's $75 Billion Deal for Activision Blizzard More Deeply; Watchdog group says it is concerned the acquisition could reduce competition in the global videogaming industry",
  "text": "<p>\"We must ensure that opportunities remain for future and existing distributors of PC and console videogames, as well as for rival suppliers of PC operating systems,\" the Commission said. \"The point is to ensure that the gaming ecosystem remains vibrant to the benefit of users in a sector that is evolving at a fast pace.\"</p><p>The shift to an in-depth probe, also known as a phase-two investigation, signals that the regulator is concerned the deal could restrict competition within the bloc. Phase-two reviews typically involve more extensive information gathering and detailed requests for information from competitors.</p><p>The Commission said it has 90 working days, until March 23, to make a decision.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company is continuing to work with the Commission on potential next steps and to address any valid marketplace concerns. \"We've said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation,\" she said. \"We want people to have more access to games, not less.\"</p><p>Sony Group Corp. didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The maker of PlayStation consoles and Microsoft's main videogaming rival has previously raised concerns about its ability to offer its customers access to popular Activision games if the deal goes through.</p><p>EU to Probe Microsoft's $75 Billion Deal for Activision Blizzard More Deeply</p>",
