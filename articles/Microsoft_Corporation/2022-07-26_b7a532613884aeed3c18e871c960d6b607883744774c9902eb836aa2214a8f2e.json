  "title": "Google Sales Growth Slows as Pressures Mount on Ad Market; Online advertising remains in focus for investors as an industry critical to the health of many internet companies",
  "text": "<p>Alphabet posted $69.69 billion of second-quarter revenue on Tuesday, up almost 13% from the same period last year, according to the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet. That would be the slowest rate of growth since the second quarter of 2020, when the pandemic crimped demand for advertising in some areas, including travel.</p><p>Google, which has a dominant share in the markets for internet search, navigation and video streaming, is considered a bellwether for the strength of online advertising. The slowdown, on the heels of weak results from social-media companies Twitter Inc. and Snap Inc. last week, suggests further weakness in an industry critical to the health of many internet companies.</p><p>Shares rose by more than 3% in after-hours trading, reflecting the extent to which investors had braced for disappointing earnings given the broader fallout in digital ads.</p><p>Google's second-quarter sales trailed Wall Street expectations by almost $190 million. Net income dropped 13.6% to $16 billion, below the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet.</p><p>Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said this month the company would slow hiring for the rest of the year, urging employees to be \"more entrepreneurial, working with greater urgency, sharper focus, and more hunger than we've shown on sunnier days.\" A Google spokesman said last week it would pause most new hiring for two weeks so that teams can better plan staffing needs.</p><p>YouTube, Google's video-streaming business, generated $7.3 billion in advertising revenue during the second quarter, extending a slowdown in growth as it competes for viewers with services such as ByteDance Ltd.'s TikTok. Analysts expected sales climbed 4.8% compared with the same period last year, after they rose more than 14% in the first quarter.</p><p>Investors were watching whether Google's search business \"can continue its remarkable run\" after cracks have begun showing in YouTube and the broader online advertising sector, analysts at Bernstein wrote last week.</p><p>On Friday, Twitter said \"advertising industry headwinds associated with the macroenvironment\" contributed to a decline in revenue during the quarter as the company withdrew forward-looking guidance.</p><p>The day before Twitter's earnings, Snap reported its weakest-ever quarterly sales growth as a public company, sending shares plummeting more than 26% in after-hours trading.</p><p>MoffettNathanson analysts lowered their overall expectations for online advertising companies last week to \"factor in further macroeconomic weakness,\" including the strengthening U.S. dollar.</p><p>Sales in the Google Cloud division rose 35.6% from a year ago to $6.28 billion in the second quarter. The business recorded an operating loss of $858 million during the quarter, reflecting Google's heavy spending push as it attempts to catch up to Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. in the cloud market.</p><p>Write to Miles Kruppa at miles.kruppa@wsj.com</p><p>Google Sales Growth Slows as Pressures Mount on Ad Market</p>",
