  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Friday's Markets: Dow, S&P And Nasdaq Rack Up More Losses",
  "text": "<p>Investors were still assessing the outlook for interest rates and how fast the Federal Reserve will move to tame inflation, roiling the stock and bond markets. At the same time, a rise in Covid-19 cases has weighed on sentiment, although there are signs that infections may be nearing a peak.</p><p>The week started on shaky footing, with stocks broadly falling and the Nasdaq nearing a correction before closing slightly higher. On Tuesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reaffirmed the central bank's view that inflation will likely peak by the middle of the year, while also suggesting interest rates will remain low. That helped halt a streak of declines for the S&amp;P 500 and Dow industrials.</p><p>Stocks, especially hard-hit sectors such as tech, appeared to regain some ground. But new pricing data released Wednesday and Thursday showed inflation remained hot last month, complicating the outlook. Stocks dropped Thursday, led by a 2.5% slide in the Nasdaq.</p><p>Lackluster earnings from some big U.S. banks, along with weak retail sales and manufacturing data, sent most of the market lower again on Friday until a late-session buying rush pushed the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq back into positive territory. The S&amp;P 500 added 3.82 points, or less than 0.1%, to 4662.85, and the Nasdaq gained 86.94 points, or 0.6%, to 14893.75. The Dow fell 201.81 points, or 0.6%, to 35911.81.</p><p>\"We expect a more volatile environment, with big up days and big down days. Perception of inflation will be a driving force in the direction of the market,\" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth US. \"It will be a bumpy ride.\"</p><p>The late Friday turnaround wasn't enough to avert another down week. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq ended up falling 0.3% over the last five trading days, while the Dow shed 0.9%. Markets are closed Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.</p><p>On Friday, the first dose of fourth-quarter earnings reports gave investors a sobering outlook. Quarterly profits fell by double-digit percentages at JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, ending a hot streak of big gains for most of 2021.</p><p>Shares of JPMorgan Chase slid $10.34, or 6.1%, to $157.89, and Citigroup dropped 85 cents, or 1.3%, to $66.93. Wells Fargo bucked the trend, adding $2.06, or 3.7%, to $58.06, after the bank reported that profit soared 86% in the final three months of 2021.</p><p>BlackRock posted higher quarterly profit, and market gains lifted the investment firm's assets under management above $10 trillion. Despite that, its shares declined $18.98, or 2.2%, to $848.60.</p><p>Some buying of large-cap growth stocks gave the market, and the Nasdaq, some support. Facebook parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Tesla and Netflix all gained more than 1%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
