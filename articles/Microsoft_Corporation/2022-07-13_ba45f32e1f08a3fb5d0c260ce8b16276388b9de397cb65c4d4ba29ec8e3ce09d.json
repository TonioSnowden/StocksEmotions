  "text": "<p>Netflix Inc. said it selected Microsoft Corp. as its technology and sales partner as the streaming giant prepares to offer a low-cost, advertising-supported streaming plan.</p><p>Netflix said in April that it was looking to give consumers an ad-supported option to help boost subscription growth and generate a new stream of revenue. In the March quarter the company posted its first loss of subscribers in more than a decade.</p><p>\"Microsoft has the proven ability to support all our advertising needs,\" Netflix Chief Operating Officer Greg Peters said in a statement. \"More importantly, Microsoft offered the flexibility to innovate over time on both the technology and sales side, as well as strong privacy protections for our members.\"</p><p>Netflix has had discussions with other potential advertising partners including Comcast Corp. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, and is hunting for an executive to spearhead the creation of the ad-supported tier, The Wall Street Journal has reported.</p><p>\"It's very early days and we have much to work through. But our long term goal is clear. More choice for consumers and a premium, better-than-linear TV brand experience for advertisers,\" Mr. Peters said.</p><p>Write to Sarah Krouse at sarah.krouse+1@wsj.com</p><p>Netflix Partners With Microsoft for New Advertising-Backed Option</p>",
