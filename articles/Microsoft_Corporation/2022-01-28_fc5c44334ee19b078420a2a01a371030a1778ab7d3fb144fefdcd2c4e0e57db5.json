  "text": "<p>   Others jumped into the market on Monday, when the Nasdaq fell by as much as 4.9% around midday, to buy shares or sell options, a bullish trade that could profit if stocks rebounded, traders said. This may have helped exacerbate the wild trading that day, in which the Nasdaq ultimately posted a modest gain, and the Dow clawed back losses of more than 1,000 points. </p><p>   Individual investors have still been buying small dips in tech, finance and energy stocks, according to Giacomo Pierantoni, head of data at research firm Vanda Research. Net inflows from individual investors into all U.S.-listed stocks and ETFs have averaged $1.4 billion a day so far in January, up from $1 billion a day in December, Vanda data shows. </p><p>   Individual investor appetite has waned for some once-hot technology stocks. Since December, the daily buying by individuals of stocks such as Apple, chip maker Advanced Micro Devices and Chinese electric-car maker NIO has fallen, according to Vanda. Meanwhile, individuals have stepped up purchases of Ford, Microsoft Corp. and some popular index funds such as the SPDR S&amp;P 500. </p><p>   Mark Stoeckle, chief executive of fund manager Adams Funds, and his team has been eyeing a number of stocks hit by the pullback, including shares of some medical technology companies. Some look more attractive than they did in December. But with open questions about inflation and the Fed's pace of rate increases, he has remained on the sidelines. </p><p>   \"I would rather wait and give up a little bit than jump into the unknown,\" he said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Juliet Chung and Alexander Osipovich contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
