  "text": "<p>\"Sometimes there are areas to make progress [where] you have three people making decisions. Understanding that and bringing it down to two or one improves your velocity by 20%,\" Mr. Pichai said. He didn't spell out how he was measuring those improvements.</p><p>Mr. Pichai pointed to macroeconomic concerns affecting advertising and consumer spending, which affect Google's business.</p><p>\"To me, those are all factors outside of our control,\" Mr. Pichai said. \"What you can focus on is what you're prioritizing.\"</p><p>The comments add to the reset that Mr. Pichai signaled in a memo to staffin July, when he said Google would be \"slowing the pace of hiring for the rest of the year, while still supporting our most important opportunities.\" Google hired about 10,000 new employees in the second quarter and more who are committed to start this quarter, he added. Alphabet reported 163,906 employees as of the end of March, up 17% from a year earlier.</p><p>The Google boss previously raised concerns about employee productivity following an increase in hiring during the pandemic. During an internal meeting in July, he asked staff for ideas on how to improve focus across the company.</p><p>Silicon Valley is moving rapidly to adapt to the cooling economy after the pandemic fueled demand for its products, spurring some companies to hire at breakneck speed. Social-media company Snap Inc. last week said it would slash about 20% of its staff after growing its head count by around 65% since the end of 2020.</p><p>Online brokerage Robinhood Markets Inc. last month said it was cutting about 23% of its full-time staff after a sharp slowdown in customer trading activity.</p><p>Google's moves are more akin to those at some of the biggest tech companies. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. has said it would shrink some teams as it adjusts priorities and software giant Microsoft Corp. is trimming its staff at its Modern Life Experiences group that develops consumer software products.</p><p>Alphabet in July reported the slowest quarterly sales growth in two years, as macroeconomic pressures weigh on the market for digital ads, and there are signs the disruptions could last. Snap, in announcing its layoffs, said it was bracing for a period of low sales growth stretching into next year. Warner Bros. Discovery Inc., home of cable channels including CNN, TNT and the Food Network, last month cut its outlook for this year and next in part because of a slowdown in advertising.</p><p>Write to Miles Kruppa at miles.kruppa@wsj.com</p><p>Google CEO Sundar Pichai Aims for 20% Productivity Gain</p>",
