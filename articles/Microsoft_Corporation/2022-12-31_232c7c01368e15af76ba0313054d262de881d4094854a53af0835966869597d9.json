  "text": "<p>Top Republicans were unwilling to consider any immigration-related changes amid an unprecedented surge of illegal immigration at the border, with some previously bipartisan proposals shedding GOP support as the 2022 congressional session came to a close. Fears over the border were amplified by the impending termination of Title 42, a pandemic-era border policy allowing migrants to be rapidly turned back to Mexico. That policy was set to expire last week but was held up by the Supreme Court, which announced it would hear a case on the policy.</p><p>Concern over the policy was so great that a GOP amendment requiring the Biden administration to keep Title 42 in place briefly stalled the spending package, threatening a potential government shutdown before congressional leaders brokered a workaround.</p><p>\"When the border is on fire, it's really hard to come together and cut a deal and limit the more extreme voices on the far right and the far left,\" said Matthew La Corte, government affairs manager for immigration policy at the Niskanen Center, a center-right-leaning think tank. \"Until the politics of fixing the immigration system outweigh the politics of border chaos, I think we're going to be in this no man's land.\"</p><p>Among the failed proposals were bills offering a path to citizenship for farmworkers in the country illegally, for Afghans evacuated to the U.S. in 2021 after the Taliban retook power and for Dreamers, the immigrants here unlawfully who were brought to the country as children.</p><p>Another proposal would have significantly shortened the wait for Indians caught in a green-card backlog that some analysts estimate could last decades.</p><p>Prospects for reform will only grow tougher in the next two years as Republicans take over the House, where Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), the expected next speaker, has said he won't take up any immigration bills unless they deal first with bolstering border security. Republicans are also expected to make the Biden administration's handling of border flows a subject of oversight hearings in 2023.</p><p>\"There's an increasing number of Democrats who recognize they actually do have a crisis at the border,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis (R., N.C.), who led bipartisan negotiations with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I., Ariz.) over a potential deal to create a path to citizenship for Dreamers.</p><p>Those negotiations petered out in the last couple of weeks amid tepid support from Mr. Tillis's Republican colleagues in the Senate.</p><p>Sens. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) and Michael Crapo (R., Idaho) held months of talks over a proposed agricultural immigration deal that would provide a legalization pathway for a million farmworkers in the country illegally in exchange for an expanded farmworker visa program and mandatory use of E-Verify for agricultural employers.</p><p>Another bill, known as the Afghan Adjustment Act, would have provided a permanent legal status for some 80,000 Afghans evacuated to the U.S. who currently must apply for asylum or be vulnerable to future deportation.</p><p>A bill championed by tech companies, including Google and Microsoft, which would lift the cap on green cards that can be issued to applicants from any one country to help Indian and some Chinese applicants caught in the backlog, stalled in the House as Democratic leaders tried and failed to corral enough support.</p><p>---</p><p>Siobhan Hughes and Lindsay Wise contributed to this article.</p>",
