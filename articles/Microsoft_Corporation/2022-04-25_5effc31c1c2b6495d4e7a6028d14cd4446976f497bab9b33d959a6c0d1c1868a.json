  "text": "<p>Emmanuel Macron defeated his far-right rival Marine Le Pen to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a5a525b-a459-4741-b3d4-ca335cdc2d33\">be re-elected president of France</a>, vowing to tackle the country's “doubts and divisions” during his second five-year term.</p> <p>Le Pen conceded shortly after the first projections showed Macron winning more than 58 per cent of yesterday's presidential run-off. The far-right leader said her Rassemblement National party would fight on in elections for France's National Assembly in June. </p> <p>Speaking to supporters in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Macron acknowledged he would have to preside over a divided nation in his second term after many backed his rival or failed to vote.</p> <p>“Our country is beset by doubts and divisions,” he said. “Today's vote requires us to consider all the hardships of people's lives and to respond effectively to them and to the anger expressed.”</p> <p>Victory for Macron, first elected in 2017, comes as a relief to investors and to France's EU and Nato allies in the midst of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A win for the Eurosceptic Le Pen, who wanted to pull France out of Nato's military command structure, would have been a geopolitical earthquake akin to Brexit or the election of Donald Trump.</p> <p>However, Le Pen's far-right party had its best showing since the second world war and 28 per cent of voters did not turn out — the highest level of abstention since 1969. More than half of voters in the first round two weeks ago voted for nationalist, Eurosceptic candidates of the extreme right or left.</p> <h1>Read more on the French election</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Macron's convincing victory disguises the reality that the nationalist, Eurosceptic, anti-immigration far-right <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9f41cef-f5f8-4013-bdc2-196990b5f840\">is stronger than at any time since the second world war</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Instant Insight:</strong> Emmanuel Macron's strategy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3750b6a-c3c6-45b9-9f73-df9b168d07ad\">paid off handsomely</a>, writes Ben Hall. He was counting on French voters to close ranks against the far-right — the so-called republican front — to prevail once again. But the level of abstentions is hardly a ringing endorsement of Macronism, he says.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Gideon Rachman:</strong> This is Macron's chance <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/088bc91c-edf5-472d-800c-75d0421d9fd5\">to shape Europe's future</a>, writes the FT's chief foreign affairs commentator.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Did you breath a little easier when you heard Macron had won or did you hope for a Le Pen victory?

The shock announcement led to questions about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd376c16-f8d7-49fd-9b13-9ed2f001eaa1\">the future of Netflix</a> and its business model. Bas van Buijtenen, a reader living in Switzerland, shared these thoughts:</p> <blockquote>  <p>I believe there is worse to come. The fundamental rot set in when Netflix decided to pivot from being a distributor of other peoples content to becoming essentially a content provider, a studio. My prediction is that each of the streaming services will hit this problem: exclusive distribution of proprietary content will not be a profitable business model. </p> </blockquote> <p><em>Thanks for all your comments.
