  "text": "<p>\"How does he feel about something that says vaccines kill people or that Bill Gates is tracking people?\" Gates said, adding, \"It's not totally clear what he is going to do.\"</p><p>In a recent tweet, Musk confirmed that he confronted Gates about shorting Tesla Inc. In the tweets, Gates had contacted his fellow billionaire to discuss philanthropy in climate change, but Musk asked if Gates still had a $500 million short position in Tesla TSLA. Gates responded that he hadn't closed it out, to which Musk said he couldn't take Gates's philanthropy seriously if he was shorting the electric-car maker.</p><p>Gates didn't directly answer a question about whether he had personally shorted Tesla, saying that climate change was a focus of the Gates Foundation. \"I don't think whether one's short or long Tesla is a statement about your seriousness about climate change,\" Gates said. \"I applaud Tesla's role in helping with climate change.\"</p><p>He added, \"I have nothing but positive things to say about Elon. If he makes Twitter worse, fine, I'll speak out about that, but I wouldn't assume that's what's going to happen.\"</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Where state abortion laws stand if Roe v.
