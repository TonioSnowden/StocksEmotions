  "text": "<p>An activist investor wants more of a makeover at Kohl's. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Macellum Advisors GP LLC, which has a roughly 5% stake in Kohl's, is urging the company to make changes that include altering its board or to explore a sale. Over the past year, Kohl's made a number of changes, including reinstating a dividend and boosting its share repurchases. The issues at Kohl's predate the pandemic, as department stores and mall-based chains lost shoppers to e-commerce and other retailers. Kohl's shares added 4.1% Tuesday.</p><p>EXXON MOBIL CORP.</p><p>XOM +1.7%</p><p>Exxon said it is taking its greenhouse-gas emissions down to zero -- but didn't commit to reducing emissions from the use of its fuels. The oil giant said Tuesday it would reach its goal by 2050. This goal doesn't cover emissions from consumer use of its products such as oil and gas, which make up most of the emissions connected to the company. Oil producers face mounting pressure from investors to respond to climate change. With Exxon's announcement, all of the largest Western oil companies have now made so-called net-zero commitments. Exxon shares rose 1.7% Tuesday.</p><p>ACTIVISION BLIZZARD INC.</p><p>ATVI +26%</p><p>Microsoft's decision to buy Activision Blizzard powered up videogame stocks. After Tuesday's $75 billion announcement, shares of Electronic Arts Inc., Ubisoft Entertainment SA and Nintendo Co. jumped as investors placed bets on the rapidly consolidating industry. Deal-making among videogame companies has surged in recent years as gaming has become more popular on mobile devices. Activision soared 26% Tuesday.</p><p>PROCTER &amp; GAMBLE CO.</p><p>PG +3.4%</p><p>Shoppers are paying up for Pampers diapers and Gillette razors. Pricing at household staple maker Procter &amp; Gamble on average rose 3% in the latest quarter, the company said, and price increases accounted for half of the company's revenue growth in the period. The results offer another sign of how inflation is pushing up prices on everything from used cars to grocery items. The added revenue helped P&amp;G offset soaring prices for raw materials, labor and transportation of goods, as supply-chain woes continue to weigh on almost every industry. P&amp;G shares added 3.4% Wednesday.</p><p>MORGAN STANLEY</p><p>MS +1.8%</p><p>Wall Street is banking on deal making again. Morgan Stanley profit rose 9% in the recent quarter, buoyed by gains in investment banking in a booming market for deals. Other banks also reported investment banking gains. But trading revenues slowed as market volatility subsided; Morgan Stanley's stock and bond trading revenue fell 6%. Meanwhile, Wall Street firms are offering bigger paydays to attract and keep employees in a tight labor market. Full-year compensation expenses at Morgan Stanley rose 18% to $24.6 billion. Its shares increased 1.8% Wednesday.</p><p>AMERICAN AIRLINES GROUP INC.</p><p>AAL -3.2%</p><p>Omicron keeps offering new turbulence to the airline industry. Even though holiday travel helped U.S. airlines bring in more revenue at the end of last year than any quarter since the pandemic began, major carriers still lost money amid a surge in Covid cases. American Airlines said Thursday it expects to fly 8% to 10% less in the first quarter than it did in the comparable period of 2019 and flying capacity for the full year to be down 5% from pre-pandemic levels. Airline executives said bookings have started to come back as people plan trips. American shares fell 3.2% Thursday.</p><p>NETFLIX INC.</p><p>NFLX -22%</p><p>Are Netflix investors changing the channel? Shares in the streaming giant dropped 22% Friday after Netflix reported slowing subscriber growth Thursday. The company forecast an increase of 2.5 million subscribers in the current quarter, compared with 4 million a year earlier, citing competition and lasting disruptions from the pandemic. Netflix also said it expects to add a much smaller number of subscribers this quarter than it did a year ago. The subscriber miss came despite a strong lineup of movies and TV shows, including the satire \"Don't Look Up.\"</p>",
