Traders of fed-funds futures also see an 86% likelihood that the Federal Reserve delivers a 75 basis point rate hike in June, up from 19% a month ago, based on the CME FedWatch Tool.</p><p>See: A half-point Fed rate hike seen already baked in the cake</p><p>Intense inflationary pressures, plus broad supply and labor bottlenecks, were reflected in the Institute for Supply Management's index of U.S. manufacturing activity on Monday: That index fell 1.7 points to 55.4% in Apriland showed the industrial side of the economy grew at the slowest clip in 18 months.
