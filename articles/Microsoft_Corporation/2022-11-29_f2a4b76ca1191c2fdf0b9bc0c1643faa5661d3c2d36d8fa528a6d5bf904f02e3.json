  "title": "Arizona County Postpones Certifying Election Results, Setting Up Legal Fight; The Democratic secretary of state sued Cochise County over refusal to certify election results",
  "text": "<p>Election Updates</p><p>* Live Results</p><p>* How Different Groups Voted</p><p>Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat who won the gubernatorial race against Republican Kari Lake, filed suit Monday afternoon in Cochise County, asking a judge to force the county's Board of Supervisors to meet and certify the election results by Dec. 1.</p><p>As secretary of state, Ms. Hobbs is the chief elections administrator but wasn't involved in ballot counting.</p><p>Arizona law required counties to certify election results by the end of Monday. The two GOP members of the three-person board of supervisors in Cochise County voted Monday to push the decision until Friday, citing questions about the state's vote-counting machines.</p><p>Mohave County, meanwhile, voted unanimously in the afternoon to certify because of the legal requirement, after some members initially expressed reservations earlier in the day. Both rural counties are solidly Republican and haven't cited any issues with voting in their counties.</p><p>Arizona, once a Republican stronghold, has become more competitive over the past several election cycles. The state favored President Biden in 2020 by 10,000 votes and became one of a few states that former President Donald Trump and his allies falsely claimed was stolen. Trump-backed candidates and purveyors of election fraud theories around the country had mixed success in the midterms, but Arizona is the only state this cycle where high-profile Republican candidates who lost refuse to concede.</p><p>In a nine-minute meeting Monday, Cochise County Supervisor Tom Crosby, a Republican, said there were still too many unanswered questions about the state's certification of voting machines. It was the second time in less than a week that the county board, in votes of 2-1, opted to postpone certification. The lone Democrat opposed the decision, saying she believed the certification should move forward.</p><p>\"There is no reason for us to delay,\" said Ann English, the panel's chair. \"We have heard from every person more than once how they feel about the certification of the machines. I feel that you both have the information to make the decision that is nondiscretionary.\"</p><p>Cochise County had no known issues on Election Day with tabulation of ballots.</p><p>Maricopa County, the state's most populous, did have problems with ballot printers that caused some tabulators not to accept some ballots. County officials say all of the ballots that were cast legally were counted later. On Monday, the GOP-majority board of the county, which includes Phoenix, certified the results by unanimous consent.</p><p>\"I am proud of the way our Elections Department responded to unexpected challenges on Election Day,\" said Board Chairman Bill Gates, a Republican. \"I am confident the canvass provides an accurate tally of all legal votes.\"</p><p>Last week, Mohave County Supervisor Hildy Angius, a Republican, said the decision to postpone the certification until Monday was \"a political statement\" because the county was unhappy with how Maricopa County ran its election, according to the Arizona Republic. On Monday afternoon, she asked for more time to explore options, and the board broke before reconvening later in the afternoon. When the board met again, Ms. Angius said the county should certify.</p><p>\"To not certify this election at all, which I don't think was ever our intent, would certainly disenfranchise the voters of Mohave County and hurt our candidates who worked so hard to get elected,\" she said.</p><p>This cycle, all four GOP candidates for statewide races ran as allies of Mr. Trump and repeated his false claims of fraud in the 2020 election. There is no evidence of fraud widespread enough to change the results of that election or the 2022 midterms.</p><p>Ms. Lake, the former news anchor and GOP candidate for governor, venture capitalist Blake Masters, who was the candidate for U.S. Senate, and state Rep. Mark Finchem, who ran to be secretary of state, all lost their races. Only Mr. Masters has conceded his race. Ms. Lake and Mr. Finchem have both alleged voter suppression because of the issues in Maricopa County. Abraham Hamadeh, an intelligence officer in the Army Reserve, is 510 votes behind his opponent Kris Mayes, a former state corporation commissioner; in the contest for state attorney general; that race will now go to an automatic recount as required by state law.</p><p>Ms. Lake and Mr. Hamadeh have both filed lawsuits related to their races.</p><p>Ms. Lake filed a lawsuit dated Nov. 23 demanding records from Maricopa County that included records related to voters who tried to cast ballots on Nov. 8, \"voided, spoiled, canceled or unaccounted for\" ballots, and communications about tabulation-machine problems in advance of Election Day. Her lawyer Timothy La Sota said Monday in a text message he hadn't heard back from Maricopa County.</p><p>Mr. Hamadeh along with the Republican National Committee also filed a lawsuit alleging that errors by poll workers might have influenced the results of the race. The lawsuit requests that he be certified the winner. Lawyers for Mr. Hamadeh said in a court filing that they aren't \"alleging any fraud, manipulation or other intentional wrongdoing that would impugn the outcomes of the Nov. 8 general election.\" A lawyer for Ms. Mayes said last week that Mr. Hamadeh's lawsuit was \"devoid of any facts.\"</p><p>During a first hearing Monday in Mr. Hamadeh's lawsuit in Maricopa County Superior Court, lawyers for the state's counties argued that the case was premature, given that the state has yet to certify the election results. The judge, Randall Warner, said he would rule on that question in the coming days.</p><p>Write to Eliza Collins at eliza.collins+1@wsj.com. and Alicia A.
