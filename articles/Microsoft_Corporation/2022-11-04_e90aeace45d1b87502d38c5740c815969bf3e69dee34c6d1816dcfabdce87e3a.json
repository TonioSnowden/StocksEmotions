  "text": "<p>   In Arizona, after armed activists began monitoring ballot drop boxes, two Republican officials in Maricopa County issued an unusual joint statement to poll watchers: \"Don't dress in body armor to intimidate voters as they are legally returning their ballots.\" </p><p>   In Pennsylvania, the Democrat who oversees the state's elections has embarked on a public speaking tour to explain why delays and other unevenness in reporting election results is normal -- and not an indicator of fraud. </p><p>   In Georgia, the GOP secretary of state who rebuffed former President Donald Trump's efforts to change the state's 2020 election results is highlighting a new text-messaging service that allows poll workers to quickly report threats and other disruptions on Election Day. </p><p>   The officials, along with other election administrators nationwide, are bracing for a range of challenges ahead of Tuesday's midterm elections, including abuse directed toward poll workers and citizen-led surveillance of voters and election equipment. </p><p>   Mr. Trump, a Republican, and his allies made unsubstantiated election-fraud claims when they disputed Democrat Joe Biden's presidential victory two years ago. They lost dozens of lawsuits that challenged the 2020 results. The Justice Department said there were no signs of widespread fraud. </p><p>   Since then, a number of election administrators say threats and harassment have become a backdrop to their work. Some are resigning, citing burnout and worries about their safety. </p><p>   \"I'm concerned about bad behavior,\" said Bill Gates, a Republican who leads the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors. During early voting, activists have approached and harassed electionworkers, he said. </p><p>   Citing concerns about voter fraud, the conservative groups Lions of Liberty and Clean Elections USA undertook campaigns to monitor ballot drop boxes in Arizona last month. </p><p>   On Oct. 22, the Maricopa County Elections Department shared surveillance camera footage of two armed and masked individuals monitoring the drop boxes while wearing tactical gear. Voters complained that poll watchers were following people who dropped off ballots and taking photos of their license plates. </p><p>   The voter-intimidation complaints were referred to the Justice Department, which on Monday filed a legal brief that raised alarm about \"vigilante ballot security efforts.\" </p><p>   The brief was submitted in litigation before a federal judge in Phoenix. </p><p>   In a temporary restraining order issued Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Michael Liburdi in Phoenix set sharp limits on what the activists can do. Among other conditions, he prohibited them from coming within 75 feet of drop boxes, carrying guns openly within 250 feet of the boxes and speaking to people depositing ballots unless spoken to first. </p><p>   Alexander Kolodin, a lawyer for Clean Elections USA, said parts of the judge's order interfere with the group's First Amendment rights. </p><p>   Election officials say they are hopeful they can protect voters and poll workers on Tuesday. </p><p>   Georgia last month rolled out a security alert service allowing poll managers across the state to quickly report Election Day security incidents to law enforcement. </p><p>   Stakeouts of ballot drop boxes don't appear to be a widespread problem, said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, a nonprofit that advises elections officials. </p><p>   \"The goal of some of these people is to scare voters, to get them in essence to self-suppress and not show up,\" said Mr. Becker. </p><p>   Mr. Becker said a crucial test for elections officials will come days after Election Day, when the public watches results trickle in. </p><p>   It is a particular concern in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, which takes longer than other states to report results because of a law limiting when mail votes can be processed. </p><p>   Leigh Chapman, a Democrat who is Pennsylvania's acting secretary of state, has spoken extensively about the intricacy of Pennsylvania law to inform and prepare the public. </p><p>   \"As the count is going, that's an opportunity for people to spread disinformation and misinformation,\" Ms. Chapman said Monday at an event at the Center for American Progress, a Democratic think tank. </p><p></p>",
