  "text": "<p>The latest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9601a1a-ab3b-4059-8ca3-67b8387b6170\">major network security breach</a> in the US advertises the advantages of the cloud, but also emphasises the greater perils faced by organisations as superpower hacking continues to escalate.</p> <p>To recap: Microsoft<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/\"> warned in a blog post</a> last Tuesday that on-premises versions of Microsoft Exchange Server had come under attack, opening up access to email accounts and allowing the installation of malware for further snooping. It blamed Hafnium, a group of state-sponsored hackers based in China. Exchange Online was not affected and Microsoft made patches available to close the holes.</p> <p>Late on Thursday, Jake Sullivan, US National Security Adviser, said in a tweet that the White House was “tracking . . . reports of potential compromises of US think tanks and defence industrial base entities”.&#xa0;Brian Krebs, a cyber security researcher, claimed in a blog post on Friday that at least 30,000 organisations “including a significant number of small businesses, towns, cities and local governments” had been hacked in the past few days. Microsoft said there were now multiple malicious actors exploiting the vulnerability.</p> <p>Over the weekend, the White House dealt with what it described as “an active threat still developing” by setting up a task force for “a whole of government response”. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/us/politics/microsoft-solarwinds-hack-russia-china.html\">The New York Times reported</a> the Biden administration was already planning over the next three weeks “a series of clandestine actions across Russian networks that are intended to be evident to President Vladimir V. Putin and his intelligence services and military but not to the wider world”.</p> <p>The cyber attacks would be in retaliation for last year's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2bed3013-b21f-4b2c-8572-b2da016d1b4e\">SolarWinds hack</a> of network management software that gave access to some 18,000 organisations' systems. It's unclear what Russia and China were seeking from their separate breaches, but as a show of their cyber powers, it is now set to be matched by one from the US.</p> <p>Companies and organisations need to be more aware their networks are soft targets and cloud providers should be alert to their services being used to disguise the source of attacks. Individuals may be more exercised right now about<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c19dceda-c8c8-4cde-80ce-80372692237c\"> the decision by LastPass</a> to start charging users for its password manager from next week, if they still want to use it for access to protected sites from all their devices.</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Deliveroo on its bike for IPO</strong><br>Deliveroo has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c99cc71-54ab-46a6-bfa2-7665ef8f56b1\">unveiled its plans </a>for its London stock market debut as it revealed a 54 per cent growth in sales but losses of £224m in 2020.

The race to scale up green hydrogen</strong><br>For decades, hydrogen has been hailed as a potentially revolutionary alternative to fossil fuels but its high costs and complexities have stunted attempts at creating whole new economies.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/bhQmSOrnbQU0J1-IHeOLEQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRiKEJUP0Q6aHR0cDovL2Z0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzdlYWM1NGVlLWYxZDEtNGViYy05NTczLWI1MmY4N2QwMDI0MFcIZmludGltZXNCCmBBd71FYCtX7aZSFGNocmlzLm51dHRhbGxAZnQuY29tWAQAAAAA?emailId=6045f0537bcb580004957f52&amp;segmentId=3934ec55-f741-7a04-feb0-1ddf01985dc2\">Can the gas help solve the world's dirtiest energy problems</a>?&#xa0;asks today's Big Read.</p> <p><strong>5.
