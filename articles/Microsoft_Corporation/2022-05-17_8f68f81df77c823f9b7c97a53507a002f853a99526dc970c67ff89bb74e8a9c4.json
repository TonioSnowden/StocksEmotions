  "title": "Free Expression:  The Search for a Sober Populism Will Continue After Pennsylvania  ----  By Gerard Baker",
  "text": "<p>   Republican voters in Pennsylvania on Tuesday face a choice not between the pre- and post-Trump GOP or between competing ideological visions in an age of rapidly advancing political opportunity for conservatives. Yet it is still an important choice. </p><p>   In the state that Mitt Romney, John McCain and George W. Bush all easily won in presidential primaries, there's no serious candidate for U.S. Senate offering to return the party to what now seems like the anachronistic consensus those three nominees represented. </p><p>   As in neighboring Ohio two weeks ago, the Keystone State's Republican foot soldiers are set to trample into the dust that milder, more inclusive but definitely less robust model of ancien regime conservatism, salt the earth, and march the GOP army on to the commanding heights of MAGAdom. </p><p>   The three main candidates vying for the Pennsylvania nomination are all firmly in the populist mold. But they still offer a choice with important implications for the wider Republican Party. </p><p>   The question for the state's primary voters is: How do you like your populism? Do you want it raw and true, instinctive and gut-sourced, warts and all? Or do you want it meticulously manufactured, recently acquired and worn like a neat-fitting suit? Do you want authenticity in your next senator -- and your party -- however deranged it may sound at times? Or do you want a convincing salesman, a neophyte with pitch-perfect recall, able to recite on demand the full lexicon of Trumpian populism while registering only the merest blip on the lie detector? </p><p>   The choice arises as a result of the sudden rise to contention of conservative commentator and military veteran Kathy Barnette. Her surge in the polls is a reminder of how much some voters crave something genuine. Outspent some 25 to 1 by her well-heeled opponents -- television physician Mehmet Oz and hedge-fund manager and former Bush administration official David McCormick -- she is nonetheless close in the polls. </p><p>   On the one hand: a pair of super-educated, newly minted MAGA men; on the other, a black woman with an astonishing personal story and a consistent record of speaking up for frustrated conservatives -- but also an unsettling history of alarming remarks (she once said pedophilia is a \"cornerstone\" of Islam, among other things). </p><p>   Mr. Oz, who enjoys the imprimatur of the former president, was until recently another talented member of the media elite. As recently as 2020, he was using his massive platform to spout usual progressive pieties about \"systemic racism\" and other issues. </p><p>   Mr. McCormick is equally talented. He served his country as a Treasury undersecretary, and unlike Mr. Oz has spent solid time tilling the Republican fields to good effect. But if he's a genuine populist, I'm the patriarch of Constantinople. </p><p>   When I edited the Journal's news pages a few years ago, I had many encounters with Mr. McCormick in his capacity as second in command of the world's largest hedge fund. He was always an avid and creative defender of his employer, which has played a vital role in helping communist China become the economic powerhouse it is today. </p><p>   Both men have traveled a long way; it's no wonder voters have started to look elsewhere. Now those voters have to ponder: Do they take a risk with a woman who has valid populist credentials but a history of such verbal incaution that she makes Donald Trump look like Calvin Coolidge? Or do they take a risk with men who say all the right things but whose grasp of conservative ideas is so recent that it still seems switched to factory settings? </p><p>   This is the wider problem for the GOP. </p><p>   Next door in Ohio, Senate nominee J.D. Vance was until 2016 -- a year of some significance -- a successful lawyer with a great story (told that year in his book, \"Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis\") and a record of fiercely criticizing Mr. Trump. It could even be said that the biggest phony of the lot is Mr. Trump himself, former ally of the Clintons and other unreliable causes. </p><p>   At root of all this is a larger truth about the party. As commentator John Ellis points out in his News Items Substack blog, Ms. Barnette is a reminder that Trumpism came before Mr. Trump announced his presidential candidacy in 2015. \"Trump didn't create the 'base,'\" Mr. Ellis writes. \"The base created him.\" </p><p>   It was Republican primary voters in 2016, tired of and angry at the unheeding futility of their previous leaders, who chose Mr. Trump. </p><p>   It has been obvious for some time that if the GOP can find a genuine standard-bearer for this ascendant conservative populism, shorn of the vulgar narcissism of the former president, the lunatic extremism of the QAnon crowd, and the transparent implausibility of neophyte MAGA types, it would have a winning formula. If it could find someone who hadn't conveniently recently discovered the damage from globalization, the tragedies of a hyperactive foreign policy, the injustice of soft-border immigration policy, and the erosion of the traditional values of American life without sounding like an anticonstitutional conspiracy theorist, that candidate would be a sure -- and authentic -- winner. </p><p>   Something tells me that after the Pennsylvania primary, the search will continue. </p><p></p>",
