  "text": "<p>Twenty eight years ago, when Bill Gates and his future wife Melinda visited Omaha for engagement ring shopping, Warren Buffett met them at the airport and escorted them to Borsheims, a jewellery business he bought four years earlier (“Bill and Melinda Gates to end marriage after 27 years”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04f3eaff-075a-495d-975b-50f2bd652eba\">Report</a>, May 5). </p> <p>The Berkshire Hathaway chief executive told Bill Gates, the richest man in the world at the time, that he spent 6 per cent of his net worth on an engagement ring in 1951, and Bill Gates who was worth $6.2bn in 1993, should do the same. Of course, the young couple decided to choose a ring which was much less than $370m. </p> <p>While a diamond is supposed to last for ever, a marriage, usually for the super-rich, has an expiry date. Bill Gates and Melinda managed to live together for 27 years, and their old friend Warren Buffett has put $27bn into the couple's charity foundation during the past 15 years.</p> <p>There are thousands of different reasons for the super-rich to divorce. When money is no longer an issue but time has become an increasingly rare commodity, it is very tempting to experience that kind of liberating moment, especially when a spiritually or intellectually or physically stimulating friend comes along. The family obstacles will also wither away as it is a trend for the modern billionaires to give very little, maybe just 1 per cent, of the net worth to their children. </p> <p>The only snag is that whether the 90-year-old Buffett will continue to donate the bulk of his $100bn fortune to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation after the couple have decided to go separate ways. </p> <p>Maybe Buffett is seeking some timely advice from his newly appointed successor, Greg Abel. </p> <p><strong>Khaw Wei Kang <br></strong><em>Shenzhen, China</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Diamonds shine for ever but marriage can fade' FT.com 9 May.
