Here are some of their priorities.</p> <p>We start with lessons from the current crisis.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Jack</strong>, global education editor and FT Health founder, says: </p> <blockquote>  <p>Even as policymakers cope with the continuing demands of coronavirus, they need to focus on two areas. The first is how to ensure investments being put in place for testing, surveillance and response can be sustained and scaled to apply to a wide range of future pandemic threats. That means more monitoring of a broader range of infectious diseases and better mechanisms to share information.</p>  <p>The second is to show humility by exploring and drawing lessons for their health systems from the varied responses to Covid-19 around the world. That includes identifying better funding models and operating structures, rebalancing investments between prevention, primary and more specialist care and exploring the links between care homes, home-based and hospital-based support for the elderly.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Clive Cookson</strong>, science editor, says policymakers must do more to tackle the world's other&#xa0;great infectious disease issue: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/future-antibiotics\">antimicrobial resistance</a>.</p> <blockquote>  <p>As well as stronger action to clamp down on overuse of existing antibiotics in people and in agriculture, we need governments to firm up financial initiatives for the pharma industry to invest in later stages of clinical trials and pull new antibiotics, which are being generated by small biotech companies and academic researchers, on to the market. </p>  <p>Models are under development to reward companies for producing drugs not on the basis of sales, but to be held back for when they are really needed — one in the UK and another proposed by the US <a href=\"https://www.bennet.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/b/5/b5032465-bf79-4dca-beba-50fb9b0f4aee/C1FD8B8C4143F1332DC6A5E5EC09C83B.bon20468.pdf\">Pasteur Act</a>, a bill introduced in Congress with bipartisan support. The G7 and G20 should take a lead in 2021, with governments setting clear benchmarks for progress to which they can be held accountable.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Darren Dodd</strong>, health writer and commissioning editor, says policymakers must urgently address the effects of the pandemic on mental health.</p> <blockquote>  <p>Lockdowns, bereavement, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsr.13231\">disrupted sleep</a> and the fear of infection, together with the huge increase in economic uncertainty have combined with a squeeze on existing treatments to create a fertile environment for mental ill-health. Women and ethnic minority groups appear to be disproportionately affected. Jumps in the use of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jan/01/covid-antidepressant-use-at-all-time-high-as-access-to-counselling-in-england-plunges\">antidepressants</a> are just one early warning sign of further problems ahead.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Hannah Kuchler</strong>, US pharma and biotech correspondent, points out this “second pandemic” of mental health problems has so far gone untreated as providers become overwhelmed. </p> <blockquote>  <p>Governments that poured money into research and development to speed Covid-19 vaccines to market should now be encouraged to invest in new solutions for treating mental health. The last couple of years have seen the first breakthroughs in pharmaceuticals for depression in decades: Johnson &amp; Johnson's ketamine-derived nasal spray Spravato and Sage Therapeutics first post-partum depression drug Zulresso. </p>  <p>An equivalent to Operation Warp Speed [the US vaccine project] for mental health could take other potential drugs into the clinic. Covid-19 could also help bring in improvements in digitally tracking what helps and what hurts. Large studies of mental health during the lockdowns, completed online and in real time, could accelerate our understanding.</p> </blockquote> <p>Thank you to all the FT Health readers who submitted some of their own priorities for 2021:</p> <p><strong>Mike Rann</strong>, chairman of the board of trustees of the <a href=\"https://www.powerofnutrition.org/\">Power of Nutrition</a> foundation, called for action on global malnutrition. </p> <blockquote>  <p>Before Covid-19 hit, undernutrition was already responsible for&#xa0;almost half of deaths of children under five. Stunting and wasting — due to undernutrition — causes cognitive and physical impairment, meaning children never develop to their full potential. There's also a big economic impact as nations suffer the effects of lost productivity. A stunted workforce means a stunted GDP. The ripple effect of Covid-19 in developing countries means we could see an&#xa0;additional 2.6m stunted children by 2022. An additional $1.2bn of funding (on top of the recommended $7bn to meet the World Health Assembly's nutrition targets) is needed per year to mitigate the effects.</p>  <p>These are shocking figures and the task ahead for national governments is huge. On top of committing development aid spending to tackle undernutrition, policymakers should look to build partnerships with philanthropic sources and the private sector to meet the challenge. This year has been designated the Year of Nutrition: in the lead up to the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth Summit next December we have a real and pressing opportunity to make a real difference.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Adeeba Kamarulzaman</strong>, president of the <a href=\"https://www.iasociety.org/\">International Aids Society</a>, suggested two priorities for policymakers:</p> <blockquote>  <p>We won't overcome HIV until we overcome inequalities, stigma and discrimination. And we won't beat zoonotic diseases until we stop invading the few wild places left on earth and begin respecting nature. </p>  <p>The Covid pandemic has re-emphasised both points and therefore my hope for 2021 is that we, as a global community, show greater respect for each other and for the natural world around us. It is in our own self-interest.</p> </blockquote> <h2>By invitation: WHO chief on health as an investment</h2> <p><em>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, writes:</em></p> <p>The fastest way to end the Covid-19 pandemic is to ensure that those at high risk across the world are vaccinated simultaneously. Through the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator\">ACT-Accelerator</a>, and its vaccine pillar — the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator/covax\">Covax facility</a> — the largest portfolio of vaccines and almost a billion doses have already been secured.</p> <p>But this is not enough: the accelerator's funding gap of $4.3bn needs to be filled quickly so that the new health tools can be secured and distributed to every country. This will save lives, stabilise hospitals and drive a truly global economic recovery.</p> <p>A recent <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/03-12-2020-global-access-to-covid-19-vaccines-estimated-to-generate-economic-benefits-of-at-least-153-billion-in-2020-21\">study</a> found that investing in equitable health tools is not only the morally right thing to do; it's the smart thing to do. Rich countries have already pumped $10tn into their economies. The cost of vaccinating the world equitably and ending the pandemic will pay for itself many times over as supply chains are reopened fully. In five years, those economic benefits would total $466bn.</p> <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has demonstrated the consequences of chronic under-investment in public health. But we don't just need more investment; we must also rethink how we value health.</p> <p>The WHO's new Council on the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/13-11-2020-who-establishes-council-on-the-economics-of-health-for-all\">Economics of Health for All</a>, staffed by leading economists and health experts, will put “health for all” at the centre of how we think about value creation and economic growth.</p> <p>Chaired by professor Mariana&#xa0;Mazzucato, the Council will flip common thinking on its head and develop a body of evidence that reflects that health is an investment in the future, not a short-term cost.</p> <p>We will end the pandemic together if we have a chance to learn together, so that we can prevent the next one, tackle the challenges of our time and realise “health for all”. All roads should lead to universal health coverage.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/spotlight/10-global-health-issues-to-track-in-2021\">WHO: Ten global issues to track in 2021</a></p> <h2>Covid catch-up</h2> <p>There may be welcome news on vaccines but the pandemic continues to rage.

After such a challenging year, the triumph of science — both practically and symbolically — is a crucial source of solace.” </p><p>Source: Darren Dodd and Andrew Jack 2021 'FT Health: Priorities for 2021' FT.com 6 January.
