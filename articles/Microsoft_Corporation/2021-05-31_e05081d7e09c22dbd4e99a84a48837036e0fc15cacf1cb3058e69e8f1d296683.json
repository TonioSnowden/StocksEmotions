  "text": "<p>The belief that Covid escaped from a Chinese laboratory is no longer being dismissed as a Trump provocation. As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/923e0256-7f7e-43ef-b4fe-64c066b8b70b\">Demetri Sevastopulo writes from Washington</a>, the order by US president Joe Biden for US intelligence to intensify efforts to determine the origins of Covid-19 has given fresh life to the theory that the virus may have leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. </p> <p>Biden said that US intelligence had “coalesced around two scenarios” — that the virus had either emerged naturally or was the result of a lab accident. It was the first time that Biden had given credence to the possibility that the virus had leaked from a lab — a notion widely slammed as a conspiracy theory when Donald Trump first made the claim. </p> <p>Today's FT View is that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e173e91a-9458-4a31-8c4e-5414f22a80dd\">understanding the origins of this pandemic is vital</a> to preventing another, but that determining the truth is not about apportioning blame. It would be far better for China finally to allow unfettered access to international investigators — unlikely as that may be — to hunt for the answer.</p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>OECD</strong> has said the global economy will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71beb926-2362-4085-a04e-5fa607e95aad\">return to pre-pandemic levels by 2022</a>, giving governments leeway to scale back emergency support and focus on investing.</p></li>  <li><p>Covid cases continue to rise in <strong>Argentina</strong>, with tough new measures <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8f8de3a-ed12-49fa-ba0e-f6de7d933d07\">risking further damage</a> to the economy.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Sweden </strong>will tomorrow become the last Nordic country to begin <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/c64b7e37-f00b-4e74-acf8-49c039c57698\">easing coronavirus restrictions</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Vietnam</strong> said it had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46290dfc-b0ad-4008-b93a-3edaf2a6ad3f\">detected a new variant</a> that&#xa0;combines features of&#xa0;the variants first identified in India and the UK.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Australia's</strong> <strong>Qantas Airways</strong> is touting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3d3c53f-ca79-49d3-abc2-d90445ff798a\">cheaper airfares and the prospect of unlimited flights</a> to customers who have taken Covid-19 jabs, as the country's businesses turn to creative means to counter vaccine hesitancy.</p></li> </ul> <p><a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/Bn_05I94SXxMfWJ34_Oxug~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRiiiIsP0R_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL25ld3NsZXR0ZXJzaWdudXAtY29yb25hdmlydXM_ZW1haWxJZD02MGE3OTU4MTJlYTM2YzAwMDQ4MjI4YWYmc2VnbWVudElkPTEzYjdlMzQxLWVkMDItMmI1My1lOGMwLWQ5Y2I1OWJlOGIzYlcIZmludGltZXNCCmClP52nYEs8IIFSFmplbm5pZmVyLmNyZWVyeUBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\"><em>Sign up</em></a><em>&#xa0;for our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/vGeTqXq8zydeDye-jHuWDQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRiiiIsP0R-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLWJ1c2luZXNzLXVwZGF0ZT9lbWFpbElkPTYwYTc5NTgxMmVhMzZjMDAwNDgyMjhhZiZzZWdtZW50SWQ9MTNiN2UzNDEtZWQwMi0yYjUzLWU4YzAtZDljYjU5YmU4YjNiVwhmaW50aW1lc0IKYKU_nadgSzwggVIWamVubmlmZXIuY3JlZXJ5QGZ0LmNvbVgEAAAAAA~~\"><em>Coronavirus Business Update</em></a><em>&#xa0;newsletter.</em></p> <h2>In the news</h2> <p><strong>Thrill-seeking traders send ‘meme stocks' soaring as crypto tumbles </strong>A new breed of day traders chasing thrills in the intense ups and downs of markets is asserting its dominance again, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11e59520-a504-4098-9fc1-e2fe66887e14\">sending shares in popular stocks surging</a> while cryptocurrency prices wilt.

US stocks are up about 11 per cent since the start of 2021, while those across European bourses have risen about 12 per cent, according to MSCI indices that track both markets in dollar terms. Equities in the Asia-Pacific region have climbed a more modest 4 per cent.
