  "title": "The Property Report:  Amazon Is Latest  Tech Firm to Set Up  An Office in Miami  ----  By Deborah Acosta",
  "text": "<p>   Amazon.com Inc. is establishing a new foothold in Miami, the latest sign that the city is succeeding in its efforts to become an East Coast tech hub. </p><p>   The e-commerce giant is renting nearly 9,000 square feet of office space at a WeWork Inc. building in Coral Gables, a city in Miami-Dade County, according to a person familiar with the matter. The space is occupied by employees in the Amazon Prime Video and Amazon Web Services teams, this person said. </p><p>   Some employees are transferring to Miami from Latin America. Amazon is in the process of hiring more than 60 employees to bring its total in Miami to about 160 jobs, this person said. This office represents its biggest corporate commitment in South Florida. </p><p>   While the Seattle company's presence in Miami is modest in scale by Amazon's standards, the company becomes the latest in a string of tech and financial companies that relocated to the Miami area or opened satellite offices. They were drawn by lower taxes and a more business-friendly environment than most states. The investment firms Blackstone Inc. and Starwood Capital Group, and Microsoft Corp. and Spotify Technology are among the high-profile firms to lease or build offices in or near the city within the past few years. </p><p>   Large tech-focused venture capital and private-equity firms like SoftBank, and Thoma Bravo migrated to the area. Most recently, Apollo Global Management leased 23,000 square feet of office space in Miami's 701 Brickell. </p><p>   About a third of the tenants who are looking for office space in the region are new to South Florida, or five times the 10-year average, said Grant Killingsworth, a Senior Vice President at CBRE representing office tenants in Miami-Dade County, Broward County and Palm Beach County. \"The majority of the tenant growth that's been happening through the Covid pandemic has been financial service firms and technology companies,\" he said. </p><p>   Miami was among 20 shortlisted cities when Amazon went in search of a second headquarters, the company has said, but it lost to Arlington, Va. In addition, Amazon created 18 tech hubs across North America, announcing further expansions in late 2021. </p><p>   Instead of signing a multiple-year lease, Amazon followed the lead of other tech companies in the city, like Kayak.com, and quietly rented its Miami space at a WeWork instead. Kayak rented space at the WeWork in Coral Gables. </p><p>   While office space is less expensive in Miami compared with New York City, the price rose in the past two years by as much as 30% in locations like the Brickell area, where some of the top-tier Class A buildings are asking between $70 to $100 a square foot, and up to $150 a square foot for certain spaces. </p><p></p>",
