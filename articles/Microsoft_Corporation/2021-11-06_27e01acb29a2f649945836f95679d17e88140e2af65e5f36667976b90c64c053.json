  "title": "New York Life's Pitch to Entrepreneurs: Sell Life Insurance; Company's CEO says its pivot to 'cultural markets' in the U.S., rather than overseas expansion, boosted sales and agent recruitment",
  "text": "<p>New York Life's focus stems from an unusual move soon after Ted Mathas, its current chairman and chief executive, took the CEO job in 2008: As rival life insurers were expanding internationally, Mr. Mathas pulled back in favor of building up the insurer's business in immigrant and other diverse communities within the U.S.</p><p>Mr. Mathas was convinced that overseas life-insurance markets in general posed more obstacles than opportunities, and that Chinese, South Asian, Korean, Vietnamese, Latino and Black communities within the U.S. had more promise than was generally recognized. New York Life calls them \"Cultural Markets,\" and a key to the insurer's approach is training professionals who are from those communities and know them well, Mr. Mathas said. These markets are \"the main part of our business today,\" he said, noting that they represent 56% of agency sales.</p><p>We talked to Mr. Mathas at the company's Manhattan headquarters about hiring trends during the pandemic, the insurer's diversity mission, and why entrepreneurs make great recruits. Edited excerpts follow:</p><p>WSJ: How has agent recruitment worked amid shutdowns and other pandemic restrictions?</p><p>Mr. Mathas: We recruited 3,700 agents in 2019 and we had 3,400 hires in 2020 despite the challenges presented by the pandemic. This year, we are on track to hire 3,900 agents.</p><p>Part of our success was investment in the years before the pandemic in a substantial technology platform. We already had the technology that would enable the whole chain of recruitment activity to be digital. It wasn't getting a tremendous amount of use before the pandemic.</p><p>And part of it was good old-fashioned agility. Necessity is the mother of invention. It took us a little time to pivot in 2020, but pretty quickly we got back on track. Recruiters started leaning into ways to meet people online such as using LinkedIn and Facebook.</p><p>WSJ: Job recruiters for many different industries say they are struggling to persuade young people to make sales a career. What is your experience?</p><p>Mr. Mathas: We look for people with the instincts to be entrepreneurs. Many businesses today are not necessarily looking for entrepreneurs to hire.</p><p>We focus primarily on individuals in their mid to late 30s. Many come from small-business backgrounds, some successful, some not. Real-life experience, business experience and professional relationships increase the prospect for success as an agent.</p><p>We help people to be in business for themselves, but not by themselves. Our agents have an office to work out of, they don't have a monthly rent obligation, they have people around who can help, mentor. We have rigorous training programs. There is flexibility in work hours.</p><p>People are re-evaluating what they want to do with their lives as a result of the pandemic, and they are looking for careers that have more purpose. I think the value proposition of being a New York Life agent is stronger than before the pandemic. People have learned the lesson: Unless you have a strong financial partner backing you in your career, you can be at risk.</p><p>WSJ: How did New York Life's focus on 'cultural markets' come about?</p><p>Mr. Mathas: In 1996, a group of New York Life agents working in South Asian and Chinese communities across the U.S. came to us, and said they were having success, but could do more if they had additional support. We started providing resources such as in-language materials, advertising spend, special workshops and conferences, and additional training and development support.</p><p>We had planted flags in India, China, South America, the Philippines and other markets. The idea was that these markets had population growth, and young families would be motivated to buy life insurance as their incomes grew. But these markets were different in terms of norms, laws, regulations. Other than demographics, this wasn't a great business for New York Life.</p><p>So in my first two years, we made a pivotal move: Exit the international life-insurance market but double-down on the internationalization of the U.S. population, where there is growth of young families and the need for life insurance.</p><p>WSJ: How do you find agents?</p><p>Mr. Mathas: Our recruiters identify people who are networkers in the community. These are people who can create local businesses and who have connections with parishes and other community centers.</p><p>WSJ: Life-insurance agents have famously high turnover, don't they?</p><p>Mr. Mathas: Fifteen to 20% of the people who start this business stay with it through the fourth year. But the appropriate comparison isn't to hiring an employee. It is to compare with success rates of small-business startups. We operate well above that rate because of the support we provide.</p><p>WSJ: Looking at your board of directors and senior ranks, minorities' representation isn't anywhere close to what it is in your agency force. The company has said, for example, that almost half of its agents last year identified as Black, Latino or Asian.</p><p>Mr. Mathas: Representation of minorities has gone from 9% to 23% in our Executive Officer ranks during my time as CEO. There is always room for progress and improvement.</p><p>The agent road map has not been the traditional path to a C-suite position. We think with the right focus, it can be.</p><p>Last year, I went on a listening tour of our African-American agents. One takeaway: We aren't well connected between the non-sales employee population at New York Life and our agent population. Most of the senior executives today at any insurance company do not typically start out as agents. Only one of our very senior leadership team [of 12] started out as an agent. [Mr. Mathas joined New York Life in 1995 as an officer in its asset-management department.]</p><p>The career path has traditionally been that you become an agent and maybe you become a recruiter or manager of other agents. So we have an opportunity given all that great talent.</p><p>WSJ: How can you make this happen?</p><p>Mr. Mathas: We have created a new role, Vice President for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for Agency, to focus on better nurturing our talent. Our agents want active career counseling and mentoring, and that is what we are leaning into more now in additional resources. Helping people of color network in a company can build the informal relationships that often spark new career opportunities.</p><p>Write to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.com</p><p>New York Life's Pitch to Entrepreneurs: Sell Life Insurance</p>",
