  "text": "<p>Political leaders around the world tend to hang on as long as humanly possible. Witness the UK's Boris Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/991caa43-ca90-4a4d-95a2-bfee9cc6e99d\">bowing out only</a> at the eleventh hour. Or China's Xi Jinping, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc8ab2bc-24fe-11e8-b27e-cc62a39d57a0\">changed the rules</a> in order to remain president for life. Coups help to ensure longevity. See Equatorial Guinea's Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo or Cambodian Hun Sen. </p> <p>Corporate bosses can be similarly reluctant to hand over the reins, particularly founder-CEOs. It took a string of scandals to eject Travis Kalanick from the driver's seat at Uber. Adam Neumann dug his heels in at WeWork. Bobby Kotick held on as improprieties engulfed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96801e40-a949-46f7-893f-4c1d8235f7db\">Activision Blizzard</a>, the gaming company he is selling to Microsoft.</p> <p>In the UK, however, turnover at the top is accelerating. Britain is poised for its fourth prime minister in seven years. Last year also set a record in corporate change.</p> <p>Under the right leader, longevity pays off. Simon Wolfson has spent 21 years as the boss of Next. He has turned the humdrum fashion retailer into an impressive investment. Total returns under his helm clock in at 1,245 per cent, roughly eight times that of the broader FTSE 100 index. That is despite a retail landscape scattered with casualties such as Top Shop and Debenhams.</p> <p>Also trumping the FTSE 100 with more than 20 years under their belt are Dechra Pharmaceuticals' Ian Page and Tim Steiner of Ocado. </p> <p>Political long tenures are less welcome. Britain's first prime minister, Sir Robert Walpole, lasted two decades; a record that has never been broken. He was described by satirist Jonathan Swift <a href=\"https://www.poetrynook.com/poem/character-sir-robert-walpole\">as</a>: “Achieving of nothing, still promising wonders/By dint of experience improving in Blunders”. </p> <p>But high churn rates, whether of nations or companies, tend to be more detrimental: just ask Italian and Japanese voters. </p> <p>Machiavellian manoeuvres are as rife in business as politics when it comes to dislodging unpopular top dogs. Italy's Generali responded to a leadership challenge by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2a12c23-b15b-444b-b3a7-7c6fcfa4f3ca\">firing</a> the presumptuous executive who investors hoped to install at the head of the insurance company. Leadership turnover may be on the rise, but the playbook remains remarkably static.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Boris Johnson/leadership: in business and politics, turnover is on the rise' FT.com 8 July.
