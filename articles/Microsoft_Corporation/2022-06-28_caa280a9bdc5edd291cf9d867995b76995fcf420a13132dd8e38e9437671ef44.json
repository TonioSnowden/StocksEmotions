  "text": "<p>Pinterest has recently shed users and suitors alike, losing nearly three-quarters of its market value over the past year in the process. A new leader won't automatically change much of that. Mr. Ready's LinkedIn profile lists his current role at Google as \"President of Commerce, Payments &amp; Next Billion Users.\" To turn things around at Pinterest, with its 433 million users, he will need all of those skill sets and more.</p><p>The company has long touted the fact that users come to its platform with shopping intent as a key competitive advantage over other social platforms. The fantasy is that Pinterest's users are on an \"inspiration to purchase journey\" and therefore will come to the platform not just to surf, but to spend, as its e-commerce initiatives grow.</p><p>Progress has been slow. As of the first quarter, Pinterest's average revenue per user was just $1.33 globally and under $5 even in the affluent U.S. and Canada, where over 80% of its revenue was derived. By comparison, Meta Platforms' Facebook generated an average of over $48 per user in that region in the same period.</p><p>Despite listing shopping as a key strategic initiative for its business in 2022, Pinterest only filled two paragraphs of an 18-page first quarter shareholder letter with progress on that vertical. Thus far, it has been especially vague in both description and detail, noting \"the number of Pinners engaging in shopping surfaces\" grew year over year. By how much and from what base is unclear.</p><p>Historically, Pinterest has had two primary issues. First, it has a narrow fan base. While the platform has been slowly building its base of younger Gen-Z users, it has traditionally appealed mostly to women and specifically to moms. Second, the company hasn't quite figured out how to make money from most users.</p><p>For a brief moment last fall, hope of an acquirer lightened the mood. The Wall Street Journal reported in October that PayPal was in early stage talks to acquire Pinterest, potentially creating a so-called \"super app\" that could bring a broader set of users to the social media platform and enable it to play a bigger role in the overall shopping ecosystem. The potential $40 billion-plus takeover was at a slight premium to Pinterest's market value at the time, but a far cry from its high of more than $55 billion early last year.</p><p>The experience might have impressed upon Pinterest that its best potential lies in someone else's hands. Mr. Ready's leadership experience, which also includes executive roles at PayPal, was the next best thing.</p><p>\"Bill's actually going to be a better CEO than I am for this next chapter,\" Mr. Silbermann told The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Investors should hope so.</p><p>Write to Laura Forman at laura.forman@wsj.com</p><p>Pinterest Pays a New Pal</p>",
