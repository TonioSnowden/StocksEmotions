  "text": "<p>As President Joe Biden keeps beating the drum for his Build Back Better package, analysts are saying parts of it still have a good chance of becoming reality even after last month's big setback.</p><p>Biden is slated to meet at 1 p.m. ET Wednesday with 10 private-sector executives who are expected to “highlight what they see as the key benefits of BBB for the American economy and American business,” a White House official said.</p><p>General Motors&#xa0;GM CEO Mary Barra,&#xa0;Ford F CEO Jim Farley, Microsoft&#xa0;MSFT&#xa0;President Brad Smith, Salesforce.com&#xa0;CRM CEO Marc Benioff and TIAA CEO Thasunda Brown Duckett are due to be among the participants in the meeting. Corning&#xa0;GLW CEO Wendell Weeks, HP&#xa0;HPQ CEO Enrique Lores, Cummins&#xa0;CMI CEO Tom Linebarger, Etsy&#xa0;ETSY CEO Josh Silverman and Siemens USA XE:SIESIEGY CEO Barbara Humpton are expected to take part as well.&#xa0;</p><p>See:Biden to meet Wednesday with CEOs of GM, HP, other companies as he tries again to push Build Back Better Act</p><p>The gathering at the White House comes a week after Biden said he expected his social-spending and climate package probably will get broken up in order to have parts of it passed by Congress. A key moderate Democratic senator, West Virginia's Joe Manchin, said in mid-December that he couldn't support the roughly $2 trillion package in its form at that time, ending top Democrats' push to get it passed in 2021.</p><p>A “BBB 2.0” is likely to emerge between Feb. 18 and Biden's State of the Union address on March 1, said Chris Krueger, a strategist and managing director at Cowen Washington Research Group, in a note on Wednesday. Feb. 18 is a key date in Washington, D.C., because that's when another funding measure needs to get enacted in order to avoid a partial government shutdown.</p><p>Related:Congress votes to keep government open through mid-February</p><p>Isaac Boltansky, a director of policy research and managing director at BTIG, has offered a similar timeline as Krueger.</p><p>“With the president's comments resetting the conversation, and the State of the Union address on March 1 expected to inject a degree of urgency, we believe Congressional Democrats will refocus on the social infrastructure package in February,” Boltansky said in a recent note.</p><p>“We expect the next few weeks on Capitol Hill to be dominated by the February 18 federal funding deadline,” he added.</p><p>The BTIG analyst also has offered the table below showing “what could conceivably be included in any final social infrastructure package.”</p><p>BTIGRelated:Here's what could make the cut for Biden's smaller Build Back Better Act</p><p>“We continue to see a better than 50% probability that some pieces of the BBB can become law,” said Benjamin Salisbury, director of research at Height Capital Markets, in a recent note.</p><p>“Our bias continues to be that progressives will eventually accept that they lack the votes to pass their full BBB wish-list and slash the agenda to meet the Manchin test. However, there is only the faintest of evidence for this capitulation a year into an exceedingly narrowly divided Congress,” the Height analyst added.</p>",
