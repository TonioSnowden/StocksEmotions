  "text": "<p>Facebook last month said it is working on AR glasses in tandem with sensor-packed wristbands that can detect finger movements, part of a broader push in researching the development of software and hardware to support the eyewear. As an interim step, the social-media giant this year is releasing eyewear with some tech capabilities in partnership with EssilorLuxottica SA's Ray-Ban brand.</p><p>Niantic Chief Executive John Hanke last week posted a tweet touting progress on its planned AR glasses, which it is making in partnership with chip maker Qualcomm Inc.</p><p>Other companies are guarding their plans. Apple is working on an AR headset for consumers, which analysts expect to hit the market as soon as next year, and has plans for AR glasses to follow. Analysts also say Snap Inc., which already sells camera-equipped sunglasses it calls Spectacles, is developing consumer AR glasses, and that Alphabet Inc.'s Google, which entered the space in 2013 with Google Glass before focusing on sales to business customers, is likely to try a consumer play again.</p><p>Apple, Snap and Google declined to comment.</p><p>The AR push reflects a belief among many technologists that face-borne computers could be a transformational class of products, enabling people to look up directions on a map, scroll through text messages or call up a recipe right before their eyes -- and without losing sight of the real world. Tech companies see AR glasses as an opportunity to drive consumers to spend more time in their ecosystems, where they can show ads, sell products and pursue other moneymaking opportunities.</p><p>\"To have a chance to potentially pioneer a new era is very exciting,\" said Andrew Bosworth, vice president at Facebook Reality Labs, a Facebook unit focused on augmented and virtual reality. \"This is a technology that doesn't live in my pocket; it lives on my face.\"</p><p>Virtual reality, or VR, is a technological cousin of AR that blocks out a user's view of the real world for a fully immersive experience.</p><p>Early consumer items will have limitations with technology and design, and they may not be able to easily accommodate people who rely on prescription eyewear. Stylish, all-day-wearable specs where digital content is projected through lenses are at least a year away, analysts say.</p><p>Augmented-reality headsets and glasses already on the market primarily target professional and industrial users rather than consumers. Microsoft Corp. has taken that approach with its HoloLens headsets, and last week announced a deal worth up to $21.9 billion to build and support custom versions of those AR gadgets for the U.S. Army. Magic Leap Inc., a startup that has been developing AR gear, shifted its focus toward business customers and last year replaced its CEO with a senior Microsoft executive.</p><p>With earlier models of glasses, consumers had complained about battery life as well as a lack of functions beyond what could be done on a smartphone or other tech gadgets. \"Joe and Jane consumer for the most part is comfortable with the tech they currently have,\" said Ramon Llamas, research director of augmented and virtual reality at International Data Corp.</p><p>Adoption of consumer-focused AR glasses is expected to be slow at the start, as analysts estimate early iterations to cost around the same as a new high-end smartphone, which can be at least $1,000.</p>",
