  "text": "<p>U.S. authorities and cybersecurity researchers foiled large parts of the plan, warning hospitals before the hackers' ransomware could be installed, but the hackers shrugged off the setback, according to a cache of data and documents leaked online in recent weeks.</p><p>The hacking enterprise, called the Trickbot Group by federal prosecutors, and its affiliates had already collected hundreds of millions of dollars by shutting down emergency rooms, city governments and public schools since 2018.</p><p>\"I find it all funny,\" wrote a Trickbot hacker who used the pseudonym \"target,\" in a message, after the plan was thwarted, to \"stern,\" the group's leader and paymaster.</p><p>This wide-open view of the inner workings of what is perhaps the world's biggest and most dangerous organized cybercrime group is a surprising consequence of the war in Ukraine. An anonymous researcher who had infiltrated the group's servers, and who identified himself as Ukrainian, posted the data on Twitter on Feb. 27. \"Ukraine will Rise!\" he then wrote in a March 2 tweet.</p><p>Security researchers and U.S. officials say the internal conversations amount to the most complete and candid public look yet at the operations of a criminal ransomware enterprise. U.S. authorities have been tracking the Trickbot group, but little was known publicly about its operations and internal deliberations before the cache of documents surfaced.</p><p>More than 200,000 messages exchanged by 450 Trickbot managers, staff and business partners since June 2020 reveal a well-organized criminal syndicate with possible connections to Russian intelligence agencies. They show an organizational resilience that allowed the group to rapidly recover from counterattacks by law enforcement, and grand ambitions to diversify and develop a cryptocurrency.</p><p>Life inside the group swings wildly between the dangerous and the mundane, with managers at once hatching extravagant plans, such as opening a pro-Russian espionage division, while also budgeting vacation time and smoothing over workforce conflicts.</p><p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine last month prompted the researcher to leak the information, according to two people who know him and can verify the work he did to capture Trickbot communications and pass them on to Western cybersecurity professionals. The researcher didn't respond to requests for comment sent to him via an intermediary.</p><p>U.S. law-enforcement officials haven't publicly verified the materials. Cybersecurity researchers and former security officials say the chat logs and other leaked documents appeared to be authentic. The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment.</p><p>The data include technical details that align with attacks using ransomware called Conti that Trickbot has previously claimed, as well as a breach previously attributed by security experts to another strain of ransomware developed by the group called Ryuk, according to an analysis of the data by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>A malware developer participating in the chats used a nickname previously identified in a federal indictmentas a coder for Trickbot. And gaps in the logs coincide with periods when the group's computer infrastructure was known to have been disrupted, according to security researchers and the security blogger Brian Krebs.</p><p>Ransomware locks up a target computer network's files until payment is made for their release. It has ballooned as a criminal enterprise in recent years. The U.S. Treasury Department said last fall that ransomware payments by American companies that were flagged by U.S. banks in the first six months of 2021 had nearly doubled to almost $600 million from the previous year's period.</p><p>President Biden began putting pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin last summer to take action to limit ransomware originating in Russia. Much of the world's cybercrime -- including ransomware -- originates there or in Eastern Europe, say security researchers and government officials.</p><p>Russia has denied U.S. accusations its state security apparatus is involved with cybercrime or tolerates it. Russia's embassy in Washington didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Officials say cybercriminal groups could target the U.S. as a form of retaliation for the West's support for Ukraine against Moscow's invasion. Gen. Paul Nakasone, the head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command, warned during a Senate hearing this month that Russia could become more likely to lash out with ransomware or other aggressive cyberattacks as the Ukraine conflict drags on.</p><p>On Monday, a Ukrainian internet service provider used by the country's military suffered a massive cyberattack, disrupting its services. Officials didn't say who was responsible.</p><p>Mr. Biden last week said evolving intelligence indicated the Kremlin was looking to target the U.S. with cyberattacks in response to economic sanctions.</p><p>U.S. officials are weighing whether to sanction the Trickbot group, according to sources familiar with the Treasury Department's thinking. Such a move would make it illegal for U.S. companies to pay its ransomware demands.</p><p>Trickbot is one of the most prolific and widely feared of the ransomware groups, and its Conti ransomware was the most used in 2021, according to cyber-threat researchers at Unit 42, at Palo Alto Networks. Trickbot runs an affiliate program that allows other criminals to sign up as partners and wield the group's ransomware, servers and ransom negotiators in exchange for payment.</p><p>The group's Conti ransomware strain was used in 16 targeted attacks on U.S. emergency responders last year, including hospitals and 911 call centers, according to the FBI. It was also used in attacks on Ireland's national healthcare system that forced doctors to cancel stroke and cancer treatments. The group's other ransomware code, Ryuk, has been used in attacks on at least 235 general hospitals and other healthcare facilities in the U.S. since 2018.</p><p>On Feb. 27, the anonymous researcher posted nearly two years of data -- private chat messages, financial information, source code and other technical details -- which he described as belonging to the operators of the Conti ransomware.</p><p>The leaks depict a highly professional and ruthless ransomware organization at the top of its game, said John Fokker, head of cyber investigations with the security firm Trellix. \"They don't care if they go after a hospital,\" he said. \"It's all about making money.\"</p><p>The anonymous source of the leak is one of a handful of cybersecurity analysts who have been secretly infiltrating Trickbot's electronic infrastructure, according to Alex Holden, a security analyst whose company, Hold Security, monitors Eastern European cybercrime and Trickbot. The researchers have recorded private chats undetected and undermined some of the group's plans.</p><p>In September 2020, U.S. officials at U.S. Cyber Command and elsewhere were successful in freeing thousands of computers from the hackers' control, according to current and former officials and others familiar with the operation. The network of machines had been infected for the purpose of conducting cyberattacks, they said.</p><p>At around the same time, Microsoft Corp. worked with a world-wide coalition of technology companies to block servers at eight U.S. hosting companies that Trickbot rented to run the back-end of its operations.</p><p>The chat messages show flashes of frustration with the counterattack. \"[T]hese offline bots will demoralize everyone,\" one Trickbot manager complained, referring to the hacked PCs that abruptly stopped accepting orders from the group.</p><p>The group began rebuilding its network of compromised computers immediately, and within weeks had returned to full strength and started a dangerous revenge plot, the messages show. The hackers began methodically penetrating U.S. hospitals, intent on simultaneously crippling hundreds of them as they struggled with rising Covid infections.</p><p>Cybersecurity researchers who had been tracking the group warned U.S. authorities, and the Department of Homeland Security warned hospitals. Cybersecurity experts worked to minimize the damage. \"I don't think I've ever been as scared as I was that week,\" said Joshua Corman, former chief strategist with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's Covid Task Force, a Homeland Security group set up to protect the healthcare sector during the pandemic.</p><p>After the hospital attack plan was countered, the messages show Trickbot managers searching for how their plans leaked. \"Checked everything back and forth, there's nothing on the PC, no traffic leaks,\" one of the group reported to \"stern.\"</p><p>Though the coordinated hospital attacks didn't work out, funds were flowing in from desperate victims in other corporate sectors. The group's Conti ransomware business received payments of $70 million in 2020 and more than $200 million in 2021, according to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. As of early March, it had taken in $13.5 million, Chainalysis said.</p><p>The chats offer a number of references to possible connections between the Trickbot gang and Russian security officials.</p><p>\"We can see conversations that are very suggestive that at least a small portion of these threat actors might have some sort of relationship with Russian intelligence or the Russian government apparatus,\" where the hackers may work to obtain intelligence for the government, said Kimberly Goody, director of cybercrime analysis with the security firm Mandiant.</p><p>In October, a member called \"kagas\" passed along word of a newly reopened investigation in Russia into the group spurred by a request from U.S. officials.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
