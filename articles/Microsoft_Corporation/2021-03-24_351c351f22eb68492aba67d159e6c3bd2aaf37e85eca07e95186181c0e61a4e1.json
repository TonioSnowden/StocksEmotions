  "title": "Store Closings Weigh on GameStop",
  "text": "<p>GameStop has been working to transform its decadesold bricks-and-mortar business to become more technology-centric, aiming to avoid a fate similar to retailers like Blockbuster and Borders. The company has been weathering a steep decline in foot traffic since the start of the pandemic and, more recently, shortages in supply of hot items like Sony Corp . and Microsoft Corp .'s next-generation consoles.</p><p>It has also grappled with long-term industry changes, including people increasingly downloading games over the internet, software developers releasing more free-to-play games and people accessing games through subscription services such as Microsoft 's Xbox Game Pass.</p><p>After a difficult year Chief Executive George Sherman said GameStop was working to become a \"customer-obsessed tech company that delights gamers.\" He said the retailer plans to expand its product offerings in areas such as gaming computers, gaming TVs and mobile gaming, while reducing its dependence on the console-gaming market and improving customer service and warehouse management.</p><p>\"We expect to accelerate these and other elements of our transformation while continuing to focus on allowing the company to build upon its progress and capitalize on the emerging console cycle,\" said Mr. Sherman.</p><p>In the latest quarter though, GameStop fell short of Wall Street forecasts on revenue and profit and declined to give financial guidance for the current year. Shares fell more than 10% in after-hours trading. The stock closed Tuesday down 7% to $181.75.</p><p>The company's fourth-quarter profit nearly quadrupled from a year ago to $80.5 million, or $1.19 a share, helped by an income-tax benefit. Sales in the quarter fell 3% to $2.12 billion, though it noted it closed hundreds of stores over the past year and that ecommerce accounted for more than a third of its total business.</p><p>GameStop 's shares have had a roller-coaster run since the start of the year, fueled by individual investors who embraced companies championed in online forums like WallStreetBets. The January run-up in GameStop 's share price led to losses among hedge funds and other investors who placed heavy bets against the company's stock performance. But the support was also driven by people who believe that the recent addition of Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen to the GameStop board could lead to a much-needed business overhaul.</p><p>Mr. Cohen and two other former Chewy executives joined the retailer's board in January.</p>",
