  "title": "EU to Probe Microsoft's $75 Billion Deal for Activision Blizzard More Deeply; Watchdog group says it is concerned the acquisition could reduce competition in the global videogaming industry",
  "text": "<p>The European Commission, which opened its initial, formal probe of the deal in late September, said it is concerned that the deal may reduce competition in the markets for console and personal computer distribution, videogames and PC operating systems. It said it was concerned that Microsoft may block access to Activision Blizzard games to other game distributors, especially the publisher's most successful franchises such as Call of Duty.</p><p>\"We must ensure that opportunities remain for future and existing distributors of PC and console videogames, as well as for rival suppliers of PC operating systems,\" the Commission said. \"The point is to ensure that the gaming ecosystem remains vibrant to the benefit of users in a sector that is evolving at a fast pace.\"</p><p>The shift to an in-depth probe, also known as a phase-two investigation, signals that the regulator is concerned the deal could restrict competition within the bloc. Phase-two reviews typically involve more extensive information gathering and detailed requests for information from competitors.</p><p>The Commission said it has 90 working days, until March 23, to make a decision.</p><p>A spokesman for Microsoft said the company is continuing to work with the Commission on potential next steps and to address any valid marketplace concerns. \"We've said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation,\" he said. \"We want people to have more access to games, not less.\"</p><p>Sony Group Corp. didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The maker of PlayStation consoles and Microsoft's main videogaming rival has previously raised concerns about its ability to offer its customers access to popular Activision games if the deal goes through.</p><p>The deal for Activision, which would be Microsoft's biggest-ever acquisition, is also being reviewed in the U.S. by the Federal Trade Commission and in the U.K. by the Competition and Markets Authority. The U.K. regulator said in September that it was escalating its investigation of the deal after Microsoft told the regulator it wasn't offering concessions that might have led to a faster approval.</p><p>Competition lawyers have said that regulators in the U.K., the U.S. and the EU are the most likely to intervene in the deal.</p><p>Microsoft makes Xbox videogame consoles and develops and publishes its own games. The software giant has been a leader in the cloud-gaming market through its Game Pass subscription service. Sony offers cloud gaming through its PlayStation Plus subscription. Activision, in addition to Call of Duty, one of the world's bestselling game series, is known for making other hits such as World of Warcraft and Candy Crush Saga.</p><p>Microsoft announced the agreement to buy Activision in January and has said it expects it to close by June of 2023.</p><p>Buying Activision would significantly increase Microsoft's videogame revenue. Activision's sales totaled $8.8 billion in 2021. Microsoft reported $16.23 billion in videogame revenue for the fiscal year through June, accounting for about 8% of its total revenue.</p><p>After its in-depth investigation, the EU's antitrust agency can unconditionally clear the merger, allow it to move forward with conditions, or prohibit the deal entirely.</p><p>EU to Probe Microsoft's $75 Billion Deal for Activision Blizzard More Deeply</p>",
