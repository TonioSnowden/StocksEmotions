  "text": "<p>FirstGroup chief executive Matthew Gregory announced he will step down in September, a day after the transport group's biggest shareholder demanded his resignation over the sale of its US divisions.</p> <p>New York-based Coast Capital, which owns a roughly 15 per cent stake in FirstGroup, had called for Gregory and two other board members to resign over the $4.5bn disposal of its First Transit and First Student divisions to Scandinavian group EQT. Gregory, who became chief executive in 2018, should “be replaced by a CEO of industry competency, as soon as possible,” the activist investor said.</p> <p>David Martin, Firstgroup's non-executive chair, will become interim executive chair while the company seeks a new CEO.</p> <p>News of the departure came as FirstGroup posted a £224.3m statutory operating profit in the year ended March, well above the £155m consensus of analysts' estimates. The company, which operates Great Western Railways, said it expects volumes to recover to between 80 per cent to 90 per cent of pre-pandemic levels during the first year after social distancing restrictions end.</p> <p><em>Do you think Gregory should have quit? We'd love to hear your comments and feedback. Email us at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"mailto:citybulletin@ft.com\"><em>citybulletin@ft.com</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Reckitt Benckiser</strong>'s first-half results missed analysts' estimates as commodity costs picked up in its second quarter. Operating profit margins weakened 2.9 percentage points in the first half of the year to 21.6 per cent, with the maker of Dettol disinfectants and Cillit Bang bleach posting a £1.94bn statutory pre-tax loss having booked a £3bn charge related to the agreed sale last month of its baby formula interests in China. Like-for-like sales weakened 1 per cent in the three months to June as demand for surface cleaning products started to cool. </p> <p>Chemicals maker <strong>Croda</strong> said 2021 adjusted pre-tax profit will be significantly ahead of expectations. Half-year results from Croda showed adjusted pre-tax profit of £229.5m, up 50.5 per cent, as sales rebounded to well above 2019 levels. </p> <p>Russian gold miner <strong>Polymetal</strong> retained full-year targets after posting a 6 per cent year-on-year decline in second-quarter production. Higher metals prices meant its quarterly revenue rose 6 per cent to $681m.</p> <p>Maiden full-year results from <strong>Moonpig</strong>, the greetings card retailer, delivered a more than doubling of underlying profit. Adjusted ebitda of £368.2m was up 113 per cent year on year and at the top end of guidance given in February, with revenue up 113 per cent to £368.2m on new customer acquisition and higher purchase frequency. For the current financial year ending April 2022, Moonpig targeted revenue of between £250m and £260m as trading normalises on the easing of lockdown restrictions.</p> <p><strong>Playtech</strong>, the gambling software provider, said first-half trading has remained in line with expectations.</p> <p><strong>Reach</strong>, the Daily Mirror and Daily Express publisher, said recent trading has been ahead of expectations on improving print circulation and digital revenue. For the first half the publisher posted an adjusted pre-tax operating profit of £68.9m, up 25.5 per cent. </p> <p><strong>Virgin Money</strong> said it expects net interest margin for the year to be modestly above its previous guidance of 1.6 percentage points. The bank said in a third-quarter update that customer loans totalled £72.5bn in the three months to June, up 0.4 per cent year on year. Mortgages and personal loans were up 0.7 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively, while business loans shrunk and government pandemic lending schemes wound down.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Aon and Willis Towers Watson</strong> have&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6471af0-764d-49e7-87a0-dd2a2c110fd9\">abandoned a $30bn tie-up</a>&#xa0;that would have created the world's biggest insurance broker after the US government&#xa0;sued&#xa0;to block the merger. Aon's chief executive Greg Case said the companies had reached an “impasse” with the US justice department.</p> <p><strong>US Treasury real yields</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71d6661d-7a62-4a5f-959b-4cb2f1e94d68?emailId=60ff8c6109a782000472d90a&amp;segmentId=22011ee7-896a-8c4c-22a0-7603348b7f22\">hit record lows</a>, falling further below zero as growing anxiety over the outlook for economic growth added fuel to a recent rally in bond markets.</p> <p><strong>Tesla</strong> overcame severe supply chain problems in the latest quarter,&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cbf718d8-3205-427d-b6bf-006cefff165e\">boosting its profit margins</a>&#xa0;and pushing its revenue above Wall Street expectations.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>The pandemic is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3250c4e8-1746-4286-979c-aa1739742366\">an opportunity</a> to rethink the byzantine airport landing slots system to increase competition, and align with policy objectives around connectivity or decarbonisation.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Knee</strong> <br>Characterising <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a14b212-6eec-4b30-8ace-bb7dc1eb4090\">pedestrian businesses as “platforms”</a> has become the go-to move to goose valuation multiples or just attract interest. Companies such as Microsoft, Amazon and Apple are extraordinary platform businesses that derive their core value from the connections they facilitate. But this does not mean that these businesses are great because of their platform status or that all, or even most, platform businesses exhibit superior economics. </p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'FirstGroup chief executive bows to investor pressure and resigns' FT.com 27 July.
