  "text": "<p>The private-investing world, already flush with cash, is angling for trillions more—this time, from individual investors.</p><p>The influx may mean big changes not only for investors, but for the public stock market.</p><p>The private markets are expected to grow to about $12.5 trillion in 2025 from $7.2 trillion in 2020, according to Morgan Stanley. Buyouts, growth equity and venture capital account for about 69% of the industry, the investment bank said. Private-equity firms, whose funds have long been a core holding for pensions and other institutions, are racing to develop new products that will appeal to wealthy individuals and market them to the financial advisers who manage their money.</p><p>These funds' efforts may accelerate another trend that's been under way for two decades, industry executives say. The number of public U.S. companies, already well below its late-1990s peak, and industry executives and market historians expect them to decrease further as ample access to private capital gives even multibillion-dollar firms reason to put off going public. And private-equity firms will continue to hunt in the public markets for buyout candidates.</p><p>\"The decline in public companies and the increase in participation in private markets are related,\" says Tony Tutrone, global head of Neuberger Berman's NB Alternatives business, which focuses on private-market investments.</p><p>Spiraling inflation, rising interest rates and recession fears have hammered stocks this year, closing the window to most new public offerings. But even if market conditions turn more welcoming for IPOs in coming years, many private companies may hold off the decision for longer, industry executives say.</p><p>It's not a given that individuals will embrace private markets the way pensions and other institutions have. Many could balk at the higher fees and lack of liquidity that often accompany private investments. Unlike mutual funds and ETFs, private funds impose limits on when investors can withdraw their money—even if future offerings aimed at individuals are less restrictive than the funds traditionally sold to pensions and other institutions.</p><p>Here's what financial experts say is driving the public-private market shift, and how it could play out in coming years.</p><p>Where Did the Small-Cap Stocks Go?</p><p>One reason many investors find private equity so alluring: It gives them the chance to invest in the kinds of companies that have been slowly disappearing from the public market—small-cap stocks with large-cap potential.</p><p>The number of public U.S. companies fell sharply in the years after the dot-com bubble burst, dropping to 4,995 in 2013 from 8,872 in 1997, according to the Center for Research in Security Prices LLC. The number has since hovered around 5,000, as mergers and acquisitions have more or less offset new offerings.</p><p>A decadelong merger boom has made it far more likely that promising startups end up subsumed into titans like Microsoft Corp. or Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. before they go public. And those that remain independent are staying private longer, delaying their IPOs until they can debut as large-cap companies—a trend some expect to intensify in the future. There are more than 1,100 \"unicorns,\" or privately held companies valued at more than $1 billion, as of June, according to CB Insights.</p><p>Being public also brings more scrutiny, and requires more disclosures on company results, Mr. Tutrone notes.</p><p>Companies once went public to fuel core parts of their operations or growth plans, said Tim Koller, a partner with McKinsey &amp; Co. \"Now it's more about creating liquidity, or the opportunity to share that with employees,\" he said.</p><p>Last year, the number of listed U.S. companies ticked up to 5,600, CRSP said, as low interest rates helped lift the value of growth companies, both public and private, persuading some startups to go public. Others did so through special-purpose acquisition companies, or blank-check entities that tap the public markets with a stated intent to merge with a private company.</p><p>But with interest rates rising, stocks in a bear market and SPACs facing a regulatory crackdown, the increase in new public companies isn't expected to last. By June the number had dropped back down to 5,509, CRSP said.</p><p>\"It's fair to expect the number of public firms is probably going to fall, but at a slow pace,\" says René Stulz, chair of the banking and monetary economics department at The Ohio State University's business school. </p><p>PHOTO: Shawn Michael Jones for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>A Top-Heavy Market</p><p>The big public companies are getting bigger, too. The 10 largest companies in the S&amp;P 500 Index—a list that includes Apple Inc., Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta—now account for about 30% of the benchmark's market capitalization.</p><p>By last year, the market-capitalization dividing line between the Russell 1000 Index, a benchmark that tracks the largest 1,000 public companies, and the Russell 2000, which includes the next 2,000 biggest, stood at $5.2 billion. That's more than four times what it was in 2009, immediately following the financial crisis.</p><p>What's more, companies in the Russell 2000 now account for less than 10% of the stock market's total value. \"And half of those stocks are micro-caps,\" said Mark Makepeace, chief executive of Wilshire and the founder of FTSE Russell, which launched the Russell indexes. \"Profitability is much lower, and they're not what managers want to hold.\"</p><p>The shift has made it harder for stock pickers to diversify their portfolios, leading some to turn to private investments.</p><p>\"If our job is to find and invest in the best companies, but you have that large a decline in the small- and mid-size category that's so important to us, it makes a lot of sense to look for those companies that could be public but aren't,\" said David DiPietro, head of private equity at T. Rowe Price Group Inc., the 85-year-old mutual-fund giant.</p><p>Private Equity's New Frontier</p><p>Investment firms' traditional clients, including pension plans and sovereign-wealth funds, still allocate a big chunk of their assets to private markets. But many are nearing their limits. The potential slowdown has spurred private-equity firms, the biggest of which are now publicly traded companies themselves, to search for a new growth frontier. Individual investors–whose access to private equity and debt has until now been limited to the very wealthy–fit the bill.</p><p>Blackstone Inc., an industry heavyweight, has launched private real-estate and debt funds aimed at individuals. And earlier this year, the firm sought permission from regulators to start a new fund that gives individuals access to leveraged buyouts. The filing was in May and there haven't been any major developments since.</p><p>These funds, and others like them, offer tweaks that make them more palatable to affluent individuals than the products traditionally sold to institutional investors and the ultra rich, including lower fees and the ability to make more frequent withdrawals.</p><p>The prospect comes with some concerns. An influx of new money into private investments may make it more difficult for many private-equity managers to outperform the public market as they have in past years. As more asset managers seek to build a presence in private markets, some will invariably chase some of the same deals—driving up purchase prices and lowering their ultimate returns.</p><p>\"This is a continuing cycle we go through, where a big push into an asset class overwhelms attractive investments and then, as a result, aggregate returns aren't that great,\" Mr. Koller of McKinsey &amp; Co. says. </p><p>PHOTO: Shawn Michael Jones for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>An Opaque Economy</p><p>Private companies aren't required to disclose as much information about their operations as those listed publicly, making a bigger slice of the economy less transparent. And some worry the growth could eventually leave the biggest private-equity firms in control of an ever-larger portion of the market.</p><p>The growth in private equity is also likely to reduce the amount of information available to the public. While investors in private funds do get regular updates on how the holdings perform, those reports may not be as robust.</p><p>\"That's a benefit to companies in terms of developing strategies and staying under the radar,\" Mr. Stulz says. \"If you have to disclose to investors, you have to disclose to competitors.\" But he adds, \"If more and more firms are disclosing relatively little compared to public firms, it means you don't have a view of the economy that you would otherwise have.\"</p><p>Winners Take Most?</p><p>None of this spells doom for the markets. But these changes could make it tougher for investors to diversify their portfolios. In the future, an even larger chunk of the investing world may be tied up in two groups of behemoths: The mega-cap stocks, owned increasingly by a handful of massive index-fund managers; and the largest private-equity firms, expected to benefit disproportionately from their market's growth.</p><p>\"Private equity is fairly concentrated, too,\" says Ludovic Phalippou, a professor of financial economics at Oxford University. \"You could have a world where 20-30 firms control everything.\"</p><p>Mr. Koller disagrees, noting that large companies rarely maintain their dominance over time. Technology evolves and customer needs change. The conglomerates so popular with stock investors in the 1970s are all gone, he says, and few if any of the biggest tech companies in 1990 still rank among the top 30 today.</p><p>\"The economy and the markets are dynamic, and rarely do trends continue forever,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Justin Baer at justin.baer@wsj.com</p><p>What Private Equity's Rise Means for Your Stock Investments</p>",
