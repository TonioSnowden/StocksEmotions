  "text": "<p>US stock markets slipped back from their record high on Wednesday, as strong earnings reports from technology giants were not enough to offset weakness in the rest of the market.</p> <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index fell 0.5 per cent from Tuesday's<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aca67467-fd85-4aad-893f-96fb8ba59c97\"> record close</a>, with tech groups and consumer stocks including Amazon the only sectors that made gains. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was flat.</p> <p>Energy stocks were the biggest drivers of the declines as oil prices retreated from their recent highs.</p> <p>Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet were bright spots, jumping 4 per cent and 5 per cent respectively after they <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/273aeecb-57a8-40f8-a2ba-8a21a635b289\">smashed analyst forecasts</a> with third-quarter results released after the closing bell on Tuesday evening. </p> <p>The weak showing followed a similarly disappointing day for European bourses. The European Stoxx 600 index closed 0.4 per cent lower. London's FTSE 100 was down 0.3 per cent after chancellor Rishi Sunak delivered the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22c1bb77-5660-42fa-9c33-cfea8163ca0f\">UK's Budget</a>, outlining the state of the country's public finances and Westminster's spending plans. </p> <p>Sunak said inflation was expected to average 4 per cent over the next year, while the Office for Budget Responsibility has upgraded its economic growth expectations from 4 per cent to 6.5 per cent for 2021. </p> <p>News that alcohol duty would be simplified, aligning higher rates with stronger drinks, along with a new “draught relief” scheme, lifted British pub stocks to a small rally on Wednesday. Shares in JD Wetherspoon gained 5 per cent.</p> <p>In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed the day down 1.6 per cent.</p> <p>In government bond markets, UK 10-year gilts rallied by the most since March last year — the early days of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus\">coronavirus pandemic</a> — after the Debt Management Office said that total planned gilt sales for the 2021-22 fiscal year were down £57.8bn relative to its April estimate, taking them to £198.4bn. The reduction came after official estimates showed that stronger-than-expected economic growth will boost government receipts, lowering spending needs. </p> <p>The yield on the UK 10-year government bond dropped 0.13 percentage points to 0.98 per cent. Lower bond yields reflect higher prices.</p> <p>The rally rippled into other markets, with the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note dropping 0.07 percentage points to 1.54 per cent.</p> <p>Elsewhere in North America, the Bank of Canada jolted markets by abruptly ending its bond-buying programme and signalling that it could raise interest rates by the middle of next year, becoming the latest central bank to respond to stubbornly high inflation with a hawkish policy shift.</p> <p>Canadian two-year government bond yields — which are sensitive to interest rate expectations — surged by 0.21 percentage points to 1.07 per cent. The prospect of higher&#xa0;rates helped the Canadian dollar gain 0.3 per cent against the US dollar to trade at C$1.24.</p> <p>Investors had expected the BoC to halve the pace of its asset purchases to C$1bn (about $811m) a week rather than the sudden stop, said HSBC currency strategist Dominic Bunning.</p> <p>Traders are primed for multiple central bank meetings in the coming days against a backdrop of high inflation, persistent concerns about economic growth and expectations of imminent monetary policy tightening as well as the tapering of pandemic-era bond-buying programmes.</p> <p>The European Central Bank is set to meet on Thursday this week, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday next week and the Bank of England a day later. </p><p>Source: Harriet Clarfelt and Tommy Stubbington in London and Nicholas Megaw in New York 2021 'Energy stocks lead Wall Street fall from record highs ' FT.com 27 October.
