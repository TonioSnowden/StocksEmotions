  "text": "<h2>This week's problem</h2> <p>I am nearing 15 years in mid-level communications and international affairs in the civil service and the UN. I want to move into a more commercial environment. Which industries would consider my experience favourably and what is the best way to approach a job search, considering my network does not extend into the private sector? <strong>Male, 40s</strong></p> <h2>Jonathan's answer</h2> <p>A role in the civil service and UN, covering international affairs, has probably given you immediate experiences in some of the most significant and challenging topics that affect nations and whole industries. In your career, you will have learnt to work with a very diverse range of people, representing not just themselves, but their governments or ministerial departments. You have probably worked across multiple languages and cultures, with elected and appointed officials, and on both very short and very long timescales.</p> <p>It will be useful to identify what is driving your yearning for a more commercial environment. The principle (and maybe sole) purpose of a commercial organisation is to make a profit and the whole establishment should be focused on that one aim. This is probably the main difference with your current and previous employers, who will have many different and perhaps conflicting aims, not always tangible or quantifiable. However, all organisations will have had to work within a budget, even if not to make a profit.</p> <p>Charities, governments or commercial organisations are more similar than different: they set a strategy to use money to engage people to deliver products and services to customers. The difference for you will be that unlike governments or the UN, commercial companies have to achieve their financial profit on much shorter timescales, or they disappear.</p> <p>If you truly seek this riskier path, perhaps for higher reward or seeing faster results, then consider who would value your skills and experience. A stepping stone role within international affairs and communications in a large multinational may be a good first step into the commercial world; you'd be able to learn a new business culture and come to understand what makes a commercial company tick. University, social media, and conferences could give you some good contacts to start your information gathering.</p> <p>It may not be one or the other; good financial management should be sought after by NGOs and government departments — there may be some beacons of excellence that you could target — or even to improve the performance of your current employer.&#xa0;</p> <p>If you feel you don't have all the skills, then consider taking an MBA or masters in a public policy programme; you might even be able to do that part-time, and your employer may help fund it so as to retain you. One benefit of such a course will be that you build your network through classmates, alumni, and course teachers, uncovering more possible opportunities for your career.</p> <h2>Readers' advice</h2> <p>Which industries do you regulate, make policy for, or work with? Apply to that industry. <strong>Friendly Commenter</strong></p> <p>I work for a large multinational and many of our government affairs professionals began in the public sector. I'd make good use of LinkedIn for vacancies/job search and talk to some PR headhunters. <strong>nogimachi</strong></p> <p><strong>Jonathan Black is director of the Careers Service at the University of Oxford.
