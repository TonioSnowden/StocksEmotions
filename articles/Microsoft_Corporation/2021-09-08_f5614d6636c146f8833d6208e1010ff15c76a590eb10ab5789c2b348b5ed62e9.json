  "title": "Citrix Activist Could Clean Up on Messy Cloud Transition; Company's disastrous earnings report brings Elliott Management back as software M&A remains strong",
  "text": "<p>But not all was well under the hood. Citrix, which has been in business since 1989, is working to transition more of its business to a subscription-based cloud model. It can be a painful shift, as accounting rules for subscription businesses often result in a near-term hit, as revenue has to be recognized over the life of the contract. Other traditional software vendors have managed it rather smoothly, Microsoft and Adobe being prime examples. Citrix, however, has struggled greatly, with reported sales missing Wall Street's forecasts over the last two quarters. Prior to The Wall Street Journal's report late Tuesday of Elliott's latest involvement, Citrix shares were down 20% for the year. The S&amp;P 500 Software &amp; Services Group was up 22% in the same time.</p><p>The company's second-quarter report in late July made clear that Elliott won't have an easy task in trying to repeat its feat with Citrix. In what Tyler Radke of Citi called a \"whiff for the ages,\" Citrix cited a host of sales-related issues, including \"unexpected sales process complexity.\" The company projected third-quarter revenue about 9% short of analysts's estimates and reduced its full-year forecast. Citrix shares slid 13% following that report, and Wall Street remains dubious. Only 38% of covering brokers rate Citrix shares as a buy compared with 50% a year ago.</p><p>The selloff has produced one of the cheapest stocks in the software sector; Citrix shares were fetching less than 4 times forward sales before Wednesdayâ€”less than half the average multiple for the S&amp;P software group. That could attract strategic buyers as well as private-equity players that have been hot on software of late. And Mark Moerdler of Bernstein noted in a report in mid-August that Citrix isn't under \"meaningful pressure\" from larger competitors such as Microsoft due to its focus on the high end of the enterprise market. But Citrix will still need to start closing more deals, or find one for itself.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Citrix Activist Could Clean Up on Messy Cloud Transition</p>",
