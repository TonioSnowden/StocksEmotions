  "text": "<p>The Santa Monica, Calif.-based company posted $280 million in net income for the three months ended June 30, down from $876 million in the same period a year earlier. Analysts polled by FactSet expected $410.6 million.</p><p>Stripped of certain items such as expenses related to share-based compensation, adjusted earnings were 48 cents a share, down from $1.20 a share in the year-ago period, matching analysts' expectations.</p><p>A deal between Microsoft and Activision would continue the software company's ascent as a powerhouse in business computing and a rising giant in videogames under Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella's leadership. Microsoft rushed into a deal after The Wall Street Journal reported that Activision CEO Bobby Kotick knew about allegations of employee misconduct at the company but didn't brief the board.</p><p>Activision has said the Journal's reporting created a misleading picture of the company. Mr. Kotick has said he is transparent with his board, which issued a statement supporting him.</p><p>Mr. Kotick, who is expected to leave after the acquisition is complete, could walk away with as much as $520 million. The deal is expected to close in mid-2023.</p><p>Another major development at Activision has taken place in recent months: In May, a small number of workers at one of Activision's studios voted in favor of unionizing with the Communications Workers of America, a first for a major U.S. videogame publisher.</p><p>A sense of how the broader videogame market is faring will become clearer on Tuesday with results from the latest quarter from competitor Electronic Arts Inc.</p><p>Write to Denny Jacob at denny.jacob@wsj.com</p><p>Activision Blizzard Profit Slumps as Sales Shrink</p>",
