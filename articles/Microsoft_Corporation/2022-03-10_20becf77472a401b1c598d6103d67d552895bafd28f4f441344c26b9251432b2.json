  "text": "<p>Xavier Rolet, the former head of the London Stock Exchange, has stepped down as chair of Russian fertiliser group PhosAgro, after its chief executive was added to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b45ec05a-7f2b-491f-806e-4e5c0082cdb6\">EU's sanctions list</a> of businessmen close to the Kremlin.</p> <p>The 62-year-old, who ran the LSE for almost a decade, joins a number of UK business people who are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27baeaf0-e568-456f-aa3d-0c266f1341f9\">resigning</a> from companies with close Russian ties. Greg Barker, a former Conservative minister, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df2d0c59-da76-4bcd-8c07-5bd797a509cc\">stepped down</a> as chair of EN+ this week.</p> <p>Under Rolet, the LSE grew into one of the world's largest exchanges by market capitalisation. While he was leading the exchange, London became the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/636a8cd4-13ac-11e2-9cc7-00144feabdc0\">go-to market</a> for Russian companies to raise international money. PhosAgro floated on the LSE in 2011 in a $540mn initial public offering.</p> <p>Rolet was appointed chair of PhosAgro in 2018 after leaving the LSE in 2017 under pressure from the board to resolve a governance crisis. He was awarded the Order of Friendship of the Russian Federation in 2017.</p> <p>In defence of Russian companies facing sanctions, he <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/xavier-r-rolet-58534424_ive-already-shared-my-views-publicly-about-activity-6907128722093408257-A0hz/\">wrote</a> on LinkedIn this week that “the logic of using the weight of sanctions, boycotts and public pressure to punish LSE-listed companies for failures of policy and negotiation frankly eludes me”.</p> <p>PhosAgro announced that Andrey Guryev, its chief executive, was also resigning. As the head of Europe's largest producer of phosphate-based fertilisers, the oligarch benefited from the Russian government's decisions, said the EU, as it announced sanctions on individuals this week.</p> <p>The company was “largely connected with the Russian government and the revenue it generates is therefore an important source of revenue for the Russian government”, the EU added.</p> <p>Guryev was among the 14 business people with close links to the Kremlin that the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2022:080:FULL&amp;from=EN\">EU added</a> to its sanctions list on Wednesday in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The new measures target executives at some of Russia's largest companies outside of the banking, oil and gas industries, including the billionaire owners of large coal and fertiliser producers.</p> <p>On Thursday, the UK government imposed sanctions on Russian oligarchs, including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66540723-08fa-439b-acaa-e74265aa0dce\">Roman Abramovich</a>, the owner of Chelsea football club, Oleg Deripaska, the founder of London-listed metals group EN+, and Igor Sechin, chief executive of Rosneft.</p><p>Source: Emiko Terazono 2022 'Xavier Rolet resigns from Russian fertiliser group hit by sanctions' FT.com 10 March.
