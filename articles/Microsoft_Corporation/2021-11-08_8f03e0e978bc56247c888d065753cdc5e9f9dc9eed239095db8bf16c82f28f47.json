  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>Today was a red letter day for the global travel industry as transatlantic air routes for vaccinated passengers reopened between the US and 33 countries, including the UK and most of Europe, after 18 months of disruption.</p> <p>For an industry that has lost $6tn during the pandemic, the reopening of the most lucrative routes in the world — in normal times worth $9bn a year to US and UK carriers — is a big step forward, as our latest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/474516a6-6cbf-4d41-9e0b-62a13754e385\">Big Read</a> explains. BA said today it planned to reinstate most of its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b1e3fc4-2c4c-4adb-834e-8ba82d775496#post-1054e5e6-2c64-49f2-b4b3-bf74f58b53f1\">transatlantic network</a> by the start of next summer. </p> <p>The damage from the pandemic has been widespread. Airlines, tour operators and hotels have had to be propped up by government handouts and loans, or have taken on more borrowing while sharply reducing headcounts.</p> <p>Optimists are citing the bounceback from 9/11 as proof that the lost ground is recoverable. As one New Yorker put it: “Everyone was like, ‘Oh my God, it's the end of the world, no one will ever get on a plane again or ever come back to New York again'. And then two years later [there was] the biggest boom time in New York for real estate [that lasted] for the next 20 years, plus everyone got back on planes and had the biggest numbers that they've ever had.” Short-haul airlines are also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01b58019-9398-4ebe-ad39-b0451ea42d29\">turning more bullish</a>: Jet2 and easyJet are among those preparing for a potential rush to destinations such as Greece next year. </p> <p>However, opinion is divided over the future of the $1.4tn business travel segment, the key driver of profit for carriers such as British Airways. Some argue that the rise of videoconferencing and environmental pressures mean things will never be the same again. Lettings company Airbnb believes business travellers are changing their approach, extending work trips into holidays and choosing to work from more exotic locations. Brian Chesky, the company's chief executive, argues that travel isn't “going back to where it was because I don't think the world is going back to where it was”. </p> <p>But even against the backdrop of a critical <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f1f870c-4e44-4e20-a6a3-fc13aa065119\">climate change summit</a>, not everyone is convinced that green concerns will trump our urge to travel. As Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary puts it in his typical forthright fashion: “The idea that post-Covid people will never travel again, or post-COP people will stop flying or flight shaming? [It's] never going to happen.”</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Randal Quarles, a US Federal Reserve governor, will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b1e3fc4-2c4c-4adb-834e-8ba82d775496#post-e041a6c2-048e-4878-b4f9-cd3f22270701\">leave the central bank</a> next month, creating another opening for the Biden administration to fill</p></li>  <li><p>Regeneron said its antibody drug reduced the risk of contracting Covid-19 by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/one-dose-of-regeneron-drug-prevents-covid-infections-for-months\">more than 81 per cent</a> in the two to eight-month period following the shot (Bloomberg)</p></li>  <li><p>EU authorities said there was no conclusive evidence of a cancer risk from synthetic face masks after a Belgian study warned that they may contain carcinogens (Reuters)</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute coronavirus updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b1e3fc4-2c4c-4adb-834e-8ba82d775496\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>The economic criteria necessary for the <strong>US Federal Reserve</strong> to raise interest rates <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61438126-7d10-4b45-8285-bc927136ac51\">could be met in 2022</a>, Fed vice-chair Richard Clarida said today. Meanwhile, President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> is confident of passing his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d97790e0-2d30-402e-965a-b0c0ffbad7eb\">$1.75tn social spending bill</a> after finally getting approval for his $1tn infrastructure plan from the House of Representatives on Friday night. </p> <p>The <strong>European Central Bank</strong>'s chief economist has said the economic situation in the eurozone was “completely different” to the US and UK, as he reinforced the pushback against market expectations of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b1e3fc4-2c4c-4adb-834e-8ba82d775496#post-0867010f-2924-4939-8b14-c825075b510d\">interest rate rises</a> next year. “This period of inflation is very unusual and temporary and not a sign of a chronic situation,” he argued.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p><strong>European gas prices</strong> surged this morning after there was little sign that Russia was preparing to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2a68e15-3db4-45bb-9575-8aea3291d88f\">increase supplies</a>, as promised by Russian president Vladimir Putin. The European benchmark price jumped as much as 10 per cent to above €80 per megawatt hour, while the UK benchmark for December delivery rose 6 per cent to £2.03 per therm. Russian oil and gas tycoon <strong>Mikhail Fridman</strong> has told the FT that moving too fast from gas to renewable energy was “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da12f0f4-0b5f-4b20-b51e-a92c87f7c62c\">dangerous and irresponsible</a>”.</p> <p><strong>Labour shortages</strong> in the UK are now affecting the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0a69335-9951-4a97-aa17-f3cb3ce60374\">analysis of X-rays</a>. A lack of radiologists means scans are being sent for analysis as far afield as Australia as NHS waiting lists lengthen. </p> <p>Discrepancies in how<strong> UK growth</strong> is recorded will be laid bare this week, with the publication of monthly and quarterly GDP figures. Economics editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e84a0e6-a893-42cf-8719-2e54c9477314\">Chris Giles explains</a>.</p> <p>A record number of new coronavirus infections have confirmed that <strong>Germany</strong> is now firmly in the grip of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b1e3fc4-2c4c-4adb-834e-8ba82d775496#post-18872b2b-335d-425a-b641-6cddf2916f3b\">fourth wave of the pandemic</a>. The country's health system is better able to cope than it was last winter, however, because a relatively large proportion of the population is now fully vaccinated.</p> <p><strong>Spain's recovery</strong> from the pandemic is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2af9039d-b2e1-4392-a5d3-cfb559f550f0\">lagging behind its eurozone peers</a>, writes Madrid correspondent Daniel Dombey. Although it has some of the lowest coronavirus infection rates in Europe, it is being held back by weak household spending, rising energy prices and a delay in the use of EU recovery money. Spain is one of the fund's main beneficiaries, with €140bn in grants and loans over the next six years.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>The UN's <strong>World Food Programme </strong>said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b1e3fc4-2c4c-4adb-834e-8ba82d775496#post-20ef16bb-4c85-48d7-9bf4-34df24dafd9f\">soaring food prices</a> were driving acute hunger to record levels, with 45m people on the edge of famine. The increases have been driven by a combination of poor weather, high demand, supply chain fallout from the pandemic and rocketing transportation costs.</p> <p>Officials in <strong>China</strong> have warned of a “complex and grave challenge this winter and next spring”, as new coronavirus cases <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ad85000-6fb1-474e-8bc7-949139aa0124\">continue to spread</a> in the broadest outbreak since the early days of the pandemic. New government restrictions have contributed to a slowdown in consumer spending just as energy shortages bite and problems in the property sector intensify. Chief foreign affairs commentator Gideon Rachman says Beijing's <strong>zero-Covid</strong> <strong>policy</strong> of self-isolation is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d00bff4-ac9d-486a-9a50-ae819e106d4c\">damaging international business</a>.</p> <p><strong>Argentina'</strong>s ruling Peronist party is the subject of anger over its handling of the economy and the pandemic ahead of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdd1ce4e-8cd8-46fc-b0a2-d48c98afc726\">congressional elections</a> on Sunday. Despite having one of Latin America's longest Covid-19 lockdowns, the country has failed to prevent a death toll that is almost as bad as neighbouring Brazil's, when adjusted for population size.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p>Sectors with complex supply chains have been particularly badly hit by the crisis. The $164bn <strong>paint market</strong> is a prime example. Customers have been hit with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f4a1579-2733-40e9-b052-cb0629296765\">soaring prices</a> as producers try and cover the rising costs of raw materials, while also dealing with rising demand during the lockdown DIY boom and severe weather disruption at the petrochemical plants that produce the raw materials. </p> <p>Simply surviving the pandemic intact was a challenge for most companies. But, for others, Covid-19 turned out to be a catalyst for <strong>growth and reinvention</strong>, writes chief business commentator <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f852006-7817-479e-ab8f-39e49759e598\">Brooke Masters</a>. <em>Read our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/tech-champions\"><em>Tech Champions</em></a><em> report detailing how European business has used technology to pivot to new ways of working amid the pandemic.</em></p> <p>As <strong>US employers</strong> scramble to clear backlogs at the nation's ports and warehouses, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4182c534-e40c-46f5-afd6-770564730860\">demand for night shift jobs</a> has exploded. Understaffing on late shifts and forced overtime have become key factors in the recent wave of strikes that activists have dubbed “striketober”.</p> <p>It's boom time for <strong>divorce lawyers </strong>as rich New Yorkers use the end of isolation as an appropriate time to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16d2bb50-07ef-4b67-ae0f-e908c219d0df\">end their marriages</a>. We talk to Robert Stephan Cohen, who has represented Melinda French Gates in her split from Bill Gates as well as being retained by the wife of John Paulson, the hedge fund manager who made $20bn betting against the housing market before the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p>The debate over whether US companies should be forced to impose “<strong>vaccine or test</strong>” orders on their workers intensified after a court ruling halted the government's plans over “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d00e65d3-3904-46ed-a2f0-2620f0e340e4\">grave statutory and constitutional issues</a>”.</p> <p><strong>Labour shortages</strong> have given workers a stronger hand in dealing with their employers, but what's the best way of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/967db31f-f49b-4039-a295-23db588d2a1c\">getting a pay rise</a>? Grace Lordan, a professor in behavioural science<em>, </em>details six pay-enhancing “life hacks”. </p> <p>The <strong>nature of celebrity</strong> changed during the pandemic, as stars began to be viewed as frivolous rather than aspirational. Companies are now more likely to feature actual workers in their social media, but the tactic can backfire: employees may end up promoting themselves as much as the brand and are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7f8fb0e-8f1a-4829-b818-cb9fe90352fa\">liable to spin out of control</a>, writes columnist Emma Jacobs. </p> <p><em>Get the latest worldwide picture with our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker/\"><em>vaccine tracker</em></a></p> <h1>And finally...</h1> <p>Q: What do Proust's bed, Dickens's armchair and a jar of Brylcreem have in common?
