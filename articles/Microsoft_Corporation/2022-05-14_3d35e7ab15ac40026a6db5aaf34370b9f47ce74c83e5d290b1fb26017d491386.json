  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Can TikTok Keep Users Hooked? --- The app capitalized on consumers' bite-sized attention spans. Now rivals are competing for the same eyeballs.",
  "text": "<p>Just a few years ago, China-based ByteDance's TikTok was an app for kids, with videos of anthropomorphic pets or freakishly talented children dancing. Now it seems like everyone is using it, no matter their age. Its growth has come at the expense of its competition, such that just about every social-media company is now pouring money into copycat products.</p><p>TikTok's founding genius is that it capitalized on consumers' short and capricious attention with a seemingly infinite collection of music-backed videos under 60 seconds algorithmically tailored to users' interests. Those still bored in under a minute can simply swipe until something else catches their eye.</p><p>In its latest installment of what it believes is the longest-running survey of digital media consumer behavior in America, Edison Research found 82% of polled U.S. adults now use social media, unchanged from last year. That means that, unlike most other sectors in tech like food delivery, ride-hailing or dating, social media apps are competing for the same users, not new ones.</p><p>It is a game that TikTok is winning. Back in 2019, 70% of 10-year-old girls with smartphones in the U.S. were using TikTok. Today, Edison Research's survey shows TikTok is the third-most used social-media app across users of all ages, topping Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest and LinkedIn.</p><p>But among younger users, gains appear to have come at the particular expense of Facebook. More people aged 12 to 34 are now using TikTok than Facebook, according to the survey, a marked change from just two years ago, when Facebook was leading TikTok in that demographic by 39 percentage points. It isn't just young people who are straying from social-media incumbents: Just 5% of people aged 35 to 54 were using TikTok two years ago; now more than a third of them are. Over that period, the percentage of that age demographic using Snapchat and LinkedIn didn't grow at all, while it declined 5 percentage points on Pinterest.</p><p>Broadly, TikTok's gains illustrate its early ability to bridge the age gap -- a unique point of differentiation among its social-media competitors.</p><p>Facebook and Instagram now have the short-form video platform Reels. Pinterest last year added Watch, where users can scroll through short videos and series of pictures. Snapchat launched short-form video product Spotlight in late 2020. Last year, YouTube globally launched Shorts, offering a platform for videos under 60 seconds. And even Twitter in December said it was testing out an updated \"Explore\" tab that follows a TikTok-like scrolling format that seems to favor short-form video tweets.</p><p>TikTok, like its social-media predecessors, is free to download and operates an ad-based model. As a private company, its exact revenue isn't publicly known. But eMarketer estimates TikTok generated nearly $4 billion in ad revenue last year and will triple that sum this year to become bigger than the combined ad business of Twitter and Snapchat. By 2024, the firm's estimates show TikTok's revenues essentially reaching parity with YouTube at over $23 billion.</p><p>From an advertising perspective, Stifel's Mark Kelley called TikTok a \"manageable threat\" to social-media incumbents, noting the platform has historically lacked the targeting and measuring tools available from competing platforms that advertisers lust after. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Mahaney said that, while advertisers are clearly looking to experiment with TikTok, he has yet to see big brand advertisers fully engage.</p><p>TikTok seems to be furiously working to address some of its shortcomings from both an advertiser and user perspective. Earlier this year, the platform enhanced its ability to target and measure its value proposition to advertisers by enabling first and third-party cookies on top of its existing tools.</p><p>TikTok is also expanding from its short-form underpinnings. Less than a year after it raised the maximum length of a video to three minutes, TikTok said early this year that it is extending that length to 10 minutes. Traditional YouTube videos can be up to 15 minutes and verified users' videos can be hourslong.</p><p>It could be that advertisers will come, wherever the users are. Similarweb data show traffic to TikTok's ads site was up nearly 200% in the first quarter. Users of TikTok's Android app spent an average of more than an hour and 22 minutes a day on the service in March -- more than for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, or YouTube, data from Similarweb shows.</p><p>Internally, TikTok's rapid rise has required a grueling grind. A recent investigation by The Wall Street Journal revealed a U.S. office culture that is described as demanding and secretive, with several former employees describing 85 hours of meetings a week in addition to their regular work, and instances of culture clash with the Beijing-based parent company. TikTok had about 1,500 employees in the U.S. last year and has plans to add 10,000 more, according to the Journal's report.</p><p>But will its investment continue to pay off?</p><p>\"I can't sit here and say in 10 years they'll be the dominant platform still,\" says Evercore ISI's Mr. Mahaney; however he also noted that a billion-plus users will probably buy you at least \"a few years\" in the sun.</p>",
