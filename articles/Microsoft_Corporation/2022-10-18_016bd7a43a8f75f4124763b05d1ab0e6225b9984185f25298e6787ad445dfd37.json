  "title": "Billionaire MacKenzie Scott to Donate Nearly $85 Million to Girl Scouts of the USA; Donation from the philanthropist is the Girl Scouts' largest ever from a single individual",
  "text": "<p>The money is the largest donation from a single individual in the organization's history, according to the organization, and will allow the Girl Scouts to fund existing programs, expand diversity in the group's membership and help it recover from the effects of Covid-19.</p><p>\"The support from all our donors, including this generous donation from Ms. Scott, is critical in delivering on our work of reimagination and transformation,\" said Girl Scouts of the USA CEO Sofia Chang. \"We're excited to prove how Ms. Scott's investment in girls will change the worldâ€”because when one girl succeeds, we all succeed.\"</p><p>Ms. Scott is worth an estimated $27.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a ranking updated daily of the richest people in the world.</p><p>Ms. Scott couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>In 2019, Ms. Scott announced that she had signed the Giving Pledge, founded by Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, his now ex-wife Melinda French Gates and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. The initiative encourages the world's richest individuals and couples to give more than half of their wealth to philanthropy or charitable causes, either during their lifetime or in their wills. \"I have a disproportionate amount of money to share,\" she wrote at the time.</p><p>Since then, Ms. Scott has given away billions of dollars to hundreds of organizations that include historically Black colleges and universities, Covid-19 relief groups, food banks and groups working in education.</p><p>In March, Ms. Scott said she had given $3.86 billion to 465 groups in the previous nine months, including Habitat for Humanity International and Planned Parenthood Federation of America. In May, Ms. Scott donated $122.6 million to Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.</p><p>She was formerly married to Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, with whom she played an instrumental role in creating the retail giant. She received 4% of the company's shares as part of their divorce settlement.</p><p>Last month, Ms. Scott filed for divorce from her second husband, Dan Jewett.</p><p>Ms. Scott's donation comes as the Girl Scouts recover from the effects of Covid-19 as well as a cookie shortage.</p><p>Inflation and supply-chain issues presented challenges for Girl Scout cookie sales earlier this year. Cookie production delays undermined fundraising efforts for some regional councils that rely on sales for roughly 70% of their operating revenue, or about $800 million annually.</p><p>A Girls Scouts spokesperson said cookies, while a major source of revenue, are only part of the programs that make an impact at the troop level. \"Donations like Ms. Scott's and all of our funders are so important to support the girls' communities in ZIP Codes across the country,\" they said.</p><p>Earlier this year, the Girl Scouts lost its trademark infringement lawsuit filed against the Boy Scouts of America. The girls-only group failed to show any confusion from the Boy Scouts' efforts to recruit girls into coed programming, a federal judge said in his ruling.</p><p>The Boy Scouts has expanded its reach in recent years to counter a decline in membership, allowing girls, openly gay boys and transgender youth to join. This fueled concerns in the Girl Scouts that its appeal to girls would be undercut as it was forced to compete for the first time with the larger Boy Scouts for recruits.</p><p>Write to Talal Ansari at talal.ansari@wsj.com</p><p>Billionaire MacKenzie Scott to Donate Nearly $85 Million to Girl Scouts of the USA</p>",
