  "text": "<p>Ahead of the market open, shares of Robinhood Markets dropped more than 11%. The trading app recorded a 35% decline in revenue from the previous quarter, driven by lower volumes of crypto trading. The results knocked shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global, which fell more than 4%. Bitcoin's dollar value fell 5% to $58,994.56.</p><p>Early Wednesday, McDonald's said higher prices had lifted its U.S. sales, lifting shares 3% premarket. Microsoft rose 2% premarket after the company reported a 48% rise in net income in the three months through September, boosted by the shift toward home work. Twitter shares were up 1.8% ahead of the market open in response to a 37% increase in third-quarter revenue.</p><p>Enphase Energy, meantime, jumped more than 13% after KeyBanc analysts bumped up their target price for the stock.</p><p>Solid quarterly earnings from American corporations have quelled the investor concerns about supply-chain problems, inflation and Chinese economic growth that rattled markets at the start of fall. The S&amp;P 500 is up 6.2% for October and on course for its biggest monthly advance since November.</p><p>\"Investors got fairly gloomy in September, clearly against the backdrop of all sorts of macro concerns,\" said Paul O'Connor, head of the multiasset team at Janus Henderson Investors. \"The broader story from results is that companies are managing these dynamics pretty well, and also managing expectations fairly well.\"</p><p>Money managers still have worries, ranging from the fate of President Biden's infrastructure and social-spending plans to the potential unwind of Federal Reserve stimulus measures that have goosed markets since early 2020. For now, though, many investors say they are sticking with stocks in the expectation of modest if bumpy returns through the end of the year.</p><p>Earnings season is in full swing, with about a third of companies on the S&amp;P 500 having filed through Tuesday. Another rush of results Wednesday will offer clues about how companies are navigating shortages of workers and raw materials. Ford Motor and eBay are expected to report after markets close.</p><p>On the economic front, data on orders of durable goods are due to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists polled by FactSet expect orders to have fallen 1% in September from August, reflecting disruption to supply chains in the auto industry and other sectors.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes down to 1.596% Wednesday from 1.618% Tuesday. Yields move in the opposite direction to bond prices.</p><p>There were broad declines in overseas markets. The Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.5%, pulling back from its second-highest close on record. Bank shares retreated, with Deutsche Bank sliding more than 5% after the German lender reported a fall in investment-banking revenue. Shares of resource and oil-and-gas companies also lost ground.</p><p>Asian markets fell after American officials barred China Telecom, China's biggest telecom operator, from doing business in the U.S., adding to investor concerns over tensions between the two biggest economies. China's Shanghai Composite Index fell 1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1.6%.</p><p>Oil prices pulled back from seven-year highs as traders awaited data on U.S. petroleum supplies, due at 10:30 a.m. Futures for West Texas Intermediate, the main grade of U.S. crude, slipped 1.5% to $83.35 a barrel. Copper prices fell 1.5% to $4.42 a pound in New York.</p><p>Stock Futures Wobble Amid McDonald's, Other Earnings</p>",
