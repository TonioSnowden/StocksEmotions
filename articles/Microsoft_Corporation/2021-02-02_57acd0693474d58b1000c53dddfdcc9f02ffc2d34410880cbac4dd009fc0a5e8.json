  "text": "<p>\n  In the past few weeks, investors have bid up the share prices of companies such as GameStop Corp. and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., as short sellers have bet against them. An analysis of the challenges and prospects for these businesses shows they have a tough road ahead. </p><p>\n  GameStop is trying to survive a yearslong erosion of its business, which has relied for nearly four decades on people visiting its bricks-and-mortar stores to buy the latest videogames and consoles, as well as to trade in used games. </p><p>\n  The company has been stung by mounting competition from retail giants such as Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc., and technology that enables people to download games. It has also gone through a period of high executive turnover, with CEO George Sherman being the fifth person to hold the role since November 2017. </p><p>\n  To preserve its business, GameStop has been working to pay down debt and pledged to accelerate its e-commerce operations. In the recent holiday season, the company's e-commerce sales rose more than 300% from the year-earlier period, helped by new consoles from Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp. </p><p>\n  One of GameStop's newest board members, Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen, urged the company last year to exit underperforming stores in the U.S. Analysts expect GameStop to post its fourth consecutive annual decline in revenue in its latest fiscal year. </p><p>\n  -- Sarah E. Needleman </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  AMC, the world's largest cinema chain with nearly 1,000 locations, became the latest darling of the retail trading scene after it signed a series of financing deals that are expected to help it ward off bankruptcy. </p><p>\n  Since the pandemic forced AMC to temporarily close most of its theaters, the company has faced the real possibility of running out of cash, and warned investors in October that it might need to file for chapter 11 if it doesn't raise enough money from investors willing to bet on its recovery. AMC's fortunes began to turn with the introduction of coronavirus vaccines late last year, which raised hopes among investors that it won't be too long before people start going out to the movies again. </p><p>\n  AMC has raised about $1.3 billion of debt and equity financing since December, selling out its latest shelf offering on Jan. 27 right after users in Reddit's WallStreetBets forum turned their attention to it. </p><p>\n  Chief Executive Adam Aron warned on Jan. 25 that while \"any talk of an imminent bankruptcy is completely off the table,\" investors in AMC are still advised to exercise caution as the company's future cash needs are uncertain. </p><p>\n  -- Alexander Gladstone </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Home-goods retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, after an activist investor ousted prior management in 2019, is trying to fashion a turnaround under new CEO Mark Tritton, a former Target Corp. executive. Mr. Tritton has hired a new leadership team that is decluttering stores, simplifying prices and streamlining merchandise. </p><p>\n  The company is closing about 200 of its more than 970 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores and has sold assets such as Christmas Tree Shops. It has launched a share-repurchase program totaling as much as $825 million over three years. </p><p>\n  The company is benefiting from a shift in pandemic-driven spending toward items for the home. But some analysts worry that once life returns to normal, it will give up some gains as shoppers spend more on travel and eating out. On Jan. 26, before the stock gave up some of its recent gains, UBS downgraded it to \"sell.\" </p><p>\n  -- Suzanne Kapner </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  BlackBerry CEO John Chen successfully rescued the Canadian company from near collapse after he was hired in 2013 to reinvent a smartphone maker that had ceded its global market dominance to competitors such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. He shrank the company's staff and global operations and licensed other manufacturers to make BlackBerry phones. </p><p>\n  Mr. Chen, a software veteran, sought to reinvent BlackBerry by selling software and services designed to shield business and government communication systems and mobile devices from viruses and other online threats. </p><p>\n  The company has reported net losses for the last seven quarters. </p><p>\n  Another setback is uneven demand for automobiles during the pandemic. BlackBerry sells security products to auto makers. </p><p>\n  -- Jacquie McNish </p><p></p>",
