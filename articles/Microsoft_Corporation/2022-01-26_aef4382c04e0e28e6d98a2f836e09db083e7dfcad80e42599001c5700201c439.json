  "title": "Stocks Turn Lower Amid Powell Comments, Fed Statement; Fed indicated plans to raise interest rates in March, conduct one more round of asset purchases",
  "text": "<p>Stocks turned lower during Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference, which followed the statement. The S&amp;P 500 was recently down 0.5% in seesaw trading following the Fed's afternoon announcement. The broad index fell Tuesday and has declined in five of the past six trading days. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 0.7% lower.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note recently traded at 1.849%, compared with 1.782% at Tuesday's close. Yields move inversely to prices.</p><p>Stocks have been whipsawed in recent days by expectations that the Fed will embark on a series of rate increases this year to temper heightened inflation. The prospect of a shrinking balance sheet and higher rates has prompted some to sell risky assets, including shares of technology companies that promise future returns, and cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Economists had expected the Fed to indicate that it was ready to start raising rates in March. Traders in interest-rate futures markets are betting that the Fed will increase rates four or five times this year, according to CME Group.</p><p>\"It's definitely a wild start to the year,\" said Josh Chastant, a senior investment analyst at GuideStone Capital Management. \"That's to be expected when you go from a stimulative Fed to less accommodative.\"</p><p>The Fed's statement noted the continued spread of the Omicron variant of Covid-19, saying that \"the path of the economy continues to depend on the course of the virus.\" U.S. data showed daily average deaths from the disease exceeding the peak of the Delta variant.</p><p>Wednesday's advance in markets comes after a rough January. All three major indexes were down year-to-date as of Tuesday's close, with the Nasdaq declining 13%.</p><p>Earlier, tech stocks lifted markets Wednesday, but the S&amp;P's tech sector gave up most gains in afternoon trading. Microsoft shares rose 1.7% after the software giant said its earnings continued to grow as its cloud-services business stayed strong. Semiconductors also held up: Nvidia rose 0.2%, Micron Technology added 0.2% and AMD slipped 2%.</p><p>Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said before the Fed release that investors should consider stocks in economically sensitive sectors, rather than tech stocks, which can be less attractive during times of rising interest rates.</p><p>\"It's premature to say, 'OK, that flush was it, and now we just get back into the bull market steaming ahead,'\" Mr. Luschini said.</p><p>Investors are also monitoring rising tensions between Russia and Ukraine that have drawn the focus of NATO allies. Geopolitical turbulence has buoyed oil in recent days, pushing it to the highest levels since 2014.</p><p>The VIX, a measure of expected volatility that is sometimes dubbed Wall Street's fear gauge, ticked down 2.97 points to 28.19. The gauge has climbed this week as stock markets fell.</p><p>Shares of Mattel gained 3.5% after The Wall Street Journal reported that it won the license to produce toys based on Walt Disney's princess lineup, and from the \"Frozen\" franchise.</p><p>Earnings season continues, with Tesla and Intel slated to report after markets close. Tesla shares turned lower, falling 1%.</p><p>In other stocks, shares of Texas Instruments gained 1.7% after the company reported higher revenue. AT&amp;T shares fell 9% after the company swung to a profit as it improved its wireless revenue and shed the burden of its customer-losing pay-TV business in 2021.</p><p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, added 1.8% to $88.75 a barrel. Supply questions have helped push prices higher.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.7%, with the biggest gains in the travel and leisure sector. Stock indexes in Asia closed mixed. China's Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.7% and 0.2%, respectively. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi each declined 0.4%.</p><p>Bitcoin's dollar value rose 3.1% from its 5 p.m. ET level Tuesday to $37,749. The world's largest cryptocurrency by market value has recently sagged alongside broader markets, shedding nearly half its value from its November peak.</p><p>Write to Hardika Singh at hardika.singh@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Turn Lower Amid Powell Comments, Fed Statement</p>",
