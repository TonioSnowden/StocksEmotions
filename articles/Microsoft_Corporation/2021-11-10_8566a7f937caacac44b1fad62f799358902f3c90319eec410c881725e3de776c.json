  "text": "<h2>This week's problem</h2> <p>I am moving back to London after working overseas for two decades. During this time, I have gained an MBA, worked for two multinationals in senior roles and am now completing a stint as an innovation and business development director for a global company. I have been applying for jobs via LinkedIn but have not been successful. How should I adjust my approach? <strong>Male, 50s</strong></p> <h2>Jonathan's answer</h2> <p>You are returning to the UK capital with a wealth of experience working in other cultures, demonstrable responsibilities in senior roles, multinational experience and, with your <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/mba\">MBA</a>, a higher business qualification. You can, no doubt, expand your elevator pitch to tell a recruiter about your achievements and responsibilities, two key reasons for them to employ you.</p> <p>Recently, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d910754-3568-412c-8a10-9e4806a83b11\">LinkedIn</a> seems to have become a repository for people to record personal delight with their own or family achievements, and for corporate promotion. Seemingly buried are recruitment opportunities, but have you found these are the sorts of roles that would even be suitable or of interest?</p> <p>While answering job ads is one way to secure a new role, at your stage and with your experience, there are other routes to uncovering opportunities that may be at least equally but probably more productive; the most powerful of which is networking or information interviewing (others include using executive search and cold calling).</p> <p>In terms of adjusting your approach, you could use LinkedIn as a useful resource of new contacts, especially as you have been out of the UK for some time. Use the platform to identify people already in roles and industries you are targeting (based on your skills and interests), and contact them to seek their advice and insight.</p> <p>At this stage, you are not contacting them to ask for a job, you are gathering data, exploring what is available and, above all, you are building your <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88897f3a-33a1-11ea-a329-0bcf87a328f2\">professional network</a>. Success in building relationships comes from what you can give the other person, rather than what they can give you. You may even consider posting useful information and insights on LinkedIn to build your profile.</p> <p>The virtual world of the past two years has made it very difficult to build social relationships, the foundation of which is how you make the other person feel, rather than the words you use. A platform like LinkedIn limits communication even further, compressing interactions to short text messages — providing scant opportunity to transmit human warmth.</p> <p>The timing is good for you in arranging in-person meetings as the UK emerges from the pandemic. Use real-life conferences, your existing contacts (yes, and LinkedIn) to start your exploration. Have your short introduction ready: what you've done, insights you could share and what you're exploring (these can go on your LinkedIn summary as well).</p> <p>You can increase your chance of success, of uncovering opportunities and, above all, of meeting interesting people, the more networking you do.</p> <h2>Readers' advice</h2> <p>Make sure you are looking at unglamorous sectors with jobs outside the City — environmental services? Logistics? Think broadly. <strong>Zimt2</strong></p> <p>Consult independently at first, partly to remove time pressures, and partly with the aim of potentially converting a short-term gig into a permanent role, by demonstrating value and identifying areas where you can help them further. <strong>New Londoner</strong></p> <p>I think many employers discount overseas applicants until they are actually in the country. <strong>George Horsington</strong></p> <p><strong>Jonathan Black is director of the Careers Service at the University of Oxford.
