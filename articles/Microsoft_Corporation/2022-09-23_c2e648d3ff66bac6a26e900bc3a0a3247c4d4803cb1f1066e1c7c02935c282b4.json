  "title": "MANSION  ---  Private Properties:  Central Park Co-op Goes on the Market  ----  By Katherine Clarke",
  "text": "<p>   A Manhattan apartment long owned by the late pharmaceutical executive Martin Howard Solomon is coming to market for $55 million. </p><p>   Mr. Solomon and his wife, Sarah Billinghurst Solomon, paid $25 million for the Upper East Side home in 2004, according to property records. </p><p>   The neo-Italian Renaissance-style building, a co-op on the edge of Central Park, was designed by prominent architect J.E.R. Carpenter around 1920. The boutique building has drawn power players such as the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. </p><p>   The five-bedroom apartment has views over Central Park and the city, said Serena Boardman of Sotheby's International Realty, one of the listing agents. With 11 rooms, it has large entertaining spaces, multiple wood-burning fireplaces and a dining room that can seat close to 30 people, she said.Ms. Boardman declined to specify the unit's square footage. </p><p>   Mrs. Solomon said she and her husband were originally drawn to the apartment for its light and for its proximity to the park. A former executive at the Metropolitan Opera, she used to cross the park to work, she said. </p><p>   The couple tapped French architect and decorator Robert Couturier to renovate the apartment, and it remains in good condition, Mrs. Solomon said. She and her husband were avid entertainers and hosted numerous musical recitals and dinner parties in the apartment, she said. </p><p>   Mr. Solomon was a partner at Hildred Capital Management, a private-equity firm, and chief executive of the pharmaceutical company Forest Laboratories. He died in January at age 94. Mrs. Solomon said she is selling the apartment because it is too large for her. \"As my granddaughter said to me, 'This is just too cavernous for one person,'\" she said. </p><p>   Ms. Boardman said the co-op market has remained \"fairly solid\" over the past year, and noted that the building has recently posted a number of major sales. Earlier this year, Mr. Allen's estate sold a pair of apartments at the building for $101 million to Julia Koch, wife of late billionaire David Koch. Financier J. Christopher Flowers also recently purchased a unit at the building for $43 million, records show. </p><p>   Ms. Boardman shares the listing with colleague Maria Bazo. </p><p></p>",
