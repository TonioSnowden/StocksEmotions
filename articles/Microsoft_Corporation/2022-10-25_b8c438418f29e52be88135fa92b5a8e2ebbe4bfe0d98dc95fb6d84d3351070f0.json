  "text": "<p>US stocks closed higher on Tuesday ahead of a busy day of third-quarter corporate results, while Asian equities fell further after suffering historic declines in the previous session.</p> <p>On Wall Street, the broad S&amp;P 500 index added 1.6 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3 per cent, as investors looked ahead to earnings reports after the close from some of the world's largest technology companies including Alphabet, Spotify and Microsoft.</p> <p>Investors have been sifting through corporate earnings reports over the past two weeks for signs of strain from high inflation and rising borrowing costs.</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve has raised <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/us-interest-rates\">interest rates</a> aggressively this year, implementing extra-large increases of 0.75 percentage points over each of its past three meetings to a target range of 3 to 3.25 per cent. The central bank's rate-setters meet again next week.</p> <p>The pressure of tighter monetary policy has weighed heavily on equity and bond markets in recent months, with the S&amp;P 500 last month closing out its longest streak of quarterly losses since 2008. Higher interest rates mean elevated borrowing costs for companies, while also biting into businesses' future projected cash flows.</p> <p>Traders have also contended with elevated volatility in recent months.</p> <p>Jeff O'Connor, head of market structure for the Americas at Liquidnet, said traders were facing “once in a generation headwinds” and having to contend with erratic market conditions. “The market has become accustomed to the real price volatility, almost desensitised to it,” he said. “The wild moves are making trading conditions that much more difficult.”</p> <p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell 0.14 percentage points to 4.10 per cent, while the dollar fell 1 per cent against a basket of six other currencies. </p> <p>Yields on 10-year gilts fell 0.11 percentage points to 3.63 per cent after Rishi Sunak was confirmed as the UK's third prime minister in seven weeks. Sterling jumped 1.7 per cent against the dollar to $1.147.</p> <p>In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.1 per cent following its biggest single-day drop since 2008 on Monday and confirmation of China president Xi Jinping's third term in power. The CSI 300 index of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed equities fell 0.2 per cent, while China's renminbi hit its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/beb82d8b-e0f4-49f6-8848-02f65b71a1b4\">weakest level</a> against the dollar since 2007.</p> <p>Europe's regional Stoxx 600 closed 1.4 per cent higher and Germany's Dax reversed losses to rise 0.9 per cent even as the country's Ifo Institute noted that domestic business sentiment “<a href=\"https://www.ifo.de/en/facts/2022-10-25/ifo-business-climate-remains-gloomy-october-2022\">continues to be grim</a>”.</p> <p>Martin Wolburg, senior economist at Generali Investments, said he expected the European Central Bank to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage points to 1.5 per cent on Thursday in an attempt to tackle rising consumer prices, which reached 10 per cent in the eurozone in the year to September.</p> <p>Prices for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d2d1e54-b2b7-4213-a1c4-daf9d42884cc\">European natural gas rose</a>, erasing some of the decline in the previous session, with Dutch TTF gas futures — the benchmark regional contract — up 4.2 per cent on Tuesday to €99 per megawatt hour. Gas prices on Monday fell below €100/MWh for the first time since mid-June, when Russia cut supplies.</p><p>Source: Jaren Kerr in New York and George Steer in London 2022 'US shares close higher ahead of further batch of corporate earnings' FT.com 25 October.
