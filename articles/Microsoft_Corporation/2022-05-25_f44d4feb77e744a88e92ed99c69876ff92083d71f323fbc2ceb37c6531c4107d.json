  "text": "<p>The German Bastian Nominacher has had a dramatic rise as an entrepreneur, rivalling many a Silicon Valley founder. </p> <p>As a student doing consultancy work for Bavaria's public broadcaster in 2010, the bespectacled computer scientist witnessed employees' frustrations with their temperamental printing system. He managed to solve the problem by tracking the way data moved around the company's outdated software suites.</p> <p>Soon local industrial giants Siemens and BMW caught wind of his solution — which could be applied to solve a host of other digital inefficiencies — and became some of the first customers of Celonis, the process mining start-up Nominacher co-founded with university friends in 2011. The business has flourished into one of Germany's highest-valued tech companies, worth €11bn.</p> <p>Yet Nominacher has remained almost as anonymous as he would have been had he followed in his father's footsteps to become a baker — the family profession for five generations. </p> <p>Much of this has undoubtedly to do with the nature of Celonis's business. While appreciated by corporate customers such as L'Oréal, BP and GSK, it takes a good minute to explain to the less technically literate. Plus, in contrast to French unicorns, which can expect <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emmanuelmacron_nous-y-sommes-exotec-devient-la-25%C3%A8me-activity-6888732122266378240-BTuI/\">shout-outs</a> on Emmanuel Macron's LinkedIn account, Celonis lacks vociferous cheerleaders in Munich and Berlin, or indeed in the popular media.</p> <p>Still, the founders of similarly prosaic companies in the US, such as Marc Benioff's Salesforce, have little trouble attracting the business headlines. Likewise, a brash American with a talent for sales, Bill McDermott, lifted the profile of the enterprise software giant SAP, Germany's largest tech company. Since he&#xa0;left in 2019, it has struggled to maintain that interest.</p> <p>SAP supervisory board chief Hasso Plattner even <a href=\"https://www.handelsblatt.com/technik/it-internet/tech-konzern-in-amerika-macht-der-obermotz-eine-ansage-plattner-erklaert-die-sap-transformation/28250892.html\">admitted</a> to German newspaper Handelsblatt last month that while his company had “better financial figures, [competitor] Oracle puts on better press conferences”.</p> <p>Much of this disparity is by design. Germany's renowned “hidden champions” are often family-owned engineering companies sitting on invaluable patents and piles of cash, with little desire or need for exposure in the press. There is a cultural element too. Communications professionals in Germany talk disparagingly of the approach typified by — in the example given by one senior adviser — American driverless auto companies without so much as a working prototype to show off. </p> <p>Yet this divide is proving to be a problem, and not just for start-ups facing a rockier financing road than Celonis. Germany's largest and most sclerotic industrial groups — namely, its carmakers — are finding it harder to capture the attention of investors. Volkswagen is the world's second-largest electric vehicle maker, yet it is worth about €600bn less than leader Tesla, the value of which can spike based on an Elon Musk tweet. Mercedes-Benz <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ce79ba8-8a3c-48af-a451-8fda4dd4960f\">posted</a> a record €14bn in profits last year — albeit mostly from selling combustion engine cars — and its share price has hardly moved. The lesson Mercedes took from this, a person close to the company said, was that it had to “make more noise”.</p> <p>Cue a star-studded event in the French Riviera last week, at which rapper will.i.am was enlisted to explain the enduring allure of the Mercedes brand to assembled investors and analysts. At the same function, chief executive Ola Källenius, a Swede not given to hyperbole, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ce79ba8-8a3c-48af-a451-8fda4dd4960f\">cited a beautiful 6,000-year-old jade axe</a> to convince attendees that luxury items had always been in demand and would remain so despite the worsening economic climate.</p> <p>Rival Herbert Diess at VW has taken a riskier approach, posting regularly to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess\">social media accounts</a> in English and Chinese, publicly praising Musk while criticising one of his own subsidiaries, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8c2482d-c7af-4d7e-87e7-87562194250b\">straying into</a> geopolitics by calling for Europe to explore peace talks in order to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>Neither of these approaches have helped much yet. But they are an acknowledgment that German execution alone is no guarantee of long-term success.</p> <p>Both bosses insist it is only a matter of time before the world sees they are following through on their promises, with better cost discipline and convincing electric cars. But they also appear to realise that they can no longer count on the product to do all the talking. That is a lesson for German companies big and small. One that Nominacher's Celonis, as it gears up for an expected initial public offering,&#xa0;will have to bear in mind.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:joe.miller@ft.com\"><em>joe.miller@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Joe Miller 2022 'German companies struggle to be heard above the noise' FT.com 25 May.
