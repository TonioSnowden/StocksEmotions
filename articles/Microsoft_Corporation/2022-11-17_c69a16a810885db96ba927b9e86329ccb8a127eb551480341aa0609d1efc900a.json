  "title": "Schneider Electric-Backed Venture Firm to Launch $520 Million Fund; Startups tapped by SE Ventures could help energy giant fill gaps in tech stack",
  "text": "<p>With its second fund, the firm, based in Menlo Park, Calif., seeks to double down on a goal of fostering cutting-edge tech startups, some of which may eventually help Schneider Electric fill gaps in its own technology stack, products or servicesâ€”either as a business partner or an acquisition, said Amit Chaturvedy, SE Ventures global head and managing partner.</p><p>Startups building energy-management and other industrial-scale tools often require a longer runway to achieve revenue growth than those building consumer software apps, Mr. Chaturvedy said. \"These are areas that take longer to evolve,\" he said.</p><p>But by leveraging insight from Schneider Electric's customers and industry partners, SE Ventures can identify pockets of demand for specific services and match those with promising startups, Mr. Chaturvedy said. \"Much of that tech exists today, but we have to move faster to commercialization,\" he said.</p><p>To date, SE Ventures has 30 active investments, including climate and industrial tech ventures, a pace it expects to accelerate with the new fund, he said. About 70% have struck a commercial partnership with Schneider Electric, the company said.</p><p>In May, Schneider Electric announced a deal to acquire AutoGrid, a smart-grid technology startup backed by SE Ventures that builds software designed to harness untapped capability in batteries, such as those in electric vehicles or backup electrical power. SE Ventures first invested in AutoGrid in the company's Series D fundraising round in 2019. Terms of the acquisition weren't disclosed.</p><p>The AutoGrid deal \"brings the tech in-house and will allow Schneider Electric to incorporate it in its own offerings, like EV chargers and charging software, into AutoGrid's products, said Thomas Hodson, an energy-sector analyst at analytics firm CB Insights.</p><p>Mr. Hodson said through SE Ventures, Schneider Electric has a good record of targeting investments to areas where it wants to expand. For instance, predictive-maintenance startup Augury, another standout investment, last year hit a private-market valuation of $1 billion, following a $180 million funding round in October. Predictive maintenance is an AI-powered technology designed to predict equipment malfunctions before they occur.</p><p>Augury has dozens of other large corporate customers, including PepsiCo Inc., which has deployed Augury's AI-powered systems in its Frito-Lay manufacturing plants.</p><p>As an investor, SE Ventures is also not afraid to pivot, Mr. Hodson said. After participating in early funding rounds by hydroelectric startup Natel Energy Inc., SE Ventures later appeared to shift away from the emerging power-generation technology market, Mr. Hodson said.</p><p>Saar Yoskovitz, Augury's co-founder and chief executive, said an advantage of having SE Ventures as an investor is access to industry domain experts \"that startups can leverage as they build their strategy or explore new technologies.\"</p><p>Still, the move to double its investment fund comes at a time when most venture-capital investors are pulling back from the market, as they wait out turbulence in the public tech sector, rising interest rates and a dimming economic outlook.</p><p>\"There's definitely a market reality where there is a large degree of uncertainty,\" Mr. Chaturvedy said.</p><p>The number of corporate venture-capital deals worldwide in the third quarter fell 14% on a quarterly basis to 1,098, according to CB Insights. Over the same period, total funding dollars dropped 34% to $18.6 billion, the firm said.</p><p>Other large corporate venture-capital investors include Alphabet Inc.'s GV, Salesforce Inc.'s Salesforce Ventures and Microsoft Corp.'s M12.</p><p>For now, Mr. Chaturvedy plans to target earlier-stage startups, which are less buffeted by the economy. Seed- and early-stage startups appear to be picking up some of the slack from the sharp declines in investments faced by more mature startups, taking in an estimated 61% of total deal share this year, compared with 55% in 2021, CB Insights said.</p><p>Mr. Chaturvedy said startups that are solving real-world problems are always in demand. The challenge, he said, is to help bring their technology to market as quickly as possible.</p><p>Write to Angus Loten at Angus.Loten@wsj.com</p><p>Schneider Electric-Backed Venture Firm to Launch $520 Million Fund</p>",
