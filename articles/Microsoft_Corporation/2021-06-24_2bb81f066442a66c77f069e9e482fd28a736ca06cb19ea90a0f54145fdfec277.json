Disturbingly, Jenkins concludes these past events offer a “terrifying portent” of the possible impact threatened by today's climate crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1847925448?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=1847925448\"><strong>Under a White Sky</strong></a><strong>: The Nature of the Future</strong><br>by Elizabeth Kolbert, <em>Penguin Random House $28</em></p> <p>The title refers to the colour the sky would turn if plans to tackle global warming by spreading particles in the stratosphere to reflect sunlight ever materialise. Alas, as this Pulitzer Prize-winning science writer shows, such planetary “geoengineering” is just one of the ways humans are trying to manage natural systems once deemed unmanageable.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1913348687/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1913348687&amp;linkId=6de22dd63507ae350478821afe3e3bb7\"><strong>The New Climate War</strong></a><strong>: The Fight to Take Back Our Planet</strong><br>by Michael E Mann, <em>Scribe Publications £16.99/PublicAffairs $15.99</em></p> <p>In this thought-provoking book, one of the best-known climate scientists argues that outright denial of climate science has been replaced by a softer, more insidious war on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6bdc4b1-d41f-49f0-a3df-61614cc1a2b7\">climate action</a>. If you think vegan diets and flight-shaming alone will solve the climate problem, rather than the broad, systemic measures “inactivists” fear, this book may make you think again.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0241448301/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0241448301&amp;linkId=1a09ecccd384e2f79ac767c9a90c755f\"><strong>How to Avoid a Climate Disaster</strong></a><strong>: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need</strong><br>by Bill Gates, <em>Allen Lane £20</em></p> <p>This book is not perfect. It plays down both the need for immediate climate action and the effectiveness of existing green technologies, such as offshore wind power. But it is still a useful, and admirably comprehensible, guide to the basics of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6bdc4b1-d41f-49f0-a3df-61614cc1a2b7\">climate problem</a> — and what it could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c11bb885-1274-4677-ba05-fcbac67dc808\">cost to fix it</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0241472520?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0241472520\"><strong>How to Save Our Planet</strong></a><strong>: The Facts</strong><br>by Mark Maslin, <em>Penguin Life £7.99</em></p> <p>Did you know we've made enough concrete to cover the entire surface of the Earth in a layer 2mm thick? Or that there are more Lego mini-people than actual people? This British climate scientist's deceptively simple guide shows adults and children alike what humans have done to the planet, and how to fix it.</p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: Pilita Clark 2021 'Summer books of 2021: Environment' FT.com 24 June.
