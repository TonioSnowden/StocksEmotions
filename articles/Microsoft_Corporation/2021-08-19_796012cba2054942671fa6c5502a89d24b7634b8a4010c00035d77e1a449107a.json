  "text": "<p>Stocks hit turbulence this week after major indexes posted a series of record highs. Investors broadly remain upbeat about the outlook for share prices given the rapid pace of earnings growth. But some have become more cautious, concerned that rising coronavirus cases will dent the global economic recovery at the same time as the Federal Reserve gears up to rein in its huge bond-buying program.</p><p>\"These things are going to cause market volatility,\" said Caroline Simmons, U.K chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. \"People are trying to work out what [the Delta variant] is going to mean: does it mean more lockdowns, is it going to damage growth?\"</p><p>Commodity markets offered signs of caution Thursday, as oil and copper prices retreated. The energy and materials sectors were the worst-performing groups in the S&amp;P 500, with shares of Devon Energy, miner Freeport-McMoRan and Occidental Petroleum all down 3% or more.</p><p>Trading was choppy, with stocks rising into positive territory early in the session before paring gains.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has rallied 17% in 2021, keeping stock valuations at historically high levels. But with low yields in the bond market, many analysts still see stocks as an attractive place to put money.</p><p>\"Futures looked a little bit dreary this morning,\" said Jeff Mortimer, director of investment strategy at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. But, he said: \"Buyers have come in to take some of the dip.\"</p><p>Technology and consumer staples stocks helped support the market, with Microsoft shares gaining 2.1% and Costco Wholesale shares adding 1.8%.</p><p>Shares of Bath &amp; Body Works rose 10.5% after the retailer beat analysts' earnings expectations for the second quarter.</p><p>In one bright sign for the economy, fresh data showed that jobless claims fell to a pandemic low of 348,000 last week, suggesting the labor market continues to heal. New jobless claims are down more than 50% since January.</p><p>Broadly, though, investors moved out of assets that are particularly sensitive to the global economic recovery, and into those seen as more sheltered. Government bonds rallied, pushing down yields. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note slid to 1.247% from 1.273% Wednesday. Yields fall as bond prices rise.</p><p>Minutes of the Fed's July meeting, published Wednesday, revealed an emerging consensus to scale back $120 billion in monthly asset purchases this year. The minutes said several officials favored reducing asset purchases in the coming months to position the Fed to potentially raise interest rates if the economy strengthens further next year.</p><p>Paring back stimulus efforts that have helped stocks and other assets soar since the spring of 2020 is likely to cause some volatility, investors say.</p><p>Lyn Graham-Taylor, senior rates strategist at Rabobank, said the Fed struck a surprisingly cautious tone, and that this may have contributed to the downbeat mood in markets. For example, he said, the minutes made several references to risks posed by the Delta variant to the economic recovery.</p><p>A stronger dollar weighed on commodities, adding to pressure stemming from forecasts that China's economic slowdown will weigh on demand for industrial materials. Brent crude fell 2.6% to $66.45 a barrel, while copper dropped 1.9%.</p><p>Overseas markets followed Wall Street lower. The Stoxx Europe 600 slid 1.5%. Chinese technology stocks sold off, led by some of the country's Internet giants, after two government ministries said they were likely to impose additional regulations on the sector. The broader Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.6% by the close of trading.</p><p>The Hong Kong-listed shares of Alibaba Group Holding tumbled 5.5% to their lowest close since their secondary listing in November 2019, while shares of food-delivery giant Meituan dropped 7.2%. The city's flagship Hang Seng Index ended 2.1% lower on Thursday.</p><p>Regulators in China are still working through their tech-sector changes, and investors can't see light at the end of the tunnel, said Justin Tang, Head of Asian Research at United First Partners in Singapore. \"And when the reform ends, the growth will not be as explosive as the good old days,\" he added.</p><p>Elsewhere, Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 1.1%.</p><p>Chong Koh Ping in Singapore contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at Joe.Wallace@wsj.com and Karen Langley at karen.langley@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks End Mixed After Bumpy Trading Day</p>",
