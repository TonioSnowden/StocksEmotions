We've been in contact with the winners and hope you enjoy the film.</p> <p>In today's newsletter:</p> <ul>  <li><p>Chanos bets against data centres</p></li>  <li><p>Inside the demise of Missfresh</p></li> </ul> <h1>Chanos challenges private equity's data centre spree</h1> <p><strong>Jim Chanos</strong> has a decent record of well-timed bets, among them <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f72e8bc-fafd-4ede-a418-22904e6d5b5f\">gleaning $100mn</a> from the downfall of <strong>Wirecard</strong> and spotting irregularities at <strong>Enron</strong>.</p> <p>That's not to say that he's always right, however. &#xa0;</p> <p>Assets at the 64-year-old's hedge fund <strong>Kynikos Associates</strong>, which was burnt by a longstanding bet against <strong>Tesla</strong>, have fallen from a peak of $7bn at the end of 2008 to under $1bn. And this latest one is a bit of a head scratcher.</p> <p>The “catastrophe capitalist” is raising several <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e89e7071-0f1d-4bea-a857-a6fce236d776\">hundred million dollars</a> for a fund that will take short positions in US data centre groups — a move that pits him against some of the world's biggest private equity groups. </p> <p>The FT's Anna Gross has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b701215b-9c05-475a-921c-7d5fc5a0c0cd\">dug into the details</a> of what Chanos says is his “big short right now”.</p> <p>The way Chanos sees it, bricks-and-mortar real estate investment trusts such as <strong>Equinix </strong>and <strong>Digital Realty </strong>will become increasingly obsolete as tech behemoths such as <strong>Amazon, Google </strong>and <strong>Microsoft </strong>build their own data centres rather than leasing out space in existing ones. </p> <p>Cash-rich Big Tech groups can build more cheaply, making independent real estate investment trusts — with their older technology — redundant, he argues. </p> <p>This bet puts the veteran short seller at odds with private equity titans who've poured billions into data centre groups on the view that traditional players will maintain their grip over the land, labour and energy resources required to run massive data warehouses.</p> <p><strong>Blackstone Group</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-to-buy-data-center-operator-qts-realty-trust-for-6-7-billion-11623063600?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos1\">bought</a> Kansas-headquartered <strong>QTS Realty Trust</strong> for $10bn last year while <strong>KKR </strong>and <strong>GI Partners</strong> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/kkr-global-infrastructure-partners-buy-cyrusone-15-bln-deal-2021-11-15/\">acquired Texas-based <strong>CyrusOne</strong></a> for $15bn in March. </p> <p><strong>Jon Gray</strong>, Blackstone's president and chief operating officer, has repeatedly cited data centres as an important investment theme for the US buyouts giant. </p> <p>But Chanos derided the transactions as “rash”, with valuations that were “stretched by any measure”, and predicted a “post-takeover hangover”.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10877016.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Silicon Valley seems to have backed private equity's theory. Tech groups including <strong>Meta</strong>, Microsoft, <strong>ByteDance</strong> and <strong>Twitter</strong> have made a noticeable shift towards greater leasing over the past six months, reversing a previous trend towards greater in-house construction.</p> <p>“There's a fallacy in the argument that we're not growing as fast as the cloud providers which means we are threatened by them,” said<strong> Andy Power</strong>, president and chief financial officer at Digital Realty.</p> <p>For now, soaring demand for cloud services mean Big Tech groups will continue to grow their own data footprints while still relying on established data groups for sought-after real estate.</p> <p>But supply and demand dictate that the equilibrium won't last for ever. </p> <p>“Right now there is an undersupply, but it's going to be like oil prices: everyone is going to drill, drill, drill,” said <strong>David Friend</strong>, chief executive of cloud storage group <strong>Wasabi</strong>. “And then it will force prices down until there's greater consolidation in the market.”</p> <h1>JPMorgan and the grocery app IPO that didn't deliver</h1> <p>In 2019, as Wall Street executives fell over themselves to woo<strong> Adam Neumann </strong>and his cash-burning start-up <strong>WeWork</strong>, it was <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>'s<strong> Jamie Dimon</strong> who ultimately secured the coveted lead advisory role on the company's planned initial public offering, with the Wall Street bank pitching a valuation of up to $63bn.</p> <p>DD readers remember the rest: investors baulked, the float was cancelled, and WeWork went public in a $9bn Spac deal two years later — a fraction of its mooted value. </p> <p>Still, JPMorgan appears not to have fully learned its lesson on hyped-up but unprofitable start-ups. Let's look at its client <strong>Missfresh</strong>, the Chinese grocery delivery group that collapsed last month. </p> <p>Missfresh raised money from a fund set up by California real estate mogul <strong>Carl Chang</strong>'s company, <strong>Kairos Investment Management</strong>, at a $3.5bn valuation shortly before the start-up's IPO in June 2021. </p> <p>“JPMorgan mentioned on our exclusive call last week they believe conservatively the value [is] around $12B,” Chang texted one investor in May 2021. </p> <p>One of its bankers explained the valuation by saying Missfresh's delivery segment deserved a similar valuation multiple as <strong>Amazon</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e2ed2e4-d954-4f33-9656-143ea940e44c\">according to this deep-dive</a> by the FT's Ryan McMorrow, Nian Liu and Gloria Li. </p> <p>But, even based on the $3.5bn figure, Kairos was underwater before it began trading publicly: it went public on the<strong> Nasdaq</strong> at a valuation of just $3bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now, the picture is looking much worse. Missfresh told employees last month that it had run out of cash and couldn't pay salaries. Its stock has fallen to about 12 cents. </p> <p>Missfresh is now facing lawsuits from investors. A complaint filed in US district court in New York last month alleged Missfresh provided false financial figures in its IPO prospectus.</p> <p>JPMorgan and fellow underwriter <strong>Citigroup</strong> declined to comment. Missfresh said the IPO process and all of its investor communications were compliant with regulations. </p> <p>Missfresh won investment from funds run by <strong>Tiger Global</strong> and <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> as it pioneered speedy grocery delivery in China, with mini-warehouses and pink-clad riders and a claim that it could make 30-minute delivery profitable. </p> <p>It had become a symbol of a new generation of tech start-ups in the country — at least before Beijing's crackdown on the tech sector. There are many differences between Missfresh and WeWork, but both episodes show the dangers of getting too caught up in the hype.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Initialized Capital </strong>founder <strong>Garry Tan </strong>is returning to venture capital group <strong>Y Combinator</strong>, where he previously worked as a partner, to succeed <strong>Geoff Ralston</strong> as president and chief executive.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Nomura </strong>has named <strong>Andrei Milekhin</strong>, previously the bank's head of telecoms and digital infrastructure investment banking for emerging markets, as global head of digital infrastructure.
