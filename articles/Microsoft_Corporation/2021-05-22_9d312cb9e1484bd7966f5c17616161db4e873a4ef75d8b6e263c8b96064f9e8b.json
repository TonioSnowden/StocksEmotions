  "text": "<p>   Reed Hundt was the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission during the Clinton administration, when the internet and mobile phones were just starting to take off. He now runs the Coalition for Green Capital, which helps start so-called green banks that fund alternative energy. He sees parallels to the earlier era in the scale and the pace of change that is occurring in the energy industry. </p><p>   \"These are profound economic shifts,\" he said. The wave of investment, he said, will drive down prices and accelerate the transition from fossil fuels. \"The direction set by the market is to go to the cheapest possible fuels -- which are wind and sun,\" he said. </p><p>   ReNew Power, one of India's largest renewable-energy companies, is expected to raise $1.2 billion through a U.S. SPAC deal. ReNew has borrowed $1.4 billion since late last year at rates lower than what it paid before. The company plans to more than triple its wind and solar capacity by 2025, said Chief Executive Sumant Sinha. </p><p>   ReNew expects revenue, which was about $680 million in the year ending in March, to surge as the energy market grows in India, one of the world's largest polluters. Over the next two decades, India is expected to add electricity generation capacity equivalent to what exists today in the European Union, according to the IEA. </p><p>   Companies and governments issued nearly $315 billion in green and sustainable bonds and other debt securities in the first quarter, more than triple the figure from a year earlier, according to the Institute of International Finance. Investors are willing to pay a premium for such bonds, in comparison to conventional bonds. That \"greenium\" pushes up bond prices and drives down yields, lowering borrowing costs. </p><p>   Banks, which for years have been major funders of fossil-fuel companies, see increased financial and reputational risks in those industries. In April, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. pledged $2.5 trillion over the next decade for environmental and social causes, including direct funding for wind and solar projects and assistance for clean-energy firms raising money. Bank of America Corp. said it hopes to mobilize and deploy $1.5 trillion in the sector by 2030. </p><p>   \"Today, banks fight over funding every wind and solar deal,\" said Jigar Shah, the new head of the federal Energy Department's Loan Programs Office, which oversees more than $40 billion in federal financing for clean energy projects. </p><p>   Mr. Shah, formerly president of San Francisco sustainable-infrastructure company Generate Capital Inc., said in early May that the Energy Department's loan office has had more than 130 formal consultations with businesses -- the final step before an applicant files for a loan -- since he took the job in March. He says he expects to have about 10 deals approved by August. </p><p>   The loan office was criticized a decade ago after the failure of Solyndra, a California solar company it had backed, Mr. Shah points to successes, such as Tesla, which received a $465 million loan in 2010 that helped it accelerate production of the Model S and build a factory in California. </p><p>   At the time, Tesla was a risky startup. Now, it is the most valuable auto maker in the world, with a market value of about $560 billion. The company repaid the loan ahead of schedule in 2013. </p><p>   Tesla's soaring stock helped ignite an investing frenzy around electric cars and batteries, and it has boosted the performance of many sustainable-investment funds, attracting more cash to the sector. Mr. Shah said the government can play an important role by backing early-stage companies, which draws in other investors. </p><p>   Critics of such public-private investment plans say they can drive away private-sector capital because the government typically has the most senior loan, making it first to get repaid in the event of default. Another common criticism, that the government doesn't have the expertise to assess risky startups, is one reason the loan-office job went to Mr. Shah, who spent much of his career making such assessments. </p><p>   The Biden administration's proposed $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan would expand subsidies through tax credits. Another administration proposal, the Clean Energy and Sustainability Accelerator Act, would provide $100 billion in funding for projects in renewable power, grid infrastructure and reforestation. </p><p>   Alphabet Inc.'s Google committed to getting power from clean-energy sources around the clock by 2030. By signing upfront agreements with utilities to purchase clean energy, Google is helping them get better financing terms for their projects, said Michael Terrell, Google's head of energy. </p><p>   Microsoft Corp. last year said it planned to offset all its carbon emissions since Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded it in 1975. Microsoft President Brad Smith said the company realized several years ago that the business case for investing in renewables had become stronger. </p><p>   \"This is where the world is going,\" he said. \"It's where regulators are going. It's where customers and investors are going.\" </p><p></p>",
