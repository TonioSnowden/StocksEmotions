  "title": "Rise of Remote Work Poses  Questions on Taxes and Pay  ----  By Chip Cutter and Emily Glazer",
  "text": "<p>   Companies are anticipating another largely remote work year, and new questions about compensation and benefits are weighing on managers. </p><p>   Discussions about the future of work, such as whether to reduce the salaries of employees who have left high-cost cities, are priority items in board meetings and senior executive sessions across industries, according to chief executives, board members and corporate advisers. </p><p>   Among the questions companies are trying to resolve: Who should shoulder tax costs as employees move to new locations while working remotely? And what is the most effective way to support working parents? </p><p>   Companies say there is much at stake, from the happiness and productivity of employees to regulatory consequences, if they get these decisions wrong. </p><p>   Employees' relocations to new cities, states and countries have companies and workers grappling with tax concerns. </p><p>   Facebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees last year that, beginning in January, the company would use its virtual private network, or VPN, that employees use to access company systems to determine where they were working for tax purposes. </p><p>   At issue is whether workers who told Facebook they left locations such as California and New York -- and therefore shouldn't pay state and local income tax -- had really moved, according to a person familiar with the matter. Also, if an employee has moved to another state or city where there are local income taxes, both the company and worker could be held accountable for not paying them. </p><p>   Facebook ultimately decided against tracking employees' locations based on their VPN usage. The company now says that when its workers request -- and are approved for -- long-term remote work, they must confirm their new location with the company, as it could affect their taxes. Facebook also said some remote workers' salaries might be changed if they live in a location with a different cost of labor than their previous location. </p><p>   Ride-sharing service Lyft Inc. recently told its U.S.-based employees that staffers must work from one of Lyft's 36 registered states for tax purposes based on where Lyft's corporate entity is registered. If an employee is living outside of states where Lyft is registered as a corporate entity, such as in Maine or Wyoming, they have until March 31 to move back to one, according to an internal email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   As well, if Lyft workers plan to live outside the state they worked in before the Covid-19 pandemic began for 60 days or longer, they have to submit a form before March 31 so that the company can tax them in that new state -- but they can only submit this request once. </p><p>   Companies such as payments firm Stripe Inc. have offered employees leaving San Francisco, New York or Seattle the chance to relocate for a one-time bonus of $20,000 if they agree to a salary cut of up to 10%. Others, such as Microsoft Corp., have indicated that benefits and pay may change based on the company's compensation scale by location. </p><p>   A number of Fortune 500 companies across industries are considering potential pay changes if an employee relocates from a city like San Francisco to Texas, says Jimmy Etheredge, North America CEO at consulting firm Accenture PLC. </p><p>   \"Almost all of them have a cost-of-living element in their compensation,\" he says. \"As they're thinking through this future of work that may involve more remote working, that may involve talent in places that they did not necessarily have before, they will look to make adjustments.\" </p><p>   Other tech companies are continuing to pay people the same regardless of ZIP Code. Spotify Technology SA, the audiostreaming company based in Sweden, recently told its employees, which it calls \"band members,\" that they could work from anywhere within their assigned country and maintain their same pay. </p><p>   \"When you move, we will not change that,\" Katarina Berg, Spotify's chief HR officer, said. The company, with 6,500 full-time employees, will adopt national salary ranges for each jobbased on compensation at competing companies and set by the prevailing pay in high-cost cities such as San Francisco or New York. </p><p>   The prolonged remote spell is putting pressure on companies to give parents more help with child care -- while being careful not to rankle workers without dependents. Some companies, such as Palo Alto Networks Inc., offers workers an allowance of $1,000 that can be applied to a menu of options. </p><p></p>",
