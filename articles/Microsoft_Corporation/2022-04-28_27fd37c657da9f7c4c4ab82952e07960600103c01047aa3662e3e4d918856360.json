  "text": "<p>The dollar's Thursday ascent marks the latest win for the greenback, which has risen for all but two of April's 20 trading sessions, and put the currency within striking distance of a 20-year high. The WSJ Dollar Index rose as high as 97.33 in March 2020 on an intraday basis—1.2% higher than where it is now. Any jump past that would be the index's highest level since 2002.</p><p>The dollar's strength has been one of the few bright spots in this year's markets, which have otherwise seen stock and bond prices battered by inflation, geopolitical concerns and worries about interest-rate increases from the Federal Reserve.</p><p>The dollar tends to perform well when investors ditch riskier investments and seek shelter in assets that they perceive as safer. Its status as the world's reserve currency makes the dollar a particularly attractive haven.</p><p>Higher rates also typically support the dollar by making U.S. assets more attractive to yield-seeking investors. Investors expect that the Fed will increase interest rates aggressively this year to combat soaring inflation. That compares to the Bank of Japan, which reinforced Thursday its commitment to low interest rates despite rising inflation. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, will continue to lag behind the Fed in tightening monetary policy, ECB President Christine Lagarde said earlier this month.</p><p>The dollar rose 0.7% against the euro Thursday, sending the euro dipping below $1.05, its lowest level since 2017. The greenback also advanced 1.1% against the British pound to a nearly two-year high.</p><p>Meanwhile, the dollar rose sharply against the yen, gaining 2.1%. That sent the yen weakening to more than 130 to the dollar for the first time since April 2002. The yen has fallen dramatically recently and is currently down 12% for the year.</p><p>\"When two of the biggest central banks in the world are maintaining easy monetary policy on a relative basis versus the Fed, those rate differentials…are a huge part of the dollar's strength,\" said Charlie McElligott, a cross-asset macro strategist at Nomura Securities International.</p><p>The war in Ukraine, rising Covid-19 cases in China and expectations that U.S. growth will outperform the rest of the world have also boosted the dollar, investors and analysts say. That has been a boon to investors who entered the year with bullish positioning on the dollar. The WSJ Dollar Index is up 7.4% year to date, outpacing gold, another haven asset, which is up 3.2% for the year. The S&amp;P 500, in contrast, has tumbled 12%.</p><p>Yet a strong dollar also has implications for global economies and markets. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 generate roughly 40% of their revenue from outside the U.S., FactSet data show, and a strong dollar makes it more expensive for companies to bring home foreign sales. Already this earnings season, companies including Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have mentioned the negative impact of a strong dollar on results.</p><p>A strengthening dollar also tends to weigh heavily on emerging markets. By pushing down the value of emerging-market currencies, a rising dollar makes dollar-denominated debt more expensive for them to repay. On Thursday, the dollar jumped against emerging-market currencies, cutting further into the gains that somenotched earlier this year. The greenback rose 1% against the Brazilian real, 1.3% against the Chilean peso and 1.1% against the South African rand.</p><p>The pace of the dollar's rise this year has surprised some analysts and investors and has already begun to reset expectations for the rest of the year.</p><p>\"I am this week doubting my view that the dollar would give back some of its gains, and I am beginning to fear that we will have a stronger dollar for longer this year,\" said Jane Foley, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Rabobank. \"The global economic conditions that will lead to [a stronger dollar] are not pretty. We're talking about Europe's [economy] under potential pressure and the greater possibility of a lack of energy supply to Germany. We're talking about slower growth in China.\"</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Dollar Surges Amid Investor Jitters, Rising Yields</p>",
