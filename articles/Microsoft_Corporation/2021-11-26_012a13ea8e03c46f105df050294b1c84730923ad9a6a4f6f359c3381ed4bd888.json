  "text": "<p>Shoppers entered the season seeing more out-of-stock messages than ever before, according to Adobe Analytics, which measures 80 of the top 100 U.S. e-commerce sites. Electronics are facing the most significant shortages, primarily due to the continuing global chip crisis.</p><p>In fact, many of the season's most popular items are already selling out.</p><p>Some new Google Pixel phone models are out of stock, according to the company's website. Sony's PlayStation 5 gaming consoles have been hard to come by since its debut last fall. Microsoft's Xbox Series minifridge sold out in a matter of minutes.</p><p>So what should you do if you really need a gift for the techie in your life?</p><p>It depends how much of a risk you're willing to take. If you can't show up without the hot-ticket items, there are ways to try to get them—they just might cost you more money or time. If you're more about function than the latest model, consider a close competitor or older model. And if the gadget you're after looks like it will arrive in 2022, stand-in gifts could buy you some time.</p><p>Here's how to approach your final stretch of tech gift shopping.</p><p>Be patient and persistent</p><p>Not everything is sold out, and some in-demand items will likely get restocked in December, said Taylor Schreiner, director of Adobe Digital Insights, which analyzes online shopping transactions.</p><p>Last December, Adobe identified several restocks of Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5—both brand new—at Walmart, and another restock of the new Xbox at Target a week before Christmas.</p><p>But finding those wishlist items will likely take more time, persistence and patience this year, shopping specialists say.</p><p>Apps and websites such as BrickSeek and HotStock.io can help you check if a product is in stock across a bevy of retailers. If the item is sold out, they also let you set up alerts for when a product is back in stock at Walmart, Target and a long list of other stores.</p><p>\"Those apps will give you an idea if something is being restocked at all and can show you whether you should have hope of getting it,\" said Michelle Madhok, an online shopping specialist and founder of the deals website SheFinds.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Have you been able to find all the tech gifts you want? If not, what are your substitutions? Join the conversation below.</p><p>You might need to make a trip to the retailer, where staff can let you know what's in stock, and what could be on its way, said Samantha Brown, a personal shopper in New York City.</p><p>\"I know it's a drag, but if you get out and go into the store, you might have an interaction that sets you up for a smarter purchase.\"</p><p>Find the next best thing</p><p>Opting for an alternative is a tricky art. The last thing you want to do is buy your loved ones something they won't use, or something that pales in comparison to what they asked for.</p><p>\"I remember being a kid and my mom getting me the fake Barbie doll,\" Ms. Madhok said. \"No one wants the fake Barbie doll.\"</p><p>Most in-demand tech items have competing gadgets, which a quick Google search should reveal. If your kid can't wait to get the PS5, consider an Oculus Quest 2 virtual-reality headset as a placeholder. If you can't get a Nintendo Switch, consider an iPad or iPod Touch.</p><p>If you're still uncertain, look at what the person you're shopping for is posting on social media or saving to their Pinterest board.</p><p>You might also look for older-generation devices that could save you money and still win them over.</p><p>Apple Watch Series 7 won't arrive in time? Go for Series 6 or even Series 5. Apple's latest smartwatch series comes with a slightly larger display, but most of the upgrades are tiny and barely noticeable to average users. Similarly, Apple's new iPhone 13 is an incremental step above last year's iPhone 12.</p><p>Buy used or refurbished</p><p>You should practice discretion whenever combing through online marketplaces for refurbished or used goods, but you could also find some gems if you're willing to pay.</p><p>This year's most sought-after gaming systems, the PS5 and Xbox Series X, have cropped up on eBay at more than double the cost. The website lets users search for \"finished listings,\" showing how much similar items previously sold for.</p><p>\"You can use the metric to see what the demand is, and gauge what you're willing to spend,\" Ms. Madhok said.</p><p>Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist are also tempting contenders for secondhand tech, but going with a vendor offering a 30-day return policy, such as Amazon's Warehouse Deals or GameStop's refurbished channels, is a safer route, the experts say.</p><p>And for many tech products, such as earbuds, computers, networking devices and more, you're probably better off with a factory refurbished product sold by its original maker. Apple, Dell, HP and others sell their own merchandise at varying discounts.</p><p>Embrace the IOU</p><p>Shopping for tech gifts can become a waiting game. \"From a tech standpoint, people are probably going to get the product; it's just going to be delayed,\" said Steven Carnovale, an assistant professor of supply chain management at the Rochester Institute of Technology.</p><p>Translation: Put your order in but don't hold your breath waiting for it to arrive.</p><p>So if it's a gift that's delayed until the New Year, how do you buy time?</p><p>You can wrap a gift card that allows your recipient to purchase games for the soon-to-arrive device. If it's an iPhone, an Apple gift card works. The same thing would work for Android devices and Google's Play store. In August, Microsoft released an Xbox Game Pass giving gamers access to dozens of titles, and it's accessible on PCs and other devices for $15 a month.</p><p>\"This is going to be the year of subscription gifts and cards,\" Ms. Madhok said. \"That's one way to make sure everybody will get something.\"</p><p>For more WSJ Technology analysis, reviews, advice and headlines, sign up for our weekly newsletter.</p><p>Write to Dalvin Brown at dalvin.brown@wsj.com</p><p>Tech Gifts Sold Out Before the Holidays.
