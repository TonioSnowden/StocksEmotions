  "text": "<p>The former prime ministers of Italy and Finland and the ex-chancellor of Austria resigned from the boards of Russian companies on Thursday following Vladimir Putin's full <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07bbc5c7-e620-4734-83b5-7bb261363c35\">military invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p> <p>Matteo Renzi, the former prime minister of Italy and a senator for the centrist Italia Viva party, walked away from Delimobil, Russia's largest car-sharing service, founded by Italian businessman Vincenzo Trani, in response to Russia's military action.</p> <p>Renzi told the Financial Times he emailed Delimobil's board of directors on Thursday morning to communicate his resignation with immediate effect. </p> <p>Esko Aho, the former prime minister of Finland, quit the board of Russia's largest bank, Sberbank, where he served for six years as an independent director and member of the supervisory board. Aho said it was his personal choice that had nothing to do with the bank.</p> <p>“It's my personal decision, my personal conclusion,” he said. “I saw the challenges in my role because of the sanctions, it's obvious that it will be difficult to be an active participant in this operation.”</p> <p>Sberbank declined to comment on his decision. </p> <p>Christian Kern, Austria's former chancellor, said he had resigned from the board of Russian Railways (RZD) on Thursday morning with immediate effect.</p> <p>“RZD had now actually become part of Russian war logistics,” Kern told the Austrian newspaper Der Standard, adding: “I deeply regret this . . . My thoughts are with the victims of this senseless aggression.”</p> <p>Ernesto Ferlenghi, the chief of Eni in Russia, on Thursday resigned from his role as a board member of Federal Grid, the operator and manager of Russia's unified electricity transmission grid system, a spokesperson for the Italian oil company told the FT.</p> <p>The resignations underline the pressure on members of the western business and political elite who sit on corporate boards of Russian groups, as President Vladimir Putin launched what could be the biggest military operation in Europe since the second world war.</p> <p>Other former European politicians and public officials with ties to Russian corporate boards include Germany's former chancellor Gerhard Schröder, who sits on the board of Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft and has been nominated to join the board of Gazprom, the Russian gas supplier. </p> <p>Schröder said on LinkedIn that the war must be ended as soon as possible. “That's the responsibility of the Russian government,” he said.</p> <p>The former German chancellor said there had been “many mistakes” made in the relationship between Russia and the west “on both sides” but, he added, “even Russian security interests do not justify the use of military means”.</p> <p>He said sanctions were necessary, but “the remaining political, economic and civil society connections that exist between Europe and Russia” should not be broken. “Despite the dramatic situation we have today, these connections are the basis for the hope we all have: that a dialogue about peace and security on our continent will once again be possible,” he said. </p> <p>François Fillon, France's former prime minister, sits on the board of petrochemicals group Sibur and state oil group Zarubezhneft. Fillon said in a statement on Thursday that he condemned the use of force in Ukraine, but added that he had also warned for years that the west was not taking Russian concerns over Nato's expansion seriously enough. </p> <p>“This attitude has led us today to a dangerous confrontation that could have been avoided,” Fillon said. He praised recent French diplomatic efforts on Russia and said they should continue. </p> <p>Karin Kneissl, a former Austrian foreign minister, sits on the board of Rosneft. </p> <p>Trani, the founder of Delimobil, is also the head of the Italy-Russia chamber of commerce, the group that promoted a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da18b7ef-467a-415e-ae3e-07afaf812543\">meeting</a> between Putin and top Italian business leaders last month. The car-sharing company was set to go public at the end of last year but the listing was postponed because of the rising geopolitical tensions. </p> <p>Western executives, including BP chief executive Bernard Looney and Nord Stream 2 chief Matthias Warnig also sit on Russian corporate boards.</p> <p>Looney is a director of Rosneft, as is Bob Dudley, the former chief executive of BP. </p> <p>Warnig is the chair of the board of Transneft, the gas pipeline operator, and is a member of the supervisory board of VTB Bank. </p> <p>Lord Barker of Battle, a climate minister under former UK prime minister David Cameron, runs Rusal's parent company En+.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting from Neil Hume and Tom Wilson in London, Richard Milne in Oslo, Erika Solomon and Guy Chazan in Berlin, and Sarah White in Paris</em></p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/0853bc04-2a6e-4a4b-ab73-c6b52f89d55a.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli in Milan and Nastassia Astrasheuskaya in Moscow 2022 'Former European leaders resign from Russian corporate boards' FT.com 24 February.
