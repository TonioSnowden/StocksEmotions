  "text": "<p>Arne Sorenson, the chief executive of Marriott, died unexpectedly aged 62 at his home in Washington on Monday after a prolonged battle with cancer. </p> <p>Sorenson, who had led the hotel group since 2012, revealed that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in May 2019 and announced earlier this month that he would be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29720032-fe35-473d-a9f1-bc64eb84bfb0\">stepping back</a> from the daily running of the company as he undertook demanding medical care.</p> <p>He said at the time that once he returned to health he planned to come back to the business full-time. </p> <p>Marriott said the company was “shocked and devastated” by his death.</p> <p>“Arne was an exceptional executive — but more than that — he was an exceptional human being,” said Bill Marriott Jr, Marriott's executive chairman. “Arne loved every aspect of this business and relished time spent touring our hotels and meeting associates around the world. He had an uncanny ability to anticipate where the hospitality industry was headed and position Marriott for growth.”</p> <p>Stephanie Linnartz, Marriott's group president of consumer operations, and Tony Capuano, group president of global development, who had stepped in to cover for Sorenson while he took medical leave, will continue to run the business until a new chief executive is found. </p> <p>The company is battling the repercussions of ongoing closures across its 7,500 hotel portfolio owing to the pandemic. It said it expected to announce the appointment within the next two weeks. </p> <p>Sorenson won acclaim for his empathetic response to the pandemic crisis that struck the hotel industry, forcing Marriott to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df2ed112-6878-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3\">furlough thousands</a> of employees.&#xa0;In an emotional, six-minute video released last March he said Covid-19 had hit the company harder than the Great Depression or second world war and announced that he would take no salary for the rest of 2020.</p> <p>Sorenson was the first Marriott boss not to come from the Marriott family. He joined the business in 1996 having previously practised as a deals lawyer with the law firm Latham &amp; Watkins.</p> <p>He held several positions at Marriott before taking the top job, where he oversaw the group's $13.6bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a34b554-ef5c-11e5-9f20-c3a047354386\">acquisition</a> of Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts in 2016, making Marriott the largest hotel group in the world by number of rooms.</p> <p>Sorenson also sat on the board of Microsoft, was a trustee of the Brookings Institution and played a prominent role in representing business interests in Washington as a member of the Business Roundtable. He is survived by his wife and four children.</p> <p>His death drew tributes from colleagues, competitors and fellow business leaders including GM chief executive Mary Barra and Cisco chief Chuck Robbins. Doug McMillon, Walmart's chief executive, remembered Sorenson as a bold, compassionate, “best-in-class business leader”, while Josh Bolten, chief executive of the Business Roundtable, praised his “relentless focus” on workers' wellbeing.</p> <p>Political leaders in Maryland, where Marriott is based, hailed his contributions to the community, including participating in governor Larry Hogan's coronavirus recovery task force as he battled his illness. </p><p>Source: Alice Hancock and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson 2021 'Marriott chief Arne Sorenson dies aged 62' FT.com 16 February.
