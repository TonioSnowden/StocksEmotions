  "text": "<p>\"It wasn't meant to be casting a judgment or making a decision for people on what they thought was their worth from a liquidity perspective,\" Mr. Bankman-Fried said.</p><p>The four tokens taken from Alameda were listed as assets in documents dated Nov. 10, Mr. Bankman-Fried said in an interview Friday and according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. By then, the value of the tokens had roughly halved in less than a week, market data and FTX's balance sheet show.</p><p>The seizure of the tokens as collateral partially explains the multibillion-dollar cash shortfall that led to the bankruptcy at FTX. Alameda borrowed billions of dollars from FTX, and when FTX called the loans, the collateral was worth far less than needed. It also highlights Mr. Bankman-Fried's strategy of launching tokens and using them to raise money.</p><p>The tokens follow the same pattern Mr. Bankman-Fried used for FTX's own token, FTT, which played a big role in the company's collapse.</p><p>FTX and Alameda controlled most of FTT, which helped them raise and borrow billions of dollars. FTX faced a run by customers after a report showed that an outsize chunk of Alameda's assets was made up of FTT and that it might have overvalued the token.</p><p>The four tokens seized as collateral by FTX were part of a plan by Mr. Bankman-Fried and his associates to draw in large numbers of potential new traders to their crypto-trading ecosystem. One, called Serum, was designed to be a crypto exchange that automatically matched buyers and sellers. A second token, Bonfida, backed a project to create trading tools for Serum. Alameda funded both projects.</p><p>Tokens from two other firms -- Oxygen, a brokerage that lent money to traders, and Maps.me, an offline mapping service that planned to bring in customers using a wallet in the app -- also were connected to Serum and backed by Alameda.</p><p>The ecosystem Mr. Bankman-Fried envisioned is crumbling without the support of Alameda and FTX. The day before FTX filed for bankruptcy, the value of Serum, Bonfida, Maps and Oxygen tokens were in free fall, cutting the value of those assets on the exchange's balance sheet by more than half to $2.9 billion.</p><p>Serum and three other tokens didn't appear on FTX's balance sheet until November, when it claimed funds Alameda used for collateral after the trading firm ran out of cash, Mr. Bankman-Fried said.</p><p>Two-thirds of all possible Serum coins were held by FTX and Alameda. Much of the trading in Serum was driven by Alameda. Oxygen and Maps.me said in a statement after the bankruptcies that FTX and Alameda held 95% of all of their tokens. The liquidity dried up after the bankruptcies.</p><p>Serum, launched with help from Mr. Bankman-Fried in mid-2020, was supposed to be an autonomous decentralized crypto exchange, governed by its users, not FTX, the platform's documentation says. Instead of depositing funds with a centralized exchange like FTX, bots would automatically facilitate trades between buyers and sellers.</p><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried helped promote Serum. He said in the interview that he likes to support projects like these, especially when he knows the founders. He hired at least one person to respond to Telegram messages where users discussed issues, while a public-relations firm that promoted FTX also helped market the new exchange, according to employees.</p><p>Before long, Serum seemed to be thriving. In September 2021, each of its tokens traded as high as $12.50, driving the value of its tokens to more than $127 billion -- though only a tiny fraction were actually trading.</p><p>In January, Serum's backers announced they had raised $100 million from 18 investors. By February, the platform was handling nearly $1 billion in transaction volumes a day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko -- making it the third-largest such exchange in the world at the time.</p><p>But in reality, FTX employees still had control. They held the credentials allowing coders to make changes to the platform, according to two people familiar with the project's development and a Journal review of Telegram chat logs.</p><p>Serum's links to FTX, Alameda and Mr. Bankman-Fried were known in the crypto world. When heavily traded currencies bitcoin and Ethereum were dropping in value, financial-services firm Blockchain.com pulled loans from Alameda, according to people familiar with the matter. It wouldn't accept other coins such as Serum on the company's balance sheet because of their close ties to Mr. Bankman-Fried.</p><p>The tokens were also red flags for Olaf Carlson-Wee, founder of the cryptocurrency fund Polychain Capital. Mr. Carlson-Wee said in a tweet that his firm was given 24 hours by Mr. Bankman-Fried to decide whether to invest. He repeatedly declined in part because of concerns that the Serum and FTT tokens as well as those issued by Oxygen and Maps.me were overvalued.</p><p>Together, the Maps.me and Oxygen tokens raised $90 million. Mr. Bankman-Fried was an adviser to both projects and Alameda an investor.</p><p>Both Oxygen and Maps were led by two men, Alex Grebnev and Viktor Mangazeev. Mr. Mangazeev said in a LinkedIn message that he ended his involvement in the projects in February. Mr. Grebnev didn't respond to emails seeking comment.</p><p>Maps.me was owned by the Russian internet conglomerate Mail.ru Group, now called VK Co., and in late 2020 the project was sold to a Cyprus-registered firm, according to a news release, before the token was announced. \"We would rather not elaborate on products and related plans which are no longer applicable to the group,\" a VK spokeswoman said.</p>",
