  "title": "TikTok Hires Panasonic Executive to Expand Compliance Function; Catherine Razzano will oversee legal compliance issues at the social-media company, as its popular video-sharing app faces scrutiny in the U.S. over potential security risks",
  "text": "<p>TikTok, which is owned by Chinese technology giant ByteDance Ltd., has been under pressure by U.S. lawmakers who view the app as a threat to U.S. national security and a means for the Chinese government to steal individual Americans' personal data. The Biden administration is crafting regulations that would significantly expand federal oversight of foreign-owned apps such as TikTok.</p><p>The social-media company has said repeatedly that it doesn't share information on American users with the Chinese government, and that its data is held on servers in the U.S. with backup servers in Singapore.</p><p>Ms. Razzano in an email said she would help TikTok expand its compliance function as the company continues to grow rapidly. The app, known for its viral dance videos, was the internet's most visited site in 2021, according to Cloudflare Inc., a cloud-infrastructure company that tracks internet traffic.</p><p>She said she would be based in Los Angeles and would report to Matt Penarczyk, a former Microsoft Corp. executive who is now TikTok's top legal executive in the Americas.</p><p>Ms. Razzano joined TikTok from Panasonic Avionics Corp., where she was hired in 2018 to help the company strengthen its compliance systems while it was under independent oversight following an investigation into violations of U.S. antibribery law.</p><p>TikTok faces a number of concerns, some with legal compliance implications, over data privacy and the app's potential to negatively affect younger users.</p><p>The U.S. Commerce Department last year proposed a rule covering apps that could be used by \"foreign adversaries to steal or otherwise obtain data,\" according to a filing in the Federal Register.</p><p>The proposed rule, which is in the process of being revised, would allow the commerce secretary to effectively bar foreign apps deemed unacceptable security risks. It could force social-media platforms such as TikTok and other software applications connected to the internet to submit to third-party auditing, source-code examination and the monitoring of the logs that show user data, according to the proposed rule.</p><p>TikTok has also faced scrutiny alongside its social-media peers, in particular Meta Platforms Inc.'s Instagram, over the potential psychological harm it can cause users.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal in July published an investigation that illustrated how TikTok's algorithm could push users browsing the app's For You feed, its highly personalized home page serving up an endless stream of content, into rabbit holes of content that can be hard for some to escape. In a follow-up investigation published in September, the Journal showed how young users were being pushed into spools of content about sex and drugs.</p><p>TikTok in December said it would adjust its algorithm to avoid showing users too much of the same content, in an effort to protect users' mental well-being.</p><p>At Panasonic Avionics, Ms. Razzano helped rebuild the company's ethics and compliance program after the unit reached a settlement with the U.S. authorities over violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, an antibribery law.</p><p>The company paid $280 million in 2018 as part of a settlement with the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations it retained consultants to pay bribes in the Middle East and Asia.</p><p>Under the settlement, Panasonic Avionics was required to hire an independent monitor to oversee a compliance overhaul and to ensure the unit's antibribery policies met the expectations of prosecutors. The company said the monitoring ended in March.</p><p>Write to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com</p><p>TikTok Hires Panasonic Executive to Expand Compliance Function</p>",
