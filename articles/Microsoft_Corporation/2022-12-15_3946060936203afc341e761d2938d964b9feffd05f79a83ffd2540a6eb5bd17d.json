  "title": "Big tech; After a dreadful year for tech firms, who will thrive in 2023?",
  "text": "<p>This year tech firms have had to cut back. Crunchbase, a data provider, estimates that more than 50,000 American tech workers have been laid off in 2022. Tech's big shake-up, however, may help the industry's giants grow even bigger in 2023. Big firms tend to be more resilient in a downturn, partly because they hold plenty of cash. That helps them hire and retain the best talent. The growth of the cloud-computing arms of the tech giants, including Amazon, Google and Microsoft, are likely to hold up well as software, services and data continue to move online.</p>",
