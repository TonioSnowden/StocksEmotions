  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  Careers & Leadership -- At Work:  The CIA Fine-Tunes Its Hiring Pitch  ---  The agency has revamped its recruiting to attract younger workers who might be skeptical of its mission  ----  By Krithika Varagur",
  "text": "<p>   Recruitment was a clubby affair in the earliest years of the Central Intelligence Agency. The CIA, founded in 1947, scoured Ivy League campuses and elite East Coast social circles to find promising young men (and a handful of women) to fill out its ranks at home and abroad. </p><p>   Today, the agency is turning to more public tools in a hiring push to expand and diversify its ranks. It runs video advertisements, has an Instagram account, and posts job openings on LinkedIn. It even launched a splashy new website in January whose content includes an advice column and dog-training tips, plus a bold new black-and-white logo. </p><p>   The CIA hopes these efforts will convince the millions of millennials and Gen-Zers scrolling through their phones and streaming TV to consider a career in intelligence. </p><p>   \"We had to go where the talent is,\" says Sheronda Dorsey, the CIA's deputy associate director for talent, who is now on LinkedIn herself. </p><p>   The agency has always relied on a steady influx of young people, especially recent college graduates, but has periodically faced challenges hiring them. Students frequently protested on-campus CIA recruiters in the 1960s, for instance. </p><p>   Today's CIA has its own obstacles. Polling shows that some millennials are more critical of past CIA actions and skeptical of the intelligence community's role than older generations are. The agency faces hiring competition from the private sector. And today's diffuse foreign policy arena presents no single mission to inspire recruits, like the focus on fighting al Qaeda after the 9/11 attacks. </p><p>   The Catch-22 of the CIA's hiring push is that while some of its controversial past actions are now public, its recruiters can't tell candidates specifically what they do accomplish. CIA employees past and present, including Ms. Dorsey, speak instead with hushed reverence about \"the mission,\" a unique set of exciting and meaningful security issues that they get to work on. </p><p>   Hiring today is less an issue of sheer numbers -- its number of new hires in 2020 was the third-largest in a decade, Ms. Dorsey says -- so much as attracting people of more diverse backgrounds. While there are no specific benchmarks, she says the agency hopes to increase racial, cultural, disability, sexual orientation and gender diversity so that its workforce is \"reflective of America.\" She adds that there are openings at all levels, including for midcareer professionals. </p><p>   An internal demographic survey of those employed in the intelligence community, which comprises 17 bodies including the CIA, found that 26.5% of them were minorities in the fiscal year 2019. </p><p>   Ms. Dorsey says STEM talent is a hiring priority. \"We know that we have deep competition for talent in the STEM field, and especially where they can offer higher compensation packages,\" she says. The agency uses the government's standardized General Schedule pay scale. </p><p>   A majority of Americans, 64%, gave the CIA a favorable rating in a Pew survey from 2018. But another 2018 survey by the University of Texas pointed to a generational divide: 78% of those born between 1928 and 1945 agreed that the intelligence community \"plays a vital role in protecting the country,\" versus only 47% of millennials. </p><p>   Richard Solomon, a 24-year-old graduate of Indiana University who majored in international relations, says he once dreamed of becoming a spy and first learned Arabic with that in mind. But he became disillusioned by the post-9/11 War on Terror. </p><p>   \"This sexy image I had as a child, of undercover CIA agents kind of saving the world, slowly eroded and was replaced by knowledge of torture chambers,\" he says, encapsulating some of his generation's skepticism. He is applying to Ph.D. programs to study the political economy of the Middle East, but hopes to focus on agriculture, rather than topics with straightforward intelligence applications. </p><p>   The CIA operated secret prisons known as black sites to detain and interrogate suspected terrorists after 9/11. The Senate Intelligence Committee said some of the interrogation techniques used there amounted to torture in a 2014 report. A 2014 Pew survey of 1,001 American adults found that 44% of those under 30 believed that the CIA's post-9/11 interrogation practices were justified, versus 60% of those over 50. </p><p>   The CIA declined to comment on the prisons. In 2014, then-director John Brennan declined to label any of the techniques as \"torture,\" but described some unauthorized interrogation methods as \"abhorrent.\" </p><p>   Today, the CIA's digital face-lift coincides with a new presidential administration. Mr. Brennan, whose directorship ended in 2017, says the Biden administration has sent out a \"very strong signal on diversity\" with its intelligence appointees, including the first-ever female director of national intelligence, Avril Haines. </p><p>   Douglas London, who retired in 2019 after 34 years in the CIA, questions whether public outreach is the best way to increase diversity. Instead, he says, just as with past generations of elite hires, \"You have to go and find them,\" with more personalized overtures to, for instance, promising students of specific regions and languages. </p><p>   Mr. London sat on CIA promotion and hiring panels throughout his career. He says getting hired was one thing, but continuing to work there as a minority could present challenges. He says that in the clandestine Directorate of Operations where he worked, there was resistance to matching nonwhite officers to certain assignments. </p><p>   \"It was not uncommon to hear an assertion like, 'You can't send a Black officer to Paris or Riyadh,' whereas there was no hesitation assigning a white officer to Baghdad,\" Mr. London says. But he doesn't believe these norms to be insurmountable obstacles and maintains that the CIA is a \"sensational place to work.\" </p><p>   The CIA declined to respond to Mr. London's comments. </p><p>   Whoever decides to take up the CIA's call for applications should prepare for a rigorous vetting process, which Ms. Dorsey says can take a year or longer. She assures anxious candidates: \"We are looking for honest people, not perfect people.\" </p><p>   Some prospective applicants are already prepared for such scrutiny. \"I've thought about vetting and security clearances my entire life,\" says 20-year-old Lauren Wadas, a junior at Brigham Young University-Idaho who is interested in working at the CIA. She keeps separate personal and professional Twitter accounts, and uses Facebook \"only for church and my grandparents.\" </p><p>   The CIA has advice for people like Ms. Wadas on its website: \"For your security, if you are interested in or have applied for a job at CIA, do not follow us on social media.\" </p><p></p>",
