  "text": "<p>Good evening from London,</p> <p>“An economy fit for a new age of optimism” was how UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak prefaced his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7c84fbe-0857-4de8-85c1-ed81f870a4f5\">Budget and spending review</a> today, helped by official forecasts that showed the pandemic scars left on Britain's economy would be less deep than expected.</p> <p>The judgment from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility that the long-term hit to the UK would be 2 per cent, rather than the 3 per cent it forecast in March, gave Sunak room to increase spending on public services and offer tax cuts in areas such as business rates and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ea375d1-d5df-4788-ae6c-ca144593ed7f\">alcohol duties</a>. UK growth for this year is now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83588552-6697-4005-b71f-b74289172625\">estimated to be 6.5 per cent</a>, meaning the economy could return to its pre-pandemic level by the end of the year. </p> <p>The chancellor also scaled back his proposed cut to the universal credit benefit, amid criticism that he was hitting the poorest just as they faced a serious cost of living crisis.</p> <p>Other highlights included a cut in the surcharge on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00edc75d-f45d-4f33-a042-79cdfd586026\">bank profits</a>, a continued freeze on fuel duty and cuts in air passenger duty on domestic flights — even as world leaders prepare to fly to the UK for a landmark climate change summit.</p> <p>In a pitch to more traditional Conservative supporters, Sunak said he was driven by a “moral” mission to halt the growth of the state, which now accounted for 50 per cent of the total economy because of the pandemic, and deliver tax cuts.</p> <p>But Rachel Reeves, shadow chancellor of the opposition Labour party, accused Sunak of “living in a parallel universe” with a government that was “lurching from crisis to crisis”, adding that the UK was only growing at the fastest rate in the G7 because it had fallen the furthest.</p> <p><strong>Key links</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3531f48-6640-4c9b-bdef-459291c3c580\">Full text of Sunak's speech</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af5cfe1f-e32d-4009-bfa8-b9344d600dc4\">What it means for your money</a>&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/autumn-budget-and-spending-review-2021-documents\">Official UK Budget documents</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/uk-budget\">Full FT coverage of the Budget</a></p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>McDonald's sales grew <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5b386c7-a6ff-4bc8-982a-549b850beeb9#post-0dc30832-35c0-4b86-b96e-af4871980243\">faster than anticipated</a> in the third quarter, driven by higher menu prices and larger orders as consumers returned to restaurants</p></li>  <li><p>Novavax has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5b386c7-a6ff-4bc8-982a-549b850beeb9#post-2cca3d3a-cb60-46d5-8b0b-4a62fbce4cd2\">filed for approval</a> of its Covid-19 vaccine in the UK, saying other global regulatory submissions would follow “shortly”</p></li>  <li><p>The UK's “acute” supply chain crisis — caused in large part by a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cd02b14-9ce1-4835-8f3d-666a9174c020\">shortage of lorry drivers</a> — will continue until the end of next year, a transport minister has warned</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5b386c7-a6ff-4bc8-982a-549b850beeb9\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>A rise in yields on short-dated <strong>US government bonds</strong> is the latest sign that investors are betting on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f6118e6-1937-4327-a3ff-9ee24eeb507c\">higher global interest rates</a>. The latest wave of selling was spurred by a rise in Australian inflation to 2.1 per cent.</p> <p>Russia's <strong>Gazprom</strong> has emptied its gas storage facilities in western Europe, according to new analysis, adding to fears that Moscow has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/576a96f7-e41d-4068-a61b-f74f2b2d3b81\">exacerbated the supply shortage</a> that has helped drive up prices. </p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p><strong>UK construction projects</strong> have been hit by the double whammy of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e37e2944-da21-4a2c-af16-9b5c0b70d4eb\">shortage of skilled workers</a> — because of Brexit and the pandemic — and soaring material costs due to the wider supply chain squeeze. Britain has been particularly poor at training the next generation of builders: “What we should have been doing for the last five years is preparing for this day. There are 60-70,000 young people who could come into construction every year but they don't,” said Jenny Herdman of the Homebuilders Federation.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>US Democrats laid out plans for a <strong>minimum tax on profits</strong> for 200 of America's biggest companies, as part of their party's attempts to secure a deal on President Joe Biden's “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38770267-8fed-49a9-a85a-1b9cc2e45d60\">Build Back Better</a>” agenda. The tax is meant to offset the costs of improving education, public healthcare and clean energy. Senior party members also detailed plans for a new tax on America's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38770267-8fed-49a9-a85a-1b9cc2e45d60\">700 billionaires</a>. </p> <p>A new report from the <strong>International Labour Organization</strong>, the UN agency, showed the impact of the pandemic on employment was <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_824098/lang--en/index.htm\">worse than expected</a>, with global hours worked this year 4.3 per cent below pre-pandemic levels — the equivalent of 125m full-time jobs.</p> <p><strong>Latin America</strong> has suffered almost a third of global Covid-19 deaths and its deepest recession ever, but the impact on the population has been uneven, highlighting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/786bfe7a-edd2-4d2a-b925-73a27c1e0ec1\">severe structural problems of inequality</a>, job insecurity and inadequate public services, despite the number of billionaires in the region surging.</p> <p>Tough pandemic restrictions meant growth in <strong>South Korea</strong>, Asia's fourth-largest economy, slowed in the third quarter, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ae79c67-8179-4158-a549-ee99b15530e0\">rising just 0.3 per cent</a> on the previous three months. However, an increase in vaccinations and the transition to “living with Covid” is expected to improve output in the final quarter.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p>Carmaker <strong>General Motors</strong> reported a drop in third-quarter revenues to $27bn, as it highlighted the effect on sales and profits of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13359b28-7207-4892-8547-8922617c62c2\">global semiconductor crisis</a>, which it said would still be making an impact throughout the first half of 2022. <strong>Electrolux</strong>, the world's second largest consumer appliances manufacturer, also highlighted the chip shortage and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/efc22e47-83d4-4a2e-af8e-7b075266be34\">wider supply chain problems</a> that meant underlying sales in the third quarter were flat at SKr31bn ($3.6bn).</p> <p><strong>Alphabet</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> have reported soaring <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/273aeecb-57a8-40f8-a2ba-8a21a635b289\">third-quarter earnings</a> thanks in part to the demand for cloud computing as the world shifted to remote working, as well as a revival in travel and retail for Alphabet's Google. Together, the duo announced revenues of $110.4bn, a combined growth of 33 per cent on last year's third quarter, which helped lift US stock indices to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aca67467-fd85-4aad-893f-96fb8ba59c97\">record levels</a>.</p> <p>Financial services is the other standout performer this results season. <strong>Santander</strong>'s profits <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a9891df-7caf-4c1d-a2da-e1bf50ac4d89\">rose by a quarter to €2.2bn</a>, with the US and the UK playing an outsized role, reflecting the uneven global recovery from the pandemic. <strong>Deutsche Bank </strong>reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80bf0f08-8224-42b9-8e2f-b3ae29fa86b2\">better than expected</a> profits of €194m, as the M&amp;A boom offset a drop in trading revenues. </p> <p>Stock shortages at <strong>UK retailers</strong> have hit a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b891e200-da57-4dcb-bda4-e0bcc6de228e#post-b6fb4952-a925-488e-bf1b-5d26942274dc\">30-year high</a>, according to a survey from the CBI, as businesses suffer from supply chain problems and a lack of staff. <strong>Booksellers</strong> have been stocking up early to avoid Christmas bottlenecks, helping drive a 29 per cent increase in first-half revenues to £101m at publishing group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad66cc61-6a19-421d-93b9-f2d18ef02c50\">Bloomsbury</a>.</p> <p><strong>Heathrow</strong>, the UK's busiest airport, said it had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/420c1fb1-4b45-4e5d-a0cd-095cadc8b645\">lost £500m</a> over the summer and that it would take five years for passenger numbers to recover fully from the pandemic. But even if the air travel industry recovers, it faces a long haul to reach its <strong>sustainable fuel</strong> goals of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c41864fc-2b78-4220-91d8-5a4f43fb12b0\">net zero flying by 2050</a>.</p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p><strong>Working It</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b23b39fa-1ff9-4489-9d15-5f857fccee28\">new podcast</a> from the FT's Work and Careers team, launched today with a discussion on wellness apps.

But they are not a panacea: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c303c3e7-5c4b-48e2-9ace-62e64fa757b6\">workers need decent conditions too.</a></p> <p><em>Get the latest worldwide picture with our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker/\"><em>vaccine tracker</em></a></p> <h1>And finally.</h1> <p>Pandemic restrictions permitting, it could soon be time to hit the road again.
