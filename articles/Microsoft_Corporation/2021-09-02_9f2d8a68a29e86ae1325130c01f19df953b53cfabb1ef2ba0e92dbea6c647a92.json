  "title": "Cyber Daily: Industry Groups Urge Lawmakers to Streamline Breach Reporting Rules",
  "text": "<p>As WSJ Pro's James Rundle reports today, industry groups vying to shape forthcoming legislation warned that overly broad definitions of attacks could lead to masses of useless information. Narrow definitions, though, could produce too little material to spot trends. Don't even get the parties started on reporting deadlinesâ€”24 hours? 72? How ever a law might shake out, the private sector wants to be insulated from lawsuits and any cyber details they report to be kept secret.</p><p>Bills in both the House and the Senate aren't far enough along for a vote. Corporate lobbyists and trade associations, meanwhile, are pressing their interests.</p><p>Read on for more news.</p><p>Firewalls were never designed to stop DDoS attacks.</p><p>The frequency and complexity of DDoS attacks are on the rise. And enterprises are more vulnerable than ever. Are you doing enough to protect yourself and your firewall?</p><p>Take Control</p><p>Incident Reporting</p><p>Looming rules: The growing body and scope of breach notification rules from regulators, state authorities and soon the federal government risks harming their effectiveness, private-sector groups say.</p><p>Lawmakers are considering mandatory requirements for companies in sectors such as finance, energy and power to report cyberattacks against their systems. Legislators have introduced bills in both the House and Senate since a series of cyberattacks on key businesses, including Microsoft, SolarWinds and Colonial Pipeline.</p><p>Separately, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is preparing a proposal on cybersecurity risk governance, which could include a notification component, Chairman Gary Gensler said Wednesday.</p><p>Read the full story.</p><p>More on the topic: Regulators Tighten Scrutiny of Data Breach Disclosures by Companies</p><p>More Cyber News</p><p>Spyware banned: The Federal Trade Commission banned the company Spyfone and Chief Executive Scott Zuckerman from the surveillance field, citing allegations the company collected and shared data on the movements of devices on which the software was loaded, among other privacy failings. The harvested data was then left vulnerable to hackers on a cloud storage system, the FTC said. (Bleeping Computer)</p><p>Insider threat: A former employee of a credit union based in New York pleaded guilty to destroying 20,433 documents including mortgage loan applications, after she was fired in May. She also deleted 3,478 directories and a folder containing information related to the credit union's ransomware protection tools, prosecutors said. (Bleeping Computer)</p><p>The credit union restored some data from backup files. It spent more than $10,000 dealing with the incident.</p><p>Privacy</p><p>U.K. children's privacy law set to go into effect. The Age Appropriate Design Code, created in the U.K.'s privacy office, requires social, gaming, video and music platforms to set strict privacy protections by default for minors in Britain. The code also calls for platforms that target children to turn off geo-location services and not to encourage child users to provide increasing amounts of data, among other provisions. (BBC)</p><p>The code was created in September 2020 and companies had one year to comply.</p><p>Companies must explain how they verify a user's age.</p><p>Ireland is formulating similar regulations.</p><p>Don't be predictable: It's no secret that many people are pitiful when selecting passwords. Research from cyber vendor SpecOps Software shows that lots and lots of us use our favorite D-1 college football team as a password. The company analyzed more than 800 million compromised passwords leaked online and found the very favorite is Georgia Tech.</p>",
