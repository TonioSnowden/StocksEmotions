  "title": "Blue Chips Slide Below 30000 --- Nasdaq sheds 4.1% as technology stocks lead losses a day after the Fed's big rate move",
  "text": "<p>Stocks rallied Wednesday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled the central bank would keep boosting rates but suggested the scale of Wednesday's increase would likely not become common.</p><p>On Thursday, that optimism fizzled, and stocks declined across the market as investors reassessed the risks ahead.</p><p>\"The outlook for growth and profits and inflation, at least over the next few months, is not all that favorable, unfortunately,\" said Michael Sheldon, chief investment officer at investment advisory firm RDM Financial Group.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 fell 123.22 points, or 3.3%, to 3666.77. The Dow industrials dropped 741.46 points, or 2.4%, to 29927.07. Both indexes ended at their lowest closing levels since December 2020.</p><p>The technology-focused Nasdaq Composite slumped 453.06 points, or 4.1%, to 10646.10, its lowest close since September 2020.</p><p>In a positive sign, S&amp;P 500, Dow and Nasdaq futures moved higher early Friday. But Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 2.2%.</p><p>The decline in the blue-chip average on Thursday could weigh on the mood of investors who had grown accustomed in recent years to stocks appearing to march ever higher.</p><p>\"It seems like anyone who was contemplating buying the dips, especially if we close below 30000, could easily say 'You know what, I'm just going to wait this one out,'\" said Carol Schleif, deputy chief investment officer at BMO Family Office.</p><p>The Fed's 0.75-percentage-point rate increase was its largest since 1994 but lined up with investors' expectations as the central bank races to tame high inflation. Recent data showed consumer inflation in May reached its highest level in more than four decades.</p><p>Mr. Powell said that while the central bank isn't trying to cause a recession, it was becoming more difficult to achieve a soft landing, in which the economy slows enough to damp inflation without entering a recession. Some analysts said investors are coming to terms with increasing risks to economic growth.</p><p>\"I think this is the realization that we really could be heading for a recession. I am not sure that had really filtered through to the mind of the market until now,\" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street Global Advisors.</p><p>Stocks fell across the board, with each of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors lower on the day. The energy group, the only sector in positive territory for 2022, logged a decline of 5.6%.</p><p>Big tech stocks retreated, with Microsoft shares falling 2.7%, Amazon shares declining 3.7%, and Nvidia shares dropping 5.6%.</p><p>While Mr. Powell suggested Wednesday that the \"unusually large\" rate rise wouldn't become common, he left the door open to another 0.75-percentage-point increase as soon as next month.</p><p>Interest-rate increases of that size could unsettle investors if they feel the Fed is racing too quickly to get ahead of inflation, said Aoifinn Devitt, chief investment officer at Moneta. \"That may lead to even more anxiety in the market,\" she said.</p><p>Switzerland's central bank surprised investors by increasing interest rates for the first time in 15 years. The Swiss National Bank raised its policy rate by 0.5 percentage point to minus 0.25%, leaving only the Bank of Japan among the major developed economy central banks not to have raised rates to tame inflation. Economists had expected the SNB to leave rates unchanged.</p><p>The Bank of England on Thursday raised its key interest rate as expected to 1.25% from 1%, marking its fifth move in as many meetings, and said larger moves might be required to tame inflation.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 3.303% from 3.389% on Wednesday. Treasury yields, which move in the opposite direction from prices, help set rates on a variety of consumer products including mortgages and auto loans.</p><p>Bitcoin declined for a 10th consecutive day, dropping 4.6% from its 5 p.m. ET level Wednesday to trade at $20,682.61. Cryptocurrencies have been hit by broad economic concerns that are hurting risky trades and worries about selected projects and companies in the crypto ecosystem. Investors in cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network are unlikely to provide the company with more financing that might bail out the company, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, gained 1.1% to $119.81 a barrel. Gold prices rose 1.7%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
