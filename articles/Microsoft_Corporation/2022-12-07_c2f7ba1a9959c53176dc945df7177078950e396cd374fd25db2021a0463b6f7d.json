  "text": "<p>Microsoft has signed a 10-year deal to bring <em>Call of Duty</em>, one of the world's most popular gaming franchises, to Nintendo's platforms for the first time in almost a decade, following its planned $75bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard. </p> <p>The announcement came as the US technology giant tries to address antitrust concerns to pull off the games industry's biggest deal. The takeover faces <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a55cc28e-3092-4725-a1a0-97c1bf6eed0f\">in-depth probes</a> in the UK and EU, while in the US, the Federal Trade Commission is reportedly nearing a decision on the tie-up. </p> <p>Rival Sony has led industry opposition to the takeover, arguing that any limitation on <em>Call of Duty's</em> availability on PlayStation would harm the console's sales. </p> <p>In an attempt to win over regulators, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/4f447b5d-53f5-41bd-ab42-3c0cfc161699\">Microsoft</a> has repeatedly argued <em>Call of Duty</em>, the blockbuster game that has brought in $30bn in lifetime sales for Activision, will continue to be available on other companies' game consoles after the deal, rather than being turned into an exclusive title on Microsoft's Xbox.</p> <p>“Microsoft is committed to helping bring more games to more people however they choose to play,” Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in a post on Twitter on Wednesday. </p> <p>Spencer also said Microsoft was committed to offering the popular series on Valve's Steam game distribution platform at the same time as it is released on Xbox.</p> <p>“Any day Sony wants to sit down and talk, we'll be happy to hammer out a 10-year deal for PlayStation as well,” he said. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/8d63a01d-076b-4316-9ce3-73b9879fecdc\">Sony</a> has told regulators that <em>Call of Duty</em> is so popular that it can influence which console consumers choose to buy, potentially disadvantaging its PlayStation 5 if Microsoft opted to bundle the title with its Xbox. </p> <p>In September, Jim Ryan, chief executive of Sony's gaming business, dismissed as “inadequate on many levels” a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/780c0432-554e-48fe-96df-6ffa4db9b5de\">previous offer from Microsoft</a> to keep <em>Call of Duty</em> on PlayStation for three years after the companies' current agreement ends. </p> <p>Analysts said Microsoft had taken a big step towards winning over regulators but that it may still need to go further, for instance by offering new assurances related to <em>Call of Duty's</em> inclusion in its Game Pass subscription service. </p> <p>“The major concession here is the length of time of these deals rather than <em>Call of Duty</em> being multi-platform,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, research director at Ampere Analysis. </p> <p>Striking a deal with Nintendo would have been relatively “easy”, said Harding-Rolls, as the game has been absent from the Japanese company's platforms for several years, therefore offering “upside for both companies” from its return. </p> <p>“A Sony deal is more complex,” he added. “My view is that there will need to be further concessions before a deal can be done with both Sony and these other bodies.” </p><p>Source: Kana Inagaki in Tokyo and Tim Bradshaw in London 2022 'Microsoft signs 10-year ‘Call of Duty' deal with Nintendo' FT.com 7 December.
