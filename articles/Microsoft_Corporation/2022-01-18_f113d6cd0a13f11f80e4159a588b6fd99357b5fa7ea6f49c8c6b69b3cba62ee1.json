  "text": "<p>The two US competition agencies are to overhaul merger guidelines, which could make it far harder to conclude large mergers and acquisitions as Joe Biden's administration seeks to crack down on anti-competitive practices. </p> <p>The Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice said in a joint statement on Tuesday that they were seeking input from the public on the rule revamp, which was aimed at strengthening antitrust enforcement amid a surge in tie-ups. Merger filings <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6dfdd78a-e229-4524-a400-144396524eb6\">more than doubled</a> between 2020 and 2021, they added. </p> <p>“We need to understand why so many industries have too few competitors, and to think carefully about how to ensure our merger enforcement tools are fit for purpose in the modern economy,” said Jonathan Kanter, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb3396a0-93f6-43b0-ae6b-1ddaab452787\">newly appointed head</a> of the justice department's antitrust division.</p> <p>With concentrated market structures, “everyone loses except . . . extractive powerful firms”, he added.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57cd6686-d1ee-4321-ae35-a8e1fc7f0813\">Lina Khan</a>, FTC chair, warned that a lack of competition has left “segments of our economy more brittle as consolidated supply and reduced investment in capacity can render us less resilient in the face of shocks”.</p> <p>President Biden last year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c207e1c4-8978-4482-8b4d-c353acce33d1\">announced a shake-up</a> of competition policy as he accused large companies of using their market power to exploit workers and consumers.</p> <p>As part of an executive order, he asked the FTC and justice department to rewrite the country's merger guidelines, which give companies a sense of when agencies will seek to block a transaction.</p> <p>Tuesday's announcement marked the first step towards drafting those guidelines, which were last updated in 2010. The agencies said they were particularly interested in competition matters that the current rules overlooked, such as the impact on labour markets or non-price issues including innovation and quality. </p> <p>They also asked the public to submit specific examples of anti-competitive tie-ups.</p> <p>Regulators have already moved to block megamergers in recent months. US regulators last month <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba37d061-cd26-47c0-9ff9-1fe8257ee8e2\">sued to prevent</a> Nvidia's acquisition of the UK chip design company Arm from SoftBank, a deal valued at $82bn. Last year, the administration sued to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d03e1302-4091-4b11-a590-1c65358f0ab4\">block a $30bn tie-up</a> between Aon and Willis Towers Watson, which would have created the world's biggest insurance broker. The deal subsequently collapsed.</p> <p>Even with the enhanced regulatory scrutiny, however, many companies appeared willing to pursue large deals. Just hours before the FTC and justice department announcement, Microsoft announced it had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3726a3a-c4a0-4761-a82c-cda98abc3cb7\">agreed to buy Activision Blizzard</a>, the video game maker, for about $75bn, including net cash, in what is set to be the company's biggest-ever purchase.</p> <p>The FTC and justice department are seeking information on more than a dozen topics, including whether the scope of mergers they review should be changed and if distinctions between certain types of transactions should be revisited to match markets. </p> <p>They are also enquiring whether rules should be tweaked to strengthen enforcement against deals that remove potential and nascent competitors. </p> <p>The agencies have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2e34de1-c21b-4963-91e3-12dff5c69ba4\">focused on the digital economy</a>, asking the public whether there should be different guidelines for deals in this sector, where products and services change rapidly.</p> <p>The “digital revolution” has affected sectors across the economy “many of which have been rebuilt from the inside out”, Kanter said.</p> <p>Sarah Miller, executive director of the progressive campaign group American Economic Liberties Project, said the call for comments was a “victory for honest businesses, working people, and consumers” that “should be applauded by anyone concerned about the power of Big Tech or the plight of working families”.</p> <p>The public may submit comments until March 21. The agencies hope to unveil the new rules by the end of the year.</p><p>Source: Stefania Palma and Kiran Stacey in Washington 2022 'US to overhaul merger rules in crackdown on ‘unlawful' deals' FT.com 18 January.
