  "text": "<p>The White House has accused Opec+ of aligning with Russia after Saudi Arabia <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/64d35a40-5144-44f6-afca-c8b88c9d0ad5\">led the group in agreeing deep oil production cuts</a>, threatening further inflationary pressures on a global economy already burdened by an energy crisis.</p> <p>The Opec+ group said it would reduce production targets by 2mn barrels a day, equivalent to 2 per cent of global supply, following its first in-person meeting in two years in Vienna.</p> <p>The aggressive decision to cut production, which will result in about 1mn bpd fewer on the world market, came despite extensive lobbying by the US government before the meeting and marked a significant breach with the Biden administration. The White House is seeking to drive down oil and petrol prices ahead of crucial midterm elections in November and to starve Russia of energy revenues.</p> <p>The Biden administration called the cuts “shortsighted”. White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Air Force One it was “clear” Opec+ was “aligning with Russia”.</p> <p>After rising in the run-up to the meeting, oil prices have stabilised today. Brent crude futures edged up 4 cents to $93.41 per barrel, up from $84 a barrel last week. US West Texas Intermediate futures gained 2 cents to $87.78 per barrel.</p> <p>Following the Opec+ decision, the US government said it would continue to release oil from its strategic stockpiles “as appropriate” and that it was exploring “additional responsible actions” to lift domestic oil supply.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Explainer:</strong> The implications of Opec+'s decision reaches <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ff534c5-3b99-40d0-84f2-19b88743190e\">well beyond the oil price</a> to the future of the relationship between the US and Saudi Arabia, as our energy team explains. </p></li> </ul> <p><em>What do you think the US should do about rising energy prices?
