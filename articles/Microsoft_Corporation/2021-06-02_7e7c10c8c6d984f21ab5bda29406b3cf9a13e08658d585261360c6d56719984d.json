  "text": "<p>(WSJ June 4, 2021)</p><p>(END)</p><p>The latest strangeness, courtesy of the pandemic: New York City's unemployment rate is still at 11.4% -- twice the national average. At the same time, there are help wanted signs all over town, and business owners say they're having trouble hiring enough staff.</p><p>\"They need people so they can roll up their gates every day and serve coffee,\" says Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce President Randy Peers. In a recent chamber survey, 64% of the borough's businesses -- most notably small service establishments such as restaurants, barbershops and child-care providers -- said they couldn't hire enough help.</p><p>Many peg this unusual situation entirely on the extended pandemic unemployment benefits. In New York state, recipients can collect up to $804 a week -- a third more than the current $15 minimum wage. No wonder people stay home.</p><p>The reality, of course, is more complicated. I spent a week speaking with people who are still unemployed and they had a lot to say. Their reasons range from the practical to the ideological -- and may represent a shift in thinking that will endure long after the pandemic's end. Much like the white-collar workers who say they hope to never resume commuting, some service workers say they hope to never again work for a boss.</p><p>\"There is dignity in hard work,\" says Shelly Coleman, a Brooklyn massage therapist collecting unemployment. \"But there is also dignity in not being miserable.\"</p><p>A large share of the city's unemployed work in industries that are just starting to recover including the performing arts, nightlife and tourism. Many are collecting unemployment until they are called back to work or the freelance gigs return.</p><p>There also are some who say they have earnestly sought work without success. Lawrence Boucher, a 43-year-old Manhattan resident, has served as a workplace-experience manager for tech companies including LinkedIn and PayPal, handling everything from facilities management to employee perks. That ended in spring 2020 when his most recent employer went all-remote and laid off a third of the staff.</p><p>Most of his engineering colleagues landed new jobs within weeks, he says. But despite applying for more than 150 positions, he is still on unemployment.</p><p>The problem? While he's getting plenty of interviews and made it to the final round on several occasions, each time the hiring company rethought its office reopening plans and decided against creating the role for which he was interviewing.</p><p>A serious job hunt, he adds, is a full-time occupation, and it doesn't make sense to take a temporary job flipping burgers.</p><p>Other unsuccessful job seekers said city employers seem slow to adjust to the worker shortage. Many still require years of experience for positions ranging from dog walker to waiter, declining to provide on-the-job training.</p><p>\"I'm looking for retail jobs and there's all these objections,\" says Rebecca Rranza, a 23-year-old East Village resident pursuing her masters at Parsons School of Design.</p><p>The available jobs offer minimum wage and part-time hours, she adds, which won't pay the rent.</p><p>Indeed, the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce survey reported that despite having trouble hiring, less than a third of businesses have altered their recruitment strategies to offer more flexible and remote work hours or improved benefits and pay.</p><p>But the most interesting conversations I had were with those who suggested there's a larger movement afoot: People who worked in difficult, dead-end jobs for years say the pandemic made them rethink their relationship to work.</p><p>\"People have started valuing their lives more,\" says Michael Smith, a 40-year-old Bronx resident who has worked minimum-wage jobs since he was 16 including ambulette driver and auto detailer.</p><p>Having been through the pandemic while watching loved ones die of Covid-19, he can't stomach the idea of taking another job where he needs permission to use the bathroom, never gets a paid vacation and can't take a personal day for a family emergency.</p><p>\"What is this 'work like a slave' stuff? People don't want to do that anymore,\" he says. \"Times are changing. You have to treat people differently. People have higher expectations for themselves and from employers.\"</p><p>The higher wages and bonuses some fast-food chains are suddenly offering only sharpened his resentment.</p><p>\"Why wait until now to raise wages?\" Mr. Smith says. \"You could have paid more before this happened.\"</p><p>He's looking into working as a freelance musician or starting a small van-based business, washing cars or doing rubbish removal.</p><p>\"If you can avoid working for a company and work for yourself, do it,\" he says.</p><p>The most extreme are those who want to see the extended benefits made permanent.</p><p>Dan Romero has more than 10 years experience in the restaurant business, most recently as a line cook. His talents are in high demand. But the 36-year-old is content to work a few days a week in a Brooklyn cheese-finishing cave. His $412 unemployment checks allow him to pursue his own interests the rest of the week, including renovating the modest upstate home he recently bought with his fiancee.</p><p>\"I don't want to give someone else more than three days of my time,\" says Mr. Romero, who believes his views are increasingly shared by fellow millennials. \"I'm much happier now.\"</p><p>Mr. Romero believes society is wealthy enough to support this lifestyle for himself and anyone else who chooses to work less: \"People look at me and say, 'You need to go to work.' I say, 'Maybe you need to not go to work!' \"</p><p>And when the unemployment runs out? Mr. Romero is looking into starting his own small business -- perhaps a food truck. \"I'm not going back to the kitchen,\" he says. \"That's one more job someone else can get.\"</p><p>---</p><p>anne.kadet@wsj.com</p>",
