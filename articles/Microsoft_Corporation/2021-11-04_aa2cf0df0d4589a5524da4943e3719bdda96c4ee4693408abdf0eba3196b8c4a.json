  "text": "<p>The US Federal Reserve said it would begin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d10c157f-5530-48a0-9c5f-afed19057d8a\">scaling back</a> its massive $120bn monthly bond-buying programme this month, a critical milestone for a US economy that is recovering from the pandemic and contending with surging inflation. </p> <p>The decision is the culmination of months of painstaking debate among Fed officials about the level of support needed for the world's largest economy as price pressures begin to extend beyond the sectors most sensitive to the post-pandemic reopening. </p> <p>Yet the announcement barely registered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/089073e5-68bd-43e7-85a8-03167df8237c\">in financial markets</a>. Wall Street stocks climbed to record highs while short-dated US government yields inched up only marginally.</p> <p>The muted market reaction reflected not just the Fed's efforts to prepare investors for the “taper” of its massive stimulus, but also chair Jay Powell's insistence that it was still far too early to think about raising US interest rates despite widespread inflation.</p> <p>“It's appropriate to be patient,” Powell said during a press conference following the&#xa0;Fed's two-day meeting at which the central bank said it would scale back its bond-buying programme by $15bn each month — a timeline that puts it on track to withdraw the stimulus entirely by the middle of next year.</p> <p>Powell said the US economy had not yet met the much more stringent test for executing the next step of monetary tightening of raising interest rates. The Fed has stipulated it would maintain interest rates at today's near-zero levels until it achieves maximum employment and inflation that averages 2 per cent “over time”.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper:</strong> Colby Smith and Kate Duguid have done a full analysis of the Fed's latest monetary policy announcement <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7e5b235-fb44-496c-af3e-297d1aa1a8ca\">here</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Comment:</strong> Robert Armstrong provides his main takeaways from the statement in the latest edition of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2557245-2423-458f-bb23-61d4690b5bd4\">Unhedged</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Do you think the Federal Reserve is being too cautious?

The New Jersey result, in a state where Joe Biden won by a 16-point margin in 2020, followed a stunning defeat for Democrat Terry McAuliffe in Virginia's gubernatorial&#xa0;election against Republican Glenn Youngkin. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The results in Virginia and New Jersey — mirrored in other contests across the country — suggested <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a44828e6-c522-449e-8f49-91a8c9fff3eb\">an “enthusiasm gap”</a> between fired-up Republican voters and less-exercised Democrats, write Lauren Fedor and James Politi in Washington.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Comment:</strong> Democrats must look beyond Joe Biden and Kamala Harris for 2024, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9854abf5-b689-4e09-b007-5fe047337e3b\">writes Janan Ganesh</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2.

China plans to quadruple nuclear weapons stockpile</strong> A new Pentagon assessment of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1225e37-30ef-4fa7-99a9-e5994ebe2aba\">China's nuclear weapons capabilities</a> said Beijing could have 700 deliverable warheads by 2027 and would boost its stockpile — currently estimated in the low 200s — to at least 1,000 by the end of the decade, marking a dramatic increase from last year's estimate by the US defence department.</p> <p><strong>5. US puts Israeli spyware company NSO on blacklist</strong> The company that created software traced to the phones of journalists and human rights activists around the world <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e381b556-c859-4a3b-8f7c-5fe80d3272d2\">has been added to a trade blacklist</a> by the commerce department.
