  "text": "<p>Analysts surveyed by FactSet had estimated net income of $1.26 a share on ex-TAC revenue of $58.2 billion and overall revenue of $71 billion. Alphabet shares slipped 6% in after-hours trading immediately following the release of the results, after closing with a 2% increase at $104.48.</p><p>The results, which missed in several key product categories, further rattled investors, already spooked by poor quarterly results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP. Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. META is scheduled to report its third-quarter results Wednesday.</p><p>\"Financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud, while affected by foreign exchange. We're working to realign resources to fuel our highest growth priorities,\" Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in a statement announcing the results.</p><p>Google's total advertising sales improved to $54.5 billion from $53.13 billion a year ago, but badly missed analysts' average expectations for $56.58 billion. Search was $39.5 billion, compared with $37.93 billion last year. YouTube ad sales slipped to $7.07 billion from $7.21 billion a year ago.</p><p>\"When Google stumbles, it's a bad omen for digital advertising at large,\" Insider Intelligence analyst Evelyn Mitchell said. \"Not only did Google miss analyst expectations for topline revenue, YouTube ad revenues shrank for the first time since Google started reporting YouTube earnings separately in Q4 2019, due in large part to persistent competition in streaming and short video.\"</p><p>Google's Cloud revenue did climb to $6.9 billion from $4.99 billion; Google Cloud is believed to be third in cloud sales behind rivals Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Microsoft Corp. MSFT.</p><p>As is its customary practice, Alphabet did not disclose fourth-quarter guidance.</p><p>Google's stock has skidded 28% so far this year. The broader S&amp;P 500 index SPX is down 19% in 2022.</p><p>Google ad sales take a hit and widely miss estimates, Alphabet stock drops 6%</p>",
