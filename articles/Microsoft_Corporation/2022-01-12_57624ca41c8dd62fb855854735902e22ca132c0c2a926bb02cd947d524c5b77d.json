  "text": "<p>Someone was fooled, clicked a bad link and set off a chain of events that have consumed Ms. Fiskvik's tech team for the past five weeks. Whiteboards stood in for hospitality applications. A makeshift operations support center grew in an employee's dining room. And someone at the main office in Norway or at one of the chain's 200 hotels communicated with the attackers despite warnings not to.</p><p>There but for the grace of good cybersecurity training go all of us.</p><p>Continued below.</p><p>7 requirements for detecting Log4j exploits using packets.</p><p>Along with scanning and patching, start detecting and blocking. See why packet-derived data is the ultimate protection against Log4j exploitation.</p><p>Read More</p><p>Once inside the hotel's network, the hackers took out most of the company's antivirus systems and copied data from local Windows files, Ms. Fiskvik said.</p><p>They then deployed ransomware known as Conti—the same strain that has crippled a number of corporate victims in recent months, plus Ireland's public healthcare system in 2020.</p><p>To stop the spread, Nordic Choice shut down corporate computers, check-in desks and machines such as music systems, and disconnected computers from the internet. Hotel staff recorded check-in details with pens and paper, and escorted guests to their rooms because digital keycards didn't work.</p><p>The company decided to fast-track an existing plan to switch from Microsoft's Windows system to Google's Chrome products. From an impromptu dining-room operations center (pictured), Simon Johansson (on phone), Adam Munkbo and Emilia Söderberg from Nordic Choice's operational support team helped hotel employees with the migration.</p><p>As technologists worked to recover computer systems, hackers posted personal information about employees on the dark web, including details about bank accounts and government-issued identification numbers.</p><p>Ms. Fiskvik (pictured) said the privacy invasion created some non-technical aftermath. \"It was definitely very hard on our employees to know that data about them was out on the web, public to anyone with a link,\" she said.</p><p>Read the full story.</p><p>More Cyber News</p><p>Cybersecurity is a threat to the global economy but experts and business leaders might not be taking it seriously enough, the World Economic Forum says. In its annual Global Risks Report released Tuesday, the WEF said a poll of 959 academic, business and government leaders world-wide named hacking as a short- and medium-term threat but didn't cite cybersecurity among the most severe risks over the next 10 years.</p><p>\"This suggests lower relevance to respondents—or a blind spot in perceptions given the potential damage of cyber-risks—compared to economic, societal and environmental concerns,\" the WEF said.</p><p>Practice, practice, practice: The European Union this week plans to start six weeks of simulated cyberattacks on supply chains in several member countries, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter and related documents. The exercise is intended to test resiliency and cooperation in the EU, included in the face of cyberattacks intense enough to be categorized by the United Nations as armed aggression.</p><p>Jennifer Boyce, general counsel and chief compliance officer at midmarket investor Riverside Co., sees cybersecurity as an emerging challenge for private equity. \"What really worries me is a cyber breach on one of our providers that we had no way to control or have anything to do with,\" she said. (WSJ Risk &amp; Compliance Journal)</p><p>4 Million</p><p>Number of downloads of flawed versions of the Log4j logging tool since vulnerabilities were disclosed Dec. 10, according to Sonatype Inc., a software provider that also runs a repository of Apache open-source tools. (The Register)</p><p>Enterprise software company SAP SE released nine security updates on Tuesday, including one for a Log4j issue rated at the highest severity.</p><p>CPH Group, a large manufacturer in Switzerland, shut down its paper and packaging units after a cyberattack on Friday. CPH's chemicals unit was unaffected, the company said.</p><p>How to tell if Russian hackers are looming: U.S. officials released an advisory on Tuesday outlining recent tactics they say are state-sponsored attacks linked to Russia. The lengthy document details techniques used against specific tech products, including Microsoft Exchange servers, Cisco routers, several from cybersecurity companies and particular operational and industrial control systems. Recommended response steps are also listed.</p><p>Careers &amp; CISO Moves</p><p>The CISO is gaining stature as more corporate boards realize that cybersecurity is a topic directors must understand and oversee. Just more than 60% of CISOs report to someone other than the chief information officer, according to a survey of 354 U.S. security chiefs from recruiter Heidrick &amp; Struggles International Inc. That reflects the rising sentiment among senior leaders that cybersecurity is a business—not a technology—risk.

That's up from $473,000 in 2020.</p><p>Privacy</p><p>Europol is storing data on individuals not formally associated with crime, and holding it for too long, said the European Data Protection Supervisor. The regulator ordered the police agency to delete the information. EDPS has in the past requested Europol set data-retention deadlines and reprimanded it for keeping \"large volumes\" of data, which poses a risk to privacy rights. (Associated Press)</p>",
