  "title": "Microsoft Earnings Growth Seen Slowing as Computer Sales Slip; Software giant's cloud business expected to grow as Windows sales fall",
  "text": "<p>That would mean last quarter had the slowest revenue growth in more than five years and the lowest income growth in more than two years. The company is scheduled to announce results after the market closes on Tuesday.</p><p>The software giant, which gets the lion's share of its sales from companies, is doing better than tech companies that depend more on consumer spending and advertising. However, demand for its Windows operating system software has dipped with sales of the personal computers that use it. Around the world, households, companies and governments that bought computers during the pandemic are scaling back.</p><p>Global shipments of desktop and laptop computers fell in the third quarter by 18% from a year earlier, according to a recent report by market-research firm Canalys. Notebook shipments were particularly hard hit, it said.</p><p>While revenue from the operating system isn't as important to Microsoft as it used to be, Mark Moerdler, a senior research analyst at Bernstein Research, called Windows in a recent report \"an important business and meaningful weakness\" that will be visible in the company's top and bottom lines.</p><p>Microsoft is also a top player in cloud-computing services that have boomed during the pandemic. In the middle of the health crisis, Microsoft reported several quarters in a row of 50% or more year-over-year sales growth for its Azure cloud-computing platform, the world's No. 2 behind Amazon.com Inc.'s cloud.</p><p>The pace of growth has moderated this year, however. Analysts surveyed by FactSet predicted revenue at Azure and Microsoft's other cloud services to slow to 37% last quarter from 50% in the same quarter last year.</p><p>As companies grapple with high inflation, rising interest rates and economic worries, Microsoft says they use its software and cloud services more for efficiency and flexibility.</p><p>\"Doing more with less doesn't mean working harder or longer,\" Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said at a company event earlier this month. \"It means applying technology to amplify what you can do and ultimately what an organization can achieve amidst today's constraints.\"</p><p>The strength of the dollar has also cut into Microsoft's growth. The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks U.S. currency performance against other currencies, is up close to 17% since the beginning of the year. Microsoft gets close to half of its sales overseas, and a strong dollar means the money it earns in foreign currency translates into fewer dollars.</p><p>International Business Machines Corp. has had to contend with many of the same trends and last week announced higher-than-expected sales figures for last quarter. It cited continued strong demand for its cloud-computing services and artificial intelligence products.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's your outlook for Microsoft? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Microsoft shares have fallen around 26% so far this year, slightly better than the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, which has declined close to 30%. Over the same period, Apple Inc. shares have fallen around 16% while Meta Platforms Inc. has tumbled close to 61%.</p><p>Earlier this month Microsoft said it was laying off employees to adjust to evolving business prospects. It didn't say how many people it was cutting. In July, the software maker said it had plans to make cuts affecting less than 1% of its total workforce of more than 200,000 people.</p><p>Videogames and Microsoft's Xbox videogame consoles are an increasingly important business for the company. The videogaming industry is going through a slowdown as pandemic-related restrictions ease and people spend less time at home.</p><p>Still, Microsoft made a huge bet on the sector in January with its $75 billion plan to acquire videogame company Activision Blizzard Inc. Regulators around the world are scrutinizing the plan, and the company said it expects the deal to close by the end of next June.</p><p>Write to Asa Fitch at asa.fitch@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft Earnings Growth Seen Slowing as Computer Sales Slip</p>",
