  "text": "<p>\n  Active Voice: Finding the Right Nonprofit </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Madeline Firkser </p><p>\n  Age: 24 </p><p>\n  Location: New York City </p><p>\n  Title: Special Projects Associate </p><p>\n  Company: JustLeadershipUSA </p><p>\n  Time in the job: Eighteen months </p><p>\n  Education: BA in Sociology, Bard College </p><p>\n  Key skills: Communication, project management, research </p><p>\n  Salary: $55,000-$70,000 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Madeline Firkser says the best part of her day at JustLeadershipUSA, a New York-based criminal-justice reform organization, is working with a broad group of colleagues. </p><p>\n  \"Some of us are still incarcerated,\" she says. \"Some of us have family members who are directly impacted, and some of us, like myself, haven't been touched by the criminal-justice system in tangible ways.\" </p><p>\n  Ms. Firkser was looking to channel her college activism into a career, but her first job after graduation wasn't a great fit. She says she leaned on her network when it was clear she needed to pivot. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's a typical day like for you? </p><p>\n  A: I serve as a project manager for the entire organization, so that can range from administrative tasks, to making sure we're maintaining deliverables and contracts with outside partners, to brand-building. I work in the policy and advocacy department, so I manage some of our most important campaigns. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What was your first job after college? </p><p>\n  A: I ended up getting a job at a really corporate, national nonprofit. I was like, OK, I got the dream and I got the salary, I'm doing well. But I really was unhappy there. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: How did you get your current job? Did you apply online? </p><p>\n  A: I still did the whole cover letter-and-resume thing. But at the end of the day, it was really not just about my skills, but about my relationships. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What would you tell a college student who's just starting the job hunt? </p><p>\n  A: What I always tell people is: \"Participate.\" Reach out to someone whose name you heard, or whose book you read, or who you saw on a panel -- always reach out to them if what they do inspires you. LinkedIn offers a free premium membership for a month. Do that, and then message people who you think you want to learn more about. You never know who might become your friend or mentor along the way. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's your best advice for someone who realizes their first job isn't a good fit? </p><p>\n  A: It's OK to not love your job. It's supernormal. Allow yourself some grace. From there, try and talk to your allies. Maybe that isn't your peers in the job you don't like, but it might be. Take the risk of being a little vulnerable. Even in this one job that I really didn't like, there were a few people who from time to time would ask how it was going. I was really hesitant, but once I did say, \"OK, I'm struggling here,\" I got some of the best advice ever. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Cartoon Networking: Drawn to Animation </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Cheyenne Chapel </p><p>\n  Age: 24 </p><p>\n  Location: Working remotely from Walnut Creek, Calif.; Pixar HQ in Emeryville, Calif. </p><p>\n  Title: Set Dressing Technical Director </p><p>\n  Company: Pixar Animation Studios </p><p>\n  Time in the job: One year </p><p>\n  Education: BS in Visualization, Texas A&amp;M </p><p>\n  Key skills: Modeling, set dressing, lighting, Python </p><p>\n  Salary: $77,700 a year median, according to government statistics </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Cheyenne Chapel has always loved disappearing into the immersive worlds of animated movies and games. </p><p>\n  She remembers first hearing Buzz Lightyear's famous catchphrase, \"To infinity and beyond,\" when she saw \"Toy Story 2\" and lights up when she describes playing \"Jak and Daxter\" on PlayStation 20 years ago. In college she saw \"Coco,\" Pixar's 2017 film about a boy who is accidentally transported to the Land of the Dead, and was stunned by the beauty and richness of the world it portrayed. </p><p>\n  Now, as a set modeler and dresser for Walt Disney Co.'s Pixar Animation Studios, she builds the digital buildings, vehicles and landscapes that conjure vivid worlds. Her debut credit was Pixar's 2020 release \"Soul.\" She followed that up with contributions to \"Luca,\" released on Disney+ last month, and is now at work on the background of \"Lightyear,\" scheduled for release next summer. </p><p>\n  \"Getting a chance to make a sci-fi adventure film with Buzz, it's always cool to me,\" said Ms. Chapel. \"And I think it's going to look insane. I just feel like I came in at a really cool time.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What drew you to this kind of work? </p><p>\n  A: Animation and anime have always been some of the biggest influences on my life. The films that I've connected to the most have, a lot of times, been Pixar films. Especially \"Toy Story 3.\" It's just crazy to see the amount of work and passion [that go into these movies]. </p><p>\n  In college I actually started out in architecture; I was trying to get into the animation degree but it's very competitive. I ended up getting into the program my sophomore year. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: How did you get your current job? </p><p>\n  A: In my junior year I actually was a Pixar Undergraduate Program intern. It was a 10-week program where we just got immersed within each department of the production track at Pixar. After that I knew I wanted to work at Pixar. </p><p>\n  I ended up returning after I graduated to do a sets modeling and dressing internship on \"Soul.\" During that year I transitioned from an intern to a resident, which is like an apprenticeship. Then I ended up going full-time after that. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's the best part of your job? </p><p>\n  A: Seeing how my friends, family, and the world receive the films that we make and knowing that I get to contribute to them. Whenever I would go to the movies and see films I'd just be captivated. Someone else experiencing something like that is very fulfilling for me. </p><p>\n  I get to work on films with some really great friends. Each film could take four-plus years, depending on the production, done by 200, 300 people. I get to nerd out with people about the same stuff and they understand what I'm talking about. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's the most challenging part of your job? </p><p>\n  A: As artists we all tend to be very hard on ourselves. For me, the most challenging thing is being comfortable with being uncomfortable, like when I'm showing my work. That's one of the most stressful things, because when you see your work, it's not even just you seeing it. It's millions of people seeing it. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: Outside of your internship, what do you think is the most critical thing you did that led to you having your current job? </p><p>\n  A: Networking and talking to people is something that I think everyone talks about, \"You should network!\" Even though I know it's the most challenging thing for a lot of people, it's the first thing that you can do to help get you into the positions that you want to get to. </p><p>\n  I went to Siggraph, [an annual computer graphics industry conference] and that was where I actually got to meet a lot of the Pixar team and was able to form relationships with people. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's your best advice for somebody who might want a job like the one you have at Pixar? </p><p>\n  A: Reach out to technical directors and recruiters. Use your time to start seeing the process of what Pixar does. Each studio is different and animation as a whole is such a unique and specific niche of art. You kind of have to understand the field that you're going into. Know at least a little bit about the industry so you can understand terminology. You don't want to just apply to an industry and not necessarily have any context for what you're getting yourself into. </p><p>\n  A lot of us animation people, we didn't grow up in a way, because we still kind of kept that wonder -- just seeing the world in a different light and being able to help bring that together. Keeping that same energy that you had when you're a kid and translating that to the application process, even though I know it can be difficult and rough, it will all work out just as long as you keep trying. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  The Milk Man: Nondairy Dreamer </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Josh Belinsky </p><p>\n  Age: 26 </p><p>\n  Location: Boston </p><p>\n  Title: Co-founder </p><p>\n  Company: Slate Milk </p><p>\n  Time in the job: 3 years </p><p>\n  Education: BS in business administration, Northeastern University </p><p>\n  Key skills: Sales, relationship building, Excel </p><p>\n  Salary: 'Below market-rate salary, majority equity ownership of business with co-founder' </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  A string of internships during college and a job at a tech startup had already positioned Josh Belinsky for a promising career in sales by the time he graduated from Northeastern University. </p><p>\n  But he credits a postgraduation trip to Greece, during which his phone was stolen, with encouraging him to start his own company. </p><p>\n  \"I didn't miss it at all, and I didn't think about work. That's when I knew, 'OK, I'm clearly not happy here if I'm not tuned into what's going on,'\" says Mr. Belinsky, who co-founded Slate Milk, which makes ultrafiltered, lactose-free chocolate milk, in 2018. Since launching, the company has raised $2.5 million, landed on shelves in 3,000 stores and appeared on \"Shark Tank.\" (The Sharks passed.) </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What drew you to this kind of work? Did you always want to be an entrepreneur? </p><p>\n  A: My great-grandfather came over from Russia in the early 1900s and started a butcher shop in downtown Boston and it was in my family until the 1980s. Everybody in my family has it in their blood to work from a young age. I was 8 years old and I started caddying for my dad and then some of his friends, and I did that for about 12 years. I was basically running my own business. I loved the hustle of it. </p><p>\n  When I was in college, I worked at a couple of corporate jobs and two different startups. I was able to learn how people are fundraising, how startups get off the ground, how they deal with investors, how they build a pricing model. I ended up partnering up with another local Boston entrepreneur and we started this business. I love chocolate milk and I became lactose intolerant in fifth grade. Chocolate milk is something that brings people happiness and a lot of people can't drink it anymore, and so we wanted to try to bring it back to adults. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  WSJ: What's the best part of your job? </p><p></p>",
