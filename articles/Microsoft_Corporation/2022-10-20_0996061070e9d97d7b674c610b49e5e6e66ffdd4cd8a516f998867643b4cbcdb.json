  "text": "<p>Many of Ms. Swift's biggest fans, known as Swifties, are eager and excited to keep up with each announcement, texting each other the news, setting alarms or taking naps after work to better accommodate their new schedule.</p><p>That devotion could reach new heights on Friday. After \"Midnights\" comes out at midnight, Ms. Swift will unveil a \"special very chaotic surprise\" at 3 a.m. ET, according to a calendar the musician shared this week. Five hours later, at 8 a.m., she will release the music video to her new song \"Anti-Hero.\"</p><p>\"Doesn't she realize we're millennials? I have to go to work and I'm 29 weeks pregnant,\" said Alyssa Lee, a 27-year-old IT consultant in the Dallas area.</p><p>\"Don't get me wrong,\" she added, \"I'm still going to stay awake to listen to it.\"</p><p>The majority of artists release their albums at midnight on Fridays. But Ms. Swift's agenda items add new late-night tasks for fans. With weeks of late nights under their belts, many of Ms. Swift's biggest fans are prepared for their sleepless night. Some plan to set alarms between the album release and 3 a.m. announcement. Others already took the day off of work Friday.</p><p>Ms. Swift is known for leaving clues for fans to examine about her next single, album or project. She released a series of videos—called \"Midnights Mayhem with Me\"—at midnight starting in September to reveal the title of each of the 13 tracks on her album. The series concluded on Oct. 7, when Ms. Swift unveiled the names of the last five tracks—in separate posts early into the morning.</p><p>The official Taylor Nation Twitter account shared a \"#MayhemTilTheMorning Survival Guide\" earlier this month, with tips like \"Make some Midnights snacks,\" \"Order an extra-large latTAY\" and \"Call your bestie (&amp; call out of work).\"</p><p>A representative for Ms. Swift didn't respond to requests for comment. The weekslong lead up to \"Midnights\" differs from her surprise announcements of her past two new studio albums—\"Folklore\" and \"Evermore\"—which gave fans only hours of lead time to prepare.</p><p>\"Knowing Taylor Swift was famous for her Easter eggs, I knew once it was called 'Midnights' that I was in trouble and it was going to be a long-haul marathon,\" said Sydney Wolff, a 26-year-old living in the Boston area who works for Microsoft.</p><p>This Friday, Ms. Wolff is taking what she calls a \"Tay-cation\" day—a day off work to properly enjoy the album. She has scheduled Tay-cation following the release of every one of Ms. Swift's albums since 2017's \"Reputation.\"</p><p>Ms. Wolff and her girlfriend plan to listen to the album, stay up for the 3 a.m. announcement and sleep between that and the 8 a.m. \"Anti-Hero\" video release. Ms. Wolff will then head to the nearest Target to purchase the retailer's exclusive edition of \"Midnights\" with bonus tracks.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>If you're a Swiftie, what do you think the \"special\" surprise announcement will be after the release of \"Midnights\"? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"So, it's a very busy day,\" Ms. Wolff said.</p><p>Courtney Santore, a 38-year-old kindergarten teacher in Wichita, Kansas, also has a personal day scheduled this Friday. While the day off was already planned for family-related travel, it's convenient that it also happens to land on the day following Ms. Swift's album release, she said.</p><p>Mrs. Santore, a Swiftie since 2006, has managed to keep up with the \"Midnights\" lead-up, her job, parent-teacher conferences and her family with the help of energy drinks and naps after work, she said. It also helps that she lives in a central time zone, so those midnight announcements come at 11 p.m. for her.</p><p>\"You do anything for Taylor Swift,\" she said.</p><p>The late-night announcements align with the sleep schedules of some fans like Laura Laughead, a 24-year-old news anchor and reporter in Birmingham, Ala. She was anchoring a newscast past 11 p.m. CT Sunday night when Ms. Swift and Spotify began to reveal some of the lyrics to the new songs on billboards.</p><p>\"I'm very pleased that Taylor Swift is an insomniac,\" Ms. Laughead said. \"If she was a morning person, I'd be in trouble.\"</p><p>Other fans have learned to accept that late nights just won't work with their schedules. Abby Earl, a 30-year-old project manager from Oklahoma, is a self-professed \"senior Swiftie\" and can't stay up late enough for the announcements and album release.</p><p>A fellow fan on the West Coast bought three of four signed CDs and a jade green vinyl for her when they became available on recent nights, she said.</p><p>At 16 weeks pregnant, Mrs. Earl plans to catch up on \"Midnights\" and the announcements early Friday morning.</p><p>\"I definitely feel left out because I don't set an alarm and I cannot change my sleep schedule,\" Mrs. Earl said. \"But I've accepted it.\"</p><p>For Ms. Lee, the IT consultant in Texas, keeping up with Ms. Swift has required some backup. She was fast asleep when Ms. Swift announced her new album while accepting an award at the MTV Video Music Awards in late August. When her friend Téa Thomas-Lowe, 24, heard the news, she quickly texted Ms. Lee. With no response, she alerted Ms. Lee's husband—who then woke his wife up.</p><p>\"That was the correct response,\" Ms. Lee said.</p><p>Now, Mrs. Thomas-Lowe and Ms. Lee are coordinating their plans in case Ms. Swift's surprise 3 a.m. announcement Friday reveals details of a new U.S. tour. If Ms. Lee falls asleep before then, Mrs. Thomas-Lowe will be prepared.</p><p>\"I'm definitely setting an alarm,\" Mrs. Thomas-Lowe said. \"I will be up for it.\"</p><p>Write to Jennifer Calfas at jennifer.calfas@wsj.com</p><p>Ahead of Taylor Swift's 'Midnights,' Swifties Take Naps, Set Alarms for Latest Night Yet</p>",
