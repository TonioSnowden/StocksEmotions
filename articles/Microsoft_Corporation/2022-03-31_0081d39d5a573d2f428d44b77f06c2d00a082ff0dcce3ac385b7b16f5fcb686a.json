  "title": "U.S. Senators Pressure FTC to Review Microsoft-Activision Merger; Sens. Warren, Sanders, Booker and Whitehouse say deal could undermine employees' calls for accountability over alleged misconduct at videogame maker",
  "text": "<p>\"We are deeply concerned about consolidation in the tech industry and its impact on workers,\" the letter says.</p><p>The senators note in their letter that the terms of the merger would enable Activision's longtime chief executive, Bobby Kotick, to continue in his role until the transaction's expected closing in 2023 and receive a potentially significant exit package upon his departure. Last summer, more than 1,800 Activision employees signed a letter calling on Mr. Kotick to resign.</p><p>\"This lack of accountability, despite shareholders, employees, and the public calling for Kotick to be held responsible for the culture he created, would be an unacceptable result of the proposed Microsoft acquisition,\" the letter says. If the FTC determines that the deal could worsen the negotiating position between workers and the companies, then the agency should oppose it, the letter says.</p><p>Activision and Microsoft didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>An Activision spokeswoman has previously said that the company has made significant changes to address company culture and create a safer environment for workplace complaints. Microsoft's videogame boss Phil Spencer has said he is confident that Activision management is addressing workplace issues.</p><p>Microsoft's roughly $75 billion deal for Activision is under review by the FTC, The Journal reported in February. Ms. Khan is expected to scrutinize whether the tech giant's move to expand its videogame business will substantially lessen competition.</p><p>All proposed mergers of substantial size must be submitted for government antitrust review, which is conducted by either the FTC or the Justice Department. Both agencies have closely scrutinized tech deals in the past.</p><p>Write to Sarah E.
