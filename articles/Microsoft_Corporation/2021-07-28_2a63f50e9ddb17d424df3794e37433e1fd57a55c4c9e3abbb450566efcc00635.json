  "title": "Microsoft  Sales Get  Lift From  Cloud  ----  By Meghan Bobrowsky",
  "text": "<p>    Microsoft Corp.'s success during the pandemic shows few signs of fading as its cloud-computing business delivered bumper sales growth to help the software maker post record revenue. </p><p>   Microsoft has been among the companies to enjoy big gains across its business from the working-from-home and remote-schooling period. Companies embraced digital services that run on the cloud and have been a centerpiece of Microsoft's growth. Personal computers have been flying off the shelf, many using the company's Windows software, and its videogame products have been in hot demand. </p><p>   The Redmond, Wash.-based company reported financial fourth-quarter sales of $46.2 billion after the bell Tuesday, up around 21% from the year-prior period. It generated a $16.5 billion profit for the period ended June 30, an increase of 47% year-over-year, exceeding Wall Street expectations. Analysts expected $44.1 billion in sales at a profit of $14.6 billion. </p><p>   Microsoft expects overall sales for the current quarter to reach up to $44.2 billion, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said on a call with analysts Tuesday. </p><p>   Shares turned positive in after-hours trading on the strong outlook. Microsoft's valuation now tops $2 trillion, second only to Apple Inc., whose rivalry with Microsoft has been rekindled in recent months. Microsoft's stock is up around 40% over the past year. </p><p>   Azure, Microsoft's collection of cloud data centers and software tools that has been the backbone of its growth in recent years, saw year-over-year sales growth of 51%, topping the 50% seen in the two prior quarters. Microsoft said it expects relatively stable growth in the current period. </p><p>   Microsoft's videogame business had been particularly supercharged, buoyed by the release of new Xbox game consoles and streaming-game services. Sales of Xbox content and services fell 4% in the most recent quarter. The sales growth in the year-prior quarter was 65% as people were stuck at home and flocked to videogames for entertainment. </p><p>   Overall gaming sales advanced 11%, down from 50% growth in the previous quarter. Xbox hardware revenue was up 172%, the company said. The new consoles are Microsoft's fastest selling Xbox machines, Ms. Hood said, with demand continuing to outpace supply. </p><p>   Surface laptop sales also declined, falling 20% from the year-ago period. They shot up during the pandemic due to remote work and distance learning. Ms. Hood warned in April that Surface laptop sales could be affected by the global chip shortage. </p><p>   Microsoft Tuesday said sales of its Windows operating system to computer makers that install the software on PCs dropped 3%, with device shipments affected by supply-chain issues. </p><p>   As the U.S. economy has started to ease some of its pandemic-era restrictions and offices have started to reopen, Microsoft has spelled out plans to try to carry its success into a period where hybrid work will be more common. </p><p>   In February, the company launched a set of apps with an eye on a work environment in which some employees are remote and others in the office. This month, it introduced a cloud-based version of its Windows operating system, accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, in part so people can shift easily between their office PCs and home digital devices. </p><p>   Microsoft expects more than 30% sales growth this quarter for LinkedIn. </p><p>   Microsoft also is giving its core Windows franchise a refresh. </p><p>   The company late last month launched Windows 11, the first new version in nearly six years. Revenue from Windows 11 won't be booked until later, though, when it becomes available to the wider public. </p><p>   Microsoft said it expects PC makers to start installing Windows 11 on devices in the current quarter. </p><p></p>",
