  "text": "<p>Stocks have gotten a boost in recent days, lifted by some better-than-expected corporate earnings and hopes that the Federal Reserve may reduce the pace of interest-rate increases. The rally propelled the Dow industrials to a six-week high on Tuesday.</p><p>Sentiment took a U-turn overnight after Alphabet and Microsoft reported their quarterly results on Tuesday after markets closed.</p><p>\"These companies are really important bellwethers on advertising and on flows of goods and services,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. \"If advertising growth is slowing over there, it is adding weight to that fear of an earnings slowdown.\"</p><p>Shares of Alphabet fell 7.4% in morning trading. The company's revenue growth last quarter dropped to the lowest level in more than two years and its YouTube video platform posted a drop in advertising sales for the first time.</p><p>Microsoft shares, meanwhile, declined 7.7% after the company reported its weakest revenue growth in more than five years and said it expects a sharp decline in personal computer sales.</p><p>\"We've gotten used to tech being strong in every single quarter. There was hope that they would be so sharp that it would be another signal that tech is resilient,\" said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank.</p><p>Earnings reports are due after the close from Meta Platforms and Ford Motor.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged down to 4.026% from 4.109% Tuesday.</p><p>The dollar weakened, with the WSJ Dollar Index down 0.7%.</p><p>Recent dollar selling by the Bank of Japan and Chinese state-owned banks to support their currencies is a likely driver of the dollar weakness, said Jordan Rochester, a foreign-exchange strategist at Nomura. \"A warmer October in Europe, the natural-gas market softening and some positivity for the European winter are also helping.\" The dollar is often bought as a haven in times of stress.</p><p>Bitcoin traded at its highest level since mid-September, rising to $20,668 before easing slightly.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged down 0.1%.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks rose. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.8% and Japan's Nikkei 225 added 0.7%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1%, regaining some ground after the index suffered its worst one-day drop since the global financial crisis earlier in the week.</p><p>-Karen Langley contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Nasdaq Drops After Weak Tech Earnings</p>",
