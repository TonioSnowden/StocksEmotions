  "text": "<p>Netflix on Tuesday reported its second consecutive quarter of subscriber losses and said it expects a less expensive, ad-supported version of the service to be available in early 2023. The company hopes that will help boost subscriber growth and revenue.</p><p>For years, advertisers were locked out of most of the biggest streaming services, where consumers were increasingly migrating as interest in traditional TV eroded. That is beginning to change: Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.'s HBO Max is now offering a plan with commercials, and Walt Disney Co.'s Disney+ is moving to do the same.</p><p>With about 220 million subscribers globally, Netflix is the biggest prize for advertisers, though it remains to be seen how many people will opt for the lower priced ad-supported tier once it becomes available. The company is also seeking to amend its programming deals with major entertainment studios to allow it to run content on the ad-supported tier, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.</p><p>\"It's a place we couldn't be before,\" said Angela Zepeda, chief marketing officer of Hyundai Motor America. \"And we want to be there.\"</p><p>Netflix last week said Microsoft Corp. would supply technology to facilitate the placement of video ads, but many advertisers are eager to see the degree of granularity with which they might be able to target specific viewers.</p><p>\"They give me exactly what I want when I don't know what I want to watch,\" said Shiv Singh, chief marketing officer of online-lending platform LendingTree Inc., of Netflix's show-recommendation engine. He said he sees big potential if the streaming service is able to do the same with ads.</p><p>\"One of the things Netflix does really well is personalizing,\" said Dara Treseder, Peloton's chief marketing officer.</p><p>Several advertisers have expressed interest in locking in multimillion-dollar long-term deals with Netflix, according to a major ad buyer -- a practice championed by Quibi, Hollywood mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg's now-defunct streaming service, which had signed ad deals valued at $150 million with blue-chip marketers in the run-up to its 2020 launch.</p><p>Marcel Marcondes, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA's global chief marketing officer, said he wants Netflix to reinvent advertising and do something that doesn't feel like typical commercials.</p><p>\"If they go straight to the traditional model, it's going to be the biggest failure ever,\" Mr. Marcondes said.</p><p>Hyundai's Ms. Zepeda said the car maker works closely with media companies such as Disney to develop ad partnerships that go far beyond just buying ad time and space across various networks and websites. She said she often looks for deals that include the ability to work with actors and or showrunners to create ads that tie into specific programs or arrange to have the company's vehicles appear or mentioned during shows.</p><p>Earlier this year, the company had the Ioniq 5, an electric sport-utility vehicle, integrated into \"Black-ish,\" a show that ran on Disney's ABC broadcast network. During the episode, Anthony Anderson, who plays an advertising executive on the show, worked on a faux Super Bowl commercial about the SUV.</p><p>Ad executives say that advertising is even more effective when viewers see a product within a show and then see a commercial for that very product shortly afterward. Studies have shown that when a product plug aired in the same program as standard commercials for the same brand, the ability for a consumer to remember the brand increased significantly.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
