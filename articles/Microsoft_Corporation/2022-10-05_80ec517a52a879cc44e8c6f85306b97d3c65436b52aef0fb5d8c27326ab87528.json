  "title": "Bridgewater  Founder  Dalio Hands  Over Control  ----  By Juliet Chung",
  "text": "<p>   Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio stepped down as co-investment chief of the largest U.S. hedge fund firm, nearly five decades after he started it in his Manhattan apartment. </p><p>   The move, finalized Friday following a tumultuous yearslong succession process, leaves a handful of Dalio associates in charge of the firm, which has $150 billion under management. Mr. Dalio remains on the board. </p><p>   The apparent winners in the succession drama are co-investment chiefs and Bridgewater veterans Bob Prince and Greg Jensen, who had a public falling out with Mr. Dalio, and co-Chief Executives Nir Bar Dea and Mark Bertolini, newer entrants on the scene who were named to their posts in January. But some cast Mr. Dalio as a winner, too, effecting a transition on his terms and timeline. </p><p>   Bridgewater had long told clients it had a 10-year transition plan in place intended to institutionalize the firm and move it away from one run by its charismatic founder. During the succession process, Bridgewater tried various chief executives, demoted Mr. Jensen after a power struggle with Mr. Dalio, was sued by its only female chief executive after she resigned and ran past the 10-year time frame Mr. Dalio had spoken of in transitioning leadership. </p><p>   \"The transition of Bridgewater from Ray is done!\" wrote Messrs. Bar Dea and Bertolini, the firm's co-chief executives, in a note to employees Tuesday to mark an occasion some veteran employees had doubted would ever arrive. </p><p>   Bridgewater in February had said the change of control from Mr. Dalio to the board had been signed but that regulatory and other steps needed to be taken before the transaction closed. </p><p>   In a LinkedIn post Tuesday, the 73-year-old Mr. Dalio wrote that the succession process of the last 12 years hadn't been easy, but that \"I feel great about the people and 'machine' now in control . . . I can now visualize it as doing great things for generations without me.\" </p><p></p>",
