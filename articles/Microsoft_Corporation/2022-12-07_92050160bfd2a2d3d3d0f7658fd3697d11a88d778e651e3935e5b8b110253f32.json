  "text": "<p>Microsoft is awaiting federal approval of its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision.</p><p>A deal to share one of Activision's ATVI most lucrative videogame titles could appease some antitrust concerns from regulators. Spencer told Bloomberg News that a similar offer had been extended to rival Sony Corp. SONY for its PlayStation consoles, but said that offer had so far been rebuffed.</p><p>A \"Call of Duty\" title has not been available on Nintendo since 2013.</p><p>In an interview with the Washington Post published Tuesday, Spencer said there was no Nintendo \"Call of Duty\" release date set yet, but that if the merger closes — it has a June 2023 target date — future \"Call of Duty\" games would be released for all platforms at once. \"Once we get into the rhythm of this, our plan would be that when [a Call of Duty game] launches on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, that it would also be available on Nintendo at the same time,\" he told the Post.</p><p>Nintendo shares JP:7974 rose slightly in Tokyo trading following the news. Microsoft shares MSFT fell Monday, and are down 17% year to date, compared to the S&amp;P 500's SPX 17% decline this year.</p><p>Microsoft to bring 'Call of Duty' to Nintendo if Activision merger approved</p>",
