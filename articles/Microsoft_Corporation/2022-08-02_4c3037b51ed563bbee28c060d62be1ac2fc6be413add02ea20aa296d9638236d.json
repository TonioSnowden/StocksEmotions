  "title": "Technology:  Pinterest to Watch Spending  As Advertising Market Softens  ----  By Sarah E. Needleman",
  "text": "<p>   Pinterest Inc.'s new Chief Executive Bill Ready said he was going to emphasize profitability as he puts his imprint on the company at a time when the weakened digital-advertising market has dented sales growth for the social-media platform and its peers. </p><p>   \"I do not subscribe to a growth-at-all-costs mentality,\" Mr. Ready said on a call with analysts, adding he would scrutinize spending to boost profitability next year. \"While I believe we need to invest in long-term growth, I also believe that constraints breed creativity and can lead to even better product outcomes.\" </p><p>   Mr. Ready on Monday got a shot in the arm from activist investor Elliott Management Corp., which said it was now the company's largest shareholder. The firm has taken a stake of more than 9% in Pinterest, The Wall Street Journal reported last month. Elliott is known as one of Wall Street's toughest activist investors, with a history of taking on tech companies and others and forcing changes such as sales or executive shake-ups. </p><p>   Elliott called Mr. Ready \"the right leader to oversee Pinterest's next phase of growth.\" </p><p>   Mr. Ready said he viewed Elliott's investment as \"a vote of confidence.\" </p><p>   Shares in Pinterest rose more than 20% in after-hours trading following a period in which investors had grown downbeat on social-media companies. </p><p>   The San Francisco company said revenue rose 9% to $666 million for the quarter that ended in June, in line with what analysts polled by FactSet were expecting. Though Pinterest has been working in recent years to move into e-commerce, all its revenue still comes from digital advertising. </p><p>   Pinterest joins the expanding ranks of tech companies that are trying to keep a tighter control on some spending and has moved to slow the pace of hiring significantly, finance chief Todd Morgenfeld said in an interview. Microsoft Corp., Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and Twitter Inc. are among those to take similar action in recent weeks. </p><p>   The company on Monday issued a muted sales outlook, projecting mid-single-digit revenue growth for the current quarter, in part, Mr. Morgenfeld said, as it anticipates a slowdown in coming weeks. Wall Street has been projecting growth above 10%. The sales forecast, the company said, partly reflects a more difficult exchange-rate environment from the strong dollar. </p><p>   Last week, Google parent Alphabet Inc. reported the slowest quarterly sales growth in two years. The following day, Meta posted its first decline in revenue. Both blamed upheaval in the digital-advertising market as a factor. </p><p>   Pinterest operates a free platform for sharing images that inspire projects such as planning weddings, completing home renovations and creating recipes. The company has been struggling to recapture the rapid growth it experienced during the pandemic now that people are spending more time offline. </p><p>   Pinterest reported a net loss of $43 million, or 7 cents a share, compared with year-ago earnings of $69 million, or 10 cents a share. </p><p>   Pinterest said it had 433 million monthly active users in the second quarter, about the same as in the first quarter and down 5% from a year earlier. The company said its user numbers suffered in part because Google late last year changed its search algorithm and as people break with some of their pandemic-era online habits. </p><p></p>",
