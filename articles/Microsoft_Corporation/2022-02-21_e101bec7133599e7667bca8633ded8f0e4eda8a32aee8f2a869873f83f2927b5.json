  "text": "<p>Good afternoon from London. When it comes to hybrid working, have you tried the ‘third space': not the office, not the home but somewhere in-between?

Dan Cable of London Business School <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/538f3649-8a30-4b35-a2ee-bd1392180b25\">tells my colleague Janina Conboye</a> that shared working spaces are a “specific, practical, affordable solution” to the challenges of hybrid work.</p> <blockquote>  <p>For my <strong>management challenge</strong> this week, I want to hear your best, and worst, experiences of “third space” working, be it the paid, formal type (think WeWork) or the casual (your local Starbucks). Send your tales of woe or joy to <strong>bschool@ft.com</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Two weeks ago, I asked whether a new management structure could change corporate culture. Daniel Forrester and Jerold Zimmerman, authors of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Relentless-Forensics-Mobsters-Business-Practices-ebook/dp/B08LQWSNHD\">Relentless</a>, about mobsters' business practices, point out that, on its own, a reorganisation is likely to be ineffective. It is only one of four “pillars” that organised crime syndicates use to motivate criminals, the others being performance measures, rewards and punishments, and culture itself. “MBAs would be wise to study these groups,” they suggest.</p> <p>In <strong>further reading</strong>, a <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/bionic-eye-obsolete\">shocking tale</a> of technological obsolescence and management failure from Eliza Strickland and Mark Harris, writing for IEEE Spectrum. They recount how owners of high-tech implants that helped blind people to achieve partial vision discovered that the company that developed the implants was teetering and had abandoned the technology. The plight of the company, Second Sight, and its customers “provides a cautionary tale for bold entrepreneurs interested in brain tech”, they write.</p> <h2>Data line: MBA alumni from Asia-Pacific outnumber north Americans</h2> <p>The percentage of alumni from the Asia-Pacific region who studied at schools participating in the MBA ranking 2022 has overtaken those from North America.</p> <p>The proportion of women is up from 33 per cent to 40 per cent since 2006 and the number of graduates overall going into finance and banking has fallen significantly, <em>write Sam Stephens and Leo Cremonezi</em>.</p> <p>Further analysis of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49cc2adf-485a-4752-b4d0-5aacbc437171\">FT's MBA 2022 ranking can be found&#xa0;here</a>.</p> <h2>Work and careers round-up</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0b90040-f7d1-400c-8c8d-4f5fc2515d4b\">Pushing boundaries: the rise of German business schools</a> The country had no tradition of teaching management but its elite schools are now booming. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9463ed05-c847-425d-9051-482bd3a1e4b1\">Metaverse vs employment law: the reality of the virtual workplace</a> It is unclear how employee protections apply in the universal digital realm.
