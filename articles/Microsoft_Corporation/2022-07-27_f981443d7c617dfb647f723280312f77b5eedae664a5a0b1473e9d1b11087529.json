  "title": "Stock Futures Rise Ahead of Fed Decision; Growth stocks climbed premarket, as investors cheered results from megacap tech companies",
  "text": "<p>Shares of megacap technology companies jumped in premarket trading, after Microsoft and Google parent Alphabet on Tuesday afternoon reported earnings that were better than investors feared.</p><p>Microsoft, despite suffering its slowest earnings growth in two years, gave an upbeat outlook for its full-year guidance, sending shares 3.8% higher premarket. Alphabet shares advanced 3.5% before the opening bell after its results, which showed slowing sales growth, came in better than investors expected.</p><p>This week is a pivotal and busy week in financial markets, and traders around the world are awaiting an interest-rate decision from the Fed. The U.S. central bank is expected to lift its federal-funds rate by 0.75 percentage point, to a range between 2.25% and 2.5%, Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>Investors will be watching for any clues from central bankers on the size of further interest-rate increases this yearâ€”and whether they believe they will then turn around and begin cutting rates next year.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged up to 2.794%, from 2.786% Tuesday. Yields rise when bond prices fall. The yield on the two-year note, meanwhile, rose to 3.053%, from 3.041% the day before.</p><p>Short-term yields have been elevated this year as investors have prepared for the Fed to keep aggressively raising interest rates, keeping the U.S. Treasury yield curve inverted. That signal is often seen as a key recession predictor.</p><p>Investors have grown increasingly worried that the Fed could plunge the U.S. into a recession through tighter policy. Second-quarter gross-domestic product data on Thursday will provide insight into the economy's recent performance.</p><p>Investors are also monitoring earnings results this week, the busiest of the earnings season, for clues about how companies are navigating decades-high inflation. Results from companies including Boeing, Sherwin-Williams and Shopify are due Wednesday morning. Qualcomm and Facebook parent Meta Platforms will report after Wednesday's close.</p><p>Shares of growth and technology companies rallied in premarket trading. PayPal Holdings jumped 5.5% after The Wall Street Journal reported that activist investor Elliott Management Corp. has a stake in the company. Meta climbed 2.2%, while Nvidia gained 2.5%. Peloton Interactive, a pandemic-era darling, advanced 3.3%.</p><p>Investors in recent weeks have piled back into beaten-down technology companies, helping the Nasdaq Composite trim its year-to-date losses to 26%, based on Tuesday's close. It has still fared worse than the S&amp;P 500, which has lost 18% for the year.</p><p>Spotify Technology shares climbed 2.8% premarket after the music-streaming giant reported accelerated user growth and a rise in advertising revenue for the second quarter. Hilton Worldwide Holdings shares jumped 2.8% premarket after the hotel chain raised its full-year earnings guidance.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 advanced 0.4%. Credit Suisse shares added 0.9% after the Swiss bank named a new chief executive and reported earnings that were worse than analysts expected. Shares of Deutsche Bank fell 3.5% after the bank, which reported a sharp rise in second-quarter profit, warned the months aheadwill be challenging.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 0.2% to $99.66 a barrel. European natural-gas prices jumped amid ongoing worries about dwindling Russian oil supplies and fears of supply shortages this winter. Benchmark gas futures climbed 12% to about 228 euros a megawatt hour, equivalent to about $231.17, according to FactSet. Prices have now jumped about 37% this week.</p><p>In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 1.1%, while China's Shanghai Composite lost about 0.1%. Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.2%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Rise Ahead of Fed Decision</p>",
