  "title": "Stocks Decline as Inflation Soars --- Rising bond yields threaten technology and other fast- growing sectors",
  "text": "<p>(WSJ Nov. 12, 2021)</p><p>(END)</p><p>Stocks fell after data showing that inflation hit a three-decade high added to investors' concerns about price pressures in the economy.</p><p>Shares of technology and other fast-growing companies lagged behind the broader market as rising bond yields threatened the value of far-off earnings.</p><p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 dropped 38.54 points, or 0.8%, to 4646.71, a second down day after an eight-session streak of record closes. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 240.04 points, or 0.7%, to 36079.94. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 263.84 points, or 1.7%, to 15622.71.</p><p>Investors' eyes were on data showing U.S. inflation rose in October to its highest level since 1990, driven by supply shortages and strong consumer demand. The annual rate of inflation stood at 6.2%.</p><p>Yields on shorter-term U.S. government bonds rose, suggesting bond investors expect the increases in consumer prices may prompt the Federal Reserve to more quickly raise interest rates. The yield on the two-year Treasury note rose to 0.503%, from 0.409% Tuesday. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.558%. Yields rise as bond prices fall.</p><p>Stocks have charted a rapid course higher in recent weeks, boosted by a strong batch of corporate earnings. Markets are showing \"stubborn resilience\" despite inflation concerns and the prospect of tightening monetary policy, said Aoifinn Devitt, chief investment officer at Moneta Group.</p><p>\"Inflation is very much here, and arguably not transitory, but markets don't seem to be too concerned about that,\" she said.</p><p>The inflation data show that companies have succeeded in passing price increases on to consumers, said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer at Northern Trust Wealth Management.</p><p>\"Large public companies have pricing power,\" she said. \"Inflation is not necessarily a bad thing for stocks, particularly if the Fed doesn't react.\"</p><p>Energy stocks were the worst-performing sector in the S&amp;P 500, dropping 3% as oil prices declined. Technology stocks also fell, with Apple shares down $2.89, or 1.9%, to $147.92 and Microsoft shares down $5.15, or 1.5%, to $330.80. Rising yields tend to hurt tech stocks, which often trade at high prices based in part on projections of growth far into the future.</p><p>\"The higher interest rates are, the less valuable those future cash flows, those future earnings, are for growth stocks,\" said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer at Mercer Advisors.</p><p>Among individual stocks, shares of Coinbase Global fell $28.79, or 8.1%, to $328.60 after the cryptocurrency exchange reported earnings late Tuesday that missed analysts' expectations. DoorDash shares rose $22.23, or 12%, to $214.24 after the company said it had agreed to buy Finnish food-delivery firm Wolt Enterprises in a deal valued at over $8 billion.</p><p>Shares of electric-vehicle startup Rivian Automotive jumped in their market debut, rising 29% from the initial public offering price.</p><p>Chinese economic data released Wednesday added to inflation concerns. Factory-gate prices in China rose at a record pace in October, due in part to surging energy costs.</p><p>Early Thursday, the Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.6%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 0.1% and Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.75%. U.S. stock futures were up 0.2%.</p>",
