  "title": "Apple and Microsoft market caps reached their largest spread on record — at roughly Tesla's entire valuation; Apple's stock gained after earnings as company called out strength in iPhone demand, but Microsoft's stock fell amid cloud concerns",
  "text": "<p>The spread has narrowed a bit with Monday morning's trading action, as Apple shares are off 1.8% and Microsoft shares are down 1.5%. Apple's market value is now $698.40 billion larger than Microsoft's, with that spread again similar to Tesla's current valuation.</p><p>While Apple shares rallied 7.6% in Friday trading after the company posted a large revenue beat in its Mac segment and indicated that iPhone demand was strong despite supply challenges, Microsoft shares lost 7.7% Wednesday as the company's most recent earnings report fueled concerns about cloud growth.</p><p>Opinion: The cloud boom has hit its stormiest moment yet, and it is costing investors billions</p><p>Combined, Apple's and Microsoft's market caps made up 42% of the market cap of all Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA components as of Friday's close.</p><p>Apple's price-to-earnings ratio on a next-12-months basis is also higher than Microsoft's in a somewhat rare occurrence. While the smartphone giant's forward P/E has been higher than Microsoft's during several days in September and October, it hadn't been above Microsoft's before those instances since January 2021, per Dow Jones Market Data, based on FactSet data.</p><p>Apple had a 24.48 P/E ahead of Monday's open, while Microsoft's was 23.25.</p><p>Shares of both names remain down on the year, however, with Microsoft's stock off 31% over the course of 2022 and Apple's off 14%. Together, Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc. have shed $3 trillion in market value so far this year.</p><p>Apple and Microsoft market caps reached their largest spread on record — at roughly Tesla's entire valuation</p>",
