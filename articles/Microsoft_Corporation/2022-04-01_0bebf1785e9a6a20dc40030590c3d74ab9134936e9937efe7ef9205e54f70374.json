  "title": "Four Senators Cite  Concern on Deal  ----  By Sarah E. Needleman",
  "text": "<p>   Four U.S. senators sent a letter Thursday to the Federal Trade Commission citing concern about Microsoft Corp.'s proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc., saying the deal could undermine employees' calls for accountability over alleged misconduct at the videogame company. </p><p>   In the letter, viewed by The Wall Street Journal, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), Cory Booker (D., N.J.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.) urge FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan to assess whether the planned transaction could exacerbate the flurry of sexual-abuse, harassment and retaliation allegations at Activision stemming from recent federal and state investigations. </p><p>   \"We are deeply concerned about consolidation in the tech industry and its impact on workers,\" the letter says. </p><p>   The senators note in their letter that the terms of the merger would enable Activision's longtime chief executive, Bobby Kotick, to continue in his role until the transaction's expected closing in 2023 and receive a potentially significant exit package upon his departure. Last summer, more than 1,800 Activision employees signed a letter calling on Mr. Kotick to resign. </p><p>   \"This lack of accountability, despite shareholders, employees, and the public calling for Kotick to be held responsible for the culture he created, would be an unacceptable result of the proposed Microsoft acquisition,\" the letter says. </p><p>   If the commission determines that the deal could worsen the negotiating position between workers and the companies, then the agency should oppose it, the letter says. </p><p>   An Activision spokeswoman said the transaction between Microsoft and Activision won't interrupt any of the actions that Activision's leadership team implemented last year and so far this year with regards to improving its workplace. </p><p>   \"This is a compelling transaction for all stakeholders, including employees,\" she said, adding that no additional special compensation arrangements were made for Mr. Kotick in connection with the transaction. </p><p>   Microsoft corporate vice president and general counsel Lisa Tanzi said workplace culture is a critical priority for the company. \"We believe Activision Blizzard will continue making progress, and we're committed to further progress after the deal closes,\" she said. </p><p></p>",
