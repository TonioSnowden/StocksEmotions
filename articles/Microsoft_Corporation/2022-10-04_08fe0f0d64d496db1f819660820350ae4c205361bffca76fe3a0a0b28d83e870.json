  "title": "Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio Hands Over Control of Firm; Dalio steps down as co-investment chief of hedge-fund firm, remains on board",
  "text": "<p>The apparent winners in the Bridgewater succession drama are co-investment chiefs and Bridgewater veterans Bob Prince and Greg Jensen, who had a public falling out with Mr. Dalio, and co-chief executives Nir Bar Dea and Mark Bertolini, newer entrants on the scene who were named to their posts in January. But some cast Mr. Dalio as a winner, too, effecting a transition on his terms and timeline.</p><p>Bridgewater had long told clients it had a 10-year transition plan in place intended to institutionalize the firm and move it away from one run by its charismatic founder. During the succession process, Bridgewater tried various chief executives; demoted Mr. Jensen after a power struggle with Mr. Dalio; was sued by its only female chief executive after she resigned; and ran past the 10-year time frame Mr. Dalio had spoken of in transitioning leadership of the firm.</p><p>\"The transition of Bridgewater from Ray is done!\" wrote Messrs. Bar Dea and Bertolini, the firm's co-chief executives, in a note to employees Tuesday to mark an occasion some veteran employees had doubted would ever arrive.</p><p>Bridgewater in February had said the change of control from Mr. Dalio to the board of directors had been signed but that regulatory and other steps needed to be taken before the transaction closed.</p><p>Bridgewater has been working on the process since and, \"On Friday, we finished the work, signed the papers, and closed. The control of the company now sits with our Operating Board. There is nothing left to do on Ray's transition. It's done,\" the note said. Mr. Dalio's voting rights have been transferred to the board, said a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>In a LinkedIn message Tuesday, Mr. Dalio wrote the succession process of the last 12 years hadn't been easy, but that \"I feel great about the people and 'machine' now in control... I can now visualize it as doing great things for generations without me. That's as good as it gets.\" He also wrote that he hoped to continue to invest, mentor and act as a board member at Bridgewater.</p><p>Bloomberg News earlier reported the news that the transition was complete.</p><p>Write to Juliet Chung at juliet.chung@wsj.com</p><p>Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio Hands Over Control of Firm</p>",
