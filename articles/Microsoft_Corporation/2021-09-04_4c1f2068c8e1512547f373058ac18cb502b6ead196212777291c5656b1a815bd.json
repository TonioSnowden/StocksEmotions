  "title": "REVIEW --- Can Hospitals Learn About Safety From Airlines? --- A new proposal for a National Patient Safety Board aims to reduce medical errors by using techniques that have almost eliminated fatal airplane crashes.",
  "text": "<p>Determined to do better, healthcare leaders are now doubling down on aviation's lead. A coalition of experts organized by the Pittsburgh-based Jewish Healthcare Foundation has drafted a proposal to create a National Patient Safety Board, patterned after the independent National Transportation Safety Board that dissects the chain of events leading to aircraft accidents. The stand-alone board would find novel ways to apply the lessons learned in air passenger safety to patient safety, aiming to reduce the most persistent and serious types of diagnostic, surgical and pharmaceutical mistakes.</p><p>At the heart of the idea is prodding doctors and hospitals to share more digital data and wholeheartedly embrace self-reporting of their potentially deadly \"near misses,\" the way that pilots already do without fear of punishment. Some advocates envision aggregating and studying incident data while protecting the identities of individual physicians. The board, in effect, would serve as a national clearinghouse for huge volumes of data, employing apolitical experts to analyze the information, look for patterns and issue nonbinding recommendations to reduce errors.</p><p>More than 40 participants have formally joined or expressed interest in the coalition, including universities, insurance companies like Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, business groups like the National Retail Federation and activist organizations such as Mothers Against Medical Errors and the Leapfrog Group, a private watchdog organization that grades hospitals on safety.</p><p>The proposal remains at a formative stage. No final budget projections or legislative language has yet been drafted, and the concept has received scant public attention, though organizers have begun to look for support on Capitol Hill. Announcement of the initiative is expected as early as next week.</p><p>As long as hospital equipment isn't designed to guard against human slip-ups, as jetliner cockpits are, \"it will be far too easy to crash the plane in healthcare,\" says Dr. Jonathan Gleason, executive vice president and chief quality officer at Philadelphia-based Jefferson Health. Worried that recruiting enough experts who understand the problem will be difficult, Dr. Gleason says \"there really is the need for a moonshot to fill that gap.\"</p><p>Inadequate information-sharing between hospitals and among specialists can threaten patient safety, says Sue Sheridan, a professional patient advocate who supports the new plan and is helping to launch a separate patient safety group. \"A lot of egregious errors may not be captured in data\" unless the system changes, she warns.</p><p>A further obstacle is that financial incentives for hospitals \"are still not aligned around quality and safety,\" says Dr. David Mayer, who runs the safety research arm of the Maryland-based hospital chain MedStar. Typical billing practices, he says, \"track the number and complexity of procedures instead of the outcomes.\"</p><p>One element of air safety that has already made big inroads in medicine is reliance on checklists, in large part thanks to Dr. Atul Gawande's 2009 bestselling book \"The Checklist Manifesto.\" But Raj Ratwani, director of MedStar Health's National Center for Human Factors in Healthcare, believes that the usefulness of medical checklists has been oversold. \"They have gotten us only 20% of the way,\" Mr. Ratwani says, \"and we need to go way beyond that.\"</p><p>The proposed NPSB wouldn't focus on investigating individual patient fatalities, the way the NTSB does with airline crashes. Instead, it would coordinate with the host of government organizations already tracking patient safety to pinpoint and counter budding dangers, including surgical complications, medical equipment shortcomings and adverse drug reactions.</p><p>The safety push can benefit from the \"explosion in methods for analyzing large quantities of data,\" according to Eric Horvitz, Microsoft Corp.'s chief scientific officer, who favors the idea of the new board and has attended some planning sessions.</p><p>Problems arising from human-machine interactions are another topic requiring sophisticated analysis. \"I'm not seeing that in healthcare nearly to the extent I see it in aviation,\" says Christopher Hart, a former NTSB chairman involved in discussions of the proposed entity. Currently, he says, healthcare tends to disregard the issue, which is akin to \"teaching people to drive better on icy roads, but not doing anything about the icy roads.\"</p><p>The central question, says Karen Wolk Feinstein, president and chief executive of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, is \"who is going to make it possible to use all these data sources\" to help protect patients? The goal of the new board would be to reveal the full extent of problems hidden by today's scattered safety statistics. \"Information sharing in healthcare is pitiful compared to aviation,\" according to Mr. Hart.</p><p>In theory, federal and state regulators already monitor poor safety outcomes and sometimes punish them financially. California and Washington, for example, require hospitals to report adverse events, though information about precursors and root causes usually isn't disclosed. Dozens of federally sponsored databases collect disparate patient safety information. Those systems could be unified, while maintaining the anonymity of physicians who voluntarily report problems.</p><p>Skeptics point out that even if the NPSB is created, there would be significant disincentives for doctors and hospitals to report their own errors. Malpractice suits and federal funding cuts discourage providers from being open about missteps. \"It's not good for business to get mistakes out there, that's the bottom line,\" says Kathleen Bartholomew, a nurse and former hospital administrator who has written extensively on the subject. Truly transparent data sharing would require a \"massive cultural change,\" she says.</p><p>When medical errors are reported, it's usually \"well after the fact, and information usually stays within the organization,\" says Dr. Charles Pilcher, a retired emergency-room physician who publishes a patient safety newsletter. \"Confidentiality certainly never helped improve aviation safety,\" he adds.</p><p>It's too soon to tell whether stepped-up lobbying will generate more traction on Capitol Hill or persuade the Biden administration to endorse the concept. Similar campaigns have stalled in the past due to opposition from physician and hospital groups.</p><p>Proponents are convinced, however, that this time will be different. Challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic have opened the door to innovation in healthcare, and the latest effort has found a receptive audience among some lawmakers and numerous healthcare providers. The Council of Medical Specialty Societies, for instance, has engaged in discussions with leaders of the coalition.</p><p>Robert Sumwalt, another former NTSB chairman supportive of the general concept and involved in the discussions, says \"I am convinced, and others should be convinced, that the current state of medical error is totally unacceptable.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Pasztor, a former aviation reporter for The Wall Street Journal, is writing a book about the history of air safety.</p><p>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: Hospital Surgeons Could Use Co-Pilots' Help\" -- WSJ September 23, 2021)</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
