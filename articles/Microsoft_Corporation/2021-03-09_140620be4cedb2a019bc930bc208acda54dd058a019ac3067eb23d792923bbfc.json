  "title": "Tech Veteran Oracle's Low Bar Is Rising",
  "text": "<p>The 43-year-old software giant heads into its fiscal third quarter report this week in the rare position of being the hottest tech stock around. By Monday's close, Oracle shares had jumped 9% over the past week and are up more than 14% over the past month. That makes it a notable standout in a market that has suddenly taken to disfavoring many tech names -- the Nasdaq is down around 10% over the past month.</p><p>Investors generally have been spooked by rising bond yields, and have been rotating out of high-valued names into more downtrodden ones. Oracle could certainly qualify as the latter, with its stock commanding less than 14 times forward earnings just a month ago -- one of the lowest multiples in the software category.</p><p>Oracle, however, is believed to be at the beginning of an improving cycle of growth, as more of its traditional software business has slowly transitioned to the cloud. When the company reports results Wednesday afternoon, Wall Street expects revenue of $10 billion for the quarter ended February -- up nearly 3% year over year. That sounds anemic next to the double-digit growth rates that even bigger software players like Microsoft and Amazon.com's AWS cloud computing business have been generating of late. But it would be Oracle's best growth rate in three years. The past four quarters averaged a decline of 0.2%.</p><p>Investors should note Oracle has a mixed record when it comes to pleasing Wall Street. The stock price dropped following eight of the past 12 quarterly reports, according to FactSet. Still, last year's third-quarter report sparked the stock's biggest single-day gain in more than a decade, as better-than-expected results came with a boosted share buyback program. This time around, Oracle's growth will need to speak louder than its checkbook.</p>",
