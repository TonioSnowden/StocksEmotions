  "title": "Stocks Close Higher on Final Day of Tumultuous Month; Despite Monday gains, S&P suffers worst monthly performance since March 2020",
  "text": "<p>The central bank last week signaled that it would begin steadily raising rates in mid-March. Adding to investors' anxieties in recent weeks: the possibility of a Russian invasion of Ukraine and the surge of the Omicron variant of Covid-19.</p><p>The suite of concerns has led to declines across the stock market, with 10 of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors retreating in the new year. Only energy stocks have bucked the downward trend.</p><p>\"January really snuck up on a lot of people,\" said Wayne Wicker, chief investment officer at MissionSquare Retirement. \"Everybody was predicting volatility, but I think the declines in January probably exceeded expectations.\"</p><p>The shift by the Federal Reserve unsettles a key support for stocks. Investors credit the central bank's near-zero short-term interest rates and program of bond-buying with helping fuel the stock market's run from its lows of March 2020. Even after pulling back in recent weeks, the S&amp;P 500 is trading at about double its closing low that month.</p><p>On the final trading day of January, the S&amp;P 500 advanced 1.9%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%, or about 406 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced 3.4%, chipping away at its monthly losses. The day's gains built on a rally Fridayfor all three indexes.</p><p>Technology stocks have slumped this month as investors consider how rising interest rates could weigh especially hard on the group's pricey valuations, which are based in part on expectations for growth far into the future. Microsoft shares have dropped 7.5% in January, while Nvidia shares have slumped 17%.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite has fallen 9% this month, making January its worst month since March 2020.</p><p>\"Tech was just very highly valued, very overbought,\" said Dustin Thackeray, chief investment officer at Crewe Advisors. \"It was certainly due for a pullback.\"</p><p>Trading in January has featured big days both up and down, as well as sharp intraday reversals.</p><p>\"There has been extreme volatility so far this year,\" said Louise Dudley, an equities portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. \"People are particularly worried with the interest-rate expectations continuing to get higher. We're definitely seeing from the U.S. that they're very on top of the inflation numbersâ€”they're going to do everything they can.\"</p><p>Ms. Dudley said she expects that volatility will lessen as investors get more clarity over whether inflation has peaked and how companies expect to be impacted by higher prices for energy, labor and materials.</p><p>Investors are listening for clues about companies' expectations as corporate earnings season continues. Analysts expect that profits from companies in the S&amp;P 500 rose 24% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, according to FactSet. About one-third of companies in the index have reported.</p><p>Strong earnings reports, coupled with the depth of the stock-price declines in January, make some investors think the market may rise from here.</p><p>\"I think there's a good chance that last week marked a short-term bottom,\" said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \"The fundamentals have not validated the weakness\"</p><p>Among individual stocks, shares of Netflix jumped 11% Monday after a ratings upgrade from Citigroup and share purchases by Co-Chief Executive Reed Hastings.</p><p>U.S.-listed shares of Sony rose 4.5% after Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC said it is buyingvideogame developer Bungie. Earlier in January Microsoft said it would buy videogame giant Activision Blizzard.</p><p>Citrix Systems shares fell 3.4% as the cloud-computing company said it would be taken private in an all-cash acquisition valued at $16.5 billion.</p><p>Shares of L3Harris Technologies dropped 4.3% after the aerospace and defense company gave a downbeat revenue outlook.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was little changed, edging up to 1.780% Monday from 1.779% Friday. But the monthly yield gain was the largest since March 2021.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 gained 0.7%. In Asia, markets were closed in China and South Korea for a holiday. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Japan's Nikkei 225 each added more than 1%.</p><p>Macau Legend Development shares fell 19% in Hong Kong after media reports of the arrest of its chief executive over the weekend, on suspicion of money laundering and illegal gambling, including operating online casinos.</p><p>Write to Karen Langley at karen.langley@wsj.com and Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Close Higher on Final Day of Tumultuous Month</p>",
