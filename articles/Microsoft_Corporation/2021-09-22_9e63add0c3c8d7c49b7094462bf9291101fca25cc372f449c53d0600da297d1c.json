  "title": "Hybrid headaches: businesses grapple with new ways of working",
  "text": "<p>Good evening from London, where our newsroom is a little fuller than usual, as we take a look at one of the hottest topics for our readers and the companies they work for: the return to the office.</p> <p>BEIS, the UK's business department, publishes a consultation document tomorrow on new rights for workers to request flexible hours <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4b1c7fa-04ba-44da-913d-668b9c59ad96\">from their first day in a job</a>.</p> <p>The paper, which will address part-time work, working from home and job shares, comes as companies start getting to grips with the logistical difficulties thrown up by new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/403bbd57-5e9f-4285-9934-6292e9715612\">hybrid arrangements</a>. </p> <p>Businesses have to work out how to get teams in the office at the same time and in sync with overlapping departments, while workers are concerned with more pressing problems such as “What if I forget my phone charger?” and “Do I really have to keep carting round this heavy laptop?” As a recent report from Microsoft put it: “Most organisations are not prepared. Hybrid work is hard.”</p> <p>“The only way we will know what's going to work is by piloting things, by experimenting,” argues an executive at Tate &amp; Lyle, the food group. “People are looking for cookie-cutter approaches — ‘Is it two days, is it three [in the office]? What's the magic number?' People are pulling their hair out.”</p> <p>HR departments are in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2adccf19-e1fb-4c65-a6e4-c00f99d49548\">uncharted territory</a>, especially given the enhanced bargaining power of workers at a time of staff shortages. Should companies reconcile themselves to more of their staff working from home? And if they want their workers back, how should they go about it — with carrot or stick? </p> <p>Some companies are offering treats and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9923608-f931-47fe-9a97-822f01140843\">better designed spaces</a> to make work more of a fun and engaging experience. “You can't expect to force people back to the office, you have to provide a hook,” says one executive at a property group. </p> <p>Meanwhile, back in our London newsroom, there seems to be some anecdotal evidence at least that the carrot (cake) and stick approach is paying dividends.</p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katie_martin_fx/status/1440604281669783558\">https://twitter.com/katie_martin_fx/status/1440604281669783558</a> <p><em>Read more in our special report: </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/future-workplace\"><em>The Future of the Workplace</em></a></p> <p><em>What is your company proposing to get you back in the office?

Our chief economics commentator Martin Wolf examines the dilemma facing all <strong>central banks</strong>, arguing that the exceptional policies of 2020 can <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b65d2c0-251c-467d-b924-42f0c78c3d34\">no longer be justified</a>.</p> <p>The <strong>gas price crisis</strong> (see <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/223d5dd1-4212-4e47-8c7b-b54b53744ab2\">last issue</a>) shows no sign of easing. The UK's carbon dioxide shortage is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/475ca564-66b1-49b7-b6ce-f6f682deeac8\">spreading to Europe</a>; British Steel warned that power prices were “spiralling out of control”, making it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49f37d21-841b-4230-bab2-667c530e5792\">impossible to produce steel</a> at certain times of day; and the International Energy Agency urged Russia to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb231586-7214-44af-99c2-b42ee408e206\">increase gas supplies</a> to Europe. There was better news for the food industry as the UK agreed to (temporarily) bail out one of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/991db1b7-ab0e-49fb-999c-3bf5bef2a93a\">closed fertiliser plants</a> belonging to CF Industries that produce much of the country's CO2 supplies.</p> <h1>Latest for the UK/Europe</h1> <p>Benefit cuts combined with rocketing energy and food bills mean <strong>Britain's poorer households</strong> face a serious <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11ef63ba-63db-46f2-a399-1c7323d54509\">cost of living crisis</a>. Consumer editor Claer Barrett has some advice for families and small businesses on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03cc8c0b-1035-457a-95f9-025ec13a4855\">how to cope</a> with the energy price shock. </p> <h1>Global latest</h1> <p><strong>Pfizer</strong> and <strong>BioNTech</strong> said they would provide <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0bf2959-2c2a-4085-ba5d-ab445de72c7c\">1bn coronavirus vaccine doses</a> through the US to poor countries at cost price, ahead of a vaccine summit headed by President Joe Biden today. Just 2 per cent of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose of any vaccine. </p> <p>The <strong>OECD</strong>, echoed by the vice-president of the European Central Bank, issued a new warning on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55300c7b-ab06-40c4-a5f4-ed02ddb31374\">risks of rising inflation</a>. The OECD now expects price increases to be significantly higher in 2021 and in 2022 than it previously forecast.</p> <p>Covid-19 outbreaks due to <strong>low vaccination rates</strong> are holding back recovery in certain <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2db2b47d-3eaa-4cc0-b933-3c7356e3dbd0\">south-east Asian countries</a>. The Asian Development Bank has cut growth forecasts for Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam while raising forecasts for China, Taiwan and South Korea.</p> <p>There was more encouraging news from a UN report that said <strong>investment in innovation</strong> increased last year in spite of (or because of) the pandemic as governments and businesses upped their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba108fd5-7541-4c21-b04f-3a55789ce7dd#post-0143fc4e-1559-44c0-a7be-26be8f6701e8\">spending on R&amp;D</a>. South Korea joined Switzerland, Sweden, the US and the UK in the top five for the first time with four other Asian economies in the top 15: Singapore (eighth), China (12th), Japan (13th) and Hong Kong (14th).</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p>The lack of lorry drivers is already set to disrupt deliveries for Christmas but new EU labour rules for <strong>commercial transport</strong> (which will also apply to the UK) could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c4f9876-1ec5-41e1-b774-4abd2b58dde9\">deepen the crisis</a> further next year. In the meantime, economists say the <strong>end of furlough</strong> in the UK next week will not help solve the country's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2418208c-b2b6-4fbc-ae50-5eda2656c68e\">labour shortages</a>. </p> <p>A wave of upcoming <strong>stock market debuts</strong> will test whether <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36111815-74a5-40ca-9348-e5e9391c0a1b\">investor appetite for new technologies</a> can outweigh recent worries about the strength of economic recovery. Almost 300 companies have completed an IPO in the US this year, with the total amount of money raised already 40 per cent higher than in the whole of 2020. </p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p>A survey of senior UK executives shared with the FT shows 70 per cent worry about the legal <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31eb8389-6e2a-4de1-a621-fd8d93bc1180\">risks of discrimination</a> on the basis of <strong>vaccination status</strong>. “Employers are in a really delicate balance between respecting everyone's right to choose whether they get the vaccine or not, and keeping the entire workforce safe,” said one legal expert.</p> <p>Could <strong>labour shortages</strong> be cured by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34b831a5-f6d9-4438-924d-b2999a714663\">replacing workers with robots</a>? The pandemic-driven rise in online shopping has accelerated automation, with warehouses globally expected to invest $36bn this year, up 20 per cent on 2020. Amazon (unsurprisingly) leads the way: one estimate puts the company's direct labour cost savings at $3bn-$4bn a year.</p> <p><em>Get the latest worldwide picture with our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker/\"><em>vaccine tracker</em></a></p> <h1>And finally . . .</h1> <p>What better way could there be to take in the views of one of the greatest cities in the world than from the terrace of a historic riverside pub?
