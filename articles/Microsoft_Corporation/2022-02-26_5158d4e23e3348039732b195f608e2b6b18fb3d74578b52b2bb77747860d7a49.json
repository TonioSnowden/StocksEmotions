  "text": "<p>Jeff Hyland's career in real estate got off to a leisurely start. Raised in Los Angeles and enchanted by movie-star mansions, he wanted to be an architect but wasn't good at math.</p><p>For five years after college, he devoted himself mostly to surfing. Then he obtained a real-estate license and proved extraordinarily successful at selling high-end homes. In 1993, he joined Rick Hilton to found a Beverly Hills brokerage, Hilton &amp; Hyland.</p><p>Clients liked his encyclopedic knowledge of grand estates and his stories about dysfunctional Hollywood couples or reclusive billionaires who had lived in them.</p><p>In 2019, Mr. Hyland represented a buyer from Saudi Arabia in a roughly $120 million deal for The Manor, a Holmby Hills estate built by the television producer Aaron Spelling. The same year, he was involved in the $150 million sale of the Bel-Air house used as the Clampett residence in \"The Beverly Hillbillies.\"</p><p>He was especially fond of a Beverly Hills property known as Enchanted Hill. Mr. Hyland arranged a sale of the property in the late 1990s to Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen for $20 million. Mr. Hyland's final major transaction was the recent resale of the property to Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, for $65 million.</p><p>Mr. Hyland died Feb. 16. He was 74 and had been under treatment for sarcoma.</p>",
