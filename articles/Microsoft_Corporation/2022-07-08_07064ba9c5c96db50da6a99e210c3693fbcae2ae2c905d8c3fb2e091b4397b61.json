  "title": "Where Employers Added Jobs in June; Hiring among white-collar workers was robust, other services more tepid",
  "text": "<p>Such white-collar employers had 880,000 more jobs on their payrolls in June than in February 2020, before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the U.S. economy, despite a series of recent high-profile layoffs at companies such as Redfin Corp. and Robinhood Markets Inc.</p><p>White-collar employers hired briskly in June although they posted significantly fewer job openings during May, according to a separate Labor Department report released this week. Professional and business services openings saw the biggest decline of any industry in May with postings dropping by 325,000, the report said.</p><p>Employers in leisure and hospitality, healthcare and retail are also adding jobs at a steady clip, but still had fewer last month than before the pandemic.</p><p>Government employers were the only category to report a decline in payrolls, with a seasonally adjusted loss of 9,000 jobs in June.</p><p>Employers are still struggling to hire in industries where the numbers of job openings far exceed the number of workers actively seeking jobsâ€”a so-called tight labor market.</p><p>The staffing challenges in leisure and hospitality have been particularly noticeable during the early summer months, as pools, restaurants, and other seasonal employers struggled with staffing issues.</p><p>Here's a look at the June job gains in several industries, according to the Labor Department's report:</p><p>Technology</p><p>Despite reports of growing layoffs at some high-profile employers such as Netflix Inc., the tech industry as a whole didn't shed workers in June. Information jobs were up by 25,000 last month, while computer systems design and related services were up by 10,000.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How are employers in your industry working to attract and maintain talent? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Still, fears of recession, rising interest rates and falling stock prices have prompted many tech companies to adjust their staffing plans. Microsoft Corp. said in May that it would be slowing its hiring pace for its software group that develops Windows, Office and Teams applications. Other top tech players, including Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., Twitter Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., also have said that they would be scaling back or freezing hiring plans.</p><p>Healthcare</p><p>Healthcare employers added 57,000 jobs last month but still had 176,000 fewer on their payrolls than in February 2020, or 1.1%. That shortfall remains particularly acute in nursing care facilities, where the job count is down 14.4% from its prepandemic level, though it has been growing steadily since January.</p><p>Retail, Transportation and Warehousing</p><p>Retailers added 15,400 jobs in June after seeing a decline of 43,700 in May. Nonstore retailers, often a proxy for online sellers, have boosted their job numbers by nearly 12% since before the pandemic.</p><p>Employers in warehousing and storage added 18,000 jobs last month, a sign of continued demand for their services. The job count in the overall category of transportation and warehousing is 759,000 above its February 2020 level, in part owing to the shift to e-commerce during the pandemic.</p><p>Manufacturing</p><p>After notching consistent gains for over a year, including 29,000 jobs in June, manufacturers' payrolls are back to their prepandemic level and have grown by 4.1% over the past year. Labor shortages in the sector appear to be abating, as the number of manufacturing job postings fell in May along with manufacturing output.</p><p>Write to Gabriel T.
