  "text": "<p>\"It will fundamentally change the way people interact with each other,\" he said. \"Everything you can do in the digital and virtual worlds . . . you will be able to do inside of gaming.\"</p><p>The metaverse -- a concept rooted in science-fiction novels like \"Snow Crash\" and \"Ready Player One\" -- refers to an extensive online world that is tied to several tech platforms, not just one. People will be able to hang out in immersive, shared digital spaces using avatars that allow them to virtually attend concerts or try on clothes in stores, just like they would do offline in the real world.</p><p>Major tech companies including Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp., and others have spoken publicly about their ideas for the metaverse. Many of them also have growing gaming operations.</p><p>Mr. Wolf said companies would likely need to make additional moves to round out their gaming content on their path to the metaverse. \"We expect the technology giants are going to pursue acquisitions of the top gaming companies,\" he said.</p><p>Facebook in 2019 agreed to acquire PlayGiga, a company in Madrid that specializes in cloud-based gaming. Microsoft was previously in talks to buy chat startup Discord Inc., popular with gamers, before the discussion was halted. The software giant has done several gaming deals, closing its $7.5 billion purchase of videogame company ZeniMax Media Inc. this year.</p><p>Mr. Wolf predicts a competitive future of metaverses. \"There's not going to be one big metaverse or one big platform,\" he said. \"The metaverse is going to be for everyone.\"</p><p>Other forecasts from Mr. Wolf's presentation:</p><p>-- Time spent watching digital videos will increase over the next four years and surpass time spent watching television by 2025.</p><p>-- The shift to e-commerce will accelerate as more car buying moves online.</p><p>-- Audio will be one of the fastest-growing media formats with users estimated to spend nearly three hours a day listening to either podcasts or radio by 2025, up from 2 1/2 hours in 2018.</p><p>-- The global audience for esports is expected to surpass 700 million viewers by 2025. The projected viewers for 2021 is 557 million.</p>",
