  "text": "<p>Li nguist and lexicographer Ben Zimmer analyzes the origins of words in the news. Read previous columns here.</p><p>Just over 50 years ago, Atari, then an enterprising Silicon Valley startup, released an electronic game with a funny name: Pong. In its original incarnation, Pong was an arcade game in which two players control lines on a screen simulating ping-pong paddles, batting back and forth a blip of light representing a ball.</p><p>From that modest beginning, on Nov. 29, 1972, a multibillion-dollar industry was born. Pong is now recognized as the first commercially successful videogame. But when Pong first hit the market, there was no set name for what to call such diversions. The now-accepted term \"videogame\" (with or without a space in the middle) came of age with the games themselves.</p><p>In 1971, the precursor to Atari, Syzygy Engineering, sold a game to arcades called Computer Space, in which a player controls a rocket shooting at flying saucers. That game was inspired by one called \"Spacewar!\" that MIT unveiled in 1962 to show off the capabilities of its state-of-the-art PDP-1 minicomputer.</p><p>When Computer Space failed commercially, its creators, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, rebranded Syzygy as Atari and set about developing new games. Mr. Bushnell had the designer Allan Alcorn create Pong as a training exercise, but the table-tennis-style game proved wildly successful in arcades across the country.</p><p>Pong and various copycats started attracting national attention in 1973, but no one quite knew what to call them. Atari's flyers for Pong calledit a \"two-player video skill game.\" Media accounts would often referto \"electronic pinball machines\" to draw a parallel to the electromechanical pinball games that had ruled arcades up to that point.</p><p>The first known use of \"videogame\" to refer to these arcade attractions, as documented by the Oxford English Dictionary, appeared in the Sept. 25, 1973 issue of the Daily Cougar, the student newspaper of the University of Houston. An article profileda local arcade denizen, Alan Mosshart, nicknamed \"Captain Pinball,\" who attended nearby Sam Houston State University. As the article stated, \"Mosshart finds himself rather intrigued by the newer games as well, such as air hockey and foosball and the video games such as 'Pong.'\"</p><p>The phrase \"video game\" had other uses in the pre-Pong era. When sports like baseball and football began broadcasting on television, the televised matchups were sometimes called \"video games\" in newspaper accounts. One 1948 article in the Cincinnati Enquirer reportedthat Horace Stoneham, president of baseball's New York Giants, was in favor of a \"ban of night video games.\" At the time, there was a concern that people would stop going to baseball games if they could just watch them on television.</p><p>The earliest TV game shows were also sometimes called \"video games.\" For instance, a 1949 headline in the Chicago Tribune announced, \"Cartune-O, New Video Game, on WGN-TV Tonight.\" (A musical quiz show, Cartune-O had previously run on the WGN radio station.)</p><p>The electronic type of amusement that Pong pioneered was the one to fix the expression \"videogame\" in popular parlance. Atari would go on to introduce its Video Computer System (later known as the Atari 2600), which brought games including Space Invaders and Pac-Man into people's homes by means of a console hooked up to a television. Soon, new lexical forms spawned, such as \"videogaming\" and \"videogamer\"—or \"gaming\" and \"gamer\" for short.</p><p>New generations of gamers have played on increasingly sophisticated consoles—such as current market leaders Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo Switch—with gaming on PCs, mobile devices and virtual-reality gear surging in popularity as well. While the term \"videogame\" may no longer conjure up the old Pong machines of the '70s, their blips and bloops still resonate through our linguistic arcade.</p><p>'Videogame': The Electronic Pinball Machine Comes of Age</p>",
