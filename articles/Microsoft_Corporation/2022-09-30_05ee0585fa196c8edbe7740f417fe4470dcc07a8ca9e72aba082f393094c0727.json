  "title": "MANSION  ---  Gilded-Age Living  In Washington, D.C.  ---  This circa-1905 Georgian Revival housed a progressive  foundation. Now it's listed as a single-family home.  ----  By Candace Taylor",
  "text": "<p>   In 2016, Amazon's Jeff Bezos paid $23 million for two side-by-side historic mansions in Washington, D.C. The early-1900s houses had been a museum, but Mr. Bezos converted them into a massive home, where he has since thrown glittering parties attended by the likes of Bill Gates and Ivanka Trump. </p><p>   Now another one of the city's grand historic mansions is hoping to follow suit. </p><p>   Jewett House, a circa-1905 Georgian Revival mansion that has been used for decades as the headquarters of the progressive Bauman Foundation, is listing for $14.5 million. Spanning about 16,500 square feet, the property is the most expensive home on the market in the city, according to listing agent Michael Rankin of TTR Sotheby's International Realty. And while the vast majority of large-scale Gilded Age mansions in D.C. -- and across the country -- are now used as commercial or institutional space, Jewett House is being marketed as a single-family home. </p><p>   \"This house would be a perfect one for Bezos,\" said John Landrum Bryant, vice president of the Bauman Foundation. Or, since Mr. Bezos already owns in D.C., an ideal buyer would be the mogul's ex-wife, philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, he said. </p><p>   Mr. Bryant knows a thing or two about the housing preferences of the elite. Aside from being married to real-estate heiress Patricia Bauman, whose father, Lionel Bauman, launched the foundation, he carries the title of prince of Monteagudo, a town in Spain, and goes by Prince John. </p><p>   The free-standing home on the border of the Dupont Circle and Kalorama neighborhoods was built for Major R. Dickinson Jewett, with an annex added years later, Prince John said. The foundation had been based in the brick and limestone building since the early 1990s, he said, leasing office space at below-market rates to other nonprofit organizations. </p><p>   When Jewett House was built, the neighborhood was far different than it is today, said Stephen Hansen, a historian and author of \"A History of Dupont Circle: Center of High Society in the Capital.\" With the advent of the Gilded Age around the 1880s, wealthy newcomers started building lavish mansions in the Dupont Circle area as a way of showing off their riches, Mr. Hansen said. At the time, \"Dupont was basically the center of high society in Washington,\" he said, with residents including inventor Alexander Graham Bell and Marshall Field &amp; Company co-founder Levi Leiter. The owners of these grand homes came for the social season -- which started when Congress reconvened in November and lasted until just before Easter. \"In Dupont Circle in the season, it was just one big party,\" Mr. Hansen said. </p><p>   The early 1900s, when Jewett House was built, were the twilight of the Gilded Age, he said, which could explain the home's relatively restrained Georgian style and its size. At 16,500 square feet, it is huge by contemporary standards, but somewhat diminutive compared with many nearby homes, Mr. Hansen said. </p><p>   Designed by architects Marsh &amp; Peter, the home has three stories, 14 dormer windows, a clay tile roof and detailed chimneys, Mr. Rankin said. A 1906 article in the Washington Times put the cost of building the home at over $70,000, or roughly $2.35 million in today's dollars. </p><p>   Major Jewett was a prominent lawyer who died in 1917, according to the Jewett Family of America, a genealogical group. He served in the National Guard and practiced law in New York City and D.C. </p><p>   Major Jewett and his wife, Elise Jewett, had a large family and owned multiple properties in D.C. and in Upper Nyack, N.Y., according to court documents filed in connection with the settlement of Mrs. Jewett's estate. </p><p>   As the fortunes of the Gilded Age were decimated by income taxes in the early 20th century, the mansions of Dupont Circle were sold, Mr. Hansen said. The area became a historic district in 1976. </p><p>   Jewett House was sold after Mrs. Jewett died in 1946. </p><p>   Then in 1955, the Boy Scouts of America purchased the building with help from the late socialite and heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, according to Jason Speck, head of archives and special collections at Hillwood, a former home of Ms. Post's that is now a museum. Ms. Post was a friend of Mortimer Schiff, a major figure in early Boy Scouts history, and donated land and money to the organization throughout her life. She gave $50,000 toward the house, Mr. Speck said. It is not clear what they paid in total. </p><p>   The Boy Scouts sold the building in 1974, according to property records, and the Bauman Foundation bought it for $2.1 million in 1993, records show. </p><p>   Besides his role in the foundation, Prince John, 84, is a jewelry designer by trade; Ms. Bauman, 80, is the foundation's president and co-director. For years the couple lived in a large home within walking distance of Jewett House. </p><p>   Jewett House was in disrepair when they bought it, Prince John said, but retained details such as an 8-foot-wide curving staircase and mahogany pocket doors in the dining room. The foundation spent about $2 million renovating and restoring the building, said Prince John. The house had nine or 10 bedrooms, he estimated, but it is now configured with 38 offices and five conference rooms. There are 10 bathrooms, five kitchenettes and an elevator. </p><p>   Despite some changes to its original layout, the building still feels like a house, said Mr. Rankin. The foyer, dining room and drawing room are intact, and while some of the bedrooms have been divided for use as offices, he said, \"you could easily see them being bedrooms.\" Mr. Rankin estimated that it would cost about $500,000 to return the building to residential use. </p><p>   The Bauman Foundation is selling because \"it was time to downsize,\" Prince John said. The couple have sold their home in D.C. and relocated to New York, where they are operating the foundation from their apartment. </p><p>   It is extremely rare for historic homes of this size to come on the market in D.C., Mr. Rankin said. In 2007, an 1810 Federal-style mansion in Georgetown sold for $23.96 million, according to property records. Another mansion, Evermay, built around 1800, was purchased for $22 million in 2011 by biotech executives Sachiko Kuno and Ryuji Ueno, who use it to house their nonprofit organization, S&amp;R Evermay. </p><p></p>",
