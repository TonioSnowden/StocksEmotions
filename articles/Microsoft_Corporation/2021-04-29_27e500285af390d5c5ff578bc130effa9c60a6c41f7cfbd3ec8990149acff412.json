  "title": "Apple Results Signal Sales Will Extend Streak --- Demand for iPhone 12 helps tech giant to more than double its profit for the quarter",
  "text": "<p>Apple's fiscal second-quarter results set new highs in what could likely be a record-setting year for profit and revenue. Analysts predict full-year profit will exceed $70 billion, nearly a third more than last year.</p><p>Apple shares soared 4% in after-hours trading in New York. The Cupertino, Calif., company said profit more than doubled to $23.6 billion as revenue rose 54% to $89.6 billion. Apple announced a 7% increase to its cash dividend to 22 cents a share and that the board authorized an increase of $90 billion to its existing share-repurchase program.</p><p>\"We feel very good, given the results we've had in the first half of our fiscal year,\" Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said in an interview. \"And clearly as economies start to reopen, particularly those economies where there are enough vaccines, obviously we think that should be a positive.\"</p><p>While work-from-home trends helped Apple's performance, Mr. Maestri said the company might see continued benefits from a hybrid work model. A return to more normal conditions could boost other business lines, such as from an increase in the purchase of AppleCare, an extended warranty service, which were negatively affected during the pandemic.</p><p>\"It was obviously more difficult for us to sell iPhones and watches -- that typically require a lot of interactions of our customers,\" he said.</p><p>After a year of hype about the potential for the iPhone 12 and the rapid rise in its shares, Apple is one of a number of companies investors are closely watching for signs about whether the pandemic-induced success can continue.</p><p>Investors were looking for signs that growth will continue, even as the tech sector struggles with a chip shortage and other uncertainties tied to the pandemic.</p><p>\"The market always looks six months ahead,\" said Dan Morgan, a senior portfolio manager who focuses on technology at Synovus Trust Co., which counts Apple among its largest holdings.</p><p>Apple was able to avoid a microprocessor shortage in the March period. But the CFO cautioned, during a conference call, that a shortage of chips would contribute to a greater-than-normal decline in revenue in the current quarter. Supply constraints will primarily affect Macs and iPads.</p><p>Apple still expects \"strong double digit\" revenue growth from a year ago, he said. It stopped providing detailed guidance about coming quarters last year, as the pandemic upended daily life and initially sent markets falling amid fears of a global recession.</p><p>Apple shares were up 1.3% this year through Tuesday, compared with a roughly 12% gain for the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Apple and other tech giants benefited as students and workers stuck at home turned to their products in record numbers, pushing share prices to new heights. Apple's stock almost doubled last year. Its current valuation, as a measure of its price-to-earnings ratio, is the highest since December 2007, according to FactSet.</p><p>Google parent Alphabet Inc. beat sales records in the latest quarter because of an increase in digital-ad spending, and Microsoft Corp. saw its quarterly sales increase 19%.</p><p>As the biggest tech companies continue to post record results, they remain in the crosshairs of regulators. Apple's strength in the market is being questioned by smaller tech companies.</p><p>Apple rolled out this week software changes to iPhones and iPads to make it harder for apps to track users across the internet, a measure touted by Chief Executive Tim Cook as a consumer safeguard. Facebook Inc. and others have questioned Apple's motives.</p><p>Apple is on the eve of going to trial in federal court to defend itself against claims by the maker of the videogame \"Fortnite\" that the iPhone company is engaged in anticompetitive behavior in its App Store. Apple has denied wrongdoing.Observers are watching for European regulators to reveal results soon of their investigations into claims of Apple's monopoly behavior. Apple has said the complaints are baseless and defended its role in promoting businesses on its App Store.</p><p>Much of the growth last year was fueled in unexpected places. Apple saw record demand for Mac computers and an 11% rise in iPad sales. That growth continued in the March period. On Wednesday, Apple said Mac sales rose 70% to $9.1 billion and iPads increased 79% to $7.8 billion. That beat analyst expectations for increases of 27% and 29%, respectively.</p><p>The real engine of 2021 is the latest iPhone: Overall iPhone revenue rose 65% to $47.9 billion. Analysts had expected a 42% rise. Higher-end versions of the iPhone 12 appear to be boosting that figure. The average retail price in the U.S. during the past three months rose $52 to $847 from a year earlier, according to data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners LLC, which surveys buyers. The most expensive version, the iPhone 12 Pro Max with a 6.7 inch display that starts at $1,099, saw its share grow to 20% of sales from 13% a year earlier, the survey found.</p>",
