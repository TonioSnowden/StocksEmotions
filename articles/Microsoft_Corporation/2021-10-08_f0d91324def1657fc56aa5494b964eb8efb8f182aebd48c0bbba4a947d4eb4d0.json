  "text": "<p>QHP's new private-equity fund, which is called NovaQuest Private Equity Fund II LP, is targeting $425 million, the people said. If the firm reaches its goal, the new fund would be more than 50% larger than its predecessor, NovaQuest Private Equity Fund I LP, which wrapped up with $275 million in 2019.</p><p>QHP plans to cap the latest fund at $500 million, the people said. Placement agent Eaton Partners is marketing the fund, a second regulatory filing indicates. New Mexico Educational Retirement Board committed $60 million to the new private-equity fund, pension documents show.</p><p>The QHP team spun out to better align fund economics with the team that is making the investment decisions for the private-equity fund, the people said.</p><p>Sir Dennis Gillings, who is a principal owner of NovaQuest, will be a majority shareholder in the new private-equity firm, the regulatory filing said. Sir Gillings is the founder and former chairman of clinical research company Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc. Quintiles merged with information and technology services company IMS Health Holdings Inc. in 2016 and rebranded as IQVIA Inc. the following year.</p><p>NovaQuest will provide QHP with some services, including accounting, finance, operations, information technology, legal and compliance until the end of 2021; the two firms currently share a chief compliance officer, the regulatory filing said.</p><p>The private-equity strategy at NovaQuest was founded by Jeff Edwards, who joined the firm in 2015, according to his LinkedIn page. Mr. Edwards previously co-managed the direct private-equity investment program at pension plan Teacher Retirement System of Texas, according to NovaQuest's website.</p><p>Michael Sorensen, a partner in the NovaQuest private-equity group, joined the firm in 2016. Previously, Mr. Sorensen worked at BlackRock Private Equity and at the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, his profile on LinkedIn shows. Messrs. Edwards and Sorensen co-lead the private-equity strategy, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The private-equity team has made at least seven investments, NovaQuest's website shows. In February, the firm backed a growth investment in Durham, N.C.-based Pro-ficiency LLC, a provider of tech-enabled training and compliance services for clinical trial investigators and staff. Before that, it acquired Clearwater, Fla.-based CoreRx Inc., a contract development and manufacturing organization that provides services to pharmaceutical and biotech clients.</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com</p><p>NovaQuest Capital's Private-Equity Spinoff Pitches New Fund</p>",
