  "text": "<p>If every iCloud has a silver lining, then from every pandemic bursts an online business opportunity. In much of Africa, that opportunity has been fintech. </p> <p>The need for virtual banking and online services during Covid-19, combined with faster connectivity and some early success stories, has attracted rising amounts of international capital to African start-ups. While these investments remain relatively small — <a href=\"https://partechpartners.com/2020-africa-tech-venture-capital-report/\">a total of $1.4bn</a> in 2020 — things have reached a tipping point. </p> <p>This month <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/tiger-global-leads-42m-series-b-in-nigerian-credit-led-neobank-fairmoney/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJmryPjqOXkUIwn7vQVsx-xJ-4VaP55wE-o7aNNHbDMWxPkwaBdOKbyG-_YQXkPT9px7fIDJCBih6Vvwgcj_fsk6bK0FmImIzwA_RcMdfsm4lRrK-BYWzYIE_ZRs5ZghD-9XBYzYtQXQEPoGfFDbB-vh43rppdrSXY0cKIYwOhun\">FairMoney</a>, a Nigerian fintech, raised $42m in a funding round led by Tiger Global Management, a New York hedge fund. FairMoney has received the go-ahead from Nigeria's central bank to take deposits. Last year it disbursed small loans averaging $65 and worth a total $93m to roughly 1.3m people and microenterprises.</p> <p>There are now four African start-ups, loosely defined, that have reached unicorn status with a valuation above $1bn. One is Fawry, an Egyptian payments platform that went public in 2019. The others are Flutterwave, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b5024e0-5d1d-11e9-9dde-7aedca0a081a\">Jumia</a> and Interswitch, which all have operations in Nigeria. Jumia, an online retailer, is listed in New York.</p> <p>Interswitch, a digital payments platform, gained its unicorn spurs when Visa bought a 20 per cent stake in it for $200m in 2019. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/09/african-payments-company-flutterwave-raises-170m-now-valued-at-over-1b/\">Flutterwave</a>, which has offices in Lagos and San Francisco, hit the $1bn mark in March when it raised $170m from US investors. </p> <p>Several factors explain this spurt of activity. Africa is getting more connected. Google and Facebook are building undersea cables that will link more than 20 countries with Europe and the Middle East. Liquid Intelligent Technologies, part of Zimbabwean entrepreneur Strive Masiyiwa's Econet Global, is linking east to west Africa with fibre optic cable. Gaps will be plugged by low-orbiting satellites from the likes of Elon Musk's Starlink. Smartphone penetration is rising fast. </p> <p>Africa, a region long defined by fragmentation, is ripe for innovation in finance, logistics, health and retail, which will slice the costs of doing business. With a median age of 19, there is a raw entrepreneurial energy in cities such as Cairo, Johannesburg, Lagos and Nairobi.</p> <p>Young entrepreneurs are stepping into a void left by unimaginative public policies and shoddy infrastructure. Typical is <a href=\"https://www.builtinafrica.io/videos/samrawit-fikru\">Samrawit Fikru</a>, an Ethiopian woman who founded Ride, a taxi-hailing app. Young Africans have tapped into international networks. FairMoney was co-founded by Laurin Nabuko Hainy, a German-Nigerian man. It has launched a business in India, part of a trend of African start-ups taking on other emerging economies.</p> <p>South Africa's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dcf8d236-374a-4ca5-9470-4c9573044501\">TymeBank</a> raised $110m to expand into the Philippines. FlexClub, a South African company that allows Uber drivers to hire cars on subscription, operates in Mexico. </p> <p>Still, there are missing elements. Authorities and central banks have been wary of business propositions they don't understand. Some caution is warranted — for example, in the regulation of payday loans. But regulators need to get to grips with new technologies so they can assist innovation, even if that means toppling vested interests. </p> <p>There is also a shortage of African corporate venture capital beyond the early stages. African start-ups attract US and, increasingly, Chinese investment. But most established African business leaders prefer traditional sectors such as food-processing, import monopolies, mining and hydrocarbons.</p> <p>International backing for African start-ups is to be celebrated. But where is Aliko Dangote's corporate venture capital fund, something Nigeria's salt-to-cement billionaire could fund out of petty cash? Makhtar Diop, managing director of the International Finance Corporation, predicts that the next Bill Gates will be African. Some big investors in the continent's next Microsoft should surely be African, too.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:david.pilling@ft.com\"><em>david.pilling@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this column</strong>:<br><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/662d5aef-0c3b-44e5-9c3d-7fac7e3e4d4a\"><em>Keep a few seats for locals in Africa's investor rush</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/662d5aef-0c3b-44e5-9c3d-7fac7e3e4d4a\"><em>From Grace Gardner, Manchester, UK</em></a>&#xa0;</p><p>Source: David Pilling 2021 'African start-ups attract international investors — but need local ones too' FT.com 15 July.
