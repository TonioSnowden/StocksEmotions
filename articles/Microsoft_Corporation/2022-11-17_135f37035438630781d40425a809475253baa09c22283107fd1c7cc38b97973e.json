  "title": "Three Executives in India Leave  Facebook Parent Meta Platforms  ----  By Newley Purnell",
  "text": "<p>   Three of Meta Platforms Inc.'s top executives in India have departed the company in recent weeks, with the Facebook parent changing the country's reporting structure amid its first global restructuring, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The India head of Meta's WhatsApp messaging service, Abhijit Bose, and Meta's India public policy director, Rajiv Aggarwal, have resigned, a Meta spokeswoman said Wednesday. Their exits follow the departure announced earlier this month of Meta's India head, Ajit Mohan. </p><p>   The departures of Messrs. Bose and Aggarwal are unrelated to layoffs of more than 11,000 workers that Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg announced last week, the spokeswoman said. </p><p>   The company's India head for years reported directly to the core leadership team of Mr. Zuckerberg in Menlo Park, Calif., but will now report to Meta's top Asia-Pacific executive in Singapore, the people said. </p><p>   Meta's spokeswoman declined to comment on the structural changes. </p><p>   Meta's services in India, its biggest market by users, have grown rapidly in recent years. Hundreds of millions of people have gotten online for the first time, and Meta has invested billions of dollars in the country. Its challenges, including government regulation and criticism by human-rights groups over its policing of hate speech, have grown. </p><p>   Mr. Mohan, who had been India head since 2019, said in a post on LinkedIn that he had resigned from Meta to take on a role leading the Asia-Pacific region for Snapchat parent Snap Inc. A Meta representative said Mr. Mohan's move was unrelated to Meta's layoffs, and that Manish Chopra, Meta's director of partnerships in India, is now Meta India's interim head. </p><p>   Messrs. Bose and Aggarwal couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Bose on LinkedIn said he planned to take a break before beginning a new entrepreneurial venture. </p><p>   Will Cathcart, head of WhatsApp, thanked Mr. Bose for his \"tremendous contributions\" to the service. Mr. Chopra said in a statement that Mr. Aggarwal had played an important role in the company. </p><p></p>",
