  "title": "Top California Agency Attorneys Leave Roles Amid Activision Blizzard Lawsuit; One was fired by Gov. Gavin Newsom, another resigned in response to the firing, according to a lawyer representing the two attorneys",
  "text": "<p>The department's assistant chief counsel, Melanie Proctor, resigned in protest of Ms. Wipper's firing, the statement from Ms. Ronickher, who is also her lawyer, said. Ms. Proctor's resignation was effective Wednesday.</p><p>Bloomberg News earlier reported that Ms. Proctor had accused Mr. Newsom's office of meddling in the Activision case, citing an email Ms. Proctor had sent to staff.</p><p>\"Claims of interference by our office are categorically false,\" said Erin Mellon, a spokeswoman for Mr. Newsom, in an email.</p><p>Activision didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>DFEH Director Kevin Kish said in a statement Wednesday that his department \"has litigated groundbreaking cases that are a model of effective government enforcement of civil rights.\"</p><p>\"We continue to do so with the full support of the administration,\" he said.</p><p>The day Ms. Wipper was told she was being terminated was the same day a California judge approved an $18 million settlement between Activision and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p><p>The EEOC had been investigating the company for sexual-harassment and retaliation allegations. The company had agreed last year to settle with the agency, but the two entities became locked in a monthslong legal battle with the DFEH. That agency said its lawsuit against Activision could be ruined by the EEOC case.</p><p>The two attorneys' exits come amid a lawsuit the agency filed last summer against Activision that alleged female employees got fewer opportunities to advance and were paid less than their male counterparts. The lawsuit also alleged that the company ignored female employees' complaints of discrimination, harassment and retaliation.</p><p>Activision has said the lawsuit includes distorted and, in many cases, false descriptions of its past, and that it strives to pay all employees fairly.</p><p>Federal and state regulators have since widened their investigations into Activision's leadership.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported in November that Activision Chief Executive Bobby Kotick knew about sexual-misconduct allegations at the company for years, and didn't inform the board of directors. A company spokeswoman had told the Journal in a written statement that its CEO \"would not have been informed of every report of misconduct at every Activision Blizzard company, nor would he reasonably be expected to have been updated on all personnel issues.\"</p><p>An Activision spokeswoman has called the Journal's reporting misleading. Mr. Kotick said in an interview last year that he was transparent with his board of directors.</p><p>Tech giant Microsoft Corp. agreed earlier this year to buy Activision in an all-cash deal valued at about $75 billion. That deal hasn't yet closed.</p><p>Activision, based in Santa Monica, Calif., is known for games including \"World of Warcraft,\" \"Call of Duty\" and \"Candy Crush.\"</p><p>â€”Sarah E.
