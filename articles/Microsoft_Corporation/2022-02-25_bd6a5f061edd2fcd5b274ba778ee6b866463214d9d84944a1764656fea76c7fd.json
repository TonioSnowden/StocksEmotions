  "title": "Playtika Shares Rise More Than 10% After Company Says It's Exploring Strategic Options, Including a Sale; The mobile videogame developer's shares had fallen sharply from last year's high to below their IPO price",
  "text": "<p>The stock traded as high as $34.28 a share in February 2021, but was down nearly 44% over the past year, closing at $18.01 on Thursday.</p><p>\"The goal of the strategic evaluation process we are announcing today is to ensure we are taking every step possible to maximize value for our stockholders,\" Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Antokol said in prepared remarks.</p><p>Playtika said the Raine Group is acting as its financial adviser with the strategic review process. It has also retained Latham &amp; Watkins LLP as its legal counsel. Playtika said the review could include a sale or other possible transactions.</p><p>The company also reported Thursday that its fourth-quarter revenue rose to $649 million from $573.5 million in the year-ago period. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting $636.9 million.</p><p>Last month Playtika's largest shareholder, Playtika Holding UK II, said it wanted to sell 15% to 25% of the outstanding stock in the company. Playtika Holding UK II is controlled by the affiliates of Yuzhu Shi, the founder of Chinese videogame developer Giant Interactive Group, which was part of a consortium that acquired Playtika in 2016 for $4.4 billion in cash.</p><p>\"A less disruptive way to sell those shares would be to sell to a strategic investor or sell the company outright,\" said MKM Partners analyst Eric Handler. Compared with other recent deals for mobile-game companies, \"Playtika is trading at a severe discount.\"</p><p>There has been a lot of recent deal activity in the videogame industry. Last month Microsoft Corp. said it reached an agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard Inc. for $75 billion a week after Take-Two Interactive Software Corp. announced plans to buy Zynga Inc. for $11 billion. Also last month, Sony Group Corp.'s videogame unit said it is buying Bungie Inc., the studio that created the Halo and Destiny franchises, in a deal valued at $3.6 billion.</p><p>Those moves come after mergers-and-acquisitions deals within the game industry at large nearly tripled to $26.2 billion last year from $8.9 billion in 2020, according to data from PitchBook. Last year's deals included Take-Two's purchase of mobile-game studio Nordeus and Electronic Arts Inc.'s purchases of Codemasters and Glu Mobile.</p><p>Mobile is the largest segment of the more than $180 billion global game industry overall, accounting for more consumer spending than on console and computer games combined in 2021, data from analytics firm Newzoo BV show. Playtika's mobile games gained about 141.3 million new installs across the App Store and Google Play in 2021, up approximately 36% from 103.7 million installs in 2020, estimates Sensor Tower Inc.</p><p>Still, attracting a buyer could be challenging for Playtika, as it doesn't have a diverse portfolio of games or a record of bringing console games to mobile devices, said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. \"They are possibly looking at going private,\" he said.</p><p>Stephen Nakrosis contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Sarah E.
