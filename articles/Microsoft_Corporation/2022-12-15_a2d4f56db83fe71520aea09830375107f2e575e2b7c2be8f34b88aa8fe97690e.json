  "text": "<p>Ms. Scott and her team have until now researched and chosen donation recipients through a private evaluation process that considered their track records and likelihood of \"sustained positive impact,\" according to details on the new website. Organizations will soon be able to apply for consideration, the website said.</p><p>\"Information from other people—other givers, my team, the non-profit teams I've been giving to—has been enormously helpful to me,\" Ms. Scott wrote in an essay published on the website Wednesday. \"If more information about these gifts can be helpful to anyone, I want to share it.\"</p><p>Ms. Scott is one of the richest women in the world, with a net worth of $21.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. She played an instrumental role in building Amazon.com Inc. with founder Jeff Bezos, her then-husband. She received 4% of the company's shares as part of their divorce settlement.</p><p>Ms. Scott vowed to give away the majority of her wealth in 2019. She signed the Giving Pledge, created by Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chief Executive Warren Buffett to encourage the world's richest people to give more than half of their wealth away to philanthropic groups and causes.</p><p>Since then, organizations including the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America and Planned Parenthood Federation of America have described Ms. Scott's donations as the largest single gifts in their history.</p><p>The website's details about recipients and Ms. Scott's process of choosing and evaluating them offers more transparency about her work and philanthropic targets, said Jeannie Sager, director of the Women's Philanthropy Institute at Indiana University's Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. Ms. Sager said she is also eager to see how the website becomes a resource for other organizations and philanthropists.</p><p>\"One could say that she's an outlier,\" she said of Ms. Scott's philanthropic efforts compared with others'. \"I also think she does continue to want to inspire.\"</p><p>Ms. Scott has published essays on Medium over the years sharing details about her philanthropic endeavors. Those essays now also appear on Yield Giving's website.</p><p>In an essay published Wednesday, Ms. Scott wrote that the goal of the website is to provide a searchable and sortable set of data about the nonprofits she has donated to, as well as details from her about \"what we do, and why.\"</p><p>Ms. Scott said her team's open-call process will focus on \"one or more specific themes, geographies, and types of organizations at a time.\"</p><p>Write to Jennifer Calfas at jennifer.calfas@wsj.com</p><p>MacKenzie Scott Launches Website to Detail Her Philanthropic Efforts</p>",
