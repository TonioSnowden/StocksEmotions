A spokeswoman for Robinhood declined to comment.</p><p>The appointment comes as Cross River Bank, which is backed by some of Silicon Valley's top venture-capital firms, looks to make cryptocurrency a bigger part of its business.</p><p>The community bank, which is based in Fort Lee, N.J., and has two branches, one in nearby Teaneck and another in Brooklyn, N.Y., uses its position as a chartered and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-member bank to help fintech firms do things that are tougher for nonbank firms under U.S. rules. That includes originating loans in any state and moving funds over the banking system's rails on behalf of its partners or customers.</p><p>Cross River Bank, which also offers commercial and personal banking services, has been growing rapidly.
