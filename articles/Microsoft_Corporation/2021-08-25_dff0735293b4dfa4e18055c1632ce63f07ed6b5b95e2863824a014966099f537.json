  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: Goldman Sachs </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eed019a6-903f-4cfc-aaa1-777f00fa148a\">will require</a> proof of vaccination from all staff and clients entering the bank's offices, as vaccine mandates proliferate across the US public and private sectors after the BioNTech/Pfizer Covid-19 jab received full regulatory approval.</p> <p><strong>Another thing to start:</strong> <strong>TPG</strong> has appointed <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> to work on an initial public offering, inching closer to an outcome that the firm contemplated for much of the past decade but delayed while it shifted strategy and recovered from the poor performance of some investments. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/688edf60-c912-443d-b2a3-4cef8a2d778b?edit=true\">More here</a>.</p> <h2>OnlyFans prepares for an NSFW-free future</h2> <p>When <strong>OnlyFans</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/216c8f47-153c-4d0d-8f01-c46abf06b9c0\">announced</a> it was banning sexually explicit content last week, it took a lot of people by surprise.&#xa0;</p> <p>The move appeared to shun adult performers who have helped turn the group into one of the world's fastest-growing social media platforms.&#xa0;</p> <p>A diverse group of creators, including sex workers, celebrities and influencers, have flocked to the site where they can charge fans for customised content.&#xa0;</p> <p>The company hinted that the policy switch was driven by pressure from financial services companies, but went no further than saying that “banks and other financial partners are introducing more controls”.</p> <p>Now, in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b8ce71c-a87a-440e-9f3d-58069ca0480b\">interview</a> with the FT's Patricia Nilsson, OnlyFans founder <strong>Tim Stokely</strong> has revealed that his hand was forced by partner banks.</p> <p>The Essex businessman, who co-founded OnlyFans in 2016 with his father <strong>Guy Stokely</strong>, a former <strong>Barclays</strong> banker, told the FT that the company “had no choice” and blamed “unfair” treatment by banks for forcing him to ban pornography on the platform.&#xa0;</p> <p>Here's the issue: OnlyFans uses banks to pay its content creators but many traditional lenders don't want to be associated with the porn industry. Despite what some DD readers might think, banks have reputations to protect.&#xa0;</p> <p>The younger Stokely singled out <strong>Bank of New York Mellon</strong> for having “flagged and rejected” every wire connected to the company, as well as UK-based<strong> Metro Bank</strong> for closing OnlyFans' corporate account on short notice in 2019.</p> <p>He added that JPMorgan “is particularly aggressive in closing accounts of sex workers”.</p> <p>Stokely shot down reports that the move was driven by a desire to attract investors, saying existing owners wouldn't bring on anyone who was uncomfortable with adult performers. He added that he'd happily welcome porn back if the banking environment changes.</p> <p>That's unlikely to happen anytime soon, though.&#xa0;</p> <p>Even payments groups such as <strong>PayPal</strong> and <strong>Square</strong> prohibit payments for sexual products and services of any kind, including legal ones. Meanwhile, <strong>Mastercard</strong> has announced stricter rules for “speciality merchants”, aka the porn industry.&#xa0;</p> <p>Regardless of who is to blame, the move has sowed doubt over the company's future and caused outrage among the site's users.&#xa0;</p> <p>Though several celebrities have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d4562f8-166f-4a89-a3cb-db97123a6cf0\">joined the platform</a>, including musician <strong>Cardi B </strong>and actress <strong>Bella Thorne</strong>, for many of its 130m users it represents a means of income. They may need to find somewhere else to go.</p> <h2>The Wall Street linchpin charging 25 cents to send an email&#xa0;&#xa0;</h2> <p>Most DD readers have likely never heard of <strong>Broadridge Financial Solutions</strong>. But they've probably heard of you.&#xa0;</p> <p>The proxy services company is a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f912194-cd4e-424a-8d42-da3a98ca3836\">little-known power player</a> in the investment industry.&#xa0;</p> <p>When investors buy shares in a mutual fund or a company through a broker or bank — think <strong>Charles Schwab</strong>, <strong>ETrade</strong>, or JPMorgan — they don't actually own the shares under their own name. They're owned under the respective broker's name.</p> <p>Because funds don't know who their investors are, they enlist proxy service companies like Broadridge to send emails to shareholders. These companies are effectively middlemen, connecting brokers with their customers.&#xa0;</p> <p>Funds are then invoiced for the costs of the mailings, and the costs are passed up to investors in the form of fees.</p> <p>Broadridge, which controls the vast majority of the market, has recently come under fire for the fees it charges brokerages to send emails to shareholders. The company, headquartered in Lake Success, New York, no longer boasts its enormous market share on its website but estimates are in the range of 80 to 90 per cent.</p> <p>Its dominance has led critics, frustrated with the lack of price competition, to accuse it of monopolising the market. Others say that's not possible when there is a limit on how high prices can go — the <strong>New York Stock Exchange</strong> caps fees at 25 cents per mailing.&#xa0;</p> <p>Yet funds who are footing the bill say Broadridge has no incentive to charge any less than the maximum amount allowed, given its dominance.&#xa0;</p> <p>Investors might not notice the fees because they're so small, the funds said. But a few cents charged across millions of investors adds up. Estimates from the <strong>Investment Company Institute</strong>, the industry body for US funds, says Broadridge's excess fees amount to more than $220m per year.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Discord levels up into the mainstream</h2> <p>“I gotta tell ya, I have no idea what this is for,”<strong> Danny DeVito </strong>tells comedian and rapper <strong>Awkwafina</strong> in the opening scene of their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xOkZ0_Rocs\">short film</a> meant to unveil <strong>Discord</strong>, the chat platform popular with video-gamers, to the wider world.</p> <p>The platform has yet to become a household name outside of the niche gaming, retail trading, and crypto enthusiasts that use its platform to swap strategies.</p> <p>However, its chief executive and founder <strong>Jason Citron</strong> plans to change that, he told the FT's Hannah Murphy in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e878e72-38b2-427a-a325-6a419d9f1c88\">interview</a>.</p> <p>After rebuffing a number of suitors, including a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-20/chat-app-discord-is-said-to-end-takeover-talks-with-microsoft?sref=OziMsGoK\">$12bn takeover</a> bid from <strong>Microsoft</strong>, the company is raising a funding round that would value it at $15bn, according to a <a href=\"https://www.newcomer.co/p/sources-discord-raising-at-roughly\">recent report</a> by the Newcomer newsletter and one person familiar with the situation. It's also eyeing a public listing, two people familiar with the situation told the FT.</p> <p>“There's this big trend [of people moving from] broadcast wide-open social media communication services to more small, intimate places,” said Citron. “We're a meaningful part of how that's evolving on the internet.”</p> <p>Discord doesn't appear to lack potential suitors. Both<strong> Amazon </strong>and <strong>Twitter </strong>have also made passes at the company, according to Bloomberg.&#xa0;</p> <p>But rather than becoming a cog in a larger Silicon Valley machine, it may decide it's better off going at it alone.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Yale</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a42e730-0d43-402f-afb8-c11bb30e5838?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">appointed</a> <strong>Matthew Mendelsohn</strong>, who leads the $31bn endowment's venture capital investments, as its chief investment officer. He succeeds<strong> David Swensen</strong>, who died in May after a long battle with cancer.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>FactSet</strong> has appointed<strong> Linda Huber </strong>as its chief financial officer, succeeding<strong> Helen Shan</strong>, who has assumed the role of chief revenue officer. Huber was previously CFO and executive vice-president of <strong>Moody's Corporation</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Dechert </strong>has hired <strong>Hartley West</strong>, a former assistant US attorney for the Northern District of California, and <strong>Rick Horvath</strong>, former counsel at<strong> Paul Hastings</strong>, as partners in its global litigation practice in San Francisco.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Talk isn't cheap </strong>Spotify's $230m acquisition of Gimlet Media — the “HBO of podcasting” — sparked an M&amp;A frenzy for podcast companies. But insiders say that since the 2019 deal, Gimlet has struggled to find its way.
