  "text": "<p>\n  UMANG GUPTA </p><p>\n  1949-2022 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  After earning an M.B.A. at Kent State University and working for International Business Machines Corp., Umang Gupta was tempted to return to his native India and start his own company. He went home for an extended visit in late 1977. Then he was lured back by two things, a girlfriend and a sense that Silicon Valley was his best career bet. </p><p>\n  He married the young woman, Ruth Pike, in 1980 and raised a family with her. He signed on as employee No. 17 at what became the software giant Oracle Corp. He launched his own software company, Gupta Technologies Inc., in 1984. Initially successful, that business floundered in the mid-1990s as Oracle and Microsoft Corp. muscled into its niche. </p><p>\n  \"For the first time in my life I felt like a failure,\" Mr. Gupta wrote later. </p><p>\n  He got another chance in January 1998 when he was named chief executive officer of Keynote Systems Inc. A pioneer in selling software as a subscription service, Keynote gave companies a way to measure the performance of their websites. Mr. Gupta expanded the company and sold it in 2013 to Thoma Bravo LLC for about $395 million. </p><p>\n  In recent years, Mr. Gupta assembled a team to develop a free application called Reading Racer to help children learn to read. </p><p>\n  Mr. Gupta died April 19. He was 72 and had been under treatment for cancer for 2 1/2 years. </p><p></p>",
