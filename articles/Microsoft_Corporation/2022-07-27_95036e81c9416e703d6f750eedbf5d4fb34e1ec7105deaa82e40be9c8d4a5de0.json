  "title": "Switching to sustainable cargo transportation has been a rough road. Here's the way to speed up adoption. Sustainable shipping and commercial trucking buyers' cIubs, essentially business alliances, are among the most powerful forces against climate change and fossil-fuel inertia",
  "text": "<p>Indeed, fossil fuels set such a high bar for energy density, cost and efficiency — the current geopolitically-induced shortage notwithstanding — that market drivers alone cannot dent their dominance. That means in absence of external forces compelling a change to sustainable alternatives, inertia would seem to continue propelling the world down the road to emissions-derived climate calamity.</p><p>For certain, there's been no shortage of consequential sustainable milestones. In just the past month, for example, we've seen: the first commercial plane flight powered solely by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF); the first hydrogen-electric heavy-duty truck, and the first 40-ton electric tractor-trailer with a 300-mile range, double what existing EV semis can travel on a single charge.</p><p>Read: Carbon capture, nuclear and hydrogen feature in most net-zero emissions plans and need greater investment: report</p><p>To be fair, progress is not linear. Game-changing innovations invariably take far longer to change the game than anyone expects. We understood that the transition to battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cells and biofuels would start off slowly and accelerate as we make our way into the 2030s.</p><p>Some of the requisite technologies, materials and processes haven't yet been proven to be viable at scale. Others haven't even been invented. And even where solutions are evident, overcoming the infrastructure hurdles — for example, how to outfit remote locations like Holladay, Tenn., and Winslow, Ariz., with megawatts of power for charging — will take years and mounds of resources. And, frankly, it will take a much larger policy push in the right direction.</p><p>Key market: long-haul trucking</p><p>When folks talk about the heavy lift required to convert the long-haul trucking infrastructure from diesel to sustainable alternatives, they typically point to the cost of replacing diesel tanks and pumps at the nation's 10,000 or so truck stops, which is substantial. But the task is more daunting than that.</p><p>For starters, the network of truck stops is optimized for diesel fleets. Stations are staggered from each other and outfitted with services, like restaurants, showers and mechanics, that best cater to drivers who need to refuel or pull in for a requisite 10-hour stop. Hydrogen- and battery-powered trucks will require new fueling stations with new infrastructure and, given shorter ranges, in new locations. And with multi-hour charging times for battery-propelled rigs, electronic data logging regulations that dictate daily drive-and-rest routines will need to be different than for diesel to be competitive.</p><p>Then there's the impossibly complex issue of how many fuels to offer, and how much of each. These quantities necessarily will change over time as low- and no-emission fuels become more prevalent, which confounds long-term investment. Besides diesel, battery-electric charging and hydrogen, add to the mix bridge fuels — alternatives like renewable natural gas captured from waste — to help cut carbon output while sustainable fuels scale.</p><p>Of course, carriers like AmazonAMZN, FedExFDX and UPSUPS — not to mention truck manufacturers like DaimlerXE:DTG, International Corp. and VolvoSE:VOLV.B — all have the same thorny mix to navigate as they update their fleets.</p><p>Air and Sea: Not yet practical</p><p>Foreboding as the hurdles might seem for sustainable long-haul trucking, they pale in comparison to aviation and container shipping.</p><p>Hydrogen and battery-electric alternatives are developing for local and regional aviation and maritime shipping. But neither sustainable fuel is currently practical for long flights. And they are flat-out impossible for ocean lanes like the 6,500-mile China-to-U.S. route.</p><p>For the foreseeable future, combustible biofuels are the only viable option. Like renewable natural gas and diesel for trucking, biofuels for aviation and container shipping are harvested from sustainable sources like waste and feed stock. They offer similar energy density — and thus, travel range — as fossil fuels, with emissions reductions of 20% to 90%.</p><p>Hopefully, new investments will wrangle emissions as close to zero as possible. In the meantime, the two most immediate hurdles for aviation and shipping are securing reliable biofuel capacity, and governance.</p><p>The lion's share of biofuel capacity is dedicated to trucking. That's in large part because on-road vehicles are responsible for three quarters of greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. It's also because there are government incentives that favor biodiesel over biofuels for other modes of transport.</p><p>Governance — that's the \"G\" in ESG, of course — can be a huge challenge for aviation. The way fuel is produced, purchased, stored and pumped in aviation can make it difficult to validate that an airline's fleet actually burned the SAF it paid for. Without proper credit, airlines may be disinclined to pay a premium for sustainable fuels.</p><p>The problem is compounded for cargo shipping. It's not only difficult to track cleaner fuels into freighters, it's also challenging to determine which vessel actually carried your containers.</p><p>Toward that end, one program, Eco Delivery from MaerskDK:MAERSK.B, one of the world's largest ocean shippers, buys biofuels on behalf of container owners and certifies for them the decrease in carbon emissions. This month, Maersk signed on tech giant LenovoHK:992, which becomes the first tech exporter out of China in the program.</p><p>Besting inertia: Buyers' clubs and other influencers</p><p>Perhaps the greatest hurdle yet to overcome is grounded in science. Not biology, chemistry or engineering, rather physics. Enter: Sir Isaac Newton. Indeed, it is the inertia of the fossil-fuel economy that presents the greatest threat to sustainable transportation.</p><p>What, then, will apply the force that pushes commercial transportation over the hump to sustainability?</p><p>Realistically, it probably won't be the federal government. A tightly divided Congress has gotten in its own way of passing anything of significance. And now that the Supreme Court has restricted the EPA in an energy-sector case, the executive branch will have more trouble independently setting and enforcing its own climate-change and sustainable-energy regulations. Sure, the June SCOTUS ruling restricted EPA power-plant scrutiny to a case-by-case basis, but the decision gives those in the transportation sector a blueprint for clipping the agency's wings.</p><p>State governments — notably California and the Pacific Northwest — continue to pick up the slack in myriad ways and could inspire other state and local action.</p><p>Of course, non-governmental organizations are helping apply pressure to spark new regulations and influence corporate behavior.</p><p>Institutional investors like BlackrockBLK and Vanguard are prioritizing climate-minded companies. As well, dedicated sustainability venture funds — including traditional VCs like the $1 billion Generate Capital fund, as well as corporate investment arms like Microsoft'sMSFT $1 billion Climate Innovation Fund and the $2 billion Amazon Climate Pledge Fund — are helping accelerate new innovations. Several funds, for example, just invested $198 million in a company called Electric Hydrogen, which is working to scale a promising low-cost green hydrogen-producing process.</p><p>Buyers' clubs — that is, industry alliances like the Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels and First Movers Coalition that pool customer influence to lean on commercial transportation companies to provide lower-emissions shipping — are also becoming more prevalent.</p><p>To me, buyers' cIubs are the most powerful arrows in the climate quiver, and one that just might stop the fossil-fuel industry from its power of inertia. Because in business, there's no more disruptive force than the cooperation of its customers demanding something different.</p><p>Mike Feibus is president and principal analyst of FeibusTech, a market research and consulting firm.
