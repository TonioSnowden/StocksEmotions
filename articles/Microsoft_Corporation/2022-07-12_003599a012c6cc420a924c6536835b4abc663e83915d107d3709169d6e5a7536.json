  "text": "<p>Be the first to know about the biggest and best luxury home sales and listings by signing up for our Mansion Deals email alert.</p><p>The estate of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen has sold two apartments on Manhattan's Upper East Side for $101 million, according to property records filed Tuesday.</p><p>The sale includes a penthouse apartment as well as a second unit on a lower floor in the building, records show. The identity of the buyer, who purchased under a Delaware limited liability company, could not immediately be determined.</p><p>If considered as one property, Mr. Allen's is among the most expensive ever sold in New York City, records show. While the record for a New York home was set in 2019 by the sale of an apartment at 220 Central Park South for $238 million to hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, very few sales in the city have ever crossed the $100 million mark. The transaction is the most expensive co-op sale in New York history, besting the previous record of $77.5 million set in 2015 by the sale of an apartment at 834 Fifth Avenue, according to appraiser Jonathan Miller.</p><p>The property was not publicly listed at the time of the sale, according to listings websites.</p><p>Records show Mr. Allen purchased the penthouse unit for $25 million in 2011. It wasn't clear how much he had paid for the other unit, which he purchased earlier. A representative for a company that held some of Mr. Allen's real-estate assets did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The building, at 4 East 66th Street, is one of the most sought after residences in Manhattan's Lenox Hill, according to listings website StreetEasy. It was built by James E.R. Carpenter in 1920 and has only 16 apartments, according to the site. </p><p>The building, at 4 East 66th Street, is one of the most sought after residences in Manhattan's Lenox Hill, according to listings website StreetEasy.

Flowers recently purchased a unit there for $43 million, records show. In 2016, hedge-funder Daniel Nir and Jill E. Braufman sold their fifth-floor unit at the building for $52 million.</p><p>Mr. Allen was an avid collector of trophy real estate. When he died, he left behind a 4,000-acre Idaho retreat and hundreds of acres on a peninsula in the San Juan Islands among other properties, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p><p>The property is the latest to be sold by Mr. Allen's estate following his death in 2018. Former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt recently paid $65 million for a prized piece of undeveloped land in Beverly Hills that had been owned by Mr. Allen.</p><p>Betsy Messerschmitt of the Corcoran Group represented Mr. Allen's estate in the deal.</p><p>Write to Katherine Clarke at Katherine.Clarke@wsj.com</p>",
