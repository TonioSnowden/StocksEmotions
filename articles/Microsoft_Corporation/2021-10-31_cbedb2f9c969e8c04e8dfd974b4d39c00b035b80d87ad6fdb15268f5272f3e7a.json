  "text": "<p>A new front has opened in the battle to dominate digital entertainment. Netflix announced earlier this summer that it was venturing into video games. Last month it acquired game developer <a href=\"https://nightschoolstudio.com/joining-netflix/\">Night School Studio</a> for an undisclosed sum. Amazon, which has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into gaming, finally had a hit with new online game <em>New World</em>.</p> <p>The video game industry has become one of the world's most popular — and lucrative — forms of entertainment. Video games generated nearly $178bn in global revenues last year, according to Newzoo, a market research group. That figure is projected to surpass $200bn by 2023.</p> <p>For Amazon and Netflix, adding games to their platforms could attract more subscribers. Or at the very least dissuade existing ones from leaving. After a pandemic-induced jump in users, Netflix <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\">dropped 430,000 subscribers</a> in the US and Canada in the second quarter. It regained some of these in the <a href=\"https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/FINAL-Q3-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\">third quarter.</a> Netflix has said in the past that in the “attention economy” it competes against video games just as much as rival video streaming services.</p> <p>But gaming is a difficult market to enter. For every blockbuster such as <em>Minecraft</em> or <em>Fortnite</em> there are thousands of flops. Netflix hopes to leverage the success of shows like <em>Stranger Things</em> into video game hits. But good games need more than recognisable names. Development requires different infrastructure and talents. </p> <p>Just ask Disney. The entertainment juggernaut shut down its games studio in 2016 and transitioned to a licensing model. Amazon — whose gaming push includes its near-$1bn acquisition of video-streaming service Twitch and the launch of gaming streaming service Luna — cancelled or ended at least four video games before <em>New World</em>.</p> <p>Established game makers such as Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft all make money from selling games and consoles. Free-to-play mobile games as in <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> get users to make in-game purchases. Netflix's plan is to add games for free and as a loss leader to woo more subscribers. </p> <p>The sweet spot may not be in making games at all. Apple and Google sell and distribute games from their app stores and take a cut of as much as 30 per cent from each sale. No wonder established game makers are more concerned about middlemen than new entrants. </p><p>Source:  2021 'Netflix/Amazon: video games market has tech giants fighting over the controls ' FT.com 31 October.
