  "title": "Apple Posts Highest  Spring Profit Ever  ----  By Tim Higgins",
  "text": "<p>    Apple Inc. posted the highest spring-quarter profit in its 45-year history, leading a streak of record-setting earnings for technology companies even as the pandemic continued to evolve. </p><p>   Not to be overlooked, Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. also said on Tuesday that their quarterly earnings surpassed records, underscoring how the pandemic has shifted life and work online and strengthened some of the world's biggest and wealthiest companies. </p><p>    The Cupertino, Calif., tech company earned $21.7 billion for the three-month period that ended in June. On a per share basis, the company earned $1.30, which exceeded analysts' expectations for $1.01. Revenue rose 36% from a year earlier to $81.4 billion, beating expectations. </p><p>   Apple is on pace for its best fiscal year ever with a projected profit of $86 billion for the 12-month period ending in September, according to an average forecast of analysts surveyed by FactSet. That would be about 51% better than last year's record. A year ago, analysts were predicting what now seems like a paltry 11% gain. </p><p>   \"This quarter saw a growing sense of optimism from consumers in the United States and around the world, driving renewed hope for a better future and for all that innovation can make possible,\" Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said. \"But as the last 18 months have demonstrated many times before, progress made is not progress guaranteed.\" </p><p>   Alphabet more than doubled its profit to $18.5 billion after the pandemic accelerated online purchases for groceries and other products, as well as streaming video consumption, bolstering the company's digital advertising growth. </p><p>   Microsoft posted record quarterly sales after winning new customers for its booming cloud-computing business, Teams workplace collaboration software and videogame offerings. </p><p>   The software company said revenue rose 21% to $46 billion. Net income was $16.5 billion. </p><p>   The three companies, which now have a market value of around $6 trillion, had about $57 billion in profit, or about $620 million a day during the April-to-June time frame. </p><p>   Despite the record results, Apple shares fell more than 2% during after-hour trading after the company warned that its rate of growth won't continue. </p><p>   Microsoft also fell after its videogame business failed to keep pace with its lofty, pandemic-era growth, an indication that investors remain concerned about how tech companies will hold on to the gains of the past year. </p><p>   \"Investors believe the good times will soon slow,\" said Gene Munster, managing partner at Loup Ventures, a venture-capital firm specializing in tech research. \"At the root of tonight's selloff is the question of the sustainability of the strength. The numbers are so impressive, comps get difficult and it's hard for investors to believe the epic growth will continue.\" </p><p>   Investors came into 2021 expecting big things from Apple because of the iPhone 12 lineup and its 5G cellular connectivity. </p><p>   Mr. Cook has outdone even lofty expectations, benefiting from two developments: the first iPhone in three years with technological advances perceived by longtime customers as worth a new purchase, and stronger-than-expected demand for laptops and iPad tablets by workers and students stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>   Sales from iPhones rose 50% to $39.6 billion during the April-to-June period compared with a year earlier. </p><p>   \"The iPhone 12 family continues to do incredibly well,\" Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said in an interview. </p><p>   While iPhone sales traditionally fall off in the year after a big launch, the excitement of 5G might carry through fiscal 2022. </p><p>   \"With close to 1 billion iPhones in use globally, the 5G upgrade opportunity remains significant, with current U.S. carrier promotions an added tailwind,\" William Power, an analyst for Robert W. Baird &amp; Co., wrote in a note to investors this week. </p><p>   For the year ending in September, analysts were predicting Apple's total iPhone revenue would rise 36% compared with fiscal 2020 and stay at about the same level in 2022 before declining a bit in 2023. </p><p>   A top concern for investors is the outlook for the current quarter and details about how prepared the company is to handle the microprocessor shortage roiling the tech and auto industries. </p><p>   So far, Apple has been able to avoid big disruptions. But in April, the company cautioned that the usual drop in sales in the third quarter compared with the second quarter would be greater than normal. </p><p>   At the time, Mr. Maestri attributed this, in part, to an expected chip shortage, hurting sales by as much as $4 billion. </p><p>   This year, sales between the periods fell 8.5% but the effect on revenue wasn't as bad as expected. In an interview, Mr. Maestri said revenue was affected \"just below $3 billion.\" </p><p>   Sales in fiscal 2019 fell 7% between the second and third quarters while declining 13% in those periods in 2018. The outlier was last year when sales fueled by pandemic buying rose 2.4%. </p><p>   Part of the drop between this year's quarters is because of stronger-than-usual demand for the iPhone in the quarter that ended in March. The launch of the iPhone 12 lineup with 5G cellular connectivity was delayed in 2020 because of the outbreak of Covid-19. </p><p></p>",
