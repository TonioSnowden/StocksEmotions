  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>War in Ukraine is acting as a “multiplier of disruption in an already disrupted world” says FT chief economics commentator<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4bde497-edbf-4baa-bfa3-d06b07c63f79\"> Martin Wolf</a> in his latest column.</p> <p>Nowhere is this more true than in energy (see below) and global food markets, our two big stories today.</p> <p>As our <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/ukraine-war-food-insecurity/\">Big Read</a> details, Ukraine is known as the breadbasket of Europe for good reason. It is one of the key suppliers of agricultural commodities such as wheat and corn as well as almost a third of the world's sunflower oil, benefiting from richly fertile soil and deep seaports to facilitate international trade.</p> <p>All that however has been thrown into jeopardy since Russia's invasion, as farmlands turn into battlefields and transport infrastructure gets smashed, creating hunger across the country and global supplies left short.</p> <p>Food prices have increased hugely in response: “The cost is devastating, and it has consequences which are going beyond the borders of Ukraine,” commented Arif Husain, chief economist at the World Food Programme. For poorer countries already struggling with the economic impact of Covid-19, the impact is appalling as prices of fertiliser, animal food and fuel shoot up.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/9534630.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>There is also a growing problem of crop protectionism. Indonesia, the world's biggest exporter of palm oil,&#xa0;this week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38b6df62-e863-4ba1-8274-138ccb2b061b\">banned supplies leaving the country</a> in a bid to contain surging domestic prices. One analyst said the move was “yet another reminder of the vulnerability present across agricultural supply chains in an environment of already historically tight inventories, compounded by the indefinite loss of Ukrainian export volumes and historically high production costs.”</p> <p>There is hope that some of the strain may be alleviated from supplies in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8d99c75-0a6e-4613-99b8-64dc05f6f6ea\">Latin America</a>, but the outlook remains bleak. </p> <p>Surging food prices are also moving their way up domestic political agendas. We report today on tensions at the heart of the UK government over whether Britain should unilaterally <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/971213de-5fb7-4cf8-a659-3ec0ec153e2f\">cut tariffs on food imports</a> after new data showed grocery prices have risen 5.9 per cent in the past year, equivalent to £271 a year for the average household, the biggest jump since December 2011. </p> <p>But in other parts of the world, the situation is much more serious. As Martin Wolf notes: “This war follows pestilence and threatens famine. Together these are three of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse\">Ezekiel's four “disastrous” judgments</a> of the Lord. Alas, the fourth, death, follows from the other three.”</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>UK government's Covid care home policies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b0d9459-e9b8-47e8-96cc-0840a3051e25\">were unlawful</a>, High Court rules</p></li>  <li><p>Spotify chief plays down any <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b5aac6f-c37f-4748-854a-83410cab24fa\">similarities with Netflix</a> as the latter loses subscribers </p></li>  <li><p>Euro hits <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b81f2134-5fca-4447-8a46-3c86cb0da4c7\">five-year low</a> against dollar on expectations the ECB will take a slower path to monetary tightening than the US Federal Reserve</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7945d42-9cbc-401c-939b-c331f4f359a2\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>European gas prices surged today after <strong>Gazprom</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2eea1a1-f72a-43c4-aa93-4e5477b5ead4\">cut off supplies</a> to Poland and Bulgaria because they had failed to make payments in roubles, its new precondition.

Official data showed many households were being forced to borrow money to pay their bills, with nine in 10 adults reporting a rise in expenses between March 16 and 27, up from 62 per cent in November.</p> <p>Fortunately Johnson's chancellor Rishi Sunak has more scope to address the crisis now that <strong>government borrowing</strong> has halved as the economy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38eafe3c-0a9c-4be1-bdf0-aa1e66307d80\">springs back to life</a> and taxes roll in. <strong>Trade news</strong> on the other hand is a lot bleaker: post-Brexit red tape, customs controls and taxes have caused many small businesses to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0860ee6-e06e-4fc4-bd87-d56dcc7ee946\">stop trading with Europe</a>.
