  "text": "<p>   Amazon.com Inc. capped off its pandemic-fueled 2020 financial performance with record quarterly sales driven by a surge in online holiday shopping as founder Jeff Bezos said he would hand over the chief-executive role to a new leader. </p><p>   The e-commerce giant posted fourth-quarter sales of $125.5 billion and net income of $7.2 billion. It marked the first time Amazon reported more than $100 billion in quarterly revenue, days after Apple Inc. hit that financial milestone. </p><p>   Few companies have seen growth take off like Amazon during the global health crisis. The explosion in online shopping vaulted the company's sales to record figures as the e-commerce sector grew by around 50% throughout last year, according to some analysts. Roughly 40% of online shopping in the U.S. happens at Amazon, according to research firm eMarketer, helping drive a 76% increase in the company's share price last year and raising its market valuation to more than $1.6 trillion. </p><p>   Sales in the December quarter received an added boost from Amazon's annual \"Prime Day\" shopping event moved from its usual summer schedule to October due to the pandemic. Amazon makes billions of dollars from the' event. </p><p>   Amazon sales for all of 2020 rose 38% year over year to $386.1 billion and are expected to advance again this year. Amazon said sales for the current quarter should come in at between $100 billion and $106 billion. Wall Street has forecast sales of around $95.8 billion. Shares in Amazon rose 1.6% in after-hours trading. </p><p>   The online shopping boom has been broad-based. United Parcel Service Inc. Tuesday said sales in the December quarter rose 21%. The package-delivery giant said Amazon accounted for 13% of its total 2020 sales. </p><p>   Although the pandemic turned into a sales bonanza for Amazon, the Seattle-based company initially struggled to handle surging demand. The company recovered in part by scaling up rapidly. It added more than 500,000 employees, lifting its global workforce to more than 1.3 million and increased its fulfillment and logistics square footage by about 50% last year. It also incurred around $11.5 billion in Covid-related costs last year, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts on a call Tuesday. Amazon also spent around $44 billion to expand, he said, including on its transportation network. </p><p>   The efforts appeared to pay off. \"There was a flight to reliability from consumers throughout the year, and that was especially true during the holiday seasons when there were shipping concerns,\" said Andrew Lipsman, an eMarketer analyst. \"That advantaged Amazon.\" </p><p>   Amazon's other major business, the cloud-computing services, where the company rents server capacity and software tools, also saw strong demand during the pandemic with companies broadly accelerating their digital investments. </p><p>   Amazon Web Services has been the company's main profit driver. The pace of growth in that segment has slowed, though, as its scale has increased and rivals such as Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google have pushed to steal market share. </p><p>   AWS, as the cloud business is known, generated a little over 10% of Amazon's total sales in the December quarter but accounted for more than half of the company's operating income. In the period, AWS sales rose 28% from a year earlier to $12.7 billion. Amazon is the world's largest cloud provider. </p><p>   Spending plans for this year, Mr. Olsavsky said, are still in flux, though the company is likely to make further investments, in part to ensure Amazon's cloud-computing services can keep pace with demand. \"We definitely do not want to run out of capacity,\" he said. </p><p>   Amazon also has been building up its advertisement business where it competes with companies such as Facebook Inc. and Google. Amazon said sales in the segment that includes advertising revenue rose 64% from the year before to roughly $8 billion. </p><p>   The company's results add to a strong earnings season for Big Tech, underscoring how the pandemic has lifted those companies' fortunes while devastating other sectors of the economy. Microsoft last week posted record quarterly sales driven by increased demand for videogames and accelerated adoption of its cloud-computing services. Apple and Facebook finished their fiscal years with their most profitable quarters ever. </p><p>   Amazon's success has come while the company confronts regulatory and labor battles. The Federal Trade Commission Tuesday said Amazon would make a $61.7 million payment over its failure in the past to pay some Amazon Flex drivers the full amount of tips they received from customers. Amazon, the FTC said, ended the practice in 2019 only once it became aware of the federal investigation of its practices. </p><p>   \"While we disagree that the historical way we reported pay to drivers was unclear, we added additional clarity in 2019 and are pleased to put this matter behind us,\" an Amazon spokeswoman said. </p><p></p>",
