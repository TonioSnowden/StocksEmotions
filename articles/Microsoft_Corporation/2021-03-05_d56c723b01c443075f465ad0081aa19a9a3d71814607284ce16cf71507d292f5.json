  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Insuretech Firm Hippo to List via SPAC  ----  By Leslie Scism",
  "text": "<p>   Home-insurance technology upstart Hippo Enterprises Inc. is teaming with a special-purpose acquisition company to go public, the latest insuretech business to tap equity markets and challenge traditional insurers head-on. </p><p>   The six-year-old Hippo, based in Palo Alto, Calif., will go public through a merger with Reinvent Technology Partners Z in a deal that values the firm at $5 billion, the companies said. Reinvent Technology Partners Z had an initial public offering of stock in November. </p><p>   Reinvent's co-directors are LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Mark Pincus, founder of game maker Zynga Inc. </p><p>   Hippo's move will provide funding as it continues a transition from being a partner to insurance carriers that provides a digital-sales channel for them to being both a partner and a direct competitor. Last year, the company bought Spinnaker Insurance Co., a property-casualty insurer licensed in 50 states, and it aims to increase the number of policies it issues. </p><p>   To size up risk in homes, Hippo's online underwriting technology uses aerial imagery to assess roof conditions and uses building permits to provide details of home features, for instance. </p><p>   The firm seeks to distinguish itself by stressing proactive insurance services that can help homeowners avoid claims, such as free water-sensor devices to detect leaks and discounted burglar-alarm systems. </p><p>   \"Our guiding principle is that the best claim is one that never happens,\" said Assaf Wand, Hippo's chief executive and co-founder. He said becoming a carrier is the best way for the company to control its own path, including offering policies with expansive coverage for electronic gear and home offices. </p><p>   Hippo expects to have up to $1.2 billion in cash as a result of the transaction to fund growth and operations, the companies said. The transaction includes approximately $550 million in fundraising from investors including Dragoneer Investment Group, Lennar Corp. and Ribbit Capital, the companies said. Mutual funds also are investing. </p><p>   In 2020, five property-and-casualty technology startups either formed a carrier or announced the acquisition of one, up from three in 2019 and one in 2018, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. </p><p>   Becoming a carrier gives an insuretech company more revenue potential, said Thomas Mason, a senior research analyst at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, \"since the company will receive the policyholder's premium payments rather than just a percentage commission on each sale.\" </p><p>   On the flip side, it \"is more capital-intensive, inherently riskier and requires additional expertise in areas like reserving and investing,\" he said. </p><p>   The transformations from digital agency to full-fledged insurer are possible partly because ample venture-firm capital is available to help with the costs, analysts and consultants said. The trend \"is likely to continue in 2021, which will in turn spur more private-capital raises, M&amp;A activity and new carrier formations,\" Mr. Mason said. </p><p></p>",
