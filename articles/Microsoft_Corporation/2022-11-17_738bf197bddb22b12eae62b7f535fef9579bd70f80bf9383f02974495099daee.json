  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start:</strong> More than 150 retired EY partners have written to the accounting firm's leadership <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/53bd8a2c-39ca-4a08-9be0-d08944b6a20f\">objecting to the radical plan</a> to split its consulting and audit businesses, according to a<a href=\"https://d1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net/production/uploaded-files/EY%20retired%20partners-111c703a-0822-4ffb-8a6e-59cd11128a59.pdf\"> three-page memo</a> seen by the FT.</p> <p><strong>In today's newsletter:</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p>Musk faces off against Tesla shareholders</p></li>  <li><p>Wall Street turns on Trump</p></li>  <li><p>Brookfield and the music biz</p></li> </ul> <h1>Musk takes the stand&#xa0;</h1> <p><strong>Elon Musk </strong>appreciated the respite from chaotically running Twitter, where of late he has been demanding employees <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/082f3860-37fc-4e45-ab92-0da9ea3c508b\">commit to being “hardcore”</a> or leave.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the beleaguered richest man in the world was in Wilmington, Delaware, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61dccf45-10f7-4995-b002-1c529de72a29\">to be grilled as a witness</a> in the<strong> Delaware Court of Chancery</strong>.</p> <p>Shareholders of his electric carmaker <strong>Tesla </strong>had sued him and the company's board of directors over a massive stock option grant that he was given in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14e3c290-b406-40b6-afd5-d2ec390419ef\">which could be worth up to $56bn</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The shareholders claim that the board was inappropriately controlled by Musk and the options grant had eventually swelled his stake in the company to over 50 per cent — his wealth in the company eventually approached $200bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>The generous remuneration package, they said, cheated stockholders as Musk attempted “to fund his personal ambition to colonize Mars”, according to court papers.</p> <p>“If I over-allocate time to Tesla . . . I am not sure that would serve the greater good,” Musk testified that he told board members during negotiations over the pay package. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Musk's defence of his remuneration has been simple and consistent. He might've gotten rich, but Tesla shareholders got richer.</p> <p>His lawyers have consistently used the same defence: “Under Musk's leadership, Tesla's value has increased by more than 1,200% since the Plan was implemented — from about $53 billion to over $690 billion — making Tesla the sixth most valuable company in the world,” they wrote in court briefs.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Musk's testimony veered to other topics. He offered his thoughts on the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission, </strong>which has sanctioned him over his aborted attempt to take Tesla private. </p> <p>“Why was there no attention given to<strong> FTX</strong>, investors lost billions, and yet the SEC continues to haunt me,” he said of the crypto exchange's high-profile bankruptcy. “It makes no sense.”&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Alas, <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong> might be the one person on this planet feeling more pressure than Musk. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BondHack/status/1592991809525157889\">Not that he's showing it</a>.</p> <h1>Wall Street cancels Trump? </h1> <p>The year is 2020. The day is November 5.<strong> Donald Trump</strong> takes to the podium at the White House and doubles down on baseless claims that Democrats were seeking to “steal” the election. </p> <p>The following morning in an emergency meeting of corporate leaders, <strong>Blackstone</strong> founder <strong>Stephen Schwarzman</strong> sought to assuage his fellow executives' worries, saying the president was within his rights to challenge election results, and predicting that the legal process would take its course.</p> <p>This week the former president <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32832f0e-57e2-4d7b-8bb3-1e3e8218c109\">announced his intentions</a> to Make America Great Again . . . again. </p> <p>This time, the private equity billionaire <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d17ad1c3-2be0-4a2e-94bf-8e7da3f23dc5\">will be supporting a different candidate</a>: “America does better when its leaders are rooted in today and tomorrow, not today and yesterday. It is time for the Republican Party to turn to a new generation of leaders and I intend to support one of them in the presidential primaries,” Schwarzman said.</p> <p>Sad!</p> <p>Schwarzman was quick to align with Trump after his surprise 2016 victory, helping to convene a panel of senior business figures to offer advice on jobs and the economy, and accompanying the new president on a visit to Saudi Arabia, the first foreign trip of his term.</p> <p>Their relationship sometimes paid dividends for Schwarzman's private equity firm. In 2017, Riyadh pledged to match up to $20bn in contributions from other investors to a Blackstone fund that planned to invest in power plants, toll roads and similar assets, mostly in the US.</p> <p>But it also attracted controversy. After a 2017 gathering of rightwing extremists in Charlottesville, Virginia culminated in the murder of a counter-protester, Schwarzman said he received hundreds of emails accusing him of being a Nazi.</p> <p>Schwarzman's advisory panel disbanded itself soon after Trump proclaimed there was “blame on both sides” of the Charlottesville protests. Schwarzman has said he “wasn't outraged” by the remarks.</p> <p>The Blackstone boss was not the only one to turn his back on The Donald this week.</p> <p><strong>Citadel </strong>founder <strong>Ken Griffin</strong>, who called the former president “a three-time loser”,&#xa0;announced he would back a potential 2024 White House run by <strong>Ron DeSantis</strong>.</p> <p>There was also <strong>Rupert Murdoch</strong>'s New York Post, which dismissed Trump's opening campaign speech with a strapline at the bottom of its front page that did not name the former Potus, referring to him merely as “Florida man”.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Jared Kushner</strong> and<strong> Ivanka Trump </strong><a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/11/ivanka-jared-quiet-quitting-donald-trump.html\">“quiet quitting”</a> his campaign, as New York Magazine puts it, had to hurt a little, too.</p> <p>Perhaps it was the two impeachments, the January 6 2021 riots, or the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82847425-33a1-4802-ae73-b2a3251ec7c5\">allegations of fraud</a> against his business. Maybe it was the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78492903-c8db-4e1c-a268-2035f0ba3d55\">disappointing performance</a> by election deniers and other candidates handpicked by the former president in the midterms that has steered Republicans <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a45a6563-a597-4720-80a2-d61bcca703fd\">towards other options</a>.</p> <p>“Trump's donor base is not what it was two years ago,” said GOP donor <strong>Dan Eberhart</strong>, who gave $100,000 to Trump's re-election campaign. “The consensus seems to be ready for new blood.”</p> <h1>Brookfield puts $2bn in the jukebox</h1> <p>Wall Street <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e879f856-3ec3-4bd7-b564-ada5b590e3ef\">has been pouring cash</a> into music royalties at a record pace, the latest entrant to the biz being financial behemoth <strong>Brookfield Asset Management</strong>.</p> <p>The investment group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab652113-ccbc-47cc-81d6-508c3ce8e092\">has acquired the copyrights</a> to <strong>Whitney Houston</strong>'s hit songs including “How Will I Know” and “I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)” as part of a multibillion-dollar push into music in partnership with publisher<strong> Primary Wave</strong>, the FT's Anna Nicolaou revealed.</p> <p>“It's one of the larger acquisitions we have done,” said<strong> Larry Mestel</strong>, chief executive of Primary Wave, which is managing the $2bn Brookfield-funded investment vehicle.</p> <p>The Canadian asset manager follows Wall Street titans including <strong>Pimco</strong>, Blackstone, and <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> into the music industry, as song royalties have become more attractive investments in the streaming era for their ability to generate consistent, bond-like cash flows.</p> <p>Song valuations have soared as a result, although prices have recently fallen. Primary Wave isn't deterred.</p> <p>“It's like a Basquiat or a Warhol. These are very unique pieces of art that happen to generate substantial income,” said Mestel. </p> <p>There have been other signs of trouble. Song-buying pioneer <strong>Merck Mercuriadis</strong>, who launched his London-listed <strong>Hipgnosis Songs Fund</strong> in 2018, has been unable to raise new cash for the listed vehicle as its share price dwindles. (The subsequent lack of dealmaking <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66ba0aa3-4787-42c5-a024-e54bd0058bb0\">even led to a feud</a> involving Blackstone boss Schwarzman and a Grammy-winning artist.)</p> <p>Houston's voice has stood the test of time. Brookfield's music chops, on the other hand, have yet to be proven.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Nick Jones</strong>, the founder of private members' club<strong> Soho House</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a7694e2-38c8-4376-a9b8-afb9901ef6f1\">has decided to step back</a> from his role as chief executive after revealing he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer.
