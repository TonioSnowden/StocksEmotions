  "text": "<p>Good afternoon from London. As the year comes to an end, workplace problems can lead to priority overload. Do you have any tips on how to deal with the pressure?</p> <p>Also, we're inviting you to take part in our <a href=\"https://www.ft-rankings.com/se/705E3EC81591E7E3\">newsletter feedback survey to tell us what can be improved</a>.</p> <p>We will be taking time off and our newsletter will return on 10 January 2022. We wish you a happy and healthy festive season.</p> <p>Thank you for reading our Business School Briefing — <em><strong>Wai Kwen Chan and&#xa0;Andrew Jack.</strong></em></p> <h2>Tell us what you think of our newsletter</h2> <p>We want to hear what you would like to read, what content we should keep or ditch. <a href=\"https://www.ft-rankings.com/se/705E3EC81591E7E3\">Please take our survey</a>.</p> <h2>Andrew Hill's management challenge</h2> <p>Tiny management flaws can open into gaping chasms under pressure,&#xa0;as the debacle over the evacuation of Afghans from Kabul last summer demonstrates. A UK Foreign Office whistleblower highlighted last week how a nightmarish overload of email requests for rescue from the Taliban led to arbitrary decisions about who should be airlifted.</p> <p>Few managers will have to handle situations with the life-and-death consequences I've&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8b8694c-6766-4dda-929c-0c53d61b0ca7\">described in my latest column</a>, but the end of the year often leads to&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c005c34-ba66-4cec-9c0b-65488ce04b5a\">priority overload</a>. For my&#xa0;<strong>management challenge</strong>&#xa0;this week, I'd like to hear your tips about dealing with overwhelming pressure, whether that be a surge in demand or a coincidence of pressing deadlines. Send your tips for triage to&#xa0;<a href=\"mailto:bschool@ft.com\">bschool@ft.com</a>&#xa0;and we will print the best in January, by way of New Year resolutions.</p> <p>Two weeks ago I asked for ways to remind directors and executives of the lessons of the Enron scandal 20 years ago. Alessandro Zattoni, who teaches the Enron case, says “People think that [corporate governance] is about rules and sanctions, but the key is education, ethics and values. If and how companies create a good and ethical culture makes the difference.”</p> <p>In&#xa0;<strong>further reading</strong>, the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/special-series/pandemic-future-work-lifestyle.html?utm_source=pocket_mylist\">New York Times</a>&#xa0;has asked a variety of experts, from chef Vicky Lau to publisher Tina Brown: “Is the world of work forever changed?” Economics Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers have an original take for the economic upheaval, which they call not “the Great Resignation” but “the&#xa0;Great Reallocation. It might be disruptive for a little while, but the result just might be a more humane labour market”.</p> <h2>Data line: Seniority of European business schools alumni</h2> <p>Graduates from <a href=\"https://rankings.ft.com/rankings/2869/european-business-school-rankings-2021\">Europe's leading business schools in the FT ranking</a>, in 2021, tend to go into managerial or executive positions three years after completing their degrees.</p> <p>More Masters in Management graduates enter junior and senior management, while a higher proportion of MBA alumni are in senior manager/executive positions, <em>write Sam Stephens and Leo Cremonezi</em>. More EMBA graduates are in president/MD/CEO and other director/vice-president roles.
