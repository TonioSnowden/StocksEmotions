Her last day at Amazon was Friday, she said in a LinkedIn post.</p><p>Amazon co-founded the climate pledge in 2019 as a way to encourage businesses to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.</p><p>Before Amazon, Ms. Ooton worked for Coca-Cola Co., where she led the development and execution of quality, safety and environmental policies and practices across the company, the release stated.</p><p>Ms. Ooton is the third executive in an ESG or sustainability-focused role that Apollo has hired in recent months.</p><p>Earlier this fall, the firm added Michael Kashani as head of ESG for its credit business and hired Dave Stangis as chief sustainability officer, a newly created role. Mr. Stangis founded impact advisory firm 21C Impact and earlier served as chief sustainability officer for Campbell Soup Co. Mr. Kashani previously served as head of ESG for portfolio management in the fixed-income unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s asset management arm, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p><p>Apollo is among a growing number of private-markets firms adding ESG experts to their teams as investor scrutiny of corporate progress on ESG intensifies and as methods used to measure and manage ESG metrics expand. Last month, for example, Blackstone Inc. added Amisha Parekh as global head of ESG for its private-equity operations.</p><p>Preeti Singh contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Laura Kreutzer at laura.kreutzer@wsj.com</p>",
