  "title": "Google Ads Propel Alphabet Profit  ---  Revenue hits record  with strong online  holiday spending;  cloud unit shows loss  ----  By Georgia Wells",
  "text": "<p>   Google rode a surge in online holiday spending to record revenue in the fourth quarter, even though it disclosed for the first time continued losses in its closely watched cloud division. </p><p>   The internet titan's earnings, released Tuesday afternoon, reflected a continuing recovery in global ad spending that took a hit in early 2020 when people paused travel plans and other purchases in response to the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>   Google parent Alphabet Inc. posted a record $56.9 billion revenue, up from $43.2 billion a year ago. The company's advertising units pulled in $46.2 billion, up nearly 22% from a year earlier. Analysts had forecast $52.7 billion in revenue, including $42.3 billion from advertising, according to FactSet. </p><p>   Alphabet's profit also rose, to $15.7 billion, from $9.3 billion a year ago. Analysts had expected $11.9 billion. </p><p>   Ruth Porat, Google's finace chief, said the company's search and YouTube units drove its performance in the quarter. </p><p>   \"It was a great end to a challenging year,\" she said. </p><p>   YouTube revenue soared 46% in the quarter, as advertisers flocked to the video-sharing platform amid the pandemic. The company said the platform now reaches more users between the ages of 25 and 49 than all cable networks combined. </p><p>   Alphabet shares jumped more than 7% in after-hours trading. The stock has gained about 17% over the last three months, compared with a roughly 22% gain in the Nasdaq Composite Index. </p><p>   Google also disclosed details about the costs of its cloud division for the first time. While that unit brought in $3.8 billion in revenue, overall it lost $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. This announcement will enable investors to better compare the results of Google's cloud business with those of Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. </p><p>   Meanwhile on Tuesday, Amazon named its cloud computing guru, Andy Jassy, as its next chief executive officer of its entire business, succeeding Jeff Bezos, who will become the e-commerce giant's executive chairman. </p><p>   Analysts had expected Google's cloud business to bring in $3.83 billion in revenue, according to FactSet, compared with $2.61 billion a year ago. </p><p>   Google has managed to sign up some big-name clients for its cloud business. Alphabet's chief executive officer, Sundar Pichai, said Google Cloud deals valued at more than $250 million more than tripled in 2020. </p><p>   The strong holiday season also added to Alphabet's mountain of cash, which stands at $26.5 billion. Alphabet recorded a cash position of $20.1 billion at the start of October. </p><p>   Still, Google is facing growing challenges. A set of antitrust lawsuits allege various abuses of its power over online commerce and digital information. </p><p>   They say Google muscles out competitors and sells out the users it claims to protect. </p><p>   Consumers are also calling for more accountability about how companies use their data. </p><p>   The company has said it plans to restrict the use of third-party cookies in its Chrome internet browser, and on a call with analysts Google's chief business officer, Philipp Schindler, said the company would continue to adjust its policies. </p><p>   \"People are demanding greater privacy,\" Mr. Schindler said. </p><p>   A small number of employees of Google have also formed a union. They have said their efforts reflect a need for employees to be able to speak out about the company without facing career repercussions. </p><p>   On Monday, the Labor Department said Google had agreed to pay more than $3.8 million to resolve a case of hiring and pay discrimination at several locations in California and Washington state. </p><p>   Google said it now has more than 135,000 employees. </p><p></p>",
