  "title": "Technology:  Software  Maker  Unity  Cuts 4%  Of Staff  ----  By Sarah E. Needleman",
  "text": "<p>   Unity Software Inc. has laid off about 4% of its workforce amid growing concerns about the economy. </p><p>   The maker of tools for creating videogames and other applications had 5,864 employees as of March 31, according to a regulatory filing, suggesting that more than 225 jobs may have been eliminated. </p><p>   Another videogaming company, Niantic Inc., said this week that it had laid off about 8% of its workforce and stopped production on some projects. On Wednesday, Substack Inc., a startup that lets writers publish and monetize their own newsletters, laid off 13 of its 94 employees. </p><p>   A possible recession, rising interest rates and falling valuations for stocks have prompted many tech companies to adjust their hiring plans and, in some cases, announce layoffs. </p><p>   On the list of companies that have announced changes: In June, Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk told workers that the company planned to cut 10% of its salaried workforce. Last week, Netflix Inc. said it was laying off about 300 employees globally in its latest round of cuts, as the streaming service tries to control costs. The move follows a previous round of layoffs in May that affected 150 employees. </p><p>   Microsoft Corp. said in May that it would be slowing its hiring pace for its software group that develops Windows, Office and Teams applications. Other top tech players, including Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., Twitter Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., also have said that they would be scaling back or freezing hiring plans. </p><p>   Unity decided on the layoffs  to better match the size of its staff with its needs, a company spokesman said. </p><p>   Tech shares have been among the hardest hit this year with the Nasdaq Composite Index falling close to 30%, outpacing the broader stock-market decline. </p><p></p>",
