  "text": "<p>\"It's going to start a major ripple effect in terms of consolidation for other videogame publishers,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives.</p><p>Deal-making among videogame companies has surged in recent years amid gaming's growing popularity, particularly on mobile devices. Mobile games represent the largest and fastest-growing corner of the videogame industry at large.</p><p>Videogames are also seen by analysts and industry executives as a pathway to the metaverse, the virtual world where people can play and shop using digital avatars.</p><p>Microsoft's purchase of Activision will accelerate more deals in the industry, analysts said, as big tech companies seek to broaden their consumer game offerings. Last week, Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. agreed to buy Zynga Inc. for $11 billion.</p><p>The prospect of more deals led to gains Tuesday among videogame stocks. Electronic Arts gained $3.47, or 2.7%, to $133.91. U.S.-listed shares of Ubisoft rose 8.5%, and Nintendo Co. added 2.2%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
