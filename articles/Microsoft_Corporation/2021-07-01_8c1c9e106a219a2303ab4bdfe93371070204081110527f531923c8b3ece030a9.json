  "title": "Covid-19 data; The global normalcy index",
  "text": "<p>The Economist has devised a “normalcy index” to track how behaviour has changed, and continues to change, because of the pandemic. Our index comprises eight indicators, split into three domains. The first grouping is transport and travel: public transport in big cities; the amount of traffic congestion in those same cities; and the number of international and domestic flights. The second looks at recreation and entertainment: how much time is spent outside the home; cinema box-office revenues (a proxy measure for cinema attendance); and attendance at professional sports events. The third is retailing and work: footfall in shops; and occupancy of offices (measured by workplace footfall in big cities).</p><p>Our index covers 50 of the world's largest economies that together account for 90% of global GDP and 76% of the world's population. Our aggregate measure is the population-weighted average of each country's score. The pre-pandemic level of activity is set at 100 for ease of comparison. The tracker is updated with new data once a week.</p><p>The global normalcy index plummeted in March 2020 as many countries imposed draconian restrictions on their citizens. It fell to just 35 in April 2020, before improving gradually over the following months. Today it stands at 76, suggesting that the world has travelled roughly two-thirds of the way back to pre-pandemic life. Some indicators, such as retail footfall and time spent outside, have recovered faster than others, particularly sports attendance and flights. The global average masks a lot of variation across countries. Click on the drop-down box to explore how behaviour has changed in each one.</p><p>Activity is back at normal levels in just two of the countries we track: Egypt and Pakistan. The reading for China briefly returned to pre-pandemic levels during its celebrations for the lunar new year in February—owing in part to record-breaking box-office receipts. Meanwhile Vietnam, which imposed restrictions after its first significant wave of covid-19 infections caused by the more transmissible Delta variant, continues to prop-up our table.</p><p>The two tables below show the change in the index over the past two weeks. Twenty-nine of the 50 countries we are tracking are moving closer to normality. Taiwan's score has increased the most in recent weeks. A further 20 countries are currently moving away from normalcy. Some countries in Western Europe have recently reimposed restrictions to deal with winter outbreaks of covid-19.</p><p>Public transport has recovered strongly since the onset of the pandemic. Levels of traffic congestion have rebounded, too. Yet many planes remain grounded across the world as quarantine rules impede international travel.</p><p>When lockdowns were at their most stringent, in April 2020, time spent outside the home fell by 20% according to our global average. In contrast, the closure of cinemas and sports stadiums caused activity in those venues to fall to zero. They have been on a slow path to recovery since. Cinemas received a big boost from the release of the long-awaited James Bond film in October, but they have sunk back since.</p><p>Zoom meetings and Amazon deliveries have been two prominent features of the covid-19 pandemic. Most white-collar workers are betting on continued flexibility in how much time they spend in the workplace; office occupancy rates may never return to previous levels. But don't write off bricks and mortar: retail footfall has been remarkably strong since the middle of last year and is now above pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>Download the normalcy index data from our GitHub repository.</p><p>Sources: afltables.com; baseball-freak.com; baseball-reference.com; Box Office Mojo; Google; hockey-reference.com; TomTom; pro-football-reference.com; UN ICAO; Transfermarkt; ultimatealeague.com; Wind; The Economist</p>",
