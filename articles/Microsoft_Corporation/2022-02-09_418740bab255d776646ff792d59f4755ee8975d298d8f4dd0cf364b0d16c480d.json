  "text": "<p>Something succinct, clever and polite is needed. My best retort is, \"I think you know the answer,\" but I welcome better ones from your readers.</p><p>Daniel Pipes</p><p>Philadelphia</p><p>Mr. Pipes founded Campus Watch.</p><p>Gender, like race and class, has always been a malleable structure, overlaid onto our biological form as a related, but never equivalent, set of norms and expectations that evolve as we do. For an evolutionary biologist such as Mr. Wright, I would think humans' ability to overlay biological sex with complex discourse about social roles (a construct found among our predecessors for millions of years), would be considered a triumph of evolution, not something to protect against.</p><p>There's nothing regressive about individuals choosing pronouns, especially when the freedom to do so, like the freedom to go to church or love whom we choose, is highly meaningful to certain people, and inconsequential to the rest of us. The suggestion that pronouns are a threat to feminism's idea of the multifaceted woman or man is impossible to grasp. Why would adding new pronouns, as we add words annually to our dictionaries, threaten to calcify the existing ones? Perhaps it's because Mr. Wright sees the pronoun question as a semantic \"Trojan horse\" rather than another cultural shift.</p><p>Charlie Habegger</p><p>Richmond, Calif.</p><p>The hijacking of the pronoun custom by the woke mob is a shame. As U.S. immigration comes more and more from non-European countries, there are many new Americans whose first names are unfamiliar. Some of them leave many Americans at a loss as to their gender, especially as so many professional interactions now happen remotely. The impulse is not to offend, but short of a Google image search, it can be tricky figuring out which pronouns to use, and prompting would be helpful.</p><p>But for Mary and Tom? That's virtue signaling. If such a person lists pronouns on a resum√© or LinkedIn profile, don't hire that person. This type is never going to be a happy employee and is bound to make everyone else's lives miserable at work.</p><p>Christopher Stephens</p><p>New York</p><p>How are they even \"my\" pronouns? They're intended to be used by literally everyone else. We need a more apt phrase, conveying the forced imposition of an arbitrary doctrine. We could call it \"my fiat.\"</p><p>Olev Jaakson</p><p>Washington</p><p>While refusing to answer is certainly effective, an even better response might be: \"My pronouns are grammatically and biologically correct.\" Alternatively, for us older folks, there's always: \"My pronouns are what they've been for the past 7+ decades.\"</p><p>Bob Earl</p><p>Bellingham, Wash.</p><p>How to Answer When Asked for Your Pronouns</p>",
