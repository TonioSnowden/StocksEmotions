  "title": "Stocks Rocket Back to Finish Higher After Deep Slump; The Dow has never before closed positive after being down at least 1000 points",
  "text": "<p>Popular technology stocks such as Tesla and chip maker Nvidia were hard-hit early on but later rebounded. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was down as much as 4.9% but ultimately advanced 86.21, or 0.6%, to close at 13855.13. The gyrations extended to the cryptocurrency markets. Bitcoin dipped at one point below $33,000—less than half the market value of its November high—but later rallied to about $36,851, a gain of 4.1% from Sunday.</p><p>Behind the volatility was investor anxiety over the Federal Reserve and how quickly it will move to combat inflation. Investors are bracing for a Fed meeting this week in which the U.S. central bank is expected to shed more light on its plans for hiking rates and lowering the size of its balance sheet.</p><p>\"The Fed was way behind the curve on inflation,\" said Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. She expects the Fed to hike interest rates four times in 2022 and to start shrinking its bond holdings.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 climbed 12.19 on Monday, or 0.3%, to 4410.13. At its lowest point on Monday, the broad index was in correction territory, defined as a 10% drop from a recent high. It ended the day about 8% below its record from three weeks ago.</p><p>Short-term bond yields dropped in a sign that some investors were starting to bet that the Fed might raise interest rates less aggressively than previously thought. The yield on the two-year Treasury note settled at 0.950%, according to Tradeweb, down from 0.993% Friday.</p><p>Interest-rate derivatives suggested investors saw a 58% chance that the Fed will raise rates by 0.25 percentage point at least four times this year, down from 67% Friday, according to CME Group.</p><p>The market was also spooked by mounting tensions between the West and Russia over the military buildup on the border with Ukraine.</p><p>Retailers were among the surprising winners in Monday's rollercoaster markets. Gap was the best performer in the S&amp;P 500, climbing $1.26 a share, of 7.9%, to $17.12.</p><p>Among the day's losers were Airbnb, which tumbled $8.83 a share, or 5.6%, to $147.90. Netflix shares dropped $10.35, or 2.6%, to $387.15, adding to their losses after the streaming company warned last week of slowing subscriber growth.</p><p>So-called meme stocks popular with individual investors took a beating. GameStop and AMC Entertainment both dropped more than 5%. Both stocks have lost more than 30% of their value since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Stocks coasted higher for much of the past year, repeatedly smashing records as investors treated every short-lived dip as a buying opportunity. But that mentality has shifted in 2022 as the rally lost one of its biggest friends: the Fed keeping interest rates at rock-bottom levels during the pandemic to juice economic activity.</p><p>The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 1.735% from 1.747% Friday as investors sought the safety of government bonds. Yields move in the opposite direction from prices.</p><p>Fears of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine are weighing on markets, analysts said. The State Department on Sunday instructed the families of U.S. diplomats in Ukraine to leave the country, while the White House is considering sending several thousand troops to Europe.</p><p>War in Ukraine and its possible consequences—including the potential closure of the U.S. financial system to Russian banks—could play out in markets in unpredictable ways, said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.</p><p>\"The closer you get to the cliff, the more nervous [the market] is,\" Mr. Galy said. \"We don't have the information to trade.\"</p><p>The Russian ruble fell 1.6% against the dollar.</p><p>Investors are looking ahead to a fresh batch of corporate earnings reports, including from some big tech companies. General Electric, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla are all due to report quarterly results later in the week. Of the 65 companies in the S&amp;P 500 that filed results through midday Monday, nearly 77% beat analysts' expectations, according to Refinitiv.</p><p>Oil prices retreated on Monday. Brent crude futures, the benchmark in international energy markets, fell 1.8% to settle at $86.27 a barrel.</p><p>European markets dropped sharply. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 tumbled 3.8%, its worst one-day percentage drop in since June 2020, dragged down by shares of travel, leisure, and basic-resource companies.</p><p>Unilever bucked the trend, jumping 7.3% after reports that activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management had bought a stake in the packaged-food and consumer-goods company in the wake of its failed bid for part of GlaxoSmithKline.</p><p>Asian markets were mixed. Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 1.2%, while the Shanghai Composite Index was flat and Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.2%.</p><p>—Rebecca Feng and Sam Goldfarb contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@wsj.com and Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rocket Back to Finish Higher After Deep Slump</p>",
