  "text": "<p>AT&amp;T acquired the advertising technology company formerly known as AppNexus in 2018for about $1.6 billion with an aim to challenge heavyweights such as Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook in the digital ad market.</p><p>Xandr's online ad exchange allows advertisers to buy space across thousands of websites and target audiences. AT&amp;T executives hoped to appeal to marketers by combining the unit with TV ad space on channels such as TNT and CNN as well as its data about wireless subscribers.</p><p>The unit failed to yield the explosive revenue growth its owners hoped to generate and often struggled with technical problems familiar to tech companies that invest billions of dollars a year in their ad exchange technology.</p><p>The media and telecom conglomerate has been exploring alternatives for some of its assets to focus on its wireless business and bolster its balance sheet. AT&amp;T agreed to sell a stake in its DirecTV business to private-equity firm TPG and struck a deal to merge its WarnerMedia business with Discovery Inc.</p><p>Microsoft's search advertising business had revenue of $8.5 billion in the year ending June 30, 2021, making up about 5% of the tech giant's revenue. The company makes money by selling ads on various services, including its Bing search engine, business-focused social-media platform LinkedIn and in its videogaming platform.</p><p>Write to Kimberly Chin at kimberly.chin@wsj.com</p><p>AT&amp;T to Sell Digital Ad Tech Platform Xandr to Microsoft</p>",
