  "text": "<p>Justin Overdorff, a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners, said while he thinks fintech interest is nascent, \"I think the thing to look out for is a broader downward pressure macro cycle where prices tighten and as a result venture investment dollars recede making it much harder for companies to raise capital.\"</p><p>Eric Byunn, a partner at Centana Growth Partners, said fintech advancements are only in the early stages and that shifts in regulation, security and digital identity will continue to drive innovation.</p><p>This week's question: How are firms approaching vaccine mandates for employees?</p><p>Please email responses to marc.vartabedian@wsj.com.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Material difference. The global auto industry is investing billions of dollars in chips made of silicon carbide, a more robust cousin of Silicon Valley's namesake element that companies believe can help them build high-performance electric vehicles, The Wall Street Journal's Yang Jie reports.</p><p>Silicon carbide, or SiC, is silicon married to carbon, the material in a diamond. Using it in chips that control power—as Tesla Inc. has done for several years—means less energy gets lost, which in turn leads to a more powerful motor that can drive farther on a single charge.</p><p>\"Customers of EVs are looking for greater range, and we see silicon carbide as an essential material in the design of our power electronics,\" said General Motors Co. Vice President Shilpan Amin this week after GM reached a deal to use silicon-carbide devices made by Durham, N.C.-based Wolfspeed Inc.</p><p>The big challenge now is ensuring that the battery cost savings achieved with silicon carbide chips outweigh the higher cost of making them. Industry observers say companies are making progress but remain years away from getting the cost close to silicon.</p><p>\"Ultimately, I anticipate it will be helpful to provide supervisory guidance for large banking institutions in their efforts to appropriately measure, monitor and manage material climate-related risks.\"</p><p>— Fed governor Lael Brainard said in virtual remarks at a conference on banking supervision</p><p>Network-Monitoring Firm Kentik Raises $40 Million in New Funding</p><p>Network-monitoring company Kentik Technologies Inc. said Thursday it raised $40 million in new funding as the recent Facebook Inc. outage highlights the need for businesses to monitor network performance, WSJ Pro's John McCormick reports. The company will use the funds to improve product functionality, increase its sales force and develop its network of partnerships, said Avi Freedman, Kentik's chief executive and co-founder. Kentik has raised $102 million since it was founded in 2014. It declined to discuss its valuation.</p><p>Investing Platform Public.com Launches Crypto Trading</p><p>The investing platform operated by Public Holdings Inc. is rolling out cryptocurrency trading, joining rivals such as Robinhood Markets Inc. in the digital-currency space, WSJ reports. The move marks an expansion for Public.com, which launched in 2019. Previously, individual investors who used the platform could trade only U.S.-listed stocks and exchange-traded funds. Unlike competitors including Robinhood, the company doesn't allow options or margin trading, two strategies considered more risky for investors.</p><p>Foundations, Private-Equity Firms Create ESG Reporting Platform</p><p>Major philanthropic foundations and private-equity firms have come together to form a centralized system for reporting on private companies' environmental, social and governance performance, WSJ Pro reports. The system, called Novata, aims to be a central database for gathering, reporting and benchmarking companies' performance on factors such as carbon emissions, resource management, employee diversity and workplace safety.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Share this email with a friend.</p><p>Forward ›</p><p>Forwarded this email by a friend?</p><p>Sign Up Here ›</p><p>Industry News</p><p>Funds</p><p>Fulcrum Global Capital, which is focused on disrupting the global food production industry, held the first close of its second fund with over $44 million committed, exceeding the size of its entire first fund by more than 20%.
