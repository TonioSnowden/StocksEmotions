  "text": "<p>\"David Manning was referred to me by an English friend as a client looking to purchase an apartment in New York City. I was a manager at the time, so I asked one of my brokers to take David out on a Sunday. It was a disaster. First thing Monday morning, I had the broker complaining that David was difficult, taking just two minutes to see an apartment. At the same time, I had a phone call from David, who was complaining that the broker had only scheduled six tours when he could quickly tour 20. So, I got involved. He asked me to see an apartment he had toured previously and to give him my opinion. That's when we first met. We then went to have a drink at Essex House and spent time talking about real estate. I felt something I never felt with anyone else, and I think it was mutual. David was calling me every day, and I started to understand it was more than just because of real estate. From our meeting on, we grew to appreciate each other's way of thinking, and my 12-year-old daughter told me, \"Mom, I think you're falling in love.\" We were married one year later and have been married for 27 years. David continues to be my most difficult client. When the time came to look for a house in the Hamptons, one that we would buy together, we looked at over 100 properties!\"</p><p>Jill Castle, managing broker for Premier Sotheby's International Realty in Charlotte and Lake Norman, N.C. </p><p>PHOTO: Federica Bordoni</p><p>\"Back when I was a real-estate agent, I was at the office one day, answering the phones, when I received a call from Barb, a small-business owner in upstate New York, who was relocating her company to my area and helping some of her employees relocate as well. We met for lunch on a hot and humid day in July, and she brought along another relocating employee named Kirk Castle, who wanted to purchase a home in the Charlotte area. I had no idea Barb had an ulterior motive. Kirk and I were both single, and during lunch it was as if Barb was not even there. A few months later, Kirk called to tell me he would be in my area and to see if we could meet for coffee to discuss real estate. We met and again talked nonstop. He never asked to see homes in North Carolina. Then he invited me for dinner. I still thought he just wanted to talk about buying a home, but I was wrong. Soon we were dating and, in 2008, we got married.\"</p><p>Jeff Kahn, broker-associate at ReMax Premier Realty in The Villages, Fla.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Have you ever developed a crush on your real-estate agent? Tell us the juicy details below.</p><p>\"I was contacted by a woman who was getting out of the military and planning a move from North Carolina to the Fort Lauderdale area. We communicated via Skype multiple times, so we knew what each other looked like, and I sent her information about several homes. I had her apply for mortgage preapproval, but she wasn't approved. Still, she wanted to come down and asked me to show her the area and some homes. When we were at lunch one day, and she steered the conversation to personal issues and then asked me if I could go to a club with her that night, I realized that her interest was in me, not real estate. Since I was married at the time, I had to let her down gently. But she kept calling me for days after that. After the fourth day, I had to tell her again that I was happily married and only interested in a business relationship. I never heard from her again.\"</p><p>â€”Edited from interviews by Robyn A.
