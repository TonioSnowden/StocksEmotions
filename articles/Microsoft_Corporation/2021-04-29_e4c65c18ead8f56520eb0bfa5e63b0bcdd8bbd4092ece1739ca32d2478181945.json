  "title": "New Enforcement Chief At SEC Abruptly Quits",
  "text": "<p>Ms. Oh was the first major hire announced by new Chairman Gary Gensler, who was sworn into his role on April 17. The enforcement director is the SEC's most high-profile staff job, managing a division of 1,300 people and fashioning a strategy for regulating Wall Street.</p><p>Ms. Oh decided to resign after U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, in an order issued Monday, questioned her conduct during a deposition in a lawsuit filed against Exxon Mobil. Ms. Oh's law firm, Paul Weiss, represents Exxon in the matter.</p><p>Mr. Gensler didn't comment on the reason for Ms. Oh's resignation in a statement issued Wednesday. \"I thank Alex for her willingness to serve the country at this important time,\" Mr. Gensler said.</p><p>Ms. Oh couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>The move represents an early stumble for Mr. Gensler, who was regarded as a tough regulator when he ran the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Obama administration. He has yet to announce any other new directors for the SEC's five main divisions.</p><p>The SEC didn't say Wednesday what Ms. Oh had disclosed to Mr. Gensler about the litigation dispute before she was hired. The plaintiffs in the Exxon litigation had alleged misconduct by Exxon's witness and Ms. Oh during a deposition that took place Feb. 14, according to court filings.</p><p>The lawsuit was filed by lawyers for 11 Indonesian citizens who alleged that Exxon's security personnel committed human-rights abuses in that country. The lawsuit is more than 20 years old.</p><p>The \"best practice\" for an attorney would be to \"disclose during the interview process and background check anything that could be potentially embarrassing to the agency,\" said Brad Bennett, a former head of enforcement for the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.</p><p>The SEC heard about Judge Lamberth's order after it was issued, and officials discussed it with Ms. Oh on Wednesday, according to a person familiar with the matter. Ms. Oh wrote in a resignation letter that she didn't want her work on the matter to become \"an unwelcome distraction\" to the SEC.</p><p>\"I deeply regret the disruption my brief appointment may cause,\" Ms. Oh wrote.</p><p>The deposition involved an Exxon lawyer based in Asia, who relied on a \"script\" to answer questions in an unresponsive fashion, the plaintiffs alleged. The conduct \"impeded, delayed and frustrated\" the ability of plaintiffs' lawyers to ask questions, they said.</p><p>The plaintiffs alleged that Exxon defense attorneys handling the lawsuit \"preplanned and actively assisted\" the strategy.</p><p>Judge Lamberth on Monday ordered Exxon to produce a witness who would answer under oath every question that he agreed was unresponsive. The judge also ordered Ms. Oh to explain why she shouldn't face sanctions for her conduct during the deposition.</p><p>Mr. Bennett said it isn't clear how the discovery dispute will end for Ms. Oh. Lawyers who are admonished by judges can petition the judge to reconsider the decision and even appeal the order to a federal appeals court.</p><p>\"I suspect we will hear much more about this down the road,\" Mr. Bennett said. \"It is not a done deal at all.\"</p><p>Ms. Oh, 53 years old, was to succeed Stephanie Avakian and Steven Peikin, who co-managed the Wall Street regulator's enforcement program from 2017 to 2020.</p><p>Ms. Oh, a graduate of Yale Law School, was a federal prosecutor in Manhattan earlier in her career, though only for about four years, according to her LinkedIn profile. SEC chiefs typically see the hiring of former prosecutors as sending a signal of a commitment to a strong enforcement program.</p><p>Brad Karp, chairman of Paul Weiss, said in an email that Ms. Oh \"is a person of the utmost integrity and a consummate professional, with a strong ethical code.\" He declined to comment on the lawsuit.</p><p>Ms. Oh has worked at Paul Weiss since October 2000 and was the latest example of a white-collar defense attorney returning to government to oversee enforcement. Some critics of that revolving door say it results in conventional thinking about how to handle investigations, while some lawyers say it allows talented litigators to temporarily lend their expertise to the public sector.</p>",
