  "title": "Cyber Daily: Security Teams Rush to Respond to The Log4j Vulnerability",
  "text": "<p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency sent out a warning on Friday, and alerts from technology companies followed throughout the weekend. Because hackers can easily exploit the flaw, corporate CISOs need to move fast. Security teams need to make sure they upgrade the Log4j software to get security fixes.</p><p>Cybersecurity researchers said the bug is one of the biggest risks in recent years because Log4j software is so common on corporate networks. Hackers could potentially exploit the vulnerability and access companies' sensitive data, then build back doors to maintain access to corporate servers even after security teams patch the flaw, experts warned. Read more from WSJ here.</p><p>The Health-ISAC, a nonprofit group that facilitates information-sharing about cyber threats among healthcare organizations, circulated a document on Friday that recommended companies identify any apps and services that rely on Log4j and block any outgoing traffic that isn't required. Many IT and security teams put in extended hours over the weekend, said Errol Weiss, chief security officer of the Health-ISAC. \"The major challenge here is quickly finding the vulnerable Log4j versions in your environment and mitigating them before the bad guys exploit it,\" he told me.</p><p>Security chiefs respond: Dawn Cappelli, CISO at Rockwell Automation, said an important step in making sure any corporate enterprise is safe is to evaluate security tools and confirm that firewall vendors and endpoint detection technology will actively block this attack. If a vendor hasn't contacted you to disclose which of their products are vulnerable, security teams should reach out to check their status, she said. \"If companies are not actively working on this they need to do so immediately – there is no time to waste,\" Ms. Cappelli said.</p><p>Richard Ford, CTO of cybersecurity company Praetorian said that patching all vulnerable code impacted by the flaw could take months.</p><p>Most developers don't have in-depth knowledge of how products are built, said Purandar Das, co-founder and president of cybersecurity firm Sotero. \"Third party vulnerability scans that are effective are critical to close this gap,\" he said.</p><p>What tech companies are saying: Microsoft's Minecraft advised users of its gaming software to upgrade. Amazon said it is monitoring the issue and \"working on addressing it for any AWS services which either use Log4j or provide it to customers as part of their service.\"</p><p>Worldwide alarm: Cybersecurity agencies in Europe sent out warnings about the Log4j vulnerability, including the U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre, which said scanning for the flaw was \"detected in the U.K. and exploitation detected elsewhere.\" France's cybersecurity agency sent a warning, and the German cyber agency circulated an alert and designated the vulnerability as a \"red\" warning, its highest category for extremely critical security flaws.</p><p>Explore Six Months of Threat Actor Innovation</p><p>The enormous upswing in innovation by threat actors isn't going away anytime soon. Check out our infographic for more details on landscape trends and attack activity from the first half of 2021.</p><p>View Infographic</p><p>Companies and governments around the world rushed over the weekend to fend off cyberattacks looking to exploit a serious flaw in a widely used piece of Internet software that security experts warn could give hackers sweeping access to networks.</p><p>Cybersecurity researchers said the bug, hidden in an obscure piece of server software called Log4j, represents one of the biggest risks seen in recent years because the code is so widely used on corporate networks.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued an urgent alert about the vulnerability and urged companies to take action. CISA Director Jen Easterly said on Saturday, \"To be clear, this vulnerability poses a severe risk. We will only minimize potential impacts through collaborative efforts between government and the private sector.\" Germany's cybersecurity organization over the weekend issued a \"red alert\" about the bug. Australia called the issue \"critical.\"</p><p>Security experts warned that it could take weeks or more to assess the extent of the damage and that hackers exploiting the vulnerability could access sensitive data on networks and install back doors they could use to maintain access to servers even after the flawed software has been patched.</p><p>\"It is one of the most significant vulnerabilities that I've seen in a long time,\" said Aaron Portnoy, principal scientist with the security firm Randori.</p><p>Read the full story.</p><p>More Cyber News</p><p>Volvo investigates hack and warns breach could affect operations. Swedish carmaker Volvo Car AB said it is investigating a breach targeting systems that research and development files. The company said it was contacted by an unnamed third party that stole the data. It isn't clear if the hackers are demanding a ransom from Volvo. Auto manufacturers are concerned about cybersecurity threats to the autonomous vehicles they are developing because hackers might be able to take control of a car, cause damage or even deaths. (WSJ)</p><p>What Volvo says: Volvo said in a statement that \"there may be an impact on the company's operation.\" It also said that the safety and security of customers' car or personal data shouldn't be affected, according to current information about the breach. \"After detecting the unauthorised access, the company immediately implemented security countermeasures including steps to prevent further access to its property and notified relevant authorities,\" the statement said. Volvo declined to elaborate about the breach.</p><p>Further reading: Auto-Sector Cybersecurity Group Expands to Europe Amid Rising Threats, New Regulation</p><p>India investigates hack of Prime Minister Modi's Twitter account. Indian officials are investigating a hack of the prime minister's Twitter account after a tweet was sent to his 73 million followers incorrectly saying India was adopting bitcoin as legal tender and distributing to to people in the country. The prime minister's office said on Twitter that the account was briefly compromised before it was secured. (WSJ)</p><p>White House gives agencies 24 hours to assess cyberattacks. A new National Security Council policy gives the FBI and other agencies a 24-hour deadline to deliver an assessment of certain cyberattacks to senior White House officials. Intelligence authorities would need to assess whether an attack \"rises to the level of a national security concern,\" CNN reports. The FBI, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence would make an initial analysis and assess whether a hack was motivated by sabotage or financial gain.</p><p>The NSC also wants the intelligence agencies to resume using a color code system, introduced during the Obama administration, to classify cyberattacks, designating low-impact hacks as green and emergency incidents as black. (CNN)</p><p>Saudi activist accuses U.S. intelligence contractors of hacking her phone. Activist Loujain al-Hathloul accused three former U.S. intelligence contractors of an illegal hack of her phone that led to her arrest and subsequent torture in Saudi Arabia, according to a lawsuit that the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed on her behalf in Oregon. Ms. al-Hathloul led a campaign to allow Saudi women to drive by livestreaming herself driving when it was illegal to do so. She has spent the past nearly three years in Saudi jails. The lawsuit cites a 2019 Reuters investigation that said Ms. al-Hathloul was targeted in 2017 by a group of U.S. contractors who conducted surveillance on behalf of the United Arab Emirates. Ms. al-Hathloul said interrogators who tortured her mentioned information they found through \"unlawful access\" to her phone.

Judges at the U.K. High Court ruled that diplomatic assurances from the U.S. stating that Mr. Assange wouldn't be held under the strictest maximum-security conditions were sufficient, clearing the path for him to be extradited. Lawyers representing Mr. Assange said they would appeal. In January, a judge refused his extradition, concluding that Mr. Assange would likely have attempted suicide if he were held in harsh conditions in a U.S. federal pentientiary. Mr. Assange is wanted in the U.S. on 18 charges of conspiring to disclose classified information and conspiring to hack a military computer. The allegations relate to WikiLeaks' 2010 and 2011 publications of classified material about the American involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. first sought his arrest in 2017.

Ireland's Health Service Executive published a report that it commissioned from PricewaterhouseCoopers into the May ransomware attack that crippled the country's hospitals, doctors' offices and healthcare services. Hackers used Conti ransomware and accessed the HSE's systems through a phishing email sent to an employee in March that contained a malicious Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. The HSE relied on an antivirus software that wasn't monitored or properly updated across the organization. The report recommended that the healthcare system hire a chief information security officer. (HSE)</p><p>Paul Reid, CEO of the HSE (pictured), said in a statement, \"We have initiated a range of immediate actions and we will now develop an implementation plan and business case for the investment to strengthen our resilience and responsiveness in this area.\"</p><p>Privacy News‎</p><p>Defense Department expected to name Defense Intelligence Agency as lead agency for open source intelligence. The move would give the DIA a leadership role in setting standards and determining policies for a category of unclassified data that was previously considered an afterthought. Information drawn from social media, online materials and commercial sources has become more important in military operations as digital devices and online databases have grown. At a Defense Department technology conference last week in Phoenix, DIA director Lr. Gen. Scott Berrier said the agency was expecting to receive a directive from Pentagon leaders very soon.</p><p>The action expected from the Defense Department doesn't address thorny policy issues about how much information should be able to obtain about citizens. DIA officials said at the Phoenix conference that about 80% of what is now in military intelligence reports is from unclassified sources. Processing and analytical power is now in short supply because the military is handling so much data.
