  "title": "Tuesday's Markets:  Tech, Growth Stocks Lead Way  ----  By Will Horner and Michael Wursthorn",
  "text": "<p>   Stocks rallied again and the Nasdaq Composite closed at a record as investors waded into shares of technology and other growth stocks. </p><p>   Most major stock sectors rose, extending the gains indexes enjoyed a day earlier. Shares of tech companies, though, appeared to get the most attention from investors. Stocks like Twitter, Netflix and Facebook soared, while Microsoft's market cap briefly rose above $2 trillion and Amazon.com came within striking distance of its first closing record since September. </p><p>   The gains came as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell continued to reiterate that the recent increase in inflation will likely prove temporary. Speaking before Congress, Mr. Powell said the central bank will wait for actual inflation to take root before raising interest rates. </p><p>   Any indications from the Fed that it won't move aggressively to raise interest rates have been hailed by investors. Many have taken it as a signal to resume buying tech and other growth stocks, which have been hard hit in recent months by the inflation fears. </p><p>   \"There's a realization that this is a really ripe environment and interest rates remain low,\" said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. \"The Fed is planning to be very accommodative to the economy over the next 24 months.\" </p><p>   Mr. Leary said investors' attention will likely shift to Friday's release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core personal-consumption-expenditures price index, for further insight into whether cost increases are truly transitory. </p><p>   \"We're likely to still see volatility around those types of prints,\" Mr. Leary added. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 rose 21.65 points, or 0.5%, to 4246.44, leaving the broad index 0.2% away from its June 14 record. The Nasdaq Composite closed at a record after gaining 111.79 points, or 0.8%, to 14253.27. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 68.61 points, or 0.2%, to 33945.58. </p><p>   Nine of the 11 major S&amp;P 500 sectors rose. The two laggards were real estate and utilities. </p><p>   Consumer discretionary stocks in the index were out front, gaining 1%. Tech and communication stocks were also strong, with Netflix adding $11.82, or 2.4%, to $508.82, Facebook gaining $6.74, or 2%, to $339.03 and Twitter rising $1.82, or 2.9%, to $63.78.. </p><p>   Other growth stocks also rallied, including Tesla,  $2.88, or 0.5%, to $623.71.;  Spotify, up $8.04, or 3.3%, to $253.64 and Zoom Video Communications, which added $5.40, or 1.5%, to $374.65. </p><p>   Helping the growth trade was a pullback in bond yields as prices rose. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged down to 1.471% from 1.481% on Monday. </p><p>   Other individual gainers included GameStop, whose shares rose $20.03, or 10%, to $220.40 after the videogame retailer said it had raised over $1 billion from the sale of shares. Meanwhile, Sanderson Farms added $17.20, or 10%, to $183.78 after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company is exploring a sale, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 index added 0.3%. </p><p>   Early Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was up 0.1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 1%. U.S. stock futures were down 0.3%. </p><p></p>",
