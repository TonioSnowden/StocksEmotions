  "title": "FTC Sues to Block Activision Deal  ---  Agency takes aim  at Microsoft's biggest  purchase ever on  competition grounds  ----  By Sarah E. Needleman in New York and Dave Michaels in Washington",
  "text": "<p>   The Federal Trade Commission Thursday sued Microsoft Corp. to block its planned $75 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard Inc., taking one of its biggest shots under the Biden administration at halting a merger of technology giants. </p><p>   The suit sets the stage for a court challenge over the deal as Microsoft agreed as part of negotiations with the \"Call of Duty\" publisher to defend the acquisition against a government lawsuit. </p><p>   The law enforcement agency said the deal is illegal because it would give Microsoft the ability to control how consumers beyond users of its own Xbox consoles and subscription services access Activision's games. The company could raise prices for people who don't use Microsoft's hardware to access the games, or even cut off access entirely, the FTC said. </p><p>   \"Microsoft has already shown that it can and will withhold content from its gaming rivals,\" said Holly Vedova, director of the FTC's bureau of competition, in a statement. \"Today we seek to stop Microsoft from gaining control over a leading independent game studio and using it to harm competition in multiple dynamic and fast-growing gaming markets.\" </p><p>   Microsoft said it continues to believe the deal, which it values at $68.7 billion after adjusting for Activision's net cash, would expand competition and signaled it plans to litigate with the federal agency. </p><p>   In its complaint, the FTC said Microsoft previously suppressed competition from rivals through its 2021 acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc., the owner of game developer Bethesda Softworks. The agency said Microsoft made several of Bethesda's games, including \"Starfield\" and \"Redfall,\" exclusive to its own platforms, despite giving assurances to European antitrust authorities that it would do otherwise. </p><p>   The commission vote was 3 to 1 in favor of authorizing the suit, with Republican Commissioner Christine S. Wilson voting against it. </p><p>   \"We have been committed since Day One to addressing competition concerns, including by offering earlier this week proposed concessions to the FTC,\" Brad Smith, Microsoft vice chair and president, said. \"While we believed in giving peace a chance, we have complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court.\" </p><p>   \"This is a somewhat meaningful setback for Microsoft,\" Stifel Nicolaus analyst Brad Reback said. \"Over the last two decades they've worked very hard to stay on the right side of government agencies.\" Mr. Reback added that if Microsoft litigates and loses, the company could become limited in its ability to do large deals in the future. </p><p>   Microsoft's deal for Activision, which would be its biggest-ever acquisition, also is under investigation by antitrust regulators in the U.K and the European Union. The companies first announced their merger agreement in January and said they expected the deal to close in June 2023. </p><p>   Microsoft makes Xbox videogame consoles and competes against Sony Group Corp. and Nintendo Co., which are known for their PlayStation and Switch consoles, respectively. All three companies also develop and publish their own games. </p><p>   \"The allegation that this deal is anti-competitive doesn't align with the facts, and we believe we'll win this challenge,\" said CEO Bobby Kotick in a letter to employees posted on Activision's website. </p><p>   The combined company would control about 11% of the global digital game publication business, according to Bloom-berg Intelligence analysts. </p><p>   The FTC initiated a review of the Activision deal in February, the Journal reported at the time. Since assuming office in 2021, Chairwoman Lina Khan has moved to investigate more mergers, particularly those involving the largest technology companies. </p><p>   Ms. Khan and other so-called progressive antitrust enforcers say competition law hasn't kept up with the evolution of the digital economy. Antitrust law historically focuses on whether mergers that combine competitors -- resulting in greater market concentration -- would likely drive up prices for consumers. Under the Biden administration, appointees such as Ms. Khan have pushed for focusing less on price effects and examining more vertical mergers, in which companies acquire key suppliers or partners and integrate them into their operations. </p><p>   Backers of the status quo say the courts have correctly focused on objective criteria such as price levels, reduced output or diminished opportunities for innovation. Vertical deals were historically thought to result in lower prices because companies could better control their input costs. </p><p>   Vertical deals are harder for the government to block, said Jennifer Rie, a senior litigation analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. The lawsuit also will be hard for the FTC to win because enforcers will have to show that withholding \"Call of Duty\" or similar games would be profitable for Microsoft, which pledged to allow rivals to continue accessing that blockbuster game. </p><p>   Ms. Khan \"is trying hard to develop case law that pushes things in a different direction than they have been going in the past 30 years, in which has been more and more difficult to challenge mergers,\" Ms. Rie said. \"This suit falls right into her wheelhouse in terms of what she's trying to do.\" </p><p>   Sony has been the loudest of the critics of the planned Activision deal, arguing that it could hurt competition if Microsoft restricts access to Activision games, especially \"Call of Duty,\" due to the franchise's exceptional popularity. </p><p>   The FTC's lawsuit defines one of the markets that might be impacted as games played on \"high-performance consoles,\" which it defines as just Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. </p><p>   Microsoft has repeatedly said it doesn't plan to deny Sony and others access to Activision games and that its deal for the company wouldn't hurt competition. The company has publicly pledged to give Sony and Nintendo access to new \"Call of Duty\" games on their respective current hardware the same day they launch on Xbox consoles for the next 10 years. </p><p>   The FTC's complaint, however, points out that Activision's library of games includes more hits than just \"Call of Duty\" and that consoles may not play as big a role in the future of videogaming as they do today. </p><p></p>",
