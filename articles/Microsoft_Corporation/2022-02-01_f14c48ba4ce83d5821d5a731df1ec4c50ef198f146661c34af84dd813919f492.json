  "text": "<p>Sony's announcement comes after Microsoft said in mid-January that it is buying videogame company Activision Blizzard Inc. in a deal valued at roughly $75 billion.</p><p>Microsoft also stands to gain one of the most popular shooter franchises, Activision's \"Call of Duty,\" one of the best-selling shooter series of all time, once those companies merge. A \"Call of Duty\" title has been the first or second best-selling game in the U.S. every year since 2010, according to market-research firm NPD Group.</p><p>Sony and Microsoft's planned acquisitions, which are pending regulatory approval, would give the console makers additional ways to compete against each other by adding more content to their portfolios that they could offer exclusively to customers.</p><p>\"Sony and Microsoft have been in a multiyear arms race of sorts for talent and developers,\" said Jefferies analyst Andrew Uerkwitz. \"Being at a critical juncture in the console cycle and on the cusp of bigger subscription services, first-party titles have never been more important.\"</p><p>After the deal closes, Bungie will be an independent subsidiary of Sony Interactive Entertainment and will continue to be run by its board chaired by Chief Executive Pete Parsons and Bungie's current management team, Sony said.</p><p>\"Bungie has created and continues to evolve some of the world's most beloved videogame franchises and, by aligning its values with people's desire to share gameplay experiences, they bring together millions of people around the world,\" said Sony Group Chairman and Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida.</p><p>Mr. Parsons said that the deal will help expand Bungie while preserving the studio's creative independence.</p><p>\"Today, Bungie begins our journey to become a global multimedia entertainment company,\" he said.</p><p>In 2000, Microsoft acquired Bungie to develop games for its then-forthcoming Xbox console. The studio found success in the early 2000s before it was split off from Microsoft in 2007. Microsoft's Xbox Game Studios has continued to produce new \"Halo\" games since then, and the company owns the intellectual property behind the franchise.</p><p>In 2010 Bungie, based in Bellevue, Wash., signed an exclusive 10-year publishing deal for its \"Destiny\" franchise with Activision. The tie-up ended a year early in 2019, with Activision saying the shooter series didn't meet its financial expectations.</p>",
