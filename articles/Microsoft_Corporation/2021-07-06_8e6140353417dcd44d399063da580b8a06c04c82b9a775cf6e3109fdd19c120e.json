  "title": "Antitrust Can Hurt U.S. Competitiveness  ----  By Robert D. Atkinson",
  "text": "<p>   When it comes to technology and the economy, the U.S. is grappling with two contradictory goals: competing with China in advanced technology industries and ramping up antitrust enforcement against leading U.S. tech companies. </p><p>   Antimonopoly advocates argue that we can have our cake and eat it too. Go ahead and break up big tech, they say; we can still compete with China. But there is a long history of U.S. antitrust actions against technology companies, and the results suggest regulators should exercise caution. </p><p>   Consider the case of Western Electric, AT&amp;T's equipment subsidiary. By the early 1920s, it had factories in Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Russia and the U.K. But because AT&amp;T relied on it exclusively for equipment, in 1925 the Justice Department threatened AT&amp;T with breakup unless it divested Western Electric's foreign assets, creating International Telephone &amp; Telegraph and ultimately giving birth to robust foreign-owned competitors. </p><p>   Antitrust regulators also pressured AT&amp;T's Bell Labs in the early 1950s to license its newly invented transistor technology. That spurred innovation because it helped emerging companies such as Texas Instruments and Fairchild. But because of government pressure, AT&amp;T also licensed its technology, almost for free, to foreign companies. This eventually enabled Sony to take global leadership from the U.S. in consumer electronics, and it gave a major leg up to Europe's Ericsson and Siemens. </p><p>   The U.S. also used to be the global leader in television technology thanks to the Radio Corp. of America, the pathbreaker in color television. But in the 1950s the Justice Department required RCA to let other U.S. companies use its patents at no charge. RCA had long relied on licensing revenue, so it started making money where it could -- in Japan. \"RCA licenses made Japanese color television possible,\" technology historian James Abegglen has written. </p><p>   In 1972, the Federal Trade Commission brought a similar antitrust suit against Xerox, the world's then-leading producer of copier technology thanks in part to its Silicon Valley-based innovation incubator Xerox PARC. Evidently unimpressed, the head of the FTC's Bureau of Competition F.M. Scherer said he would be \"dissatisfied if Xerox's market share isn't significantly diminished in several years.\" To that end, the FTC forced Xerox to give up its blueprints and other discoveries, allowing an estimated 1,700 patents to make their way to Xerox competitors. Sure enough, Xerox lost half its market share -- mostly to Japanese firms such as Canon, Toshiba and Sharp. Xerox's only viable path to survival was to strengthen its alliance with Fuji, creating a new giant, Fuji Xerox. </p><p>   Two years later in 1974, the Justice Department targeted AT&amp;T again, forcing it to break up over the objections of Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldridge that the suit jeopardized America's leadership position. This was the death knell for Bell Labs, arguably the most innovative organization that has ever existed. </p><p>   None of this is to say that antitrust authorities should be passive or turn a blind eye to anticompetitive behavior. But they should recognize that firms' size can be an important factor in their ability to innovate. Rather than rely on market share as the alarm bell that signals the need for antitrust enforcement, regulators should focus more on firms' conduct, and they should look first to behavioral remedies, not structural ones. Antitrust analysis should also consider that tech companies compete globally, not nationally, so cutting them down to size usually has significant economic consequences. </p><p>   The Federal Communications Commission has provided a model for the behavioral approach by conducting a series of inquiries starting in 1970 to investigate the convergence of telephone and computing services and establish rules enabling competition among established and upstart players across sectors that are increasingly intertwined. U.S. courts also provided a model in judgments against Microsoft, which compelled it to let other companies more easily integrate their software into Windows. </p><p>   As policy makers now consider competition issues related to today's large technology firms, they would be well advised to learn from this history. With Chinese internet and tech companies waiting in the wings, aggressive antitrust actions against U.S. leaders run the risk of giving a new generation of foreign rivals the boost they need to dominate global markets, just as Japanese and European firms have benefited in the past. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Atkinson is president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. </p><p></p>",
