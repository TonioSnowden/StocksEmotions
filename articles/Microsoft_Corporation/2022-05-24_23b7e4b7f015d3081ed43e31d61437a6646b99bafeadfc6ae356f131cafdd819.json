  "text": "<p>Mr. Bacon hunted for a customer help line or an email address and learned what many others before him have discovered: There are none. \"I have never been able to speak to a human,\" he said of what turned out to be a monthslong quest to restore his Facebook account.</p><p>Users of the free services in the empire of Meta Platforms Inc., which includes WhatsApp, sometimes go to great and unusual lengths to get help. Few succeed.</p><p>Customer service at TikTok and Twitter is about the same.</p><p>Mr. Bacon said he patiently followed Facebook's instructions. He changed his password, twice, and provided identification. Nothing happened. Then he pleaded help from a higher power. He sent a certified letter to Sheryl Sandberg, Meta's chief operating officer, at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. He described failed efforts to resurrect his Facebook page.</p><p>\"No path exists for me to address the issue,\" Mr. Bacon wrote. He signed the letter, with warm regards. Ms. Sandberg didn't write back.</p><p>Meta spokesman Joe Osborne declined to comment on specific user experiences but acknowledged that losing an account can be distressing and that the company needs to improve. Some Meta customers have been temporarily shut out of their accounts following decisions by the social media giant's algorithms, or human moderators for reasons that users often find baffling.</p><p>More recently, people said in interviews that, like Mr. Bacon, their Facebook accounts were disabled after they got hacked. They also said getting help was impossible.</p><p>Some frustrated users have turned to IT charlatans who tout their expertise in restoring Facebook accounts. Hundreds of dollars later, users say it was money wasted. A woman in a widely viewed video of a podcast posted on Twitter last week claimed she slept with several Instagram employees to get her account back. Mr. Osborne declined to comment on the incident.</p><p>Other people have sent messages begging for assistance from random Facebook or Instagram employees and executives via LinkedIn.</p><p>Facebook locked Amber O'Sullivan's mom out of her account this year. Ms. O'Sullivan turned to LinkedIn and messaged nearly two dozen Facebook employees in Ireland, where the family lives.</p><p>\"Thierry\" responded, Ms. O'Sullivan said. He steered her to a news story about a live chat function Facebook was testing but didn't say how to find it. Her mom's account was later unlocked without explanation.</p><p>In March, Facebook introduced Facebook Protect, which it said added another layer of security to some accounts. Some users said the new feature instead blocked them from accessing Facebook. Thousands turned to JustAnswer, a website that connects people with experts in various industries.</p><p>Soon after Facebook Protect was rolled out, JustAnswer said Facebook-related inquiries jumped 88% in a week. The site gets an average of about 3,000 questions a day regarding Facebook and Instagram troubles.</p><p>\"People are overwhelmed, and they don't understand what's happened,\" said Cris Angulo, a tech expert at JustAnswer. \"They just want to hear someone's voice. Sometimes they think we are Facebook.\"</p><p>When Mr. Angulo and his colleagues can't solve a problem, they steer people back to Facebook's online directions.</p><p>Meta hasn't expanded its customer service to accommodate its billions of users because of the enormous scale and expense of the undertaking, according to people familiar with the company. It also has viewed a call center as its own security risk, a potential path for bad actors to gain access to accounts for criminal or other nefarious purposes.</p><p>The company said it has made some customer-service investments, including testing a live-chat option for some users locked out of their accounts, and it also fixed software bugs that had made it hard for people to regain access.</p><p>Facebook and Instagram employees said they used to have an internal process for getting help. That avenue is now largely closed, some of them said.</p><p>When The Wall Street Journal wrote about Facebook's confusing platform rules last year, a Facebook spokeswoman said the company planned to \"build out better customer support.\" In December, the company began what it said was a small test of its live online chat function.</p><p>A recent job posting for head of customer support operations at Meta said addressing customer service was \"a complex problem, and we are just 1% finished.\"</p><p>One idea that spread last year on Reddit and Quora involved buying a roughly $300 Oculus virtual-reality headset. Oculus, which is owned by Meta, has a dedicated customer-service line for the devices.</p><p>Mr. Bacon said he learned about it from his wife, who heard something on National Public Radio. After his letter to Ms. Sandberg went unanswered, Mr. Bacon in December bought one of the headsets, which have been rebranded as Meta Quest.</p><p>Two hours after speaking with someone in Oculus customer service, his Facebook account was restored. The headset, having done its work, is also retired. Mr. Bacon said it was now \"sitting casually on our TV stand.\"</p><p>(See related letters: \"Letters to the Editor: At Facebook, You Are the Product, Not the Customer\" -- WSJ June 4, 2022)</p>",
