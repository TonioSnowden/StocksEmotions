  "title": "Heard on the Street:  Snowflake Sees Sun  A Long Way Out  ----  By Dan Gallagher",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  For all the criticism about Wall Street's short-term focus, sometimes investors do manage to think in the very long term. </p><p>\n  Take Snowflake: Since going public in September, the provider of cloud-based data analytics tools has managed an epic valuation. Even with a 13% drop since the start of the year, Snowflake trades at around 57 times forward sales -- the richest multiple in the richly valued cloud sector. At the stock's peak in December, Snowflake commanded a market value of just over $110 billion. That was on par with IBM, an admittedly struggling tech giant still generating more than 100 times Snowflake's annual revenue. </p><p>\n  Investors therefore clearly expect that Snowflake can scale up significantly in the coming years. And years it will take, even with the triple-digit growth the company has been managing so far. Hence, Snowflake used its first analyst meeting on Thursday to give a very long-term view. The company projects it will hit $10 billion in product revenue in its 2029 fiscal year. That will require averaging a little over 40% growth annually over the next eight fiscal years, which David Hynes of Canaccord says would make Snowflake \"the fastest ever software company to reach that level of scale.\" </p><p>\n  It also was already baked into the numbers. The few analysts willing to project that far had already reached a consensus of $10.9 billion in product revenue for fiscal 2029, according to Visible Alpha. </p><p>\n  The company's projection of reaching operating margins of about 10% on an adjusted basis by that time also was deemed a bit of a letdown -- though some analysts believe the company was likely being overly conservative. Snowflake's share price still slipped more than 3% Friday, though it gained back some of that ground Monday. </p><p>\n  Few disagree that Snowflake has a large opportunity ahead. The company's data-warehousing software is in hot demand by enterprises looking to speed up their business analytics abilities. And the fact that it works across all the major cloud platforms helps in a world where more companies are electing not to go all in on just one. </p><p>\n  Still, Snowflake has less visibility into its future results than many other cloud software providers. The company generates revenue as customers use its service, as opposed to subscriptions that are collected up front. But no analyst seems to think Snowflake will have trouble hitting its long-term goal. Karl Keirstead of UBS notes that Amazon's AWS cloud business and Microsoft's Azure were both generating 70% growth rates when at the $10 billion a year mark. If Snowflake manages that, those paying up for the shares now will be getting a bargain. They just need patience to find out. </p><p></p>",
