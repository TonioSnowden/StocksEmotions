  "text": "<p>Videos of businesswomen and female politicians dancing, drinking and living it up have flooded social media, accompanied by the hashtag #SolidarityWithSanna.</p><p>\"If letting off steam at a party is the worst that your prime minister has done, then you're a pretty lucky country,\" tweeted Fiona Patten, an Australian politician, alongside a photograph of her dancing in the street. As of Tuesday, her post had been liked over 2,500 times.</p><p>\"I'm a female elected politician and of course I party and dance!\" posted Brenda Bailey, a Canadian politician and tech entrepreneur from Vancouver, atop a Facebook post of her dancing at a concert.</p><p>At a recent press conference, Ms. Marin said that the footage was taken during her time off and that nothing illegal took place. She has since taken a drug test to quell accusations of wrongdoing. The test was confirmed negative on Monday, according to a statement from her office.</p><p>\"She did it with bravery, and she went for it because she knew she had nothing to hide,\" said Luise Ammerschuber, the director of consulting company YESS Impact, speaking of the drug testing. Ms. Ammerschuber, who is based in Switzerland, also posted a photograph of herself dancing in the street on LinkedIn.</p><p>Many of the supportive posts have pointed to the role of gender and sexism in the backlash, questioning whether a male politician would have received such scrutiny.</p><p>\"How is a woman criticized for doing something almost every human being enjoys?\" said Nina Hupen-Bestendonk, a Berlin-based content creator who posted a video of herself and seven friends doing a choreographed dance routine on rollerblades. \"I don't want to live in a Europe where a female president can't dance at a private party, while also successfully running her country.\"</p><p>The criticism—and near-immediate support—of Ms. Marin echoes the blowback seen when U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) was slammed by critics for a video of her dancing in college. After the video began circulating online, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez posted a new video of her dancing outside her office in Washington, D.C.</p><p>This isn't the first time Ms. Marin has been criticized for partying, albeit under different circumstances. Late last year, the Finnish leader was blasted for going to a club in Helsinki hours after her foreign minister tested positive for Covid-19. According to Ms. Marin, the quarantine guidance she received on her personal phone and work phone differed: while her secretary told the minister she didn't need to be quarantined, instructions on her work phone, which she didn't see until the next day, advised her to avoid contacting others.</p><p>After joining the youth wing of Finland's Social Democratic Party in 2006, Ms. Marin had a quick rise to power, becoming the country's youngest ever leader in 2019 at the age of 34.</p><p>The media storm surrounding the videos comes at a tense time for the small Scandinavian nation. In May, with the nearby war in Ukraine raging, Finland and its neighbor Sweden applied for membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Finland shares a roughly 830-mile border with Russia.</p><p>For Mirjam Rollinger, a geodata analyst who choreographed the rollerblade dance in Berlin, the criticism around Ms. Marin is symbolic of a larger issue, including pushback against women being seen letting their hair down in public.</p><p>\"It makes me angry that sometimes, my freedom is judged: my freedom of expressing my joy of dancing, my joy of living, my joy of feeling well in my own body, even within a group,\" she said. \"When Sanna Marin was judged for dancing with her friends, I felt that same anger.\"</p><p>Write to Elissa Miolene at Elissa.Miolene@wsj.com</p><p>Businesswomen and Politicians Show #SolidarityWithSanna, the Partying Prime Minister</p>",
