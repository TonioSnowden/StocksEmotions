  "text": "<p>FARGO, N. D.—Here on the edge of the Great Plains, city leaders have been working to revitalize their downtown by tearing up one parking lot at a time.</p><p>For years, though, people didn't want to give up their parking lots.</p><p>Like many downtowns, Fargo had to adapt in the 20th century to a car-based economy, and one easy way to add parking was to tear down buildings. By the 2000s, when Tim Mahoney, a local surgeon, joined the Fargo City Commission, the city's archipelago of lots was becoming a drag on the economy, generating little in parking or tax revenue.</p><p>Still, people thought downtown didn't have enough parking, so there was little motivation to get rid of the lots.</p><p>\"When people come downtown, it's always, 'Parking, parking, parking; Tim, there's no parking,'\" said Mr. Mahoney, now mayor of Fargo.</p><p>With pointers from other cities and a new financing structure, the city has figured out how to add parking while not saddling taxpayers with debt.</p><p>In their biggest venture, the city and several partners joined forces on a $110 million project to transform a dreary surface lot ​and neglected public area covering nearly an entire city block in the heart of downtown. Now an 18-story glass-and-concrete building towers over the four- and five-story brick apartments and storefronts across the street. The complex has a boutique hotel, office space, condos and a public area called Broadway Square with dancing fountains, a farmers market, movie nights, concerts, winter ice skating—and a parking deck.</p><p>City officials, residents and business leaders say the project, completed in 2020, has attracted three ice cream shops, apartments, restaurants and retailers to a downtown long dominated by dive bars and the giant illuminated sign on the art deco Fargo Theatre.</p><p>\"It used to be downtown Fargo was where people go to get drunk,\" said Angel Kordovsky, a 30-year-old nurse, as she and her partner sipped cocktails at the Jasper Hotel's Rosewild Bar. \"Now, it's like, let's go have a nice supper—and maybe a nice drink.\"</p><p>The complex includes the second-tallest building in North Dakota, Mr. Mahoney said. \"When we first toured the building, we joked to the group, 'Hey, I can see the Capitol in Bismarck,'\" he said. The Capitol is the state's tallest building, but it is 200 miles away.</p><p>The city of 126,000 has been growing since the 1990s, adding 10,000 residents since 2010.</p><p>As North Dakota's largest city, Fargo draws area talent as well as transplanted professionals in agriculture, healthcare, education and technology who are looking for a low cost of living and short commutes, the mayor said. The manufacturing sector got a boost from supplying pipes and tankers as the fracking industry took off on the other side of the state. Mr. Mahoney notes that since 2005, the total assessed value of downtown properties has grown to $1.3 billion from $150 million.</p><p>In the fall of 2014, city leaders were still trying to figure out their parking conundrum when they visited Lincoln, Neb., which had developed a number of parking garages as part of its master plan, Mr. Mahoney said. It was the first time leaders saw that a parking ramp could be built to look more like an apartment complex or a retail area, he said. And they glimpsed how new garages could be developed through public-private partnerships.</p><p>The city since has built three new projects that include shops, apartments and offices, along with parking financed by a special taxing structure called tax-increment financing, which dedicates the equivalent of new taxes generated by the projects to fund the parking structures.</p><p>\"We saw it as an economic engine as you had to have an ability for people to have parking close to their business,\" Mr. Mahoney said. </p><p>Michelle Pulling, owner of The Silver Lining Creamery, says the Fargo projects built atop old parking lots have injected buzz to the city's downtown.

Mr. Burgum, now the Republican governor of North Dakota, was an entrepreneur who had sold his company to Microsoft Corp. before starting a development firm called Kilbourne Group. The company specializes in historical redevelopment and infill projects, often converting parking lots into mixed-use projects.</p><p>\"It looked really cool. But a lot of people in the room were like, 'That'll never happen,'\" Mr. Mahoney said.</p><p>But the developers went to work on a design and eventually attracted R.D. Offutt, a company with about 350 employees that owns John Deere dealerships, farms and other agricultural businesses, as the main tenant, said Mike Allmendinger, president of Kilbourne Group.</p><p>In its agreement with the developers, the city worked to limit its risk—and its financial commitment to $15 million of the $110 million cost of the project. \"We didn't want to look like idiots if it all fell apart,\" Mr. Mahoney said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What has your city done to create fun spaces? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Michelle Pulling, owner of an ice cream shop called The Silver Lining Creamery across the street from Broadway Square, knew the potential of what was coming to Fargo because she had seen it in Rapid City, S.D.</p><p>She had owned a coffee shop there, which about a dozen years ago hosted meetings of people opposed to a city plan to turn a parking lot into a space similar to the Fargo square. \"'We need the parking,' people said, they couldn't envision it,\" she said. \"It was a big upheaval, ya know, and now everybody says it's the best thing that's happened to downtown.\"</p><p>When her daughter in Fargo told her that the city was planning something similar, Ms. Pulling decided to leave her son in charge of her ice cream shop in Rapid City, and she opened the new one in Fargo.</p><p>\"This one is really amazing,\" she said of Broadway Square. \"You can come on a weekend at 11 o'clock at night and it's packed with people. There's little food carts on the corners. Downtown Fargo in the summertime is really crazy.\"</p><p>Write to Joe Barrett at joseph.barrett@wsj.com</p><p>Fargo Forges New Downtown Out of Old Parking Lots</p>",
