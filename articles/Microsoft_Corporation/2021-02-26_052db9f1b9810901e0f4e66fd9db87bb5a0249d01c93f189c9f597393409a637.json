Even if all emissions were zero tomorrow, heating, droughts, floods, storms and rising sea levels will just continue.</p> <p>The first assignment in climate policy is to do everything that contributes to lowering the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere: global cooling. That is what trees, forests, mangroves, seagrass lands, oceans and soils do.</p> <p>Stopping Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro from destroying the Amazon rainforest should be at the top of the global climate agenda, “whatever it takes”.</p> <p><strong>Wouter Veening</strong><br><em>President, Institute for Environmental Security, The Hague, The Netherlands</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Gates has fallen into the zero emissions trap' FT.com 26 February.
