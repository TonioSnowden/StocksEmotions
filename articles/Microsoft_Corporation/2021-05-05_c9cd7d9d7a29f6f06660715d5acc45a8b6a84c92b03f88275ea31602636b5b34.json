  "title": "Wealth Management (A Special Report) --- Young Investors Flock to Live Chat Rooms For Financial Advice: They are quicker than message boards and more engaging than prerecorded videos",
  "text": "<p>Chat startups such as Discord Inc. and Telegram Messenger Inc. are drawing users looking for faster-paced, real-time conversations with other investors as they follow market trends or seek investment advice. Conversations often begin with a user posting a general question about a stock, or announcing they are buying or selling a stock. Fellow members of the group, discussion-group leaders or other staff then respond. Conversations tend to run quicker than message-board exchanges, are more private and can be more engaging than prerecorded videos. Discord servers, for example, use invitation links and can't be searched and found as easily as the communities on Reddit.</p><p>Discord got its start in 2015 as a messaging service for gamers, but has since tapped into a wider audience of people with shared interests, including music, technology and, now, investing. The company, which says it has more than 140 million active users, recently attracted suitors including Microsoft Corp. Discord has ended those talks and is considering an initial stock offering.</p><p>While Discord offers its chat service free, some users of the investing-themed communities on its platform gain access to their groups through subscription fees paid via third-party payment services that Discord doesn't control. Such fees typically range from around $20 to $100 a month. Subscription fees also buy perks such as trading alerts and opportunities to follow and get tips from traders affiliated with the community who give advice on how to execute a trade and their thoughts on certain stocks. On Telegram, meanwhile, people also talk about stocks on user-run channels. Some channels charge fees to follow trades or get alerts on things like moves in the foreign-exchange market.</p><p>Clubhouse Software Inc., a live audio chat-room app, has many rooms dedicated to investing, but for now no fees are involved. People who run these conversations are trying to build up followers that may eventually enable them to get paid for their advice on the app.</p><p>Telegram and Clubhouse didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>\"Finance is one of the many topics that has been rising in popularity on the service,\" a spokesperson for Discord says. \"We are always excited to see the creative and unconventional ways people are using Discord, and this includes the broad variety of personal-finance discussions, from investment clubs and day traders to college students and professional financial advisers.\"</p><p>In January, Discord ranked No. 2 behind Facebook for average minutes spent by adult U.S. users on social-media networks, according to Verto Analytics.</p><p>Many investing-focused communities using Telegram and Discord post disclaimers saying they are not registered investment advisers and aren't qualified to give financial advice.</p><p>One community that uses Discord, Next Gen Investors, with more than 4,000 members, focuses on high-risk options trading and charges $26 a month to follow community leaders such as 25-year-old Tyrell Dukes. Mr. Dukes studied financial management in college and is one of four men in their 20s who founded and run Next Gen Investors.</p><p>Mr. Dukes says he and his colleagues don't make trading recommendations; instead, he says, community members are paying to receive alerts about the leaders' investing plays as well as basic explanations about options trading.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Holger is a reporter for The Wall Street Journal in Barcelona.
