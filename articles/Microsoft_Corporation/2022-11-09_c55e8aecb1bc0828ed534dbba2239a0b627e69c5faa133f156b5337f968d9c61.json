  "title": "Zuck Didn't Move Fast, Still Broke Things; Meta Platforms' blowout hiring was only part of Facebook parent's problems, as investors still aren't buying into Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse plans",
  "text": "<p>But 11,000 workers is also about 4,000 fewer than the number that Meta has hired just since the start of this year, when some problems already were apparent. One is that the company's core advertising business was slipping, hurt by a combination of factors including a slowing economy, competition from TikTok and changes by Apple that Facebook refers to as \"signal loss\"—meaning less ability to track the activity of users for the purpose of selling them targeted ads. In early February, Meta reported that ad revenue grew only 20% year over year during the fourth quarter—10 points below what it had averaged over the previous eight periods—and its first ever decline in daily active users. The news cost the company more than one-quarter of its market value the following day.</p><p>Another thing apparent early on was that investors were taking a pretty dim view of Mr. Zuckerberg's plan to transform Facebook into a \"metaverse\" company. The move, which included the company's renaming, was announced in late October last year. Six months later, Meta's share price already was down by 34%—more than double the 15% drop averaged by big tech peers Microsoft, Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet over the same span.</p><p>Meta's stock jumped nearly 8% Wednesday morning on the layoff news, but investors cheering the belated attention to cost control should still be wary. Its business ultimately still relies on users of its Facebook and Instagram apps checking in every day, and that future is far from certain as new time drains like TikTok take hold. Facebook in particular also still faces substantial questions about privacy, security and political disinformation on the platform.</p><p>The company wasn't terribly inefficient before the recent cuts either. Meta was generating about $1.35 million in annual revenue per employee as of the end of the third quarter, putting it in the upper fifth of the S&amp;P 500 and in fifth place among tech companies on the index, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>In his letter Wednesday, Mr. Zuckerberg took responsibility for his failure to curb the company's costs earlier. But the 38-year-old billionaire remains hot on the metaverse, and only vaguely hinted that he might consider reducing the company's blowout capital spending meant to fuel that vision. And while some shareholders might remain unhappy with the new direction, they have little actual recourse. Even in its new form, the old Facebook remains a controlled company through its co-founder's supervoting stake. For better or worse, Mr. Zuckerberg's job is fully secure.</p><p>Zuck Didn't Move Fast, Still Broke Things</p>",
