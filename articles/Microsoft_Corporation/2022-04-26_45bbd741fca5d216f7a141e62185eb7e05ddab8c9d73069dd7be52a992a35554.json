  "text": "<p>    Activision Blizzard Inc.'s first-quarter sales and profit plunged as demand for its \"Call of Duty\" videogame franchise fell. </p><p>   The videogame company, which in January agreed to be purchased by Microsoft Corp. for $75 billion, posted a 22% drop in sales from a year ago, reflecting weaker premium sales for \"Call of Duty: Vanguard,\" the latest installment in the popular franchise, as well as lower engagement with \"Call of Duty: Warzone,\" a free-to-play title. </p><p>   Microsoft agreed to buy the videogame developer for $95 a share in an effort to expand its catalog of blockbuster videogames and drive more customers to its cloud-gaming service. </p><p>   Microsoft valued the deal at nearly $69 billion after adjusting for Activision's net cash. The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies and would make Microsoft the world's third-largest game company by sales. </p><p>   For the quarter ended March 31, Activision posted a profit of $395 million, down from $619 million in the year-earlier quarter. </p><p>   In addition to tepid demand for its \"Call of Duty\" game titles, Activision said it took a hit due to the product cycle timing for its \"Warcraft\" franchise, along with increased legal fees and other costs associated with the Microsoft acquisition. </p><p>   Excluding one-time items, adjusted earnings for the quarter fell to 64 cents a share, down from 98 cents in 2021. </p><p>   Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting earnings of 71 cents a share. </p><p>   Sales were $1.77 billion in the quarter, short of analysts' expectations of $1.82 billion. </p><p>   The acquisition is slated to close in mid-2023. </p><p>   Microsoft announced plans to acquire Activision as the company was being roiled by claims of workplace misconduct. </p><p>   Activision's chief executive, Bobby Kotick, had known about various sexual-misconduct accusations for years, The Wall Street Journal previously reported, though he didn't inform the board about everything he knew. The issues prompted lawsuits and federal investigations. </p><p>   Mr. Kotick has said he has been transparent with the company's board, and Activision has called the Journal's reporting \"misleading.\" </p><p>   Last week, the company said it plans to add two women to its board of directors. </p><p></p>",
