  "text": "<p>Law firm Latham &amp; Watkins has hired former Federal Trade Commission bureau director and ex-Kirkland &amp; Ellis partner Ian Conner, marking the latest departure of a government lawyer in the wake of the US election. </p> <p>Litigator and antitrust partner Conner will join Latham's Washington office after three and a half years working in the FTC as director of the bureau of competition under the Trump administration, according to the firm. </p> <p>The lawyer began his career in the US Department of Justice and worked on the FTC's high-profile case against Facebook for allegedly abusing its monopoly power. </p> <p>His hiring comes as the world's largest internet giants face a global fightback from antitrust agencies around the world, resulting in growing demand at the world's top law firms for competition experts.</p> <p>Conner resigned in January alongside former FTC chair Joseph Simons and a series of senior staff members. He was one of a large network of lawyers from Kirkland &amp; Ellis — the highest grossing law firm in the world — to be appointed to government roles during the Trump administration.</p> <p>Those included former attorney-general William Barr — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0728920b-3e57-4e76-a58b-dcfc468a3ff3\">who resigned</a> in December — and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf1ea988-ca2d-439a-8193-bc3c6d0da16e\">Jeffrey Clark</a>, former acting head of the US justice department's civil division. Clark was among those involved in Trump's attempt to overturn the election last year, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/us/politics/jeffrey-clark-trump-election.html\">New York Times report</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4430163/Ian-R-Conner-Financial-Disclosure.pdf\">Financial disclosures</a> revealed that Conner earned more than $1m a year in salary at Kirkland as well as an expected bonus ranging from $250,000 to $500,000. </p> <p>Latham, whose equity partners took home $3.8m on average in 2019 according to Statista, said Conner would advise multinational clients on mergers and antitrust issues including the regulation of big tech.&#xa0;The firm is advising Nvidia <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3adccc9-678e-44ef-bdb5-e847ecb7de8c\">following</a> its $40bn takeover of Arm, and other clients include Facebook and American Airlines. </p> <p>During Conner's tenure, the FTC, along with 46 US states, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c03ac0f-7122-4c31-97a5-ecab3928a038\">brought antitrust cases</a> against Facebook, accusing the social media giant of using its dominance to stamp out competition.&#xa0;</p> <p>The FTC accused Facebook of conducting a “years-long course of anti-competitive conduct” including strategically buying up rivals that threatened its monopoly power.&#xa0;</p> <p>Google has also been targeted by antitrust lawsuits in the US and Europe, while the UK Competition and Markets Authority told the Financial Times it was planning a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da5c30a8-6fab-4131-b6bd-f8f05dcf5a46\">series of probes</a> against tech giants during the next 12 months.&#xa0;</p> <p>Amanda Reeves, global chair of Latham's antitrust and competition practice, noted: “The last few years have seen a notable uptick in activity among competition agencies around the world.”</p> <p>In a statement posted to LinkedIn following his resignation in January, Conner said the FTC had brought 18 merger challenge complaints, settled 37 merger challenges and brought 10 complaints challenging monopolisation and anti-competitive conduct during his tenure. </p> <p>He noted that the work had been completed in spite of two government shutdowns and a global pandemic.<br></p><p>Source: Kate Beioley in London  2021 'Former FTC competition director joins Latham &amp; Watkins ' FT.com 1 March.
