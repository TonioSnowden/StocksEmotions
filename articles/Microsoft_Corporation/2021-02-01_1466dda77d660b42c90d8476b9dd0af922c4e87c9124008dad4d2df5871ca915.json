  "title": "Fundamentals Count Even for GameStop",
  "text": "<p>That business closed its fiscal year on Saturday -- wrapping up what is expected to be its second straight year of double-digit revenue declines. That business has completely decoupled from a stock that shot up as much as 25-fold in just the past three weeks. The shares have taken on a life of their own, serving as a \"meme stock\" driving a class war between individual investors and Wall Street.</p><p>At some point -- someday -- the company's fundamentals will matter again. Those fundamentals show a retail chain of more than 5,000 stores struggling to stay relevant. But the company made some deft moves lately, and the game business still involves hardware and other products that can't be downloaded. With the help of new Xbox and PlayStation consoles that launched in November and remain very hard to find -- due to high demand and supply constraints -- the current year will be a crucial one for GameStop to show it can revamp its business.</p><p>But what exactly that business will look like remains a big question. Historically, GameStop generated the biggest portion of its profits through the sale of preowned game hardware and software. But games sold as digital downloads don't generate used sales down the road. Publishers such as Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard note that more than half the sales of their most popular games are taking place digitally. Indeed, GameStop stopped disclosing sales and profit data of preowned games in its 2018 fiscal year -- after sales fell for four straight years.</p><p>GameStop 's current push is to become an omnichannel retailer, selling goods and services online and in person. Ryan Cohen , co-founder of online pet-food retailer Chewy, bought up a major stake in GameStop last year and began agitating for the company to push further into e-commerce. The company named Mr. Cohen and two of his associates to its board of directors on Jan. 11 -- a move that helped to trigger the frenzy in the stock.</p><p>Such a strategy will take time to play out and is hardly assured. Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird says a best-case scenario, where GameStop becomes a \"majority-digital retailer,\" will still involve it closing more than half its store base while preserving its share of the videogame market. In a note to clients Thursday, he said GameStop 's shares would be worth $125 under such a \"Bright blue sky scenario\" -- about 63% below the stock's current price. He assigns a 5% probability to that outcome.</p><p>Most likely, says Mr. Sebastian, is his \"grey-sky scenario\" in which GameStop benefits from the new console generation but is still closing stores while slowly rolling out new digital services. That underpins his $13 price target on the stock -- roughly in line with the median of price targets from other analysts covering the company. Those targets might look quaint now, but business fundamentals have a way of lasting. Memes don't.</p>",
