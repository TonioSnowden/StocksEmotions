  "title": "GOP Inches Closer to Expected Narrow House Majority, With Senate Still a Tossup; Control of Congress might not be known for days as several races remain in flux",
  "text": "<p>How People Voted</p><p>Results of survey of about 115,000 registered voters</p><p>Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly was running just under 6 percentage points ahead of his opponent, Blake Masters, in Arizona, and Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto was just over 1 percentage point behind challenger Adam Laxalt in Nevada.</p><p>Both states were still tabulating ballots and analysts said the gaps are expected to narrow in the coming days. Nevada and Arizona also had closely watched governors races that were also too early to call.</p><p>In Georgia, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and his Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, are headed to a runoff election on Dec. 6.</p><p>If Arizona and Nevada both stay in Democratic hands, Democrats would enter the Georgia runoff with at least a 50-50 majority. The question would be whether the Senate would stay evenly split or whether Democrats would hold a 51-49 majority, a composition that would make it easier for the party to clear nominees and legislation through committees.</p><p>An outright majority would also empower Senate Democratic committee chairmen to issue subpoenas, providing a counterbalance to expected House GOP-led investigations. Under a current power-sharing arrangement, Senate Democrats cannot issue subpoenas without Republican support.</p><p>Based on current trends, \"I think Democrats will keep both Nevada and Arizona,\" said Jessica Taylor, who follows Senate races for the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan tracker of congressional races. \"Democrats could actually add a seat to their majority.\"</p><p>In a closely watched race, former state House Speaker Tina Kotek, a Democrat, is projected to be Oregon's next governor, according to the Associated Press, following an unusually competitive race in the left-leaning state.</p><p>Polls ahead of Election Day showed Ms. Kotek and former state House GOP leader Christine Drazan neck and neck, with independent candidate Betsy Johnson trailing behind. Republicans were excited about the possibility of flipping the seat for the first time in 40 years. The race centered around frustrations with homelessness, crime and drug use in city streets and many voters said they were looking for change from Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat.</p><p>With tensions running high, former President Donald Trump used his social-media site to suggest that slow vote tabulations in Arizona and Nevada could open the door for fraud, in remarks that echoed his unfounded claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. In Nevada, which sends mail-in ballots to all active registered voters, counties must count ballots postmarked by Nov. 8 and received by Saturday, Nov. 12.</p><p>The Vote Count in Key Senate Races</p><p>https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-control-could-be-decided-by-these-remaining-midterm-votes-11667943356</p><p>\"Clark County, Nevada, has a corrupt voting system (be careful Adam!), as do many places in our soon to be Third World Country,\" he said. \"Arizona even said \"by the end of the week!\" - They want more time to cheat! Kari Lake MUST win!\"</p><p>By Thursday evening, Ms. Lake, a former TV anchor, was trailing Democrat Katie Hobbs, the secretary of state, by just over 1 percentage point in the Arizona governor's race. In Nevada, Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak was trailing Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo, a Republican, by just under 4 percentage points</p><p>\"Obviously, he's misinformed,\" said Joe Garcia, Clark County registrar of voters, of Mr. Trump. \"We couldn't go any faster now even if we wanted to.\" He said counting would continue through the weekend.</p><p>Bill Gates, the chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, which is tabulating ballots in Arizona's largest county, said counting would continue past Friday because 290,000 people had dropped off mail-in ballots on Election Day and signature verification had to happen before those votes were tabulated.</p><p>The results of Tuesday's elections revealed voter anxiety over the highest inflation in four decades, the state of the nation, abortion access and crime. The voting also showed the electorate remains polarized following a tumultuous few years marked by political upheaval, economic uncertainty and a global pandemic.</p><p>Democrats avoided the worst outcome because their voters came to the polls with high enthusiasm, according to voter surveys, while swing voters often broke in their favor. And the election wasn't the strong rejection of President Biden and the Democratic Party that many Republicans had predicted.</p><p>At an event in Washington, D.C. Thursday for Democratic volunteers and supporters, Mr. Biden said support for his agenda helped Democrats beat the historic trend of major midterm losses for the president's party.</p><p>\"We did beat the odds,\" he said, adding that more independents voted for Democrats than Republicans.</p><p>Divided government would pose challenges for Mr. Biden: Legislating would be difficult and Republicans will try to establish a competing agenda, laying the groundwork to challenge Democrats in the 2024 presidential campaign.</p><p>Republicans, campaigning on repairing the economy, have seen their tallies grow as results trickled in from crucial races around the country, but Democrats also made gains.</p><p>Republicans picked up a House seat in New Jersey, but were unable to unseat a Democratic incumbent they had targeted in Connecticut. Republicans beat the Democrats' House campaign chief in New York, but a Democrat flipped a long-held GOP seat in Michigan, according to the Associated Press.</p><p>Nathan Gonzales, publisher of Inside Elections, which provides nonpartisan analysis of political campaigns, said that his current expectation was that Republicans would win a net of four to 11 House seats. If Republicans gained only four House seats on a net basis, Democrats would retain control of the House.</p><p>\"Democrats still have a chance to hold the majority,\" he said. \"The talk from Republicans about taking away Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi's gavelâ€”it's premature.\"</p><p>The fate of several House races was settled with Associated Press calls throughout the day on Thursday.</p><p>Rep. Yvette Herrell (R., N.M.) lost her race against Democratic challenger Gabe Vasquez to represent New Mexico's second congressional district. The flipped seat means that all three of the state's congressional districts will be represented by Democrats.</p><p>Republican Ryan Zinke defeated Democratic candidate Monica Tranel to represent a new congressional district in Montana created by redistricting following the 2020 Census. Before the redrawn map, the state elected one House representative to Congress.</p><p>Mr. Zinke led the U.S. Department of Interior under the Trump administration and was elected to represent the state's lone House seat from 2015 to 2017.</p><p>A new-member orientation and the House Republican leadership election were set to begin next week, but it is unlikely all races will be resolved by then. In California, where five races were ranked as tossups by the Cook Political Report, results could be days or weeks away.</p><p>Competitive House races in Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Colorado and Arizona haven't been called and results could take days.</p><p>Chad Day, Katy Stech Ferek and Tarini Parti contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Eliza Collins at eliza.collins+1@wsj.com. and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com</p><p>GOP Inches Closer to Expected Narrow House Majority, With Senate Still a Tossup</p>",
