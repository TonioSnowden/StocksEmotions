  "title": "What the U.S. Should Learn From U.K. Cyber Strategy; Despite what Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says, cyber operations neither trigger perilous conflict nor do they make conflict more violent.",
  "text": "<p>The Trump administration veered in the other direction, promising to \"defend forward\" and \"persistently engage\" without saying what actions the administration viewed as off-limits for itself and its adversaries. While public reports suggested that the administration conducted some limited offensive cyberattacks, certain senior officials suggested the U.S. wanted to do far more, and the New York Times reported that the U.S. even targeted the Russian power grid.</p><p>Neither approach was optimal. The Obama administration leaned too far back, and the Trump administration too far forward. The Biden administration has a chance to get cyber strategy right by taking a lesson from the U.K.'s recently published National Cyber Strategy, which provocatively argues that offensive cyber operations provide \"a range of flexible, scalable, and de-escalatory measures . . . often in ways that avoid the need to put individuals at risk of physical harm.\" The strategy follows recent public statements by British leaders announcing offensive cyber operations, conducted with the U.S., intended to stem a surging tide of ransomware attacks. Whereas U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin described cyberspace as an arena in which \"the risks of escalation and miscalculation are high,\" the U.K. argues that cyber operations are tools for de-escalation.</p><p>Who's right? For the past several years, academics have studied the question of cyber escalation through experiments, war games, statistical analysis and case studies. The results don't support Mr. Austin's claim. There is little evidence that cyber operations trigger perilous conflict spirals or that cyber operations make conflict more violent. The same characteristics that make cyber operations less escalatory than conventional weapons—plausible deniability, virtual effects and transience—also make them poor substitutes for bombs and missiles.</p><p>Cyber operations excel as tools for deception, often through data manipulation and intelligence collection. Whether these operations can de-escalate a crisis is up for debate, but by expanding the foreign-policy tool kit, cyber operations could allow states to influence and shape one another's actions without resorting to violence.</p><p>How the U.S. uses and responds to cyber operations affects how norms of appropriate behavior in cyberspace develop. The Obama administration's assumptions about the risks of escalation from cyber operations may have given adversaries the impression that the U.S. didn't consider cyber threats a priority. This impression generated frustration from the private sector as intellectual-property theft and ransomware attacks increased.</p><p>But the Trump administration also struggled to turn risky cyber operations into strategic wins. Cyber operations reportedly used alongside conventional capabilities against Iran, against ISIS or in Afghanistan didn't seem to change outcomes. Ransomware attacks increased, and the SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange Server hacks were two of the most extensive cyber breaches in history.</p><p>The U.S. certainly needs to be more active in cyberspace and use its offensive cyber weapons to degrade the capability of criminals and states to attack private industry and undermine U.S. military power. But the U.S. should also clearly articulate what it won't attack. The U.S. should say it doesn't intend to use cyber operations to harm civilians or cause nuclear war—and that it will respond with force if an adversary conducts such cyberattacks against the U.S. or its allies. Meanwhile, the U.S. should prioritize cyber operations that collect intelligence as well as deceive and degrade the offensive cyber capabilities of adversaries like Russia and China.</p><p>As the Biden administration makes the final edits on its National Defense Strategy, it should learn from the U.K. Cyber operations can complement and augment existing foreign-policy options. The U.S. should lean in to cyber power while also clearly stating what actions are off the table.</p><p>Ms. Schneider is a fellow at the Hoover Institution.
