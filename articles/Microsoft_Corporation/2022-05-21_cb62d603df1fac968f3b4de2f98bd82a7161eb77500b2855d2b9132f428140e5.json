  "text": "<p>A little LinkedIn stalking to suss out how senior or buttoned-up an interviewer might be would behoove any job candidate. If you're meeting with a septuagenarian BigLaw partner, a full suit could earn approval. But if you're interviewing with someone a little greener at, say, a consulting firm, you can safely skip the tie and cuff links. \"By shifting the focus away from those decidedly conservative accessories, I think it reads a little more modern,\" said Turner Allen, a personal stylist and image consultant based in New York City. He suggests polished pieces you would wear in your everyday life -- things that seamlessly go from your interview to your lunch plans to picking up the kids at school.</p><p>A crisp polo shirt is often a reasonable gamble, but a simple, well-fitting Oxford button-down is foolproof. You can easily amp it up with a tie or sweater if more formality is in order, but it also says, \"Hey, I'm relaxed. Confident. Not trying too hard.\" Consider an Oxford in colors other than white and blue or an approachable pattern (a subtle check, stripe or micro-dot). According to Mr. Allen, that conveys that you can be \"creative and adaptable -- two traits employers tend to look for.\" But unless you're interviewing for a position at a kid-friendly candy store, don't get too crazy -- paisleys and big, pink polka dots might be creative, but they'll also give your prospective boss a migraine.</p><p>All that said, every situation and industry is different. For a broader perspective, we asked three seasoned interviewers in three different fields what job candidates have been wearing lately -- and what they should have done better.</p><p>Government Ordinances</p><p>Jordan Maynard, 33, Boston, Chief Secretary to the Governor</p><p>The Tale: I've conducted over 1,000 interviews in my three-plus years in the Governor's office. Prepandemic, I definitely expected the traditional suit-and-tie situation. Lately, I'm seeing more and more candidates wear sweaters instead of a dress shirt. And honestly I would not expect a full suit for a Zoom interview when somebody is sitting in their house. Last week, this young man in his early 20s came into the office for an interview, and I noticed he had a colorful Southern Tide tie, boat shoes and no socks. It's nice to have personality, but maybe wear socks.</p><p>The Tip: You can skip the suit, but I recommend wearing colorful socks. I like it when a candidate's personality comes through on their feet.</p><p>Rules of Law</p><p>Ru Bhatt, 40, New York, Partner at a Legal Recruiting Firm</p><p>The Tale: I speak with job candidates daily, and I coach them as to what they should wear to their law-firm interviews. I recently had this candidate who was great on paper but kept striking out, so I asked him to come to my office dressed as he would for an interview. He came in this ill-fitting suit with stains on it. I had to give him some very frank advice, and that was a tough situation. But the next interview, after he cleaned up his look, he got an offer.</p><p>The Tip: It's always good to wear a clean navy blazer with a nice shirt. Make sure it's ironed. For all these Zoom interviews, you only have your shoulders and head on screen, so you have to make them count.</p><p>Tech Support</p><p>Jon Wilson, 32, New York, VP Strategy and Corporate Development</p><p>The Tale: You see more casual dress these days because in this market, the candidates have the power. There have been moments when the candidate forgets about the interview, so when they get on Zoom they aren't prepared. You see them in graphic tees with spicy language. A full-blown suit is not required or expected in tech, but a graphic tee for an interview strikes me as surprising.</p><p>The Tip: When I see folks really buttoned-up, it can come across as nervous. I want people to be themselves. A polo shirt or a henley makes sense.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
