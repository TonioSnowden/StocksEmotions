  "text": "<p>   The 20 richest tech billionaires have collectively lost nearly half a trillion dollars this year amid the stock market's sharp tumble, a loss of wealth that is more than the market values of all but seven companies in the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>   The world's richest tech moguls -- including Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Larry Ellison -- have seen more than $480 billion in paper wealth disappear this year through Thursday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, a daily ranking of the richest people in the world. Disappointing earnings reports from a slew of tech giants this past week have stoked recession fears, pushed stock prices lower and weighed on the fortunes of the world's wealthiest people. </p><p>   Mr. Zuckerberg's net worth fell by $11.2 billion alone on Thursday, according to the ranking. Shares of his company, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., lost a quarter of their value after a disappointing earnings report spooked investors. </p><p>   So far this year, the wealth of Meta's chief executive has fallen by more than $87 billion. That leaves him with a current net worth of $37.7 billion, good for the 28th richest person in the world, according to the index. By comparison, he was among the top 10 earlier this year. </p><p>   Tech companies, which enjoyed strong growth in the beginning of the pandemic, are now feeling pain. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has fallen by 29% through Friday's close. </p><p>   For many executives and founders, their net worth is at least partially tied up in shares of their businesses. That means big swings in their companies' stock prices can have profound impacts. </p><p>   Elon Musk, the world's richest person, and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.com Inc., have each seen more than $58 billion in wealth wiped away this year. Both entrepreneurs have jockeyed in the past for the bragging rights of being the world's richest person before Mr. Musk pulled away with a sizable lead. </p><p>   Mr. Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc., also runs rocket company SpaceX. He founded Boring Co., an underground tunnel business, as well as neuroscience startup Neuralink Corp. And this week, he completed his on-again, off-again takeover of Twitter Inc. Mr. Musk is currently worth $212 billion. </p><p>   The wealth of Mr. Bezos, meanwhile, is valued at $134 billion. Amazon's shares fell 6.8% on Friday as Wall Street was disappointed with the company's sales forecast for the current quarter. </p><p>   Google parent Alphabet Inc. co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who are among the 10 richest people in the world, have also seen their net worth dented. They have each lost more than $40 billion in paper wealth this year, with both taking a hit this past week after Alphabet reported its first-ever drop in YouTube year-over-year ad sales. </p><p></p>",
