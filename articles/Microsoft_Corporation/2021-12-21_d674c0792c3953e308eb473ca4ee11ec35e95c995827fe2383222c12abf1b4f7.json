  "title": "Do Young Americans Have 'a God-Shaped Hole'? Students ponder religion in light of Pascal's metaphor.",
  "text": "<p>American youth have not turned away from the divine. They have merely filled that hole with something new. The routine that past generations followed, flocking to their places of worship or turning to Scripture for guidance, is now fulfilled by following Instagram idols and retweeting their posts.</p><p>This new religion is most evident in those who adopt the mannerisms and markers of a political movement. Like Jewish males wearing their yarmulkes, a Trump supporter dons a red MAGA hat. Meanwhile, progressives sport their Nalgene bottle with stickers claiming that \"Water Is a Right\" or some other statement to broadcast that they are on the right side of history. The woke have adopted all the hallmarks of religion, from rituals of recognizing privilege, crafting new language, and proselytizing the holy truth to which all must conform or face eternal damnation.</p><p>Pascal was right—we all desire God, and my contemporaries have filled the void in themselves with political movements and tweets.</p><p>—Joshua Pearson, George Mason University, international security</p><p>Religion Makes Human Connections</p><p>Religion creates small, close-knit communities. These communities provide connections—friends, mentors, even romantic partners. Religious communities also give members a sense of belonging and impart a shared set of morals. Congregants help one another in times of prosperity and turn to one another for help in times of need, creating a safety net. In short, religion provides social capital.</p><p>Religion does not have a monopoly on social capital, and our generation could find some secular analogues. But by turning away from religion without some other community to take its place, we risk making the country more divided at a dangerous point in our history.</p><p>By turning away from religion, we are not so much missing a part of ourselves as we are missing parts of one another. What we lose is not God, but the better angels of our communal nature. We find on the altar of secularization not a diminished inner spirituality, but the dissolution of ties with our common kindred.</p><p>—Max Willner-Giwerc, University of Chicago, law (J.D.)</p><p>The Reasonableness of Secularism</p><p>Blaise Pascal's ideas ought to be understood in the context of the 1600s. As a highly educated French mathematician and mystical philosopher, he was exposed to realities that Americans don't experience. France originated in principles that relied on an understanding of God. In the 1600s, it was rare to encounter someone with a secular mindset.</p><p>Applying Pascal's claim of a God-shaped hole to young Americans today would be to reduce the identity of an entire population to a missing part. This would be a rash injustice to those young Americans with a secular viewpoint, who grew up in an areligious world.</p><p>Modern politics rejects the proposition of gospel truth. Truth simply no longer exists. Arguments are easily reduced to the phrase \"You do you.\" In many ways, technology has replaced God. Mysteries of the universe are no longer attributed to a divine figure. An American turn away from religion is reasonably warranted.</p><p>—Isabella Barrett, Belmont Abbey College, politics, philosophy and economics</p><p>Our Search for Meaning</p><p>When we invite God into our lives, we realize that the world doesn't revolve around us. Life is centered on serving God through generous acts of love for other people. The reason that Meta appeals to so many is because it's a world where everything is under the user's control. There's no such thing as suffering in a metaverse, a fake world. My generation has been taught to avoid suffering at all costs, but to quote Viktor Frankl, \"If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering.\"</p><p>The trials and sorrows of everyday life can make sense only if we have faith that God will not abandon us. If we don't hold firm to this, we will live in a constant state of anxiety and resentment. If we do hold firm to this, suffering will have meaning, and life can be joyful. Not easy, but joyful.</p><p>—Nathaniel Valyo, Seton Hall University, economics</p><p>Spirituality and Politics</p><p>Young Americans are turning away from religious institutions, but they remain invested in spiritual matters. According to Pew Research, a growing number of young Americans identify as \"spiritual but not religious.\" I think that secularism is actually weakened when people see their faith as coming from outside established institutions. It's relatively easy to put a fence between organized religion and government, but much harder to separate politics from spirit. I predict the boundaries between faith and politics will blur, rather than solidify, in the coming years.</p><p>—Thomas Brodey, Amherst College, history</p><p>The Impulse of Religion</p><p>Increased secularization might have changed our behavior, but it has not curbed our urge to worship something, even if that something is ourselves. In an increasingly secular society, Americans have lost many of the healthy outlets they once had. Religion has always been a way for people to claim an identity, build community and create purpose for their lives. Without these outlets forcing them to look outward, Americans have become steadily more self-absorbed. This phenomenon is only encouraged by social media, which convinces people that self-expression should be their priority.</p><p>Religion gives meaning to human lives, which otherwise can feel purposeless. Despite cultural changes and waning religious affiliations, human nature has not fundamentally changed. All people still long to be loved and to feel as though their lives are meaningful. Young, nonreligious Americans continue to search for purpose and identity. They try to find them in gyms and therapist's offices and places of work. The fervor with which young Americans do all this can be described only as religious.</p><p>Although they are less likely to be found in a synagogue or church, they are not less likely to have these religious impulses. People still seek forgiveness for their wrongdoings, and they pursue anything that seems as though it will make them feel significant.</p><p>—Ivy Young, University of North Carolina, journalism</p><p>Click here to submit a response to next week's Future View.</p><p>If you are interested in an internship with The Wall Street Journal, applications are open.
