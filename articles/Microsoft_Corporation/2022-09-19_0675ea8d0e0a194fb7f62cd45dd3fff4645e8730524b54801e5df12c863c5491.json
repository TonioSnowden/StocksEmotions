  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite last week notched their biggest weekly declines since June, as investors confronted a slew of corporate warnings that raised alarm bells about the trajectory of the U.S. economy. Companies such as FedEx and General Electric were among those that pointed to signs of economic troubles. </p><p>The messages sparked worries among investors about the extent to which corporate earnings can hold up as the Fed keeps raising interest rates and the U.S. economy potentially heads for a significant recession.</p><p>For much of this year, investors have been heartened by largely resilient corporate results, even in the face of decades-high inflation. But sliding earnings estimates lately have forced some investors to reconsider how much exposure they want to have to stocks.</p><p>This week, investors are largely focused on a round of interest-rate decisions by central banks. The Fed's decision will be followed by the Bank of England on Thursday.</p><p>Futures bets on Monday morning showed that investors anticipate an 80% chance that the Fed will raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point, according to CME Group. The data also showed investors anticipating a 20% chance that the central bank will lift rates by a full percentage point.</p><p>\"We're afraid that the Fed could surprise us with another jumbo hike,\" said Florian Ielpo, head of macro at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. Last week's corporate warnings, he said, suggested \"we very well could be at the entry point of the U.S. recession.\"</p><p>This week, investors will parse results from companies including Costco Wholesale and home builder Lennar. They will also get full earnings results from FedEx on Thursday after its sales warning last week.</p><p>Some traders have grown accustomed this year to rebounds after bouts of selling. Last week marked the eighth time this year that the S&amp;P 500 has lost at least 3% on a weekly basis.</p><p>During the previous seven occasions, the benchmark index finished the following week higher four times, with an average gain of 4.4%, analysts at JPMorgan Chase said in a note Monday, adding that any rally would likely be concentrated in mega-cap tech stocks, among others.</p><p>Most large tech stocks declined, with Tesla, Amazon.com and Microsoft all shedding 0.7% or more. Netflix was an outlier, gaining about 1.4%.</p><p>Investors' risk aversion spread beyond stocks Monday. Bitcoin fell about 4.7% from its 5 p.m. ET level Sunday to about $18,797.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 3.479%, from 3.447% Friday. The two-year yield, which is much more sensitive to near-term interest rate expectations, rose to 3.936%, from 3.859%. Yields and bond prices move inversely.</p><p>Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, fell 2.9% to $88.72, extending its recent slide, as investors continue to worry about how rising interest rates and a flagging economy will dent energy demand.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.6%. Trading on the London Stock Exchange was closed due to Queen Elizabeth II's funeral. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1%, while China's Shanghai Composite fell 0.3%. Trading in Japan was closed due to a holiday.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Open Lower as Investors Await Fed Meeting This Week</p>",
