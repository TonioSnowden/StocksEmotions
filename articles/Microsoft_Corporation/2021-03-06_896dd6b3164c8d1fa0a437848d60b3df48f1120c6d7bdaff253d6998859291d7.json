  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Pow! Bam! It's SPAC-Man!  ---  He's a hero of the amateur-trading masses and a charmer of Wall Street stalwarts. Chamath Palihapitiya is riding the financial  moment with a blend of social-media savvy (1.4 million Twitter followers and counting), deal-making prowess and sheer moxie.  ----  By Peter Rudegeair and Maureen Farrell",
  "text": "<p>   It was Jan. 4, and Chamath Palihapitiya was ready to tease another deal. \"Shooters Shoot,\" he tweeted to his followers, along with a GIF of Alec Baldwin berating weary salesmen to \"Always Be Closing.\" The retweets and likes for the \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" reference came fast and furious. \"We're ready,\" one follower replied. </p><p>   Three days later, when Mr. Palihapitiya announced his intention to take online lender Social Finance Inc. public via a \"blank-check\" company known as a SPAC, Reddit message boards popular with the day-trading crowd lit up. One fan called it a \"stock that you buy with hopes of transforming you into a millionaire\" -- even though SoFi did not expect to be profitable until 2023 and faced stiff competition. </p><p>   Mr. Palihapitiya is the man of the market moment. The founder of tech-investing firm Social Capital Holdings Inc. has charmed Wall Street to raise billions of dollars to bring startups public. Amateur traders hang on his every word for clues about his next target -- and for the insults he hurls at the high-finance elite. (Hedge funds, he said last April, deserved to get wiped out when coronavirus shutdowns devastated the economy.) </p><p>   Wall Street has always had its rock stars. Warren Buffett's carnival-like annual meeting, after all, is nicknamed \"Woodstock for Capitalists.\" But Mr. Palihapitiya, a former Facebook Inc. executive who now has 1.4 million Twitter followers, belongs to a new class of market influencers -- social-media savants who've figured out how to take shots at the establishment while taking its money. </p><p>   No one has marshaled the twin forces reshaping markets -- the blank-check boom and the retail-trading surge -- quite like Mr. Palihapitiya. So far this year, as of Thursday, 225 companies that use money from initial public offerings to buy established businesses have raised roughly $71 billion -- a figure that accounts for more than 70% of all public stock sales, according to Dealogic data. These outfits are known as \"blank-check\" firms or SPACs, an acronym that stands for special-purpose acquisition companies. </p><p>   Ordinary investors, homebound and flush with cash, are fueling the surge. Social Capital raised $3.7 billion for five SPACs last year and filed confidentially to raise money for seven more, according to people familiar with the matter. They have helped make Mr. Palihapitiya a fortune -- at least on paper. Their structure gives Mr. Palihapitiya the right to buy one-fifth of its outstanding shares at discount prices. That means he is sitting on a mountain of gains. </p><p>   SoFi, a decade-old startup that made its name refinancing student loans, is his latest prize. He and his bankers pitched some of Wall Street's top firms to participate in the deal, and Mr. Palihapitiya's pull with stalwarts like money manager BlackRock Inc. was a big reason why the lender spurned other SPAC suitors and accepted Mr. Palihapitiya's offer, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   He unveiled the $8.7 billion deal to the public on Jan. 7 -- on CNBC and on Twitter, naturally. Nearly 65 million shares of Mr. Palihapitiya's Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. V changed hands that day, more than all but 22 U.S.-listed stocks, according to Dow Jones Market Data. IPOE, as it is known, closed up 58% at $19.14, even though the deal wasn't final and the SPAC had no real assets yet. </p><p>   A Sri Lankan immigrant to Canada whose family got by on welfare payments when he was a child, Mr. Palihapitiya graduated from the University of Waterloo and worked at Bank of Montreal before moving to the U.S. during the dot-com era. He joined Facebook in 2007 to help grow its user base after stints at a venture-capital firm and America Online; he left in 2011 after he said Mark Zuckerberg denied his request to start a mobile-phone business and later emerged as a critic of his former employer. </p><p>   He used the money he made at Facebook to fund a lifestyle of billionaire whimsy. He is a partial owner of the Golden State Warriors, a three-time contestant in the World Series of Poker and a cryptocurrency evangelist who said he paid $1.6 million in bitcoin for an undeveloped property in Lake Tahoe. \"When BTC hits $100k, I'm going to buy @GoldmanSachs and rename it Chamathman Sachs,\" he recently tweeted the weekend before he also publicly toyed with running for governor of California. </p><p>   Recently, Mr. Palihapitiya has been touting a plan to \"fix climate change,\" as he tweeted last month. He has approached potential investors about raising billions of dollars for a partnership with tech giants on climate efforts, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   The year he left Facebook, he founded Social Capital with a mission of backing young startups that want to solve the world's toughest problems. He gravitated to SPACs as a way to provide an alternative path to the public markets for startups that didn't want to deal with the costs, hassle and uncertainty of a prolonged registration process. </p><p>   Mr. Palihapitiya called the idea \"IPO 2.0.\" A SPAC avoids many of the rules governing a traditional IPO by executing a reverse merger between a corporate shell that raised the money and a private company that takes both the cash and the shell's stock listing. Mr. Palihapitiya raised money for his first SPAC, Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp., in 2017. </p><p>   Not everyone was enamored with that first SPAC attempt. Tech companies, including Slack Technologies Inc. where Social Capital was an early investor, rebuffed Mr. Palihapitiya's efforts to take them public via his SPAC, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   During this period Mr. Palihapitiya often frustrated his colleagues with his extended absences from the office and meetings. Those absences would occasionally cause him to miss fundraising meetings he had set up for himself and Tony Bates, a former Skype CEO who joined Social Capital to lead a growth-investing unit Mr. Palihapitiya launched in 2017, some of the people said. </p><p>   Mr. Palihapitiya's now ex-wife was a partner at Social Capital. While they were still married, he traveled with a new woman he was dating, according to people familiar with the matter. Partners left. Some other projects, including a credit-investing fund, fell by the wayside. Nonetheless, Social Capital was able to earn an annualized internal rate of return of 33% in its first eight years, it said in its most recent annual letter. </p><p>   Mr. Palihapitiya got his big break as a SPAC investor from billionaire Richard Branson. </p><p>   Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc., Mr. Branson's space-tourism company, called off a roughly $1 billion financing deal with Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund in October 2018, after the Saudi government was linked to the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. </p><p>   Throughout 2019, Mr. Palihapitiya, Mr. Branson and their teams spent months negotiating a deal to take Virgin Galactic public through a SPAC merger. Over meetings in Park City, Utah, and at Mr. Branson's Necker Island in the Caribbean, the two sides hammered out an arrangement that included a $100 million personal investment from Mr. Palihapitiya. The deal, which valued the company at roughly $2 billion, closed that fall. </p><p>   Mr. Palihapitiya went viral in April 2020, just as he began fundraising for two additional SPACs. After appearing on CNBC to urge the government not to bail out wealthy investors in airlines and other hard-hit companies, he gained about 100,000 new followers on Twitter, according to social-media data company Captiv8 (Social Capital is an investor in Captiv8). </p><p>   \"We're talking about -- a hedge fund that serves a bunch of billionaire family offices? Who cares?\" Mr. Palihapitiya said. \"They don't get to summer in the Hamptons? Who cares!\" </p><p>   The rant endeared him to amateur investors. \"Through all the pain watching all of our portfolios go up in flames the past few weeks, this motherf---er came in and spoke for all us and really put a smile on my face,\" one trader wrote in a post on Reddit's WallStreetBets that was upvoted about 2,000 times. </p><p>   Meanwhile, Mr. Palihapitiya was reeling in Wall Street investors. Before coronavirus lockdowns put an end to schmoozing, he hosted dinners and meetings to pitch his SPACs to hedge funds. When the SPACs made their market debut in April, hedge funds, the target of his flamethrowing, were the primary buyers. </p><p>   Mr. Palihapitiya found big targets for two of his SPACs last fall, taking house-flipping startup Opendoor Labs Inc. public in a deal worth $6.3 billion and insurance-tech startup Clover Health Investments Corp. to market at a $4.4 billion valuation. Big institutional investors including BlackRock, Fidelity Investments and Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into the deals alongside Mr. Palihapitiya. </p><p>   \"It was like this guy walks on water,\" said Michael Edwards, deputy chief investment officer of Weiss Multi-Strategy Advisers LLC, who invested in Mr. Palihapitiya's first SPAC. \"Everything he does is going to be oversubscribed.\" </p><p>   In December and March, Mr. Palihapitiya sold 10 million shares of Virgin Galactic to free up more than $300 million for other ventures, according to securities filings. (He indirectly co-owns an additional 15.75 million shares through an investment vehicle.) Mr. Palihapitiya and the other managers of the SPAC that took Opendoor public are sitting on paper gains of about $475 million on the warrants and discounted shares they received through the IPO of the SPAC, as well as for their participation in a related private placement of the SPAC shares, according to estimates based on an analysis of securities filings by Michael Ohlrogge, a professor at New York University's law school. </p><p>   Mr. Palihapitiya is separately looking to start a new family of SPACs for biotech companies, some of the people said. </p><p></p>",
