  "text": "<p><strong>It will be a while</strong> before an art collection can rival that of Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, which made a total of $1.6bn across two auctions at Christie's last week. But on Monday evening, Sotheby's New York harnessed the market confidence with strong results for 23 works that belonged to the late lawyer David Solinger, first president of the board of New York's Whitney Museum. His collection of Modern art, bought mostly from galleries in the 1950s, sold for a total $116.4mn ($137.9mn with fees), at the top end of an $87mn-$118mn presale estimate. </p> <p>Success was less of a given as, unlike at most auctions these days, no works were guaranteed to sell, allowing the market to find its level on the night. Highlights included Willem de Kooning's “Collage” (1950), which sold for $29mn ($33.6mn with fees, est $18mn-$25mn) and Alberto Giacometti's “Trois hommes qui marchent (grand plateau)” (cast in 1952) for $26mn ($30.2mn with fees, est $15mn-$20mn). Not everything flew. Three of five paintings by Paul Klee sold for below their low estimates while an early painting of Marie-Thérèse Walter by Picasso, estimated at between $15mn and $20mn, sold for $8.4mn ($10mn with fees).</p> <p><strong>Mixed-owner evening auctions</strong> now seem run-of-the-mill relative to the razzmatazz single-collector sales. Still, on Wednesday night at Sotheby's contemporary art sale, Andy Warhol's tough, 12ft-high “White Disaster [White Car Crash 19 Times]” (1963), guaranteed at the last minute, sold for $74mn ($85.4mn with fees, est $80mn). The auction house might have hoped for more, but it's a steep climb for a work that, in 1987, sold for $660,000. The sale overall came in just below estimates at $231.1mn ($269.1mn with fees) for 38 works while its “Now” auction of 22 even more contemporary pieces met expectations at $37.5mn ($45.8mn with fees).</p> <p>Earlier in the week, the same auction house scraped a record for Piet Mondrian, whose “Composition No. II” (1930) sold for $48mn ($51mn with fees, estimate $50mn). Mondrian's previous auction high was a fee-inclusive $50.6mn. In a generally patchy sale of 44 works, Sotheby's confirmed that the Mondrian was bought and underbid by collectors from Asia. Three other works, by Alexander Calder, Joan Miró and Auguste Rodin, went to buyers from Asia, Sotheby's said. Eight works went unsold, though the auction overall still made $220mn on the night ($253.3mn with fees, est $227mn-293mn).&#xa0;</p> <p>On Tuesday night, Phillips sold $115.7mn of modern and contemporary art ($139mn with fees, est $114.8mn-$159.5mn), though again the results were mixed. Top lot was a 2005 Cy Twombly which sold for a within-estimate $36mn ($41.6mn with fees), but appetite waned for some of the art market's previous figurative darlings, including Amy Sherald and Amoako Boafo. This season's hot artist seems to be the more ethereal, LA-based Lucy Bull (born 1990) whose 2019 painting was the best performer against estimate at Phillips selling for $380,000 ($478,800 with fees); while at Sotheby's her “16:43” (2020) sold for $420,000 ($529,200 with fees) — both against an estimate of $100,000-$150,000.</p> <p><strong>Gagosian Gallery has revealed a board of directors</strong> comprising eight gallery staff, including owner Larry Gagosian and chief operating officer Andrew Fabricant, plus 12 members from areas outside, but increasingly adjacent to, the art world. Among these is Delphine Arnault, executive vice-president of Louis Vuitton, a member of LVMH's board of directors and executive committee and daughter of its billionaire owner Bernard Arnault. </p> <p>Delphine Arnault's formalised role with the gallery might explain the recent rumours about LVMH buying Gagosian outright (which have been consistently denied). It also seems to explain why the gallery chose to make its board public, even though it has existed for nearly a year, hoping to unravel any crossed wires — though they say this is not the case.</p> <p>Among the other external advisers are film-maker Sofia Coppola, hedge fund supremo J Tomilson Hill and Evan Spiegel, chief executive of Snap. One artist, Jenny Saville, also sits on the board. “I wanted people who are groundbreakers in their own industries to help me break new ground in ours,” Gagosian told the FT.</p> <p><strong>Despite decent business</strong> at the start of this year's concurrent Art021 and West Bund Art &amp; Design and fairs in Shanghai (which opened on November 10), both events had to close early because of China's stringent zero-Covid policy. A Shanghai government statement confirmed that there was one positive case reported from Art021. Overseas travellers to Shanghai had already spent at least seven days in quarantine before the fairs while visitors from Beijing faced strict measures to return. “To say we were shocked when they closed early is an understatement,” one gallerist said. </p> <p>There's been no talk of compensation, with most non-Shanghai visitors focused first on leaving town before their close-contact codes could turn red and force more quarantines. “People are understandably frustrated because of all the efforts they put in but, given the uncertainties, it was rewarding to see such dedication [from galleries, artists and collectors] to come,” says Lihsin Tsai, senior director at Hauser &amp; Wirth. Her gallery brought works from the estate of Günther Förg to the West Bund fair and made sales at all levels, topped by a 30-part work which went to a mainland private museum for €525,000.</p> <p><strong>In Hong Kong, Art Basel has announced</strong> that the China-born Angelle Siyang-Le has stepped up from her latest role as Art Basel's head of development, Greater China, to become director of the Hong Kong fair. Adeline Ooi remains director of Asia and takes on a more strategic role within the continent, where Art Basel already supports events such as the recent Art Week Tokyo. </p> <p>Next year's Art Basel Hong Kong will run March 23-25 and is on track to have 171 galleries, a far greater number than this year (130) now that the region has lifted its compulsory hotel quarantines. Siyang-Le acknowledges that if mainland China's restrictions remain, they would impact her fair, but notes that it managed to run successfully, and attract mainland visitors, in 2021 and 2022 when quarantines were longer.</p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter</em></p><p>Source: Melanie Gerlis 2022 'Is the art market finally cooling?'
