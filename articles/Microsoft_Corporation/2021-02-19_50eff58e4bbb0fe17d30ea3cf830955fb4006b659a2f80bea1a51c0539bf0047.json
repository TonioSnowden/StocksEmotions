In an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15853717-af6c-4858-87d4-58b1826895a8\">exclusive FT interview</a>, French president <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> said Europe and the US should urgently allocate 5 per cent of their current vaccine supplies. He warned of a “war of influence over vaccines”, with Russia and China filling a gap left by rich countries.</p> <p>Although Biden's administration <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e00fe88e-263c-41da-9ac5-fdbbd71c928a\">rejected Macron's proposal</a>, with one official saying “our current focus is on vaccinating Americans”, it also said it would “almost immediately” donate $2bn to <strong>Covax</strong>, the global scheme for supplying vaccines to the developing world, with a further $2bn over the next two years.</p> <p>Johnson wants the UK, which has ordered more than 400m vaccine doses for a population of 67m, to donate its surplus supply to poorer countries. He urged the G7 to step up its Covax funding, and the meeting concluded with total pledges to the scheme of $7.5bn.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the <strong>African Union</strong> announced that it had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1855d871-69c6-3f3b-8719-009fe6253bc6#post-60908\">secured 300m doses</a> of Russia's <strong>Sputnik V</strong> vaccine, which has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5fa265d-6616-4fcf-988a-deaefa532669\">also been sold</a> to countries including Algeria, Argentina and Brazil. China's two leading manufacturers, Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech, have signed deals with countries including Indonesia, Egypt and the Philippines.</p> <p>Hopes for a faster global vaccine rollout were boosted by the news that the jab made by <strong>BioNTech/Pfizer</strong> can be stored at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/919d16c8-0a40-4389-bac9-04a48fdb0a36\">between minus 15C and minus 25C</a> instead of the minus 60C to minus 80C originally required, and by an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1855d871-69c6-3f3b-8719-009fe6253bc6#post-60892\">Israeli study</a> indicating that it is 85 per cent effective after a single dose.</p> <p>At least one country intends to do without inoculations altogether: John Magufuli, president of <strong>Tanzania</strong>, has declared them <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5dd89bb4-2efb-4195-a38a-ece11993f3b5\">dangerous and unnecessary</a>, and said his country had largely escaped Covid-19 — to the alarm of experts in neighbouring states.</p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p><strong>Europe's manufacturers</strong> have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d950571-2900-4228-8c1a-23025bf0f281\">recovered strongly</a> from the pandemic this month, according to the IHS Markit purchasing managers' survey, as demand from Asia stimulates activity. But <strong>services</strong> experienced a downturn, with lockdown restrictions forcing many businesses to stay closed. Meanwhile, policymakers at the <strong>European Central Bank</strong> have committed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ecd6cb93-5967-4e69-8d81-707c85008ec7\">persist with stimulus measures</a>, despite rising inflation.</p> <p>Official figures show that the <strong>UK government</strong> ran a record deficit of £8.8bn last month, as chancellor Rishi Sunak hinted at the possibility of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d27232d6-971a-46fa-912d-9766cab6e11d\">tax rises</a> to “return the public finances to a more sustainable footing”. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1a526ba-f1c8-45df-88f1-9aa32fa4af3e\">Further data</a> showed a sharp fall in <strong>retail sales</strong> in January, while <strong>manufacturing activity</strong> hit a nine-month low.</p> <p>Nearly a year on from the start of the pandemic, we can take stock of which economies have weathered it best, says <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30f436b1-0d92-41db-9932-e096e9f53e92\">economics editor Chris Giles</a>. Countries that controlled the virus effectively took less of a hit, but having a large manufacturing sector also helped — factors that propelled <strong>China</strong> to the top of the 2020 economic performance table.</p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>Carmaker <strong>Renault</strong> suffered an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5455da28-a010-4d43-ac0e-fb204ec69331\">€8bn loss in 2020</a> as the pandemic hit demand across Europe. The company warned that a global <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13094950-fb45-4686-9ef9-8199c674b90d\">shortage of microchips</a> — caused by surging demand for digital technology during lockdown — could force it to curb production by 100,000 vehicles this year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Reinsurance group <strong>Swiss Re</strong> reported a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df4c4a08-eb00-4213-a050-ba15da21a3b5\">loss of $878m</a> last year, its first since the 2008-09 financial crisis, with pandemic-related claims costing it $3.9bn. The company said that, were it not for Covid-19, it would have been on course to make a net profit of $2.2bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Other companies delivered more upbeat results. Benefiting from the surge in online sales during lockdown, UK warehouse group <strong>Segro</strong> reported adjusted pre-tax <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0549c1cf-73a0-4a4d-a7b2-e2abd5c6d6d7\">profits of £296.5m</a> in 2020, up 10.8 per cent on the previous year, and said that consumer habits were likely to have “changed irrevocably”. French luxury goods group <strong>Hermès</strong> posted a net <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff11a14e-6ffd-4961-8ada-976c76f83975\">profit of </a><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5455da28-a010-4d43-ac0e-fb204ec69331\">€</a><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff11a14e-6ffd-4961-8ada-976c76f83975\">1.4bn</a>, helped by strong Chinese demand for its scarves and handbags.</p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p><strong>Sterling</strong> reached $1.40 today, its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e521ec25-e968-49a3-a3ba-e4bff19deb9d\">highest level since 2018</a>, as investors anticipated a strong economic recovery following the UK's rapid vaccination campaign. The currency — which fell to as low as $1.14 when the pandemic hit in March — has risen 2.4 per cent against the dollar and 3 per cent against the euro since the end of 2020.</p> <p><strong>Chinese stocks</strong> briefly hit a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2370bc1-ca17-4bc3-9fcc-6afc961669f6\">record high</a> on Thursday as traders returned from the lunar new year holiday. The CSI 300 index touched 5,931 points, beating its 2007 record, before subsiding. Friday's trading was more muted, with an overall gain of 0.2 per cent.</p> <p>Expectations of rising inflation, fuelled by loose Federal Reserve monetary policy and Joe Biden's proposed stimulus package, have boosted <strong>US bond yields</strong>, with the benchmark 10-year US Treasury reaching 1.3 per cent this week. That could pose a threat to buoyant US equity markets, say <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00c99cd2-7f9a-4a37-bb20-ce8d96f2527f#comments-anchor\">FT correspondents Aziza Kasumov and Colby Smith</a>, with investors now scrambling to find the tipping point for equities.&#xa0;</p> <h2>The essentials</h2> <p>As Britons wait for prime minister Boris Johnson to announce his plan for lifting lockdown, many are itching to book a <strong>vacation</strong>. They might regret doing so, warns <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/919300ab-a4bf-45ad-a968-f64636291639\">consumer editor Claer Barrett</a>, who advises readers to consider less risky alternatives. “Friends who live in interesting places, have second homes or gardens big enough to erect a family-sized tent in are fast becoming the most valuable contacts in your address book.”</p> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p>“How can I help?”: it is, writes <strong>Bill Gates</strong>, the question he is most often asked when discussing <strong>climate change</strong>. While it's hard to find a satisfying answer, there are ways to make a measurable difference to the climate — though as his new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c11bb885-1274-4677-ba05-fcbac67dc808\">green manifesto</a> makes clear, they will require business leaders who are willing to shoulder unfamiliar risks.</p><p>Source: Neville Hawcock 2021 'G7 pledges faster vaccine rollout to developing world' FT.com 19 February.
