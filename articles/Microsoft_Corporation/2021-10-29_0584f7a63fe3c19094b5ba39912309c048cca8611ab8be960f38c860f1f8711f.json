Chief Executive Jane Fraser said banks, businesses and investors are addressing climate change. Now governments need to step in to make those commitments more effective.</p><p>On her first day as CEO in March, Ms. Fraser pledged to make the bank's financing portfolio carbon neutral by 2050. That requires both pushing Citigroup clients to reduce their emissions and creating investments to support green projects.</p><p>\"If you don't have the energy policy frameworks and you don't have commitments from the countries, it's then very difficult for us to deliver on the commitments that we're making,\" Ms. Fraser said. \"There's quite a high degree of dependency there.\"</p><p>Corporate clients need support from government and nongovernmental agencies, she said, and they need realistic paths that pressure them to follow through.</p><p>For instance, she said, developing nations working on long-term sustainable projects have struggled to get large investors on board. The investors, such as pension funds or asset managers, say they are eager for such projects but worry about risks, such as currencies losing value over the multiyear life of the investments. They would normally hedge those risks but there are few takers for long-term bets like that in developing nations.</p><p>To fill the gap, Ms. Fraser said, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund or other global development funds need to step in and take the other side of the hedges.</p><p>\"This then enables the money from the developed-world insurer or asset manager or pension fund to go into an emerging market that isn't investment grade and actually invest in sustainable finance projects,\" Ms. Fraser said.</p><p>Ms. Fraser, a native of Scotland, had other recommendations for the global citizens heading to Glasgow and its often unique cuisine: Try the fish.</p><p>\"The seafood in Scotland is absolutely delicious. So sticking with some good halibut or salmon or the like, is often safe,\" she said. \"Probably avoid the haggis when you're a newbie.\"</p><p>David Benoit</p><p>Scott Kirby, chief executive of United Airlines Holdings Inc. </p><p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said airlines need to get in front of emissions reductions. PHOTO: Cooper Neill for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>United Airlines Holdings Inc. CEO Scott Kirby said carbon emissions reductions must move to the top of airlines' priority list.</p><p>\"We can either choose to do it voluntarily, or we can have it imposed on us. But it is coming,\" he said. \"It's much better to get in front of it and to do the right thing, as opposed to having haphazard regulatory regimes that are different in different parts of the world.\"</p><p>Aircraft account for about 2% of global carbon-dioxide emissions, and airlines face pressure from travelers, including corporations that spend heavily on business travel tickets, to make flying greener.</p><p>Yet there are few options currently available for replacing oil-based jet fuel or containing the industry's emissions. Aircraft engines are becoming more efficient, but Covid-19 aside, global travel demand is growing and outpacing those gains.</p><p>Mr. Kirby said the summit will be an opportunity to convene with like-minded people in industry, government and nonprofits to generate new ideas and potential investments.</p><p>\"It's also about just finding other people that are similarly—if I can say nerdy—about the science and want to come up with real solutions,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Kirby has criticized the purchase of carbon offsets—one of corporate America's favorite ways to cancel out emissions—saying efforts to plant more trees won't come close to offsetting growing emissions. Instead, United has invested in a venture developing a facility to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere through a process known as direct air capture and sequester it underground.</p><p>United has also backed developing technologies, including a 19-seat electric plane being developed by Heart Aerospace.</p><p>But electric and hydrogen aircraft aren't going to be able to replace big, long-distance airplanes in the foreseeable future, Mr. Kirby said.</p><p>Meanwhile, carriers including United are trying to spur development of sustainable aviation fuel, which is currently more expensive than conventional jet fuel and only sparsely produced. Global airlines this month pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050, a goal that largely depends on a massive increase in sustainable aviation fuel production.</p><p>Alison Sider</p><p>Brad Smith, president of Microsoft Corp.</p><p>Microsoft Corp. is a corporate sponsor of COP26. The company's president, Brad Smith, who will be attending in-person, hopes that the event will help turn more company environmental pledges into reality. Mr. Smith points out that over the past few years, more than 1,500 companies with combined sales of more than $11.4 trillion have made net-zero commitments.</p><p>\"If we don't turn pledges into progress,\" Mr. Smith said, \"we run the real risk of fostering confusion and even cynicism.\"</p><p>Microsoft has set its own ambitious carbon reduction initiative. In early 2020, the Redmond, Wash. software company pledged to become carbon negative by 2030, meaning it would take more carbon out of the air than its operations produce. And it said by 2050, it planned to eliminate all emissions it had ever produced since the business began in 1975.</p><p>After the first year since making that pledge, the company saw a 6% reduction in emissions, said Mr. Smith.</p><p>There are issues around environmental policy language, he said.</p><p>\"Companies are quick to declare victory reaching net zero, but not everybody is counting everything the same way,\" said Mr. Smith. \"That's not a path to progress.\"</p><p>There is also an issue around organizations accurately measuring carbon emissions, or what Microsoft calls carbon accounting. Mr. Smith said the world needs to develop better carbon accounting where it becomes something similar to the financial reporting that companies undertake.</p><p>\"We need to have a common approach to measurement,\" he said. \"We need to recognize that the systems right now are really remarkably nascent.\"</p><p>That is an issue Microsoft has a direct business interest in as it comes out with its Cloud for Sustainability, a new cloud service that helps its customers automate the task of carbon accounting.</p><p>\"Unless we get to the heart of what it takes to measure emissions, we'll never get to the heart of what it takes to manage and reduce them,\" Mr. Smith said.</p><p>Microsoft will have a big presence at the conference as a principal partner with a booth, and Mr. Smith himself will be attending for several days in Glasgow.</p><p>\"I don't think the world can come together to solve the climate crisis unless it can start to meet together again in person,\" he said.</p><p>\"We really haven't seen a global gathering of anything remotely like this since Davos of January 2020,\" Mr. Smith continued. \"It's about the conversations that we think the world needs to have and this is the best place in the world to have them.\"</p><p>Aaron Tilley</p><p>Jakob Stausholm, CEO of Rio Tinto PLC</p><p>Jakob Stausholm, the chief executive of mining company Rio Tinto PLC, wants to see actions in the short term coming out of COP26, rather than just the longer-term targets that the meeting typically generates.</p><p>Mr. Stausholm will be in Glasgow to meet with government officials.</p><p>\"COP26 is about governmental decisions and people like myself are a side show,\" he said.</p><p>For a company such as Rio Tinto, which operates in 35 countries, getting alignment from governments on future climate-related policy is essential. The more harmony that comes out of Glasgow on government policy, the better, Mr. Stausholm said.</p><p>Mr. Stausholm said he feels a need to be in Scotland because his London-listed company is one of the companies in the U.K. with the biggest carbon footprint globally. Rio Tinto is the world's second-largest miner based on market capitalization.</p><p>\"I hope it goes beyond long-term targets and becomes very practical,\" he said.</p><p>The chief executive said that fighting climate change is about energy transition to less carbon-intensive fuels, which is a very physical transformation and one that needs current investment.</p><p>On Oct. 20, Rio Tinto said it would pull forward an earlier target for a 15% cut in its scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions to 2025 from 2030 and target a 50% cut by 2030. Scope 1 and 2 emissions include those produced by its mining and metals operations, as well as from the generation of purchased energy at those sites. The company said it expects to invest roughly $7.5 billion between 2022 and 2030 to achieve that aim.</p><p>Rio Tinto's shares fell on the news, underlying the potential investor kickback from companies' ambitions on climate change, given the costs it typically brings.</p><p>\"It is not easy for a company to lay out ambitious [capital expenditure] plans, you need to convince the market,\" he said, adding that he also received positive feedback from investors.</p><p>He said Glasgow offers a unique opportunity to meet many people in the same place, which is particularly valuable given ongoing problems with travel during the global pandemic.</p><p>Alistair MacDonald</p><p>Takeshi Niinami, CEO of Suntory Holdings Ltd.</p><p>Takeshi Niinami, chief executive of Japan's Suntory Holdings Ltd., a brewer, soft-drink maker and owner of Jim Beam in the U.S., said he hopes delegates to COP26 respect Asia's circumstances.</p><p>\"Rules are being made with too much focus on the U.S. and Europe,\" Mr. Niinami said. \"I want the delegations at COP26 to understand that the situation differs from country to country, and Asian nations wouldn't be able to follow if they make unreasonable demands.\"</p><p>He added, \"I want the world to understand that we won't be able to solve any problems without the participation of the largest emitter region,\" which is Asia. \"It is very difficult for Asian countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to zero by 2050 by following rules made by Western countries, especially Europe.\"</p><p>Mr. Niinami said that Asian nations are experiencing economic hardship because of the pandemic and haven't been able to have intensive discussions ahead of COP26. He said COP26 is important because it will deter Asian countries from focusing too much on their economic growth and returning to coal fuels.</p><p>He also urged leaders to consider the citation of small Asian companies. Asia is a mecca of supply chains, and there are many small companies that are subject to scope 3 emissions—which refers to greenhouse gases related to a company's products but outside its direct operational control. If these small companies aren't supported, he said, they won't be able to do business with global tech leaders.</p><p>\"Science clearly shows us what to do. So what we need now is technology, application and funding,\" he said.</p><p>\"Asian countries have been really trying, compared to five years ago,\" he added. \"We have to create rules that won't discourage them.\"</p><p>Megumi Fujikawa</p><p>Dirk Van de Put, chief executive of Mondelez International Inc.</p><p>Clear standards and accountability are needed to address climate change, said Mondelez International Inc. Chief Executive Dirk Van de Put, as well as greater clarity for businesses and governments on what is needed to limit the rise in global temperatures.</p><p>The Chicago-based maker of Oreos and Triscuits said it is committing to a 2050 target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain, joining other food companies that have made similar pledges. Mondelez aims to reduce its emissions by sustainably sourcing all the cocoa for its chocolate brands, reducing food waste in manufacturing and distribution and making its biscuit ovens more energy efficient.</p><p>Mr. Van de Put said he hopes COP26 will bring more specifics on actions that must be taken to limit the earth's warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, a goal set by the Paris climate accord. He said clear accounting standards and reporting requirements are needed for companies.</p><p>\"At the moment it is purely voluntary,\" Mr. Van de Put said. \"People can talk about it and say what they're doing, but there is no way that you can really know.\"</p><p>The snack-food giant is dispatching Cathy Pieters, its senior director of sustainable ingredients, to Glasgow for the summit, where she will participate in a panel on the topic of cocoa and forests. Some 70% of Mondelez's carbon emissions come from its ingredients such as cocoa, the production of which has led to deforestation in West Africa, Mr. Van de Put said, so reducing the company's carbon footprint through actions such as encouraging forest conservation and restoration is a priority.</p><p>Mr. Van de Put said that for companies such as Mondelez, socioeconomic efforts, such as boosting farmers' yields and livelihoods, must go hand in hand with carbon-reduction goals.</p><p>\"We cannot just look at this from one angle,\" Mr. Van de Put said. \"We need to work on the whole landscape…and we need to do that across companies and across borders.'</p><p>Jesse Newman</p><p>Jesper Brodin, CEO of Ingka Group, main operating company of family controlled IKEA</p><p>IKEA boss Jesper Brodin says that in a world where consumption isn't going to disappear, finding smarter, more sustainable forms of consumption will be key to achieving the COP summit's goals.</p><p>\"We need to prolong the life-length of products, we need to reduce wasteful consumption,\" said Mr. Brodin, who is the chief executive of Ingka Holding B.V., the holding company which operates most of IKEA's global stores.</p><p>Circularity—the recovery of material from old products for use in new products—is one concept that IKEA will be promoting, he said. IKEA has already adopted the practice with some of its own products, notably mattresses, but aims to do far more. \"There is an ambition for us by 2030 to be only using renewable or recyclable material in each of our products,\" Mr. Brodin said.</p><p>Discussions with governments and companies in Glasgow would help drive circularity and other climate friendly concepts, he said. \"It's absolutely a collective effort that needs to happen for us to resolve this crisis,\" Mr. Brodin said.</p><p>In one example of collective action that Mr. Brodin said would help bring change, IKEA was one of nine companies including Amazon.com Inc. and Unilever PLC that pledged in October to use only zero-carbon shipping by 2040. While IKEA has no direct control over shipping companies, Mr. Brodin said the shipping pledge was a good example of corporate influence being used to help drive change throughout the supply chain, motivating shipping companies to push ahead with promised green investments.</p><p>\"They need to know their buyers are interested,\" he said.</p><p>Trefor Moss</p><p>Ron O'Hanley, chief executive of State Street Corp.</p><p>State Street Corp. is among the biggest of more than 100 money managers that pledged to make their investment portfolios carbon-neutral by 2050.</p><p>Living up to that pledge will be hard, State Street CEO Ron O'Hanley said.</p><p>\"Anybody and everybody who made that commitment should be very concerned about it,\" said Mr. O'Hanley, who plans to attend COP26. \"We have and we're concerned, because it requires data and analytics that historically have not been part of portfolio-construction or performance-measurement activities in the past.\"</p><p>Investors like State Street say they will push the companies they own to reduce their emissions and sell the ones that don't.</p><p>State Street sells services to other money managers and invests itself. To meet their commitments, the company and the rest of the industry are investing in tools that will help them track and score how companies are managing their carbon emissions, he said.</p><p>The company agreed to buy data-management company Mercatus Inc. earlier this year in part to offer its clients information about sustainable investments in private companies and other holdings, he said.</p><p>The process will be costly and complicated until countries and industries coalesce around a set of standards for climate disclosures, said Rick Lacaille, who leads State Street's environmental, social and governance, or ESG, programs.</p><p>That could take five years, Mr. Lacaille predicted.</p><p>Mr. O'Hanley said it is unclear whether pressuring companies or selling their stocks will make a difference.</p><p>\"We should be worried about it as a society,\" he said. \"If we believe we're making progress but it turns out to be just hokum, we ought to know that.\"</p><p>Justin Baer</p><p>Ignacio Galán, chief executive of Iberdrola SA</p><p>Ignacio Galán, the CEO of Spanish utility Iberdrola SA, one of the world's largest producers of renewable energy, said he is hoping COP26 negotiators will agree on a framework for international carbon trading, along with a timeline for phasing out coal.</p><p>He said a European market already functions, and \"if the system works, why have we not extended that one to other countries?\" He said the argument that carbon pricing could hinder economic growth, an argument made by critics of carbon markets, can be put to rest looking at Europe's economic prosperity.</p><p>\"The European economy has grown by 50% and we have reduced emissions by 40%, so I think the system works,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Galán said he is hopeful that governments will agree to a basic framework for the market, especially since more countries, including the U.S., have indicated some support.</p><p>\"On carbon trading I imagine that they are going to reach some kind of agreement, especially because there are many countries which are more and more committed to emissions reductions,\" he said.</p><p>Sarah McFarlane</p><p>Barbara Humpton, CEO of Siemens Corp. (Siemens USA)</p><p>Barbara Humpton, the chief executive of Siemens Corp., said she hopes there will be some global alignment coming out of COP26 so businesses can follow more consistent commitments from governments.</p><p>\"This isn't a case where countries can choose to do things differently; we have to consider the global impact,\" she said. \"We are all at different points along what you call the graph toward a carbon neutral future, and we think everyone needs to be making bold commitments,\" said Ms. Humpton, who leads the U.S. unit of industrial firm Siemens AG in its largest market.</p><p>Ms. Humpton, who will be attending for the first time and among those going on behalf of the global corporation, said Siemens expects much of this work can take at least a decade. Siemens USA, for instance, committed to be carbon neutral by 2030 and recently said it would be net zero by that time frame.</p><p>\"We know in the business community, we understand that business can't get this done alone, government can't get this done alone,\" she said. \"It's going to take all of us.\"</p><p>Ms. Humpton also said she hopes the U.S. will use its infrastructure legislation to spur more action in the global green economy.</p><p>That could benefit Siemens, which recently committed an additional one million electric-vehicle chargers in the U.S. and built an apprenticeship program around that.</p><p>\"Every move along this line around buildings creates job opportunities and is really helping transform toward the future,\" she said.</p><p>Emily Glazer</p><p>Warren East, CEO of Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC</p><p>Warren East, chief executive of aircraft-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC, said he hopes COP26 will inject some urgency into politicians' efforts to tackle climate change, to meet the action being taken by businesses.</p><p>\"We need to see government matching the sort of industrial ambitions that we have with real policy,\" Mr. East said. \"I'm not expecting governments to come out with product strategies—we can do that—but we do need the right policy environment.\"</p><p>The pandemic has been \"a great demonstration of governments around the world being faced with a shock and needing to move from business as usual and react,\" Mr. East said.</p><p>\"Governments and we as a population can learn from the pandemic and, you know, we should probably treat the necessities of responding to climate change as another example and behave in the same way.\"</p><p>Rolls-Royce is currently working on tweaks to its engines so that all of its long-haul aircraft turbines can be powered by sustainable aviation fuels. The company currently powers around 40% of the aircraft flying long-haul routes.</p><p>The company, which is trying to forge a new business developing small modular reactors, also hopes the summit will recognize that nuclear energy will be required to hit climate goals.</p><p>Benjamin Katz</p><p>Paul Knopp, KPMG U.S. chief executive and chair</p><p>When the professional services firm KPMG surveyed more than 1,300 CEOs this summer, three-quarters of respondents said they wanted to see at least one outcome from COP26: greater urgency on climate change.</p><p>Though business leaders have made commitments to cut greenhouse gas emissions, rethink operations and curb business travel, many executives also realize that corporate efforts can achieve only so much on their own, said Paul Knopp, the U.S. chief executive and chair of KPMG LLP.</p><p>\"We cannot get it done by ourselves,\" Mr. Knopp said.</p><p>The key word at the summit should be \"alignment,\" he said. Mr. Knopp wants to see greater cooperation between the U.S. and other countries, and between the public and private sectors, to both set clear goals on reducing emissions, but also to help emerging markets in gaining greater access to technology that will help those countries achieve \"net-zero readiness.\"</p><p>Countries around the world should also come together to set common standards for climate-related financial disclosures, Mr. Knopp said.</p><p>For its part, KPMG last year pledged that it would achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. Many employees at the firm didn't take flights or commute to offices during the pandemic. With more work expected to continue remotely, Mr. Knopp says the firm will likely travel less in the future, though he did not have an exact estimate of how much it could shift.</p><p>\"There's a lot more momentum around climate change than there ever has been in the last 20 years, and maybe ever,\" he says.</p><p>Chip Cutter</p><p>Companies From IKEA to Microsoft Call for Clear Climate Policy as They Head to Glasgow</p>",
