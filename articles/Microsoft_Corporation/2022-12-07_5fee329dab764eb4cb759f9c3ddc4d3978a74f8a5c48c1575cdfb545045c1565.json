  "title": "Democrats' Warnock Wins Tight Georgia Senate Race",
  "text": "<p>The contest was being watched closely by both parties. Tuesday's result offers more clues to Georgia's political direction after a series of hard-fought contests for governor, senator and president in recent election cycles.</p><p>Mr. Warnock's victory means that Democrats will hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate starting in January, slightly increasing their hold on the chamber they have controlled since early 2021, when Mr. Warnock was first elected, along with his Georgia Democratic colleague Sen. Jon Ossoff.</p><p>Democrats will also have control of Senate committees outright and will no longer have to adhere to a power-sharing agreement with the GOP. Mr. Warnock was the first Black senator ever elected from Georgia. His opponent, Mr. Walker, is also Black.</p><p>\"After a hard-fought campaign -- or should I say campaigns -- it is my honor to utter the four most powerful words ever spoken in a democracy: The people have spoken,\" Mr. Warnock said to a cheering crowd at his victory party.</p><p>Mr. Walker conceded the race in brief remarks to supporters, and urged people to continue to vote in elections and support elected officials. He didn't mention Mr. Warnock by name.</p><p>\"There are no excuses in life and I'm not going to make any now because we put up one heck of a fight,\" he said.</p><p>Democrat John Fetterman's victory over Republican Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania in November flipped a GOP seat and gave Democrats control of the chamber with at least a 50-50 party split, thanks to the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris. Mr. Warnock's win gives the Democratic leadership a bit of breathing room and more power.</p><p>Under the current power-sharing agreement, Democrats have been prevented from issuing subpoenas without GOP support. Now, committee chairmen will be able to issue subpoenas and provide a counterbalance to a GOP-led House, which plans aggressive investigations of President Biden, his family and administration.</p><p>Senate committees are currently split evenly, making the process slower for moving Mr. Biden's nominees out of committees and onto the chamber floor. Mr. Warnock's victory will give Democrats a narrow majority on each panel.</p><p>Democrats will also have slightly more flexibility on passing legislation. In the last two years, lawmakers maneuvered partisan bills through the evenly divided Senate, but passing legislation required all Democrats to agree if Republican were united in opposition. That gave leverage to centrist Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who forced the party to make major changes and cuts to its tax, healthcare and climate law originally dubbed Build Back Better. One more seat gives each individual senator less leverage over the agenda.</p><p>Well over 1 million people cast ballots Tuesday as voting went smoothly with few problems across the state, according to Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer of the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, which oversees elections. Election day followed record-breaking early voting in the runoff in which about 1.85 million in-person and mail-in votes had been tallied by Dec. 2, the last day of early voting.</p><p>Mr. Warnock's win comes after four weeks of intense campaigning in the runoff, which was required by Georgia law after neither candidate won more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 8 election. In that contest, a Libertarian won about 2% of the votes cast. Mr. Warnock, a pastor, won slightly more votes than Mr. Walker in November, but less than 50%, forcing the runoff.</p><p>For months polls showed the race close between Mr. Warnock, 53 years old, and Mr. Walker, 60, who was a star player for the University of Georgia and the National Football League.</p><p>Mr. Warnock heavily outspent Mr. Walker, had more paid staff than the Republican and brought in big-name politicians to support him, including former President Barack Obama. Mr. Walker had nationally known Republicans like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham campaigning with him. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who handily won reelection this fall, didn't campaign for Mr. Walker in the general election, but did so in the runoff.</p><p>Even before the runoff, the Georgia Senate race already was one of the most expensive congressional races of all time, with about $250 million spent on political ads by both parties just in the general election.</p><p>Georgia's roughly 11 million residents were subjected to a tsunami of political ads, flyers in their mailboxes and volunteers knocking on their doors. Ads for the race took a sharply negative tone, with the campaigns and groups supporting them blasting the candidates over allegations of mistreating women, past statements and other issues.</p><p>Runoffs are not uncommon in Georgia elections. That is how Mr. Warnock was elected in 2021.</p><p>In Social Circle, a town in rural Walton County, Clyde Mitchell, a 69-year-old retired small-business owner, spent a few minutes at a community center voting for Mr. Walker. Walton County voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Walker on Nov. 8, and he would have needed a strong turnout here and in other rural areas to counter votes from Democratic strongholds in metro Atlanta.</p><p>\"I'd hate to see another six years with the Democrats in control,\" Mr. Mitchell said, referring to the length of the next senator's term. Mr. Mitchell said a key issue for him is stopping illegal immigration, and he believed Mr. Walker would work to do that.</p><p>In Conyers, Ga., Darryl Jenkins, 57, who is retired from the Army, spent several minutes in a church to cast his ballot for Mr. Warnock. Rockdale County, where Conyers is located, voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Warnock in November.</p><p>\"The Republican Party right now is just a lot of divisiveness,\" Mr. Jenkins said, adding that he felt Mr. Walker, who has never held office before, would just be \"somebody's puppet\" if elected.</p><p>Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump both backed their candidates on the day before the runoff election.</p><p>In a Monday interview with an Atlanta radio station, Mr. Biden said getting out to vote for Mr. Warnock \"is critical because, look, all the things that Reverend Warnock has supported are things that the people of Georgia care a great deal about.\" He cited Mr. Warnock's efforts to cut healthcare costs.</p><p>Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social, a Trump-backed social-media platform, that he urged \"all MAGA Voters\" to back Mr. Walker. \"Herschel was a Great Athlete, and he will be an even greater United States Senator!\" he posted.</p>",
