  "text": "<p>The blockbuster domestic listing of Indonesian ecommerce group Bukalapak has prompted other start-ups in the country to abandon plans for overseas share offerings in favour of going local, signalling a payday for their foreign backers.</p> <p>International investor interest in Indonesia's tech sector has surged, with group's including Facebook, Microsoft, Tencent, Alibaba, Google and private equity firms KKR and Warburg Pincus <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bcc935fd-ef40-4d6d-9939-ea18498e0283\">piling into local start-ups</a>. </p> <p>South-east Asia's biggest economy, Indonesia has the region's largest crop of unicorns, or privately held start-ups, valued at more than $1bn.</p> <p>Until <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8095f4c3-76e0-40a8-8c75-0dcf68eb9fae\">Bukalapak's $1.5bn listing</a> in August, however, none had successfully listed on a stock market, a crucial step in the start-up lifecycle for global investors.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now, other Indonesian tech groups are considering the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) as a credible alternative to international initial public offerings. Conglomerate MNC Group, founded by billionaire <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a209df92-dc8b-11e6-9d7c-be108f1c1dce\">Hary Tanoesoedibjo</a>, has dropped a plan to list its video-streaming service in the US through a merger with a blank-cheque vehicle this month.</p> <p>“When you get an exit like that [Bukalapak], it gets the attention of later-stage funds,” said William Bao Bean, general partner at global venture capital fund SOSV. “Not only that it was a successful one and it has fired the starting gun, [but] we should [also] see a funding surge going into the market from international investors.”&#xa0;</p> <p>The IDX has sought to attract more tech names though the introduction of regulations to accommodate the sector, such as dual-class shares that would give founders and existing shareholders more control of their companies. </p> <p>Bukalapak, an online marketplace backed by Microsoft, Chinese billionaire Jack Ma's fintech company Ant Group and Singapore's sovereign fund GIC, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/daee505b-9964-4609-9226-7861fd473e19\">upsized</a> its IPO from an initial target of $300m to $1.5bn, which made it the country's biggest-ever stock market listing.</p> <p>The debut buoyed the prospects of other tech companies set to go public in Indonesia. GoTo, a “super app” that offers ecommerce, ride-hailing, delivery and payments services, is planning a dual listing in Indonesia and the US targeting a market valuation of more than $40bn.</p> <p>GoTo's backers include Tencent, Google, SoftBank, Alibaba, Visa and Warburg Pincus.</p> <p>Raghav Maliah, global vice-chair of investment banking at Goldman Sachs, said Indonesia had the “largest addressable market” and was at the forefront of demand from global investors.</p> <p>Barrett Comiskey, chief executive of Migo, a start-up that allows consumers to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67c185fa-0644-4761-b582-20a234712082\">download movies</a> and television shows to their mobile phones via a machine installed at convenience stores, said an onshore listing made “a lot of sense” in the wake of Bukalapak's IPO.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Our blue-chip investors have always encouraged us to go to the market where the investor base best understands,” he said. Migo's investors include Singaporean state investment fund Temasek and YouTube co-founder Steve Chen.&#xa0;</p> <p>MNC Group this month terminated an agreement to merge its subsidiary Asia Vision Network, the holding company for local streaming platform Vision+, with Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company Malacca Straits Acquisition Company. MNC cited “increasing enthusiasm of investors in the IDX” for digital companies.&#xa0;</p> <p>Willson Cuaca, co-founder of heavily Indonesia-focused venture capital firm East Ventures, said a number of his portfolio companies were considering share sales in the country.&#xa0;</p> <p>“It's about scarcity value; there are not many public tech companies listed in Indonesia,” he said. </p> <p>However, Indonesia still has some way to go to catch the US or other markets in demand for tech start-ups. </p> <p>The IDX ranks 23rd in the world in terms of the market capitalisation of its listed companies at about $500bn, trailing Singapore and Thailand in the region, according to World Bank data. Trading is also still primarily retail-driven, which makes share prices volatile. </p> <p>“There is still a lack of institutional investors providing stability, though that could change if we get a string of successful IPOs,” said Hwee Ang, founder of financial advisory group Anagram Advisors. </p> <p>Political risks are another issue, she added. “There is always a question of government longevity in south-east Asian countries, and how policies could change.”</p> <p>And while Bukalapak rose sharply on its trading debut, its stock has since drifted back down to near its IPO price. </p> <p>Last month the parent of Kredivo, the Indonesian “buy now, pay later” app, agreed to go public via a $2.5bn merger with a Nasdaq-listed Spac.&#xa0;</p> <p>While Kredivo had not planned on pursuing a US IPO, founder Akshay Garg said: “We think it's always better, as a strategy, to do a listing in the deepest possible capital market, and that's [the] US.”</p><p>Source: Mercedes Ruehl in Singapore 2021 'Indonesian tech start-ups abandon US Spac deal plans in favour of going local' FT.com 26 September.
