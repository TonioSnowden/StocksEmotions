  "text": "<p>\"I never thought I'd leave,\" she said.</p><p>Ms. Boler Davis was the most senior Black executive in the automotive industry, but she started to have a nagging feeling that to continue growing, she had to move beyond the company she had called home for most of her career.</p><p>In 2019, she joined Amazon.com Inc. as vice president of customer fulfillment, quickly being promoted to join then-CEO Jeff Bezos' most senior group of advisers, called the \"S-Team,\" and elevated to senior vice president.</p><p>Less than a year after she joined Amazon, the coronavirus set in. Ms. Boler Davis was faced with a rapidly shifting pandemic that affected the company's hundreds of thousands of employees.</p><p>In early 2022, Ms. Boler Davis says she started to consider the next five years of her career. An executive recruiter called her about digital pharmacy startup Alto Pharmacy. She hadn't heard of the company until that phone call. But, after meeting with Alto's founders -- two former Facebook employees who wanted to disrupt the pharmaceutical industry -- she said she came to believe in the seven-year-old company's mission.</p><p>In September, she started as CEO of Alto, a \"unicorn\" -- or startup valued at $1 billion or more -- that counts SoftBank Vision Fund as an investor and competes with the likes of Capsule, Walgreens and even Amazon Pharmacy.</p><p>\"This isn't a Fortune 500 CEO job, which was probably the expected thing for me to do,\" said Ms. Boler Davis, who was interviewing for such roles when Alto approached her. \"I've never done what was expected.\"</p><p>Here are four of her most trusted advisers.</p><p>Bill Boggs</p><p>Retired GM executive</p><p>Ms. Boler Davis met Mr. Boggs in 1999, when she was working as a plant planner at a troubled GM plant. Mr. Boggs was brought in from Ford Motor Co. to turn the plant around.Over the decade Ms. Boler Davis worked for him, Mr. Boggs promoted her a number of times, sometimes just a few months after a previous promotion. In 2007, he promoted her to plant manager of one of GM's most important plants.Ms. Boler Davis said she learned about recognizing talent and placing bets on talent from Mr. Boggs, who also backed and promoted other women at GM.</p><p>Ben Slivka</p><p>Angel investor, Retired Microsoft and Amazon executive</p><p>Ms. Boler Davis met Mr. Slivka in 2014 when she gave the keynote address at Northwestern University's graduation ceremony for engineers. At the time, Mr. Slivka was on the board of trustees, which Ms. Boler Davis would later join. Since that meeting, Mr. Slivka has pushed her to move beyond her comfort zone, she said. In 2018, she started to feel she was too comfortable at GM. Mr. Slivka introduced Ms. Boler Davis to a friend: then-Amazon Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke.She says she likely wouldn't have ended up at Amazon if not for Mr. Slivka pushing her.</p><p>Patti Poppe</p><p>CEO, PG&amp;E Corp.</p><p>Ms. Boler Davis met Ms. Poppe in 1998 when she was assigned to work in a GM plant where Ms. Poppe was a leader.\"What I learned from her is about leading with empathy, and about building a team piece by piece,\" said Ms. Boler Davis. She recalls Ms. Poppe being tough, but also being empathetic and having fun. Ms. Boler Davis has relied on Ms. Poppe for all types of advice. \"I also learned from her taking risks in her career,\" said Ms. Boler Davis, who followed the way Ms. Poppe took her own risk when she left a senior role at GM in 2005 to join the energy industry.</p><p>Kevin Williams</p><p>CEO, GAA Manufacturing and Supply Chain Management</p><p>Ms. Boler Davis's first interaction with Mr. Williams was an unsolicited phone call from the then-GM executive early in her career. \"He said 'Hey Alicia, I'm Kevin Williams. You don't know me; I know you. I've been following your career, I just want to be a resource for you to help you along your journey,\" she recalls. Over the years, the two have had regular check-ins. Mr. Williams used to say \"excellence ain't easy,\" but impressed upon her that she had to continually raise the bar for herself.Ms. Boler Davis has adopted the practice of calling talented employees out of the blue to offer mentorship.</p>",
