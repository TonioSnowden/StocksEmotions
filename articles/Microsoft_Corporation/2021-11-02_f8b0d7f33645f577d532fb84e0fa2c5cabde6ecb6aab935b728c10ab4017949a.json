  "title": "Businesses Lease Trophy Space to Stoke Return to the Office; Rents for elite buildings full of amenities are getting steeper; 'The top of the top has just gone crazy'",
  "text": "<p>These new office digs offer custom-built lounges, game rooms with ping-pong tables and foosball, and apps that enable employees to contact building security or order a burger from the company cafeteria. The state-of-the art office towers also emphasize sanitation, outdoor space and sustainability, featuring robust ventilation systems and outside dining areas with fire pits.</p><p>Many firms are swallowing hard while paying the steeper rents that accompany all these extras. But they believe the costs are necessary to draw employees back into offices and to help recruit and retain talent in a tight labor market.</p><p>\"It's all about how do we as landlords create an environment that gives their tenants and their employees no excuses not to show up,\" said Jeff Eckert, the head of JLL's U.S. office landlord representation business.</p><p>The flight to quality in the office market has widened to record levels the difference between rents being paid for top-tier space and run-of-the-mill space.</p><p>In October, the cost of effective rents under negotiation by owners of the top 10% of U.S. office buildings was 54% higher than for the rest of the market, according to data firm VTS. Effective rents take into account factors such as free rent concessions and the cost of building interior space.</p><p>That premium between elite buildings and the rest has never been greater in the years since 2012, when VTS began tracking this data. In both 2018 and 2019 the difference in rents between the trophy and the ordinary came to 43%, VTS said. The firm tracks deals being negotiated in more than 3.5 billion square feet of U.S. office space.</p><p>\"The top of the top has just gone crazy,\" said Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive for the New York region at real-estate firm CBRE Group Inc.</p><p>The search for amenity-rich headquarters is a big reason why the office leasing market, which was moribund during much of the pandemic, is starting to rebound as Covid-19 infection rates fall and employees feel more relaxed about populated workspaces.</p><p>Venable LLP is among those signing up for more attractive space. The law firm signed a New York City lease last month for five floors in an overhauled Times Square office tower. Its new space boasts a private balcony overlooking the Empire State Building in a building with an updated Frank Gehry-designed cafeteria, with a menu overseen by star chef Charlie Palmer.</p><p>Venable considered staying in place at the Rockefeller Center, but it opted for the shiny new space to consolidate offices from two locations and because the firm is more concerned about getting employees back than with cutting costs, said Chairman Stu Ingis. </p><p>Law firm Venable LLP opted to relocate to newly built space in Manhattan partly to help persuade workers to return to the office.

Overall, the office vacancy rate is at 16.8%, the highest since 2010, according to CBRE.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Is your company setting up new offices as a result of the pandemic? How does the new space compare to the former one? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Tenants looking for discounts can find plenty of opportunities on the sublease market, where the volume of available space is at an 18-year high, according to CBRE. Event management firm Eventbrite Inc. agreed to pay about $65 a square foot to sublease in San Francisco earlier this year when it downsized its headquarters. That is more than $20 a square foot less than what comparable space would have rented for before the pandemic if leased directly from a landlord, brokers say.</p><p>Landlords that control the top buildings, meanwhile, have been better able to hold the line on pricing. In New York, SL Green Realty Corp. has leased more than 90% of its new $3 billion office tower overlooking Grand Central Terminal, despite charging top-of-the-market average rents of $150 to $325 a square foot.</p><p>In Miami, the developer of a high-end 55-story tower known as 830 Brickell has increased asking rents by 23% compared with the days before the pandemic, said JLL, after signing up blue-chip names like Microsoft Corp. and private-equity firm Thoma Bravo.</p><p>\"In 20 years of doing this, this has been the first cycle we've seen anything like this,\" said Steven Hurwitz, head of office landlord representation for JLL in the Miami area.</p><p>Write to Peter Grant at peter.grant@wsj.com</p><p>Businesses Lease Trophy Space to Stoke Return to the Office</p>",
