  "text": "<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 92.37, or 0.8%, to 11360.05. The technology-heavy index closed lower after rising at least 1% intraday for the 13th time this year, which happened only twice in 2021.</p><p>Big financial firms kicked off a bumper week of earnings reports Monday. Goldman Sachs gained $7.39, or 2.5%, to $301.26 after reporting better-than-expected earnings. Synchrony Financial, which reported earnings per share that fell year over year but were better than analysts expected, gained 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $31.48.</p><p>Bank of America finished up 1 cent, or less than 1%, after it said second-quarter profits declined 32%. Charles Schwab, which reported second-quarter profits rose by 42%, lost 94 cents, or 1.5%, to $61.24.</p><p>\"There's been a couple of pleasant surprises in earnings,\" said Faron Daugs, chief executive of Harrison Wallace Financial Group, of the latest earnings reports from financial companies.</p><p>Some traders attributed the afternoon's market dip to a report that Apple plans to slow its hiring next year, news that was first reported by Bloomberg and which weighed on tech shares. The tech giant lost $3.10, or 2.1%, to $147.07. The S&amp;P's tech segment shed 1%.</p><p>\"That's some heavy weight for the market to bear,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. \"These are market leaders. These are also companies that set the high end of the pay scale.\"</p><p>Investors are trying to reconcile a dire economic outlook with earnings forecasts that remain relatively positive. Economic growth is showing signs of slowing while inflation is soaring, last week reaching a four-decade high. Meanwhile, central banks are raising interest rates rapidly, adding another cloud on the economy's horizon. So far, corporate reports have been lackluster.</p><p>\"Either the economic story is wrong or analysts are being too optimistic on earnings, and it feels like the latter,\" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street Global Advisors. \"If you scrape the text of company earnings announcements, many are complaining.\"</p><p>Other companies due to report this week include Johnson &amp; Johnson on Tuesday, Tesla on Wednesday and Twitter on Friday.</p><p>Among other tech giants, Google parent Alphabet fell $2.75, or 2.5%, to $109.03. The company's shares split 20-for-1 after Friday's close. Microsoft lost $2.47, or 1%, to $254.25.</p><p>\"We believe growth is performing a floor here, and this would be mostly the technology sector, but even broader than that,\" said Ivana Delevska, founder and chief executive of SPEAR Invest, a firm focused on industrial technology companies.</p><p>Fresh data from the National Association of Home Builders showed that an index of confidence among U.S. home builders fell 12 points to 55 in July. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a seventh consecutive monthly decline, but also a stronger reading.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.959% from 2.929% on Friday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>The European Central Bank is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in 11 years at a meeting Thursday. The region's economy is feeling the effects of the war in Ukraine and an energy crisis more acutely than other economies. The Bank of Japan is expected to buck the trend among global central banks and keep rates unchanged on Thursday.</p><p>The Federal Reserve has signaled it will raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point for the second time in a row later this month.</p><p>\"I don't see this volatility ending until the Fed at least takes its foot off the brake,\" said Mr. Sosnick, of Interactive Brokers.</p><p>Commodity prices rebounded following a stretch of weakness. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 5.1% to $106.27 a barrel. Copper rose 3.5%, while gold advanced 0.4%.</p><p>Overseas, global markets were higher across the board. In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 finished up 0.9%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index jumped 2.7% while in mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.6%. Markets in Japan were closed for a holiday.</p><p>Write to Pia Singh at Pia.Singh@wsj.com and Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Lose Ground as Banks Give Quarterly Updates</p>",
