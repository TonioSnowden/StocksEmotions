  "text": "<p>   When Microsoft first started testing the service in 2017, the company zip-tied racks of Xbox 360 consoles to metal frames inside some of its massive data centers. The setup has evolved since then. Now, it uses specialized circuit boards sitting inside these data centers, which are essentially the innards of the Xbox. Microsoft says the cloud Xboxes are able to run faster in the data centers than in people's homes because of the way they are cooled. </p><p>   Mr. Spencer started pursuing more acquisitions as it needed original content to entice gamers to its subscription platform. By last year it owned a total of 23 studios. </p><p>   Mr. Spencer's opportunity to buy Activision, one of the largest gaming companies, arose late last year. Federal regulators were investigating the company over how it handled employees' allegations of sexual misconduct and workplace discrimination, and The Wall Street Journal reported that Activision CEO Bobby Kotick had mishandled sexual-misconduct allegations. Activision's share price tumbled nearly 30% between July, when the first regulatory investigation was made public and when the Microsoft deal was announced, making it a ripe acquisition target. </p><p>   In response to the troubling revelations about Activision, Mr. Spencer sent a letter to Microsoft employees saying Microsoft was re-evaluating its relationship with the game company. At around the same time, however, he reached out to Mr. Kotick, whom he had known for years, starting a two-month conversation that culminated in Microsoft's $75 billion offer last month, the Journal reported. </p><p>   Mr. Spencer now faces the task of integrating a company that is still reeling from allegations of a toxic workplace culture. Where Microsoft has usually taken a hands-off approach with companies it acquires, analysts say, Activision may need more hand-holding. </p><p>   Mr. Spencer said he is confident that Activision management is addressing the workplace issues. </p><p>   \"We see the progress that they are making, that was pretty fundamental to us deciding to go forward here,\" he said. </p><p>   If the Activision deal closes, Mr. Spencer's group will control 30 studios, pushing the company closer to becoming the \"Netflix for gaming.\" </p><p>   \"Phil has been systematically putting the building blocks in place,\" said S. Somasegar, a more than 25-year veteran of Microsoft who left in 2015. \"He's got enough now to take the next big step with Activision.\" </p><p></p>",
