  "title": "PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY:  Tame Your Swarm  Of Subscriptions  ----  By Nicole Nguyen",
  "text": "<p>\n  Music streaming. Video streaming. Live-TV streaming. News. Cloud storage. Fitness app. Dog treat box. App that tells me when to fertilize my plants. </p><p>\n  It seems like most things we want now require us to pay a subscription. </p><p>\n  According to a Deloitte survey, the average American subscribed to 12 paid media and entertainment services pre-pandemic. Among those ages 25 to 40, who averaged 17 subscriptions, 40% reported feeling overwhelmed by the number of their subscriptions and intend to reduce them. </p><p>\n  These subscriptions add up over the long run. In researching my costs for this column, I learned I would pay nearly $540 for HBO Now over the next three years. </p><p>\n  Recurring revenue helps small companies stay solvent -- and it amounts to big bucks for larger firms. That's why so many businesses are drawn to the model, said Steve Tadelis, an economics professor at University of California, Berkeley's Haas School of Business. Plus, firms can take advantage of lazy unsubscribers, he said. A CreditCards.com poll found 48% of respondents said they forgot to cancel a free trial before being an automatic renewal. </p><p>\n  For all those subscriptions you aren't as happy about, here are ways to track them down and avoid overpaying. </p><p>\n  Audit your subscriptions. You can calculate how much you spend on subscriptions by itemizing them in a spreadsheet -- or use an app that crunches numbers for you. TrackMySubs and Bobby are well-designed management tools but limit the number of subscriptions you can add before charging their own monthly fee. Subby is a good free Android option offering unlimited subscriptions. </p><p>\n  There are apps that ingest your banking and credit-card information and scour the data for bills. Mint, the budgeting software from Intuit, recently rolled out an automated subscription finder for its iOS app (available on Android soon), but it only tracks monthly recurring fees. Trim and Truebill not only identify recurring charges, monthly and annual, they can negotiate those bills down -- but keep a cut of the savings and offer upsell premium plans. </p><p>\n  Truebill was best at identifying my subscriptions. Just note, these services require your financial-account credentials, which are authenticated through a third-party service called Plaid. A Plaid spokeswoman said it doesn't share your financial-institution username and password with the apps you're using. </p><p>\n  -- Check your app store for forgotten subscriptions. iPhone users: Open Settings, tap your name and then Subscriptions. Android users: Go to the Play Store, tap Menu and select Subscriptions. On Amazon, go to your Account and click Memberships and Subscriptions. </p><p>\n  -- Search your inbox. Use queries like \"subscription,\" \"payment,\" \"confirmation\" and \"order\" to find emailed invoices. </p><p>\n  -- Restrict in-app purchases for shared devices. If you share a device with children, or they're part of a family plan, this will help prevent surprise charges. </p><p>\n  -- Disable auto-renewal for services. Add reminders to your calendar to re-subscribe so you're forced to opt back in every month or year. </p><p>\n  -- Check for a one-time pay option. For example, Microsoft offers Office 2019 to home users for a flat $150. Otherwise, you'd need a Microsoft 365 subscription, which typically starts at $7 a month. There are caveats: It's limited to one Mac or PC computer, and doesn't come with Microsoft 365's cloud storage or collaboration features. </p><p>\n  -- If there's a free trial, cancel right away. That way, you won't get charged if you forget. </p><p>\n  -- The service may offer a good deal to convince you to stay. In researching this column, I discovered a few services on my credit-card bill that I thought were a little too pricey. After I hit the cancel button, three proposed discounted rates that were too good to refuse -- so I continued my subscriptions. For now. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  One-Time Fee </p><p>\n  Holdout Has a Plea </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  I lament the days of one-time fees. In 2011, I signed up for Pinboard, an ad-free bookmarking site with an emphasis on speed, for $9.33. I felt some pride when the site started charging a subscription fee to new users in 2015. </p><p>\n  Last week, the site's founder and sole engineer, Maciej Ceglowski, laid out a plea to Pinboard old-timers like me: Voluntarily convert your account to subscription to keep the site running. I called Mr. Ceglowski to ask him about the email-- and what subscription-fearing users like me should know about the costs developers face. </p><p>\n  \"I'm like a guy that owns a storage unit. You rent from me, and my job is to make sure nobody breaks in, and your stuff is there whenever you come back for it,\" he said. His role is largely custodial, he said, which includes keeping the server hardware running and writing all of its code. Mr. Ceglowski added new features over the years, including the ability to archive bookmarked pages that might go offline. More subscribers, paying $22 a year, would allow him to hire an engineer to help with upkeep of the growing site. </p><p>\n  Mr. Ceglowski said some of the old-timers who agreed to convert their accounts opted for a 10-year, $109 plan. It's another one-time payment of sorts, just a lot bigger. </p><p></p>",
