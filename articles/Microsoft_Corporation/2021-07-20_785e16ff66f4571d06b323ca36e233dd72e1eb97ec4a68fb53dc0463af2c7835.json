  "text": "<p>Joe Biden will nominate Jonathan Kanter, who has represented some of Google's fiercest rivals, as one of his administration's top competition law enforcers, raising another potential challenge to Silicon Valley's largest companies.</p> <p>If confirmed as head of the US justice department's antitrust division, Kanter will take over responsibility for the government's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8b2def2-0cb0-4a2d-941d-b965f6037dbb\">antitrust case</a> against Google. </p> <p>Kanter has previously represented several companies that have complained about Google's anti-competitive practices, including Microsoft and News Corp. Google declined to comment.</p> <p>The nomination was a further sign of Biden's intent to reshape the way competition law is enforced in the US. It followed the appointments of two prominent Big Tech critics, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bee1b959-b2aa-4ee1-8391-d5b5832ededd\">Lina Khan</a> and Tim Wu, as chair of the Federal Trade Commission and a White House adviser, respectively.</p> <p>“Jonathan Kanter is a distinguished antitrust lawyer with over 20 years of experience,” the White House said in a statement on Tuesday announcing the intended nomination. “Throughout his career, Kanter has also been a leading advocate and expert in the effort to promote strong and meaningful antitrust enforcement and competition policy.”</p> <p>Kanter, the founding partner at boutique antitrust firm The Kanter Law Group, did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>His appointment would install another high-profile tech critic in charge of enforcing federal antitrust laws, alongside <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57cd6686-d1ee-4321-ae35-a8e1fc7f0813\">Khan</a>, whose pointed criticism of Amazon and Facebook led those companies to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f7e7e02-82e0-430d-b923-b0a0c4ab50c4\">request her recusal</a> from cases involving them. </p> <p>Kanter had been seen as the more progressive of the two candidates reportedly on the president's shortlist for the justice department antitrust job. Jonathan Sallet, the other, may have faced fewer potential conflicts of interest given Kanter's previous client list. But he was not championed by those on the left of the Democratic party who have urged a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2db2f9d4-7a91-476b-bb22-d0a7cf0d4805\">rethink of antitrust policy</a>.</p> <p>The nomination was another sign of the growing power of a handful of progressive academics, lawyers and campaigners who argue that US competition law has not been properly enforced for decades.</p> <p>One of those academics is Wu, the architect of this month's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c207e1c4-8978-4482-8b4d-c353acce33d1\">presidential order</a> on competition, which aimed to tackle concentrations of power across the US economy.</p> <p>Before Kanter's appointment, progressive activists tweeted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lutherlowe/status/1385646706344275968\">a picture</a> of a mug on which was written: “Wu &amp; Khan &amp; Kanter”.</p> <p>Elizabeth Warren, Democratic Senator from Massachusetts, said in a statement that Kanter “will reinvigorate antitrust enforcement — both civil and criminal — and strengthen the DoJ's scrutiny of the anti-competitive abuses that threaten our economy, our society, and our democracy”.</p><p>Source: Kiran Stacey in Washington 2021 'Biden nominates Google critic to lead DoJ antitrust division' FT.com 20 July.
