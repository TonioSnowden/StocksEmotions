  "text": "<p>Some of this is driven by the Federal Reserve. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed this week that the quantitative-easing program would be tapered, cutting back bond purchases. (The move had little effect on the day, as it had been so widely signaled.) The Bank of England's talk of rate increases, along with Canada's and Australia's central banks pulling back from efforts to hold down long-term bond yields, also pushed investors to rethink government bonds.</p><p>There are several explanations for why other markets don't much care about the swings in bond yields, but none is totally satisfactory.</p><p>The simplest is that the moves of the past month were largely technical. Short-dated government bonds sold off hard, led by the U.K. and Canada. Their two-year yields were up about half a percentage point from the start of last month to Wednesday night, their biggest moves over a month since 2011 and 2008, respectively. The U.S. yield is up only 0.19 percentage point, but that's still the biggest rise over such a period since before the pandemic. Yields even rose a little in Japan's stagnant bond markets.</p><p>The trigger for the moves was a shift in expectations for rate increases. But the speed and size of the moves might have been magnified by forced selling from leveraged hedge funds caught off guard.</p><p>If shareholders and currency traders thought the bond moves were mostly noise, it makes sense to ignore them. The Bank of England ended up voting against the expected rate increase on Thursday and gilt yields promptly retreated. Even before the BoE's surprise, yields had come back down a lot in Germany this week and a little in the U.S., supporting the idea that they had overshot.</p><p>Other bonds suggest that the direction, if not perhaps the speed, had more to do with changes that matter.</p><p>Longer-dated bond yields rose much less than the 2-year, and the longest maturity yields actually fell everywhere. This is exactly what should be expected if investors think central banks are tightening early in the inflation cycle: More now means less is needed later. At the longest end, 30-year, 50-year and even Austria's 100-year bond yields are down, showing no fear of a slide into a wage-price spiral of the type that led to sustained inflation in the 1970s.</p><p>The fall in the longest-dated yields is good for the longest-dated stocks, growth businesses whose shareholders pin their hopes on profits expanding far in the future. And growth stocks -- including solid earners such as Microsoft and those with minimal earnings today, such as Tesla -- did particularly well as the longest-dated yields fell.</p><p>It wasn't just growth stocks that performed well, though, so this explanation alone doesn't solve the puzzle. More than 80% of the S&amp;P 500 was up, and cheap value stocks, which are much less sensitive to long-dated yields, also rose strongly, albeit by less than growth.</p><p>It could just be that shareholders were focused on the blowout earnings season, when profits proved more resilient to supply disruptions and labor shortages than investors expected. It wouldn't explain, however, why currencies didn't swing. Usually shifting bond yields attracts money across borders.</p><p>A bearish interpretation is that the vast infusion of money by governments and central banks into the economy has anesthetized investors. Outbreaks of volatility in particular assets don't spread, because there is so much money around that damps down any moves.</p><p>This would be worrying, as once those excess savings are spent, there could be painful reversion in complacent and overvalued stock markets.</p><p>The bullish story is that bond moves reflect merely the expectations that central banks will have to raise rates to keep up with inflation, not to slow the economy.</p><p>It is interest rates that take into account inflation that determine whether monetary policy is tight or easy, so rising inflation has created hidden monetary stimulus. Treasurys may be pricing in higher rates earlier than before, but after-inflation yields on Treasury inflation-protected securities -- as well as British inflation-linked gilts -- actually fell last month. If investors truly believed that central banks were trying to slow the economy, these real yields should be rising.</p><p>Luckily for the Fed, the bond markets haven't lost faith in its desire or ability to keep inflation under control in the long run. Inflation may be less transitory than the Fed thought, but market measures of long-term inflation expectations -- from five years to 10 years ahead -- show a fall back to the Fed's 2% average target.</p><p>If that changes, expect investors everywhere to sit up and take notice.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
