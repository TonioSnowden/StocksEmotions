  "text": "<p>   A foundation for CBS founder William Paley has started selling off a trove of masterpieces long lent to New York's Museum of Modern Art to fund an expansion of the museum's digital footprint -- including a Pablo Picasso that sold Monday for $37.1 million. </p><p>   The sale at Sotheby's landed a week after Christie's made auction history selling Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's $1.5 billion art estate. While Mr. Allen's art stirred up a marketing bonanza, collectors and dealers say they will be seeking clues about the market's broader strength during these remaining sales in New York's fall series. </p><p>   While Sotheby's evening sale on Monday totaled $392 million -- one of its highest tallies -- a few unsold works by artists including Edgar Degas and Andre Derain sapped some energy from Sotheby's Manhattan saleroom. </p><p>   Mr. Paley's cubist Picasso from 1919, \"Guitar on a Table,\" was one of a couple dozen works at Sotheby's put into MoMA's care after the television pioneer died in 1990. The foundation said it decided to sell the art to raise roughly $70 million for several charitable causes, including helping the museum expand its digital footprint. </p><p>   The yellow, pink and teal Picasso, which Mr. Paley bought as a young collector in 1946, had been expected to sell for at least $20 million. Two bidders on Monday wound up competing for it, pushing the price of the kaleidoscopic tablescape higher. A telephone bidder won the work. </p><p>   Other pieces from Mr. Paley's estate up for bid on Monday included Joan Miro's 1949 abstract \"Painting,\" which sold for $1.4 million, over its $700,000 to $1 million estimate. </p><p>   Last month in London, Sotheby's helped the foundation sell Mr. Paley's Francis Bacon from 1963, \"Three Studies for Portrait of Henrietta Moraes,\" for $27 million. </p><p>   Ahead of the sale, MoMA Director Glenn Lowry said the museum wants to use its proceeds to possibly launch its own art-related streaming channel and possibly team up with a university to offer degrees in art fields. \"We need to increase our capacity off-site and online,\" Mr. Lowry said. </p><p>   Elsewhere in Sotheby's sale, Piet Mondrian's \"Composition II\" sold for $51 million, establishing a new record for the artist. The grid-like piece from 1930 was estimated to sell for around $50 million. </p><p></p>",
