  "text": "<p>\"We've been exploring how to build an Edit feature in a safe manner since last year and plan to begin testing it within @TwitterBlue Labs in the coming months,\" Twitter's head of consumer product Jay Sullivan said in a tweet on Tuesday.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you think Twitter should add an edit feature? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The edit function has been one of the most requested features among Twitter users for some time, the company said.</p><p>\"People want to be able to fix (sometimes embarrassing) mistakes, typos and hot takes in the moment,\" Mr. Sullivan said. The company was aware such a function could be misused, he said.</p><p>\"Without things like time limits, controls, and transparency about what has been edited, Edit could be misused to alter the record of the public conversation. Protecting the integrity of that public conversation is our top priority when we approach this work,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Musk's poll attracted 4.4 million votes. Twitter's communications team denied that the move was related to the poll, but Parag Agrawal, the company's chief executive, retweeted it, saying \"The consequences of this poll will be important. Please vote carefully.\"</p><p>On Monday, Mr. Musk, who has been a longtime critic of Twitter, disclosed a large stake in the company, making him one of its biggest shareholders.</p><p>The surprise move sent Twitter's stock up 27%, its largest one-day percentage gain on record. Still, little is known about Mr. Musk's intentions. He has previously reveled in the attention from his more than 80 million Twitter followers, and criticized the service broadly.</p><p>The company later said it would appoint him to its board, bringing the billionaire social-media agitator inside the fold.</p><p>The outspoken entrepreneur hasn't been shy about questioning Twitter's values. In recent weeks he has mused publicly about its commitment to free speech and has said he was considering starting a rival social-media platform of his own.</p><p>\"Free speech is essential to a functioning democracy,\" Mr. Musk said in a tweet last month. \"Do you believe Twitter rigorously adheres to this principle?\" In the accompanying poll, 70% of the more than two million respondents voted no.</p><p>\"He's both a passionate believer and intense critic of the service which is exactly what we need on @Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long-term. Welcome Elon!\" Mr. Agrawal said after the news was announced.</p><p>Twitter's consideration of an edit button comes as other prominent social-media companies, including Meta Platforms Inc.'s Facebook and Instagram, allow users to change their posts.</p><p>Instagram allows users to edit the captions of existing posts. When posts are changed, they may be labeled as edited.</p><p>Facebook allows posts to be edited as well but doesn't label them as edited. If a post has been edited, users can click on the post to view the post's edit history.</p><p>LinkedIn Corp. also allows users toedit the texts of shared posts. It labels any posts that have been changed as edited.</p><p>Ari Lightman, professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College, said an edit feature will change the nature of Twitter.</p><p>\"It's good for the brand in terms of innovation, in terms of credibility and in terms of staying relevant with what consumers want,\" Mr. Lightman said. \"Could it be damaging? Absolutely, if it's not done correctly.\"</p><p>Fiery tweets fired off in the heat of the moment will be able to be toned down and users will be able to scrub inappropriate posts from their teen years, he said. But without proper precautions from Twitter, public figures like politicians could potentially alter statements they have made in the past to change their positions on issues, hide facts or even change incriminating information, Mr. Lightman said.</p><p>A politician or celebrity \"changing a tweet without complete transparency that they've changed the tweet might become problematic,\" Mr. Lightman said.</p><p>Reactions to the edit button were mixed on Twitter, with many users questioning the impact such a function could have for credibility and overall discourse on the platform.</p><p>\"Unpopular opinion, I know, but I don't want Twitter to add an edit button feature. I think it will likely make Twitter worse overall,\" wrote Andrew Stroehlein, the European media director for Human Rights Watch.</p><p>\"For example, I don't see how it won't be abused by extremist politicians &amp; pundits to send out a rallying call of hate, incitement or targeted abuse, and then edit it to avoid being penalized,\" he added.</p><p>Others welcomed the move, saying it would enable important corrections and clarifications which can often get lost in the noise on such a popular platform.</p><p>Sandip Kamat, who works in product management at HP Inc., suggested Twitter put a time limit on the feature. \"Great. Allow edit for 60 seconds. Show 'edited' tag. Done!,\" he wrote on Twitter.</p><p>Write to Gareth Vipers at gareth.vipers@wsj.com and Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com</p><p>Twitter Is Working on an Edit Button, Early Reviews Are Mixed</p>",
