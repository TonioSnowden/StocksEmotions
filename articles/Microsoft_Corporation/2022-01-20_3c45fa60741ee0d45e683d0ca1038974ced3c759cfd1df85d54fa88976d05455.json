  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>Unilever <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f7f4dfd-ebbf-466a-92ae-5b2e4eb5827c\">has ruled out</a> increasing its £50bn offer for GlaxoSmithKline's consumer health business, in a climbdown that comes after an intensifying investor backlash.</p> <h2>The private equity firm that rules suburbia</h2> <p><strong>Warren Buffett</strong> made it sound easy. </p> <p>As US house prices hit the bottom of the market after a foreclosure crisis had stripped 3.8m Americans of their homes, the billionaire investor mused: “If I had a way of buying a couple hundred thousand single-family homes, I would load up.”</p> <p>There was, of course, no obvious way to buy houses on anything like that scale — but as the <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> chief spoke, a different investment firm was hard at work inventing one. </p> <p><strong>Blackstone</strong>'s investments in suburban housing are the stuff of legend. </p> <p>Beginning in 2012, the private equity firm dispatched representatives to foreclosure auctions across the nation to buy thousands of recently vacated houses at beaten-down prices. The rental company it created, <strong>Invitation Homes</strong>, listed on the stock market in 2017.</p> <p>What was difficult then is even harder today. Houses are no longer cheap, and they're no longer being auctioned off en masse.</p> <p>When Blackstone returned to the suburban property market last year, it tried a new play: rent-to-buy.</p> <p><strong>Home Partners of America</strong>, which Blackstone <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9a07d4c-578d-492b-a9dc-8ea144156e4f\">bought for $6bn</a> in July, presents itself in altruistic terms as a new path for ordinary Americans to become homeowners. </p> <p>Would-be residents work with a real estate broker to choose a house that is currently for sale. Home Partners then buys the property and rents it out on a five-year deal with fixed annual rent bumps and an option to purchase.</p> <p>Yet as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2267d715-6ff9-428e-959a-f0e379e581e9\">this deep dive</a> by DD's Mark Vandevelde explains, Blackstone's biggest bet on suburbia since the foreclosure crisis throws into focus what insiders and some investors say is an unanswered question about the new rent-to-buy model. </p> <p>Is it a financial innovation that will unlock the promise of home ownership for Americans who have been shut out of mortgage finance? </p> <p>Or is it primarily a way of sourcing properties to create a new breed of corporate landlord?</p> <h2>The gaming deal that could reboot the entire industry</h2> <p>It's rare for a mega-deal to be so earth-shattering that shockwaves are felt by the newly formed company's rivals.</p> <p>But the $75bn alliance of <strong>Microsoft </strong>and <em>Call of Duty</em> developer <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> — by far the biggest gaming transaction of all time — packs a lot of firepower.</p> <p>News of the deal sent stock in <strong>Sony </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acb50daf-0fb2-4f51-8b25-c501488fb6fa\">tumbling 12.8 per cent</a> on Wednesday, the Japanese entertainment conglomerate's steepest one-day drop since the financial crisis. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8453060.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Microsoft has gained a head-start in the race to become the “Netflix of gaming”, as the industry moves <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04e874ab-9871-4379-ab3d-e0796f47eb06\">away from traditional consoles</a> and computers towards streaming, virtual reality and the glittering promise of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76d40aac-034e-4e0b-95eb-c5d34146f647\">metaverse</a> where games can be played in an immersive digital world.</p> <p>The deal will consolidate around 30 game studios, sending the $200bn global industry on a mad dash for M&amp;A. As put by <strong>Mirabaud Securities</strong> analyst <strong>Neil Campling</strong>: “This is a new content war, Web 3.0 style.”</p> <p>Sony may have just realised it's losing the battle. Its PlayStation console, host to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93445dac-7872-4b43-8926-9b67755c1684\">rich online community</a> where gamers square off against one another, suddenly looks dated next to Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which will enable members to play games across multiple platforms.</p> <p>Not to mention the fact that some of the most popular PlayStation games (including <em>Call of Duty: Vanguard </em>and <em>Diablo II: Resurrected</em>) will soon be sending money directly into Microsoft's pocket. </p> <p>It's unclear how Microsoft will proceed. “It looks like economic suicide if Microsoft makes the franchise exclusive to its own platform, but they may not care if it makes their platform stronger,” said <strong>David Gibson</strong>, an analyst at<strong> MST Financial</strong>.</p> <p>The potential for Microsoft to cut off its rivals from some of their biggest games is just one of the potential issues US antitrust regulators will be scrutinising as they evaluate the deal. And the timing couldn't be worse for the tech group after the two US competition agencies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8893550-fc6c-4301-879d-209aa9323f5b\">revealed plans</a> on Tuesday to overhaul their merger guidelines. </p> <p>Activision's chief <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e071042-795e-4716-8386-698dc7eef08d\"><strong>Bobby Kotick</strong></a> argues that competition is exactly what fuelled the deal in the first place. “We realised there are a lot of categories of technology and talent that we needed access to that we didn't have and couldn't build fast enough,” he told the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b96246ec-e70e-48b6-9a70-fb0800f79bd8\">in an interview</a>.</p> <p>Sony is likely praying that he's wrong.</p> <h2>Luckin Coffee brews up another US IPO</h2> <p><strong>Luckin Coffee</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8327af5-5203-44fd-acc7-267c7b475fa7\">is pursuing plans</a> to relist its shares in the US nearly two years after it was booted off the Nasdaq exchange for fabricating more than $300m of sales.</p> <p>A self-styled tech-driven coffee shop chain, Luckin rapidly expanded in China in the lead-up to its initial public offering in 2019, growing its network of coffee stores and grabbing market share with pushy marketing strategies and coupons to lure new customers.</p> <p>That all <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b6367d0-7024-420f-9a78-f648382128d5\">fell apart</a> in February 2020, when short sellers <strong>Muddy Waters</strong> published an anonymously-authored report (widely believed to have been written by<strong> Snow Lake Capital</strong>) detailing fraud at the company. </p> <p>After initially dismissing the reports, the company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1d758f2-f66d-47f2-b100-fb43d9e8414e\">eventually admitted</a> in April that it had “fabricated” sales and agreed to pay $180m to settle the accounting fraud charges. </p> <p>Since June 2020, Luckin has continued to trade over-the-counter in the US since it was delisted from the central exchange, giving the company a market valuation of about $2.5bn.</p> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de4fabc5-dcdc-4242-bfbb-23743738901c\">swapping out</a> many of its top-brass executives, opening new stores in China and launching social media-trending drinks like its iced coconut latte — which it says contributed to its explosive 106 per cent year-over-year growth in the third quarter of 2021 — Luckin hopes to convince investors that it holds the keys to the fast-growing Chinese coffee market. </p> <p>That is, if they're not still left with a bitter taste in their mouth from the first time round.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong>'s chief scientific officer<strong> Hal Barron</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b869472-6b70-4e32-81a5-0d28788e8dd4\">will step down</a> in August to join <strong>Altos Labs</strong>, an anti-ageing start-up reportedly backed by billionaires including<strong> Amazon</strong> founder <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>. Barron's departure follows concerns by shareholders over GSK chief executive <strong>Emma Walmsley</strong>'s lack of a scientific background as the company rebuilds its pipeline of drugs. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Natixis</strong> has promoted <strong>Franck Leroy</strong>, currently global head of market risks, to chief risk officer and a member of its senior management committee, effective January 24. He succeeds <strong>Olivier Vigneron</strong>, who was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03a843a8-5ff5-4c24-aaaa-271e5dd291c5\">poached</a> for the same role by<strong> Deutsche Bank</strong> in November.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>ByteDance</strong>, owner of<strong> TikTok </strong>and Chinese sister app<strong> Douyin</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8de842c5-25fc-4c8c-a4e1-fd27f39c187e\">is disbanding</a> its strategic investments team as Chinese regulators step up antitrust scrutiny of the country's large tech groups.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Incognito mode </strong>As Beijing cracks the whip on rival giants such as Alibaba and Meituan, tech superpower Tencent is redirecting its strategy overseas in an effort to fly under its home country's radar.
