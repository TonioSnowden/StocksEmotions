  "title": "Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio Hands Over Control of Firm; Billionaire steps down as co-investment chief of hedge-fund firm, remains on board",
  "text": "<p>The apparent winners in the Bridgewater succession drama are co-investment chiefs and Bridgewater veterans Bob Prince and Greg Jensen, who had a public falling out with Mr. Dalio, and co-chief executives Nir Bar Dea and Mark Bertolini, newer entrants on the scene who were named to their posts in January. But some cast Mr. Dalio as a winner, too, effecting a transition on his terms and timeline.</p><p>Bridgewater had long told clients it had a 10-year transition plan in place intended to institutionalize the firm and move it away from one run by its charismatic founder. During the succession process, Bridgewater tried various chief executives; demoted Mr. Jensen after a power struggle with Mr. Dalio; was sued by its only female chief executive after she resigned; and ran past the 10-year time frame Mr. Dalio had spoken of in transitioning leadership of the firm.</p><p>\"The transition of Bridgewater from Ray is done!\" wrote Messrs. Bar Dea and Bertolini, the firm's co-chief executives, in a note to employees Tuesday to mark an occasion some veteran employees had doubted would ever arrive.</p><p>Bridgewater in February had said the change of control from Mr. Dalio to the board of directors had been signed but that regulatory and other steps needed to be taken before the transaction closed.</p><p>Bridgewater has been working on the process since and, \"On Friday, we finished the work, signed the papers, and closed. The control of the company now sits with our Operating Board. There is nothing left to do on Ray's transition. It's done,\" the note said. Mr. Dalio's voting rights have been transferred to the board, said a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>In a LinkedIn post Tuesday, the 73-year-old Mr. Dalio wrote that the succession process of the last 12 years hadn't been easy, but that \"I feel great about the people and 'machine' now in controlâ€¦I can now visualize it as doing great things for generations without me. That's as good as it gets.\" He also wrote that he hoped to continue to invest, mentor and act as a board member at Bridgewater.</p><p>Bloomberg News earlier reported the news that the transition was complete.</p><p>Mr. Dalio founded Bridgewater in 1975 as a research shop based in his two-bedroom Manhattan apartment and turned to investing after receiving $5 million from the World Bank's pension fund in 1985 to trade bonds. Years of strong growth turned the Connecticut hedge fund into a behemoth and Mr. Dalio into a multibillionaire and popular leadership guruwho championed an unusual management philosophy of \"radical transparency.\"</p><p>Over the years, Bridgewater has taken steps toward succession planning, including the sale of some of Mr. Dalio's equity stake in the firm to outside investors including the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC. Bridgewater more recently created an investment committee and formalized its board of directors.</p><p>Several people familiar with Bridgewater said they believed Bridgewater's strong performance this year enabled Mr. Dalio to step back.</p><p>Bridgewater's flagship Pure Alpha macro funds posted steep losses in early 2020 that Mr. Dalio told clients recalled the worst losses Bridgewater had suffered in its history. But the firm has since made back those losses, and more.</p><p>This year through September, amid rapid macroeconomic shifts that have benefited many macro hedge funds, Pure Alpha gained 34.6% after fees in its higher-volatility share class, said people familiar with the fund. Since its start in 1991, it has averaged 11.3% a year.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bridgewater's All Weather fund was down more than 27% for the period, the people said. That fund uses a risk-parity strategy that aims to spread risk among stocks, bonds and other asset classes to profit, with less volatility, in most types of markets. That strategy has suffered as bonds, which usually rise in price during large stock-market pullbacks, this year have swooned in tandem.</p><p>Write to Juliet Chung at juliet.chung@wsj.com</p><p>Bridgewater Founder Ray Dalio Hands Over Control of Firm</p>",
