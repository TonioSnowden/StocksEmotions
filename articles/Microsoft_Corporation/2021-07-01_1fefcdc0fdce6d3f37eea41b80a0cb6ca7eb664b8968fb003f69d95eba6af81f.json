  "text": "<p>   The Gates Foundation said it would spend $2.1 billion on gender-equality work over five years, deepening a commitment to programs long championed by Melinda French Gates weeks after the philanthropy's guiding couple announced their divorce. </p><p>   The amount is among the largest single commitments the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has made in its more than two decades of work, cementing the advancement of gender equality as a priority alongside polio eradication and the development of vaccines. </p><p>   Amounting to the equivalent of about $420 million a year, the funding is intended to help women get training and financial services, to increase access to contraceptives and to help elevate women into leadership roles in health, law and economics. </p><p>   Ms. French Gates has set an agenda distinct from that of her husband, Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, from whom she filed for divorce in May. For Mr. Gates, eradicating polio and facilitating biomedical breakthroughs such as vaccines are priorities for the foundation. </p><p>   The announcement comes as the philanthropy's leadership weighs changes to its governance and shortly after longtime trustee Warren Buffett stepped down. </p><p>   Ms. French Gates has made women and families the focus of her work in recent years as co-chair of the foundation and at her own company, Pivotal Ventures. </p><p>   Ms. French Gates in 2019 announced a 10-year, $1 billion investment in gender equality through Pivotal Ventures. </p><p>   \"The world has been fighting for gender equality for decades, but progress has been slow,\" she said ahead of a speech she was scheduled to deliver on Wednesday in Paris. </p><p></p>",
