  "title": "Microsoft to Pull the Plug On Explorer --- Web browser, once at center of antitrust fight, has been left far behind by competitors",
  "text": "<p>Internet Explorer has faded gradually from prominence as rival browsers such as Chrome from Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit and Safari from Apple Inc. have won audiences. Internet Explorer had less than 2% of the global browser market for desktop computers in April, according to web analytics firm Statcounter. Chrome had more than 65% of that market, ahead of Safari's roughly 10%. Microsoft Edge had 8%, according to the data.</p><p>Internet Explorer joins other big names from the early days of the internet era to transition from digital reality to corporate history after being overtaken by others. AOL Instant Messenger was retired in 2017 after users flocked to platforms such as Facebook Inc.'s WhatsApp. Two years later, Tumblr, the microblogging site turned social-media network, was sold for a pittance after being overtaken by Facebook and others. BlackBerry Ltd., the company that popularized mobile email, stopped selling its own devices after Apple's success with the iPhone. It still provides security software for phones and other devices.</p><p>More than two decades ago, Internet Explorer was riding high -- perhaps too high to some. It featured prominently in the browser battle of roughly 20 years ago and in the U.S. government's antitrust battle against Microsoft. A federal judge ruled that Microsoft maintained its monopoly in operating-systems software by anticompetitive means and attempted to monopolize the browser market by unlawfully tying Internet Explorer to its Windows operating-system software. The practice caused the use of Netscape Navigator, once a dominant browser, \"to drop substantially\" from 1995 to 1998, the judge wrote. Microsoft in 2001 reached a settlement with the Justice Department over its allegations, without admitting wrongdoing.</p><p>Microsoft's decision to sunset the browser is also a reflection of how people have changed their habits around accessing the internet, with the rise of tablets and smartphones supplanting, for many, the use of personal computers. Apple's introduction of the App Store on the iPhone, for instance, provided a different way for people to access Internet applications. Some of the practices around those tools are now under antitrust scrutiny.</p>",
