  "text": "<p><strong>One podcast to start: </strong>don't miss DD's Kaye Wiggins on the FT News Briefing podcast today, where she explains why private equity firms are targeting UK companies, and how the public is pushing back. Listen <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/ft-news-briefing\">here</a>, or wherever you get your podcasts.</p> <h2>The M&amp;A powerhouses behind an epic corporate duel</h2> <p>One reason messy corporate quarrels usually end in settlements: no one wants to see their dirty laundry in open court. </p> <p>Today two of the shiniest brands in the dealmaking world — an elite law firm and a top CEO adviser — can only rue why their client decided to take a case to the limit.</p> <p>Last week the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7412f910-3043-466c-a3a8-74132713cf7d\">reported</a> on the corporate communications group <strong>Teneo</strong>'s attempt to help its client, <strong>Cigna</strong>, escape the $50bn-plus merger it signed up for with rival US health insurer <strong>Anthem</strong> back in 2015.&#xa0;</p> <p>Things got ugly, and what started as a behind-the-scenes brawl became a public spectacle in a Delaware court. (The judge even <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7412f910-3043-466c-a3a8-74132713cf7d\">referred</a> to Teneo as being skilled in “the darker arts of influencing the media and public discourse”.)</p> <p>DD's Sujeet Indap took a deep-dive into the <a href=\"https://courts.delaware.gov/Opinions/Download.aspx?id=310020\">court documents</a> chronicling the healthcare giants' 2019 legal drama. They paint a picture of one of the nastiest disputes in recent dealmaking history, and offer a glimpse into the hidden forces (ie, shrewd public relations advisers) behind the veil of mega mergers and acquisitions.</p> <p>Here's how it all began: <strong>David Cordani</strong>, Cigna's chief executive, was under the impression that he would join Anthem upon the deal's closing, eventually replacing Anthem's then-CEO <strong>Joe Swedish</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>When it turned out that Cordani appeared to be the victim of a bait-and-switch by Anthem, in which he would be sidelined at the new company, Cigna called in back-up.</p> <p>Cigna, according to evidence that the court relied on, resorted to a “covert communications campaign” that involved not just Teneo but <strong>Wachtell Lipton</strong>, the prestigious New York law firm.</p> <p>The campaign involved <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/anthem-cigna-privately-bicker-as-they-seek-merger-approval-1463909404\">secretive leaks</a> to The Wall Street Journal, a search for unflattering photos and even silly code names to keep people in the dark — Wachtell Lipton was referred to internally by Cigna as “the tea company”.</p> <p>Alas, their covert manoeuvring has come to light. And worse yet, the court has denied Cigna a $1.85bn termination fee from Anthem, which it thought it was entitled to over the busted deal.</p> <p>Next time, the high-priced advice ought to be on helping clients to avoid the witness stand and discovery requests at all costs.</p> <p>Go deep into the details with Sujeet's full story <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/357237f1-408e-4420-85e5-b6c2449331b9?\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Caffeine headache: is your coffee getting more expensive?</h2> <p>There's been a lot of chatter in the “virtual” FT breakroom over how we take our coffee. (With a splash of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0b31167-4697-4ac2-bb81-ae6c9ad934c9\">oat milk</a>? Black, like the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd513f92-142a-11e5-abda-00144feabdc0\">great Japanese artist</a> <strong>Takashi Murakami</strong>? <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cea2c993-b166-48f2-89a6-2caa914af785\">By drone</a>?) Our colleagues in Singapore seem to have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d35bb5e-d33c-4338-8a67-a22785ffb692\">some of the best options</a>.</p> <p>But our daily fixes, no matter how they're prepared, could soon become a costlier vice, as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4146bb5-896b-4f1f-b5f8-930cb2bfb729\">surge in coffee prices</a> threatens to trickle into costs paid by consumers.</p> <p>The futures benchmark in New York for arabica, the high-end coffee bean, hit a four-and-a-half year high of almost $1.70 a pound, up almost 70 per cent from the previous year.</p> <p>Natural disaster, social unrest and logistical bottlenecks are among the culprits.</p> <p>Top bean producer Brazil has suffered the worst drought in almost a century, leading to the first supply shortfall in the coffee market in four years, as anti-government protests in Colombia caused a delay in exports earlier this year, further pushing up prices.</p> <p>Retailers are feeling the pressure. The German coffee chain <strong>Tchibo</strong> said it was raising prices by 50 cents to €1 a pound, while <strong>JM Smucker</strong>, the US parent of <strong>Folgers </strong>and <strong>Dunkin'</strong> coffee, also forecasted price increases. <strong>Nespresso</strong>, <strong>Nestlé</strong>'s premium coffee unit, said that in the US it was taking a wait-and-see approach.</p> <p>Hedge funds have woken up to the scent of pricier coffee, piling into the arabica futures market last month to accumulate a large net long position — aka a bet that prices will rise — equivalent to Colombia's annual production.</p> <p>“Some of the drama we've seen in terms of the change of the price has to be attributed to these huge capital inflows we've seen coming in from non-physical players,” Max Copestake, an executive director at Marex, told the FT.</p> <p>Unwilling to pay a premium on your morning brew? The FT's Anjli Raval has a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f583113c-eb7c-4572-a2ce-4e62a414fb66\">delicious alternative</a>.</p> <h2>The Greensill show returns with a surprise FT guest</h2> <p>In the sprawling set of government inquiries into the collapse of <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>, we've heard hours and hours of testimony.&#xa0;</p> <p>British lawmakers have grilled everyone from former prime minister<strong> David Cameron</strong> to<strong> Lex Greensill</strong> himself, in a bid to shed more light on the financial and political scandal.</p> <p>One key character whose voice has been missing though is <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong>, the metals magnate whose business — and financing arrangements with Greensill — are now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b56416b2-340d-4866-9c79-6341a9c9f904\">under investigation</a> by the UK's <strong>Serious Fraud Office</strong>. Gupta, who has denied wrongdoing and pledged to co-operate with the investigation, withdrew from a parliamentary committee hearing on Tuesday.</p> <p>But while DD was disappointed not to hear from the “Man of Steel” himself, the star speaker on Tuesday was someone who knows almost as much about Gupta's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aca5f4d3-6ae1-46ce-8729-ce2f2d4ab9f7\">complicated tangle</a> of corporate entities: the FT's very own Cynthia O'Murchu.</p> <p>A stalwart of the FT's investigation desk, Cynthia broke down the dark arts of invoice financing at the heart of the Greensill and Gupta fiasco in characteristically forensic fashion.
