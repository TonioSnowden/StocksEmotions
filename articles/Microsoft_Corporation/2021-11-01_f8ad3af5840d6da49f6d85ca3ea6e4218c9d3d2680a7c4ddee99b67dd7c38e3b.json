Their research, conducted before and during the pandemic, found that tech-mediated collaboration provides benefits but comes with four big risks: isolation, exclusion, surveillance and self-censorship.</p><p>The researchers described their findings recently in the MIT Sloan Management Review, and Dr. Soga elaborated in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Q:</p><p>Why is surveillance a problem?</p><p>A:</p><p>One individual said, \"My manager was showing as offline, but she typed into the group only a few minutes ago, and I wonder who she was deceiving that she was offline? If she doesn't want to be disturbed, she could have simply asked people not to contact her today or something.\" The same sort of thing happens among peers, and I found that fascinating. These technologies by default leave data trails of what, when, where, and how individuals are interacting, and some of that data is readily available even if the user wishes it not to be. Your only way of avoiding this is to not do anything at all, thus leading to self-censorship.</p><p>Q:</p><p>What effect does that have on trust in the workplace?</p><p>A:</p><p>A surveillance culture makes people quietly question the integrity of their managers.

The agency isn't waiting for lawmakers to pass legislation on the matter, CISA Director Jen Easterly said last week at a conference hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. (CyberScoop)</p><p>So-called systemically important critical infrastructure, or SICI, includes functions and systems that would create an immediate threat to U.S. national or economic security if hacked. CISA's version is called \"primary systemically important entities.\" Either way, organizations so categorized would receive more detailed intelligence briefings and additional cyber support than other infrastructure operators.</p><p>Rep. John Katko (R., N.Y.), the top-ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, introduced a bill in early October to make SICI designations.</p><p>Watch out for password sprays: Senior executives are being more intensely targeted than usual in password-spraying campaigns in which hackers rapidly try common passwords to break into accounts, Microsoft warned. This tactic of throwing spaghetti against the firewall is also being used against cloud administrator accounts. Why an uptick now? Security tools are getting better at identifying abnormal activity and hackers who correctly guess user credentials can avoid tripping alarms, Microsoft said. (Bleeping Computer)</p><p>Detecting threats in 5G infrastructure: The National Security Agency and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency put out the first of a four-part advisory on protecting networks and cloud systems running on 5G infrastructure. Part 1 focuses on preventing and detecting hackers moving laterally.</p><p>A 5G network allows more data to be processed, and faster, than today's telecom systems. Advanced Internet-of-Things devices from smart appliances to autonomous cars to remote surgical instruments will generate tons of network traffic. From a security standpoint, that means picking out suspicious activity gets tougher.</p><p>CISA and NSA say analysis tools that use machine learning and artificial intelligence can help. But executives will have to make careful policy decisions that might pit privacy against security. \"Balancing data confidentiality requirements with the ability to inspect network traffic for threats is a challenging problem when developing analytics,\" the agencies say.</p><p>$200 Million</p><p>Amount industrial cybersecurity company Dragos Inc. raised in a Series D investment round, at a valuation of $1.7 billion.

MCH said it is working with the Swiss National Cyber Security Centre, local police and cybersecurity experts to investigate the incident. Celebrities, art collectors and the super wealthy often attend Art Basel shows. (New York Post)</p><p>Regulation</p><p>Shoring up its stance: The European Union plans to reconcile this month two proposals for regulating large U.S. tech companies, the Digital Markets Act and the Digital Services Act. One sticking point is how to revamp rules that currently say a firm is regulated by the watchdog in the country where its headquarters office is. That means Ireland is handling several substantial cases involving several substantial companies, including Facebook and Google. Other countries have complained that under this arrangement enforcement takes too long. Talks to solidify the EU's stance are expected to happen Nov. 8. (Reuters)</p>",
