  "text": "<p>ESG implementation by investment managers requires, quite simply, high-quality, verifiable data reported at regular intervals. The expansion of ESG investing beyond large-cap U.S. stocks to small-cap and international companies increases data needs even further.</p><p>But where does this data come from? There are many ESG data vendors, and they rely upon both public and company information.&#xa0;The sustainability reports published by many companies can be a good source, as they are in the public domain. For corporate governance, regulatory filings provide valuable information on board composition and other issues.&#xa0;</p><p>However, for environmental and social issues, data is self-reported and spotty. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p><p>Take gender-pay equity for instance; in the aftermath of the #MeToo movement, it has become a hot-button topic for investors.&#xa0;The movement has pushed gender-pay equity on to the agenda at company annual general meetings (AGMs), and on to proxy voting cards, resulting in ESG investors asking for disclosure from companies about the pay differences by gender with good reason: Analysis by the Pew Research Center shows that in 2020 women earned 84% of what men earned.</p><p>How have companies and ESG fund managers responded?&#xa0;</p><p>I examined all resolutions on gender-pay gap disclosure for the 2020 proxy voting season for the Vanguard Social Index Fund, the largest ESG index fund with assets under management of about $8 billion and almost 500 stocks.</p><p>Below is a table of the proposals, the recommendations of company management (“for or “against”) on how shareholders ought to vote, and the votes cast by the fund.</p><p> Company                           AGM date    Proposal                                        Sponsor      Type    Management recommendation  Vote cast  Adobe Inc.

Then why are they attempting to block disclosure to investors? Are they walking the walk but not talking the talk?</p><p>One possible reason is that there are costs associated with disclosure related to tracking, benchmarking and reporting the gender-pay gap. But these are by and large multinationals already operating in the U.K., where gender-pay gap reporting is mandated.&#xa0;The European Union is also moving in this direction. Another possible reason is the risks associated with disclosure:&#xa0;potential lawsuits, bad publicity and management distraction.</p><p>Regardless, the failure of passive ESG fund managers to support disclosure as evidenced by their proxy voting exacerbates the issue. If companies won't disclose data on workforce pay equity and fund managers do not push for disclosure, how will investors distinguish among companies — such as Citigroup C, Mastercard MA and Starbucks SBUX — that are indeed taking steps to close the gender-pay gap, and those that are merely paying lip service?</p><p>All these companies earned an A rank in the Arjuna Capital Racial and Gender Pay Scorecard for benchmarking, “providing an honest accounting of the problem and working to remedy it over time.”</p><p>The same trend appears for a resolution asking for a report on sexual-harassment policy at Delta Air Lines DAL in 2019 and 2020, and XPO Logistics XPO in 2020. Management also recommended a vote against a resolution asking for a report on efforts to reduce pesticide use in the supply chain at Kraft Heinz KHC in 2019 and 2020.&#xa0;</p><p>Socially responsible investing cannot be implemented without good data, which has to be primarily provided by companies. Company strategies to deal with urgent issues such as climate change, racial equity and compensation disparities cannot be addressed until and unless we have disclosure.</p><p>What is the solution? Regulated disclosure is one path forward, as in the U.K. Another is to pressure ESG fund managers to vote for disclosure on social issues. Investors can vote with their retirement and savings dollars by avoiding ESG fund managers that do not support the push for transparency.&#xa0;</p><p>Without disclosure, funds will be engaging in “impact washing,” and there can be no change.&#xa0;</p><p>Gita R.
