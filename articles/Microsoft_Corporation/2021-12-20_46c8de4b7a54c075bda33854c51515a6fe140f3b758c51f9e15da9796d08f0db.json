  "title": "VC Daily: Bessemer Expands Beyond Venture Investing; Bessemer Venture Partners is starting a growth-buyout platform that will allow it to take minority stakes in companies that don't fit the traditional venture investing mold due to their growth trajectory, stage or structure",
  "text": "<p>Rob Arditi will lead the initiative, called BVP Forge. Mr. Arditi previously was co-head of Norwest Venture Partners' growth equity unit.</p><p>Bessemer's announcement comes after other venture firms have made moves that allow them greater investing freedom beyond traditional venture capital.</p><p>\"We've seen firms approach investing from a broader lens, widening their purview and investing strategies, looking for ways to differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive market,\" said Jeff Grabow, U.S. venture capital leader at Ernst &amp; Young LLP. \"This is in response to the incredible amount of capital that has poured into the venture asset class.\"</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Refining data insights. The new chief information officer of Farmers Business Network Inc.—a company that runs an Amazon.com-like platform for farmers to buy supplies from seed to pesticides—plans to use data to sharpen the insights it offers farmers, as well as bring more of them to the site and keep them coming back, WSJ's Suman Bhattacharyya reports. Kumud Kokal, former vice president of e-commerce firm Stitch Fix Inc., joined the seven-year-old San Carlos, Calif.-based network and platform in October in the newly created role.</p><p>\"We want to make sure that the data that you get back, the insights that you're generating are very much applicable to you,\" Mr. Kokal said, \"so that means localization, giving you information that is very relevant in your ZIP Code, on your farm.\"</p><p>Valued at $3.9 billion, FBN has thus far raised $878 million, including a $300 million Series G round in November led by FMR LLC, parent of Fidelity Investments.</p><p>$650 Million</p><p>The amount that life sciences venture investor Omega Funds raised for its seventh venture fund.</p><p>SenseTime Files Revised Documents for IPO</p><p>Chinese artificial-intelligence giant SenseTime Group Inc. filed revised documents for a Hong Kong initial public offering and said it still plans to list before the end of the year, after the U.S. government moved to restrict American investors from buying its stock, the Journal reports. Early Monday in Hong Kong, the company said it would relaunch its IPO later the same day. It still aims to raise the equivalent of up to $767 million, with a maximum valuation of $17 billion—unchanged from its original offering plan. The company's shares will start trading on Dec. 30. On Dec. 10, the day that the company was originally poised to price its IPO, the U.S. Treasury Department placed SenseTime on a list of companies that it said support China's military. The blacklist prevents American investors from buying the company's stock.</p><p>Inflation Adds to Cost of Clean-Energy Transition</p><p>Energy companies have to spend more to build solar and wind farms for the first time in years because of cost inflation and supply-chain problems, adding a financial speed bump to the switch from fossil fuels, the Journal reports. Clean-energy projects are exposed to inflation in old-school commodity markets by their dependence on materials such as silicon and copper. The wholesale price of solar panels has risen 19% in Europe this year, according to Martin Schachinger, managing director of pvXchange Trading GmbH, taking them to levels from late 2018. Prices remain about a third below where they stood five years ago.</p><p>Industry News</p><p>Funds</p><p>Life sciences venture firm Omega Funds secured $650 million for its seventh fund, beating its $500 million fundraising target. Boston-based Omega's latest vehicle tops the $438 million raised for its last fund in 2019. Omega said it plans to use the fund to create and invest in U.S. and European companies, targeting fields such as cancer, immunology, rare diseases and precision medicine. Omega's portfolio includes biotechnology companies such as vaccine developer Icosavax Inc. and cancer drug developer Nuvation Bio Inc. Both went public this year.
