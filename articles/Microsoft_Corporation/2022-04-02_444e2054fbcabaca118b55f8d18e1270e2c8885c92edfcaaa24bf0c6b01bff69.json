  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Microsoft's Mr. Nice Guy --- While other tech giants are under regulatory scrutiny, Brad Smith has led Microsoft to a more amicable role -- which sometimes burns rivals. The Activision deal will test the strategy.",
  "text": "<p>Rivals say he is also skilled at directing negative attention toward competitors -- to Microsoft's benefit.</p><p>The 63-year-old's influence is being tested as the company tries to smooth the way for its largest-ever acquisition, a $75 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard Inc. While regulators have yet to approve it, lawmakers and industry representatives say it's hard to imagine any of the other four biggest U.S. tech companies -- Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., or Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. -- being in a position to even attempt to win approval for a deal of that size in today's environment.</p><p>\"If this was any of the other four regular suspects, the blowback would be much greater,\" said Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.).</p><p>Mr. Smith's strategy has been to cooperate with regulators who often have Microsoft's rivals in the crosshairs. He has criticized Apple's operation of its App Store -- as Microsoft tries to bring its \"Netflix for gaming\" service to the iPhone. He has supported measures to cut into Facebook and Google's dominance of digital advertising -- which could benefit Microsoft's search and digital-ad businesses. His support of tech-sector regulations has cut against efforts by Amazon, Microsoft's fierce rival in cloud computing, to fight constraints on its business practices.</p><p>His team pulled Microsoft out of trade associations created to help the tech industry speak with one voice, and let a truce lapse with Google under which the companies had agreed to stop lodging regulatory complaints against each other.</p><p>Kent Walker, Google's chief legal officer, said in a blog post early last year that Mr. Smith's stance on some issues smacked of \"naked corporate opportunism.\"</p><p>While government scrutiny and competition between tech companies have been increasing, the stances Microsoft takes aren't calculated to undercut competitors, Mr. Smith said in an interview.</p><p>Instead, he said the company is looking to align itself with the coming regulations and principles the company agrees with -- even if it creates more regulatory hurdles.</p><p>He drew a parallel to banks, which faced new rules in the 1930s following financial panics. \"It turned them from unregulated companies to regulated businesses,\" he said. \"Resistance proved futile.\"</p><p>Few other tech executives have Mr. Smith's combination of seniority within their companies and experience grappling with political and regulatory power centers. He joined Microsoft in 1993 and served as a legal adviser through its bitter antitrust disputes with regulators around the world in the 1990s.</p><p>Microsoft's general counsel in the '90s had a more confrontational approach with regulators, said former Microsoft employees. In 2001, Mr. Smith made a pitch to Microsoft's board of directors to become the next general counsel with a single PowerPoint slide that said: \"It's time to make peace.\" He started the job the next year.</p><p>Following a major settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in 2001, which placed restrictions on Microsoft's business practices, Mr. Smith pursued the resolution of dozens of cases with governments and companies around the world. The new amity became a weapon in Microsoft's competitive arsenal.</p><p>In 2007, Microsoft lost to Google in acquiring ad-tech company DoubleClick, which the rival bought for $3.1 billion. Steve Ballmer, then Microsoft's chief executive, told Mr. Smith to ensure that Google faced the same regulatory scrutiny it had weathered, said former employees who worked with Mr. Smith.</p><p>Mr. Smith lobbied officials to block the deal over Google's dominance in digital ads. The effort failed but ignited a nasty fight with Google, which was beginning to compete with Microsoft in areas such as office productivity software, a core strategic focus for Microsoft.</p><p>Mr. Smith created a new group, called the Office of Strategic Relations, to push antitrust cases against Google in the U.S. and Europe. It backed anti-Google groups and gave financial assistance and expertise to companies challenging Google, such as small U.K.-based price-comparison website Foundem, which filed an antitrust complaint in 2009. European officials fined Google nearly $3 billion in connection to the complaint in 2017.</p><p>Mr. Ballmer wanted even more aggressive action and tapped political strategist Mark Penn, who engineered an attack-ad series against Google from 2012 to 2014. One ad pointed out that Google search results feature paid advertisements, saying: \"Don't get Scroogled, you may be missing out on the best prices and highest quality products. For an honest search, try Bing.\"</p><p>Mr. Smith's role changed again after 2014, when Satya Nadella became CEO and quickly moved to shift Microsoft's culture from combative corporate politics to more collaboration within and outside the company. One of his first public actions was to make Microsoft's Office productivity software available on Apple's iPad -- a move away from tying its applications closely to its Windows operating system.</p><p>The new CEO promoted Mr. Smith to president in 2015, giving him more clout to meet with officials. The following year, Microsoft and Google agreed to a five-year truce to end complaints against each other to regulators. Mr. Smith shut down the Office of Strategic Relations competition group.</p><p>Since taking the president's job, Mr. Smith has become a more prominent public face of Microsoft. He relished the role -- members of his team sometimes referred to him as \"Governor Smith\" -- and often talked about having cell numbers of important members of Congress, said people who worked with him. He outlined his global tech vision, including a Digital Geneva Convention to govern cyberwarfare, in his 2019 book \"Tools and Weapons.\"</p><p>As regulatory scrutiny of big tech companies has intensified, Mr. Smith has taken the gloves off with Microsoft's competitors, throwing its name behind policy proposals that rivals strongly oppose -- often in cases where Microsoft's bottom line would be affected least.</p><p>\"Microsoft has pursued a strategy of trying to position itself apart from Big Tech and as the most responsible player,\" said Adam Kovacevich, a former Google lobbyist who now leads the Chamber of Progress, a nonprofit advocacy group funded by Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and others.</p><p>Frank Shaw, corporate vice president of corporate communications at Microsoft, said, \"No one is perfect, but we strive to be principled, and occasionally this creates an opportunity to separate ourselves from the competition.\"</p><p>Lawmakers and congressional aides say Microsoft has been more willing than other tech giants to make both executives and expert staff available as they tackle thorny tech policy issues, such as responding to cyberattacks or sending user data across international borders.</p><p>\"We've tried to identify the concerns that people might have and then go address them proactively,\" Mr. Smith said. \"I think that's going to serve us better in getting [the Activision] acquisition approved.\"</p><p>After the company announced the Activision bid early this year, Mr. Smith's team reached out to aides of Rep. Ken Buck, the top Republican on the House Antitrust Subcommittee, whom the tech executive has known for years.</p><p>Mr. Smith wanted to assuage any concerns the Colorado congressman might have about the impact of the deal on industry competition, an issue Mr. Buck has championed.</p><p>Mr. Buck, one of the most vocal critics of big technology companies in a Congress full of them, seemed persuaded. Within hours of the deal's announcement, he posted about it on his Twitter account, which he routinely uses to assail Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. \"The assurances I've received from Microsoft are encouraging,\" he tweeted.</p><p>Mr. Smith has cultivated a relationship with Mr. Buck for years -- grabbing breakfast with him soon after the Coloradan was first elected to the House in 2014. Since then, Mr. Smith has regularly shared his private feedback and public support on tech legislation.</p><p>\"I think that Brad learned from his experience as an attorney representing Microsoft that the best way to deal with those folks on the Hill is to go visit them in person,\" said Mr. Buck. \"I just don't get that kind of feedback\" from senior executives at other companies.</p><p>In mid-2020, Mr. Buck and other members of the House antitrust panel were preparing for a contentious hearing with the CEOs of Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google on the companies' market power. Subcommittee staff organized a meeting with lawmakers, envisioned as a sort of pep talk before they faced the tech titans.</p><p>Mr. Smith was the speaker, and he delved into Microsoft's history under Washington scrutiny.One takeaway for lawmakers, two attendees said, was that asking CEOs tough questions is a good thing.</p><p>Mr. Shaw, the Microsoft spokesman, said Mr. Smith's message was that the experience had taught the company it needed to address \"heightened expectations\" and \"to get out and listen to what other people had to say and do more to help solve technology problems.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
