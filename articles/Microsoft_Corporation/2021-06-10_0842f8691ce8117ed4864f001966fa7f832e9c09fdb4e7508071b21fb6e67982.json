  "title": "Shell  To Speed  Cuts in  Emissions  ----  By Sarah McFarlane",
  "text": "<p>   LONDON -- Royal Dutch Shell PLC said it would accelerate its efforts to cut its carbon emissions in the wake of a Dutch court ruling last month ordering the oil giant to take more drastic action. </p><p>   In a post on LinkedIn on Wednesday, Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said Shell disagreed with the ruling and still expected to appeal the court's order to curb emissions by 45% by 2030, but nonetheless would rise to the challenge of doing more. </p><p>   \"Now we will seek ways to reduce emissions even further in a way that remains purposeful and profitable. That is likely to mean taking some bold but measured steps over the coming years,\" Mr. van Beurden said. </p><p>   Shell in February set out plans to gradually reduce its oil output by 1% to 2% a year and expand in areas including electricity and biofuels. Other big oil companies have pledged to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and invest more in low-carbon energy amid growing pressure from activists, investors and governments. </p><p>   Mr. van Beurden didn't elaborate on what actions the company might take or to what extent it would speed up its pivot to lower-carbon energy. Shell declined to comment further on his comments. </p><p>   The district court in The Hague, ruling in a case brought by environmental organizations, said its decision was based on broadly accepted United Nations guidance aimed at limiting global warming and human-rights-related law that is similar across Europe. The ruling could set a precedent, at least in Europe, that individual companies bear a legal responsibility to protect people from climate change. </p><p>   \"I still feel disappointed that Shell is being singled out by a ruling that I believe does not help reduce global CO2 emissions,\" said Mr. van Beurden, adding that the company expects to produce oil and gas for a long time to come. </p><p>   If Shell pursues an appeal, the case could take around one to two years to be heard, after which it could be further appealed in the Dutch supreme court. The district court said last month that its order would stand provisionally, despite acknowledging potentially far-reaching consequences for Shell that might be difficult to undo. </p><p>   Friends of the Earth Netherlands, the environmental nonprofit that brought the case, said it welcomed Mr. van Beurden's comments but called on the company to take more aggressive action. </p><p>   Shell has previously said it estimates its carbon emissions peaked in 2018 and that it plans to reduce the carbon intensity -- the volume of carbon per unit of energy -- of the products it sells by 20% by 2030 and 100% by 2050. </p><p></p>",
