In some editions Thursday, a Page One What's News summary incorrectly said the deal was valued at $10 billion. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  The District of Columbia was incorrectly labeled as a state in a graphic with an Aug. 31 U.S. News article about Covid-19 hospitalizations. The same error appeared in an Aug. 26 graphic with a U.S. News article about congressionally appropriated funds for rental assistance. </p><p>\n  (See: \"U.S. News: Covid-19 Hospitalizations Approach a Peak\" -- WSJ Aug. 31, 2021 and \"U.S. News: U.S. Struggles to Deliver Aid to Renters --- Just a fraction of promised assistance reached tenants and landlords through July\" -- WSJ Aug. 26, 2021) </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  The surname of Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, a former executive at Theranos Inc., was misspelled in one instance as Bawlani in some editions Thursday in a Business &amp; Finance article about the criminal trial of company founder Elizabeth Holmes. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  The European Union will require new legal guarantees about data privacy on existing business contracts that involve international data transfers starting Dec. 27, 2022.

The article was written for a grid with a horizontal axis showing team performance ranging from weakling to powerhouse, and a vertical axis showing team behavior ranging from embarrassing to admirable. When the axes were reversed, descriptions of which quadrant a team resides in became incorrect.
