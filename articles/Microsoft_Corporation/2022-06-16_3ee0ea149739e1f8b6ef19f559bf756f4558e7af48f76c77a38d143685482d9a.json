  "text": "<p>Transport secretary Grant Shapps has warned thousands of railway workers could lose their jobs if more passengers shift to remote working as a result of strikes that are set to cripple the network next week. </p> <p>Shapps said the industrial action called by the RMT union was an “incredible act of self-harm” just as people were coming back to the railways following the pandemic. </p> <p>The rail industry was competing with remote working and video conferencing companies, such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom, as much as with private cars, and could not afford to lose more revenue from commuters, Shapps added.</p> <p>“Wave them goodbye and we will endanger the jobs of thousands of railway workers,” he said in a speech on Thursday.</p> <p>About 40,000 RMT members working for infrastructure manager Network Rail and 13 train operating companies plan to strike on June 21, 23 and 25 over low pay rises and potential job cuts.</p> <p>The strikes will cause significant disruption throughout next week, even on non-strike days. In response, the rail industry has outlined plans to close large parts of the network, and run only about 20 per cent of the usual timetable even on lines that are open. </p> <p>With London's streets expected to be busy, Taxi company Addison Lee told customers it would add a £5 surcharge onto each journey with 75 miles of London, which it said was “to ensure we have sufficient cars on the day”. The money will go directly to drivers, Addison Lee said. </p> <p>Shapps said the government would push ahead with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1d2b4cb-2b07-43f8-9971-684b0c76999c\">plans to bring in agency workers</a> to keep services running if the strikes drag on through the summer and beyond, adding that the disruption next week was likely to cause “misery” for passengers. </p> <p>He again ruled out direct talks between the government and the RMT, as the union on Thursday said the government “has no intention of negotiating a settlement” and was instead “determined to pour petrol on this fire”. </p> <p>“RMT members will not meekly join the dole queue in order to protect the private profits of the people who have been ripping this country off for 30 years,” Eddie Dempsey, senior assistant general secretary of the RMT, told ITV on Thursday. </p> <p>Staff at Network Rail are subject to the public sector pay cap of 2 per cent, which can be extended to about 3 per cent if bosses can negotiate productivity gains to offset the extra pay. The rate of inflation in the UK hit a 40-year high of 9 per cent in April. </p> <p>Ministers effectively control the industry's finances following changes brought in during the pandemic, but Shapps said it was for Network Rail and train operators to negotiate. </p> <p>Network Rail has said the strikes will cost the industry between £100mn and £150mn in lost revenue and delayed engineering works, money that will be lost unless the Treasury provides more emergency funding. </p> <p>Britain's railways cost £20bn per year to run, and in the year to April 2021 raised only £4bn from fares and other revenues, Shapps said. </p> <p>Fare revenues will have increased this year as passenger numbers have returned to 80 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, but Shapps said the industry still needed to cut costs. </p> <p>He said unions needed to “move with the times” and modernise working practices that were rooted in the “steam age”, and accused RMT leaders of refusing to engage on changes such as using technology to monitor tracks or closing quiet ticket offices.</p> <p>Customers who had booked to travel, including season ticket holders, would be offered refunds because of the disruption, the Department for Transport said. </p><p>Source: Philip Georgiadis in London 2022 'Transport secretary warns UK rail strikes risk thousands of job losses ' FT.com 16 June.
