The cost will be 219 pesos per additional home in Argentina. Those on Netflix's basic plan can add one extra home, while those on standard plans can add two extra homes and those on premium plans can add three, per the post.</p><p>Netflix says that travel is \"included\" in this new system, as viewers can use tablets, laptops, or mobile devices to watch the streaming service while away from home.
