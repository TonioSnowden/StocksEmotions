  "text": "<p>In Calvin Kasulke's slyly satirical debut <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1529358345/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1529358345&amp;linkId=0c5d1038088ed84fe9bd4783d48e86f3\"><strong>Several People Are Typing</strong></a> (Hodder Studio, £12.99), New York PR agency employee Gerald somehow has his consciousness uploaded into Slack, the app used for intra-company communication. </p> <p>Alarming though this may be for him, his colleagues soon notice that he has become more diligent and industrious, even as they grapple with a publicity disaster involving one of their clients, a dog food manufacturer whose product poisons Pomeranians. Then, much to Gerald's dismay, Slack's AI helper bot decides to commandeer his vacant body and head out to explore the delights of the physical world.</p> <p>Told entirely through online messages between the various characters, the novel wittily addresses the dehumanising absurdities of modern office life: co-workers constantly chatting and bantering via keyboard, sharing gifs and memes, but failing to engage with one another in any meaningful way. The funniest sections centre on Gerald's exasperated interactions with the helper bot, whose personality combines the chirpiness of Microsoft Word's “Clippy” with obsessive quotation from Yeats's doom-laden “The Second Coming”.</p> <p>Corporate America is also skewered in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1683692608/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1683692608&amp;linkId=ff6f9306983cb790073043590eafdfec\"><strong>Dare to Know</strong></a> (Quirk, £17.99) by James Kennedy. The novel's unnamed narrator is a sales rep for a company that has successfully monetised a newly discovered subatomic particle, the “thanaton”, from which it has developed an algorithm capable of calculating the exact moment of anyone's death, a piece of foreknowledge some will pay handsomely for. After crashing his car one snowy night, the narrator impulsively takes a peek at his own death date, only to find that he perished 23 minutes earlier.</p> <p>This impels him to rake over the coals of the past and reconnect with former flame Julia, who may be able to confirm whether or not he really is supposed to have died. Kennedy dials up the feverish surreality of his protagonist's predicament, thickening the stew with plot elements such as a looming apocalypse and the lost Native American city of Cahokia, where human sacrifice was practised. It all holds together, just, and makes for an entertainingly mind-bending read.</p> <p>Nick Mamatas's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1781089264/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1781089264&amp;linkId=968c4ddaea8da07718cc411e57da3b41\"><strong>The Second Shooter</strong></a> (Solaris, £8.99) likewise revels in weirdness, delving into America's conspiracy theory culture. Mike Karras, a down-at-heel journalist working for a small-press publisher, is carrying out research for a book about mysterious, half-glimpsed additional gunmen whom eyewitnesses claim to have seen at assassinations and mass shootings. </p> <p>Karras's investigations into the phenomenon lead him deep into the realms of rightwing radio talk-show hosts and QAnon-style paranoia. In its final third, the story takes a turn for the metaphysical, following its own dark logic to a downbeat conclusion. Along the way Mamatas offers plenty of scathing commentary on gun violence and misuse of social media, in a novel that is both smart and topical.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1781089140/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1781089140&amp;linkId=11639ced512bb80a387b94adefc70c94\"><strong>A Hole in the World</strong></a> (Solaris, £8.99) by Weston Ochse is an altogether brasher, breezier affair. When two towns, one in South Dakota, the other in the English Midlands, mysteriously vanish, the Black Dragoons are called in. They're a secret elite British military task force set up to deal with supernatural menaces, and on this occasion they're assisted by Lieutenant Laurie May, call sign “Preacher's Daughter”. She has been seconded from Special Unit 77, the Dragoons' US equivalent, who have featured in two of Ochse's previous novels, <em>Dead Sky</em> and <em>Burning Sky</em>.</p> <p>The mission pits them against the wilder and more sinister manifestations of British fairy folklore, and Ochse has great fun depicting troops armed with the very latest weaponry tackling giants, dryads and suchlike. Having served in the military himself, he is one of the few authors who can bring real authenticity to military SF, but he is careful to leaven the novel's thunderous action with lightning flashes of humour. A pair of bogies, for instance, style themselves after the lead characters from 1980s cop show <em>Miami Vice</em>.</p> <p>Britain similarly becomes a battleground in JS Barnes's <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1789095824/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1789095824&amp;linkId=c49105dc248f5c0046e3fee3b7acb539\"><strong>The City of Dr Moreau</strong></a> (Titan, £8.99). The conflict here is between humans and Beast People, human/animal hybrids who have been secreted away in the titular subterranean city and exploited as entertainment for the moneyed classes, until they rebel and turn on their captors.</p> <p>This is just one small aspect of the novel, a sequel — of course — to HG Wells's 1896 SF classic <em>The Island of Dr Moreau</em>. Its timeline spans a century and a half, beginning before the events of the original and culminating in the near future, and the plot is packed with incident and characters, skipping from one vignette to the next like a flat stone thrown across a lake. The extrapolation of Wells's ideas is exemplary, and the prose carries a flavour of that author's discursive, sometimes fussy, style without being overindulgently imitative. As with his previous sequel to a late-Victorian masterpiece, <em>Dracula's Child</em> (2020), Barnes both updates and innovates.</p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: James Lovegrove 2021 'Genre round-up — the best in new science fiction' FT.com 25 October.
