  "text": "<p>But the Wolves hadn't won a thing. They'd merely qualified for the coming playoffs, by virtue of a \"play-in game\" victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.</p><p>The Wolves' Big Hurrah was roundly mocked. The TNT postgame show turned into a Friars roast, a giggling Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal tsk-tsking Minnesota for acting like they'd conquered a Game 7. Producers threw together a \"We are the Champions\" montage of the emotional postgame theatrics.</p><p>It was very funny. It was also a little unfair.</p><p>Do you have a Minnesota Timberwolves fan in your life? Just imagine a Cleveland Browns fan, without the rare moments of happiness. Finishes like Tuesday—they almost never happen with the Wolves. Yes, they drafted Kevin Garnett, and yes, they briefly had Jimmy Butler. But the Good Old Days weren't that good. (Garnett's championship Zenith came with the Celtics. Butler got himself out of town fast.)</p><p>The Wolves possess an all-time winning percentage of .399—that's the worst franchise mark in the history of the NBA, behind chronic disasters like the Washington Wizards, the Sacramento Kings and the Clippers. In 33 seasons, they've been in the draft lottery 23 times. They've spent so much time in the NBA basement, they've paid off the mortgage.</p><p>Needless to say, the Wolves have never won a title—they've barely sniffed a Finals. Over more than three decades, they've won a total of 18 playoff games. (As a comparison, Steph Curry has won 77 playoff games as a Warrior.) When they meet Memphis in the opening playoff round Saturday, it will be Minnesota's second playoff appearance in the past 18 seasons.</p><p>So you maybe–maybe—can empathize with why a few men jumped on tables. Basketball like this doesn't regularly occur in Minneapolis. As their loyal defenders said Tuesday, you can't scold the Wolves to \"act like they've been here before.\" They're never here!</p><p>Besides, these 2021-22 Timberwolves are a delightful bunch. They're lively and cocky and unimpressed by the competition. They're a cocktail of young electricity (20-year-old dynamo Anthony Edwards), inside-outside big man offense (Karl-Anthony Towns), streaky shooting (D'Angelo Russell) and essential physicality (veteran Patrick Beverley). They can have off nights and ugly outputs (Towns fouled out amid a disastrous performance Tuesday) but they soared in the season's second half, becoming one of the most entertaining teams in the league.</p><p>As is Memphis. It's going to be a fun series.</p><p>Many eyes are likely to be on Beverley, the 33-year-old defensive grinder who played memorable if controversial spells with the Houston Rockets and also the Clippers, which is the main reason he was so enthused about Tuesday's victory. For Pat Bev, the play-in versus L.A. was a personal revenge movie, and he reveled in seeing Steve Ballmer's team off.</p><p>Versus Memphis, it's assumed Beverly will be tasked with defending Ja Morant, the young Grizzlies sensation who was a MVP candidate until he got hurt late in the season. Morant is back for the playoffs, and now gets the headache of squaring off against a motivated pest who plays right on the edge between acceptable and unacceptable.</p><p>It might be the key to the series. On paper, Memphis is a strong favorite, the Western Conference's second seed, with more victories and a deeper roster. Morant is the best player on the court.</p><p>But the Wolves have Pat Bev.</p><p>Then there's Edwards, aka Ant, a lightning bolt out of the University of Georgia and No. 1 draft pick who is the present and future of this franchise. Edwards specializes in monster dunks, brute force, and making Minneapolis seem like it might actually be a fun place to play basketball. His presence has seemed to lift a burden off Towns, another former No. 1 who had the best offensive season of his career. It's a magical transformation, and it's made Ant the toast of the Twin Cities.</p><p>I haven't even gotten to A-Rod. Did you know Alex Rodriguez is a new part owner of the Timberwolves? Now you do, and yes, it feels super weird.</p><p>If you know a Wolves fan, don't expect much from them in the coming weeks. They're going to be locked in and busy. If Minnesota somehow gets past Memphis, brace yourselves. They might celebrate prematurely once more, without a trophy on the premises.</p><p>Don't hold it against the Timberwolves. If you suffered with this basketball team, you would do the same.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Who do you like in the series between Minnesota and Memphis?</p><p>Write to Jason Gay at Jason.Gay@wsj.com</p><p>Is It OK to Celebrate Just Making the Playoffs?
