  "text": "<p>* The Dow DJIA was up 204 points, or 0.6%, at 34,315.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX rose 22 points, or 0.5%, to 4,040.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP gained almost 58 points, or 0.5%, to 11,315.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Dow ended with a gain of slightly more than 100 points, or 0.3%, after initially jumping more than 700 points early in the session. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.7%. and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1%.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>U.S. stocks were higher at midday Wednesday as Wall Street prepared for the Federal Reserve's policy decision expected in the afternoon.</p><p>The U.S. central bank is expected to raise borrowing costs by 50 basis points to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%, with its policy statement due out at 2 p.m. Eastern time.</p><p>Market participants also expect the Fed's so-called \"dot plot\" to show projections for its 2023 terminal rate rising to 4.875%, up 25 basis points from September, according to a note Wednesday morning from Tom Essaye, the founder and president of Sevens Report Research. He said that a terminal rate of 5% or above would be viewed as \"hawkish,\" and probably weigh on stocks.</p><p>\"We think we're very close to the end of this hiking cycle,\" said Matt Stucky, senior portfolio manager for equities at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co., in a phone interview Wednesday. \"After today's hike, we're not convinced that we'll get more,\" though the Fed could do a smaller, 25 basis point rate hike in February, he said.</p><p>The Fed's previous 375 basis points of interest rate hikes since March, as it battled to suppress multidecade high inflation, have left the S&amp;P 500 down nearly 16% for the year through Tuesday.</p><p>However, equity investors have become more hopeful that signs of easing inflation, including a softer-than-expected reading from the consumer-price index on Tuesday, may allow the Fed to be less aggressive in its tightening monetary policy and potentially make a recession less likely.</p><p>See: Fed seen slowing down to quarter-point hike in February after soft consumer price inflation reading</p><p>This narrative has helped the S&amp;P 500 rally 12.4% off its 2022 closing low hit in mid-October, based on Tuesday's finish. But some analysts remain wary that such optimism may wane if faced with a resolutely hawkish Fed, a view that may explain why equities gave up a big chunk of Tuesday's initial bounce.</p><p>MarketWatch Live: Stock-market internals 'no better off today than yesterday': RenMac's deGraaf</p><p>\"The softer-than-expected inflation print in the U.S. sent the stocks higher and the U.S. dollar lower, but the S&amp;P 500 couldn't clear key resistance levels, as investors know that the Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair Jerome Powell could coldheartedly kill the market joy at his post-FOMC press conference today,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.</p><p>The consumer-price index showed that inflation rose 0.1% in November for a year-over-year rate of 7.1%. That's down from 7.7% the prior month, with the year-over-year rate falling from 9.1% in June.</p><p>Powell's news conference is due to begin at 2:30 p.m. Eastern time.</p><p>The Fed may slow its pace of rate hikes in 2023, but the central bank is \"still several months away from pausing, and even further from a pivot,\" said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note dated Dec. 13. \"And given stocks don't typically see a turning point until rate cuts are on the horizon, we still don't believe a sustained rally is likely over the next three to six months.\"</p><p>Stocks in focus</p><p>* Shares of Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL rose 3.3% after the company raised its earnings guidance and highlighted robust demand for air travel.</p><p>* Shares of Microsoft Corp. and Home Depot Inc. were among the best performing stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday morning. Microsoft MSFT was up 1.8% while Home Depot HD climbed 1.5%.</p><p>U.S. stocks rise as investors brace for Fed's interest-rate decision</p>",
