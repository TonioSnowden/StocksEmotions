  "title": "OFF DUTY --- Adventure & Travel: Beach Reads to the Rescue --- A good book can salvage even the most trying travel snafus. But not any novel will do. Here's how to pack just the right page-turner.",
  "text": "<p>\"We were down to one book, 'And Then There Were None,' by Agatha Christie,\" said Ms. Sanders, a retired teacher who lives in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. \"So we passed it between us. He read a page. Then I read the same page. We had nothing, so having that book made it better.\" In October, she and her husband will have been married for 52 years and they still think back nostalgically on that one vacation. She says she'll never forget how Dame Agatha made the experience that much sweeter and more memorable.</p><p>And so we turn to our own summer of imperfect vacations. Airports are overloaded. Hotel staff is short, as are tempers and patience. We are in a fragile state -- burnt out from three years of pandemic, social upheaval, unexpected wars in Europe and bizarre economic cycles. The perfect vacation is a pipe dream, but the perfect book need not be.</p><p>\"People say, 'Oh, I am going to the beach, I need a beach book,'\" said my friend Meg Leahy, a registrar for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., insisting that a \"beach read\" needn't be frivolous fare. \"Vacation is the time to grind into something. When else are you going to get three uninterrupted hours?\" Meg still speaks fondly of a trip to a Caribbean island, which in every way except her reading material -- Hilary Mantel's \"Wolf Hall\" -- underwhelmed her. \"That book was that vacation.\"</p><p>I recall my own holiday-gone-wrong a few years back: Our hotel, an old manor house in France's Dordogne Valley, had looked so good on the website but turned out to be cramped, moist, lit like a hospital and adjacent to a road that accommodated the occasional 18 wheeler. But I sat by the swimming pool and inhaled Nadine Gordimer's \"July's People,\" a shocking, gripping novel about war in South Africa that changed the way I see the world. I will never forget the Dordogne, and I will never curse it.</p><p>The benefits of reading are incontrovertible. Studies show it lowers blood pressure, improves memory and helps stave off dementia. Yet we seem to be turning away from reading. According to a Gallup poll, Americans are reading less, especially in the last five years. As a nation, on average in 2021, we read 12.6 books a year, down from 15.6 in 2016. And the number of relatively avid readers is decreasing: In 2021, 27% of adult Americans polled said that they read more than 10 books a year, down from 35% in 2016.</p><p>\"Literature is life-changing.\" said Maja Djikic, an associate professor of behavioral psychology at Rotman School at University of Toronto. \"It opens the mind, it increases empathy and improves interpersonal skills.\"</p><p>For anyone who has ever had to negotiate a deal, that open-mindedness is crucial. Brian Kelley of Bethesda, Md., worked has private equity for 20 years and says reading complex fiction helps him read his own world and understand it. \"The world of finance can be very narrow. Fiction helps you see things from other perspectives . . . and in some of those meetings, that's crucial.\"</p><p>Like Meg, he embraces difficult material. Last Christmas while visiting family in Florida he spent time rereading a collection of Tolstoy's short stories, while his 8-year-old frolicked on the beach. This summer he has already revisited James Joyce's \"Ulysses,\" a book he reads in part every June. For him fiction is a way to see other perspectives and reconnect with the world around him. During the pandemic it was a proxy for human interaction. \"It might not be a great substitute, but it's better than Netflix,\" he said.</p><p>And while much is written on the benefits of fiction, nonfiction can also enhance a vacation, especially if you visit a place over and over again that has deep history and culture. Brian Katulis, a policy expert from the Washington, D.C., area, first came to Rome for his 25th birthday. He loved the city but it wasn't until he read \"Caravaggio: A Life Sacred and Profane,\" by Andrew Graham-Dixon, and \"The Genius in the Design: Bernini, Borromini, and the Rivalry That Transformed Rome,\" by Jake Morrissey, that the full weight of Rome's history hit him. When he returned later in life, he saw the city in a whole new light. \"It added so many layers. I saw the tension between the cultures and artists . . . how that built a lot of the beauty we see in Rome.\"</p><p>Mr. Katulis adds that he continues to read about the places he visits, before the trip and while there. \"You can spend your time running around to recommended restaurants and the popular tourist sites and read travel guides on what to do in 36 hours in Rome. These books force you to slow your roll,\" he said.</p><p>---</p><p>Summer School / Leave the armchair at home. Six new books -- light and weighty -- to take on holiday.</p><p>THE BOOK: \"Ghost Lover\" by Lisa Taddeo</p><p>RECOMMENDED BY: Alexandra Avila, bookseller and staff recommendation coordinator at Bookworks in Albuquerque, N.M.</p><p>THE APPEAL: In this, her first series of short stories, Lisa Taddeo dissects the interior lives of powerful women in beautiful cities who are navigating the complex world of money, sex and friendships. Characters are ripped out of the headlines, some developing new dating apps and others having strange encounters at political fundraisers. Ms. Avila notes that the book has the biting wit and sharp observations of \"Fleabag\" and \"Sex and the City.\"</p><p>WHERE TO READ IT: At the swimming pool of a fancy hotel in Los Angeles or Malibu or at a beach in the Hamptons surrounded by all the beautiful people.</p><p>THE BOOK: \"Fellowship Point\" by Alice Elliott Dark</p><p>RECOMMENDED BY: Valerie Koehler, owner of Blue Willow Bookshop in Houston</p><p>THE APPEAL: Two old ladies who have been friends forever tussle over saving pristine coastline property in Maine from development. Inheritance is at stake as are legacies and literature. This book reads like something from another age, but its protagonists, Agnes Lee and Polly Wister, are decidedly modern. \"Set in Maine where the families gather each summer, [the book offers] a clear sense of place and nature. Imagine sitting on a deck when the weather is cool and the water beautiful,\" said Ms. Koehler.</p><p>WHERE TO READ IT: The coast of Maine, the Swedish archipelago or any other craggy beach of outstanding beauty.</p><p>THE BOOK: \"The Lincoln Highway\" by Amor Towles</p><p>RECOMMENDED BY: Cinnamon Dokken, owner of a Novel Idea Bookstore in Lincoln, Neb.</p><p>THE APPEAL: Fans of this book include Bill Gates who put \"The Lincoln Highway' on his summer reading list. It tells the tale of 18-year-old Emmett Watson's long drive home to Nebraska after being released from a work farm. He plans to start a new life in California but two friends from the work farm have stowed away in his car, changing the nature of the trip. Ms. Dokken calls it a \"sweeping work of Americana,\" with \"great layered storytelling,\" which makes it wonderfully nourishing on long journeys.</p><p>WHERE TO READ IT: Any road trip but especially on a cross-country drive, which may involve hours of staring out the window at miles and miles of prairie.</p><p>THE BOOK: \"Brace For Impact\" by Gabe Montesanti</p><p>RECOMMENDED BY: Audrey Kohler, a senior bookseller at BookWoman in Austin, Texas</p><p>THE APPEAL: This memoir from a St. Louis-based author dives into roller derby, a sometimes brutal team-based sport. Characters are sharp, bright and quirky. \"Montesanti weaves a story of trauma, queerness and roller-skating into this memoir -- complete with a cast of wonderful weirdos to tell a tale of her found family,\" said Ms. Kohler.</p><p>WHERE TO READ IT: Anywhere roller skating is prevalent and encouraged: the boardwalk in Venice, Calif., Bondi beach in Sydney, St. Kilda in Melbourne or the cul-de-sac in your neighborhood on a cool August night.</p><p>THE BOOK: \"Two Wheels Good: The History and Mystery of the Bicycle,\" by Jody Rosen</p><p>RECOMMENDED BY: Joanne Berg, owner of Mystery to Me in Madison, Wis.</p><p>THE APPEAL This nonfiction book investigates the much beloved bicycle and its role as a symbol of sustainability and freedom. Invented in 1817, it is a mode of transport that has come to mean as much to 6-year-olds as professional athletes. The book abounds with colorful characters, from gold prospectors biking across the Yukon to feminists biking to the protests. \"It's a blend of history and memoir all brought together by a journalist who knows his subject,\" said Ms. Berg.</p><p>WHERE TO READ IT: On a bike tour of the Canadian Rockies or France's Loire Valley, or any other scenic pedaling spot -- as a way to pump up for the next day's ride.</p><p>THE BOOK: \"Cuba: An American History\" by Ada Ferrer</p><p>RECOMMENDED BY: Mitchell Kaplan at Books &amp; Books, South Florida</p><p>THE APPEAL: Written by one of the leading historians of Cuba, this Pulitzer Prize-winner is ambitious and broad in scope. It explores the history of Cuba from the arrival of Columbus to the Trump administration, with a particular eye to America's influence on the creation of the island nation. Mr. Kaplan calls it a thrilling read, full of unexplored detail on how Cuba remains at the center of U.S. policy. \"It's a 500-page book about Cuba that is still a real page-turner.\"</p><p>WHERE TO READ IT: Any graceful Latin American city that has an outsize influence on the American imagination. Think Buenos Aires, Cartagena, Mexico City or, of course, Havana.</p><p>---</p><p>Additional reporting by Haley Velasco</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
