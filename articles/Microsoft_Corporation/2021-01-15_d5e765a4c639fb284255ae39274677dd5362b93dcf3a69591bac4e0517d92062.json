  "title": "Officer in Pro-Trump Cap Claims He Rescued Endangered Colleagues; Capitol Police lieutenant was suspended for wearing MAGA hat during Jan. 6 riot",
  "text": "<p>The officer, identified by The Wall Street Journal as Lt. Tarik Khalid Johnson, has told colleagues the images weren't what they seemed. The MAGA cap was a ruse that was part of an unusual plan to rescue more than a dozen trapped police officers during the Jan. 6 riot, the officers said he told them. And one witness said the lieutenant's action enabled a set of doors to the Capitol to be closed, shutting off an entry point to more intruders.</p><p>Lt. Johnson, 45 years old, is one of three officers suspended after rioters overran law enforcement and endangered the lives of members of Congress as they were certifying the Electoral College votes to elect Joseph Biden as president. Investigations are active into several other officers' actions that day, according to a congressional aide.</p><p>Fellow officers said Lt. Johnson, who voted as a registered Democrat in the primary in Maryland last year, isn't known to them as a supporter of Mr. Trump, and some were surprised when a picture circulated of Lt. Johnson wearing the MAGA cap during the riot.</p><p>Lt. Johnson has told fellow officers that he put on the cap in an effort to win the trust of a handful of protesters whose help he enlisted to push his way through the crowd and mount a rescue of officers trapped and in danger inside the Capitol, according to one of the colleagues.</p><p>A video taken on an iPhone 12 and reviewed by the Journal shows Lt. Johnson freeing about 16 officers from the violent mob. The video doesn't show when he put on the cap, nor where and how he got it.</p><p>Lt. Johnson didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>A Capitol Police spokesperson said the department is reviewing video and other materials of some Capitol officers who appeared to be in violation of department regulations and policies. The spokesperson didn't comment on Lt. Johnson. U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio), who leads the House Appropriations subcommittee that funds the Capitol Police, said interim Police Chief Yogananda Pittman told him that she determined that wearing the MAGA cap \"was qualifying for immediate suspension.\"</p><p>An eyewitness to the episode, Chris Jones, a former U.S. Marine Corps machine-gunner who is now a photojournalist, said he initially saw Lt. Johnson exit the Capitol. Lt. Johnson wasn't wearing a hat at that time and was accompanied by two officers in riot gear, including one who was clearly having trouble breathing, Mr. Jones said.</p><p>Later, he realized that someone had put a MAGA hat on Lt. Johnson's head.</p><p>For a period of several minutes, Mr. Jones said, Lt. Johnson was trying to address the crowd through his bullhorn. There was little or no response from the crowd, though a few people placed their hands on him and appeared to pray, Mr. Jones said.</p><p>Mr. Jones said that Lt. Johnson at one point removed the MAGA hat, and then someone else put another MAGA hat on him. The police officer didn't appear to embrace wearing the hat, said Mr. Jones, a beat reporter covering domestic terrorism at the nonprofit news organization 100 Days in Appalachia, based in West Virginia.</p><p>One of Lt. Johnson's fellow officers said that he heard him broadcasting over the police radio for permission to execute his plan, which included building a rapport with protesters and entering the building to rescue other officers from the Capitol. The officer said no one responded to Lt. Johnson.</p><p>\"Everybody was fighting their own wars,\" the officer said. The officer said that Lt. Johnson tried to do the right thing but that it was \"a stupid plan\" throughout—from putting on the MAGA cap to wanting to pull the officers out of the building into an angry mob of thousands.</p><p>Mr. Jones said he saw Lt. Johnson throw down the radio receiver in apparent frustration.</p><p>One of the officers said it is possible that Lt. Johnson, who is Black, felt very vulnerable in the mostly white mob. The officer, who also is Black, said he heard the N-word directed at him at least a half-dozen times by rioters. The attack on officers included being hit with rubber bullets, bike racks and bear spray, the officer said.</p><p>In 2012, Lt. Johnson was among officers honored for evacuating nearly 40 motorists who were trapped behind an unoccupied school bus that caught fire in a freeway tunnel near the Capitol, according to CQ Roll Call. He was treated for smoke inhalation.</p><p>The Jan. 6 iPhone video of Lt. Johnson rescuing other officers from the mob was shared with the Journal by Florida part-time filmmaker Rico La Starza, who said in an interview that he came to Washington for sightseeing. He said he ended up filming the events and posting an edited version of them on YouTube.</p><p>Lt. Johnson was already wearing a MAGA cap as the footage started. It showed him asking a man who stood with three others for help as protesters could be heard chanting, \"Fight for Trump.\"</p><p>\"We're getting beat up,\" Lt. Johnson said.</p><p>\"If you guys could help me distract these people, I'd appreciate it,\" Mr. Johnson told the man, who wasn't identified in the video. \"I need to get the other officers out. …They're scared.\"</p><p>One of the men, wearing a tan Eddie Bauer jacket and a tan cap with a faded American flag, but no apparent pro-Trump regalia, was accompanied by a man wearing a \"Trump, Keep America Great\" ball cap on top of a black winter ski cap.</p><p>\"I can help,\" said the man in the tan jacket. He then flashed what appeared to be a badge or credential.</p><p>Lt. Johnson handed the man his megaphone and said: \"I'll follow you.\" Lt. Johnson and the two men made their way toward the stairs at the east front of the Capitol, crowded by protesters.</p><p>\"Just let me hold on to you,\" Lt. Johnson told the man as the crowd thickened, and the group was jostled as it made its way up the stairs.</p><p>In the video, Lt. Johnson can be heard, speaking into his radio, that he had one of the demonstrators helping him through the crowd.</p><p>Some in the throng angrily demanded to know who they were. The man in the Trump hat at the rear of the group said, \"We're Oath Keepers. Oath Keepers.\" (The Southern Poverty Law Center describes the Oath Keepers as one of the country's largest antigovernment militia groups that believes the federal government is working to destroy the liberties of Americans.)</p><p>At the central portico door to the Capitol just outside the Rotunda, there was a brief struggle, as some in the mob resisted the group's efforts to enter. Mr. Jones said the man in the tan jacket turned around and faced the crowd and Lt. Johnson barreled past him back into the Capitol.</p><p>A man in the crowd began to repeat, \"The cops are leaving, make a hole\" for officers to pass. \"If you make a hole, we can walk in.\"</p><p>Someone else said: \"The cops are leaving. We won.\"</p><p>About four minutes later, Lt. Johnson exited the Capitol with a line of officers in body armor and riot gear in tow—to the cheers of the mob. A woman, wearing a flag-themed hoodie, hugged each of the officers as they left the building, the video shows.</p><p>The Capitol Police didn't comment when asked if the rescued officers should have stayed with their post.</p><p>Mr. Jones said he watched as some officers not in riot gear held back the mob. The officers had shut one of the large, wooden-and-glass ornamental doors, but heavyset men in the mob held open the other door. As soon as the officers in riot gear left, officers inside the building managed to close the door, preventing anyone else from breaching that entrance.</p><p>Once the door was closed, Mr. Jones said, \"the people start shouting, 'It was a trick; they're tricking us.' And there was a surge back to the door.\" By then, the police had secured the entrance.</p><p>The crowd began shouting racist epithets, Mr. Jones said, but Lt. Johnson had already walked down the Capitol steps.</p><p>Lisa Schwartz and Coulter Jones contributed to this article.</p><p>More on the Capitol Riot and Trump Impeachment</p><p>* Federal Agencies, Congress Launch Reviews Into Handling of Capitol Riots</p><p>* Start Date of Trump Impeachment Trial Still Uncertain</p><p>* Latest Updates: The Capitol Riot</p><p>Write to Tawnell D.
