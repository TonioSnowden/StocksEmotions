  "text": "<p>Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, the former top lieutenant to Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes, was sentenced to nearly 13 years in prison for his involvement in an elaborate fraud scheme at the blood-testing company. Mr. Balwani appeared in federal court Wednesday after beingconvicted in July on all 12 fraud charges he faced.</p><p>The government had requested a 15-year imprisonment for Mr. Balwani. His attorneys had asked for probation.</p><p>Mr. Balwani was convicted after a three-month trial in federal court in San Jose, Calif. Prosecutors argued thathe defrauded Theranos investors and patients by lying about the capabilities of Theranos's finger-prickblood-testing technology.</p><p>Who is Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani and what does he have to do with Theranos?</p><p>Mr. Balwani, 57 years old, was the chief operating officer and president at Theranos, a startup that claimed it could test for more than 200 health conditions using only a few drops of blood extracted from a finger prick. Mr. Balwani worked at Theranos from 2009 to 2016, and he oversaw the company's lab and served as vice chairman of the board. He was Ms. Holmes's closest confidant.</p><p>The theranos saga</p><p>* Early revelations</p><p>* An early Balwani profile</p><p>* Theranos coverage</p><p>* Elizabeth Holmes on trial</p><p>* A who's who</p><p>According to testimony from his trial, Mr. Balwani had enormous power and influence at Theranos. He made decisions about lab practices and policies, controlled access to the lab, hired and fired employees and was in charge of financial projections provided to investors. Former Theranos employees testified that Mr. Balwani and Ms. Holmes made decisions in unison about how to run the company.</p><p>Mr. Balwani and Ms. Holmes were more than colleagues—they were in a romantic relationship that spanned more than a decade, although they kept it secret from many employees, board directors and investors. The pair ran the company in tandem, through its rise to a company valued at more than $9 billion and its eventual downfall.</p><p>Theranos dissolved in September 2018.</p><p>How did Mr. Balwani's trial relate to the trial of Elizabeth Holmes?</p><p>His verdict was the second conviction against Theranos leadership and came six months after a jury found Ms. Holmes guilty of fraud, securing another major victory for the U.S. government, which brought the case against the pair in 2018. A federal judge severed the case in March 2020, leading to separate trials with separate juries.</p><p>Mr. Balwani faced 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud related to deceiving patients who took Theranos blood tests and investors who put money into the company, according to the government's indictment. These are identical to the original charges Ms. Holmes faced, although near the conclusion of her trial one of the charges related to a Theranos patient was dropped because of an error by the prosecution.</p><p>Ms. Holmes was found guilty on Jan. 3 on four counts. She was acquitted on four counts, and the jury hung on the remaining three.</p><p>What was Ms. Holmes's sentence?</p><p>Ms. Holmes, who was convicted of defrauding investors, was sentenced in November to more than 11 years in prison, capping the extraordinary downfall of a onetime Silicon Valley wunderkind who promised to revolutionize blood testing.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Edward Davila, who oversaw the trials of both Ms. Holmes and Mr. Balwani, ordered Ms. Holmes to serve 11 years and three months, and to surrender on April 27, 2023. The sentence length falls in the midrange of those received by the dozen white-collar criminals with similar offenses cited by the government in its sentencing memorandum.</p><p>Ms. Holmes appealed the court's decision in her case last week, and her opening brief is due March 3 with the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco. She has asked to remain out of prison pending her appeal.</p><p>What was Mr. Balwani's sentence?</p><p>Judge Davila ordered Mr. Balwani to serve 12 years and 11 months, and to surrender on March 15, 2023. The result is an unusual white-collar criminal punishment for Mr. Balwani: being sentenced to a longer prison term than his former boss, who was at the center of the fraud at her company.</p><p>\"The evidence shows he knew about the fraud,\" Judge Davila said ahead of reading the sentence.</p><p>What did Mr. Balwani do before Theranos?</p><p>An immigrant from a long line of farmers, Mr. Balwani studied information systems at the University of Texas, graduating in 1990, and got a master's degree in business administration in 2003 from the University of California, Berkeley, his lawyer said.</p><p>Mr. Balwani is a veteran tech executive who worked in software, including at Lotus and Microsoft, but much of his wealth derived from work at an earlier startup. In the dot-com boom, he helped run e-commerce startup CommerceBid.com, which was acquired in 1999 for roughly $228 million in cash and stock. Mr. Balwani received shares as part of the deal that he sold for more than $40 million, based on a lawsuit he later filed against a tax adviser.</p><p>He used his own money as collateral when he guaranteed a $12 million loan to Theranos in 2009, and he later invested in the company.</p><p>Mr. Balwani has shown a penchant for fancy cars, and had a personalized license plate that read \"DASKPTL,\" a nod to Karl Marx's tome Das Kapital, according to court filings. He didn't have experience in pathology or laboratory science before running Theranos's lab, prosecutors have said.</p><p>His ex-wife, Japanese artist Keiko Fujimoto, divorced him in 2002 in San Francisco Superior Court, the same year he met Ms. Holmes. </p><p>Ms. Holmes was convicted of fraud and sentenced to more than 11 years in prison. PHOTO: Josh Edelson for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>What was the relationship between Mr. Balwani and Ms. Holmes?</p><p>Ms. Holmes and Mr. Balwani had a secret romance as well as a professional alliance. They met in 2002, when Ms. Holmes was still a teenager and Mr. Balwani was 37, while in China as part of a language immersion program, according to Ms. Holmes's lawyer. Mr. Balwani later supported Ms. Holmes's decision to drop out of Stanford University and start the company that would become Theranos, Ms. Holmes testified in her trial.</p><p>They lived together from 2005 to 2016, at one point buying a house in Atherton, Calif., a tony Silicon Valley enclave, for $9 million, according to evidence presented in Ms. Holmes's trial.</p><p>The couple split in 2016, around the time Mr. Balwani left Theranos. After they broke up, he sometimes would show up at the church Ms. Holmes attended at night or at the place where she used to go running at Stanford University, she testified.</p><p>What did Ms. Holmes say about Mr. Balwani in her trial?</p><p>In the most gripping testimony from Ms. Holmes, she accused Mr. Balwani of emotionally, psychologically and sexually abusing her for years, alleging that he controlled what she ate, how much to sleep, and when she could spend time with her family and friends. She described a relationship in which she was pressured to live up to his exacting standards and was punished when she failed. She testified that at times Mr. Balwani forced her to have sex.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Balwani denied all allegations of abuse.</p><p>The story ILLUSTRATED</p><p>* The Testimony of Elizabeth Holmes: Regret, Revelations and Deflections</p><p>Ms. Holmes read text messages aloud in court that she had exchanged with Mr. Balwani, in which they expressed love and devotion to each other. She called him \"My nirvana,\" according to the messages, and he told her, \"I worship you.\"</p><p>Ms. Holmes testified that Mr. Balwani was in charge of the lab and had assured her that everything was in order, and she was stunned when a regulatory inspection found numerous deficiencies—contradicting evidence from the prosecution that Mr. Balwani had warned her that the lab was a \"disaster zone.\" Ms. Holmes also testified that she was ultimately responsible as CEO, and Mr. Balwani didn't control what she said to investors, business partners, board members or journalists.</p><p>What did Mr. Balwani say during his trial?</p><p>Mr. Balwani didn't testify in his trial. Ms. Holmes's allegations of abuse didn't resurface in his trial, and she wasn't called as a witness.</p><p>Mr. Balwani showed no emotion as the verdict was read, and looked periodically at his lawyer. He said nothing as he left the courthouse walking alongside his lawyers and trailed by family members.</p><p>Jeffrey Coopersmith, Mr. Balwani's lawyer, said: \"We are obviously disappointed with the verdicts. We plan to study and consider all of Mr. Balwani's options, including an appeal.\"</p><p>This explanatory article may be periodically updated.</p><p>Write to Heather Somerville at heather.somerville@wsj.com</p><p>Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani: Who Is the Former Theranos President and What Was He Convicted Of?</p>",
