  "text": "<p>Eddy Elfenbein, the portfolio strategist of the AdvisorShares Focused Equity ETF and editor of the blog Crossing Wall Street, decided to look at the correlation between inflation-adjusted bond yields and stocks.</p><p>“If someone says that the stock market is cheap or expensive, naturally you need to ask, compared to what? For judging stocks, the 10-year Treasury yield is a good starting place. The problem with looking at Treasury yields is that inflation can greatly impact them. That's where [Treasury inflation-protected securities] come in because these bond yields are adjusted for inflation,” he says.</p><p>Since 1983, he found that on days when the 10-year TIPS yielded 1.67% of higher, the stock market, as measured by the Wilshire 5000 XX:W5000, has had a negative return. But when yields have been zero or lower, the stock market has delivered an average return of more than 38%.</p><p>The tipping point appears to be 0.5% — when the yield on the 10-year TIPS is at least 0.5%, the stock market return has been 5.1%; but when it's lower, the stock market has delivered gains of 23.3%.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year TIPS, on Tuesday, was -1.05%, which is close to a record low. “For now, the bond market is signaling more good news for stocks,” said Elfenbein.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>Chinese President Xi Jinping did not accept an invitation to meet from U.S. President Joe Biden, the Financial Times reported.
