  "title": "Technology:  Microsoft Slows Some Hiring Amid Uncertainty  ----  By Aaron Tilley",
  "text": "<p>   Microsoft Corp. said it would be slowing some of its hiring, making it the latest tech giant to become more cautious about adding staff. </p><p>   The Redmond, Wash., company said it would reduce the pace of hiring for the software group that develops its Windows, Office and Teams applications. The group had been one of the company's fastest-growing divisions in recent years. </p><p>   The move is in response to growing economic uncertainty as the company approaches the end of its financial year in June, a spokesman said. </p><p>   \"As Microsoft gets ready for the new fiscal year, it is making sure the right resources are aligned to the right opportunity,\" a spokeswoman said. \"Microsoft will continue to grow head count in the year ahead, and it will add additional focus to where those resources go.\" </p><p>   Even as the company plans to expand its overall headcount, new hires for the software group will have to be approved first by upper management, Microsoft Executive Vice President Rajesh Jha, who heads the software group, told employees in an email Thursday. Previously, upper management's approval wasn't required for hires. </p><p>   While the pace of hiring may be falling, Microsoft has pledged better pay for employees. Earlier this month, the company told staff it would be boosting compensation, in part in reaction to challenges created by low unemployment and high inflation. </p><p>   Microsoft has to compete for talent in the cloud market, where its rivals Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google announced similar bumps in employee compensation. </p><p>   The pandemic has been an accelerant for Microsoft's cloud-based software products. For the quarter through March, Microsoft reported revenue rose 18% to $49.4 billion. Its overall cloud business was up 32% with $23.4 billion in sales. </p><p></p>",
