  "title": "A Top Gas Producer Considers Cutting Exports. Its Timing Couldn't Be Worse. Australia could demand some exporters redirect natural gas to domestic buyers, straining global energy supply further",
  "text": "<p>Europe's energy crisis has elevated the importance of stability of energy supply from Australia, one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas following a multibillion-dollar investment spree that took place around a decade ago. Australia accounted for a fifth of global liquefied-natural-gas exports last year and while most of its supply is committed to buyers in Asia, companies can choose to sell a portion of their output into the open market when prices are high.</p><p>However, business leaders and regulators warn Australia is facing a gas shortage of its own, which could feed inflation and restrain its economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Longstanding energy problems in the country's east, such as output falling from aging gas fields, have intersected with recent setbacks including flooding in coal-mining regions that led Australian power plants to use significantly more gas instead. As a result, wholesale energy prices in the country's biggest electricity market tripled in the three months through June.</p><p>Gas producers have sought to capitalize on high energy prices by selling more LNG in one-off deals. LNG typically fetches a higher price than what domestic buyers are prepared to pay for their gas supply. The Australia Pacific LNG project in eastern Queensland state, which counts ConocoPhillips and Origin Energy Ltd. as major shareholders, delivered five spot cargoes of LNG between April and June. That accounted for a third of all cargoes sold by the project on the spot market in the 12 months through June, Origin said.</p><p>Companies exporting their uncommitted supply is alarming the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the country's consumer watchdog. This month, the commission urged the government to work with producers to immediately redirect LNG intended for export or risk a major gas shortfall next year. It said the expected deficit is equivalent to about 10% of domestic demand on the east coast and that manufacturers could close if action wasn't taken.</p><p>\"This is a significant deterioration in conditions relative to what we projected for 2022 at the same time last year and presents a real risk to Australia's energy security,\" the commission said in a report.</p><p>Under a mechanism established several years ago when some of Australia's biggest states were roiled by power blackouts, the government can require gas producers to prioritize domestic demand at competitive terms. The emergency powers have never been used, but lawmakers this month said they could use the mechanism to head off a shortage next year.</p><p>Not all LNG projects would be affected if the government decides to activate the mechanism. There isn't a pipeline that can ship gas from the country's west where many LNG plants are located to major cities such as Sydney in the east. Instead, the focus would be on three gas-export projects in Queensland: the Australia Pacific LNG facility and nearby plants operated by Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Santos Ltd.</p><p>Resources Minister Madeleine King said she intends to ask producers to provide information on their output, planned export volumes and market outlook. This feedback will help determine whether the mechanism is triggered, she said.</p><p>\"This is their opportunity to demonstrate that there won't be a domestic shortfall next year,\" she said.</p><p>Australia's gas industry has warned the government that it risks damaging the country's reputation if it imposes temporary limits on how much producers can export. In a recent submission to the government, Santos called for the current mechanism to be scrapped because its project would be the only one materially hurt if it was used.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Shell said the mechanism is an important short-term tool that helps customers to feel confident that gas would be available. Still, Shell said further intervention risks future investment in developing gas supplies, which would affect prices.</p><p>\"Australia needs to be very mindful of any signals sent by any policy changes to our longstanding trade and investment partners around the world who have invested in the Australian economy because of our stability,\" said Damian Dwyer, deputy chief executive of the Australian Petroleum Production &amp; Exploration Association.</p><p>By warning of a looming gas shortage, the consumer watchdog was merely signaling that action is needed and the industry is ready to ensure reliable supply, he said.</p><p>\"Threats of any shortfall of gas are overblown,\" said Frank Calabria, Origin's chief executive in a LinkedIn post this month. \"We have been in this situation before, and the industry has always responded.\"</p><p>Mr. Calabria said Australia Pacific LNG supplied more gas to the domestic market than any of its competitors.</p><p>Still, business leaders are nervous. Mark Vassella, chief executive of BlueScope Steel Ltd., said high energy prices could make it harder for Australian industry to compete globally.</p><p>\"It terrifies me about the longer-term impact, where people pack up their tent and go home, because it's just too hard and no one's making enough money,\" said Mr. Vassella.</p><p>Concerns around future gas shortages partly reflect policy settings that the gas industry argues have stifled investment in production. For years, some eastern states didn't allow production of natural gas from coal seams, even as some conventional gas fields became depleted.</p><p>The gas industry says it is investing to prevent gas shortages happening in future, although permitting and mobilizing construction teams mean it can be years before new projects start up. Santos this month said it expects to begin building a pipeline in early 2024 that could take gas produced from coal seams at its Narrabri project in eastern Australia. Other new or expanded pipelines are planned by competitors.</p><p>A more ambitious project to boost east coast gas supply involves shipping in LNG from elsewhere in the country and even from overseas. Those looking to import LNG include a company owned by Andrew Forrest, Australia's richest man, and Viva Energy Group Ltd., which counts energy trading company Vitol as its major shareholder.</p><p>Write to David Winning at david.winning@wsj.com and Rhiannon Hoyle at rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com</p><p>A Top Gas Producer Considers Cutting Exports.
