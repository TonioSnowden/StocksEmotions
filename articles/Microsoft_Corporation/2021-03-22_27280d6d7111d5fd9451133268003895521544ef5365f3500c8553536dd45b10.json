  "text": "<p>The disclosures, which the White House made available on request through an online portal, detail staff members' and their spouses' assets, stock portfolios, income, nongovernmental positions and debts for 2020 through when they joined government service this year.</p><p>Some of the ties might pose an early test of how the Biden administration is interpreting its ethics pledge, which mandates that appointees commit to not participating in any matter \"involving specific parties that is directly and substantially related to my former employer or former clients, including regulations and contracts.\"</p><p>It isn't unusual for senior government officials to have ties to prominent business, as every modern administration has drawn from the private sector to fill top posts. President Donald Trump's initial batch of White House advisers and cabinet officials drew from the oil industry, Wall Street and his personal real-estate and licensing business, among other sectors.</p><p>The new Biden White House disclosures particularly highlight recent ties between national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Microsoft.</p><p>Mr. Sullivan is overseeing an interagency effort to address a recent cyberattack on Microsoft's Exchange email software, which the company said was carried out by a network of suspected Chinese hackers. Microsoft's network was also accessed in the recently unearthed suspected Russian hack of at least nine federal agencies and scores of private businesses.</p><p>Before entering the administration, Mr. Sullivan, a former campaign aide to Hillary Clinton, served on an advisory council for Microsoft from 2017 through May of last year, according to his disclosure. In that role, he was paid $45,000 last year as part of the council's work advising the company's president on \"key policy developments,\" the disclosure says.</p><p>In response to questions about Mr. Sullivan's disclosure, a White House official said that while Mr. Sullivan is dealing with the national-security consequences of the Microsoft Exchange hack, deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger is leading the National Security Council's response.</p><p>---</p><p>Rice Assets Total at</p><p>Least $37.9 Million</p><p>Susan Rice, who leads the White House Domestic Policy Council, listed assets of at least $37.9 million in financial disclosures released Saturday for some senior White House staff.</p><p>The former Obama administration national security adviser and United Nations ambassador resigned in mid-December as a member of the board of directors at Netflix Inc. and indicated in her filing that she is in the process of liquidating stock options acquired after joining the streaming company in 2018. The sale of less than a third of those options in August netted her $305,275.</p><p>Her portfolio includes shares in the Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers Pfizer Inc. and Johnson &amp; Johnson. She listed shares of between $1 million and $5 million in Johnson &amp; Johnson, while reporting between $15,001 and $50,000 in Pfizer. On Saturday, a White House official said Ms. Rice isn't involved in the administration's decisions related to Covid-19 vaccines.</p><p>Ms. Rice listed almost $638,000 in speaking fees earned during 2020, including more than $128,000 after President Biden's election.</p>",
