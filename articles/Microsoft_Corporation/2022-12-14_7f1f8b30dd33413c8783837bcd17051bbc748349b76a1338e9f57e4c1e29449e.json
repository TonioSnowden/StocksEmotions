It is a slower pace than its four consecutive 0.75 point rate hikes since June.</p><p>See: Fed hikes interest rate by half percentage point — benchmark rate seen topping out at 5.25%</p><p>Market participants also digested the central bank's \"dot plot,\" which is the individual FOMC member's expectation of the appropriate Fed Funds rate each year, to provide markets with a broad indication as to where and when the central bank is likely to pause its current rate hike cycle.</p><p>Fed officials penciled in 5.25% as the top end for its benchmark rate throughout 2023. That's higher than their forecast of 4.75% in September. Seven Fed officials expect rates to go even higher, with two seeing rates topping out at 5.75%.
