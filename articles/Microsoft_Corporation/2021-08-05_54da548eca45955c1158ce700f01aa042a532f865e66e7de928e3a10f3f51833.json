  "text": "<p>One thing to start: Joe Biden wants <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fbc2d70-5365-4d3b-97ec-cea2756de28d\">half of the cars</a> sold in the US to be electric by 2030. </p> <p>Welcome back to another Energy Source. Our first note today sticks with the US Senate's big bipartisan infrastructure bill and the forthcoming budget package. These are the critical legislative vehicles for the Biden energy agenda. Myles McCormick has a useful explainer on what comes next. </p> <p>Our second note is an opinion piece from Bill Farren-Price, a veteran Opec watcher, who argues that oil markets are underestimating the significance of the attack on a vessel off Oman on Saturday.</p> <p>Data Drill is on sticky costs in the offshore wind business.</p> <p>Thanks to Calgary readers who got in touch. I'm still in the city, so I am still keen to hear from people for a piece I'm writing about Alberta's energy business (<a href=\"mailto:derek.brower@ft.com,\">derek.brower@ft.com</a>). By the way, this has been a summer of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe4e658e-0473-4f98-b995-4606aefa90bc\">extreme weather</a> across North America's west, especially in British Columbia and the Pacifica North-West of the US. But are others alarmed at the smoke and heat in Alberta? It doesn't feel like the Canadian prairie summer weather of my childhood. </p> <h1>‘I've never seen anything like it': Democratic party factions complicate Biden's energy plans</h1> <p>Joe Biden entered office with sweeping promises to overhaul America's energy landscape even though the politics of doing so were never going to be simple.</p> <p>Much has been made of the bipartisan infrastructure bill set to be passed by the Senate in the coming days. But even if that makes it into the statute books — which is not yet guaranteed — it only represents a fraction of the president's ambitious climate agenda.</p> <p>The way forward now rests on internal Democratic party politics. Battle lines have been drawn between spending-averse moderates and progressives demanding a no-holds-barred approach to tackling climate change.</p> <p>Does Democratic infighting risk an implosion of the president's climate plans? Today we take a look into the headache-inducing politics of it all.</p> <h2>Where do things stand now?</h2> <p>The infrastructure bill — hashed out by the White House and a cross-party group of senators — will almost certainly be passed in the upper chamber by the end of next week, before the summer recess begins.</p> <p>The proposed legislation will face some minor amendments, but the crux will look more or less the same as what was released last weekend: big money for the power grid, nuclear, carbon capture, hydrogen and electric vehicle infrastructure. (See Derek's takeaways from the 2,702-page bill in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5882cbf-27b7-47d2-b000-2218e2b6e190\">Tuesday's newsletter</a>.)</p> <p>The bulk of Biden's plans for sweeping change, however, are nowhere to be found.</p> <p>Environmentalists certainly aren't satisfied. John Bowman, managing director for government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, says it “sets the stage for [the] main act”.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“Far more is needed, though, to confront climate change head on and&#xa0;set the country on track to cut its carbon footprint in half by 2030, as the crisis demands,” he said.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Where's the rest?</h2> <p>The “main act” will come in the form of what's known as a budget reconciliation bill.</p> <p>Using this legislative process would allow Democrats to push through the more ambitious elements of Biden's climate plan — including a clean energy standard (CES) forcing America's utilities to shift away from carbon, and an unprecedented level of clean energy tax credits — without the need for Republican support. </p> <p>But there are caveats:</p> <ol>  <li><p>Reconciliation is reserved only for tax and spend measures. Crafting a CES to fit this description will be tricky.</p></li>  <li><p>Democrats have only the slimmest of majorities in the Senate, so every single vote counts. And more moderate voices aren't crazy about the idea of a massive spending surge.</p></li> </ol> <p>Chuck Schumer, Senate majority leader, wants to pass a “budget resolution”, which would effectively put a price tag on the reconciliation bill, by the end of next week. Bernie Sanders, chair of the budget committee, has proposed a figure of $3.5bn. But at least one Democrat — Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona — has already said she won't support a number that high.</p> <p>Joe Manchin of West Virginia also has concerns about the price tag and has said he won't vote for a CES that hurts the coal industry — which is essentially the point of a CES. </p> <h2>Battle lines drawn</h2> <p>If the moderate wing of the party is providing a headache for the president, the liberal wing is compounding it.</p> <p>Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, says she won't pass the infrastructure bill in the lower chamber until the Senate has passed the full reconciliation bill. But hammering out the details of that far bigger bill could take months, analysts say.</p> <p>“It's an extremely unusual state of affairs,” said Paul Bledsoe, strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute and former Clinton White House adviser. “I mean, I've never seen anything like it in 35 years in Washington.”</p> <p>Pressure will mount on Pelosi to soften her stance. But progressives such as New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are hardening. Speaking on CNN on Sunday, she said:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“If there is not a reconciliation bill in the House and if the Senate does not pass a reconciliation bill, we will uphold our end of the bargain and not pass the bipartisan bill until we get all of these investments in.”</p> </blockquote> <p>And activists are increasing the pressure. Eden Alem, a spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement, a youth led climate campaigning group, told ES:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“Democratic leadership must pass at least the $3.5tn reconciliation bill, which must include all of our climate policies, before any bipartisan infrastructure bill. Progressives and young people have been clear: no climate, no deal and we will hold those in power accountable.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Should the reconciliation bill pass in anything like its current form it will usher in radical change: the CES would remove carbon from the grid by 2035; and the roughly $300bn spent on tax credits alone would be almost 10 times the package pushed through by the Obama administration in 2009. </p> <p>“It's an economically transformative agenda that will hasten the clean energy transition faster than anything else in history,” said Bledsoe. “And if it passes, it will essentially fulfil all Biden's climate policies.”</p> <p>Given Democrats' continuing stand-off, that's a big “if” . . . <em>(Myles McCormick)</em></p> <h1>Tanker wars: show of force</h1> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47221a8a-8660-403e-b07e-713f93c7233a\">hijacking of the Asphalt Princess</a> oil tanker in the Gulf of Oman this week, days after a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9539f8d-3505-4340-93ec-42a6343cd211\">separate deadly attack</a> believed by the UK and Israel to have been backed by Iran, marks a clear escalation in the Gulf tanker wars. The incidents reveal a high-stakes gambit by Ibrahim Raisi's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f3e2221-77b2-4118-ba1f-fb9324469f9b\">new hardline administration</a>, which took over the presidency this week. </p> <p>The attacks were intended to demonstrate Iranian strength in the face of international isolation, but they carry the risk of retaliation — even if western powers' options to respond are limited. Iran's claims of plausible deniability are being stretched to the breaking point.</p> <p>For the oil market, the events are significant. Just as nuclear talks between Iran and the international community brought the possibility of an end to sanctions — and the bearish potential for more Iranian crude flowing on to the market — the attacks throw a new spanner in the diplomatic works. Not that traders appear too concerned: oil prices are continuing to fall amid growing concerns about the Delta variant.</p> <p>Above all, these new tanker wars make it more difficult to keep treating the diplomatic track as discrete from Iran's regional activities, something that Tehran has always insisted on.</p> <p>It would also be wise to remember the pressures facing Iran's new president and its Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. </p> <p>The country's leadership is acutely aware that public resentment to the government is building. Protests and strikes over Iran's limited water supplies and other public policy failures — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5bb73713-6587-4e2a-bf1a-3e90c0a8d35b#post-046656e7-0100-4c41-95dc-67bc82ed4a39\">including the handling of Covid-19</a> — are gaining momentum nationwide. </p> <p>Turnout in June's elections was at a record low with moderate and even mainstream conservative candidates removed from voting lists. </p> <p>Raisi needs an economic win as much as a political win — and he needs both quick. A deal that allowed oil exports to restart would tick both boxes. A show of strength before a pragmatic deal that keeps Iran's nuclear programme battened down seems the best explanation. It's a high-risk strategy but one that makes sense for Raisi domestically.</p> <p><em>(Bill Farren-Price is a director at Enverus, an industry consultancy</em>)</p> <h1>Data Drill</h1> <p>Renewable energy proponents have argued that with innovation and scale-ups, wind energy will become <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/923de0ae-b72e-4106-9688-c549b6bb1690\">cheaper to generate</a> over time. Not so, says a new <a href=\"https://thundersaidenergy.com/2021/07/29/offshore-wind-will-costs-follow-moores-law/\">report</a> from Thunder Said Energy. It examined UK projects from the past 15 years and found that costs increased 2.5 per cent each year. This finding stands in contrast to expectations of the International Energy Agency, for example, which expects the costs of offshore wind to fall two-thirds by 2050.&#xa0;</p> <p>Nevertheless, the future of offshore wind remains bright. Generation is <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/06/210630115413.htm\">expected</a> to grow 15-fold by 2040 and become a $1tn industry. The report recommends that wind developers take on projects in countries with low wind penetrations, have realistic ideas about costs, and build sensibly-sized turbines. The report found that while wind turbines have been getting bigger and bigger, doubling in size every decade, they aren't necessarily getting better. Larger turbines are more likely to degrade and use more carbon-intensive materials. <em>(Amanda Chu)</em></p> <h1>Power Points</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Wildfires are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f89c759-eb9a-4dfb-b768-d4af1ec5aa23\">threatening</a> BP and Microsoft's carbon offsets.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>How Stanford graduates are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/72db9c01-e0be-4f78-8ae7-6f9613ff5119\">repurposing</a> unwanted carbon dioxide.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Germany's Green party gains <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c98900e-0612-47eb-9ceb-40b364433a95\">support</a> as the country grapples with climate change.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Germany is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/business/electric-trucks-catenary-wire.html?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Climate+news%3A&amp;utm_campaign=TDC+Daily\">testing</a> out electric highways.
