  "title": "The Five Most Dreaded Words at the Office: 'Let's Start a Google Doc'; Shared documents are a workplace minefield of performance anxiety and awkward interactions",
  "text": "<p>\"I operate out of a private doc,\" says Mr. Snyder, 37, who lives in Atlanta. \"I don't want even the sense of someone looking at me work.\"</p><p>More than three billion people use Google Workspace products like Docs and Sheets, according to the company. Many of them seem to dread it.</p><p>The workplace ritual tends to go something like this: You're minding your own business, trying to write a proposal or plug numbers into Google Sheets, when the mood shifts. A small circle materializes near the top of the screen. The avatar belongs to a colleague, or worse, your boss. The discomfort can be heightened by the appearance of any number of anonymous animals, which Google auto-assigns to people who open a Doc without being signed into their account: anteater, wombat, quokka.</p><p>The cursor starts flashing. Questions abound: What are this person's intentions? Will they scroll down far enough to see the garbled notes at the bottom that you haven't deleted? Why on earth are they online at 1 a.m. on a Saturday? And what is a quokka?</p><p>Like many others, Mr. Snyder works in a shadow copy so he can toil over a single sentence for half an hour without fear of anyone spying on his creative process. Once every word is perfect, he pastes the finished product back into the shared doc. He says he doesn't mind if people check on the original and wonder why he hasn't made any progress. It's better than the alternative.</p><p>\"We've had clients that think it's appropriate to edit as you're writing,\" he says. \"The fact that I can be in a shared doc and see an anonymous platypus, or all the other animals just hovering there—I'm like, 'I can't.' \"</p><p>Kyle Bazinet, 34, who works as a government policy adviser in Toronto, recently completed a 10-page strategy analysis for an infrastructure project and shared it with three higher-ups. He planned to sign out of the document immediately, but as he saw his senior colleagues' avatars pop up one by one, his curiosity got the better of him.</p><p>\"I watched them go line by line,\" he says. \"It was impressive and terrifying at the same time to see how quickly they were able to pick something apart that I'd been working on for days.\"</p><p>The experience may have been a bit of shared-document karmic retribution. \"I do have a reputation for liking to destroy people's work,\" he says.</p><p>Google says in a written statement: \"The future is flexible, and the value of Docs means that people can work and collaborate together from anywhere—when it works for them—despite any friction people may feel about collaborating with a colleague or an anonymous armadillo.\"</p><p>Vishnu Sivaji, group product manager for Google Workplace, which includes Google Docs, says the company recognized during the pandemic that many people were working with colleagues they had never met face to face, and might be meeting for the first time in a document's comments.</p><p>In recent months, the product team has added features to reduce tension and increase human connection, including the ability to leave emojis in place of a comment.</p><p>\"I now see people, who are very senior VPs, leaving emojis on my documents,\" he says.</p><p>Mr. Sivaji's most embarrassing moment in a shared doc happened before he worked on the product. He was preparing separate proposals for two competitors and accidentally shared partner A's proposal with partner B.</p><p>\"Now we have very clear guidance when you're sharing a document outside your domain,\" he says.</p><p>Early in the pandemic, Meisha Bochicchio, 32, was taking notes for a virtual meeting attended by the C-suite executives at her company. Each executive had access to the document and was signed in, following along. After the meeting, Ms. Bochicchio jumped on a call about a job offer from another company she had been interviewing with.</p><p>\"My first thought was I needed to take notes about this quickly,\" she says.</p><p>Without looking up to see which tab she had opened, she started typing out details of the new position, including the salary and start date. In the middle of the call, it dawned on her she was still typing in the original document. She saw the avatars of all the executives at the top of it, still signed in.</p><p>\"I don't notice this for, like, 10 minutes,\" says Ms. Bochicchio.</p><p>Five days later, while preparing her resignation letter, she got a call from her boss's boss.</p><p>\"She just was straight up, 'So I saw you took some interesting notes,' \" recalls Ms. Bochicchio, who lives in Boston. \"Obviously not the most professional look.\"</p><p>Phantom lurkers have haunted Danielle Slakoff, a 32-year-old assistant professor of criminal justice at California State University, Sacramento, who uses Google Docs to collaborate on research. Ms. Slakoff says that one of her research partners, Lauren Moton, always seems to be in the doc, despite being three hours ahead in New York.</p><p>\"She does work all the time,\" Ms. Slakoff says. \"She's working in the evening hours on this when I'm doing this in the early afternoon.\"</p><p>That was a surprise to Ms. Moton, a 31-year-old doctoral candidate who says she sets strict boundaries and doesn't work past 7 p.m.</p><p>\"I never close my tabs,\" she says. \"Right now I'm looking at my computer and I probably have 30 tabs open, 80% of which I haven't looked at in the last week.\"</p><p>Even when Ms. Moton is plugging away on the project, she works out of Microsoft Word documents and pastes the finished text into Google Docs. Years ago, as a research assistant, she was writing a brief after hours when a director signed in and started editing. The brief had been full of spelling errors and was in no way ready to be viewed.</p><p>\"I see her little cursor moving around,\" says Ms. Moton. \"After that I was completely scarred.\"</p><p>Kathie Dello, 39 years old and the state climatologist of North Carolina, says that one benefit of graduate school was getting her writing torn apart so much that it inured her to any feelings of self-consciousness about working in front of an audience. \"I rarely do anything on my own,\" she says.</p><p>Recently while working on a climate report in Microsoft Teams, the system experienced an error and would no longer save her changes. She wondered if the culprit was the volume of people making edits at once. \"There was too much collaboration for the document,\" she says.</p><p>\"Though things like document permissions and connectivity issues can occasionally interfere, there's nothing like collaborating with colleagues across different time zones or ZIP Codes,\" Microsoft says.</p><p>The Five Most Dreaded Words at the Office: 'Let's Start a Google Doc'</p>",
