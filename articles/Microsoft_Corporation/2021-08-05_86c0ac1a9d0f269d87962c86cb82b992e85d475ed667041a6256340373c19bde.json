  "text": "<p><strong>Provençal charm</strong></p> <p>I'm writing this at a time when it feels possible that a late-summer, quarantine-free holiday in southern Europe may yet emerge as an undertaking somewhat less difficult to execute than a K2 ascent or polar expedition. Just in time to fuel that optimism, two buzzy names in French hospitality have planted flags in opposite corners of Provence. In the hills outside St&#xa0;Tropez, the Airelles group (which has resorts and chalets in Gordes, the Val d'Isère and Courchevel, as well as the only hotel in the grounds of Versailles) has commandeered the historic <a href=\"https://airelles.com/en/destination/chateau-de-la-messardiere-hotel\">Château de la Messardière</a>. After a two-year renovation, the 25-acre, 103-room property reopened last month with a Valmont Spa, a raft of tailored experiences – from perfume-making workshops to guided cycling expeditions – and Matsuhisa Saint-Tropez, Nobu Matsuhisa's pop-up, in residence until October. To the northwest, in the Vaucluse, <a href=\"https://www.beaumier.com/en/properties/le-moulin-hotel/\">Le Moulin de Lourmarin</a> has just opened in the absurdly picturesque village of the same name. A sister to the supercool <a href=\"https://www.beaumier.com/en/properties/les-roches-rouges-hotel/\">Les Roches Rouges</a> on Cap Esterel, housed in an 18th-century olive-oil mill, it has just 25 rooms, remade (“under-made”, and beautifully so, might be more accurate) with natural tones and spare furnishings by Marine Delaloy and Paula Alvarez de Toledo of Paris-based Jaune. A casual bistro is similarly sleek, while the flagstone terrace, shaded by limes, delivers the old-world Provence feels. <a href=\"https://airelles.com/fr\"><em>airelles.com</em></a><em>, from €1,150; </em><a href=\"https://www.beaumier.com/en/\"><em>beaumier.com</em></a><em>, from £111</em></p>  <p><strong>Tall story</strong></p> <p>Nairobi's <a href=\"https://www.thesafaricollection.com/properties/giraffe-manor/\">Giraffe Manor</a> is already the stuff of bucket lists and social-media saturation (witness the 74,000 #giraffemanor posts on&#xa0;Instagram). It's a very private hotel, and the experience of sharing breakfast with its&#xa0;population of leggy ruminants (known to&#xa0;reach their heads through the breakfast-room windows to inspect what's on offer) has historically been limited to guests. But last&#xa0;week its&#xa0;owners, The Safari Collection, opened <a href=\"https://www.theluxurysafaricompany.com/the-retreat-at-giraffe-manor/\">The&#xa0;Retreat at Giraffe Manor</a>&#xa0;– a sprawling multipurpose complex on the same sanctuary, with extensive wellness facilities, a restaurant and rooftop bar-garden, and day rooms for TSC guests. The giraffes won't be breakfasting here, but you're likely to socialise with them next to the 21m infinity pool. <a href=\"https://www.thesafaricollection.com/\"><em>thesafaricollection.com</em></a><em>, day rooms from $800, day passes from $250</em></p>  <p><strong>Pretty in ice pink</strong></p> <p>Italy's tourism numbers haven't come close to recovering to pre-pandemic levels (some would say a good thing); but development is moving apace. Ennismore's Hoxton group, which nails it style-wise at locations from <a href=\"https://thehoxton.com/amsterdam/\">Amsterdam's Herengracht</a> to <a href=\"https://thehoxton.com/paris/\">Paris's 2nd arrondissement</a>, chose the unorthodox Roman neighbourhood of Salario for <a href=\"https://thehoxton.com/rome/\">The&#xa0;Hoxton Rome</a>, its first Italian digs –&#xa0;belle époque houses, adjacent to swanky Parioli, and pretty much zero truck with cobblestones and monuments. But the word is very positive, from superlative eating (thanks to a partnership with <a href=\"https://marigoldroma.com/\">Marigold</a>, long a favourite of expats and Roman chefs/food editors alike) to a terrace garden and sleek, midcentury-inflected rooms. Meanwhile, in September, <a href=\"https://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/romwv-w-rome/\">W Hotels</a> will make its first foray into Italy in an ice-pink palazzo on the other side of the Villa Borghese. The pinnacle of chic once upon an early-'90s time, the W brand had lost much of its cachet. Marriott, its parent company, hopes to totally reboot it in the Eternal City, with Sicilian superchef Ciccio Sultano overseeing culinary offerings, a rooftop bar with 360-degree views, and decor that channels ebullient <em>Man from U.N.C.L.E. </em>style. <a href=\"https://thehoxton.com/\"><em>thehoxton.com</em></a><em>, from €160; </em><a href=\"https://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/romwv-w-rome/\"><em>marriott.co.uk</em></a><em>, opens in September, from €400</em></p>  <p><strong>In with the inn crowd</strong></p> <p>And, for the 2022 wishlist, a new address in&#xa0;Australia: a sweet little <a href=\"https://www.berrimavaulthouse.com/\">restaurant-inn-members' club</a> in the historic town of Berrima, in New South Wales' Southern Highlands – all bucolic rolling hills and chic farm shops. Built in 1844, Berrima Vault House has been restored by a team of culinary and hospitality consultants led by&#xa0;sometime Soho House Group creative director, Dan&#xa0;Flower; Ali Hillman, who oversaw Paul Allen's public-art programme at Microsoft, has curated the art. Along with the members' spaces, there's a&#xa0;series of indoor and outdoor working areas, dining venues and bars, a rambling rose garden, and The Courthope residence, whose very pretty ensuite bedrooms afford guests access to all members' facilities. <a href=\"https://www.berrimavaulthouse.com/\"><em>berrimavaulthouse.com</em></a><em>, from AU$600 (about £325</em>)&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mariashollenbarger/?hl=en\"><em>@mariashollenbarger</em></a></p><p>Source: Maria Shollenbarger 2021 'Travel news: chic new hotels to fly for' FT.com 5 August.
