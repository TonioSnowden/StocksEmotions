  "title": "Kenyans Vote in Tight Race Amid Shifting Alliances and Struggling Economy; Memories of previous election disputes that have turned violent loom over the election",
  "text": "<p>\"We're praying we don't go that way again,\" said Isaiah Mwange, a 38-year-old shopkeeper standing in line to vote at a Nairobi polling station.</p><p>Polls suggest a tight vote. Election officials spread around the country of 55 million people have up to a week to submit results to the tabulation center in Nairobi. Official results are expected within a few days, as are claims of vote rigging by the loser.</p><p>Kenya is abastion of relative stability and economic strength in East Africa, a U.S. ally in the fight against al Qaeda's al-Shabaab franchise in Somalia and a base for Alphabet, Inc., Microsoft Corp. and other major companies.</p><p>President Uhuru Kenyatta, whose father Jomo Kenyatta is considered the founder of independent Kenya, has reached the end of his two-term limit. He endorsed a former political rival, five-time presidential candidate Raila Odinga, 77, over his own deputy president, 55-year-old William Ruto.</p><p>Many voters see Mr. Odinga, whose own father was a key player when Kenya won independence from Britain in 1963, as the candidate of status quo stability. Mr. Ruto portrays himself as the choice for \"hustlers,\" working-class Kenyans trying to scrape by in the informal sector of the economy.</p><p>The election may prove a test of whether Kenya has moved from volatile politics based on ethnic affiliations to politics based on economic and other issues, including the fight against the corruption woven through the political system.</p><p>\"What's important is for people to elect their leader and after that go back to work,\" said pharmacy owner Susan Wachira, 59. \"Without peace, you can't do business.\"</p><p>Voters lined up at the balloting tents at the Kenya Technical Trainers College in Nairobi on Tuesday morning said they hoped whoever loses is gracious in defeat and whoever wins is magnanimous in victory.</p><p>\"I just want to go back to my home, have internet, water and electricityâ€”and sleep peacefully,\" said Yvonne Acha Ouma, 28, a compliance attorney with an insurance company.</p><p>Some complaints of technical glitches surfaced on Tuesday morning, particularly involving fingerprint readers used to identify voters. \"It is not widespread,\" elections commissioner Justus Nyanga'ya told reporters at a briefing in Nairobi. \"Technology does break down.\"</p><p>Prof. George Wajackoyah, 62, an outsider candidate running on a platform of legalizing marijuana, told reporters that an equipment failure delayed his ability to vote in his home county in western Kenya.</p><p>Mr. Wajackoyah's support among young Kenyans could give him enough votes to force an October runoff between the two leading candidates, polls suggest. To win outright, the leader must receive the majority of votes nationwide and at least 25% of the vote in 24 of Kenya's 47 counties.</p><p>Many Kenyans are concerned about kitchen-table issues such as the high prices of corn meal and gasoline, driven upward in part by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Both countries were major food exporters to Africa before the war cut supply lines.</p><p>In Kenya, the situation has been complicated by a regional drought of unprecedented ferocity, which has killed livestock and crops, leaving 3.5 million Kenyans facing hunger in the country's north.</p><p>\"I'm opting for someone who will help us revive the economy,\" said Mr. Mwange, the shopkeeper.</p><p>Write to Michael M.
