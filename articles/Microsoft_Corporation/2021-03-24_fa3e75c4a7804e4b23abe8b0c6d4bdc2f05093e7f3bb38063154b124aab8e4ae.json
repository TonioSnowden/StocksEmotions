  "title": "Intel: cold war heats up domestic chip production plans",
  "text": "<p>Wall Street has soured on Intel in recent years, turning its attention to flashy new semiconductor upstarts instead. Now that Intel is the beneficiary of goodwill in Washington and a cold war in Asia, investors are scurrying back. On Tuesday, the US microprocessor legend announced an ambitious plan to expand its global chips business. Intel <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/987b5761-6b59-48f3-8f52-52a4fb84264e\">will spend $20bn</a> to build two additional fabrication plants in Arizona. It also plans to build a “foundry” unit that will manufacture chips for third party, “fabless” designers.&#xa0;</p> <p>Intel's waning manufacturing prowess has led at least one investor to suggest it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/800c65a5-d3fc-47cb-bcaf-2088cd68b0ec\">get out</a> of making its own chips. Recently appointed chief executive Pat Gelsinger is making the opposite bet. It is made easier by the US president's tacit backing. Semiconductors have become a proxy battle between the US and China. Joe Biden has made domestic capabilities a key priority. </p> <p>According to data shared by Intel, nearly half of global chip sales occur in the US, though American production is only about a tenth of the total. That proportion has dropped with the rise of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05206915-fd73-4a3a-92a5-6760ce965bd9\">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company</a> and other manufacturers in Asia. Tension with China means Washington is willing to spend taxpayer money to ensure vital supply chains remain in the US.&#xa0;</p> <p>Gelsinger claims Intel's ability to keep up with cutting-edge chip manufacturing is improving. The company also said that its 2021 revenue and profits will exceed previous forecasts based on strong laptop PC demand. This is a nice boost along with the long-term strategy shift. Intel shares are up 27 per cent this year while the S&amp;P 500 is up just 4 per cent. The $15bn forecast for annual free cash flow makes the $20bn capital commitment seem reasonable.&#xa0;</p> <p>Despite its status as tech pioneer, Intel has taken a back seat to a resurgent Microsoft and other Silicon Valley upstarts. Now it is going supersize. Google was one of several tech luminaries to offer a statement of support for Intel's strategy shift. After Washington, that may be the most important endorsement of all.</p> <p><em>Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice weekly.
