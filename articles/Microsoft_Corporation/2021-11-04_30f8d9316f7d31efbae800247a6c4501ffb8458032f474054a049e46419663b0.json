  "text": "<p>   Google is pursuing a cloud-computing contract with the Department of Defense, nearly three years after abandoning a similar bid process in the face of employee protests. </p><p>   The head of the Alphabet Inc. subsidiary's cloud division, Thomas Kurian, met this week with Pentagon officials to discuss the bid process for a contract called the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability, according to people familiar with the meeting. Google's interest was earlier reported by the New York Times. </p><p>   The three-year contract replaces the 10-year, $10 billion JEDI cloud-computing contract terminated in July. </p><p>   The JEDI project was mired in years of squabbling between Microsoft Corp., which won the bidding, and Amazon.com Inc., which contended the process was politically motivated under the Trump administration. </p><p>   In 2018, Google came under fire from employee activists over a Pentagon contract to supply imaging tools used by drones. Several outspoken employees quit. </p><p>   The company later abandoned the contract and pledged not to allow its artificial-intelligence products to be used in military weapons. </p><p></p>",
