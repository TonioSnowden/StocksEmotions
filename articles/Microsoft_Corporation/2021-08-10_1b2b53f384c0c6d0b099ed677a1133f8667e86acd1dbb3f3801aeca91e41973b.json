  "text": "<p>Mukesh Ambani's Reliance has led a $144m fundraising by US energy storage start-up Ambri, as part of the Indian group's plans to manufacture batteries in its home market.</p> <p>Reliance New Energy Solar said on Tuesday it would invest $50m in Ambri and that the two were in talks “to set up a large-scale battery manufacturing facility in India, which could add scale and further bring down costs for Reliance's green energy initiative”. </p> <p>As the world looks to increase deployment of renewable energy to combat climate change, large stationary batteries are emerging as a key technology to help grids integrate electricity from solar and wind sources, whose output is intermittent. </p> <p>Tuesday's deal is the latest in a series of tie-ups between large industrial groups and start-ups seeking to develop energy storage technology.</p> <p>ArcelorMittal last month <a href=\"https://formenergy.com/form-energy-unveils-chemistry-of-multi-day-storage-battery-technology/\">announced</a> it had invested in Massachusetts-based start-up Form Energy, which is developing an iron-based battery to store renewable energy cheaply for up to 100 hours. </p> <p>Ambani said the Ambri battery would be part of Reliance's plans for a 5,000-acre green energy complex in Jamnagar, which will produce solar panels, hydrogen electrolysers and batteries.</p> <p>“Reliance Industries sees this strategic partnership with Ambri as an important step in its journey of achieving its decarbonisation goals,” he said. </p> <p>Ambri said some of the money raised would fund the design and construction of manufacturing facilities in the US. </p> <p>Hedge fund Paulson &amp; Co and Ambri's largest shareholder Bill Gates also participated in the fundraising, along with new investors Fortistar, Goehring &amp; Rozencwajg Associates and the Japan Energy Fund.</p> <p>Ambri's technology uses electrodes made of calcium and the semi-metal antimony, separated by a molten salt electrolyte. On heating to 500C, the liquid metals combine while charging and reseparate when discharging. </p> <p>The company said its batteries, which can store energy cost-effectively for up to 24 hours and have a lifespan of up to 20 years, could allow solar energy generated during the daytime to be used at evening or morning peak load times. </p> <p>Ambri also announced it had signed a deal with the mining company Perpetua Resources, which is backed by Paulson, for the long-term supply of antimony. </p> <p>Perpetua is looking to develop the Stibnite Gold Project in central Idaho, which it says can provide a domestic source of antimony. </p> <p>“This agreement is a meaningful step in support of the current administration's goal of achieving 100 per cent clean electricity in the US, while prioritising the domestic manufacturing of battery technology,” said Laurel Sayer, chief executive of Perpetua Resources. </p><p>Source: Henry Sanderson 2021 'Reliance backs US energy storage start-up Ambri in $144m fundraising ' FT.com 10 August.
