  "text": "<p>\"Given today's [Wednesday's] downside reversal and a continued lack of any capitulatory signals, we think the path to the June lows (3,640) might be faster than many anticipate,\" BTIG's chief market technician Jonathan Krinsky tells clients, though he dangles some hope.</p><p>\"The bad news is we are still in one of the weakest seasonal windows of the year, especially in a midterm year. The good news is that it quickly reverses by mid-October. We think we test or break the June lows before then, which should set up a better entry point for a year-end rally,\" said Krinsky.</p><p>Investors would be forgiven for feeling like they've been backed into a corner right now when it comes to investment options. That brings us to our call of the day from Credit Suisse, which offers a \"protective moat for uncertain times\" via dozens of companies with solid business models.</p><p>Note the bank is currently recommending an underweight stance on equities owing to \"potential downside risk to 2023 earnings estimates to the tune of 15% to 20% for the S&amp;P 500.\" They see a \"highly uncertain\" growth outlook caused by aggressive central bank responses to sticky wage growth and Europe's energy crisis. Strategists expect U.S. growth to reach just 0.9% in 2023, with a 0.2% contraction in the eurozone.</p><p>Still, Richard Kersley, head of global equity research and his team asked analysts across several regions to \"identify companies whose earnings may not be immune to, but should be better shielded from economic uncertainty thanks to the high barriers to entry that surround their businesses.\"</p><p>\"Stocks selected reflect examples of companies that have shown a superior ability to innovate, their first mover advantage or simply a scale advantage that has developed a market leading position and with it stronger pricing power,\" he said.</p><p>And rather than limiting picks to defensive sectors or styles, they cast a wide net and come up with 35 outperform-rated stocks with an \"economic moat across regions.\" Bolded names represent those with above-consensus earnings estimates and target prices, as well most anti-consensus calls.</p><p>Americas: Air Products APD, Autodesk ADSK, McDonald's MCD, Microsoft MSFT, NextEra NEE, PPL PPL, Reynolds REYN, Hershey HSY, Thomson Reuters TRI, Union Pacific UNP, Visa V.</p><p>EMEA: Air Liquide FR:AI, ASML ASML NL:ASML, Assa Abloy SE:ASSA.B, Coloplast DK:COLO.B , Diageo UK:DGE DEO, Edenred FR:EDEN, Experian UK:EXPN, Haleon UK:HLN, Legal &amp; General UK:LGEN, LSEG UK:LSEG, National Grid UK:NG , Reckitt Benckiser UK:RKT, Schneider FR:SU, Sika CH:SIKA, Smurfit Kappa IE:SK3, Wolters Kluwer NL:WKL.</p><p>Asia Pacific: AIA HK:1299, CP All PCL TH:CPALL, CTOS Digital MY:5301, Hindustan Unilever IN:500696, Intl Container PH:ICT, PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk , Samsung Biologics KR:207940, Samsung Electronics KR:005930</p><p>Check out Day two of MarketWatch's Best New Ideas in Money Festival.
