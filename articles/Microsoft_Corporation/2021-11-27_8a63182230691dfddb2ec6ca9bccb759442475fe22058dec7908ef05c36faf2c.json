  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Economy Challenges Tech Giants In China",
  "text": "<p>Their latest challenges contrast with the robust results posted by some of their American peers, including Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Microsoft Corp., which were buoyed by a shift to online shopping and remote work amid the pandemic. While Amazon's quarterly sales growth slowed amid supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages, both Amazon and Google said demand for their digital-ads businesses was strong.</p><p>Chinese internet platforms have already been dealing with new policies that more strictly control areas like data collection, algorithms and minors' time online.</p><p>\"The question is whether those platforms are set up to service merchants in what you would describe as recession-proof or crackdown-proof industries. And there's not many of those at this point in time,\" said Michael Norris, research and strategy manager at Shanghai-based consulting firm AgencyChina.</p><p>China's economy grew 4.9% in the third quarter from a year earlier, falling short of economists' forecasts and slowing from the previous quarter's 7.9% expansion rate. Growth has been weighed down by a host of factors including power shortages, supply-chain issues and a crackdown on private sectors including technology, real estate and education.</p><p>For some Chinese internet giants, the slowdown has translated into weaker demand for digital advertising.</p><p>Tencent's third-quarter online advertising revenue rose 5% year-over-year, slowing from 23% growth in the previous quarter, as a result of tighter regulation in areas like education, insurance and online videogaming. Other industries have been slow to pick up the slack, executives said.</p><p>\"Other categories will leap into the gap and sort of backfill and take advantage of the lower prices,\" said James Mitchell, Tencent's chief strategy officer. \"I think that will happen over time, but in a more challenging macro environment, it happens less quickly.\"</p><p>On Friday, Beijing's top regulator published draft rules for the internet advertising industry, including prohibiting after-school training ads targeting young students and holding advertisers and internet platforms accountable for ad content.</p><p>Baidu Chief Strategy Officer Herman Yu said the weakness in ad revenue would likely persist beyond the third quarter, particularly if pressures from Covid-19 shutdowns and regulation continue. China has recorded a very small number of Covid-19 cases compared with other countries, yet sporadic outbreaks have continued to result in temporary halts on travel and business.</p><p>Other companies are looking to diversify growth drivers as China's economy flags.</p><p>Alibaba said its July-September earnings suffered from slowing domestic consumption as well as increased competition, and expects fiscal 2022 revenue to increase 20% to 23%, compared with its forecast of nearly 30% in May. The company has said it is looking to cloud computing and international commerce as areas of growth. Meanwhile, Baidu said its core revenue was driven by a 73% year-over-year rise in cloud computing.</p><p>---</p><p>Raffaele Huang and Anniek Bao contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
