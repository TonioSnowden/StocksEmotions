  "title": "Late-Afternoon Rally Lifts Stocks --- Indexes three-day percentage gains are largest since November 2020",
  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 added 30.99 points, or 0.7%, to 4546.54. Its three-day percentage gain sits at 5.1%, its largest since November 2020.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 273.38 points, or 0.8%, to 35405.24. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 106.12 points, or 0.7%, to 14346.00. Both indexes also finished with their largest three-day percentage gains since November 2020.</p><p>The winning streak follows a turbulent start to the year. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 closed out January with a 5.3% loss, its largest since March 2020. The Nasdaq fell further, losing 9%.</p><p>Driving the January selloff was growing anxiety among investors over how the stock market will hold up as monetary policy tightens. The Federal Reserve last week signaled that it would begin raising rates in mid-March, prompting traders to shuffle their portfolios. Many dumped shares of highflying companies and shifted to stocks and funds that felt safer, such as dividend stocks.</p><p>The start of a new month, though, has brought fresh earnings reports and economic data for investors to parse. Some investors say they hope that last month's volatility is, at least temporarily, behind them. Many still expect 2022 to be a choppy year, as investors continually re-evaluate their portfolios to account for higher interest rates ahead.</p><p>\"We have relatively good economic conditions, in terms of much-higher-than-normal GDP growth, a strong labor market and consumers and companies with strong balance sheets,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. \"But you have those big headwinds of the Federal Reserve raising rates and reducing [its] balance sheet. I think investors are trying to decide what's a good level. . .for buying some dips but also making sure they are prepared for potential volatility down the road.\"</p><p>Mr. Zaccarelli said he prefers to reposition into higher-quality companies with good profitability. He said he has found opportunities in financials and energy.</p><p>Money managers say they are looking closely at earnings for clues about how companies are navigating issues surrounding inflation and the supply chain. This week, some earnings reports have showcased strong results. Exxon Mobil gained $4.87, or 6.4%, to $80.83 after it reported $23 billion in profit for 2021, its highest total since 2014.</p><p>Shares of United Parcel Service rose $28.48, or 14%, to a record $230.69 after it reported a rise in quarterly profit. U.S.-listed shares of Switzerland's UBS Group rose $1.73, or 9.3%, to $20.40 after the bank lifted its financial targets and said it has the firepower to buy back as much as $5 billion in shares this year.</p><p>\"One of the themes of this year was that earnings would be a main driver of the market,\" said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services. Some 77% of S&amp;P 500 companies that reported results before Tuesday's close beat earnings-per-share expectations, according to FactSet data.</p><p>Data released Tuesday showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowed last month. The Institute for Supply Management's Manufacturing Report on Business's Purchasing Management Index decreased to 57.6 -- a reading above 50 generally signals expansion -- in January from 58.8 in December. The report showed that the Covid-19 Omicron variant and supply-chain impediments were among the issues that weighed on activity.</p><p>A separate report from the Labor Department said hiring and the number of worker resignations slowed in December from the month before.</p><p>Of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors, energy stocks posted the largest gain. The industrials, financials and materials groups were also among those that saw strong performances.</p><p>Megacap tech stocks, in contrast, traded mixed. Microsoft lost $2.22, or 0.7%, to $308.76. Netflix jumped $29.99, or 7%, to $457.13. Tech companies suffered during January's selloff as rising interest rates threatened their pricey valuations, which rely on expectations for growth far in the future.</p><p>\"Tech came into the year very, very expensive, making it all the more vulnerable to an increase in rates,\" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. \"It makes sense that it has had that selloff, but for tech you have to be a long-term investor and think about the trends going forward.\"</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.799% from 1.780% on Monday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>At 5 p.m. in New York, bitcoin traded at $38,741.35, up $297.81 or 0.8%. Among other cryptocurrencies, ether traded at $2,790, up $109.29, or 4.1%, and dogecoin traded at 14.2 cents, up 0.7%.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.3%.</p><p>Early Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei was up 1.6% and Australia's S&amp;P ASX 200 was up 1.2%. Markets in China, South Korea and other Asian centers were closed for Lunar New Year. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.4%, Dow futures were down 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.9%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
