  "text": "<p><strong>UK house prices</strong> continue their upward march. Prices reached another new record in November after a pick-up in the pace of growth, data from Nationwide Building Society show. </p> <p>Prices rose 0.9 per cent between October and November, Nationwide said, well above the 0.5 per cent economists polled by Reuters had expected. That compares with a 0.7 per cent rise in October. House prices are now 10 per cent above their level a year ago and 15 per cent above their pre-pandemic level of last March, with the average price now £252,687. </p> <p>Cheap borrowing, high demand and a shortage of properties for sale have helped shore up prices despite the end of the stamp duty holiday, which saved homebuyers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6fe856c-6aa6-4801-a08e-75182dae0c3f\">roughly £6.4bn in taxes</a>. </p> <p>Nationwide chief economist Robert Gardner said that while there had been some signs of a cooling market, with the number of transactions down almost 30 per cent year-on-year in October, activity had been “extremely buoyant” this year and “underlying activity appears to be holding up well”. A sobering thought: the number of transactions so far this year is roughly in line with 2007. </p> <p><em>Tell me what you think. Email us at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"mailto:citybulletin@ft.com\"><em>citybulletin@ft.com</em></a></p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Peel Hunt's </strong>investment banking division had a record six months in the run-up to the broker's IPO, it said in its half-year results this morning. Investment banking revenue rose 43 per cent to almost £33m thanks to the dealmaking boom. Pre-tax profits fell by half, but they were weighed down by costs associated with its listing and the company said outlook for future growth was positive. </p> <p>The <strong>private equity</strong> takeover battle for UK software maker <strong>Blue Prism</strong> has taken a new turn, with the board withdrawing its backing for a bid from <strong>Vista Equity Partners</strong> and instead throwing its lot in with a new offer from <strong>SS&amp;C Technologies</strong>. The SS&amp;C's offer values Blue Prism's equity at £1.24bn (£12.75 a share); Vista's previous offer was for £1.21bn (£12.50 a share). If you're not up to speed on this one (I can't blame you) do check out Bryce's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fcdac98c-69ba-4655-85b0-20c39e4b5daa\">very nice column</a> from September. </p> <p>Biomass energy producer <strong>Drax</strong> said adjusted earnings would be around the top end of analysts' expectations. The company has a capital markets day for investors today.</p> <p>Car dealer <strong>Pendragon</strong> upgraded its full-year profit forecast from £70m to £80m after a smaller than expected shortfall in the number of new cars available in October and November and the continuing boom in used car prices. </p> <p>And <strong>KPMG</strong> has been threatened with a ban on bidding for UK government contracts, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/692cf095-18e3-4cbf-8827-7903c743ea29\">Michael O'Dwyer reports</a>, after a series of scandals left the Cabinet Office nonplussed. The department made the threat in a letter seeking assurances there would be no further misconduct at the firm, which was the third biggest winner of public sector consulting contracts in the latest financial year. </p> <p>Also out today are updates from <strong>Loungers</strong>, the café and bar group, media company <strong>STV Group</strong>, and another acquisition by Martin Sorrell's <strong>S4 Capital</strong>. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Microsoft's </strong>shareholders have overwhelmingly backed a protest vote over sexual harassment claims, calling on the tech group to reveal more about its handling of allegations. The vote followed years of complaints from some workers that Microsoft had brushed pervasive claims of harassment under the carpet, and the revelation that co-founder Bill Gates had a relationship with an employee, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c70997f-d044-4a58-9e1e-1122282967f8\">Richard Waters reports</a>.</p> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> boss <strong>David Solomon</strong> has warned New York City's status is not guaranteed, cautioning that high taxes threaten its position as a global business destination. “At the end of the day, incentives matter, taxes matter, cost of living matters,” Solomon <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b85aee90-de35-4a6e-a645-eb9622dca954\">told the FT Global Banking Summit</a>, after the pandemic prompted some residents to move to lower-tax states such as Florida.</p> <p>The executive leading <strong>Meta</strong> (formerly Facebook)'s faltering digital currency project, <strong>David Marcus</strong>, has announced he is quitting. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1aed893-7254-42bd-870b-c2bd1b45a939\">Dave Lee reports</a> that he will leave the group at the end of the year after a series of setbacks in its attempts to launch ambitious cryptocurrency products including a new digital token, Diem.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>Two comment pieces to recommend today: the first is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/847b0335-7835-4b4f-9dc6-39ba944baadc\">from Paul Marshall</a>, chair of <strong>Marshall Wace</strong>, on how <strong>London</strong> risks becoming a global backwater of stock exchanges as fund managers obsess on dividends over growth. </p> <p>And the second is from my colleague Helen Thomas on how the sale of the <strong>UK's flagship vaccine manufacturing centre</strong> smacks of short memory syndrome. It needs to attach safeguards, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2986f544-b3b6-4fa5-9dff-fea9132be466\">she says</a>. </p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'UK house prices hit a new high' FT.com 1 December.
