  "text": "<p>\"Just having a stable career, being able to take care of my daughter and be a positive role model for her, that was all part of my fresh start in changing my career,\" said the 41-year-old, who lives in Chandler, Ariz., with her daughter, now 8 years old. \"I wanted to be someone that she would admire for being strong and not settling in life.\"</p><p>Ms. Bennett also credits a fateful call to a customer-service hotline for prompting her to take steps toward a career change.</p><p>As a teenager, Ms. Bennett harbored dreams of becoming a computer animator. She attended the Art Institute of Philadelphia in 1998, but left after a year. \"It was not exactly what I thought it was going to be,\" she said.</p><p>Soon after, while working at a cafe, she was approached by a customer about an office job. Ms. Bennett interviewed for and landed the administrative assistant job, launching what would become a 20-year career in administrative roles at various companies.</p><p>\"I always felt that I was good at what I was doing, but it wasn't ever something that I truly loved,\" she said. \"I never actually felt that most of the jobs that I was doing was a career. I felt that was a means to make ends meet.\"</p><p>Ms. Bennett started a jewelry business as a side hustle in 2005, hoping to turn it into a career. She developed a website, adding e-commerce in 2009. \"I just taught myself to do it by going online and learning by reading,\" she said.</p><p>Years later, when her 2006 marriage began to deteriorate, she paused her jewelry business and put effort into making a career change. \"I had a feeling of being trapped in dead-end administrative positions and being trapped in my marriage,\" she said.</p><p>Ms. Bennett took on some freelance web-design projects for others, sometimes for free, as a way to gain experience while learning more about web development. The experiences made her want to return to school. \"Over the years I regretted not finishing college and having what I felt was a stable career doing something I chose or was passionate about,\" she said.</p><p>Then came the interaction that set her vague thoughts about maybe one day going back to school into action. While working on a freelance website project, she had to contact customer service for the program she was using to get help in resolving an issue that required technical expertise she didn't possess.</p><p>\"I wanted to set a certain style on a specific page which was not a default option and could only be handled through adding custom code, which I had not done,\" she said. \"They were like, 'well, you need a web developer to help you with this.' \" At that moment, a lightbulb went off in her head. \"That should be me,\" she thought to herself. \"I should be a web developer.\" She immediately started researching schools.</p><p>She spotted an advertisement on Facebook for a Google developer scholarship. In 2017, she applied, got accepted and enrolled in Udacity, an online course provider.</p><p>In that same year, she filed for divorce. She took courses while working full time as an administrative assistant, earning a certificate Udacity calls a Nanodegree in 2018. Her divorce was finalized a year later, making Ms. Bennett her household's sole breadwinner.</p><p>\"So I, with my new skills, updated my resume and my LinkedIn profile and started networking like crazy to find a new job,\" Ms. Bennett said. \"I spent a lot of time researching companies I wanted to work for and made a top-three list,\" she said. \"I sent a heartfelt letter to those three companies explaining the stage I was in with my career and learning journey and expressed why I wanted to work for them while continuing to learn.\" Sandoval Agency, based in Chandler, hired Ms. Bennett as a digital project manager in 2019, allowing her to gain real-world experience in the field before making her way toward her goal job.</p><p>\"It is the best decision of my life,\" she said. \"I am immensely happier doing what I do now.\"</p><p>It isn't lost on Ms. Bennett that something she started as a side hustle inadvertently led to a second career. \"I just think that having built my first website many years ago, it's all come full circle.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Making The Move</p><p>Name: Typhaney Bennett</p><p>Age: 41</p><p>Location: Chandler, Ariz.</p><p>Education: Certifications from specialty online schools including a Front-End Developer Nanodegree certificate from online learning platform Udacity.</p><p>Former job: Administrative assistant for a diamond retailer.</p><p>New job: Front-end web developer for digital marketing firm Sandoval Agency.</p><p>Aha moment: A call to customer service to help solve a design challenge while working on a freelance website development project made her acknowledge gaps in her knowledge, prompting her to go back to school and pursue a web-developer career.</p><p>Most important piece of advice for changing careers: \"Network and get to know what you're getting into. Meet people that are doing the things that you're doing.\" That might mean joining professional communities whose members are in the same field, through websites or apps like Meetup and Shapr.</p>",
