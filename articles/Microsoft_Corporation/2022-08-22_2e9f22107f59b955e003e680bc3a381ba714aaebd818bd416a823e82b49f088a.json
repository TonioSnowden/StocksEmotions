  "text": "<p>Tangen told the Financial Times that Norges Bank Investment Management, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund with $1.2 trillion in assets, faces an average of three serious cyber-attack attempts every day.</p><p>\"We're seeing many more attempts, more attacks [that are] increasingly sophisticated,\" he said.</p><p>The fund's deputy chief executive Trond Grande referenced the 2020 hacking of software provider SolarWinds, which allowed Russian state-backed hackers to access companies such as Microsoft and Deloitte and a number of U.S government agencies including the Pentagon.</p><p>\"They estimate there were 1,000 Russians [involved] in that one attack, working in a coordinated fashion. I mean, Jesus, that's our whole building on one attack, so you're up against some formidable forces there,\" Grande said.</p><p>The Oslo-based fund, which was set up in 1996 to invest Norway's energy earnings, recorded its worst ever loss in the first half of 2022, shrinking by $174 billion or 14.4%. The loss was driven by recession fears impacting tech stocks, such as Meta, it said last Wednesday.</p><p>Norwegian sovereign wealth fund chief says he's more worried about cybersecurity than markets, even after $174 billion loss</p>",
