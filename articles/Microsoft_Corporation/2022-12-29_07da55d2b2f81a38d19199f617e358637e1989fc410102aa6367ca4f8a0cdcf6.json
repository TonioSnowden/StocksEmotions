  "text": "<p>For the art market, 2022 was a year of taking risks, most of which paid off, as a tough 2023 loomed into view. The most obvious was Christie's staking its own money to win the prestigious collection of late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen — with a guarantee of around $1bn. It turned out to be a sound bet. The auction house managed to offload much of its guarantee to third parties ahead of the sales and fielded the highest-value auction ever — a $1.5bn haul from just 60 works on November 9, with another $116mn the following day.</p> <p>“Even if we had known the economic context would be more challenging by the end of the year, we wouldn't have done it differently,” says Guillaume Cerutti, chief executive of Christie's. “This type of collection was always going to perform well.” Bidding was deep — Christie's says there were 5.6 bidders per lot, a high number in a forum that only needs two to get going — while the auction house also reports 30,000 visitors to its in-person previews and 4mn online viewers for the sales. “In terms of the image and reputation for Christie's, that's worth many communication campaigns,” Cerutti says.</p> <p>The Paul Allen sale helped motor the art market to what is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5cc5e24b-1e1f-496b-92ff-8751ec237c60\">likely to be its strongest year since records began</a>, based on auction results released so far, though we won't know for sure until all the numbers get crunched in March. Other collections that did well this year, bringing in more than $100mn apiece, included those belonging to the dealers Thomas and Doris Ammann, New York arts patron Anne Bass, lawyer David Solinger and fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy, an auction that cemented the power of Paris in the art market. Despite the uncomfortable economic and political backdrop, the combination of brand-name art from brand-name collections proved irresistible to the wealthy, while guarantees kept the consignments coming. “Great quality doesn't grow on trees,” says private dealer Emma Ward.</p> <p>The seeming disconnect with the outside world was made stark at the London season in early March. Held within days of Russia's merciless invasion of Ukraine, these sales turned over more than £500mn, the season's strongest total since 2018. The top price was £59.4mn for René Magritte's “L'empire des lumières” (1961) at Sotheby's.</p> <p>With some older-generation dealers seemingly ceding their powers, most notably Marian Goodman (now in her nineties), other gallerists are staying in growth mode, perhaps hoping to capture some big-name artists — it was the already-mega David Zwirner who hit the jackpot this month, taking over Goodman's representation of German heavyweight Gerhard Richter.</p> <p>Galleries, dealers and collectors are back on the road, attending as many fairs as possible, despite the pandemic promise to reduce such events. New fairs, from old hands Art Basel and Frieze, came to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a35c5ef-844f-4b68-b106-f52bd2d5f6d0\">Paris</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21908e67-cbe5-4734-be72-218159ddccab\">Seoul</a> respectively this year and increased momentum in both capitals. “I have been travelling like a lunatic,” says Ward, who this year set up her own business in partnership with Moretti Gallery.</p> <p>Art Basel helped power Paris to another strong year as the city vies with London as a European hub. “Buyers here have changed a lot, they are more international and younger, the Paris market has come a long way,” says Nicolas Orlowski, owner, chair and chief executive of home-grown auction house Artcurial. His business posted a record year of sales and he acknowledges the Brexit effect: “Paris has been a little more in the spotlight these past few years, which has helped everyone here.”</p> <p>The year ahead brings launches in Singapore — Art SG arrives in January — and in Japan, where Tokyo Gendai opens in the summer. Both come courtesy of the Art Assembly, a loose tie-up of three longtime art-fair organisers who know how to navigate the risks of opening large events around the world. The outstanding questions for 2023 surround the sustainability of these proliferating fairs for a tired planet. “Environmental sustainability is an issue we take very seriously,” says Magnus Renfrew, global director of the Art Assembly. His new fairs start on the right track. “We have moved entirely to LED lighting and now use appropriate offsets for our staff travel as standard. We are continually working with our suppliers, contractors, vendors and venues for whom this is also a priority.”</p> <p>In China, where demand for art has helped power the market in recent years, the country's zero-Covid policy hampered activity in 2022 — two fairs were shut down midway on the back of one confirmed case in November. China's imposition of its political might continues to dog Hong Kong as a trading centre, but art businesses are still placing longer-term bets here. In the spring, Phillips will expand into a 50,000 sq ft headquarters in the West Kowloon Cultural District, close to the M+ museum that finally opened in 2021, while Sotheby's will open a 24,000 sq ft building in the Central district in 2024. Now that Covid restrictions have eased considerably in the territory, the hope is Art Basel Hong Kong can have a relatively normal outing for the first time in four years come March.</p> <p>There is still all to play for in the region, says Elaine Kwok, managing partner of Hauser &amp; Wirth in Asia. “People came to Hong Kong even during lockdowns. Now it is better than ever. The M+ museum looks amazing, the energy is great and the international world is coming, including from China,” she says.</p> <p>Overall, collector tastes have shifted slightly towards abstract art rather than the previously dominant figurative works, an age-old cycle. At the higher end of the price scale, purchases seem to have narrowed even more towards tried-and-tested artists, while at the speculative end, the money is sticking with artists represented by well-known galleries. Moves into works by black painters and older, rediscovered female artists continued but were less marked this year as traditional collections took the limelight. The latest Burns Halperin report, which tracks equity and representation in the art world, found black American artists' year-on-year share of the market fell from an already paltry 4 per cent in 2021 to 3 per cent halfway through 2022.</p> <p>Last year's craze for art backed by non-fungible tokens all but disappeared this year, as the crypto industry crumbled, with bitcoin down more than 60 per cent (at time of writing). Yet despite the cold winds, art businesses continue to explore the potential of blockchain to overcome some of the market's many inefficiencies.</p> <p>Decorative arts, including furniture and textiles, proved this year's money-spinners, boosted by brand-name collections, including Givenchy's and that of Qatar's Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani, whose thousand-plus items sold from the Hôtel Lambert in Paris through Sotheby's for €76.6mn in October.</p> <p>At the end of this year, though, there's a sense that the art market is finally feeling the pinch. As the word “recession” punctuates conversations, even the rich might stop getting richer. “The truth is,” says private dealer Ward, “none of our buyers really need another artwork. It's our job to sell more than its commercial value.”</p> <p>Christie's Cerutti says: “We need to be realistic about the world situation and the consequences on the art market.” But he takes confidence from the performance of sales in an increasingly challenging year. He recognises that the Allen sale was a flattering outlier, but notes it was part of a wider trend over the past five years. “There was a generation of people, mostly in the US, who built their collections from the 1960s, and these will continue [to come on to the market] in the next few years.” Things might be a bit more subdued, but the art market, it seems, will motor on.</p><p>Source: Melanie Gerlis 2022 'Private collections power a year to remember in the art market' FT.com 29 December.
