  "text": "<p><strong>See you next week: </strong>on Thursday we will host the first <a href=\"https://businessofsport.live.ft.com/\">FT Business of Sports Summit</a>, which will be broadcast virtually and will close with an in-person dinner in Manhattan on October 14.

That's one of the main lessons of covering business and finance in this country. </p> <p>One specific transaction, however, appeared (for a moment) to be the exception to that rule: the £300m takeover of <strong>Newcastle United Football Club</strong> by <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong>'s sovereign wealth fund.</p> <p>“It turns out there are some things money can't buy, even for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,” declared the opening line of DD in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9893c28b-2ba6-4f8c-9385-f548768fdf64\">July last year.</a> The kingdom's poor human rights record, including the 2018 murder of the journalist <strong>Jamal Khashoggi </strong>by Saudi agents, coupled with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a2eb20a-e7d7-4da5-b5ec-95be5e2aefe3\">piracy claims</a> brought by Qatar, had put up too solid a defence. &#xa0;</p> <p>Until they didn't. The deal, which had died in the summer of 2020, was resurrected in the form of a £305m acquisition <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d93463e6-a6e0-400a-bec0-25d7c420b9f1\">announced on Thursday</a> in a victory for <strong>Prince Mohammed bin Salman</strong>.</p> <p>So what changed?</p> <p>When Saudi Arabia dropped its months-long pursuit of the <strong>English Premier League </strong>club last year, it wasn't because they had failed to agree a deal with Newcastle's owner, the billionaire retail tycoon <strong>Mike Ashley</strong>.</p> <p>Ashley has been desperate to offload the club, having been the subject of wrath by Newcastle supporters who say the <strong>Sports Direct</strong> founder's lack of investment in players is to blame for their club's struggles.</p> <p>The reasons for the deal's initial failure, while never publicly discussed, are twofold: first, the aforementioned <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bfcd005c-4506-432c-8535-57402407b486\">piracy dispute</a> between Saudi Arabia and Qatar over the broadcasting of Premier League matches in the Middle East; and second, the fact that a sovereign nation isn't supposed to own a football club. </p> <p>Since then, regional tensions between Saudi Arabia and Qatar have eased with the two nations <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2df109f9-8ca3-460e-aea1-2a125557af89\">settling the piracy dispute</a> just this week.</p> <p>And separately, the Premier League has become comfortable with “legally binding assurances” that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia wouldn't exercise control over Newcastle. How that's supposed to work isn't entirely clear . . . the FT's Murad Ahmed has the Premier League's official statement <a href=\"https://twitter.com/muradahmed/status/1446148097206325249\">here</a>:</p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/muradahmed/status/1446164899672043529\">https://twitter.com/muradahmed/status/1446164899672043529 </a> <p>Saudi Arabia's promise to keep politics off the pitch is hard to believe given that the majority of funding for the deal is coming from its <strong>Public Investment Fund</strong>. The PIF's head <strong>Yasir al-Rumayyan</strong>, one of Prince Mohammed's closest lieutenants, will become the club's non-executive chair.</p> <p>Despite the uncertainty lingering over the new arrangement, the deal marks a big win for the British financier <strong>Amanda Staveley</strong>, who has spent years trying to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b2f0d24-e2fe-4d04-bd33-54bcebfbd42b\">woo the crown prince</a> into buying Newcastle.</p> <p>Best known for orchestrating the purchase of <strong>Manchester City</strong> by the Abu Dhabi royal <strong>Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan</strong> in 2008, Staveley's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b2f0d24-e2fe-4d04-bd33-54bcebfbd42b\">“anti-Wall Street playbook”</a> has proved successful once again.</p> <p>She joins the club's board alongside the real estate mogul <strong>Jamie Reuben</strong>, one-half of the billionaire Reuben brothers, both of whom are included in the new ownership group. </p> <p>And, lest we forget the deal's other winners: Newcastle's fans, or the Magpies as they're known, who will take pretty much anyone over Ashley. </p> <p>They are undoubtedly cracking open the #cans — Newcastle supporters' celebratory hashtag of choice.</p> <p>We'll have more analysis on the deal in tomorrow's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/scoreboard\">Scoreboard</a> newsletter, so make sure to <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/pages/newsletters/5e5e3d297600b40004c209fc/subscribe/success\">sign up here</a> if you

Treasury in 2006, he brought so many of his former co-workers to Washington that bankers began throwing around the phrase “Government Sachs”.&#xa0;</p> <p>But if Goldman has infiltrated the upper echelons of American politics, then<strong> BlackRock </strong>— the largest money manager the world has ever seen — has occupied an even higher plane.</p> <p>“I didn't know <strong>Larry Fink</strong> had been made God,” the billionaire property investor <strong>Sam Zell </strong>said of BlackRock's chief in an interview with the business news channel CNBC in 2018. “I just wonder whether America is really ready for<strong> Vanguard</strong> and BlackRock to control the<strong> New York Stock Exchange</strong>, because that's what's happening,” he added.</p> <p>Almost four years later, as an extraordinary $9.5tn courses through the mega-manager on behalf of everyone from pensioners to oligarchs to sovereign wealth funds, the question remains: does BlackRock have too much money?</p> <p>The FT's Robin Wigglesworth <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7dfd1e3d-e256-4656-a96d-1204538d75cd\">looks at</a> how BlackRock and Fink have managed to amass so much power over the years in this adapted excerpt from his upcoming book.</p> <p>A major turning point came following the financial crisis, when the hard-charging — and by some accounts — somewhat disagreeable master negotiator <strong>Rob Kapito </strong>persuaded <strong>Barclays</strong>' chief <strong>Bob Diamond</strong> to sell its asset management arm to BlackRock.</p> <p>The British bank was reeling from an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/business/worldbusiness/18barclays.html\">ill-advised deal</a> to buy <strong>Lehman Brothers</strong>' US business after its implosion, and needed cash fast to avoid a UK government bailout. </p> <p>The deal cemented Kapito as Fink's right-hand man, and the two have gone on to build an unparalleled asset management empire, with Fink as its charismatic head and Kapito behind the scenes.</p> <p>Along the way, Fink has steered BlackRock's reputation as a good guy on Wall Street, embracing the industry trend of environmental, social and governance, or ESG, investing — rhetoric that <strong>Tariq Fancy</strong>, a former BlackRock sustainability executive, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@sosofancy/the-secret-diary-of-a-sustainable-investor-part-1-70b6987fa139\">recently criticised</a> as “marketing gobbledegook”.</p> <p>BlackRock's profit margins outweigh that of <strong>Apple</strong> or <strong>Google</strong>, and its $126bn market capitalisation is greater than the values of its rivals <strong>TRowe Price</strong>, <strong>Franklin Templeton, Invesco</strong>, <strong>Janus Henderson</strong>, <strong>Schroders </strong>and <strong>State Street</strong> combined.</p> <p>Fink told the FT that he would consider breaking BlackRock into smaller legal entities if a consensus were to be reached that its size is chipping away at corporate governance. “If society believes this is going to be a big issue, it is solvable,” he said.</p> <p>As the company's influence only continues to grow, bringing bipartisan ire in its wake, it's unclear how much longer Fink can evade the type of resolution he's referring to.</p> <h2>The Indian hotel platform trying not to become the next WeWork</h2> <p><strong>Ritesh Agarwal</strong>, a charismatic 27-year-old Indian entrepreneur, was able to convince <strong>SoftBank</strong>'s <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong> to back his ambitions. Now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cde704da-cd8a-11e9-99a4-b5ded7a7fe3f\">he needs to win over</a> a more sceptical Indian public.</p> <p>Agarwal's hotel platform<strong> Oyo</strong>, whose high-profile wobbles have made it one of the most closely watched Indian start-ups, filed its draft prospectus ahead of a listing in Mumbai. &#xa0;</p> <p>It hopes to raise Rs70bn ($944m) through fresh shares and sell another Rs14.3bn in existing shares, the majority of which will come from SoftBank as the Japanese conglomerate prepares to trim its 47 per cent stake.</p> <p>Oyo was hurtling towards becoming the world's largest hotel chain, expanding into dozens of countries by signing independent budget hotels to its platform. Yet mounting losses and a hotelier backlash prompted comparisons to fellow SoftBank-funded start-up <strong>WeWork</strong>.</p> <p>The company has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/056a1077-8503-4e72-a2f4-33172dd2fb03\">reduced its ambitions</a> to a handful of markets including India and south-east Asia, betting on robust demand for local leisure and business travel in the coming years. It has cut its losses to Rs39bn in the year ending in March from Rs128bn a year earlier.</p> <p>Its private investors no longer appear willing to fund its losses. Oyo recently raised $5m from <strong>Microsoft</strong>, compared with a mega $2bn in 2019 in which Agarwal borrowed from Japanese banks in order to buy back shares.</p> <p>Oyo's timing looks impeccable. Buoyant equity markets have encouraged a flurry of start-ups to plan initial public offerings.<strong> Zomato</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55f803f6-0c6e-4dba-afeb-d45d4307e013\">listing</a>, the first among them, was well received and its shares remain almost double their listing price.</p> <p>Conservative Indian public market investors have often balked at lossmaking businesses. Luckily for Oyo, that appears to be changing.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>KKR</strong> has appointed <strong>Evan Spiegel</strong>, the co-founder and chief executive of <strong>Snap</strong>, to its board of directors.</p></li>  <li><p>Saudi Arabia's <strong>PIF</strong> has hired former <strong>Mercer Investments</strong> senior adviser <strong>Tony Hage</strong> as its head of international private equity, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-06/saudi-wealth-fund-hires-hage-as-head-of-global-private-equity?srnd=economics-vp&amp;sref=fLR6XBbO\">per Bloomberg</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Blackstone </strong>has recruited <strong>Amisha Parekh </strong>as a managing director and global head of ESG for private equity. She joins from <strong>Bloomberg</strong>, where she led ESG data acquisition and curation efforts.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> has appointed <strong>Abid Chaudhri</strong>, who joins from<strong> BNP Paribas</strong>, and <strong>Ed McBride</strong>, who joins from <strong>Citi</strong>, as managing directors in its UK investment banking unit.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>@handlerrich on Wall Street </strong>Jefferies boss and newly minted billionaire Rich Handler is having his best year yet helping clients cash in on risky deals between Instagram posts.
