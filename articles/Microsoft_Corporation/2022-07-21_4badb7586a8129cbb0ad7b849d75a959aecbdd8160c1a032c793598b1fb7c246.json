  "title": "What Are Carbon Offsets, and Can They Combat Climate Change? Some scientists say evidence is lacking for offsets' purported effects on carbon emissions",
  "text": "<p>In early 2021, Microsoft Corp. paid a forest-products company to ensure that a large stand of trees in southern Oregonwould be protected for at least a century. Like many other large companies whose business activities emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, Microsoft was buying carbon offsets to cancel out some of its greenhouse-gas emissions.</p><p>But when the Bootleg Fire swept through the area five months later, many of the trees in the forest—and the carbon sequestered in their limbs, trunks and roots—went up in smoke. When they did, of course, so did the environmental benefit of the offsets.</p><p>That unforeseen conflagration is one example of how offsets don't always deliver on the claims made for them, according to scientists who have studied them.</p><p>\"There's a lot of pressure at the corporate and the individual level to take action on climate change,\" said Danny Cullenward, policy director of CarbonPlan, a San Francisco-based carbon-accounting nonprofit. \"The problem is the market isn't working, and people are talking about it instead and relying on it instead of taking the actions that they need to take.\"</p><p>Here's what science has to say about carbon offsets:</p><p>What are carbon offsets?</p><p>Carbon offsets are financial credits designed to shrink a company's or individual's carbon footprint by funding environmental projects that help curb emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. If a firm pays for projects to protect forests or develop wind farms, for example, those projects can in theory make up for the firm's own carbon emissions. Individuals sometimes buy carbon offsets to balance carbon emissions from airline flights they take or car trips they make.</p><p>In 2021, more than 1.5 billion metric tons of carbon-offset credits were issued for more than 5,000 offset projects that promised to reduce or capture carbon emissions, according to a 2022 report by Carbon Direct, a New York City-based consulting firm. The carbon-offset market surpassed $1 billion in 2021, according to Washington, D.C.,-based data provider Ecosystem Marketplace.</p><p>The marketplace in which credits are bought and sold is verified by third-party firms but is currently unregulated by any federal agency.</p><p>What kinds of offsets are most popular?</p><p>Forest-preservation offsets are popular, as are offsets that fund projects involving solar and wind power and farming practices aimed at keeping carbon out of the atmosphere. There are also ocean-based \"blue\" offsets that promise to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by farming seaweed and then allowing the harvest to sink.</p><p>Some offsets invest in small-scale community projects to lower the carbon footprint of cookstoves in developing nations, which then generate a carbon credit. Other offset projects generate credits by generating electricity from greenhouse gases released from landfills.</p><p>How long have carbon offsets been around?</p><p>The first carbon-offset project began in 1989, when Applied Energy Services, now a global energy firm known as AES and based in Arlington, Va., offset carbon-dioxide emissions expected from a coal-fired power plant it was building in Connecticut. It did so by spending $2 million to fund a forest conservation and replanting project in Guatemala, according to a 2009 study by Canadian and Sri Lankan researchers.</p><p>By 1999, the study showed, the project had captured 270,000 metric tons of carbon—far less than the 15.5 million to 16.3 million metric tons that had been expected.</p><p>Are carbon offsets having a positive impact on climate change?</p><p>Researchers who study offsets said it is hard to tell if they are making a difference in global carbon emissions. One challenge is determining whether the carbon-sequestering initiatives resulting from the sale of offsets—such as building a solar farm or protecting a forest from logging—might have been undertaken even in the absence of the offsets.</p><p>\"With any project, we really need to make sure that its impacts are additional,\" said Christopher Williams, director of the biogeosciences research group and a professor of geography at Clark University. \"If we cannot establish that, then we really don't have a reliable carbon offset.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think is the future of carbon offsets? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In addition to this \"additionality\" problem, there is the concern that landowners and other entities that sell offsets will undermine the offsets' goals by shifting their activities elsewhere—for example, preserving one tract of timberland while cutting down trees in another. Experts call this phenomenon \"leakage.\"</p><p>Another concern is that the original terms of an offset agreement can be nullified if a landowner sells its property, for example, or if an offsets-related project fails—a potential problem experts call \"permanence.\"</p><p>The International Energy Agency reported in March that global greenhouse-gas emissions from energy and industry in 2021 rose to a record 36.3 gigatons. In the U.S., emissions have slowed 17 percent since 2005, mainly because of the switch from coal- to natural-gas-fired power plants, according to the Rhodium Group, a consulting firm in New York City.</p><p>The offsets being bought by airlines, oil companies, hotel chains and others have been blamed for delaying the implementation of reliable business and technology strategies to reduce energy use and carbon emissions.</p><p>Carbon offsets \"are one of the tools in the toolbox,\" said Karen Holl, professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. \"But the first one has to be reducing emissions radically.\"</p><p>Are there any clear benefits?</p><p>The trade in carbon credits has spurred the development of environmentally friendly projects and pushed carbon emitters to consider ways they can curb the release of greenhouse gases, according to experts in the field. Carbon-offset programs may help protect some tropical forests.</p><p>\"I don't know whether they're really offsetting carbon dioxide that we are emitting,\" Mukund Palat Rao, a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said of carbon offsets. \"But by conserving a plot of land and stopping it from being deforested, we are stopping the carbon that the forest has accumulated over the past 200 years from going back into the atmosphere.\"</p><p>How permanent are offsets?</p><p>Not very. In addition to burning, ostensibly protected forests can be devastated by insect pests—and both problems are worsening as the climate warms, according to the U.S. Forest Service</p><p>If a farmer generates carbon credits by modifying his farming practices and then leaves the property to a child who then sells to a housing developer before the credit term expires, the environmental benefit of the carbon offset disappears—even though the purchaser of the credit can still use it.</p><p>Who checks on carbon offsets?</p><p>Four major offset nonprofit organizations maintain registries that set rules for how offset projects will work. Project developers—a landowner or solar farm developer, for example—then hire outside consultants to ensure their projects comply with registry rules. Once the registry verifies that the project adheres to the rules, it issues the carbon-offset credits to the offset purchaser.</p><p>Given such concerns, are offsets becoming less popular?</p><p>Not likely, according to scientists and policy experts who study the offset marketplace. Many companies are being pressured by customers and shareholders to reduce their carbon footprints. This continues to drive the market for offsets, according to Bruce Usher, professor of professional practice at Columbia Business School.</p><p>\"Companies are pledging to reduce their emissions to zero, and yet it's virtually impossible to run any business anywhere in the world with zero emissions,\" Mr. Usher said. \"There are just certain things that you simply can't eliminate altogether. And so your only solution at the end of the day, is to use offsets.\"</p><p>Write to Eric Niiler at eric.niiler@wsj.com</p><p>What Are Carbon Offsets, and Can They Combat Climate Change?</p>",
