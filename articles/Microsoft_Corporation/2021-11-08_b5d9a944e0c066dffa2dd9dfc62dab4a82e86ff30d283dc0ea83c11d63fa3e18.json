  "text": "<p>As far as visions of the metaverse go, exploring a digital world populated by fluffy animals and colourful flowers is more exciting than sitting round a conference table in a virtual meeting room.</p> <p>Niantic, the augmented reality (AR) company behind popular mobile game <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/e79606fe-99f6-4280-960f-a46d1b80f0df\"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a>, has entered the race to shape the metaverse, giving external game developers access to its technology to create their own applications for the first time.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46d00829-04bc-4136-992e-856975bbccca\">Both Facebook and Microsoft</a> have showcased ambitions to create the metaverse — digital worlds where people play as avatars in virtual or augmented reality at home. Niantic is pushing for a ‘real-world metaverse' that incentivises people to explore the outdoors instead.</p> <p>Some of Lightship's first partners include music festival Coachella and the Historic Royal Parks, where users will be able to plant AR flowers in a moat around the Tower of London next year.</p> <p>“This assumption that all of our futures are going to be like <em>The Matrix</em>, that we're going to be plugged into some alternate reality, would be a nightmare,” said John Hanke, Niantic's chief executive and founder.</p> <p>Lots of apps in the market try to promote harmful activity such as excessive use, or create divisions in communities, Hanke said. “I think inclusivity and getting a breadth of people making and creating in this space upfront, is really important.”</p> <p>Access to Niantic's technology platform, called Lightship Augmented Reality Developer Kit, will be free to apps with under 50,000 monthly active users. Any exceeding that threshold will be charged $5 per 10,000 users.</p> <p>Developers will soon be able to access Niantic's “treasure chest of technology and data”, including mapping technology that pinpoints real-world locations to digital hotspots in AR. The company has already mapped out vast chunks of the world by collecting data from millions of players.</p> <p>Niantic has also launched a $20m fund called Niantic Ventures to invest in companies registered on Lightship.</p> <p>Hanke said that revenue from <em>Pikmin Bloom</em>, a game launched with Nintendo two weeks ago, and established games like <em>Pokémon Go</em>, will mean it can avoid relying on venture capital investment for its new platform.</p> <p><em>Pokémon Go</em> has remained popular, entering its fourth year of growth of over $1m in revenue. Data from app research firm Sensor Tower estimates it has generated more than $5.5bn from player spending since its launch in 2016.</p> <p>But last week, Niantic also announced that it would be shutting down <em>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</em>, a game that by comparison has flopped. In the two years since its launch, the game has amassed 20.3m downloads worldwide and made $39.4m from player spending, according to Sensor Tower. </p> <p>Hanke said it was winding down the game in January because of poor audience growth and dated technology.</p> <p>“There has long been this question of what the next <em>Pokémon Go</em> will be, or what could take its crown in AR mobile gaming,” said Louise Shorthouse, senior games analyst at Ampere Analysis. “Hopes were certainly high for <em>Wizards Unite</em>, but it was poorly received from the start due to the perceived complexity of the game, over-monetisation, and difficulties in acquiring enough energy to actually play.”</p><p>Source: Cristina Criddle 2021 'Niantic opens up the race to create the next Pokémon Go' FT.com 8 November.
