  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- The State Department plans organizational changes to confront international-cybersecurity challenges such as ransomware and waning global digital freedom, U.S. officials said, the latest overhaul by the Biden administration aimed at treating cyber threats as a top-tier national-security issue. </p><p>   The restructuring will include the creation of a new bureau of cyberspace and digital policy to be led by a Senate-confirmed ambassador-at-large and a new, separate special envoy for critical and emerging technology, officials said. Both positions will report directly to Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman for at least the first year, the officials said. The administration hasn't decided who will fill either role. </p><p>   The changes, expected to be announced by Secretary of State Antony Blinken later this week, are the latest in a series of reshufflings at the State Department over at least the past three presidential administrations designed to better respond to proliferating and evolving international cybersecurity problems, such as state-sponsored intrusions of U.S. government networks, theft of intellectual property by Chinese citizens, and interference in U.S. elections from Russia and elsewhere. </p><p>   The new structure is meant to reflect Mr. Blinken's view that the U.S. has entered a \"fundamentally new era in global affairs\" where 21st-century challenges like climate change and emerging technology are at the forefront of international cooperation and competition with allies and adversaries alike, a senior State Department official said. </p><p>   Recent ransomware attacks linked to Russian criminal gangs have driven home the challenges of international diplomacy around cyber issues. The Biden administration has sought to engage in bilateral talks with Moscow on ransomware and other issues, but both Russian criminal groups and the Kremlin have largely continued their routine hacking activities, according to officials and private-sector cybersecurity experts. On Monday, Microsoft said the Russian government hackers behind last year's SolarWinds attack had in recent months targeted and in some cases broken into cloud service providers to steal sensitive information. </p><p>   Officials recognized there had been previous struggles to address cybersecurity and technology issues at the State Department and that the new structure would also be an adjustment. </p><p>   The State Department is completing details of the cyberspace and digital policy bureau's size and budget with lawmakers, officials said. </p><p>   The moves are the latest by the Biden administration seeking to emphasize cybersecurity as a distinct issue that poses vital risks to the future of U.S. national and economic security. </p><p>   The new cyber bureau will comprise a division focused on international cybersecurity issues, such as deterrence, policy development, and negotiations with allies and adversaries alike. A second division will be dedicated to digital policy, such as promoting trusted telecom systems abroad. A third will focus on digital freedom, such as protecting human rights online and working with civil society. </p><p></p>",
