  "text": "<p>   Amazon executives dread emails from Mr. Bezos with a question mark, but Mr. Jassy's most common response to emails is \"Nice!\" He's become so known for the response that some AWS employees made stickers with the CEO's face on them with a conversation bubble from his mouth saying \"Nice!\" </p><p>   One AWS executive recalls an all-hands meeting where Mr. Jassy said: \"We're not put on earth to work\" with the executive stressing family balance. Mr. Bezos in the past has dismissed the concept of work-life balance, saying he preferred the concept of \"work-life harmony.\" </p><p>   Still, Mr. Jassy is demanding. At the weekly \"wheel\" meetings, Mr. Jassy and his deputies would ask pointed, in-depth questions of whichever manager or team member was picked -- they initially used a handmade spinner like those used in board games or game shows, but later adopted a computer algorithm when there were too many divisions to include. Some employees called it \"the firing squad,\" and some called it \"the wheel of death.\" An Amazon spokesman said these phrases are not common descriptions for the meeting. </p><p>   When Mr. Jassy is displeased with an employee, he can leave very pointed feedback, though he'll often follow up with a conciliatory email later, one of the people said. Mr. Jassy doesn't yell in meetings, but can get very pointed in his critiques, especially if he feels someone is not taking a problem seriously enough. \"The guy has a sense of urgency that I've never seen in my life,\" said a former executive. </p><p>   The wheel meeting is emblematic of Mr. Jassy's view that you can't rely on people's good intentions -- you need a forcing function to make them live up to company expectations, according to people familiar with Mr. Jassy. If the wheel wasn't in place, some people wouldn't come prepared. \"He wanted everyone in the room to be able to dive into the minutiae of the service,\" said one current AWS executive. </p><p>   Big defections have angered him, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has initiated noncompete lawsuits against former top employees he was very friendly with, some of the people said. \"A perfect example of him using up a massive amount of effort and a lot of people to optimize something that isn't very important,\" said a former executive about one case where the company sued a former employee who left for Google. An Amazon spokesman said employee departures haven't angered Mr. Jassy. </p><p>   Mr. Jassy himself was once considered for the CEO position at Microsoft Corp., according to people familiar with the matter. That job went to Satya Nadella in 2014. </p><p>   Not long after, in 2016, Mr. Bezos named two of his top lieutenants CEOs of Amazon's major businesses. Mr. Jassy was named CEO of AWS. Jeff Wilke was named CEO of Amazon's expansive retail business. Earlier this year he left Amazon. AWS has nearly quadrupled its revenue in the years since. </p><p>   Overseeing the parts of the business he hasn't run will be an adjustment for Mr. Jassy. AWS's business focuses almost entirely on corporate customers, while Amazon's retail and entertainment operations have hundreds of millions of individual users. But Mr. Jassy's role on the S-team, the name given to the group of around 20 top executives under Mr. Bezos, has given him exposure to issues across the company. Mr. Hamilton, the AWS executive, said that despite Mr. Jassy's love of detail, he's good at delegating. </p><p>   \"AWS has grown to be an incredibly large, big business right now, and Andy has easily scaled to keep up with that,\" he said. </p><p>   Some Amazon investors say while they have high confidence in Mr. Jassy's ability to steer Amazon successfully, the new CEO faces heightened scrutiny compared with running AWS. </p><p>   \"It's like being a fighter pilot and having a lot of experience in the simulator, but regardless, when you go up there and get in your first dogfight, it's different,\" said Trip Miller, managing partner of Gullane Capital Partners LLC, which he said owns more than $37 million in Amazon stock. \"You're the commander of the plane.\" </p><p>   Mr. Bezos, who will remain executive chairman, has emphasized continuity in handing the CEO reins to Mr. Jassy. The founder, who chose July 5 as the handover date because it's the 27th anniversary of the date Amazon was incorporated, has already in recent years delegated much of the day-to-day running of the company to Mr. Jassy and other senior lieutenants, the Journal has reported. This month, Mr. Bezos plans to travel to space with his brother as part of the first crew carried by his rocket company, Blue Origin. </p><p>   At Amazon's annual shareholder meeting in May, Mr. Bezos said his successor \"has the energy needed to keep alive in us what has made us special.\" Mr. Jassy \"has my full confidence,\" Mr. Bezos said. \"He has the highest of high standards, that I guarantee that Andy will never let the universe make us typical.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Sebastian Herrera contributed to this article. </p><p>   (See related articles: \"Where the Amazon Chief Goes From Here --- A post-CEO checklist: head to space, fight climate change, finish superyacht\"; \"Heard on the Street: A New Day Will Bring New Challenges --- Taking over a company that's already in orbit is a unique headache\" -- WSJ July 3, 2021) </p><p></p>",
