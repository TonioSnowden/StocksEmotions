  "text": "<p>In the rich yet judicious \"How the Victorians Took Us to the Moon: The Story of the 19th-Century Innovators Who Forged Our Future,\" Iwan Rhys Morus presents a perfectly protopian history. He begins by showing how nearly all the scientific and technological advances we think of as having emerged ex nihilo in the late 20th century in fact had their origin in the 19th century. Mr. Morus, whose previous books include \"The Oxford Illustrated History of Science,\" writes: \"The Victorian future was built around progress. Their world was not static any longer; their universe was in a constant state of evolution.\" This worldview, moreover, extended beyond science and technology. \"Just as nature evolved, Victorians thought that society should evolve as well.\"</p><p>The discovery of the second law of thermodynamics, for example, demonstrated that without an outside source of energy like the sun, warm things turn cold, systems run down and societies fall apart. Progress requires human intervention. For the Victorian transformationists, who found a kindred spirit in Darwin, \"it was not just planets that had emerged from cosmic dust, but life as well, slowly working its way up the ladder of complexity towards humankind,\" Mr. Morus writes. \"Radical social thinkers clung to ideas like these as evidence that change needed to happen in society too—that progress was part of the proper order of things.\"</p><p>The implication was that innovation and technology were required to bring about social progress. Enter the telegraph, radio, steam-driven vehicles, flying machines and even electric vehicles fueled by nature-powered electrical stations. \"Popular and technical journals were full of plans to build electric boats and electric locomotives,\" Mr. Morus tells us. \"Experts argued over whether electricity would become more economic than steam power. The future pictured in scientific romances was overwhelmingly electrical, with electricity generated in limitless amounts from wind, sun or water.\" Nikola Tesla envisioned a future of wireless electricity everywhere, too cheap to meter.</p><p>Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone in 1876 was especially fecund, generating endless ideas for spinoff technologies such as telectroscopes—electrical devices for visual communication over long distances: think Facetime, Skype or Zoom. Telectroscopes, along with wireless telegraphy, were also employed in science-fiction stories to imagine communicating with people inhabiting other worlds.</p><p>But just as \"we make our futures out of bits and pieces of our present,\" so, too, did the Victorians—who, Mr. Morus notes, pioneered another innovation still in use today: \"They shared a common cause in making their expertise count in the corridors of political power so that they could actively engage in future-making.\" Mechanical calculators such as Charles Babbage's analytical engine, for instance, were envisioned to be vital instruments of an ever-growing imperial bureaucracy. An editorial cartoon in the magazine Punch shows a pair of successful parents chatting via telectroscope with their children—in far-off British colonies. Mr. Morus reminds us that one vision for the instant communication that electricity provided was \"new ways of keeping the Empire together—giving the centre of imperial power tools that would prove vital for keeping the peripheries under control . . . an all-seeing eye for the state.\"</p><p>The Victorian heroes of Mr. Morus's book are overwhelmingly middle class and, predictably for the era, male. Imposing order on nature's entropy required discipline, and to the Victorians \"the possession of disciplined minds was what was supposed to be the difference between men and women. Men could be trusted to keep themselves under control while women were at the mercy of their uncontrollable bodies.\" Mr. Morus cites as an example of this mindset Samuel Smiles's wildly popular 1859 work \"Self-Help,\" in which women are conspicuous by their absence. \"As far as Smiles, his readers and the men they were urged to emulate were concerned,\" Mr. Morus writes, \"individual self-improvement was an entirely masculine affair. The notion that a woman might be a role model, or even a potential reader, would have simply been inconceivable. Men of science were clear that their science was a man's domain. It required a cast of character that was distinctively masculine.\"</p><p>It is natural for all generations to think they live in special times. And maybe they do. But as we look back at how we arrived at the 21st century, Mr. Morus's argument that it was the Victorians, more than any other cluster of precursors, who got us here, is a case well made. Imagine the advances still to come, then—both technological and moral—as Victorian prejudices and the barriers to participation in progress are eliminated.</p><p>Mr. Shermer is the publisher of Skeptic magazine, host of \"The Michael Shermer Show\" and a presidential fellow at Chapman University. His latest book is \"Conspiracy: Why the Rational Believe the Irrational.\"</p><p>'How the Victorians Took Us to the Moon' Review: Partial Progress</p>",
