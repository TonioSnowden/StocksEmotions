  "title": "These 10 Dividend Aristocrat stocks have made investors a lot of money — which might soar from here? Companies that are in the habit of raising their regular dividends every year often are good choices for long-term growth",
  "text": "<p>True, this strategy wasn't working out so well for several years of the bull market that lasted through 2021. But everything seems different now that interest rates are higher and the world economy in flux.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index XX:SP50DIV is made up of 63 companies in the S&amp;P 500 SPX that have raised their regular dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. It makes no difference how high the current dividend yield is. The index is equally weighed and rebalanced quarterly. The current dividend yields for the index components range from 0.23% to 4.95%.</p><p>Read: Dividend stocks are a top inflation-fighting investment you want in your corner now</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index is tracked by the ProShares S&amp;P Dividend Aristocrats ETF NOBL. As this chart shows, its performance, with dividends reinvested, lagged that of the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF SPY, for the five years through 2021:</p><p>This year, both ETFs have declined, but the Dividend Aristocrats ETF has fallen less:</p><p>Exchange-traded funds offer diversification</p><p>One obvious way to invest in the Dividend Aristocrats as a group is to buy shares of NOBL. With its equal weighting, this actually diversifies a stock portfolio. After all the S&amp;P 500 is weighted by market capitalization, which means that Apple Inc. AAPL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG and Tesla Inc. TSLA together make up 21% of SPY's portfolio.</p><p>You can even diversify further, with two more groups of Aristocrats tracked by S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices:</p><p>* The S&amp;P 400 Dividend Aristocrats Index has 48 stocks of companies that have raised dividends for at least 15 consecutive years, drawn from the full S&amp;P Mid Cap 400 Index MID. It is tracked by the ProShares S&amp;P MidCap 400 Dividend Aristocrats ETF REGL.</p><p>* The S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index XX:SPHYDA is made up of the 119 stocks in the S&amp;P Composite 1500 Index XX:SP1500 that have increased dividends for at least 20 straight years. It is tracked by the SPDR S&amp;P Dividend ETF SDY . The S&amp;P Composite 1500 itself is made up of the S&amp;P 500, the S&amp;P Mid Cap 400 and the S&amp;P 600 Small Cap Index SML. So the S&amp;P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index includes all the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. But it excludes some that are in the S&amp;P 400 Dividend Aristocrats Index. The name of the High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index is confusing, because the yields aren't necessarily high — they range from 0.23% to 5.00%.</p><p>Don't fall for Dividend Aristocrats with the highest current yields</p><p>For those looking to pick among the Dividend Aristocrats, one option is to focus on those with the highest current dividend yields, especially if you are looking for income right now.</p><p>Those current yields are attractive when compared with 10-year U.S. Treasury notes BX:TMUBMUSD10Y that yield less than 3%.</p><p>If we combine the three groups of Dividend Aristocrats and remove duplicates, we have a list of 136 companies. Here are the 10 with the highest current dividend yields: </p><p> Company                                 Ticker   Current dividend yield   Total Return – 5 Years  Mercury General Corp.
