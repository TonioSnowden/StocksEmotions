  "title": "Technology:  Zoom Sets  Stock Sale  To Raise  $1.5 Billion  ----  By Dave Sebastian",
  "text": "<p>    Zoom Video Communications Inc. plans to raise $1.5 billion through what would be its largest stock offering since its trading debut in 2019. </p><p>   The San Jose, Calif., company, whose videoconferencing platform has become a pandemic essential, on Tuesday also said it expects to grant its underwriter a 30-day option to buy up to an additional $225 million of Class A shares at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions. </p><p>   Founded in 2011, Zoom raised $447.9 million in net proceeds through its initial public offering, according to one of its quarterly filings in 2019. </p><p>   Shares of Zoom jumped 5.7% to $356.81 on Tuesday and have surged over the past year as homebound workers and students have been using the company's services during the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>   Zoom's global boost in popularity has put it at the center of a rivalry among larger technology companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Facebook Inc. that are pushing their services for managing daily life during the pandemic. </p><p>   In November, Zoom posted a record $772.2 million in quarterly sales and lifted its outlook. </p><p>   Zoom has seen a large increase in its paying subscriber numbers during the pandemic.   But the company expects its free service to continue weighing on profitability, Zoom said in November. </p><p>   \"With the uncertainty of the longevity of the pandemic, it is unclear how long gross margins will be impacted as we remain committed to supporting the global community,\" the company's finance chief, Kelly Steckelberg, said. </p><p></p>",
