  "text": "<p>Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019.</p><p>The new cash could help bankroll the tremendous computing power OpenAI needs to run its various artificial intelligence products on Azure, Microsoft's cloud computing service.</p><p>The startup already uses Azure as its exclusive cloud partner and has agreed to prioritize Microsoft when bringing new technologies to market.</p><p>OpenAI earlier this year launched Dall-E 2, a project that allowed users to generate art from strings of text and showed the fast advances being made in that segment of AI technology. Last week, Microsoft announced it was integrating Dall-E 2 with various products including Microsoft Design, a new graphic design app, and the image creator for search app Bing.</p><p>Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Microsoft have each developed their own image-generating modelsâ€”but have been slower to release them to the public, in part due to ethical concerns.</p><p>A newer set of startups have moved more quickly. In August, artificial intelligence startup Stability AI released its own text-to-image generator to the public. It then raised $101 million in new funding from investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and Coatue Management.</p><p>OpenAI, led by the technology investor Sam Altman, began as a nonprofit in 2015 with $1 billion in pledges from Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and other backers.</p><p>(More to Come)</p><p>Write to Berber Jin at berber.jin@wsj.com and Miles Kruppa at miles.kruppa@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft in Advanced Talks to Increase Investment in OpenAI</p>",
