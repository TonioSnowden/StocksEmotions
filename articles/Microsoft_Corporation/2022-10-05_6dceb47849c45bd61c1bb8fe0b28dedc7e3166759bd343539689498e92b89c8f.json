  "title": "Battery Startup Form Energy  Raises $450 Million for Plant  ----  By Amrith Ramkumar",
  "text": "<p>   A startup developing iron-air batteries that could store renewable power for several days is raising $450 million from backers including steelmaker ArcelorMittal SA and TPG Inc. </p><p>   Form Energy Inc. plans to use the funds to build its first big manufacturing facility and begin selling to customers. The private funding round more than doubles the total equity Form has raised in its five-year history, company officials said. </p><p>   The fundraising adds to a string of clean-energy investments following the Inflation Reduction Act, which cemented tax credits for battery storage and renewables for a decade. </p><p>   Form is racing to address one of the biggest barriers to widespread deployment of wind and solar power: intermittency. Current lithium-ion battery technology is costly and can only store energy for hours. New approaches are needed to store and release energy during the long stretches when the wind isn't blowing and the sun isn't shining. </p><p>   Other investors in Form's funding round include the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board -- also known as CPP Investments -- Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Singapore state-owned funds GIC Pte. Ltd. and Temasek Holdings Ltd. </p><p>   Based in Somerville, Mass., Form Energy aims to slash battery prices by using huge amounts of low-cost iron pellets. The battery takes in oxygen and converts iron to rust. It then reverses the process, turning the rust back into iron and breathing out oxygen, to charge and discharge the battery. </p><p>   The company is considering possible sites for a U.S. manufacturing facility and accelerating its target start date for commercial production to late 2024. That will involve mass-producing its batteries and getting customer and regulatory approval for the technology. </p><p>   Form Energy can scale more quickly thanks to new tax credits for battery-storage projects in the Inflation Reduction Act and forecasts for faster deployment of renewables, Chief Executive Officer Mateo Jaramillo said. \"It's a rising tide across the board,\" he said. \"It makes everybody feel that much more confident.\" </p><p>   Mr. Jaramillo helped develop Tesla Inc.'s Powerwall battery-storage system and worked on some of its earliest automotive powertrains. He compared Form's coming manufacturing challenge to what the electric-vehicle maker went through ramping up production but said Form is working with partners to set realistic targets. </p><p>   Mr. Jaramillo declined to provide the company's valuation. The company could also raise debt or project financing for the manufacturing plant. </p><p></p>",
