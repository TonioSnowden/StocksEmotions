  "text": "<p>MyHeritage, a website where users can research their family trees, has announced a “deep nostalgia” feature that can turn even a single photo of a relative into a video where they can smile, nod and wink back at them.</p> <p>The feature, created with the Israeli computer vision firm D-ID, is the latest milestone for artificial intelligence-generated media, which has spread from high-end Hollywood films to casual hobbyists in just a few years. </p> <p>The technology allows MyHeritage's 60m users to map their photographs over the facial expressions of real people, in this case MyHeritage employees, to create realistic videos in which lips, eyes and faces move. </p> <p>Gilad Japhet, chief executive of MyHeritage, said the effect “lets us imagine how they might have been in reality”. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.myheritage.com/deep-nostalgia\">MyHeritage</a> also announced that it was being acquired by Californian venture firm Francisco Partners. </p> <p>“This move will enable us to reach new heights, invest more resources in creating greater value for our users and to reach a larger audience,” said Japhet.</p> <p>Gil Perry, chief executive of D-ID, said families could now “relate to their distant ancestors in ways never imagined before”. He added that resurrecting figures from the past was a growing area of interest. </p> <p>D-ID's advertising work includes animating US president Abraham Lincoln and prolific bank robber Willie Sutton. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Microsoft received in 2020 a patent for a chatbot to have virtual conversations with individuals “past or present”, although its general manager of artificial intelligence, Tim O'Brien, said last month that there were no current plans to build such a system.</p> <p>Henry Ajder, who researches synthetic media, said there remained plenty of ethical questions on resurrecting past figures, including whether the consent of the deceased was required and for what uses it might be put. </p> <p>Perry said D-ID had strict guidelines on the companies that it partners with and that its videos featured a watermark showing that they had been artificially created. </p> <p>“We see ourselves as the good guys of synthetic media, using the technology for higher purposes.”</p><p>Source: Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan in London 2021 'MyHeritage unveils AI tool that turns photos of dead relatives into videos' FT.com 25 February.
