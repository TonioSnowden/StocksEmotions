  "title": "SoftBank Profit Is Japanese Record",
  "text": "<p>The numbers were driven largely by a gain of nearly $58 billion at the $100 billion Vision Fund and its successor. A series of companies in the fund's portfolio have gone public, taking advantage of the rising stock market.</p><p>The Vision Fund's biggest win was a $24 billion investment gain from its nearly 40% stake in South Korean e-commerce company Coupang Inc., which listed in March. SoftBank also logged gains from DoorDash Inc., which had a public offering in December, and the sale last year of a controlling stake in Sprint Corp.</p><p>SoftBank tripled the amount of capital it has pledged to its second Vision Fund, to $30 billion, showing little concern about shakiness in technology shares and the broader stock market in recent days.</p><p>SoftBank's profit in the year ended March 31 -- 4.99 trillion yen, equivalent to $45.9 billion -- is the biggest validation yet of Chief Executive Masayoshi Son's decision a few years ago to shift the conglomerate's primary business to tech investment from telecommunications -- a decision viewed with skepticism for years, especially when missteps at the Vision Fund cost the company billions of dollars in 2019 and early 2020.</p><p>SoftBank's fiscal-year profit is roughly double that of Toyota Motor Corp.'s previous Japanese record, according to data from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. It puts SoftBank in a league with tech stars such as Google parent Alphabet Inc. or Microsoft Corp., whose annual profit records are in the $40 billion range.</p><p>SoftBank's outsize profits are largely due to the red-hot performance of global stock markets during the past several months. They could evaporate if shares take a dive, since the bulk of the company's investment gains are on paper. Bouncing around between profits and losses depending on the market will be the new normal, he said.</p><p>Mr. Son said at a press conference in Tokyo that he had plenty of regrets about his investments. He mentioned WeWork, a U.S. office-share company whose plummeting valuation left SoftBank with billions of dollars in losses, and Greensill Capital, a lender that filed for insolvency protection in March.</p><p>But Mr. Son said his biggest regrets are about the companies he missed investing in. \"I'm still not satisfied,\" he said.</p><p>SoftBank has spent much of the past year selling assets, buying back shares and stocking up on cash to ensure it was strong enough to ride out the pandemic. In one of its first such moves last year, the company unveiled a plan to buy back 2.5 trillion yen, the equivalent of around $23 billion, of its own shares in a little more than a year. At the time, that was equivalent to 45% of its stock. That repurchase is now complete, as is a pledge to spend another 2.5 trillion yen on retiring debt and bulking up its cash reserves, SoftBank said.</p><p>Investors have credited the buyback with helping spur the big rise in SoftBank's shares.</p>",
