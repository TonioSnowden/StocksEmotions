  "text": "<p>In any case, this may be my last week regularly handling ETF Wrap (Though, I might make an occasional guest appearance).</p><p>Please, send tips, or feedback, on Twitter to Christine Idzelis at @cidzelis and find Mark at @mdecambre&#xa0;or&#xa0;LinkedIn&#xa0;to tell us what you think.</p><p>Sign Up For ETF Wrap</p><p>Rosenbluth exits CFRA</p><p>Todd Rosenbluth has left CFRA to become director of research at ETF Trends, replacing Dave Nadig. Rosenbluth has been a vital contributor to ETF Wrap, while he served as head of mutual funds and ETFs at CFRA.</p><p>Nadig said he was “super excited” to have Rosenbluth on board.</p><p>The Fed and ETFs</p><p>On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point, as widely expected, and laid out plans for a more aggressive strategy of “ongoing increases” in the months ahead to combat high U.S. inflation.</p><p>Inflation is running at a 40-year peak, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powel has a tall task ahead of him. The Fed is shifting away from two years of easy-money policy that cushioned the economy during the pandemic.</p><p>The Fed now sees its policy rate hitting 1.9% by the end of this year, jumping to 2.8% in 2023 and staying at that level in 2024. Rates at 2.8% would start to soften economic growth, according to Fed calculations.</p><p>What does that mean for ETFs?</p><p>We've written a ton on the subject but a rising interest rate environment is one in which banks might flourish, due to their business models of borrowing short-term and lending out longer-term.</p><p>Analysts have pointed to the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund XLF and the SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF KRE and the SPDR Bank ETF KBE, as solid bets. All of those funds are up on the week thus far.</p><p>But it might be a tough slog for banks if the so-called yield curve inverts. Read more about that here.</p><p>Commodity ETFs shine</p><p>Commodity-pegged ETFs are enjoying a moment in the sun, with investment flows picking up steam, amid concerns that the Russia-Ukraine war will disrupt supplies and push prices even higher.</p><p>Strategas ETF Research“The category has taken in the 2nd most inflows since the Russian Invasion of Ukraine (just behind treasuries), and we'd also note over the +$15 Bn inflows overthe last two months marks one of the stronger historical readings we can find,” Todd Sohn, researcher at Strategas writes.</p><p>ETFs going nuclear</p><p>Although the price of uranium has been on the rise, ETFs pegged to it haven't done as well.</p><p>MarketWatch's Myra Picache notes that uranium prices have gained about 40% since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, touching levels the market hasn't seen in more than a decade—even though the war has little immediate impact on global supplies of the fuel used to&#xa0;generate nuclear energy.</p><p>Prices of the radioactive element were at $59.75 a pound on March 10, according to data from nuclear-fuel consulting firm UxC, marking the richest levels since March 2011.</p><p>ETFs, on the other hand, were swooning this week. Chalk it up to a bit of breather after a run-up, the NorthShore Global Uranium Mining ETF was down substantially on the week, as was the Global X Uranium ETF. Both funds are higher for the month, and year to date period, up at least 5% on the month and at least 11% so far in 2022, respectively.</p><p>A good chunk of the interest in uranium is pegged to climate-change commitments, since&#xa0;nuclear power&#xa0;is a reliable power source that provides zero greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>China ETFs' very good day</p><p>The KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF soared Wednesday, notching its best daily gain in its history, as China vowed to support its economy.</p><p>A separate China-focused fund, the iShares MSCI China ETF MCHI,&#xa0;which has nearly $6 billion in assets, also soared on Wednesday to its best day on record, dating back to its inception in 2011.</p><p>The rally came as Beijing said it would work to&#xa0;stabilize Chinese stock markets&#xa0;and boost economic growth in the first quarter with “concrete actions,” according to state-run&#xa0;Xinhua News Agency.</p><p>Read more here.</p><p>The good</p><p> Top 5 best performers                                   %Performance  KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF KWEB                 16.2  iShares MSCI Sweden ETF EWD                             10.6  EMQQ The Emerging Markets Internet &amp; Ecommerce ETFEMQQ  10.5  U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS                               9.8  Invesco China Technology ETF CQQQ                       8.9</p><p>…and the bad</p><p> Top 5 worst performers                     %Performance  NorthShore Global Uranium Mining ETF URNM  -12.8  VanEck Oil Services ETF OIH                -11.8  Global X Uranium ETF URA                   -9.2  U.S. Oil Fund LP USO                       -7.8  Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE         -7.7</p><p>Top weekly inflows</p><p> Inflows  Vanguard Total stock Market ETF VTI  iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF IVV  Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF VO  Vanguard Small-Cap ETF VB  Vanguard Value ETF VTV  Source: FactSet</p><p> Outflows  SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust SPY  Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF SCHD  Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE  iShares MSCI EAFE Growth ETF EFG  iShares Global Financials ETF IXG</p><p>Popular ETF reads</p><p>Ukraine crisis exposes ETF investors to the perils of herding (FT.com)</p><p>European ETF flows signal concern about recession (CNBC)</p><p>NortonLifeLock Drops 12%; 206 ETFs Affected (ETF.com)</p><p>BlackRock to move €1.4bn corporate bond ETF to ESG index (FT.com)</p><p>India's Oil Woes Scare Off Most ETF Traders Since Pandemic (Bloomberg)</p><p>Cathie Wood's ETF Could Rip Higher (TheStreet.com)</p>",
