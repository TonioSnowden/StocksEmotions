  "text": "<p>   European cloud-services provider OVHcloud plans to launch a possible initial public offering as soon as Monday that could value the business at more than $4.7 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Based in Roubaix, France, OVHcloud rents computing, storage and networking capability to users, overseeing a network of dozens of data centers across North America, Europe, Singapore and Australia. It also operates its own fiber-optic network globally that the company claims gives it a competitive edge. </p><p>   The potential offering comes amid surging demand for cloud services after the coronavirus pandemic accelerate the adoption of digital communication. </p><p>   The challenge and opportunity for OVHcloud, which was founded in 1999 and is formally known as OVH Groupe, will be convincing investors it has the ability to compete with industry behemoths such as Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp.'s Azure and Google Cloud, a unit of Alphabet Inc. </p><p>   Largely owned by the family of founder and chairman Octave Klaba, the company has built its own in-house server technology. </p><p>   An IPO could value OVHcloud at more than 4 billion euros, equivalent to $4.7 billion, some of the people said. The company won't make any final decision on whether to proceed with the offering until it is finished gauging investor interest following a series of meetings. The company is expected to list its shares in Paris, if the offering proceeds. </p><p>   A spokeswoman for OVHcloud declined to comment on a potential IPO. </p><p></p>",
