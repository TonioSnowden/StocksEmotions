  "text": "<p>The founders of a collapsed British energy supplier are in line for a £50mn payout even as every household in the country foots the bill for its failure.</p> <p>Administrators to People's Energy Company, which collapsed last September, have recouped more than £285mn from the sale of its hedged energy, which was bought before the sharp rise in wholesale gas prices last year, according to <a href=\"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09844617/filing-history\">a report</a> filed in April.</p> <p>Under UK insolvency law, that is set to be distributed to shareholders of the failed business once its creditors are paid off.</p> <p>BP, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/3c748949-db81-49f3-80be-17ac71a442e8\">People's Energy's </a>largest secured creditor, has been paid £11mn, according to the administrator's report. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/ccd05942-e442-4e21-906d-4e25d932e4cc\">BP</a> said it supplied gas and electricity to the company&#xa0;and had “recouped outstanding fees as part of the administration process”.</p> <p>David Pike and Karin Sode, who founded People's Energy, are in line for a payout from the proceeds as they held a 25 per cent stake in the company. </p> <p>They could be entitled to receive around £50mn or more once smaller creditors have been paid, according to people with knowledge of the administration process.</p> <p>Edinburgh-based People's Energy, which supplied 350,000 households and 500 business customers, collapsed four years after it was established through a crowdfunding campaign in 2017, when it pledged to tackle fuel poverty in Britain.</p> <p>More than 30 UK energy suppliers have failed over the past year as a result of poor capitalisation, surging wholesale gas prices and the price cap, which is set by the regulator Ofgem and limits how much customers can be charged.</p> <p>At least £820mn in assets — including from the sale of hedged energy — has been recovered from energy firms that have been wound up, according to calculations by Bloomberg, which first reported the People's Energy payout. </p> <p>The cost of transferring customers of a failed business is borne by households through <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43acd434-d66a-41a3-b3b3-de8cffe4757a\">extra charges on customer bills</a>. </p> <p>People's Energy's customers were moved to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a330bb2-3e42-4d0c-988d-81a7225a76ac\"> British Gas</a> at a cost of £283mn to British households.</p> <p>The People's Energy payouts are dependent on a court case in October, where the administrators to numerous collapsed energy companies and Ofgem are asking for guidance on how to manage claims. </p> <p>Alan Whitehead, shadow minister for energy, said the People's Energy payouts should “not be allowed to happen”. “The fact that directors of failed companies can walk away with tens of millions of pounds in profit . . . at a time households are facing an unprecedented cost of living crisis is repugnant,” he said.</p> <p>The government opened up the energy industry to more competition almost a decade ago, with the intention of securing customers better deals, but the market became flooded with smaller suppliers with no industry experience and limited capital. An investigation into supplier failures accused Ofgem of giving entrants a “free bet” — enabling them to join with minimal risk and to exit with almost no downside.</p> <p>Ofgem is also trying to claw back as much as £500mn&#xa0;of the companies' remaining assets to reduce the burden on customers but resolution may take years.</p> <p>People's Energy made large losses in the three years before its administration. </p> <p>Since then, Pike has set up an “ethical” shopping site called Ethibuy. Sode, the former chief executive of People's Energy, is a managing director of UK and Europe for YSC Consulting, according to her LinkedIn page. </p> <p>Pike and Sode had not replied to requests for comment at the time of publication.</p> <p>Alvarez &amp; Marsal, the company's administrator, declined to comment.</p><p>Source: Gill Plimmer 2022 'Founders of failed UK energy supplier in line for £50mn' FT.com 19 July.
