  "text": "<p>THE INTERNET is full of tools for blocking distractions, but Productivity Blocker isn't one. A free tool for blocking work, the Chrome extension, released earlier this year, temporarily bars you from opening applications like Outlook, Dropbox and Slack. Sound counterintuitive? That's the point. Its creators, Kory Brocious, an art director in Knoxville, Tenn., and Steven Nass, a copywriter in New York City, took issue with the glut of software meant to maximize one's output. \"We thought it would be fun to make the opposite,\" said Mr. Brocious.</p><p>I've written about work and productivity, in some form, since 2010. Search Google for \"distraction blocker\" and the top result (after several paid productivity software ads) is a story I wrote earnestly recommending tools that force you to stop scrolling Twitter. When I heard about Productivity Blocker, a sort of riposte, I had to try it.</p><p>Once installed from the Chrome Web Store, the extension functions as a straightforward on/off switch for 80 different work-related websites. The full list not only includes platforms you might expect, like LinkedIn and Google Drive, but also sites for professional development (it'll prevent you from obsessively learning Mandarin with Duolingo) and financial housekeeping (you'll have to toggle it off to pay your credit card bill with Chase). Visit any one of these and you'll be admonished for \"attempting productivity during scheduled leisure time\" and served a list of truly bizarre links. These include the product listing for a disturbing squirrel puppet and a Wikipedia page devoted to animals with human credentials.</p><p>Mr. Brocious says the extension was meant to be a joke. But surprisingly, some say it has made them better workers. Jono Moore, 32, an art director at a Los Angeles ad agency, says he uses Productivity Blocker as a centralized tool for silencing all work-related pings when he's trying to finish anything that calls for more creativity than pounding out a quick note. \"It is difficult to find time to chew on ideas when you're constantly fielding questions, notifications and emails,\" he said.</p><p>Explore Buy Side From WSJ</p><p>* 5 Company Founders Swear by These Home-Office Essentials</p><p>Using the tool this way is risky. It could easily frustrate your co-workers or managers, or anyone who needs your urgent input about a pressing project. Even pausing Slack notifications for half an hour, a more modest reprieve, can have serious repercussions in some workplaces.</p><p>But few in modern offices work too little, said Maura Thomas, a leadership consultant based in Austin, Texas. \"Most organizations have a culture of urgency. We have to respond in a timely manner to communications.\" Once that immediate reaction has become habitual, it becomes difficult to opt out, even when you're technically off the clock.</p><p>Garret Musar, 31, a copywriter based in Knoxville, was struggling with this exact problem, increasingly finding that he was opening Slack at all hours. Downloading Productivity Blocker has helped him enforce clearer boundaries between his work and personal life. \"I installed it as a lark, but it actually changed my weekends,\" he said.</p><p>I took a similar approach, only turning it on when I decided to sign off at the end of each day. I was surprised by just how often I was met with its page of links. I hadn't realized how natural it had become for me to reflexively check in on my ongoing projects, even when I was supposed to be enjoying my weekend. While using the tool, I found more space to relax when I wanted to relax. And when it was time to work, I found myself actually energized and prepared to get things done.</p><p>Plus, I like the links. Mr. Moore does too.</p><p>\"Did you know the mayor of Idyllwild, Calif., is a dog?\" he said. \"Two terms!\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you enforce boundaries after work hours?
