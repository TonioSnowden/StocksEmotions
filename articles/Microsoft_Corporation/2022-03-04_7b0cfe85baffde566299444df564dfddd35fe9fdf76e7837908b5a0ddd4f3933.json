  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>Today's much stronger than expected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5c8010d-5993-4dcb-884d-2dadfcdf37aa\">US jobs report</a> reinforces the US Federal Reserve's plan to increase interest rates, despite the prospect of slower growth as a result of the war in Ukraine. </p> <p>The closely watched non-farms payroll data showed 678,000 jobs were added in February, much higher than the 423,000 expected by analysts and more than January's upwardly revised 481,000. The unemployment rate fell from 4 per cent in January to 3.8 per cent.</p> <p>Fed chief <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b947c196-7b5c-44b0-8769-ef6f66580356\">Jay Powell</a> told Congress this week that the combination of employment gains and increasing inflation supported his case for a quarter-point interest rate increase as the first step in a “series” of rises this year.</p> <p>Today's report also showed monthly wage growth flatlining after a jump the previous month, meaning hourly earnings have risen 5.1 per cent over the past year. Wages have soared in recent months as labour shortages prompt businesses to increase pay to fill a near-record number of vacancies. US businesses reported 10.9mn unfilled positions at the end of last year.</p> <p>Similarly in the UK, labour shortages are feeding through to trade union demands for better pay deals, prompting strikes from universities to the London Underground, as our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b601e59-1dd3-451c-84a0-e60b4d2eb835\">Big Read</a> details. Wages for most people are failing to keep pace with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae3dbaba-11a4-41b5-a408-9fac0c0457dc\">galloping living costs</a>, a situation set to worsen with next month's jump in UK energy prices, fuelling anger among lower-paid key workers.</p> <p>Some groups, such as academics, see it as payback time. “The experience of the pandemic has alienated staff even further,” said one activist. “People were working really hard to keep the show on the road and not getting any consideration back. There was a real sense of disrespect, that our goodwill was not being reciprocated.”</p> <p>The coronavirus crisis has, however, fuelled some positive trends in the labour market. Columnist Sarah O'Connor talks to Harvard's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92be2a2d-aee3-48c5-922b-84eea37072f8\">Claudia Goldin</a> in the latest instalment of our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c06f107-d026-425f-92ff-4c9a89249662\">Economists Exchange</a> series about the pandemic's impact on the gender pay gap and how the shift to flexible working has made top jobs more compatible with family life. </p> <p>“Greedy” jobs is Goldin's term for describing careers in lucrative fields such as finance, law, accounting or engineering that may pay more for longer hours or for those willing to work at weekends or during holidays — jobs that the on-call, at-home parent couldn't possibly take. “In that sense,” she argues, “the flexible work has been made more productive, greedy work has been made less greedy, and that will be a very good thing.”</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe80e279-aad8-442a-b4d5-0a4f5e44e7df#post-44c6d5b0-2f88-4d1b-8c56-e56853ab29bb\">Microsoft</a> became the latest tech company to suspend product sales in Russia </p></li>  <li><p>The UN said the number of Ukrainians running from conflict to neighbouring countries had now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe80e279-aad8-442a-b4d5-0a4f5e44e7df#post-e764db42-5648-4e98-9841-a40a2f57ce8b\">passed 1.3mn</a></p></li>  <li><p>Switzerland said it would freeze Russian-owned <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe80e279-aad8-442a-b4d5-0a4f5e44e7df#post-869d5f72-08ce-481e-8239-14feb21adc61\">crypto assets</a> </p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe80e279-aad8-442a-b4d5-0a4f5e44e7df\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p><strong>Business </strong>and<strong> economic pressure</strong> on Vladimir Putin and his allies has intensified.
