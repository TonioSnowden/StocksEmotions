  "title": "TikTok Work Culture:  Pressure and Secrecy  ---  Ex-U.S. staffers recount litany of stresses  ----  By Georgia Wells, Yoree Koh and Salvador Rodriguez",
  "text": "<p>   With a seemingly bottomless feed of goof-offs, dance-offs and good-natured pranks, TikTok bills itself as the happiest place on the internet. </p><p>   Fueling its success: an exacting management style and demanding internal culture that belie its buoyant public image, say employees at its U.S. offices. </p><p>   The employees, many of them veterans of other major tech companies, say TikTok emphasizes relentless productivity and secrecy to a degree uncommon in the industry. </p><p>   As TikTok continues its torrid growth, those conditions are increasingly a source of tension at U.S. offices of the app, a unit of Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. Founded just six years ago, TikTok recorded the most downloads of any app through the first quarter of 2022, according to analytics firm Sensor Tower. </p><p>   TikTok's U.S. operation had about 1,500 employees as of mid-2020, and TikTok has said it would like to increase that to 10,000. Much of their work involves converting products developed in China for an American audience and tapping the U.S. advertising market, representing one of the boldest experiments in bridging the work cultures of the world's two tech superpowers. </p><p>   In Los Angeles, the base of TikTok's U.S. operation, some employees complain of sleep deprivation exacerbated by frequent weekend work and mandatory meetings with colleagues across the globe. </p><p>   Several former U.S. employees said they averaged 85 hours of meetings a week at TikTok, and had to carve out additional time to complete their work. Another said he persuaded his boss to spare him from working back-to-back all-nighters only after he shared medical lab results showing a potentially life-threatening condition. </p><p>   Former employees described weight fluctuation, stress or emotional lows so severe they sought therapy. One said she felt such pressure to be present during back-to-back meetings at TikTok that she bled through her pants rather than excuse herself to get a tampon. </p><p>   TikTok borrows some of its approach from Amazon.com Inc., also known for a demanding work culture. TikTok executives regularly tell employees \"It's always day one,\" repeating a line popularized by Amazon's Jeff Bezos to encourage innovation and avoid complacency. Other maxims, such as \"Be candid &amp; clear,\" are splashed across TikTok office walls, and employees are judged in part based on their adherence to the concepts. </p><p>   TikTok said it has made adjustments to its practices and work culture to reach its goal of \"building and fostering a team that is empowered to support our growing global community.\" In a statement, it added: \"We encourage a culture of transparency and feedback, and are committed to building an equitable platform and business that allows both our community and our employees to thrive.\" </p><p>   Long hours and tight deadlines are hardly novel at fast-growing tech companies like this, nor is a skewed sleep cycle rare for employees of foreign firms. But TikTok's U.S. workforce has such stresses to an unusual degree, said people who have worked both there and elsewhere in tech. </p><p>   Former employees have taken to social media sites such as YouTube and Medium to recount their experiences at TikTok's U.S. offices. Some describe an emotional high from being in an intense atmosphere. Others list challenges, including documents written in Chinese and translated with software that doesn't always capture the subtleties. </p><p>   \"Working at TikTok stretched me in more ways than I could count, and taught me more about product strategy, execution, and cross-cultural nuances than I could have initially imagined,\" wrote Melody Chu, a former senior product manager who worked on helping creators make money from their content, in a post on Medium. Even so, Ms. Chu, who has described herself as a veteran of Facebook, Roblox and Nextdoor, left TikTok in November. </p><p>   She said she spent so many dinnertimes on calls with colleagues in China rather than with her husband that they sought marriage therapy. Her weight dropped precipitously and she had trouble sleeping, she wrote. All interests, including time with her parents and her own mental health, took a back seat to TikTok. </p><p>   \"If I knew that working at TikTok would cost me this much, I would never have taken the job\" in June 2020, she wrote. Yet she didn't regret having joined, she added, because by doing so she proved to herself that she has what it takes to succeed. </p><p>   Many TikTok employees tolerate the hours and lack of work-life boundaries because of the prospect of a payout if its parent company goes public. \"You want to be on that rocket ship,\" said Pabel Martinez, who was a global account director for ad sales at TikTok until February. </p><p>   Mr. Martinez said he left after he objected to having to work all weekend even though his project was on schedule, and the response he received from a manager was: \"That's not how we do business here.\" </p><p>   ByteDance put plans to go public on hold about a year ago when regulators urged it to focus on data security. </p><p>   TikTok's revenue reached about $4 billion in 2021 and is projected to be as much as $12 billion this year, according to a person familiar with its business operations. </p><p>   Last year, Singapore-based Shou Zi Chew became TikTok's chief executive, replacing an interim CEO, Vanessa Pappas, who now works out of Los Angeles as TikTok's chief operating officer. U.S. employees say the move further anchored TikTok's power base in the East. American Kevin Mayer was TikTok's CEO in early 2020 but left after about three months, at a time when the Trump administration was trying to force a sale of the app to an American company. </p><p>   TikTok doesn't make an organization chart available to employees. It's a policy common among Chinese companies that want to deter competitors from poaching. </p><p>   The result can be to leave people confused about whom to contact on other teams or about who is sending them messages. For months, some ex-employees said, members of the human resources and finance teams in the New York office didn't know there were separate teams performing the same functions in California. </p><p>   Jamie Lim Yin Yin, a former employee in Singapore, said when she got emails from colleagues, she had to look them up on LinkedIn to figure out what team they were on. </p><p>   \"Let's just say LinkedIn was a tab on my browser that was constantly open,\" she said in a YouTube video. </p><p>   A TikTok spokeswoman said there is a way for employees to look up worker profiles. </p><p>   Mr. Martinez, the former ad-sales account director, said presentations at TikTok frequently included blurred or missing numbers, and his managers instructed him not to share certain data with lower-level employees. \"The signal that I received was: 'We don't trust you,'\" he said. \"There's a level of secrecy at TikTok that was very different\" from other tech companies where he had worked. </p><p>   TikTok attracts plenty of applicants, yet it appears to grapple with high attrition. Lucas Ou-Yang, a former TikTok engineering team manager in Mountain View, Calif., wrote in a thread on Twitter that the pressure to keep up with Chinese colleagues and work on their schedules led all 10 of the product managers he worked with to quit about a year into the job. </p><p>   In November, after a unit in the engineering department hosted an all-hands meeting to discuss a flood of U.S. departures, executives agreed to a new policy of trying to hold meetings in English if not all participants speak Chinese. </p><p>   Last year, the Chinese government told employers that a work schedule at some Chinese tech firms of 9-9-6, meaning 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. 6 days a week, wasn't legal. ByteDance said it would adopt a \"1075\" standard: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. five days a week. Many employees say the longer hours remain the expectation. </p><p>   Some ex-U.S. employees said to attend virtual meetings with managers in Beijing, they had to begin their workweek on Sunday afternoon, which is Monday morning in China. </p><p>   \"I actually think I developed a sleep disorder from working so late into the evenings,\" Chloe Shih, a former employee in California, said in a YouTube video. \"Knowing that the majority of the company is awake when I am supposed to be sleeping gives me so much anxiety at night.\" </p><p>   \"While meetings often span time zones, as is typical for global companies, we continue to focus on ways to provide employees support and flexibility,\" said the TikTok spokeswoman. She added that TikTok encourages workers to use personal time off, schedules no-meeting times and discourages off-hours messaging. </p><p>   Many tech startups give new employees restricted stock units, or RSUs, to entice them to accept less salary for a chance at a big payout if the firm goes public. TikTok didn't begin offering RSUs to a majority of U.S. employees as part of hiring and bonus packages until the summer of 2020. When it did, it didn't extend the awards to most existing U.S. employees, creating confusion and frustration. </p><p>   At a town hall meeting in April 2021, Dylan Juhnke, who worked on brand partnerships at the app, asked the head of U.S. human resources why senior leaders dodged questions about pay, according to people familiar with the exchange. He said if TikTok wasn't planning to provide answers to such questions, it should say so. </p><p>   Not long after, Mr. Juhnke was reprimanded for his behavior at the town hall. Human resources launched an inquiry and discussed whether TikTok could fire him, said a person familiar with the discussions. He resigned a couple of months later. TikTok didn't comment on accounts of specific employee experiences. </p><p>   TikTok describes itself as a home for \"joyful, entertaining, diverse and unexpected experiences.\" In a memo posted internally when he left, Mr. Juhnke said: \"The way TikTok employees are being treated is the exact opposite of what the TikTok platform stands for.\" </p><p></p>",
