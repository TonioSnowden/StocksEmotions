  "title": "Biden Stays Silent on Mar-a-Lago Search; President's advisers don't want him wading into controversy over Justice Department's investigation of Donald Trump's handling of classified documents",
  "text": "<p>But in the two weeks since federal agents searched Mr. Trump's Florida home, Mr. Biden has gone silent about the former president, declining to weigh in on the federal investigation into how the former president handled classified documents. Mr. Biden and his aides say it would be inappropriate to comment on the continuing investigation, and his advisers are hesitant to amplify a controversy that is already dominating cable news and drawing attention away from Democrats' recent legislative victories.</p><p>As he vacationed with his family in South Carolina and Delaware, Mr. Biden ignored questions about the investigation, largely avoiding the pack of reporters who trail him everywhere he goes. Following an event at the White House last week in which the president signed into law Democrats' climate, healthcare and tax legislation, White House staff drowned out questions about Mr. Trump by blasting music through the speakers.</p><p>Now, with midterm campaign season getting into full swing, Mr. Biden plans to make criticizing Mr. Trump's agenda a key part of his message as he seeks to paint a contrast with Republicans, aides said. But he has no plans to wade into the political minefield of the Mar-a-Lago search. Mr. Biden will deliver a speech on Thursday at a rally in Maryland with Democratic officials.</p><p>The White House has said little publicly about the national security implications of the classified material that was recovered from Mar-a-Lago, even as some Democrats have raised concerns that the incident could have exposed some of the government's highly guarded secrets. Republican lawmakers, for their part, have demanded more information about how and why the FBI conducted the search. Mr. Trump has said the search was politically motivated and unnecessary.</p><p>The president's aides have said Mr. Biden had no advance knowledge of the search and learned about it through press reports. A White House official said on Monday that the president hadn't been briefed about the investigation.</p><p>Attorney General Merrick Garland took the rare step of addressing the search, but only after three days of silence and immense political pressure to do so. In his Aug. 11 statement from the podium of the Justice Department, Mr. Garland took no questions from the media and limited his statement only to confirmation of the raid, noting that any such action requires a finding of probable cause.</p><p>He added that the Justice Department \"filed the motion to make public the warrant and receipt in light of the former president's public confirmation of the search, the surrounding circumstances and the substantial public interest in this matter.\"</p><p>White House spokesman Andrew Bates said this week that the White House has a standing policy of not weighing in on Justice Department investigations.</p><p>Mr. Biden has alleged that Mr. Trump as president exerted too much influence over the Justice Department. Mr. Biden's advisers want to avoid the perception that the investigation is being driven by politics.</p><p>At the same time, Mr. Biden's advisers don't want to give Mr. Trump more attention than he's already getting in the aftermath of the search, according to administration officials and others familiar with the matter. They are leery of being drawn into a public back-and-forth with Mr. Trump over the investigation, and some polls have shown Republican voters rallying to Mr. Trump's side since the FBI's search.</p><p>Many in the GOP contend the search was politically motivated. Rep. Elise Stefanik (R., N.Y.), a senior House Republican, said earlier this month that the FBI's search was a \"complete abuse and overreach of its authority.\"</p><p>Already, some Democratic strategists have privately expressed frustration about how the controversy over the search has overshadowed what the president and his aides believe has been a successful few weeks. In the days surrounding House and Senate passage of Democrats' climate and tax legislation, the news was largely dominated by the fallout from the search of Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you agree with the Biden administration's communication strategy when it comes to former President Trump? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Following his vacation, Mr. Biden is expected to ramp up the pace of his domestic travel, part of an effort to sell the administration's legislative accomplishments and campaign on behalf of members of Congress.</p><p>The White House has been framing a contrast message that will criticize Mr. Trump and his allies, homing in on what they call a \"MAGA agenda that serves the wealthiest, corporations and themselves,\" according to a recent memo released by Mr. Biden's senior aides. That strategy is driven by Democrats' desire to make the midterm elections a choice between their agenda and that of Republicans, rather than a more straightforward referendum on the president—whose approval rating is hovering near 40%—and his party.</p><p>Republicans counter that the White House is focusing on Mr. Trump to distract from the administration's not doing enough to address high inflation and voters' concerns about the economy.</p><p>Mr. Biden started criticizing Mr. Trump and his supporters more directly in May, when the White House began transitioning to a midterms-focused message.</p><p>\"This is not your father's Republican Party,\" Mr. Biden said at a Democratic fundraiser in May. \"This is a MAGA party. This is the MAGA party.\"</p><p>The term, \"ultra MAGA,\" which Mr. Biden used in several speeches this summer, came after polling from Democratic groups showed that a significant chunk of swing voters viewed Mr. Trump's slogan negatively.</p><p>Tarini Parti contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Andrew Restuccia at andrew.restuccia@wsj.com and Vivian Salama at vivian.salama@wsj.com</p><p>Biden Stays Silent on Mar-a-Lago Search</p>",
