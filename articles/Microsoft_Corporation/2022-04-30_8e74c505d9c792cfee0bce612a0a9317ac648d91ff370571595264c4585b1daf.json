  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Activision's Kotick Could See Windfall in Purchase",
  "text": "<p>Friday's disclosure, in Activision's annual proxy statement, reflects the company's definitive accounting for Mr. Kotick's stake in the company and potential severance under existing agreements. It provides investors their best window to date into the potential windfall Mr. Kotick could receive after the acquisition, which is pending regulatory approval. Activision and Microsoft have said they expect it to close by spring 2023. Santa Monica, Calif.-based Activision said on Thursday that its shareholders approved the merger.</p><p>Mr. Kotick, 59 years old, has been roiled in controversy, as state and federal regulators have accused Activision of mishandling employee sexual-harassment cases and gender-pay disparity. In October, Mr. Kotick said he asked Activision's board to reduce his salary to the minimum allowed under California law for salaried workers -- $62,500 -- and that he would forgo bonuses and equity grants. The announcement was part of a series of changes Mr. Kotick said were aimed at making the company more diverse and safer for employees.</p>",
