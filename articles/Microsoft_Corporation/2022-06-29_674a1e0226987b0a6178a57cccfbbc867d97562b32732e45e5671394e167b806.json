  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>Finally some better news in the fight against inflation. Germany reported today that CPI fell from 8.7 per cent&#xa0;last month to a better than expected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c049cbc-efbe-4b1c-9568-bdf41a6deb9c#post-bdc5cfdb-887d-4fc2-9175-6c54d91904e\">8.2 per cent</a>&#xa0;in the year to June, helped by government measures such as cuts in fuel taxes and a special discount on public transport.</p> <p>The data was not yet a turning point, “but rather evidence that it is currently governments and not central banks that can bring down inflation”, said Carsten Brzeski, head of macro research at ING.</p> <p>The news contrasted sharply with data from Spain earlier in the day that showed prices rising at their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c049cbc-efbe-4b1c-9568-bdf41a6deb9c#post-37dd6754-011f-46bf-8bc2-8ee1fdb64468\">fastest rate for 37 years</a>, hitting 10 per cent in June, driven by surges in energy and food. The underlying rate, excluding these two volatile items, hit 5.5 per cent — the country's highest level since 1993.</p> <p>Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has announced proposals to extend and increase Spain's €16bn package of relief by €9bn, including reductions in electricity tax and public transport costs, help for pensioners and one-off payments for lower earners.</p> <p>The easing of inflation growth in Germany will be given a cautious welcome by European Central Bank policymakers at their forum for central banks in Sintra, Portugal. </p> <p>Yesterday, ECB president Christine Lagarde <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9801a5c-e864-4c9d-87a2-1e7450300bc7\">hardened its message on inflation</a>, saying the central bank would act in “a determined and sustained manner”, especially if price expectations rose sharply among consumers and businesses.</p> <p>Today, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/colbyLsmith/status/1542135021007429632\">she added</a>: “I don't think we are going to go back to that environment of low inflation . . . there are forces that have been unleashed . . . that we're facing now that are going to change the picture and the landscape within which we operate.” </p> <p>Inflation data for the combined eurozone are expected to hit a new record of 8.3 per cent when released on Friday.</p> <p>The ECB is planning to start raising interest rates in July for the first time since 2011, beginning with a quarter percentage point increase, followed by a bigger rise in September.
