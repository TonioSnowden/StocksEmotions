  "title": "Microsoft/LSEG: tech giants scramble to tie in data-rich stock exchanges",
  "text": "<p>US tech giants have a penchant for taking stakes in start-ups they do business with. Microsoft, valued at $1.83tn, qualifies as the former. The London Stock Exchange Group, established in 1698, hardly resembles the latter. So the purchase of a 4 per cent stake in LSEG worth about £1.5bn ($1.8bn) by the software leviathan requires scrutiny.</p> <p>On one level, it has become normal for cloud computing companies to extend stake-taking to larger customers. The extra dimension is that LSEG is itself now primarily a data company. Indices and price data matter more to it than stuffy old share trading.</p> <p>The tie-in should therefore provoke greater interest among regulators than other incremental selldowns by investment consortiums — in this case Blackstone and Thomson Reuters. The more data that giants such as Microsoft can aggregate, the greater its value.</p> <p>With $107bn of cash and short-term investments to hand this is an affordable deal for Microsoft. LSE has agreed to a minimum cloud-related spend of $2.8bn over 10 years. Microsoft sees a $5bn opportunity. </p> <p>Cloud computing should attract resilient spending. By 2026, Gartner predicts it will exceed $1tn. Microsoft's cloud revenue was close to $26bn in the last quarter — up more than two-thirds in two years. </p> <p>Exchanges are lucrative but demanding customers. Financial markets data is perfect for bulk storage and rapid analytics. Google set the scene last year with a 10-year cloud deal with derivatives exchange operator <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f120cd0d-73a9-4b0e-8e3e-e5449f33bbf5\">CME</a>, investing $1bn in the business. AWS has a tie-in with Nasdaq. </p> <p>Both Microsoft and LSEG say the cloud computing deal is not exclusive. They are aware regulatory concerns have slowed dealmaking. The Financial Conduct Authority, a UK watchdog, has launched a “discussion” on the competitive impact of Big Tech in financial services. </p> <p>Data aggregation has impelled exchange transactions including LSEG's purchase of Refinitiv data businesses and FTSE International. Tie-ups with cloud giants are a natural next step. Professional investors should keep a close eye on the trade-off between improved services and cost.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Microsoft/LSEG: tech giants scramble to tie in data-rich stock exchanges' FT.com 12 December.
