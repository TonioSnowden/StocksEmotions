  "text": "<p>Hybrid working is creating a “culture crisis” for companies by eroding staff loyalty and making it harder to retain talented employees as well as detect fraud, auditors have warned. </p> <p>Almost half of senior auditors believe the shift to remote working during the pandemic has damaged organisational culture, according to new research by the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors. </p> <p>The poll of more than 700 senior auditors across the UK and Europe “highlights a rising post-pandemic organisational culture crisis, which has the potential to trigger a chain of negative impacts across wider business structures”, the CIIA said. </p> <p>Heli Mooney, head of internal audit at Ryanair, said: “Most businesses are focusing on ironing out issues of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce81651a-7451-4781-a9b8-85c96f2c5be0\">the hybrid working model</a> from technical and practical perspectives. What is not dissected enough is how new working models can potentially erode organisational culture.”</p> <p>“Dilution of a strong organisational culture can trigger a myriad of . . . risks, not least on talent management and fraud,” she added. </p> <p>Many companies — including tech groups Google and Microsoft, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e04e5a4-fce6-4007-b032-befde6895a43\">accountants EY, KPMG and PwC</a> and law firms Clifford Chance and Freshfields — have already committed to making working from home a permanent part of their business model.</p> <p>But John Wood, chief executive of the CIIA, warned that “the risk of a culture crisis must be considered by all businesses pursuing a hybrid business model”.</p> <p>“It has never been more urgent for businesses to develop strong systems to both identify and mitigate risks to organisational culture, before it becomes a crisis,” he added.</p> <p>Business continuity, crisis management and disaster response was the category of risk most heightened by the pandemic and deemed an area of major concern by two-thirds of respondents, the CIIA poll found. Cyber and data security was second, followed by health, safety and security. </p> <p>The erosion of organisational culture shot up as an area of worry, ranking fourth from 11th place a year earlier, and is now above concerns such as financial, liquidity and insolvency risks, and digital disruption. </p> <p>Reduced face-to-face interaction between colleagues in a hybrid environment would curtail previous processes for building culture and team cohesion, said the CIIA, a professional association representing 10,000 internal auditors across all sectors in the UK and Ireland. </p> <p>“Water cooler moments or conversations over the top of a desk, simply can't happen in a virtual environment and they take conscious thought to recreate when working remotely,” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dc461e5b-37c5-44f4-aaad-0406b82230f2\">Hywel Ball, UK chair of accountant EY</a>, said. </p> <p>“Simple actions, like ensuring junior colleagues are invited or updated after meetings, can make a really big difference to whether people feel included.”</p> <p>Companies should mitigate the risks of remote working to their culture by including reviews of working practices in their internal controls and ensuring audit teams are empowered to challenge management to preserve culture as the shift to hybrid working continues, the CIIA said. </p> <p>“We've implemented a behavioural risk assessment which aims to be a forward-looking view of culture, seeking drivers of red flags that could lead to wider issues,” said Alison McFadyen, group head of internal audit at Standard Chartered Bank. The group interviewed individuals and encouraged people to speak up “to understand behaviours that could give rise to organisational culture risk”, she added.</p><p>Source: Michael O’Dwyer 2021 'Hybrid working makes it harder to detect fraud, auditors warn' FT.com 28 May.
