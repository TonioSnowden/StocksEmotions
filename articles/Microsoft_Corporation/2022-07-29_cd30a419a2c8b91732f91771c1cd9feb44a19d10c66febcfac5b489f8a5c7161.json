  "title": "Political Economics: The Dollar Emergency Is Worse Than You Think",
  "text": "<p>And here we are. Microsoft and IBM are among the big names on a growing list of American companies reporting stress in part because the exchange rate weighs on dollar-denominated overseas earnings. Europeans, whose common currency slid below parity with the dollar two weeks ago, find a deteriorating exchange rate stoking inflation, especially via energy prices. Ditto Japan, where the yen bobs at multidecade lows against the dollar.</p><p>As the global economy evolves apace, so do the vectors by which currency chaos can hobble it. Long gone are the days of assuming a mechanistic relationship between a falling exchange rate and rising export competitiveness or vice versa. Rapid exchange-rate swings now transmit themselves via rampant foreign borrowing in dollars (up to $13.4 trillion at last count) or trade invoicing denominated in dollars even when neither party is American. Both mechanisms widen the scope of financial distress among ordinary companies when rates swing.</p><p>Meanwhile, measures that once protected against currency fluctuations provide little help. Following a series of developing-economy crises in the 1980s and '90s, it became received wisdom that emerging markets ought to barricade themselves against the dollar by borrowing in their own currencies.</p><p>This they have done, mostly. The only hitch is that most of their creditors remain offshore -- and, all too often, those creditors keep their own books denominated in dollars, as a new paper from the Bank for International Settlements warns. Large or unexpected currency swings can wreak havoc with dollar-denominated portfolio values. This in turn can trigger large capital outflows (or inflows) for reasons entirely independent of a country's economic or policy merits, solely because foreign investors must rebalance their portfolios.</p><p>These are some of the practical ways uncontrolled exchange-rate fluctuations endanger financial stability at home and abroad, but these fluctuations also present a philosophical threat that cuts to the core of the global market economy.</p><p>A frequent complaint against modern economic policy, monetary and fiscal, is that it promotes financialization of the economy -- the explosion of balance-sheet engineering and debt-fueled jiggery-pokery that yield sugar-rush profit hits. Such financialization comes at the expense of sustained investment in innovation and entrepreneurship. Surveying the current exchange-rate chaos, it's hard not to see this policy failure writ large.</p><p>Look at those corporate-earnings reports. Note that although an exchange-rate swing is more or less the same for everyone, the effects are very different from one company to the next.</p><p>To start, it matters where your headquarters sit and in which currency you keep your books. While Wall Street is experiencing something of a dollar bloodbath, Germany Inc. (for example) is floating on a rising tide of depreciated euros -- a currency bonus as high as 30 billion euros across the 40 companies in Germany's flagship Dax index. This partly cushions the blow of rising energy costs at home.</p><p>It also matters what sort of company you are. A perverse consequence of a rapid dollar appreciation is that it punishes companies that have expanded their entrepreneurial footprint globally. Meanwhile, domestic-facing American companies at least have some hope that by driving down dollar commodity prices, the stronger greenback will contain their raw-materials costs.</p><p>And it matters how financially savvy your management is. Hedging always is available to help globally exposed companies manage foreign-exchange risk. IBM, for instance, hedges its exposure to 35 currencies. But this works only if the company's finance wizards are smart and lucky enough to hedge correctly. And it comes at a cost that's hard to pin down with any precision across the economy but must stretch to the tens of billions of dollars, at least, for global trade and investment flows in the trillions each year.</p><p>The great policy sin is that none of this has anything whatever to do with building a better mousetrap. How, then, is a business or an individual to get ahead? This is the key question for any political economy, and the West's capitalist answer should be \"through patient hard work, investment and entrepreneurship.\" Instead, as the currency crisis illustrates, the answer increasingly is \"through a lucky choice of location and a deft deployment of complex financial derivatives.\" This is no way to run a market economy, or to maintain political support for one.</p><p>The flexible-exchange regime central banks now are pushing to the limit was billed as a way to facilitate the efficient functioning of the global market economy. It's instead becoming another threat to that economy, practically and philosophically.</p>",
