Markets have been trying to regroup after a string of losses that were briefly halted on Monday.</p><p>The Dow and S&amp;P 500 have lost ground for six of the last seven days and the Nasdaq has posted five straight days of losses. For September, the Dow is off by more than 2% and the S&amp;P 500 is down about 1.8%.</p><p>Read:Shop early and expect to pay more: Supply chain issues could be a stumbling block to upbeat holiday shopping forecasts</p><p>“I suspect the market is likely to bounce around as it tries to stabilize. From a near term prospective the market is somewhat oversold, therefore we could get a bounce. However the cautious attitude will likely prevail since the decline has been accompanied by low volume,” Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, said in emailed comments.</p><p>Meanwhile, the New York Fed's Empire State business conditions index surged 16 points to 34.3 in September, the regional Fed bank said Wednesday. Economists had expected a reading of 17.2, according to a survey by The Wall Street Journal. The index stood at 18.3 in August. Any reading above zero indicates improving conditions.</p><p>Separately, the import price index dropped 0.3% last month,&#xa0;the government said Wednesday, marking the first decline in 10 months. The drop was mostly attributed to the lower cost of foreign oil and industrial supplies.</p><p>Overnight news saw a batch of downbeat data from China, where August retail sales grew a disappointing 2.5% from a year earlier, from 8.5% growth in July. Industrial output in August and fixed-asset investment also fell short of expectations. China's zero-tolerance approach to controlling Covid-19 is posing difficulties for retailers and industry with relatively small outbreaks in the Fujian province this week provoking further lockdowns affecting millions.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Shares of Microsoft Corp.MSFT rose 1.3% in premarket trading.
