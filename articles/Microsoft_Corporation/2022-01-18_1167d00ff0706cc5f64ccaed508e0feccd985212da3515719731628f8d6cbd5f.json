  "text": "<p>Bill Gates has issued a warning of pandemics far worse than Covid-19 as he called on governments to contribute billions of dollars to prepare for the next global outbreak. </p> <p>The philanthropist said that while the Omicron and Delta variants of coronavirus were some of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3aa95ed-18b3-406a-b611-9845dd07bbbc\">most transmissive viruses</a> ever seen, the world could have had to face a pathogen causing a far higher rate of fatalities or severe disease. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4557f2c-2464-46bd-a844-d08cadc3da59\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> and the UK's Wellcome Trust are giving $300m to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which helped form the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40abf052-41e9-11ea-bdb5-169ba7be433d\">Covax programme</a> to deliver vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. The CEPI is trying to raise $3.5bn as it aims to cut the time required to develop a new vaccine to just 100 days. </p> <p>Gates said the world's priorities were “strange” and that it had fallen to philanthropists and rich governments to address vaccine inequity. </p> <p>“When we talk about spending billions to save . . . trillions of economic damage and tens of billions of lives, it's a pretty good insurance policy,” Gates said. </p> <p>He added that much of the innovation to prepare for a future pandemic could also be useful in tackling existing global health problems, such as by creating a vaccine for HIV and better shots for tuberculosis and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6d08998-4c25-468e-b99d-20b8e86f53e6\">malaria</a>. </p> <p>Gates said the two big funders of vaccine development during the Covid-19 pandemic, CEPI and the US government, were “brave” to put money at risk to create broad portfolios of potential shots. </p> <p>But he admitted that more needed to be done to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54bec909-1f06-43ff-9bc0-391202eabf9d\">increase supplies to vaccinate the world</a>.</p> <p>“It was at-risk money that caused the trials to take place. So there was a huge global benefit. We're all a lot smarter now. And we need more capacity for the next time,” he said. </p> <p>Professor Cherry Gagandeep Kang, a CEPI board member and virologist at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, India, said we should expect countries to put their national interest “front and centre”.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The rest of the world that cannot afford to have these commitments made upfront needs somebody in our corner. And CEPI is that organisation,” she said. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9bf3c3a-f21a-4345-9241-d49b656480a7\">Sir Jeremy Farrar</a>, director of the Wellcome Trust, said it was “critical” that funds came not just from international development budgets but more broadly from across government funding and philanthropy. </p> <p>He described how CEPI was formed five years ago after the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic. “We were then and we are now living in what I think is an era of more frequent and more complex epidemics and pandemics,” he said.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/d6c22464-6dce-42eb-81d4-38e8b55d8c12.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Hannah Kuchler in London 2022 'Bill Gates warns of pandemics potentially far worse than Covid' FT.com 18 January.
