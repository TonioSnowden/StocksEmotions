  "title": "Summer Interns Jilt Companies as Better Offers Come Along; Some young professionals in training are job-hopping between internships before they even start, frustrating companies and campus career advisers",
  "text": "<p>What's causing them to change their minds? More money, housing stipends, flexible work hours, the ability to live in a student's preferred city and work at big-name companies that can add heft to new graduates' résumés.</p><p>Najaah Chambliss, a computer-science major, accepted an internship in October for the summer of 2022 at a defense company. Then, earlier this year, the 21-year-old senior got an offer from Microsoft Corp. at nearly double the salary, with money for relocating to Seattle and a housing stipend.</p><p>\"It was definitely a no-brainer,\" she said, adding that she wanted to diversify her résumé with a big-tech role after prior internships in the defense sector.</p><p>Interns are rejoicing at their new leverage in a hot labor market. Some 15% of students who had accepted a 2022 internship offer in November said they were still \"actively searching\" for another offer, according to a survey of more than 100 students by research and analytics company Veris Insights.</p><p>Corporate recruiters, including at Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. and General Mills Inc., said more students are backing out of internship offers this year. Liberty Mutual said it is reviewing pay benchmarks. Other employers and campus career offices said some companies have boosted intern pay for certain in-demand students. Still more employers are stepping up contact with students between the time they accept offers and when they start jobs to keep them engaged.</p><p>Maura Quinn, who leads Liberty Mutual's campus recruiting and early-talent programs, said her team uses a \"keep in touch campaign\" that includes months of company social hours and coffee chats as part of an extended onboarding and get-to-know-you process.</p><p>The company also encourages accepted interns to post a company logo on social media to announce the new position. Incoming intern José Eduardo Reyes said he did so on LinkedIn and received a flurry of messages from other employers trying to poach him. He told them no, citing his happiness with the offer's starting salary and the company's culture.</p><p>\"Competition has been ferocious,\" said Graham Donald, the founder and president of Campus Talent Lab, a company that brings campus recruiters and HR professionals together for professional development and networking. \"We're seeing students saying, 'I can change my mind at any point.'\"</p><p>Students used to feel sheepish about backing out of offers, but Elizabeth Diley, campus talent acquisition leader at General Mills, said she has observed less remorse. The cereal and food maker usually hires about 150 interns each year; now it plans to over-hire, betting that some percentage of interns will renege on offers before their summer jobs start, she said.</p><p>Companies typically recruit summer interns early in the academic year to lock in potential talent. The problem this year with commitments made months ago is that the hot job market is generating lots of new offers that can lure students away.</p><p>Tyler Eshleman, a senior studying finance at Grand Valley State University, turned down two internship offers in the fall without something else lined up. Unlike last year, when he took the first offer he received, Mr. Eshleman said he felt sure he'd find a better position eventually. He recently took an offer from PNC Financial Services Group Inc. after several interviews and an \"intern super day\" where he met employees over Zoom, which he said made him feel more connected to the organization.</p><p>Reneging on offers can have consequences at some universities. Campus career offices, wary of damaging relationships with employers, consider such moves a breach of professional norms.</p><p>At Michigan State University, undergraduates who renege on accepted offers won't be able to access Handshake, an online job platform that many colleges pay for to help students and new grads find listings for entry-level work. Lehigh University, which does the same, asks students who change their minds to send a letter of apology to the company. Both colleges said that reneging on offers is serious and that most students don't do so, though Michigan State officials acknowledged there have been more cases this year.</p><p>M.B.A. candidates can face steeper penalties for reneging, including a fine of up to $2,500 at Cornell University's SC Johnson College of Business and a 16-hour service project at the University of California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business.</p><p>Abby Scott, assistant dean for M.B.A. career management and corporate partnerships at the Haas School, said most years fewer than 10 students raise the possibility of reneging on an internship with her office. The first step in determining a sanction, she said, is to understand the student's motivations. For example, a student might have a new family obligation that requires a different role.</p><p>But if a Haas graduate student accepts a job with a big tech company while still aggressively interviewing with a startup, Ms. Scott said, \"we really push on them and question, 'How did you feel that you could be in good conscience?'\"</p><p>Mark W. Nelson, dean of Cornell's business school, said students are reminded of \"expectations and responsibilities as they approach the job market.\" Money from the fines levied against students who renege on offers bolsters the salaries of their peers who pursue less-lucrative internships, such as in the nonprofit sector, according to policies reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Punishing students for pursuing the best job offer they can get is out of step with the job market, said Beth Hendler-Grunt, president of Next Great Step, a career counseling firm whose clients are students and recent grads seeking their first jobs.</p><p>\"They're not thinking about what's good for the students—their skill set, their financial needs,\" she said of institutions that impose such penalties. \"I don't think that's how the real world works. People change jobs all the time.\"</p><p>Write to Lindsay Ellis at lindsay.ellis@wsj.com</p><p>Summer Interns Jilt Companies as Better Offers Come Along</p>",
