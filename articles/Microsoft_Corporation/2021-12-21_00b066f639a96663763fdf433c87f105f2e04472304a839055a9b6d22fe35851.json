  "title": "OnlyFans Names Its Marketing Chief as CEO; Creator network said the appointment is effective immediately as founder Tim Stokely exits",
  "text": "<p>A spokesperson for the company didn't immediately respond to a question about OnlyFans' new marketing leadership.</p><p>\"I am proud to assume this role,\" Ms. Gan said. \"I look forward to continuing to work closely with our creator community to help them maximize control over, and monetize, their content.\"</p><p>Ms. Gan has been OnlyFans' marketing chief since September 2020, according to her LinkedIn profile. She joined after a stint as vice president of marketing and publicity at Cannabis Cafe, a cannabis restaurant in West Hollywood, and before that worked in brand and communications roles for companies such as Red Bull Media House and health food and protein brand Quest Nutrition.</p><p>The British-born Mr. Stokely in 2016 founded Fenix International Ltd., owner and operator of OnlyFans, to provide a platform for content creators who wanted to make money directly from fans, rather than from advertisers. The company, which takes a 20% cut of its creators' earnings, now hosts content from more than two million creators, who are watched by more than 180 million registered users, per a company statement.</p><p>Celebrities such as the musician Cardi B and actor Bella Thorne have uploaded content to OnlyFans, but the platform has become known as a place to find sexually explicit content, due to its willingness to allow adult entertainers and sex workers to publish to the site.</p><p>That relationship was strained in August, when OnlyFans said it would ban sexually explicit content at what it said was the request of its banking partners and payment providersâ€”a move it suspended one week later following an outcry from creators.</p><p>Tasked with walking the tightrope between the demands of creators and financial backers, Ms. Gan will also join a fairly small club of chief executives who started out as marketers or communications executives. It includes H&amp;R Block's Jeff Jones, a former CMO at Target, and Kristin Lemkau, who in 2019 was promoted to chief executive officer of J.P. Morgan Wealth Management.</p><p>Mr. Stokely chose Ms. Gan as his successor, according to a company statement.</p><p>\"OnlyFans is still a new company and Ami brings a fresh energy and reflects who we are as a business,\" he said in the statement.</p><p>Write to Katie Deighton at katie.deighton@wsj.com</p><p>OnlyFans Names Its Marketing Chief as CEO</p>",
