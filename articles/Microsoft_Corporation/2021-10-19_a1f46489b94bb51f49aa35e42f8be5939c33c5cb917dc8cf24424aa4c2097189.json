  "text": "<p>    Facebook Inc. is planning to create 10,000 jobs in the European Union over the next five years to build a virtual realm it sees as a key component of its future and a major driver of new technology investment. </p><p>   The U.S. social-media giant on Sunday said it would embark on a recruiting drive for highly skilled workers in the region to help build a \"metaverse,\" an online realm where users engage with one another using technologies including virtual and augmented reality. The company said it would focus on hiring in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland, the Netherlands and Ireland. </p><p>   Facebook said the investment \"is a vote of confidence in the strength of the European tech industry and the potential of European tech talent.\" </p><p>   \"As we begin the journey of bringing the metaverse to life, the need for highly specialized engineers is one of Facebook's most pressing priorities,\" it said. </p><p>   Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg laid out his vision for the metaverse over the summer, describing it as a successor to the mobile internet that would be a major driver of new technology investment. The company in September unveiled plans to invest $50 million to build the virtual space, noting that parts of it could take 10 to 15 years to fully develop. </p><p>   Other big tech companies are developing hardware and software products for the metaverse, including Nvidia Corp., Roblox Corp., Epic Games Inc. and Microsoft Corp. </p><p></p>",
