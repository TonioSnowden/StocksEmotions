  "text": "<p>At the same time, the era of tech since the 2008-09 financial crisis produced a lot of ridiculous experiments, laughable products and oft-repeated mistakes.</p><p>Even if it might not be dead, an era this over-the-top deserves a eulogy. And now seems a fine time, with the Nasdaq Composite Index having fallen 33% in 2022, its sharpest full-year drop by far since 2008, after rising nearly 10-fold in the 13 years through 2021.</p><p>So here, in no particular order, are some of the more memorable, hilarious, regrettable, and also unexpectedly triumphant happenings in one of the biggest tech bubbles yet.</p><p>Crypto takes flight -- and comes crashing down</p><p>Given what a year it's been for cryptocurrencies, it's perhaps ironic that the world's first cryptocurrency, bitcoin, was inspired by the last financial crisis, of 2008.</p><p>After years of crypto fans' aggressive social-media marketing, a collapse in the values of cryptocurrencies and the firms that handled them laid bare how made-up computer money isn't, in fact, all that different from conventional financial systems -- at least when it comes to manias and their unwinding.</p><p>Amid the wreckage of collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, crypto lenders Celsius Network and BlockFi, the TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin, and other crypto institutions that 2022 left defunct or damaged, there is blame to go around.</p><p>Many of those who lost the most were the crypto evangelists who taunted skeptics with slogans like \"have fun staying poor.\" They also had their venture-capitalist enablers. Regulators were largely absent. Then there were everyday investors who bought into something they didn't understand based on the dubious promise of steady, high returns.</p><p>In this way, few things better characterize the past decade-plus of tech hype more than crypto. It democratized the opportunities of high-growth companies -- and the risk of losing it all.</p><p>So many robots</p><p>I've written more than a dozen columns over the past decade about the new, more-capable breed of robots now used in everything from cooking food and unloading trucks to clearing sewers and making small apartments more livable.</p><p>But there also are plenty of examples of how robot innovators' reach exceeded their grasp.</p><p>In 2016, Zume, which aimed to make pizzas with robots in the back of delivery trucks, launched in Mountain View, Calif. After a 2018 investment by SoftBank that valued the company at $2.25 billion, Zume laid off half its staff in 2020 and pivoted to other applications for its robots -- most recently, molding agricultural waste into sustainable containers.</p><p>SoftBank Robotics built a humanoid Pepper robot, which was supposed to fill in for humans in customer-service roles. Last summer, the company sold its European branch to United Robotics Group, which ceased production of the robot.</p><p>Then there were the robot taxis. We were promised they were just around the corner. Developing them was supposedly an existential necessity for Uber and Lyft, not to mention the secret sauce that justified Tesla's lofty valuation. It turned out that autonomous driving could take place only in limited circumstances, and its rollout -- almost exclusively by Cruise and Waymo -- has been much slower than promised.</p><p>The transportation revolution still hasn't arrived</p><p>In 2018, scooter-sharing companies Bird and Lime became the fastest U.S. startups ever to reach $1 billion valuations. This November, Bird warned in a regulatory filing that it might run out of money. In December, the company said it would net an additional $30 million or so in financing, and in the third quarter of 2022 achieved for the first time ever \"positive adjusted EBITDA,\" while generating $73 million in revenue, says a company spokeswoman.</p><p>Lime and others persist, so \"micromobility\" might prove lasting (when weather and local regulations allow), but it has hardly been revolutionary.</p><p>At least four flying-car companies went public in 2020 and 2021, and now almost every player in that industry is fighting for survival.</p><p>Face computers</p><p>When Google Glass made its debut in 2013, the company commissioned two giant barges as mobile showrooms. Those barges were never finished, and were eventually sold for scrap. In recent years, many others have tried and mostly failed to make smart glasses and headsets happen, from Microsoft's troubled HoloLens to Snap's short-lived consumer Spectacles and Meta's mostly forgettablecollaboration with Ray Ban.</p><p>Meta has in the past declined to comment on sales of its Ray Ban camera-equipped glasses, saying only that the company has been \"very pleased with user reception to date.\"</p><p>With Apple working on its own \"augmented reality\" headset, it's possible that face computers are one of those dreams so tempting to engineers that they just can't help but try to make them happen.</p><p>The marketplace economy</p><p>One of the most lasting innovations of the tech boom has been the \"sharing\" economy and its kin, the marketplace company. What Uber, Airbnb, Etsy and the bulk of Amazon's retail business have in common is that they operate platforms for what are called two-sided markets, where the primary job of the company is to sit in the middle and take a share of the transactions they facilitate.</p><p>It's easy to forget there was a time when Uber and Airbnb were new and it seemed implausible that people would widely adopt the habit of getting into strangers' cars or staying in their homes. And yet these became giant businesses, demonstrating that sometimes the least-plausible ideas can be among the most transformative.</p><p>And while Amazon pioneered a marketplace model of retail -- building on ideas from that darling of an earlier tech boom, eBay -- this model of directly connecting manufacturers to consumers is now widespread, and coming to dominate every kind of online retail.</p><p>It might sound cynical to say that one of the most impactful innovations of the tech boom is the reinvention of the middleman. But it's also illustrative: What are middlemen and the marketplaces they run but conveyors and translators of information -- areas in which the tech industry has always excelled?</p><p>In these successes there are lessons for everyone in business. Generations of academics and entrepreneurs will attempt to process and learn from them. For now, we should recognize that sometimes what's needed to mark an era, in addition to a eulogy, is an epitaph:</p><p>What a boom it's been.</p>",
