  "title": "REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial):  Eric Greitens Outdoes Himself",
  "text": "<p>   Republicans should be able to retake the Senate in November, but they may blow their chance by nominating candidates whom too many voters find offensive. A leading example is Missouri Republican Senate candidate Eric Greitens, who is running a TV ad that shows remarkably bad judgment, even for him. </p><p>   The online ad has Mr. Greitens toting a shotgun and declaring that he's hunting for \"RINO,\" short for a Republican In Name Only, who the ad says \"feeds on corruption and is marked by the stripes of cowardice.\" Armed men in military gear break into a home in the ad, followed by Mr. Greitens, who exhorts: \"Join the MAGA crew. Get a RINO hunting permit. There's no bagging limit, no tagging limit, and it doesn't expire until we save our country.\" </p><p>   Plenty of politicians appear with guns in ads as a show of support for the Second Amendment. But the Greitens ad is a call to target those with differing political beliefs, potentially with violence. Mr. Greitens is angling for a Donald Trump endorsement before the Aug. 2 primary, but this is desperate stuff. </p><p>   In response to criticism, Mr. Greitens claims any \"normal person\" would understand the ad is \"clearly a metaphor.\" But it is nonetheless a reckless message at a time when some on the right and left seem to think violence is justified to achieve their goals. </p><p>   Mr. Greitens was once a rising GOP star, but he resigned as Missouri Governor in 2018 after an affair with a hairdresser led to claims of blackmail, a Missouri House investigation, a criminal charge (later dropped), and threats of impeachment. Mr. Greitens's former wife has accused him in court documents of physical abuse toward her and one of their sons. </p><p>   Mr. Greitens denies this -- and child-custody fights aren't pretty. But Democrats won't hesitate to use all of this in the fall campaign. They're praying he's the GOP nominee because they know he would be their best chance to gain a Senate seat and keep Chuck Schumer as Majority Leader. </p><p></p>",
