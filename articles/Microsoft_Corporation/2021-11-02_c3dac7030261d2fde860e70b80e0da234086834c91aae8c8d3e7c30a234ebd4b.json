  "text": "<p>\"We need to weigh the positive use cases for facial recognition against growing societal concerns, especially as regulators have yet to provide clear rules,\" he said in a post on Meta's website.</p><p>The change marks a major shift for the company, which has long touted the convenience facial recognition delivers for users and pushed back against privacy advocates who find the technology invasive. It also could have implications for the so-called metaverse, which is a series of virtual online communities that Meta Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg touted last week as the future of the company.</p><p>Those communities are powered by virtual reality and other advanced technologies, as well as data about users.</p><p>Facebook last year reached a $550 million settlement with the state of Illinois, which alleged the company was wrongfully using facial-recognition technology on residents without their consent. Facebook didn't admit to wrongdoing.</p><p>In its blog post, the company called Tuesday's decision \"one of the largest shifts in facial-recognition usage in the technology's history.\"</p><p>More than a third of the social-platform's daily active users are currently opted into the setting, Facebook said.</p><p>With the change, Facebook's technology will no longer automatically recognize if someone's face pops up in videos, photos or Facebook memories, the platform said. Users also won't see a suggested tag in videos or photos they may be featured in.</p><p>The company said it would continue to pursue ways to use facial-recognition as a tool for users to verify their identities.</p><p>The pivot comes as the company has been under substantial fire for its practices. A recent Wall Street Journal investigation showed the social-media company knew its platforms were riddled with flaws that cause harm. The Journal's reporting also found that the company didn't fix those flaws. Mr. Zuckerberg has said the criticism paints a false picture of the company he co-founded.</p><p>Big tech companies have generally faced scrutiny on Capitol Hill over their sizable reach and power.</p><p>Facial recognition, outside of Facebook, has become a popular way for some people to access things like their smartphones. Many of the biggest tech giants have grappled with its use by law enforcement and the potential for biasin how the technology is applied. Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. said last year they wouldn't allow police to use their facial-recognition toolsâ€”and joined other firms in calling for clearer rules around the surveillance technology.</p><p>\"Every new technology brings with it potential for both benefit and concern, and we want to find the right balance,\" Mr. Pesenti said in his post Tuesday. \"In the case of facial recognition, its long-term role in society needs to be debated in the open, and among those who will be most impacted by it.\"</p><p>Facebook's shift away from using its facial-recognition system will also affect a technology called automatic alt text, which is used for making image descriptions for those visually impaired, Mr. Pesenti said. That technology won't try to identify each person featured in a photo using facial recognition anymore, but it will still be able to determine the number of people in a photo, he said.</p><p>The Path of Facial Recognition Technology</p><p>* The Next Face of AI (July 8)</p><p>* Faces Are the Next Target for Fraudsters (July 7)</p><p>* Lawmakers Re-Introduce Bill That Would Ban Facial-Recognition Technology (June 16)</p><p>* Should Government Halt the Use of Facial-Recognition Technology?
