  "title": "The New Workplace (A Special Report)  ---  Do's & Don'ts of Onboarding 'Buddies':  They work well when done right  ----  By Joann S. Lublin",
  "text": "<p>\n  New hires struggle to feel connected to colleagues they rarely see face to face. One increasingly popular solution: match newcomers with buddies. </p><p>\n  This idea existed before the pandemic, but the boom in remote work boosted interest in buddy systems. In this setup, newcomers get assigned a co-worker to orient them. Buddies help individuals assimilate and flourish through informal counseling about key tasks, unspoken rules and expected attire. </p><p>\n  The potential benefit? A smoother onboarding process. Remote newcomers get to know the company -- which often is tough if you aren't working in an office. </p><p>\n  Salesforce.com Inc. beefed up orientation for its buddies -- dubbed Trail Guides -- once Covid-19 hit because \"we saw how critical this role was,\" says Jenny Simmons, head of global onboarding. </p><p>\n  But it's unclear whether buddy programs will work all that well in hybrid settings. Certain companies struggled with their systems during the pandemic because remote onboarding was so hard. Meanwhile, buddies face challenges of their own: They are sometimes burdened with a lot of unrecognized labor for a role that's often voluntary. </p><p>\n  \"Buddy programs have all the characteristics of how women often get lured into taking on 'nonpromotable' work,\" says Lise Vesterlund, a University of Pittsburgh economics professor and a co-author of \"The No Club: Putting a Stop to Women's Dead-End Work.\" \"Such tasks will derail their careers.\" </p><p>\n  Getting things right is especially pressing as the number of remote workers soars: About four in 10 employed Americans now toil outside the office part of the week or work entirely from home, according to a Gallup poll conducted in February. </p><p>\n  Making things worse, it has gotten tougher for businesses to hang on to employees. About 38% of Americans landing jobs since January 2021 quit within a year, according to a survey conducted for The Wall Street Journal by pollsters YouGov and Cappfinity, a human-resources tech firm. </p><p>\n  Here are six do's and don'ts that might improve the effectiveness of buddy programs for the postpandemic workplace: </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Don't force somebody to become a buddy. </p><p>\n  When adding new buddies, companies commonly ask for volunteers. Those who raise their hands are clearly interested in the role, while draftees might be less enthusiastic. </p><p>\n  Buddies sometimes get robust formal training, which can be helpful. At other times, employers only provide checklists about expected tasks and timelines -- \"or offer no guidance at all,\" says Talya Bauer, a management professor at Portland State University's business school and onboarding researcher. </p><p>\n  It is also important to screen potential buddies carefully. Employers usually prefer individuals who are long-tenured, personable and successful in their present position. </p><p>\n  Yet not every staffer has \"the time, patience, discipline and energy required to properly teach,\" says Travis Hansen, chief executive of Eddy, an HR-software firm. He recently tightened his screening of potential buddies after one criticized Eddy to an assigned recruit and bragged about not working hard there. (The disgruntled buddy ended up quitting.) </p><p>\n  \"Selecting the right buddy can make a difference in whether a new employee thrives in a hybrid environment,\" says Gloria Chen, chief people officer of Adobe Inc., where numerous staffers still work from home part of the time. </p><p>\n  Adobe buddies get guidelines about expected tasks. They include: Show up for regularly scheduled sessions, arrange introductions, and practice active listening, such as asking a new employee about their preferred communication method. </p><p>\n  Gregory Marshall, a senior technical writer hired by Adobe in January, says his buddy helped him gain rapid access to their team's processes and documents. The result? \"I became a productive employee within six weeks rather than the typical six months,\" he says. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Recommend that buddies reach out before the newcomer arrives. </p><p>\n  Metadot, a small provider of business software, prefers that buddies begin onboarding the week before someone starts at the now fully remote company. Otherwise, adds CEO Daniel Guermeur, \"the new workplace is like a big black box.\" </p><p>\n  Ron Middleton repeatedly conferred with his buddy before he began his job as customer-success manager of a Metadot subsidiary. In online chats and video meetings, for example, he sought guidance about reporting to Mr. Guermeur. </p><p>\n  \"Don't be afraid to ask something that you think might be a difficult conversation,\" his buddy said. </p><p>\n  The advance outreach quashed Mr. Middleton's jitters. \"I felt a lot more comfortable the first day at Metadot than at any other job,\" the 59-year-old tech veteran says. \"I was hitting the ground running.\" </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Encourage buddies and fresh hires to meet often. </p><p>\n  Some buddies meet just a few times during a recruit's inaugural week. But frequent buddy encounters bring newcomers up to speed faster. \"A buddy program should be in place for at least the first six months of an employee's tenure,\" says Jeaneen Andrews-Feldman, chief marketing and experience officer at the Society for Human Resource Management. </p><p>\n  In a 2018 study of its newcomers by Microsoft Corp., about 97% told Microsoft researchers that onboarding buddies aided them in becoming productive quickly -- if they met with their buddies more than eight times in their first 90 days. </p><p>\n  The less contact new hires had with buddies, the less they got out of the experience. That 97% figure dropped to 56% for workers who conferred with buddies as rarely as just once in the first 90 days. </p><p>\n  Microsoft subsequently advised managers that onboarding buddies represent \"a need-to-have,\" says Joe Whittinghill, corporate vice president of talent, learning and insights, adding, \"More than 80% of employees hired on since the pandemic have had an onboarding buddy\" -- nearly 10 percentage points higher than before Covid-19. </p><p>\n  Simone Douglas joined Microsoft as a customer engineer following her 2020 college graduation. She met her buddy virtually more than eight times during her initial 90 days. He identified key Microsoft staffers to meet and offered tips on dealing with customers and getting internal training. The buddy system offered \"the support I needed to be successful in my role,\" she says. Earlier this year, Ms. Douglas accepted a lateral move to program manager. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Don't use the same buddies over and over. </p><p>\n  Buddies risk burnout when aiding newcomers over an extended period. What's more, an individual may already be performing too many other nonpromotable tasks to justify being a buddy, Prof. Vesterlund says. </p><p>\n  At Landed, a company that aids prospective home buyers, buddies found themselves overwhelmed by their volunteer workload. </p><p>\n  The company changed its policy so that managers no longer have to use buddies, says Kathy Denning, senior director of customer sales. Landed introduced other strategies to help new hires. For example, the company covers newcomers' expenses when they grab a snack, coffee or beer with any co-worker in their first three months. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Assign two buddies to every newcomer. </p><p>\n  Some companies try to avoid buddy burnout by using multiple buddies. Buffer Inc., which helps businesses market and expand their online presence, gives new hires a \"role\" buddy and a \"culture\" buddy. Each covers different aspects of working there. </p><p>\n  \"Having two buddies really shares the cognitive load,\" says Nicole Miller, director of people at Buffer until late April. The company has been fully remote since 2014. </p><p>\n  Role buddies usually work in the same team as the recruit, and advise newcomers about the nuts and bolts of their new job. A culture buddy, meanwhile, \"is a tenured teammate who knows Buffer's history and culture,\" Ms. Miller adds. Culture buddies are encouraged to cover topics such as corporate lingo and why the company values feedback and transparency. </p><p>\n  Such buddies have coached nearly all of Buffer's 86 employees because \"remote work can feel very isolating,\" says Ms. Miller. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Incorporate buddy experiences into performance reviews and promotion decisions. </p><p>\n  Employers typically reward buddies with dinner vouchers, mementos or extra vacation. However, few buddies reap career benefits. Several experts believe they should. </p><p>\n  Requiring that buddy work be remembered at review time would signal \"this is something that really matters,\" says Linda Babcock, a Carnegie Mellon University economics professor and another co-author of \"The No Club.\" </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Ms. Lublin, former career columnist at The Wall Street Journal, is the author of \"Power Moms: How Executive Mothers Navigate Work and Life.\" She can be reached at joann.lublin@wsj.com. </p><p></p>",
