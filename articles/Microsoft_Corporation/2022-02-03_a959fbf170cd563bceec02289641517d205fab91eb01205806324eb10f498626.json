  "text": "<p>Andrzej Sadoś, Poland's ambassador to the EU, tells us he is concerned about attacks on his country, which shares a border with Ukraine. \"The goal is to divide the EU. The goal is to test if the governmental institutions are ready to defend,\" he said, referring to cyberattacks on Poland, Germany and other European countries last year that the union attributed to hackers backed by Russia. Hackers leaked Polish politicians' email messages online.</p><p>Continued below.</p><p>Digital Event: How to Detect and Respond to Cyber Attacks</p><p>100% security is impossible, so businesses must prepare for the inevitable cyber attack. This event will discuss cyber vulnerabilities organizations are ignoring and strategies to reduce cyber risk.</p><p>Register Now</p><p>Anne Neuberger, the U.S. deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, is in Europe this week for a series of meetings with NATO, EU and government officials from several European countries. It would be wise for NATO and allied countries to be \"fully prepared for potential destabilizing activity,\" she said in a call with reporters on Wednesday. \"We're prepared for the range of that, from...resilience, to incident response, to calling out that activity if it does occur.\"</p><p>Future Russian operations could target sectors essential to Ukrainians, such as electric utilities, water, financial services and aviation, said Rachel Ellehuus, deputy director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.</p><p>A Jan. 23 alert from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned of similar hacks of U.S. companies if Russia \"perceived a U.S. or NATO response to a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine threatened its long-term national security.\"</p><p>The American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine sent an email to its members last month after Microsoft warned that hackers installed wiper malware to disable computer systems in at least two local government agencies, said Andy Hunder, president of the business group. Mr. Hunder said he hasn't heard that any companies have been affected by the malware but his organization is holding online meetings and sending alerts to inform members about cyber risks.</p><p>\"Businesses are continuing to operate,\" he said.</p><p>Read the full story.</p><p>Related: As Ukraine Prepares for Cyberattacks, Officials Warn of Malware Disguised as Ransomware</p><p>Russia and other countries might use software to destroy data and mask government involvement, cyber experts say. (WSJ)</p><p>More Cyber News</p><p>U.S. is moving—some say too slowly—to address TikTok security risk. The Biden administration is moving to revise federal rules to address potential security risks from TikTok and other foreign-owned apps, eight months after opting not to pursue a forced shutdown of the Chinese-owned video-sharing platform. Under a proposed rule change at the Commerce Department, foreign apps deemed unacceptable security risks could effectively be barred. That could force some platforms such as TikTok to submit to third-party auditing, source-code examination and monitoring of the logs that show user data.</p><p>The U.S. military has already banned its members from using the app on government-issued devices. Some lawmakers including Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) say the White House is moving too slowly to come up with a comprehensive plan. (WSJ)</p><p>TikTok has hired Catherine Razzano, a senior executive from Panasonic Corp.'s in-flight entertainment and communications business, to oversee legal compliance matters. TikTok has said repeatedly that it doesn't share information on American users with the Chinese government, and that its data is held on servers in the U.S. with backup servers in Singapore.

Germany's top cybersecurity agency said in a report that a ransomware strain known as BlackCat is to blame for tech disruptions at two units of logistics provider Marquard &amp; Bahls AG. Fuel replenishment is delayed at some gas stations, including some operated by Royal Dutch Shell PLC, in the northern part of the country. Shell said it has rerouted some fuel shipments to other storage facilities while the Marquard units work to recover.

KP Snacks, which makes PopChips, Tyrrells and 14 other salty-snack brands, told retailers in a letter on Wednesday that deliveries are delayed because of a ransomware incident. Order and dispatch systems are affected, the letter said. (Better Retailing)</p><p>The Conti hacking group has claimed responsibility for the attack, posting employee data it claims was stolen from KP Snacks. (Bleeping Computer)</p><p>Careers</p><p>Newsletter Extra: Cyber Hiring</p><p>Senior U.S. officials say they are still figuring out how to solve cybersecurity talent shortages and that the process will take time, after a Congressionally mandated report criticized the government's hiring practices and the lack of a single strategy to increase its cyber workforce.</p><p>Chris Inglis, the White House's National Cyber Director, should take the lead in developing such a strategy to work across agencies and other government departments, said a report published Tuesday by the National Academy of Public Administration, a nonprofit academic institution. Around half a million cybersecurity jobs across the U.S. are unfilled, the report said, citing an estimate from the Commerce Department's National Institute for Standards and Technology.</p><p>John Costello, chief of staff for Mr. Inglis, said that interagency discussions are underway, but that the process may need to be slow to be effective. Coordinating between departments to ensure that a patchwork of systems, processes and hiring practices doesn't further complicate workforce issues is important, he said.</p><p>\"It is necessary to do this right, and to make sure that it has a lasting impact,\" he said, while speaking on a virtual panel hosted Wednesday by NAPA to discuss the report's findings.</p><p>The report was required under the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act. It was designed to examine cybersecurity workforce programs at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and to make recommendations for new initiatives or changes to existing practices. The report also warned that CISA's Cybersecurity Defense Education and Training branch, which handles workforce issues, is approaching the limits of what it can accomplish without further staff beyond its roughly three dozen personnel. It may also need new authorities to form partnerships with the private sector on workforce issues, NAPA said.</p><p>CISA director Jen Easterly has made growing the U.S. government's cybersecurity workforce one of her key priorities. In November, the Department of Homeland Security, of which CISA is a part, launched a cybersecurity talent management system designed to streamline the application and hiring process for government jobs.</p><p>\"I think the key is us really going into the communities, going to where individuals are, and us taking the initiative to go to the talent and not just expect that we can sit in Washington and have the talent come to us,\" said Kiersten Todt, CISA's chief of staff, on the same panel as Mr. Costello.</p><p>—James Rundle</p><p>Privacy</p><p>350,000</p><p>Number of patients of ReproSource Fertility Diagnostics Inc. receiving notification that their personal data was compromised in an August ransomware attack on the Massachusetts fertility clinic.
