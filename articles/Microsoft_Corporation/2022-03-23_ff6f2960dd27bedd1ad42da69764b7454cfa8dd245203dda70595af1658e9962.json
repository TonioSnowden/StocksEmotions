  "title": "Okta Under Fire Over Handling of Security Incident; The identity-protection company acknowledged the breach two months after spotting suspicious activity",
  "text": "<p>Several customers have publicly chastised Okta for a slow drip of information that left them uncertain about what to do. The fallout highlights how communication is key in response to breaches, cyber experts say, particularly as security teams race to contain hackers who use technology suppliers as springboards for wide-ranging attacks.</p><p>\"This, going forward, will be a case study in mismanaging a third-party breach,\" said Jake Williams, a security analyst with IANS Research, a consulting firm. \"You control the narrative, not your customers, not your vendors, not threat actors.\"</p><p>The aftermath of a cybersecurity incident can challenge even the most prepared firms, said Meredith Griffanti, co-head of the cybersecurity and data privacy communications practice at business advisory firm FTI Consulting Inc. While lawyers, security staff, forensic investigators, crisis-communications specialists and others may all be scrambling to obtain and convey information, it's crucial that it is done so in a controlled manner, she said.</p><p>\"There are a lot of cooks in the kitchen, and it's super important that everyone is consistent and knows what the story is before they go out and start making definitive statements,\" said Ms. Griffanti, who managed communications for credit bureau Equifax Inc. during its 2017 data breach.</p><p>In the Okta case, the hackers themselves are adding to the confusion, leaving some customers under the impression that Okta is reacting to its alleged attackers rather than communicating proactively.</p><p>Lapsus$'s initial claim of a breach came with a warning for Okta's clients. The group said on Telegram that \"our focus was ONLY on okta customers\" as opposed to Okta itself. A relatively new criminal extortion group, Lapsus$ has been tied to recent attacks on tech giant Microsoft Corp. and chipmaker Nvidia Corp.</p><p>On Tuesday morning, Okta Chief Executive Todd McKinnon said on Twitter that the company believed screenshots posted alongside the message from Lapsus$ were connected to suspicious activity Okta had seen in January but didn't disclose.</p><p>\"The Okta service has not been breached and remains fully operational,\" Chief Security Officer David Bradbury said in a blog post Tuesday morning. \"There are no corrective actions that need to be taken by our customers.\"</p><p>But Lapsus$ continued trolling Okta on its Telegram channel, which has 45,000 subscribers, claiming that the firm was downplaying the potential impacts on its customers. Okta responded later Tuesday with a more detailed blog post by Mr. Bradbury, who offered a timeline of the company's response in the hope \"that it will illuminate why I am confident in our conclusions.\"</p><p>Mr. Bradbury said Okta's security team on Jan. 20 noticed unusual behavior on the account of a customer-support engineer employed by a vendor, Sykes, which is a division of Miami-based call-center company Sitel Group. Okta reported the apparent incident to Sitel the next day and Sitel contracted an outside forensics firm that investigated the incident through Feb. 28, Mr. Bradbury said.</p><p>Okta received a summary of the report on March 17, four days before Lapsus$ posted screenshots on Telegram. Sitel provided the full version of the report on Tuesday, Mr. Bradbury said in the blog post.</p><p>\"I am greatly disappointed by the long period of time that transpired between our notification to Sitel and the issuance of the complete investigation report,\" he said.</p><p>A spokesman for Sitel Group confirmed a January security breach on \"parts of the Sykes network\" but declined to comment further. Okta didn't respond to a request for additional comment.</p><p>Some customers haven't hidden their displeasure. The cloud-infrastructure and security provider Cloudflare Inc. publicly mulled dumping Okta as a vendor and published its own blog post with tips on how security teams should hunt for threats. Amit Yoran, chief executive of security firm Tenable Inc., wrote in a LinkedIn post Wednesday that the breach should have been disclosed either in January or after a timely forensic analysis.</p><p>\"As a customer, all we can say is that Okta has not contacted us,\" Mr. Yoran said.</p><p>Theresa Payton, chief executive of cyber consultancy Fortalice Solutions, said she is advising her customers to assume a breach, review their logs to check for failed login attempts and ensure that multifactor authentication is working properly.</p><p>\"They can still turn this around,\" Ms. Payton said about Okta. \"But it's going to require transparency in their communications.\"</p><p>In a Wednesday morning webinar with customers, Okta's Mr. Bradbury said the company should have moved faster after receiving the initial report about the incident on March 17, adding that he expects some questions will remain unanswered.</p><p>The event lasted about 10 minutes. Mr. Bradbury took no questions.</p><p>Write to David Uberti at david.uberti@wsj.com  and James Rundle at james.rundle@wsj.com</p>",
