  "title": "Russia's Boardrooms Face Exodus of Western Directors; Western executives and former officials are quitting their posts at Russian companies in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, but some are hanging on",
  "text": "<p>The resignations are the latest blow to Russian companies already grappling with the fallout of a fierce volley of U.S. and European sanctions in response to the invasion of Ukraine and could complicate any potential future return to business-as-usual with the West. Many Western companies, from major oil companies to car makers, have separately announced plans to pause operations in Russia or pull back from the country.</p><p>Still, many high-profile Western directors, including a former senior State Department official and German chancellor, remain in their posts, though more are expected to resign in the coming weeks.</p><p>When considering their position, directors say they have to weigh several factors, including their fiduciary duty to shareholders and often long associations with their companies, against international outrage at Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Toby Gati, a former National Security Council member in charge of Russia, said she resigned from Lukoil PJSC's board late Sunday night after realizing it would be impossible to influence President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine. Mrs. Gati said she couldn't live with the consequences of Mr. Putin's actions, including the fate of \"little children saying goodbye to their father at the train station and not knowing if they will ever see them again.\"</p><p>A law in Russia that threatens prison time for anyone publishing what authorities consider to be false information about the country's invasion of Ukraine was also a factor. \"How can you be an independent director and worry about saying something which may be regarded as a criminal offense,\" she said.</p><p>Mrs. Gati said she and Lukoil's three other independent directors had tried to use their position to publicly object to the invasion. The quartet agreed on a Zoom call in late February that \"the invasion was going to be a total disaster for Ukrainians, for Russia, for Lukoil and for the global system,\" said Mrs. Gati, who is based in Washington, D.C.</p><p>The directors sent a letter to Lukoil's senior management on March 1 stressing their belief that the company should publicly call for a cease-fire in Ukraine. Two days later, Lukoil published a statement from the board of directors that Mrs. Gati supported. But as the invasion continued, she resigned.</p><p>One of the other independent directors, former Austrian chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel, resigned. The other two, Briton Roger Munnings and Russia-born Pavel Teplukhin, remain on the board.</p><p>Mr. Schüssel, Mr. Munnings and Mr. Teplukhin didn't respond to requests for comment. Lukoil didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Elsewhere, Greg Barker, a former U.K. government minister, on Monday resigned as chairman of EN+ Group International PJSC, the majority owner of aluminum giant United Co. Rusal PLC. Also Monday, the U.K.-based chairman and five other board members stepped down from Polymetal International PLC, a Russian precious-metals company.</p><p>Other resignations include that of Maria Gordon, a Russian-raised but U.K.-based former fund manager, who stepped down from the boards of diamond company Alrosa PJSC and Russian exchange operator, the Moscow Exchange MICEX-RTS PJSC.</p><p>Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a corporate governance specialist at the Yale School of Management, predicts that with several foreign board members now having quit, many of the rest will soon follow. An initial trickle of companies exiting Russia, that started with BP PLC and Shell PLC, soon became an exodus, he added.</p><p>\"It becomes a huge reputational issue for them,\" he said.</p><p>One director who recently resigned from a Russian company said they considered factors including their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders, good relationships with others at the business and a belief that independent directors are important in ensuring companies comply with sanctions.</p><p>In the end, the director said those factors were outweighed by the moral implications of staying on the board as Russia invaded Ukraine.</p><p>Four foreign-based directors of Severstal PAO resigned last week after the European Union sanctioned the steel company's majority owner, Alexey Mordashov. The directors said the sanctions would have made it legally difficult for them to stay on.</p><p>Most of Russia's biggest companies, though, remain unsanctioned, meaning there isn't a legal compunction for their foreign directors to resign.</p><p>Westerns remaining on Russian boards include Gerhard Schröder, the former chancellor of Germany, at Rosneft and gas producer Gazprom. Mr. Schroder said in a LinkedIn post that Russia had a responsibility to end the war in Ukraine, but that there had been mistakes from both sides in the relationship between Moscow and the West.</p><p>Others include Christopher Bancroft Burnham, a former State Department official who is the senior independent director of EN+; Gareth Penny, the chairman of Norilsk Nickel; and Xavier Rolet, the French former head of London Stock Exchange Group PLC, who is chairman of fertilizer-maker PJSC PhosAgro. All three didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Lukoil's Mr. Munnings also remains a director of Norilsk Nickel and Sistema JSFC, the investment company.</p><p>Many Russian companies have raised money in London over the past two decades, resulting in lots of British directors serving on Russian boards.</p><p>Those directors have come in for particular criticism since the invasion. Last week the U.K.'s Institute of Directors said that British executives have a moral duty to resign from governance roles in the Russian economy.</p><p>On Monday, Liz Truss, Britain's foreign secretary, told a Parliamentary committee that the country needed to see more directors stand down. \"There were a number of people who got too close to the Putin regime,\" she said.</p><p>Several lawmakers had called for En+'s Mr. Barker to stand down from his role.</p><p>For several weeks Mr. Barker fought back, telling the British press that he had a \"real responsibility\" for thousands of employees on the ground in Ukraine. Rusal owns a refinery in the country, but most of its operations are outside the country.</p><p>Mr. Barker was paid $4 million from his role in 2020, according to EN+'s annual report. Directors paid in rubles could suffer a big pay cut given the recent collapse of the Russian currency.</p><p>Yale's Mr. Sonnenfeld said that many board members and companies likely assumed tensions would calm down. However, as the invasion continues and Western governments respond, that is no longer the case.</p><p>He likened the situation to Apartheid South Africa in the 1980s, where companies and directors at first talked of constructive engagement to pressure the regime to abandon white rule, before eventually mainly pulling out amid rising public pressure.</p><p>Max Colchester contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alistair MacDonald at alistair.macdonald@wsj.com and Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com</p><p>Russia's Boardrooms Face Exodus of Western Directors</p>",
