  "text": "<p>Auction sales will post a record year, calculates Christine Bourron, chief executive of the analytics company Pi-eX. Her running total puts sales at Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips at $13.6bn, up 12 per cent from last year and already above the previous high of $13.2bn for the full year 2014. The priciest work came courtesy of the collection of Thomas and Doris Ammann: Andy Warhol's “Shot Sage Blue Marilyn” (1964), which sold for $170mn at Christie's in May ($195mn with fees).</p> <p>Single-owner private collections, including Microsoft co-founder <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09ddb706-c11f-45c8-a5c5-483722d12acb\">Paul Allen's $1.6bn sales</a> at Christie's last month, have been a key driver — and key distortion, Bourron says: “Behind the glittering smokescreen of iconic collections, public auctions across the world have not performed as well.” Sotheby's confirms its public auction sales are projected to reach $5.4bn this year, down from $6bn in 2021. Christie's is set to have sold at least $7.1bn of art, up from $5.4bn.</p> <p>However, there's discomfort in a separate analysis released this week, the Burns Halperin Report, which tracks the representation of black American and female-identifying artists. This finds that “perceptions of progress in the art world are largely a myth”. Between 2008 and mid-2022, art by women accounted for 3.3 per cent of all auction sales; art by black American artists was at just 2 per cent, while black American female artists, “where racism and sexism intersect”, as the survey puts it, comprised just 0.1 per cent of the total $187bn of sales.</p>  <p><strong>A record year</strong> also comes from the Paris-headquartered auction house Artcurial, marking the company's 20th year in business. Its fine art, cars and other luxury sales are on track to make €216.5mn, up from €169mn last year and its previous high of €210mn in 2016. Its business in continental Europe is on a par with Sotheby's and Christie's in the region, notes Artcurial's owner, chair and chief executive Nicolas Orlowski.</p> <p>He says that this year was characterised by high demand particularly for interior design objects, highlighting a sofa (1947), armchair (1939) and coffee table (c1954) by the designer Jean Royère, which sold for €1.7mn combined (with fees). Among their 17 items that sold for more than €1mn — up from seven last year — was Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin's delicious “Le panier de fraises des bois” (1761), which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0437e828-c44c-48bb-af9e-766f41f600ce\">made an artist record of €24.4mn</a> in March.</p> <p>This year shows how far the market in France has come since its auction sector was deregulated in 2001, the year before Orlowski co-founded Artcurial, he says. The last few months of 2022 were tougher, he acknowledges: “It's still strong, there's still demand, it's just a little less booming.” The group as a whole, which now includes a property and thoroughbred horses business, made sales of €1.6bn.</p>  <p><strong>Paul Allen</strong> had much more art than Christie's could offer in its recent two-day sale and works will continue to creep on to the market. They already have another Canaletto (two sold above estimates in its evening sale on November 9). This time they offer a bigger and later work, a view of the Rialto bridge during a royal visit in 1740, with an estimate of $2.5mn-$3.5mn, on January 27. The work is guaranteed to sell, with proceeds going to charitable causes, as with the rest of the collection so far.</p>  <p><strong>Sotheby's had the best</strong> of the Old Masters evening sales in London this month, topped by “Venus and Adonis” (c1555-57) by Titian and his workshop, which sold for £9.5mn (est £8mn-£12mn, £11.2mn with fees). The December 7 sale made a total of £27mn (est £22mn-£33mn, £33mn with fees), dominated by 17 of the 35 works, mostly Dutch and Flemish paintings, which came from the late Spanish collector Juan Manuel Grasset. These guaranteed works made a within-estimate £10.3mn (£12.7mn with fees, one unsold).</p> <p>The Sotheby's sale marked its best total for an Old Masters auction in London since before the pandemic. “People do want to see things in this market,” says Alexander Bell, co-chair of Sotheby's Old Masters paintings business. Brexit has made little difference to consignments, adds fellow co-chair George Gordon, with 65 per cent of works, including the Grasset collection, coming from continental Europe. Christie's equivalent sale on December 8 made a total £11mn (£13mn with fees), also within estimate.</p> <p>Separately, through sales in Hong Kong in October and London last week, Sotheby's has quietly racked up more than £100mn from the refined collection of 400-plus pieces of art, furniture, porcelain, jade and other collectibles that belonged to late Hong Kong businessman Sir Joseph Hotung (1930-2021). Hotung latterly lived in London and bequeathed valuable porcelains and jades to the British Museum, where he was a trustee and which has a gallery named after him. Highlights of his London sales included a rare portrait by Edgar Degas from 1874 of Eugène Manet, brother of the Impressionist painter, which sold for £5.3mn (est £4mn-£6mn, £6.3mn with fees).</p>  <p><strong>The London gallery</strong> Modern Art now represents the Dutch artist René Daniëls and will mount an exhibition of his works on paper made between 1976 and 1987, their first UK showing (January 12-March 11, price range $25,000-$120,000). The surreal and subversive Eindhoven artist defies traditional categories: “He is at once painterly and conceptual, an ultimate artist's artist,” says gallery owner Stuart Shave. Daniëls was previously represented by the New York gallery Metro Pictures, which closed in 2021, while Shave had a show of his paintings in London that year.</p> <p>Daniëls had institutional success early on and some of the works in Shave's forthcoming show were in the artist's first exhibition at Eindhoven's Van Abbemuseum in 1978. But Daniëls's career was stopped in its tracks in 1987 when he had a brain haemorrhage, aged only 37. “It would have been so interesting to see how he developed. But in 10 years, he had already achieved more than most people in a lifetime,” Shave says.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/1dba8a99-f8b3-4aad-8c07-4be0b9ae6cb2\"><em>The Art Market</em></a><em> column takes a seasonal break and will be back on January 14</em></p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter</em></p><p>Source: Melanie Gerlis 2022 '‘Glittering smokescreen' of auction highs masks a nervous market' FT.com 15 December.
