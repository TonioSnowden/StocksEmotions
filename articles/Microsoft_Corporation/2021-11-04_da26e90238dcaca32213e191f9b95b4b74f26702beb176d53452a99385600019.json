  "title": "Russia Analyst Igor Danchenko Charged in Connection With Steele Dossier; Special counsel John Durham, examining investigation of 2016 Trump campaign, says key source for British ex-spy Christopher Steele lied to FBI",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Danchenko has been charged with misleading FBI officials about the sources of the information he helped compile for Mr. Steele. Mr. Danchenko sat for numerous interviews with FBI officials in 2017 as they tried to corroborate allegations made in the reports compiled by Mr. Steele.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Danchenko had no immediate comment on the arrest.</p><p>The case represents the third prosecution related to the investigation, which began in May 2019 when then-Attorney General William Barr appointed Mr. Durham, then the Connecticut U.S. attorney, to look into matters related to the investigation into Mr. Trump and his campaign associates.</p><p>Mr. Danchenko has previously been identified as Mr. Steele's \"primary sub-source\" in compiling a series of private intelligence reports documenting Mr. Trump's purported ties to Russia. An FBI attorney who prepared a surveillance application as well as an attorney who specializes in cybersecurity have also been indicted by the special counsel's office on charges of making false statements.</p><p>Mr. Steele's research was paid for by the Democratic Party and served as key evidence in a secret surveillance warrant that was obtained against Carter Page, a onetime foreign-policy adviser to Mr. Trump. Many of the dossier's claims remain unverified. Mr. Trump has denied the allegations in the dossier and said the investigation it helped spark was a \"witch hunt.\"</p><p>Mr. Danchenko, born in Russia and trained as a lawyer there, has worked and studied in the U.S. since 2003, according to his LinkedIn profile. He holds masters degrees from Georgetown University and University of Louisville and has worked at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. More recently, he has worked as an independent risk analyst dealing with due-diligence and business-intelligence issues.</p><p>Aruna Viswanatha contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com</p><p>Russia Analyst Igor Danchenko Charged in Connection With Steele Dossier</p>",
