  "title": "Microsoft Hires Former Top Amazon Cloud Executive, Adding to Rivalry; Charlie Bell was previously a senior vice president at Amazon and top lieutenant to CEO Andy Jassy",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Bell spent more than two decades at AWS and was widely considered an heir apparent to Mr. Jassy. When Mr. Jassy was named to replace Jeff Bezos as Amazon's CEO, the company went outside for his replacement. In March, Amazon tapped Adam Selipsky to become the cloud business's next chief executive.</p><p>Mr. Selipsky also had a history at AWS and close ties to Mr. Jassy. He was one of the first vice presidents hired in 2005 to work at the cloud-computing business, remaining there for about 11 years and rising to run marketing, sales, support, business development, partner alliances and international expansion. He left in 2016 to become CEO of the data-analytics platform Tableau Software Inc., which was acquired by Salesforce.com Inc. for more than $15 billion, before his return to Amazon.</p><p>Mr. Bell's exact role at Microsoft couldn't immediately be determined. His move to Microsoft was previously reported by Business Insider.</p><p>Amazon and Microsoft are bitter rivals in cloud computing. Since Amazon set up AWS in 2006, the business has risen to a dominant position in the booming cloud-computing sector. Amazon held a 40.8% share of sales in the cloud market in 2020, according to Gartner Inc. Microsoft, the runner up, had a 19.7% share last year.</p><p>Microsoft has been attempting to catch up to Amazon through closer partnerships with other business software companies as well as acquisitions, such as its $16 billion deal earlier this year to buy voice recognition specialist Nuance Communications Inc.</p><p>The two compares have fought fiercely over contracts. When Microsoft won a Pentagon deal in 2019 to provide cloud-services to the U.S. military valued at up to $10 billion over 10 years, Amazon, the losing bidder, challenged the contract award. The Pentagon this year scrapped the program, known as JEDI, and said it would award multiple cloud contracts with the bidding open to qualified bidders, such as Microsoft and Amazon.</p><p>Amazon and Microsoft have been big beneficiaries of the pandemic-fueled wave of cloud-service adoptions across businesses. Microsoft last month posted record sales, driven by strong cloud revenue growth. Amazon, where the cloud-computing business generates the bulk of its operating profit, reported a 37% jump in AWS sales compared with a year earlier.</p><p>Write to Aaron Tilley at aaron.tilley@wsj.com</p><p>Microsoft Hires Former Top Amazon Cloud Executive, Adding to Rivalry</p>",
