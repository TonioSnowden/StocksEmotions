  "title": "H&M Closes Shanghai Flagship, Its First Store in China; Swedish fast-fashion brand was dealing with a Chinese boycottâ€”and then the two-month Covid-19 lockdown hit",
  "text": "<p>The closure is the latest sign of the deep scars that the two-month lockdown of Shanghai has left on China's economy and businesses. The restrictions kept most of Shanghai's 25 million residents at home, and shopping malls and nonessential stores were shut.</p><p>For H&amp;M, the Covid shutdown came on top of other challenges in China, the world's biggest consumer market. The brand became the target of a Chinese boycott in March 2021, months after it decided to stop sourcing from China's Xinjiang region because of forced-labor allegations there.</p><p>Any mention of the brand or its stores disappeared from most Chinese e-commerce sites and map apps. More than a year later, no results come up when the brand name is searched on some of those platforms.</p><p>An H&amp;M spokesperson declined to comment on the Shanghai store closure, saying the company is in a silent period ahead of its quarterly results announcement scheduled for Wednesday.</p><p>Last year, the consumer boycott led to landlords closing some outlets, and since then H&amp;M also has shut some bricks-and-mortar stores. H&amp;M currently has 362 stores in China, according to its customer-service representative, down from 445 in November 2021 and 505 a year earlier. H&amp;M currently has 26 stores in Shanghai, excluding the closed flagship store.</p><p>China, once H&amp;M's fourth-biggest market, dropped to its seventh in 2021 after the boycott.</p><p>Chinese retail sales, a gauge of consumer spending on goods and dining-out, declined 6.7% in May after slumping 11% in April, government data showed.</p><p>China's economic woes and strict Covid controls have added to headwinds for foreign companies. Meanwhile, Xinjiang has become a geopolitical flashpoint, with consequences for many multinationals. Human-rights groups and some governments allege that Chinese authorities are employing forced labor, including in cotton harvesting, among the Uyghurs, one of the country's Muslim minority groups, as well as among other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang.</p><p>China has denied using forced labor. Chinese authorities and state-controlled news outlets have attacked Western companies for highlighting forced-labor concerns in Xinjiang.</p><p>Last year, after the boycott, H&amp;M said it wanted to remain a \"responsible buyer\" in China.</p><p>Multinationals face other challenges such as tougher rules for businesses including in data collection and censorship practices.</p><p>This month, Amazon.com Inc. said it would close its Kindle digital bookstore in China in one year, and Nike Inc. said it would stop operating its Nike Run Club app in China in July. Airbnb Inc. plans to close its domestic business in China after Covid lockdowns compounded the pain from mounting local competition.</p><p>Last year, Microsoft Corp.'s LinkedIn shut down its social-media service in China, and Yahoo Inc. also pulled out of the country, both citing an increasingly challenging business and legal environment.</p><p>Write to Rachel Liang at rachel.liang@wsj.com and Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.com</p><p>H&amp;M Closes Shanghai Flagship, Its First Store in China</p>",
