  "text": "<p>   In the fall of 2017, Mr. Chen took a paid position to mentor students at a middle school in Chongqing, whose headmaster, Wu Xianhong, was the founder of investment company Verakin and had endowed a fellowship at MIT. Mr. Chen gave a speech there, encouraging students not to fear science. Mr. Wu's investment company advertised the affiliation, saying it offered a talent program that had \"famous experts and professors from top universities\" as tutors. Prosecutors said in the indictment that Mr. Chen hid that post from the U.S. as well. Lawyers for Mr. Chen have argued he was under no obligation to disclose it. </p><p>   In June 2018, MIT and SUSTech struck a deal under which SUSTech agreed to pay MIT $25 million over five years. SUSTech would send some faculty members and students to MIT each year, and MIT faculty members and students would travel to Shenzhen. That fall, Mr. Chen took a sabbatical from MIT and spent part of the semester at SUSTech. </p><p>   In 2019, Congress held a hearing in which U.S. national-security officials warned about scientific interactions with China. That April, MIT said it would intensify its vetting of projects that involved China, Russia or Saudi Arabia. Apparently, it didn't think its January 2020 visit to SUSTech -- which preceded Mr. Chen being questioned at the airport -- would present any problem. </p><p>   After Mr. Chen's arrest early this year, Mr. Reif, MIT's president, indicated that MIT and the government appeared to be construing the SUSTech collaboration very differently. \"These funds are about advancing the work of a group of colleagues, and the research and educational mission of MIT,\" he said. MIT has continued to pay Mr. Chen's legal bills. </p><p>   In a recent LinkedIn post, Mr. Lelling, the former Massachusetts U.S. attorney whose office charged Mr. Chen, said he thought the Justice Department should rethink its efforts to \"avoid needlessly chilling scientific and business collaborations with Chinese partners.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Lekai Liu contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
