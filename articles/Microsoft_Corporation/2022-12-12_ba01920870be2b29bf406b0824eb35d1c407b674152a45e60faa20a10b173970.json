  "text": "<p>Stronger-than-expected producer-price data prompted jitters about the inflation outlook last week, dragging all three indexes lower. Investors are hoping the economic outlook is more benign this week.</p><p>U.S. consumer-price index data is due Tuesday ahead of several central-bank meetings. The Fed is set to deliver its policy decision on rates as well as its latest economic projections Wednesday. Most investors expect the bank will raise its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, less than its three-quarter-point hike at its most recent meetings.</p><p>The European Central Bank and the Bank of England are due to meet and decide on interest rates Thursday.</p><p>Hopes that the Fed is winning the fight against inflation helped indexes to rally for most of November, sending the broad S&amp;P 500 to a three-month high. Data have shown, for the most part, signs that inflation is easing, raising expectations that Fed officials will begin to slow the pace of their interest-rate rises.</p><p>\"We think we've seen peak Fed and peak inflation,\" said Jason Ware, partner and chief investment officer for Albion Financial Group. \"We still have tightening to come, but most of it is behind us. We are much closer to the end than the beginning.\"</p><p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 3.611% from 3.567% on Friday. Yields on U.S. government bonds have fallen in recent weeks from the 14-year high they hit in October.</p><p>Slowing inflation and hopes for gentler Fed moves on interest rates, along with lingering fears about a recession, means the backdrop for bonds is unequivocally supportive, said Charles Diebel, head of fixed income at Mediolanum International Funds.</p><p>\"There's been a sea change in terms of the underlying sentiment and primarily that has been driven by the improvement in the CPI numbers turning south,\" said Mr. Diebel. \"Given how jumpy the market has been, a disappointment in the CPI reading will get a big negative reaction.\"</p><p>In commodity markets, the U.S. crude oil benchmark rose 3% to settle at $73.17 a barrel, bouncing back after six sessions of losses. Crude settled at its lowest level of the year on Friday.</p><p>The rebound boosted energy stocks. Shares of Valero Energy rose $6.01, or 5.2%, to $120.66, making it the S&amp;P 500's best performer on Monday. APA rose $2.05, or 4.9%, to $43.91. Schlumberger jumped $2.13, or 4.5%, to $49.10.</p><p>Tesla, one of the biggest decliners this year, shed $11.23, or 6.3%, to $167.82.</p><p>Overseas stock indexes fell across the board. Asian equities were led lower by Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, which tumbled 2.2%, and the Shanghai Composite Index, which fell 0.9%.</p><p>In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged down 0.5%. Shares of London Stock Exchange Group rose 3% after Microsoft agreed to take a 4% stake in the exchange operator.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com and Ben Eisen at ben.eisen@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Rallies More Than 500 Points With Inflation, Rate Outlook in Focus</p>",
