Energy ministers have finally agreed on a price cap on Russian exports of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b942b07-01cc-4e12-b803-7eb1507f6eec\">oil</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b2ffae4-04d1-4e09-89ce-b85f575d8422\">gas</a> but the EU energy regulator today expressed doubt that it would lead to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b6a9450-c121-4860-aff9-1e80b5372d00\">cheaper supplies</a> for business and consumers. </p> <p>Hopes for a swifter transition to more sustainable sources of energy have taken a knock in the process, with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/017c9e1e-3069-4bf3-8335-f1404abd6eb0\">global coal use</a> set to hit an all-time high. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c15dd27-9b7a-4905-aaa6-f6009b1aec50\">World oil markets</a> were also recast as western countries tried to limit Russia's revenues, one of many moves aimed at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c01e84b-5333-4024-aaf1-521cf1207eb4\">disrupting its economy</a>.</p> <p>The conflict wrecked supply chains, threatened <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e44db6b3-7266-4188-8d08-79d678a61146\">global food markets</a> and fuelled a global cost of living crisis. And although there are signs that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e71ef31-3b73-4f61-8272-cc1053e69b16\">headline inflation has peaked</a>, new FT analysis shows<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7354b85e-64b5-4cc5-bcf3-ee74fe6d4915\"> core inflation</a> in many countries continuing to rise.</p> <p>Containing this surge by raising interest rates has been the main preoccupation of the world's central banks this year. The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England last week began to slow the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ada57680-777e-4a5e-964b-caaa04f110ee\">pace of rises</a> but at the same time dented investor optimism with warnings that their policy tightening still had a way to go. The combination of higher borrowing costs, a strong dollar and the rise in inflation meanwhile has left many of the world's poorer countries with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/044b7e7d-84c7-4b9d-90e9-8b2449ae36f5\">serious debt problems</a>.</p> <p>How quickly central banks can get inflation under control and the outcome of the war will be the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/019fcc1b-83a1-4426-83d2-ef26e9ca5c9d\">defining factors of 2023</a>, says chief economics commentator Martin Wolf. As far as the conflict goes, Russian president Vladimir Putin hinted yesterday it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7815d37-97e4-4658-bed4-402b4811f012\">unlikely to be over anytime soon.</a></p> <p>In the meantime, many of the problems sparked by the pandemic are still with us, including labour shortages. The UK, still struggling with the consequences of leaving the EU (our film <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/91b8a350-5817-4b40-a5ea-c62ec832aa9c?playlist-name=editors-picks&amp;playlist-offset=8\"><em>The Brexit Effect</em></a> has now clocked up more than 5mn views), has in addition been hit by a rise in economic inactivity, interpreted by a parliamentary report this week as the “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b8604d4-44d7-4842-bd81-19554283bb69\">shape of things to come</a>”.</p> <p>Any hopes that the UK might chart a new confident course post-Brexit were dashed by a year of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/340d7380-6145-44ba-ac21-13c30fea4ec2\">political chaos</a>, with the country now headed by its third prime minister and fourth chancellor of the year. The ruling Tory party's reputation for economic management is in the dustbin after financial markets gave a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/736a695d-61f6-4e84-a567-fb92ed2a3dca\">huge thumbs down</a> to its economic plans while the country ends the year engulfed in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df1e0f5b-c0fe-4370-81c0-18734afa9391\">public sector strikes</a>.</p> <p>And as 2022 draws to a close we have another reminder that the pandemic is far from over. China has been hit by what it calls an “exit wave” of infections after abruptly abandoning its stringent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea00d39c-5ec4-49b9-be1f-83d370c1e5a7\">zero-Covid policies</a> that had so badly damaged its economy, with new data today laying bare the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1ed0fa4-bd8b-4c3f-9a54-b386d4fe0e14\">hit to its public finances</a>. The government promises “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9939220e-0d2c-4d43-8d62-03c7905e0123\">normalcy by spring</a>”.&#xa0; <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9591a4e-de33-4ef7-969f-1f57cbc13338\">Narrowing the definition</a> of Covid deaths is one way of doing it.</p> <p>And finally, lest we end on too depressing a note, Martin Wolf has also outlined a few <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dbe6533e-ab61-44bd-8866-fc59b6089cc7\">reasons to be cheerful</a>.</p> <p>“For those of us who believe in democracy, the rule of law, continued economic advance, global economic integration, sound financial markets and monetary stability, 2022 was not entirely bad,” he writes. “Yet let us hope that 2023 is better. It needs to be.” </p> <p><em>Disrupted Times is taking a festive break and will be back in your inbox on Wednesday January 4.
