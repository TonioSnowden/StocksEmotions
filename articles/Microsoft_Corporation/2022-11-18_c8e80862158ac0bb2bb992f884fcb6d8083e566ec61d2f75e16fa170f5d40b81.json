  "title": "Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani: Who Is the Former Theranos President and What Was He Convicted Of? The ex-boyfriend of Elizabeth Holmes, founder of the defunct blood-testing company, was found guilty on all 12 criminal-fraud charges in federal court",
  "text": "<p>A federal jury convicted Ramesh \"Sunny\" Balwani, the former top lieutenant to Theranos Inc. founder Elizabeth Holmes, on all 12 charges that he helped perpetuate a yearslong fraud scheme at defunct blood-testing startup Theranos Inc.</p><p>Mr. Balwani was on trial for more than three months in federal court in San Jose, Calif. Prosecutors argued that he defrauded Theranos investors and patients by lying about the capabilities of Theranos's finger-prick blood-testing technology.</p><p>Who is Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani and what does he have to do with Theranos?</p><p>Mr. Balwani, age 57, was the chief operating officer and president at Theranos, a blood-testing startup that claimed it could test for more than 200 health conditions using only a few drops of blood extracted from a finger prick. Mr. Balwani served in that role from 2009 to 2016, and he oversaw the company's lab and served as vice chairman of the board. He was the closest confidant of Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.</p><p>The theranos saga</p><p>* Early revelations</p><p>* An early Balwani profile</p><p>* Theranos coverage</p><p>* Elizabeth Holmes on trial</p><p>* A who's who</p><p>According to testimony from his trial, Mr. Balwani had enormous power and influence at Theranos. He made decisions about lab practices and policies, controlled who could access the lab, hired and fired employees, and was in charge of financial projections provided to investors. Former Theranos employees testified that Mr. Balwani and Ms. Holmes made decisions in unison about how to run the company.</p><p>Mr. Balwani and Ms. Holmes were more than colleagues—they were in a romantic relationship that spanned more than a decade, although they kept it secret from many employees, board directors and investors. Mr. Balwani joined Theranos in 2009, seven years after meeting Ms. Holmes, and the pair ran the company in tandem, through its rise to a company valued at more than $9 billion and its eventual downfall.</p><p>Theranos dissolved in September 2018.</p><p>How does this trial relate to the trial with Elizabeth Holmes?</p><p>The verdict is the second conviction against Theranos leadership and comes six months after a jury found Ms. Holmes guilty of fraud, securing another major victory for the U.S. government, which brought the case against the pair in 2018. A federal judge severed the case in March 2020, leading to separate trials with separate juries.</p><p>Mr. Balwani faced 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud related to deceiving patients who took Theranos blood tests and investors who put money into the company, according to the government's indictment. These are identical to the original charges Ms. Holmes faced, although near the conclusion of her trial one of the charges related to a Theranos patient was dropped because of an error by the prosecution.</p><p>Ms. Holmes was found guilty on Jan. 3 on four counts. She was acquitted on four charges and the jury hung on the remaining three counts. She is expected to be sentenced Nov. 18.</p><p>What possible punishment does Mr. Balwani face?</p><p>Mr. Balwani is set to be sentenced in December. He is out free on a $750,000 bond.</p><p>Each of the 12 counts against Mr. Balwani carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison plus fines and restitution. However, sentencing is a much more complex process, and judges have leeway; they must consider the sentencing guidelines but can use their own discretion. Recent sentences imposed on high-profile white-collar crimes have been far less than the maximum allowed.</p><p>Sentencing guidelines for white-collar offenders hinge largely on the amount of money alleged to have been lost in a fraud scheme, but the judge can consider a range of other factors, such as the number of victims affected.</p><p>What did Mr. Balwani do before Theranos?</p><p>An immigrant from a long line of farmers, Mr. Balwani studied information systems at the University of Texas, graduating in 1990, and got a master's degree in business administration in 2003 from the University of California, Berkeley, his lawyer said.</p><p>Mr. Balwani is a veteran tech executive who worked in software, including at Lotus and Microsoft, but much of his wealth derived from work at an earlier startup. In the dot-com boom, he helped run e-commerce startup CommerceBid.com, which was acquired in 1999 for roughly $228 million in cash and stock. Mr. Balwani received shares as part of the deal that he sold for more than $40 million, based on a lawsuit he later filed against a tax adviser.</p><p>He used his own money as collateral when he guaranteed a $12 million loan to Theranos in 2009, and he later invested in the company. </p><p>Elizabeth Holmes left court after the verdict was delivered in her trial in San Jose, Calif., in January.

He didn't have experience in pathology or laboratory science before running Theranos's lab, prosecutors have said.</p><p>His ex-wife, Japanese artist Keiko Fujimoto, divorced him in 2002 in San Francisco Superior Court, the same year he met Ms. Holmes.</p><p>What was the relationship between Mr. Balwani and Ms. Holmes?</p><p>Ms. Holmes and Mr. Balwani had a secret romance as well as a professional alliance. They met in 2002, when Ms. Holmes was still a teenager and Mr. Balwani was 37, while in China as part of a language immersion program, according to Ms. Holmes's lawyer. Mr. Balwani later supported Ms. Holmes's decision to drop out of Stanford University and start the company that would become Theranos, Ms. Holmes testified in her trial.</p><p>They lived together from 2005 to 2016, at one point buying a house in Atherton, Calif., a tony Silicon Valley enclave, for $9 million, according to evidence presented in Ms. Holmes's trial.</p><p>The couple split in 2016, around the time Mr. Balwani left Theranos. After they broke up, he sometimes would show up at the church Ms. Holmes attended at night or at the place where she used to go running at Stanford University, she testified.</p><p>What did Ms. Holmes say about Mr. Balwani in her trial?</p><p>In the most gripping testimony from Ms. Holmes, she accused Mr. Balwani of emotionally, psychologically and sexually abusing her for years, alleging that he controlled what she ate, how much to sleep, and when she could spend time with her family and friends. She described a relationship in which she was pressured to live up to his exacting standards and was punished when she failed. She testified that at times Mr. Balwani forced her to have sex.</p><p>A lawyer for Mr. Balwani denied all allegations of abuse.</p><p>Ms. Holmes read text messages aloud in court that she had exchanged with Mr. Balwani, in which they expressed feelings of love and devotion to each other. She called him \"My nirvana,\" according to the messages, and he told her, \"I worship you.\"</p><p>The story ILLUSTRATED</p><p>* The Testimony of Elizabeth Holmes: Regret, Revelations and Deflections</p><p>Ms. Holmes testified that Mr. Balwani was in charge of the lab and had assured her that everything was in order, and she was stunned when a regulatory inspection found numerous deficiencies—contradicting evidence from the prosecution that Mr. Balwani had warned her that the lab was a \"disaster zone.\" Ms. Holmes also testified that she was ultimately responsible as CEO, and Mr. Balwani didn't control what she said to investors, business partners, board members or journalists.</p><p>What did Mr. Balwani say during his trial?</p><p>Mr. Balwani didn't testify in his trial. Ms. Holmes's allegations of abuse did not resurface in his trial, and she wasn't called as a witness.</p><p>Mr. Balwani showed no emotion as the verdict was read, and looked periodically at his lawyer. He said nothing as he left the courthouse walking alongside his lawyers and trailed by family members.</p><p>Jeffrey Coopersmith, Mr. Balwani's lawyer, said: \"We are obviously disappointed with the verdicts. We plan to study and consider all of Mr. Balwani's options, including an appeal.\"</p><p>This article may be updated.</p><p>Write to Heather Somerville at heather.somerville@wsj.com</p><p>Ramesh 'Sunny' Balwani: Who Is the Former Theranos President and What Was He Convicted Of?</p>",
