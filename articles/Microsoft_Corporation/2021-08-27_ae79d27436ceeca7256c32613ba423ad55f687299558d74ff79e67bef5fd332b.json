  "text": "<h2>J Sainsbury: word of mouth</h2> <p>Will the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c55630f-9a8e-447c-8b8f-dabb11c72983\">bid battle for Wm Morrison</a> turn into a private equity supermarket sweep? Investors seem confident. J Sainsbury surged this week to a multiyear high. So did Marks and Spencer, whose 33 per cent surge through August can only be explained partly by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/637ddeaf-9240-4811-8965-2ea3c0ee318e\">improved trading</a>. </p> <p>“We do not believe it is fanciful to speculate that there will be no listed UK supermarkets in due course,” said analyst Clive Black of Shore Capital, Morrison's house broker.</p> <p>Yet Black gave short shrift to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bidders-train-guns-on-sainsburys-sh8228nst\">a report</a> that Apollo Global has been weighing up an approach to Sainsbury, calling the tale “not only sensationalist but quite shallow”. Sainsbury shares had surged by as much as 15 per cent on Monday, in spite of silence from both parties and a virtue-signalling insider purchase: Adrian Hennah last week bought 15,000 shares at 290p apiece, his first trade since joining Sainsbury's board as a non-executive director in April. </p> <p>Other analysts were more circumspect. Sainsbury's house broker UBS stuck with a “buy” recommendation even after Sainsbury surged well above a 300p price target on the back of Apollo's purported interest, briefly hitting a high of 340p. A leveraged buyout still makes sense at current levels and the grocer's biggest shareholders, Qatar Investment Authority and Czech investor Daniel Kretinsky, are financially motivated so might welcome an exit, it said.</p> <p>Sellside research will only ever give a partial view into the cliquey world of UK food retail. For its Morrison bid approach Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice is using PR firm Teneo. The PR spinner's deal team includes recent recruit Claire Scicluna, daughter of Sainsbury chair Martin Scicluna, and Philip Gawith, who is the market's first point of contact for longstanding Teneo client Tesco.</p> <h2>Marco Gobbetti: checking out</h2> <p>Burberry chief executive Marco Gobbetti is working out his notice period having in June <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94d097cf-a1e0-4089-9489-a9b8424b63a1\">quit the fashion label</a> to join Italian rival Salvatore Ferragamo. But what shape will his new employer be in by the time he joins? According to gossip around the Milan market, the Ferragamo family has been fielding fresh interest from potential buyers of its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb252fe6-9654-4206-a6d2-5ae9ad8af353\">majority stake</a> in the business. </p> <h2>Kingdom of Sweets: candy crush</h2> <p>Visitors to any UK city centre cannot have failed to spot a recent trend in high street retail: sweet shops selling imported and retro packaged American candy at ambitious prices. Oxford Street in London has at least a dozen lookalike stores in the one mile stretch between Marble Arch and Tottenham Court Road. </p> <p>The craze this week caught the attention of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/american-candy-taking-london-storm-n1277223\">US network NBC News</a>, which blamed borrowed nostalgia and TikTok challenges for the “sweet American invasion”. </p> <p>Press coverage is bringing unwelcomed attention to Kingdom of Sweets, the privately owned group that claims to have invented the niche. Founded by Chase Manders in 2004 from a <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/london/shopping/why-is-central-london-suddenly-full-of-american-sweetshops\">shopping centre stall in Barnsley</a>, Kingdom of Sweets has established itself as an anchor tenant for landlords including Criterion Capital, owner of the Trocadero Centre in London, and Addington Capital, which owns Queens Arcade in Cardiff. </p> <p>What looks less tasty is the complicated corporate structure underpinning the business. </p> <p>Manders is owner and sole director of UK-registered <a href=\"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/11004735\">Kingdom of Sweets Ltd</a>, which he formed in 2017 a year after its namesake <a href=\"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/07531316\">Kingdom of Sweets Limited</a> was dissolved by voluntary strike-off. The latter never filed accounts with Companies House and the former is registered as a dormant company. Two associated vehicles, <a href=\"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/08727436\">Croftray</a> and <a href=\"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/08785140\">Oldgreen</a>, are both going through <a href=\"https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/3559347\">compulsory</a> <a href=\"https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/3393896\">liquidations</a>. <a href=\"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/07602161\">Grangeway Capital 1</a> and <a href=\"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/08465814/officers\">2</a>, also controlled by Manders, were liquidated in 2018 and 2016 respectively. </p> <p>Kingdom of Sweets finance director Jason Graham identifies <a href=\"https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/07166057\">Fordgreen</a> on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasongraham/?originalSubdomain=uk\">his LinkedIn profile</a> as the successor operating company to Croftray. But its last 10 sets of accounts up to February 2020 have been as a dormant company. Graham did not respond to questions about the business. Neither did Alan Wiggett, Kingdom of Sweets managing director, who blocked City Insider from viewing his LinkedIn profile.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Brokers remain bullish as takeover speculation lifts Sainsbury ' FT.com 27 August.
