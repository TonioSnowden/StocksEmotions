  "title": "Extravagant Company Retreats Are Making a Comeback; As more employees work remotely, companies are hoping lavish meetings will engage workers and make them more likely to stay",
  "text": "<p>\"Onboarding is nearly impossible to replicate remotely,\" says Corinne Jones, president of CJC Human Resources Services in New York. \"You can't establish touch points in an organization or make new employees feel entrenched with their co-workers, and we've seen that loyalty diminishes without face-to-face engagement.\"</p><p>Ms. Jones says that companies haven't been able to gather like this in some time and many are willing to spend the money to do it in an over-the-top way. \"We're seeing soaring turnover rates, and competent talent is extremely difficult to find,\" she says. \"From a trend standpoint, these trips are seen as perks for employees.\"</p><p>Fun, fun, fun</p><p>In March, data-integration company Matillion flew almost 200 employees for a \"Super All Hands\" near its global headquarters in Manchester, U.K. The agenda included the typical town hall meeting with the executive team and small breakout workshops. But there were also unusual guest speakers, including an astronaut and Olympic rower, and a fun fair complete with rides, stilt walkers, an ice-cream stand, street-food stalls and games like ring toss.</p><p>Kelley Yoshihara, a Denver-based commercial-account executive hired right out of college who had never met the majority of her co-workers, found herself convincing Matillion's vice president of sales to join her on the Waltzer, a dizzying car-spinning ride. \"I could tell he was nervous,\" says Ms. Yoshihara. \"When do you ever see a V.P. in that situation? His vulnerability made him feel relatable.\"</p><p>Even more exciting than the Waltzer, which she rode 19 times, was the company's willingness to allow employees to tack on vacation after the retreat. Ms. Yoshihara, who had never been outside the U.S., took advantage of the opportunity and spent a week traveling around Europe.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What kinds of corporate retreats are most useful? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"After being locked down for two years, we needed a big morale boost for the company,\" says Vicki Marchington, Matillion's vice president of people. Positive employee reviews on LinkedIn were a testament to the event's success. One said: \"When was the last time your place of work threw an actual fun fair?!\"</p><p>Bonding experiences are also crucial for Embark Beyond, a luxury travel agency that has expanded to 150-plus mostly remote employees from just 20 in 2019. \"Corporate culture and community used to be cultivated in the coffee room, at the water cooler or during the holiday party,\" says Jack Ezon, co-founder of the New York-based company.</p><p>In November, Mr. Ezon will host the company's first-ever retreat at Baha Mar, a 1,000-acre resort in the Bahamas. Not only do retreats build bonds among employees, he says, but they can also be a nice perk for workers who might be inclined to jump ship. \"A lot of people stay because of how they feel about their workplace,\" says Mr. Ezon.</p><p>Graeme Davis, president of Baha Mar, says corporate-retreat business is on pace to exceed the company's previous high for group business in 2019 by 60%. Based on its current booking pace, the company anticipates group business in 2023 to exceed 2022 by as much as 25%. And companies are bringing more people than they used to. \"If a company booked 30 rooms in 2019, they now want 60,\" he says. \"If it was 250 in 2019, now it's 500.\"</p><p>Opening up</p><p>Lauren Payne has been planning executive-level off-site events for WCM Investment Management, Laguna Beach, Calif., for nearly a decade. But 2021 was the first year she was asked to facilitate a retreat for all 80 employees, she says, rather than just the leadership team and a few others. The firm has hired aggressively in the past two years, and this was a way for newcomers to really get into the fabric of the company, says Ms. Payne.</p><p>She organized a propertywide buyout of the Ranch at Rock Creek, a ritzy Montana dude ranch, the past two years. The agenda was all fun.</p><p>Employees divided into teams for a ranch olympics with challenges like capture the flag, paintball and roping dummy cattle. Ms. Payne, who was in attendance, says you could sense new hires hesitate when they were faced with an opportunity to shoot the CEO with a foam-tipped arrow during archery tag. Seeing executives taking aim, they all shot back.</p><p>\"You can tell someone your company isn't hierarchical, but this was a chance for people to experience it and literally sit down to dinner with our leadership,\" she says.</p><p>The great outdoors</p><p>Still, there will always be plenty of workers who recoil at getting together with colleagues and participating in bonding exercises. What's more, Covid continues to make some employees wary of large gatherings, even when masks, daily testing and colored bracelets denoting social-distancing preferences are offered. Of the 495 employees invited to Matillion's March event, 426 attended. The majority who stayed home did so because of Covid concerns, according to Ms. Marchington. To ensure no one felt excluded, the event was livestreamed and executives fielded questions via Slack.</p><p>Other companies are choosing wilderness settings that lend themselves to social distancing as well as adventurous bonding activities.</p><p>This May, Butchershop, a brand-strategy agency, held its second companywide summit in Costa Rica. During the pandemic, the company grew to 150 employees, most of whom work remotely, from 30, and Butchershop closed its large Bay Area office. According to CEO Trevor Hubbard, 85% of employees said they would rather have a hybrid-remote company plus an annual trip than a traditional office.</p><p>In Costa Rica, activities like ziplining were interspersed with daily departmental workshops. \"On retreats, I like to get people on adventures that push and make us a little uncomfortable,\" says Mr. Hubbard. \"That creates a deep bonding experience which encourages us to be more comfortable taking risks in our work.\"</p><p>During a horseback ride through the jungle with 30 new hires and junior designers, he cooled off by jumping from a jungle cliff into a watering hole, urging others to join him. (Some did.)</p><p>One month into his job at software company Sanity, Jon Weekly, a senior customer-service manager, found himself connecting with colleagues over scavenger hunts, go-kart races, and mountain-bike excursions at a mountain resort in Norway. Since 2020, the startup has grown to just over 100 employees spread across Europe, the U.S. and Canada from 22 people in its Oslo office. With 90% attendance at the event, it was the first opportunity for most employees, including Mr. Weekly, who is based in San Francisco, to meet face to face.</p><p>\"My wife was jealous, but we had fully structured days,\" says Mr. Weekly. \"And it was mentally exhausting to be so social again.\" Team-building activities ranged from performing skits where groups of employees explained Sanity's products to made-up audiences—including pretending they were talking to celebs like Oprah Winfrey—to partaking in quirky games like boot throwing.</p><p>\"Until then, my co-workers were boxes on screens,\" says Mr. Weekly. \"We got to know each other on a real human level.\"</p><p>Ms. Murphy is a writer who lives in Maui and Colorado.
