  "text": "<p>The e-commerce giant jolted investors with its projection for revenue of $140 billion to $148 billion in the current period -- analysts had expected more than $155 billion, according to FactSet. Amazon, which said the estimate includes a sizable hit from foreign-exchange factors, also said it anticipated operating income of anywhere between zero and $4 billion, reflecting the uncertainty looming over what is traditionally its biggest quarter of the year because of holiday shopping.</p><p>The company's shares fell about 12% in after-hours trading following the results to trade near $97. At that level Amazon's valuation is below $1 trillion, which it first hit in 2018.</p><p>The disappointing outlook capped an extraordinary several days that also saw shares plunge in other tech giants after their results showed worsening conditions in a range of areas.</p><p>Shares in Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., already battered over the past year, dropped nearly 25% on Thursday after it reported its second revenue decline in a row a day earlier. Microsoft Corp.'s stock also fell after it delivered on Tuesday its worst net income decline in more than two years and the weakest revenue growth in over five years. Google parent Alphabet Inc. similarly disappointed investors with slowing sales.</p><p>These tech companies flourished during the pandemic, as life and work suddenly shifted more to the internet, pushing up sales and spurring the already fast-growing companies to accelerate hiring and investment.</p><p>Now, one after another, engines that drove that growth are sputtering. Sales of personal computers and other gadgets are falling and consumers, walloped by inflation, are broadly trimming their spending. Companies are tightening their outlays on everything from digital ads to IT services.</p><p>\"There is obviously a lot happening in the macroeconomic environment, and we'll balance our investments to be more streamlined without compromising our key long-term, strategic bets,\" Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy said Thursday.</p><p>In the third quarter, Amazon's online store sales rose 7% to $53.48 billion after falling in recent quarters. The segment includes product sales primarily on its flagship site and digital media content. Its online sales got a boost from its annual Prime Day sale, which this year fell in the third quarter; last year it was in the second quarter.</p><p>While still the nation's largest online store, Amazon's e-commerce division has struggled to grow this year. The company in the second quarter reported a 4% year-over-year drop in its online stores segment. That marked the largest drop since the metric was first disclosed in 2016.</p><p>This year, Amazon's e-commerce machine -- which has grown at breakneck speed for decades -- has been showing signs that it could be entering a phase of slower growth. After a multibillion-dollar infrastructure build-out and hiring spree, it now has to contend with high inflation and concerns about a recession weighing on consumer spending.</p><p>Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said Thursday that the company has entered a period of caution.</p><p>\"We are preparing for what could be a slower growth period like most companies. We are going to be very careful on our hiring,\" Mr. Olsavsky said. \"We certainly are looking at our cost structure and looking for areas where we can save money.\"</p><p>He said Amazon is \"seeing signs all around that people's budgets are tight, inflation is still high.\"</p><p>Analysts said the challenges Amazon faces in e-commerce could linger.</p><p>Amazon has the largest share of online commerce, about 38%, but its market share has plateaued in recent years, according to research firm Insider Intelligence. Analysts said the company size has made it unlikely for the e-commerce unit to grow at the same rate it once did. Amazon is also dealing with increased competition from Walmart Inc., Target Corp. and others.</p><p>Mr. Jassy has shifted toward cost-cutting. The company cut back on subleasing millions of square feet of excess warehouse space and putting off openings of new facilities while earlier thinning out its hourly workforce through attrition.</p><p>The company enacted a hiring freeze through the end of the year at its corporate retail division, the segment that drives its core sales and is responsible for a large part of its slowdown this year. It has also paused hiring among some teams at its Amazon Web Services cloud-computing division.</p><p>While Amazon's earnings continue to be aided by Amazon Web Services and its expanding advertising business, growth slowed in the cloud business. AWS had sales of $20.5 billion in the third quarter, a 27% rise but one of the lowest rates of growth the unit has had in recent quarters.</p><p>Amazon's advertising revenues rose 25% to $9.5 billion.</p><p>The company heads toward the end of the year with added problems. After needing fewer blue-collar employees earlier in the year, it has looked to add over 100,000 hourly workers at its warehouses to meet the expected holiday season demand. Still, that strategy has come with a cost. Amazon recently said it would spend $1 billion to raise average starting salaries to $19 an hour nationwide.</p><p>Amazon's own Jeff Bezos recently said it is time to \"batten down the hatches,\" referring to warning signs of a recession.</p>",
