  "text": "<p>   Government authorities worldwide are tackling the problem with new regulations. The Federal Communications Commission in September proposed new rules that would limit the lifespan of low-Earth orbit satellites to five years, after which they must drift or move themselves into a controlled burn-up in the atmosphere. Earlier, ad hoc rules set no common limits for the satellites. </p><p>   \"Given an unlimited time, there will be a lot of satellites -- as long as we don't turn space into an asteroid belt,\" says Greg Wyler, a longtime satellite-industry executive who now leads a startup called E-Space. </p><p>   The history of the satellite business is littered with high-cost financial failures. Teledesic, a satellite constellation backed by Bill Gates and telecom entrepreneur Craig McCaw, collapsed after then-partner Motorolapulled out of the project in 1999. TerreStar, another satellite-internet startup, filed for bankruptcy protection in 2010 and was later swallowed by TV company Dish Network Corp. Iridium and Globalstar's networks both avoided liquidation only after the companies trimmed their debt loads through the bankruptcy process. </p><p>   They also depend heavily on revenue from the U.S. military and other government customers to keep the lights on. </p><p>   Deeper-pocketed Amazon.com Inc. has said its planned 3,200-satellite network, will cost more than $10 billion to start. And Mr. Musk has said SpaceX, which pioneered the business of low-cost launches partly with help from government contracts, will need to lower the cost of sending payloads aloft even further for Starlink to become cash-flow positive. </p><p>   SpaceX, formally called Space Exploration Technologies Inc., already generates revenue providing broadband to homes, businesses and other users with a satellite dish for monthly rates of $110 or more. Expanding that business to phones, cars and other moving targets costs more to maintain and could generate less revenue per user, though it would serve a bigger pool of potential customers. </p><p>   \"What are you going to charge them for it if you're spending $10 billion to provide it?\" Iridium's Mr. Desch says. \"There are a lot of people thinking about how to best price this.\" </p><p>   Iridium doesn't have to solve the pricing problem because its partners will offer the mobile service, Mr. Desch says. Several industry executives say future satellite service could come as an add-on subscription that smartphone makers or cellphone carriers charge. </p><p>   More-bullish market analyst New Street Research estimated that a truly \"seamless\" satellite-to-phone service with voice and data would be worth as much as $20 billion a year in the U.S. and many times that around the world. Recent interest from SpaceX and Apple shows the market's promise, the firm wrote in a recent note to clients. </p><p>   \"With Apple joining the fray,\" the firm said, \"two trillion dollar companies would now seem to agree that the opportunity could be massive.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Micah Maidenberg contributed to this article. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Mr. FitzGerald is a Wall Street Journal reporter in Washington, D.C.
