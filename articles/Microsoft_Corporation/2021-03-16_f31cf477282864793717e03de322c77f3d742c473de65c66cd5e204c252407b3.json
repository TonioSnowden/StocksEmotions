  "text": "<p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6d578c4-9a57-4375-b7b2-c88d4b7cc21f\">Greensill Capital</a> provided financing to Sanjeev Gupta's business empire based on invoices from ostensibly independent companies with links to the steel magnate, raising new questions about the quality of the collateral underpinning billions of dollars of loans.</p> <p>Gupta's sprawling <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fedcf26c-4313-4649-b628-9a2884b3e43e\">GFG Alliance</a> metals conglomerate, which includes Britain's third-largest steel producer and numerous plants in Europe and Australia, has been rocked by the collapse of Greensill, which had $5bn of exposure to the industrialist's businesses.</p> <p>Documents seen by the Financial Times show that Greensill — which specialised in arranging corporate funding linked to invoices and fell into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db5bc46a-57cc-4c7d-a6fe-47f5a59412d4\">administration</a> last week — financed several transactions between Gupta's businesses and a series of linked companies. </p> <p>Some of the metals magnate's employees called these entities the “Friends of Sanjeev”, the FT has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f3bde1e-4e4f-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5\">previously reported</a>, because of their ties to his business empire.</p> <p>It is unclear if employees monitoring the transactions were aware of the longstanding links between the nominally independent companies and Gupta's businesses. Greensill had a strict policy against financing trades between related parties, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>The deals, some of which took place as recently as last year, provided funding to both Gupta's industrial and commodities trading arms. Greensill packaged at least one of the transactions up into investment products sold to funds at Credit Suisse.&#xa0;</p> <p>Most large financial institutions have policies to prevent them from financing invoices between so-called “related parties” because they are more prone to fraud than transactions between independent companies. There is no evidence that the transactions in question were illegitimate, however.</p> <p>Greensill Capital and Gupta's GFG Alliance declined to comment.</p> <p>One of the trades Greensill financed was a $1.7m transaction between Gupta's Liberty Commodities and Aar Tee Commodities, a trading business named for the initials of its founder Ravi Trehan, who has deep ties to Gupta.</p> <p>Trehan was on the board of GFG's charitable foundation. He was previously listed as one of the four members of the GFG Alliance's strategic board. In this role, he attended a lobbying dinner Gupta hosted with members of the Scottish government in 2016. Trehan told the FT last year that his AarTee group was “independent” from GFG, however.</p> <p>The $1.7m trade was packaged into an investment vehicle at Credit Suisse last year, one of a $10bn range of funds linked to Greensill that the Swiss bank froze earlier this month.</p> <p>Other documents show that Gupta's metals plants have engaged in similar trades via Greensill. A spreadsheet produced by Greensill in 2018 shows that several invoices from entities with links to Gupta were pledged as part of a receivables financing line to Gupta's UK steel business.</p> <p>Sterling Resources International, for example, placed a £4.5m order for steel that was financed by Greensill that year. Sterling's owner Sunil Pasi worked at Liberty Commodities for 14 years, according to his LinkedIn account. </p> <p>VS International placed an identically-sized order that was financed by Greensill. The company was founded by Vikrant Sharma, whose LinkedIn describes him as president at Gupta's Liberty Steel Holdings USA, who then sold the company in 2017.</p> <p>Sterling and VS were subsequently removed from Greensill's approved customer list because of their links to Gupta, according to a person familiar with the matter. </p> <p>The FT reported last year that Aar Tee was one of several Gupta-linked companies that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c12a439-4bfd-4cce-bf74-4bd7d7ffe238\">drew government-backed loans</a> from Greensill. The finance company advanced hundreds of millions of pounds to companies linked to the steel magnate under a coronavirus lending programme, with officials now scrambling to assess whether the government has to stand behind the loans.</p> <p>Sterling and VS both previously borrowed from Wyelands Bank, Gupta's UK lender that regulators ordered to return depositors' money earlier this month. The FT revealed last year that the bank had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a591c986-5983-11ea-abe5-8e03987b7b20\">drawn regulatory</a> scrutiny because it had funded Gupta's wider business empire through the so-called “Friends of Sanjeev”.</p> <p>Pasi told the FT that Sterling had not done transactions through Wyelands and Greensill for a long time, while adding that his business was independent from GFG. “If I get some business through my old contacts, there's no harm in that,” he said.</p> <p>VS's present owner Christian Favre did not respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Sterling, VS and Aar Tee also all had their 2019 accounts audited by the same small accountancy firm, a London-based auditor called King &amp; King that has signed off on the accounts for scores of Gupta-linked companies.</p><p>Source: Robert Smith, Michael Pooler and Cynthia O’Murchu 2021 'Greensill financed Gupta based on invoices from ‘friends of Sanjeev'' FT.com 16 March.
