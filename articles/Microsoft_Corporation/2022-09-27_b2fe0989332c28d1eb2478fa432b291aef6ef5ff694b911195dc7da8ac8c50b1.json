  "text": "<p>Rounding out this year's top-10 list are plenty of familiar names, including Bill Gates (No. 3, $106 billion); Larry Ellison (No. 4, $101 billion); and Warren Buffett (No. 5, $97 billion).</p><p>But this year's ranking was noteworthy for one individual who didn't make it to the top 10 — namely, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta META, who fell to the 11th spot with a mere $57.7 billion.</p><p>Musk's wealth also puts him at the top of Forbes' real-time ranking of global billionaires. That list includes several individuals from outside the U.S., such as France's Bernard Arnault and India's Gautam Adani.</p><p>Apparently, the tough economy is leaving even the wealthiest Americans feeling slightly less wealthy. Forbes noted that the combined net worth of the top 400 totaled $4 trillion — or $500 billion less than in 2021. \"The rich don't always get richer,\" Forbes said.</p><p>The highest newcomer on the 400 list? Oil tycoon Autry Stephens, whose $10 billion in wealth put him 64th in the ranking.</p><p>Also of note: Former President Donald Trump rejoined the list after failing to make the cut last year. He ranked 343 with a net worth of $3.2 billion.</p><p>Elon Musk tops Forbes list of 400 richest Americans</p>",
