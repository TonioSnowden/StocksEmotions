U.S. stocks had rallied for three straight sessions before Wednesday's wipeout, which was the worst post-election day performance for the major U.S. indexes on a percentage-point basis since 2012.</p><p>\"What's important about all this is we had some very important events this week and both played out in a favorable way for markets,\" Hogan added, a reference to both the inflation data and the expectation that Republicans will control the House once all the votes are tallied from Tuesday's midterms.</p><p>Shortly after the data were released, the Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos reportedthat the October report \"is likely to keep the Fed on track to approve a 50-basis-point interest-rate increase next month.\"</p><p>Fed funds futures traders were pricing in higher than 80% of a 50 basis point rate hike in December, compared with below 60% odds one day earlier, compared with the CME's FedWatch tool.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y retreated below 4%, helping to drive stocks higher, falling 30 basis points to 3.849%, on track for its biggest daily drop since March 18, 2009, according to DJMD.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY was off 2% at 108.35in recent trade as the euro rose to its highest level against the buck in roughly two months.
