Take our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2021-02-19/\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Vlad Tenev, the chief executive of controversial trading app Robinhood, was the main target for lawmakers' ire as he appeared before the Congressional committee investigating the furore surrounding last month's trading of GameStop shares.</p> <p>Tenev told the House Committee on Financial Services on Thursday that the trading platform would not have been immediately able to meet a $3bn capital call from its equity clearinghouse on January 28. The admission appeared to contradict earlier comments he had made that the company did not have a liquidity issue. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69c0b5b0-9d49-4d0e-8f32-fe9428bff5b1\">He apologised</a> for the events surrounding Robinhood's suspension of trading in what he called a “black swan” event.</p> <p>Lawmakers returned throughout the hearing to the practice of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6651f34a-0d8d-4d68-bdf9-23b355f8c9db\">payment for order flow</a>, under which market makers such as Citadel Securities pay retail brokers to execute their customers' trades.</p> <p>Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel Securities, defended the practice, saying payment for order flow was an “important source of innovation in the industry” in the drive towards zero-commission trading. </p> <p>He also adamantly denied that his company and Robinhood had co-ordinated when the app limited trading in GameStop and other heavily shorted stocks. “Let me be perfectly clear, absolutely not,” Griffin said.
