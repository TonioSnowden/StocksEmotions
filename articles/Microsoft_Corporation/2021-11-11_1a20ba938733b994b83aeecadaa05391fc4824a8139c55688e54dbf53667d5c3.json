As for why they sold, she said, \"they had it for 30 years. They were ready to let it go.\" The couple also own a home in Atherton, Calif., records show. David Richardson of the brokerage Hawaii Life represented the buyer, who he declined to name. The Lamonds didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In Hawaii, the Lamonds purchased the first parcel, on roughly half an acre, for $1.5 million in 1989, records show. Ms. Callahan said the couple built a roughly 4,000-square-foot house on the parcel. In 2008, they paid $10 million for an adjacent house, records show.</p><p>Mr. Richardson said his buyer got a \"wholesale price\" for purchasing the two parcels together, but doesn't need two houses and may sell one of them. \"Right now, there's hardly any product on the market,\" he said.</p><p>Since July, two other recorded sales in Hawaii have topped $40 million. On Maui, San Francisco investment banker Thomas Weisel sold an oceanfront mansion for $45 million in July.
