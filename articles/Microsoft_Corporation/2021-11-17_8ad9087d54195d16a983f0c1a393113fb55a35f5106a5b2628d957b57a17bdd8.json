  "title": "Staples Center in L.A. to Be Renamed Crypto.com Arena; Sponsorship deal at home of Lakers and LeBron James is cryptocurrency industry's latest move to gain mainstream recognition",
  "text": "<p>In addition to the National Basketball Association's Lakers, the Staples Center is home to the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers and the National Hockey League's Los Angeles Kings. The 20,000-seat arena is a hub for concerts and a venue for Hollywood stars to be seen both as performers and courtside spectators.</p><p>Crypto.com was founded in 2016 and has more than 2,600 employees, according to its website. It offers cryptocurrency trading, and lets users borrow as much as 10 times their capital to invest in digital currencies. It also provides cryptocurrency-based credit cards and other digital assets, such as nonfungible tokens.</p><p>The deal is the latest attempt by the upstart cryptocurrency industry to gain mainstream recognition. Digital currencies and tokens are held by a rising number of institutional investors and retail traders. The U.S. financial regulator approved the launch of the first exchange-traded fund that holds bitcoin futures contracts last month.</p><p>Other cryptocurrency companies have also targeted sports as a place to introduce themselves to the wider public. The U.S. affiliate of crypto exchange FTX forged a naming-rights deal valued at $135 million for the arena where the NBA's Miami Heat play. It also backed a $20 million advertising campaign featuring football star Tom Brady and his wife, model and businesswoman Gisele BÃ¼ndchen.</p><p>The Crypto.com price tag appeared to put it in another league. \"This is certainly one of the largest deals I've ever heard of,\" said Irwin Kishner, a lawyer with a focus on sports law at Herrick Feinstein LLP. \"It's absolutely a ground-shaking, major transaction.\"</p><p>Crypto.com allows its users to trade popular cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, as well as lesser-known ones. It is run by Chief Executive Kris Marszalek, a Polish-born and Hong Kong-based entrepreneur. He founded two e-commerce companies, a mobile app and a consumer-electronics business before stepping into the cryptocurrency industry, according to his LinkedIn profile.</p><p>\"If you want to reach several billions of people, sports is the way to go,\" said Mr. Marszalek in an interview. \"Our objective is to be, in the next three to five years, one of the top 20 consumer brands alongside Nike or Apple.\"</p><p>The company has been on a public-relations push. It hired actor Matt Damon to appear in a commercial in October, adding him to the list of celebrities who have endorsed digital assets, such as Kim Kardashian, Snoop Dogg and Paris Hilton. The ad's tag line was the Latin proverb \"fortune favours the brave.\"</p><p>In 2020, Crypto.com had to halt its credit-card programs in the U.K. and Europe and reimburse users when German payments company Wirecard entered bankruptcy because of an accounting scandal. Crypto.com had relied on Wirecard to issue the cards.</p><p>Companies use stadium and arena branding deals to raise their profile. The agreements provide lucrative long-term income to the stadium owners and teams and expose the companies' brands over television broadcasts and through the media.</p><p>Occasionally, stadium branding deals turn sour. In 2002, Enron Corp. gave back naming rights to the Houston Astros stadium after the company filed for bankruptcy. The Major League Baseball team covered up the company's crooked \"E\" logo emblazoned throughout the ballpark.</p><p>A number of internet-related companies spent millions during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s to establish their brands on stadiums, only to suffer during the years that followed. In 2000, internet provider CMGI Inc. paid for the rights to the stadium home of the NFL's New England Patriots for 15 years. Gillette took over the name two years later.</p><p>A risk with the cryptocurrency industry is that its underlying markets are some of the most volatile. Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies surged earlier this month, with bitcoin reaching a high of $68,990.90 last week. It has since declined more than 10%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Staples Center in L.A. to Be Renamed Crypto.com Arena</p>",
