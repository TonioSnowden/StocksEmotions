  "title": "Broadcom in Talks to Pay About $60 Billion for VMware; The two companies are aiming to announce the cash-and-stock deal Thursday",
  "text": "<p>To help pay for the deal, Broadcom plans to tap a handful of banks for a roughly $40 billion debt package, one of the people said.</p><p>That would make it one of the largest takeovers of the year. Microsoft Corp.'s roughly $75 billion pending acquisition of videogame heavyweight Activision Blizzard Inc. currently registers as the biggest. The VMware discussions, together with Elon Musk's agreement to buy Twitter Inc. for $44 billion late last month, show that despite market volatility, major deals are still doable.</p><p>VMware's shares closed up roughly 25% at $119.49 Monday on news of the talks and after the shares rose more when The Wall Street Journal reported the expected price, giving the company a market value of over $50 billion. Shares of Broadcom, a semiconductor-software conglomerate, closed down roughly 3%, giving it a market value of around $215 billion.</p><p>A price of $140 a share would represent a premium of nearly 50% over where VMware closed Friday, but is still well below the high of more than $200 the stock reached in the spring of 2019.</p><p>Write to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com and Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.com</p><p>Broadcom in Talks to Pay About $60 Billion for VMware</p>",
