  "title": "Netflix Loses More Subscribers, Vows to Speed Up Revenue Growth; Streaming giant in earnings report says it expects to gain 1 million net new subscribers in current quarter",
  "text": "<p>Revenue came in lower than expected, growing 8.6% to about $8 billion, while operating income fell 15%. Netflix said foreign-exchange fluctuations weighed on revenue and profitability, and projected that revenue growth would slow to 4.7% in the third quarter.</p><p>\"Our challenge and opportunity is to accelerate our revenue and membership growth,\" the company said in a letter to investors on Tuesday.</p><p>Netflix is working on a series of moves to boost its subscriber base and revenue, including introducing a lower priced ad-supported version of its service in early 2023 and cracking down on password sharing. It also has been looking to cut costs. The company laid off about 5% of its workforce in recent months, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>In a letter to shareholders Tuesday, Netflix said it would likely start its ad-supported tier \"in a handful of markets\" where advertising spending is significant. \"Like most of our new initiatives, our intention is to roll it out, listen and learn, and iterate quickly to improve the offering. So, our advertising business in a few years will likely look quite different than what it looks like on day one,\" the company said.</p><p>Netflix last week said Microsoft Corp. would supply technology to facilitate the placement of video ads. The company has said it is trying to create an ad experience that is less disruptive than ads on traditional TV but it hasn't specified how many ads per hour of content the new service will feature or what format they may take.</p><p>When it comes to limiting password sharing, Netflix said it was working on monetizing the 100 million-plus households that are watching Netflix without directly paying for it. It said it launched two different approaches in Latin America to learn more. \"Our goal is to find an easy-to-use paid sharing offering that we believe works for our members and our business that we can roll out in 2023,\" the company said in its letter.</p><p>Write to Sarah Krouse at sarah.krouse+1@wsj.com</p><p>Netflix Loses More Subscribers, Vows to Speed Up Revenue Growth</p>",
