  "text": "<p>\"I just killed it,\" Mr. Musk said in a tweet in response to Marques Brownlee, a tech influencer, who posted that his official label was gone.</p><p>Instead, Mr. Musk pointed to Twitter Blue, the company's revamped subscription service that charges people $7.99 to obtain blue check marks and other benefits.</p><p>\"Blue check will be the great leveler,\" Mr. Musk said.</p><p>The rollback of the new verification system comes after two tumultuous weeks at Twitter since Mr. Musk took over the platform.</p><p>\"Please note that Twitter will do lots of dumb things in coming months,\" Mr. Musk said Wednesday. \"We will keep what works &amp; change what doesn't.\"</p><p>Mr. Musk later on Wednesday said in an online Q&amp;A using Twitter Spaces that he didn't intend to do dumb things. But \"if we don't try bold moves, how will we make great improvements?\" Mr. Musk said.</p><p>During the Q&amp;A, David Cohen, the chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade organization, asked how Mr. Musk thought Twitter was doing regarding several criteria important to advertisers, including scale, relevance, brand safety, impact on advertisers' bottom line, and creativity.</p><p>Mr. Musk replied that Twitter probably wasn't doing great on any of those for now. He added that improving the relevance of advertisements shown to users is a major priority for Twitter in the coming months.</p><p>Mr. Musk also expanded on his rationale for scrapping the official label, calling it an \"aesthetic nightmare.\" He said it was \"simply another way of creating a two-class system.\"</p><p>Twitter officials said late Tuesday that the company was introducing an official label to distinguish between accounts that have subscribed to Twitter Blue and paid for blue check marks and those that have been authenticated by the company.</p><p>Accounts that were eligible to receive an official label included those of governments, companies, major media outlets, publishers and some public figures, said Esther Crawford, director of product management at Twitter, according to her LinkedIn profile.</p><p>For a few hours on Wednesday, Twitter designated the accounts of media outlets including The Wall Street Journal and celebrities such as Taylor Swift as official. The labels were removed before noon Eastern time. Adding to the confusion Wednesday, Ms. Crawford said the official label will be a part of the Twitter Blue launch in a scaled back fashion.</p><p>\"The official label is still going out as part of the @TwitterBlue launch,\" Ms. Crawford said in a tweet Wednesday after Mr. Musk said he was getting rid of the official label.</p><p>\"We are just focusing on government and commercial entities to begin with.\" she said.</p>",
