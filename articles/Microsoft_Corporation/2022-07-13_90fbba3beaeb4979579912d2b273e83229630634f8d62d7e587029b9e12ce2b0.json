  "text": "<p>We had lots of responses to my call for jargon-free, sensible solutions for the horror that is the hybrid meeting. A note from Wendy Barnes, chief people officer at the all-remote GitLab, caught my eye: remote attendees should be given roles in the meeting, so they are not left as second-class participants. </p> <p>“This could be hosting, or leading part of the agenda. By normalising participation and leadership regardless of non-physical presence, you will start to drive a better balance between in-person and remote meeting attendees and workers,” she writes. (GitLab's <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/\">handbook</a> has lots of other useful ideas that anyone can access.)</p> <p>One idea that has stuck with me — and which I've tried to put into practice — came from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5943fe5d-739c-49cd-8061-c65af48eb61f\">Erica Dhawan</a>, a digital communications expert. She told me on the Working It podcast back in February that we can make meetings better and more inclusive if hosts think of themselves as TV anchors. </p> <p>“We set the expectation upfront of what the agenda is. We call on people to share, we cut them off if they're going too long. We let everyone know what the explicit norms are: if we'd like everyone to share in the chat or join a breakout room. These things make a massive difference,” she said. </p> <p>Hybrid meetings also came up at an event I hosted recently for the FT Women in Business Forum. I was talking to Ann Francke, the refreshingly jargon-free CEO of the Chartered Management Institute. You can watch our whole “leading in a hybrid workplace” discussion <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUcDvBY7aEs\">on YouTube</a>, but the tl;dr is that Ann says there are no easy solutions to the hybrid meeting problem. Instead, she suggests “simple hygiene measures” such as everyone turning their cameras on, people in the room talking to the camera, and speaking clearly and loudly enough that everyone on screen can hear. </p> <p>Read on for Sophia's findings on the current state of women in the workplace, plus we've found the key to getting your staff back into the office: their friends at work. <em>(Isabel Berwick)</em></p> <p><em>PS The cryptocurrency industry is at a critical juncture and the FT is here to guide you through the deepening crisis.

The World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap report, published today, found that gender parity in the global workforce is <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-gender-gap-report-2022\">at its lowest level</a> since the WEF began tracking it in 2006, declining particularly quickly over the last two years. Women were <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-gender-gap-report-2022\">more stressed</a> than men in the past year, according to data by Hologic, and a Textio study found that women — especially women of colour — are most likely to <a href=\"https://hello.textio.com/feedback-bias\">receive biased feedback</a> in their performance reviews. Plus, American women who had income streams outside their primary job <a href=\"https://zapier.com/blog/side-hustle-report-2022/\">made less than half as much</a> as American men, according to a Zapier report conducted by Harris Poll on side hustles.</p> <p>Despite these dismal stats, women are making strides. According to the WEF report, the number of women in professional, technical and legislative sectors has increased — along with women in management and leadership overall. Income equality also improved this year.</p> <p>Many women are choosing to become entrepreneurs and go into business for themselves. From 2019 to 2020, the number of female founders <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-gender-gap-report-2022\">grew by 43 per cent</a> compared to 32 per cent for men, according to the WEF report.</p> <p>“While some women were pursuing their passions or seeking out greater flexibility, many women became ‘necessity entrepreneurs', due to a need for income or because of a lack of opportunities at work,” said Sue Duke, LinkedIn's head of global public policy. “Many of these entrepreneurs had their hands forced by inequitable working environments. It's clear that taking a hard look at hiring and promotion practices is a critical factor, as is making flexible working the norm for everyone.”</p> <p>And while some women may not have chosen this path if not driven by market factors, they now find themselves part of the most successful league of female founders ever. In their 2021 review, the Female Founders Fund reports that <a href=\"https://blog.femalefoundersfund.com/2021-review-of-funding-for-female-founders-b3008c13d390\">female-founded start-ups raised $54.6bn in funding</a> last year — a 146 per cent year-on-year increase from 2020. There were also nearly <a href=\"https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2022.pdf\">five times as many female-led unicorns</a> last year compared to 2020, according to data that WEF sourced from LinkedIn and the Crunchbase Unicorn Board. </p> <p>As the curtain closes on the era of cheap cash, the pandemic-forged “necessity entrepreneurs” just might have the grit and resourcefulness to weather the coming recession. <em>(Sophia Smith)</em></p> <p><em>Did you or someone you know become an entrepreneur during the pandemic? <strong>Let us know in </strong></em><a href=\"https://compass.pressekompass.net/compasses/financial_times/do-you-know-a-woman-who-became-an-entrep\"><em><strong>this week's poll</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> <h1>Listen In: Work friends matter more than you think </h1> <p>This week on the Working It podcast we are talking about <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/gPBKEPVr\">friends at work</a>. Having a close friend at your workplace is a reliable indicator that you are also going to be a happy and engaged staff member. And as my guest, professor Lynda Gratton of London Business School, points out: having friends at work is a compelling reason to go into the office. She thinks the future of workplaces will be about shared activities — social as well as work-focused. Then I talk to Sarah Gordon, a former FT colleague who remains my friend, about the difficulty of developing friendships when you are senior in an organisation. It's lonely at the top. </p> <p>Next week, we are looking at sport and business. What can business leader, and the rest of us, learn from elite sports people? Featuring former England cricketer turned corporate coach Jeremy Snape, and the FT's former editor, Lionel Barber.

It took until 2019 to hit 30 per cent but less than three years to push female board membership to its current 40 per cent level.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Business book recommendations: </strong>Read about Moderna's rise to a $70bn valuation, glean leadership secrets from an American football coach, learn how to navigate through uncertainty and more in this month's business book<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db769ad8-79ed-4097-97c7-637496f5da0b\"> recommendations from FT editors</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Get ready for salaries to become more public: </strong>Publishing<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/009c6492-796f-4bf5-971b-de49bc662f23\"> gender pay gaps</a> appears to be making a real impact. In the UK, there are signs that companies reporting these figures (which businesses with more than 250 staff have been required to do since 2017) have closed their gaps faster than the rest.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>‘The next Lex Greensill'</strong> In the latest satirical column from Rutherford Hall, our critical communications strategist has to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec3d5ae3-8619-4cab-88af-e9c56d115dbf\"> cover his tracks</a> after his company makes a regrettable hire.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Axing the background check:</strong> As chronic staff shortages shut down swimming pools and restaurants, and leave crops to rot in fields, some researchers say there is rising interest in hiring<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/948f3601-1a95-420d-afa5-29e797a4b238\"> people with a criminal past</a>. Pilita Clark digs into whether the pandemic-driven struggle is easing an entrenched criminal justice problem.</p></li> </ol> <h1>A word from the Working It community: </h1> <p>Our recent newsletter on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d330e276-cf9d-457f-b922-93f01186804c\">the rise of the “slow work” movement</a> resonated with many readers, whether they've struggled with burnout from overworking themselves or they never bought into work-centric culture in the first place. </p> <p><strong>Surita Banger</strong> has completely restructured <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6947979534960873472?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A6947979534960873472%2C6948014325932453888%29\">how she approaches her work</a> in capital markets: </p> <blockquote>  <p>It took me burning out three times in my corporate career to make changes. I left my industry for two years and came back with strong boundaries. I'm now on a four-day work week and only work extra hours when I really need to. I'm much healthier and happier now.</p> </blockquote> <p>And <strong>Michael Winters</strong> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6947979534960873472?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A6947979534960873472%2C6952016863040073728%29\">never subscribed to “hustle culture”</a> in the first place:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Irony being that “slow work” used to be the default mode. Very few have actually been paying attention to the unnecessary quickening pace of our work society, or at least there are very few having actually meaningfully questioned it. I am glad to have largely not played this game. Glad to see others coming around to this as well. </p> </blockquote><p>Source: Isabel Berwick and Sophia Smith 2022 'Female founders are more successful than ever' FT.com 13 July.
