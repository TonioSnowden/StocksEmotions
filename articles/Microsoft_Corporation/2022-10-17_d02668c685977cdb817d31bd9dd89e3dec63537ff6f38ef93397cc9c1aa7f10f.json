  "title": "A Strong U.S. Dollar Buoys Small-Cap Companies' Stocks; The S&P 600 small-cap index is on pace to outperform the S&P 500 this year for the first time since 2016",
  "text": "<p>The trend continued during Monday's broad rally. The S&amp;P 600 rose 2.8%, versus the S&amp;P 500's 2.6% increase, continuing the outsize moves in markets as investors look ahead to a busy week of corporate earnings and make bets about the path of Federal Reserve policy.</p><p>Among the standouts in the small-cap space, Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment Inc. has gained 9.7% this month, First Bancorp Inc. has risen 13% and Children's Place Inc. has surged 30%. Those returns are handily beating the month-to-date performances of megacap bellwethers such as Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.</p><p>Investors are increasingly turning to U.S.-centric, small-cap stocks as the dollar's staggering climb this yearlooms over the profits of multinational companies. A strong dollar can hurt U.S. companies that sell goods overseas by making those products less affordable. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, is up 16% this year.</p><p>Smaller companies are more insulated from adverse foreign-exchange effects because they derive more of their business stateside. Companies in the S&amp;P 600 generate just 20% of their revenue outside the U.S., compared with S&amp;P 500 constituents that make 40% of sales abroad, according to FactSet.</p><p>\"The U.S. economy is pretty much the strongest economy in the world these days,\" said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments.</p><p>The largest companies in the U.S. are warning of the risks posed by fluctuations in the currency market. Nike Inc., Fastenal Co. and Domino's Pizza Inc. are among those that have highlighted negative foreign-exchange impacts during recent earnings calls. Microsoft warned of such pressures back in June.</p><p>In the coming days, investors are awaiting a number of quarterly results for more insights into the impact of the strong dollarâ€”and how corporations are handling persistently high inflation, the Fed's aggressive interest-rate raises and a slowing economy. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Netflix Inc. and Tesla Inc. are among the companies set to report results this week.</p><p>Small-cap stocks haven't been immune to the market downturn this year, but many look like bargains after the S&amp;P 600's 20% pullback in 2022. Wall Street often uses the ratio of a company's share price to its earnings as a gauge for whether a stock appears cheap or overpriced.</p><p>The valuations of small-caps look even more attractive when compared with large-cap stocks. The S&amp;P 600 is trading at 10.8 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, according to FactSet as of Friday. That is below its 20-year average of 15.5 and well below the S&amp;P 500's forward price/earnings ratio of 15.3.</p><p>\"Small-caps are just radically cheap relative to large,\" said James Davolos, portfolio manager at Horizon Kinetics LLC.</p><p>The Kinetics Small Cap Opportunities Fund that he manages has returned 17% this year, according to Morningstar as of Friday. Its biggest holdings include landowner Texas Pacific Land Corp., real-estate company Dream Unlimited Corp. and defense-technology firm CACI International Inc. Texas Pacific Land comprises more than half of the portfolio. Mr. Davolos said the firm is focusing on businesses, such as land companies, with exposure to real assets that benefit from inflation.</p><p>Even with small-caps' drawdown this year, some investment managers aren't ready to buy the dip. Aoifinn Devitt, chief investment officer at investment adviser Moneta, said her firm hasn't made changes to its small-cap allocation, which ranges from 2% to 10% of its portfolios.</p><p>\"For long-term investors, we see the dollar as being a temporary phenomenon that will ultimately work its way out,\" Ms. Devitt said.</p><p>Other market participants are keeping an eye on small-cap stocks as a way to gauge investors' mood.</p><p>\"A rebound in small-caps could be one signal to look at for a broader shift in sentiment for risk assets,\" said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones.</p><p>Write to Hannah Miao at hannah.miao@wsj.com</p><p>A Strong U.S. Dollar Buoys Small-Cap Companies' Stocks</p>",
