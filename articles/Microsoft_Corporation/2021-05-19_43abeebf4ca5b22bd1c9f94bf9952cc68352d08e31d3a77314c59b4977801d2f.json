  "text": "<p>\n  Spooked: The Trump Dossier, Black Cube, and the Rise of Private Spies </p><p>\n  By Barry Meier </p><p>\n  (Harper, 323 pages, $28.99) </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  For some of us, the idea of a private detective is stuck firmly in a fictional past. Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot -- sharp-eyed snoops hired to find the truth about a dead housemaid or a stolen diamond necklace. Private detectives of the present -- real-life ones, that is -- are part of a multibillion-dollar \"private intelligence industry\" that has an \"oversized impact\" on \"politics, business, and our personal lives.\" So contends Barry Meier, a former New York Times reporter, in \"Spooked: The Trump Dossier, Black Cube, and the Rise of Private Spies.\" </p><p>\n  Today's private detectives -- or private spies, as Mr. Meier calls them -- make a lot more money than Holmes and Poirot ever did. That is because they are typically hired by multinational corporations and law firms whose wealthy clients have an interest in finding out what their enemies are up to. Also, the secrecy and ethical corner-cutting involved in spying means that the corporations and law firms don't exactly know what they're paying for. Mr. Meier records a remark supposedly made by Jules Kroll, founder of the first modern \"corporate intelligence\" firm in 1972. Asked by a subordinate how he should estimate the cost of a case, Mr. Kroll responded: \"You should figure out what you want and then triple it.\" </p><p>\n  The job of a modern private investigator is often to discover unflattering biographical data -- aka \"dirt\" -- on the client's foes. A trailblazer in this area, as you may not be surprised to learn, was the Clinton-Gore campaign of 1992. Faced with the history of Bill Clinton's extramarital pursuits, the Democratic National Committee hired the San Francisco-based firm Palladino &amp; Sutherland to find dirt on Mr. Clinton's paramours and so prevent more \"bimbo eruptions,\" as Clinton spokeswoman Betsey Wright unforgettably called them. </p><p>\n  More recently the firm Black Cube, founded in Tel Aviv in 2010, was hired for the same purpose by the Hollywood executive Harvey Weinstein. For that job, social-media experts called \"avatar operators\" provided each operative with \"an online identity, or 'legend,' that consisted of a fake name, a phony past, and an imaginary job history.\" The operatives then befriended the women accusing Mr. Weinstein of wrongdoing. The pseudonymous operative got a Facebook page full of plausible posts, fake friends and a LinkedIn profile. </p><p>\n  The bulk of Mr. Meier's book, however, is given to the story of Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, the former Wall Street Journal reporters who left the paper in 2009 and 2010, respectively, and formed the private intelligence company Fusion GPS. That firm, recall, was hired by the conservative billionaire Paul Singer in 2015 to find compromising information on Donald Trump. After it became clear that Mr. Trump would be the GOP nominee, Messrs. Simpson and Fritsch successfully pitched their services to the Democratic National Committee and hired the former MI6 agent Christopher Steele -- himself the proprietor of a private firm, Orbis Business Intelligence -- to probe Mr. Trump's past for unsavory Russian connections. The infamous \"dossier\" produced by Mr. Steele turned out to be a mix of guesswork and falsehoods fed to him by a single source, Igor Danchenko, a Russian national based in the U.S. who may or may not have known what he was doing. </p><p>\n  Mr. Meier presents both Mr. Simpson and Mr. Fritsch as bumptious, unscrupulous and incapable of self-criticism. He recounts a nasty episode in which Mr. Fritsch, after the health-tech company Theranos hired Fusion to manage media relations, tried to bully this newspaper's reporter John Carreyrou out of publishing a story on the company's fraudulent claims. (The bullying failed.) One reporter remembers Mr. Simpson calling him late at night \"possibly drunk or stoned\" and agitatedly offering to fly to New York to show the reporter Fusion's dossier on Mr. Trump. \"If I show it to you,\" Mr. Simpson reportedly said, \"I need a commitment that you'll do a piece on it.\" </p><p>\n  Eventually, of course, the Fusion duo succeeded in getting their ludicrous document into the public realm by having an intermediary, Sen. John McCain, put it in the hands of James Comey and telling journalists to use the FBI director's possession of it as the basis of news. From there, with the media's help, the document set off a pointless two-year nationwide brawl over Mr. Trump's \"collusion\" with the Russians. </p><p>\n  This, Mr. Meier writes, was \"a media clusterf --  of epic proportions.\" He is right, and he deserves credit for documenting the duplicity of the people who gave us the Steele dossier. Mr. Meier neglects to mention that two columnists in these pages have chronicled the treachery of Fusion GPS and Steele in detail, but put that to one side. He has said what hardly anyone else in his circle of elite mainstream journalists has had the courage to say. </p><p>\n  The problem is that Mr. Meier's aptly profane phrase for the media's handling of the dossier isn't accompanied by any substantive criticisms of his industry. The few sentences of censure he does offer (reporters \"gave in to the temptations of 'access' journalism\") are so gentle as to be exculpatory, and they are immediately followed by formulaic harrumphs about Mr. Trump's badness. It is precisely that need to signal opposition to the 45th president that keeps Mr. Meier from acknowledging the immense damage not only to journalism but to the country brought about by the dossier scam. Mr. Meier barely mentions the fact that the FBI used the dossier to justify surveillance warrants, fails to note that Mr. Steele's source had once been investigated by the FBI as a suspected Russian agent, and seems to regret the whole collusion madness because it gave Mr. Trump a cudgel with which to beat his enemies. </p><p>\n  The only reason we know about Mr. Steele's bogus document at all is that the American mainstream press consists of a lot of gullible and intellectually shallow people. Mercenaries like Messrs. Simpson and Fritsch have been trying to get reporters to publish their idiotic theories since long before the rise of private spies. The difference, in the Trump years, was the reporters' eagerness to oblige. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Mr. Swaim is an editorial-page writer for the Journal. </p><p></p>",
