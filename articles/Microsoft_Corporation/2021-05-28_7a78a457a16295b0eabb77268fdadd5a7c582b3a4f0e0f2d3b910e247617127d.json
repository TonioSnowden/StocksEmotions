Take our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2021-05-28/\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em><br><br>The market for special purpose acquisition companies has become an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee15fbca-8ef7-4b6f-bb87-30378805dd29\">unexpected casualty</a> of the collapse of Archegos Capital Management, as banks rein in lending to hedge funds that had invested heavily in blank-cheque companies.</p> <p>Wall Street banks have become more wary of how much leverage they can extend to their clients following the collapse of the investment firm run by Bill Hwang, forcing hedge funds and family offices to reconsider their investments in Spacs, according to market participants.</p> <p>“Prime broker terms generally have tightened as a result of Archegos,” said a senior banker. “A lot of the return profile for hedge funds is derived from the leverage they employ. It was a gravy train when it was levered.”</p> <p>The US justice department, meanwhile, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/959073bf-c8d1-4044-ace2-0dd1f915a873\">requested information from banks </a>that acted as Archegos's trading counterparties, according to two people briefed on the matter. </p> <p><em>Ortenca Aliaj, M&amp;S correspondent, explains how the Archegos collapse is affecting the Spac market on </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c621ddaa-5284-48b9-8899-58ae721e2ef1\"><em>today's New Briefing podcast</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>US</strong> intelligence community is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e023b1b-8e43-4ba9-81a7-9d65c0e4b020\">split</a> over the possibility that Covid-19 emerged as a result of a laboratory accident, according to a senior official.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Japan</strong> is preparing to announce the extension of a Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b78a18fc-8902-40d8-b4b2-95f49543f47b#post-2b3f2330-79c1-4275-bcf6-335c9b365783\">state of emergency</a> until June 20, a mere month before the Tokyo Olympics are due to start.</p></li>  <li><p>Businesses desperate for <strong>Hong Kong</strong> to reopen are offering cash, extra holidays and even lottery winnings to encourage staff and residents <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85c3d1ef-dcc0-49d8-9680-acf0466a4016\">to get inoculated</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Berlin's </strong>restaurants have reopened to outdoor diners. <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/d35e0ecf-417d-4d57-a075-74c2d4ddcbb8\">But who will serve customers</a>?

On Thursday, shares in the cinema chain AMC surged to their highest level in four years as investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/482ca65b-9eb3-40dc-97fe-b9a4383b8396\">resurrected</a> the “meme stock” trades of earlier this year.</p></li> </ul>  <p><a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/Bn_05I94SXxMfWJ34_Oxug~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRiiiIsP0R_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL25ld3NsZXR0ZXJzaWdudXAtY29yb25hdmlydXM_ZW1haWxJZD02MGE3OTU4MTJlYTM2YzAwMDQ4MjI4YWYmc2VnbWVudElkPTEzYjdlMzQxLWVkMDItMmI1My1lOGMwLWQ5Y2I1OWJlOGIzYlcIZmludGltZXNCCmClP52nYEs8IIFSFmplbm5pZmVyLmNyZWVyeUBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\"><em>Sign up</em></a><em>&#xa0;for our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/vGeTqXq8zydeDye-jHuWDQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRiiiIsP0R-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLWJ1c2luZXNzLXVwZGF0ZT9lbWFpbElkPTYwYTc5NTgxMmVhMzZjMDAwNDgyMjhhZiZzZWdtZW50SWQ9MTNiN2UzNDEtZWQwMi0yYjUzLWU4YzAtZDljYjU5YmU4YjNiVwhmaW50aW1lc0IKYKU_nadgSzwggVIWamVubmlmZXIuY3JlZXJ5QGZ0LmNvbVgEAAAAAA~~\"><em>Coronavirus Business Update</em></a><em>&#xa0;newsletter.</em></p> <h2>In the news</h2> <p><strong>Gates Foundation considers governance changes </strong>The charitable foundation chaired by Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates is considering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27c44ac3-e03b-4c65-b555-f7917ee2f584\">shaking up its governance</a> in the wake of the billionaire couple's divorce filing, weeks after saying that no such changes were planned.</p> <p><strong>What the soaring cost of breakfast may signal for inflation </strong>The costs of raw materials that go into breakfast staples have <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/007bd0a0-f149-427d-937c-ec5b0ef4374d\">roared higher</a> since Covid-19 began, raising fears that a broad commodity boom could push up global food prices. “Food inflation is real in many places. It's not going away soon,” said Abdolreza Abbassian, senior economist at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.</p> <p><strong>SoftBank and WeWork co-founder agree divorce deal </strong>SoftBank has spelt out the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0c047d0-6e7e-42c1-89c8-ee5f96d01a12\">full cost of its bitter divorce</a> from WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann, in which Neumann has received cash, stock awards and fees worth close to $450m following fraught negotiations.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Loeb faces taste of his own medicine</strong> The activist hedge fund manager, known for waging campaigns against the management of companies such as Sony and Sotheby's, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4fdf1805-7305-4aeb-a23c-1c89a3550547\">found himself the target</a> of a frustrated investor in his UK-listed investment vehicle.</p> <p><strong>Russian group behind SolarWinds spy campaign targets USAID</strong> Russian hackers who breached several US government agencies last year have hijacked an email system used by USAID, the development agency, to target more than 150 government agencies, human rights groups and NGOs worldwide, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78c3e01e-6d07-4f69-b6ca-08c1b5b8f1f5\">said Microsoft</a>.</p> <p><strong>Small share of police draw third of complaints in big US cities</strong> A subset of police officers in Chicago, New York and Philadelphia are prompting an outsized share of misconduct complaints in those cities, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/141182fc-7727-4af8-a555-5418fa46d09e\">according to a Financial Times data analysis</a>. The disproportionate result shows complaints are heavily concentrated among what some police accountability advocates term “repeaters”.</p> <h2>The day ahead</h2> <p><strong>Biden to unveil budget proposal </strong>US president Joe Biden is to unveil a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc6aca11-3eae-4a35-bcdf-f26dd7f52cf7\">budget proposal worth $6tn over the next decade</a>, doubling down on his plans for large-scale government investment in the economy. </p> <p><strong>Inflation data</strong> The commerce department's core personal consumption expenditure index, a measure of inflation closely watched by the&#xa0;Federal Reserve,&#xa0;is expected to record its biggest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04ed8422-e16a-4d53-b597-690e4c9c99b9\">year-on-year rise</a> since the 1990s. </p> <p><strong>Putin-Lukashenko meeting</strong> Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko will meet Russian president Vladimir Putin <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/53919b64-e34e-40fa-9e12-cdec909cefe5\">in Sochi</a> a day after two European airlines <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c4d07ca-8d15-4a92-9b71-72c83738cdcc\">had to cancel flights to Moscow</a> after Russian authorities failed to approve new routes that avoided Belarus's airspace.</p> <h2>What else we're reading</h2> <p><strong>Big Oil has learnt it needs to listen on climate change</strong> Events at Exxon this week should act as a wake-up call for other executives with a bunker mentality when it comes to environmental, social or governance issues. Activists today are not just trying to save the world but are also looking out for their portfolios, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b42d09e4-218f-40b7-b461-ac99efa38bca\">says Gillian Tett</a>. </p> <ul>  <li><p>Charlie Penner, who ran the activist investor campaign against Exxon for the Engine Number 1 hedge fund, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52645b30-c378-49e3-8609-4f537284889a\">spoke to the FT following his victory</a>. </p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Big Tech's annual parody of boardroom accountability</strong> At the same time as stockholder democracy was dramatically exerting its influence over America's major oil companies, the annual pantomime of shareholder capitalism has been playing out in Silicon Valley.&#xa0;Distorted voting arrangements limit outside shareholders in Big Tech but the drumbeat of unrest is getting louder, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17708675-b900-4300-a971-8aff028ad839\">says Richard Waters</a>.</p> <p><strong>Don't blame GDP for a slow reopening </strong>While the library, warehouse and pool were in full plague mode, Tim Harford visited a bustling London restaurant that was so normal as to be disorientating. Had he stepped into a time machine? Critics might offer the answer: gross domestic product. <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/44a2f99f-45df-4749-85e0-4eb66b288a9e\">But it is not that simple</a>. </p> <ul>  <li><p>Chris Giles argues that until economies sustainably exceed the GDP levels forecast before Covid-19, no one should use the phrase “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfb2bd91-6a77-4b5a-8423-b922f6754179\">build back better</a>” as something that has been achieved.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Why data is not enough to understand the world </strong>These days Google is trying to blend anthropology with psychology, media studies and, yes, data science to create tools that might “inoculate” more internet users against dangerous misinformation. Will this fix the issue? Sadly not by itself, given the deep-seated societal roots of the issue, <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/4f00469c-75da-4e29-baf3-b7bec470732c\">writes Gillian Tett</a>.</p> <p><strong>Designing democracy on Mars </strong>A political science professor at Yale University challenged her students to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0d95e10-ca83-47f4-9c06-3eab19261ab4\">write a constitution for Mars</a>. Not only might Mars-fixated voyagers such as SpaceX founder Elon Musk be intrigued by the exercise, but politicians should be, too. Edward Luce writes that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb554492-9b15-4af0-8954-ee0f2063327c\">US democracy is still in the danger zone. </a></p> <h2>Video of the day </h2> <p><strong>Why every dogecoin has its day — crypto explained</strong> FT markets editor Katie Martin and markets news editor Adam Samson <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/f90aae62-ccca-4eda-892c-f302324ef8ba?playlist-name=editors-picks&amp;playlist-offset=1\">explain the most speculative asset class</a> and how a token designed as a joke about a picture of a dog online is now worth billions of dollars. </p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Jennifer Creery and Emily Goldberg 2021 'FirstFT: Today's top stories' FT.com 28 May.
