Please help us by filling out </strong><a href=\"https://survey.ft.com/jfe/form/SV_4U54jVmeR3VovZk\"><strong>this brief survey</strong></a><strong> to hit the topics and themes that you find most interesting in the amazing world of Asia tech. Thank you, as always, for your much appreciated support.</strong></p> <h2>The Big Story </h2> <p>Asia's electric vehicle craze is hitting fever pitch. Xiaomi, the Chinese smartphone maker, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/375faff8-6fd0-4d0c-b2b7-b1c13763786f\">announced</a> a $10bn foray into the booming electric vehicle market this week while Foxconn, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer, is <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Foxconn-hits-the-gas-on-vision-for-fabless-EV-future\">pushing ahead</a> with its own plans.</p> <p>Xiaomi's move followed Chinese giants Baidu and Alibaba Group setting out their own electric vehicle plans this year. Huawei, the world's largest telecoms equipment manufacturer, has <a href=\"https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/03/04/huawei-files-two-patents-relating-to-electric-vehicles-and-its-driving-system/\">filed</a> for patents related to electric vehicles, but has denied reports it plans to make its own electric car.</p> <p><strong>Key implications:</strong> The <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/China-tech/China-smartphone-maker-Xiaomi-prepares-10bn-EV-foray\">bonanza</a> in Asia's electric vehicle market is being driven by China. Beijing has said it wants electric vehicles to make up 20 per cent of car sales by 2025. Last year, China sold 19.3m passenger cars, of which just 1.17m were electric.</p> <p>The&#xa0;share prices of other Chinese electric carmakers&#xa0;including Nio, Xpeng Motors and Li Auto have soared over the past year, mirroring the relentless rise in value for US electric vehicle maker Tesla.</p> <p>Xiaomi, which currently ranks as the world's third-largest smartphone maker after Apple and Samsung, said it would invest $1.5bn in the first phase of its $10bn electric vehicle venture. Xiaomi founder and chief executive Lei Jun will lead the unit.</p> <p><strong>Upshot:</strong> Following China's lead, electric vehicle manufacturers in other countries are stepping up. Japanese start-up Fomm is set to <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Made-in-Thailand-compact-EVs-bound-for-consumers-in-Japan\">roll out</a> a “Made-in-Thailand” compact electric car in May. Several Korean manufacturers are also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8c31a4c-b2ac-4694-a601-4adf698d26fc\">advancing</a> electric ambitions. <em>(Check out Smart data, below, for a take on Japan's electric vehicle charging infrastructure.)</em></p> <h2>Mercedes' top 10</h2> <ol>  <li><p><strong>Asia</strong>'s tech companies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cbd43b72-2bd5-4f02-b910-61491d23de03\">raised $38.5bn</a> from equity markets in the first quarter, a record haul.

US companies <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>Amazon</strong> are leading investors in building subsea cables — which carry voice and internet traffic between countries and continents — around the world.&#xa0;</p> <p>So where are China's tech companies? Subsea cables go hand-in-hand with cloud services. Mainland tech giants including <strong>Alibaba</strong> and <strong>Tencent</strong> are&#xa0;spending aggressively to expand their cloud businesses, including outside China.&#xa0;</p> <p>But with the exception of Huawei, none have made headlines as Facebook and Google did this week with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c27153cf-d7ac-4f63-a6e3-537ba7d384e3\">ambitious cable projects</a> stretching across Asia. Instead, China's big telecoms providers, including <strong>China Telecom</strong> and <strong>China Mobile</strong>, are still the main players. Our take is that this is going to change, especially in light of geopolitical tensions between the US and China.&#xa0;</p> <p>Facebook this month abandoned one cable project that would have linked North America with Hong Kong. That creates an opportunity for mainland technology companies, especially those looking to connect China and emerging Asia. Not only do they have the financial firepower and means to do so, but submarine cables would be a natural enhancement of Xi Jinping's Belt and Road infrastructure programme.</p> <p><em>— Mercedes</em></p> <h2>Spotlight</h2> <p>Chen Rui, chief executive of <strong>Bilibili</strong> — which is often referred to as “China's YouTube” — offered a philosophical take on his company's share price fall in its Hong Kong debut on Monday. Bilibili's <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Bilibili-joins-weak-debuts-of-Chinese-tech-stocks-in-Hong-Kong\">shares slipped</a> as much as <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/Bilibili-joins-weak-debuts-of-Chinese-tech-stocks-in-Hong-Kong\">6.8 </a>per cent.</p> <p>“I told my colleagues not to worry about short-term stock performance,” Chen said. “Nobody will remember whether your stock went up or down on the debut in 10 years' time.”</p> <p>The company, which is backed by <strong>Sony</strong>, <strong>Tencent</strong> and <strong>Alibaba</strong>, raised $2.6bn from the Hong Kong offering. It is already listed on Nasdaq, where its share price has surged more than 400 per cent in the past year.</p> <p>Bilibili, which displays mostly user-created content to some 202m monthly active viewers, has been rapidly <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-Spotlight/Bilibili-fights-for-China-s-online-audience-with-2.6bn-listing\">diversifying</a> its offerings beyond animation and games. In recent months, lifestyle, entertainment, tech and knowledge were among its fastest-growing categories. </p> <h2>Art of the deal</h2> <p>To what extent should China's regulators have veto power over deals involving other countries' companies? The question bears asking, said experts, after US chipmaking supplier <strong>Applied Materials'</strong> proposed $3.5bn acquisition of Japanese peer <strong>Kokusai Electric</strong> <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-deals/Applied-Materials-walks-away-from-3.5bn-Kokusai-Electric-deal\">was scuttled</a> by Chinese resistance. </p> <p>California-based Applied Materials, which announced the deal to buy the Japanese group from <strong>KKR</strong> in 2019, said in a statement it “did not receive confirmation of timely approval from the regulator in China”. </p> <p>As the world's largest market for semiconductors, Chinese regulatory approval was essential for the deal. But mainland antitrust authorities dragged their feet on issuing approval for almost nine months, even after regulators in Japan, the US and Europe had given the green light. The deadline to close the purchase had been extended three times because of the delays. KKR is now seeking to list Kokusai on its own. </p> <p>The deal has further highlighted concerns about weak international rules on competition policy and the effect on global M&amp;A activity. </p> <p>“Is there any good reason to allow China's regulators, who clearly aren't committed to fair competition at home or abroad, to have veto power over a deal [between] American and Japanese companies? No,” Scott Kennedy, a senior adviser for <strong>CSIS</strong>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KennedyCSIS/status/1376729946568163330\">wrote</a> on Twitter. </p> <h2>Smart data</h2> <p>Norway is the <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Datawatch/Japan-trails-Norway-and-France-in-EV-charging-stations-per-capita\">undisputed world leader</a> in terms of electric vehicle charging stations per capita. Japan, however, is lagging behind many other countries, as the chart above shows. The number of chargers per 10,000 people is about 6.9 in France — triple Japan's figure of 2.3. In Norway, where 54 per cent of new passenger car sales were electric vehicles in 2020, there are 35 chargers per 10,000 people. In 2020 alone, the number of chargers increased almost 5,000.</p> <p>But Japan still depends on subsidies to expand the infrastructure. Of the 30,000 chargers in Japan, about 20,000 were installed between 2013&#xa0;and 2016, thanks to government subsidies. But the government's budget has declined and the result has been a drop-off in the number of chargers available in the year to February.</p><p>Source: James Kynge and Mercedes Ruehl 2021 'Asia's electric vehicle craze hits high gear' FT.com 31 March.
