  "title": "GameStop Cuts Loss, Builds Sales --- Videogame retailer is modernizing its business under new leadership",
  "text": "<p>In June, GameStop named former Amazon.com Inc . veteran Matt Furlong as its chief executive, alongside fellow Amazon veteran Mike Recupero as finance chief.</p><p>Shareholders also voted Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen as chairman, cementing his oversight of the company following a monthslong, social-media-fueled trading frenzy that helped its stock price skyrocket from the high teens at the start of the year to Wednesday's close of $198.80.</p><p>The roller-coaster ride continued for GameStop investors after the earnings report Wednesday, as shares fell as much as 11% in extended trading. The company's quarterly sales of $1.18 billion came in slightly higher than analysts' forecasts.</p><p>Mr. Furlong led GameStop 's earnings call Wednesday, his first time speaking publicly since becoming CEO. He didn't take questions from analysts and said the company wouldn't provide guidance, as had been the case in recent past quarters. \"We now have unified leadership,\" Mr. Furlong said on the call. \"We are focused on positioning GameStop to scale.\"</p><p>Mr. Cohen didn't participate in the call. He last spoke at GameStop 's annual shareholder meeting in June over a live video stream, during which he reiterated plans to make the retailer more tech-centric.</p><p>He didn't disclose details on strategy, saying that doing so would put it at a competitive disadvantage. He also thanked retail, or nonprofessional, investors for their support.</p><p>Based in Grapevine, Texas, GameStop has reported annual losses for three consecutive years. It has grappled with high CEO turnover and a steady increase in videogame enthusiasts shifting to buying downloads of games from digital storefronts rather than the hard copies that the retailer specializes in selling.</p><p>The pandemic accelerated that trend in addition to forcing the company to temporarily -- and in some cases permanently -- close hundreds of stores. Further, GameStop doesn't sell mobile games, a business that this year is expected to generate more annual global revenue than console and computer games combined, according to estimates from industry tracker Newzoo BV.</p><p>Since Mr. Cohen became a major shareholder in GameStop last year, he has pushed for the company to improve its e-commerce business by enhancing customer support, adding new products for sale and opening more distribution facilities to speed up deliveries.</p><p>Through a series of strategic moves, he overhauled GameStop 's executive team and board to his liking, pushing out people with bricks-and-mortar backgrounds and replacing them with mainly people from large technology companies, such as Messrs. Furlong and Recupero.</p><p>Next-generation videogame consoles from Microsoft Corp . and Sony Group Corp . boosted sales for GameStop in recent quarters.</p><p>In the period ended July 31, GameStop posted a loss of $61.6 million, or 85 cents a share. Its year-ago loss was $111.3 million.</p><p>GameStop 's results reflect a broader economic recovery and so they don't stand out, said David Trainer, CEO of New Constructs LLC, an independent investment-research firm based in the Nashville, Tenn., area. \"They're still losing money,\" he said. \"If they won't turn a profit in this kind of environment, when will they?\"</p><p>Current and former GameStop analysts have said the company's share price doesn't reflect the fundamentals of the business. Mr. Trainer agrees but said he sees potential growth opportunities ahead because of GameStop 's large customer base, brand-name recognition and high demand for videogames in general.</p>",
