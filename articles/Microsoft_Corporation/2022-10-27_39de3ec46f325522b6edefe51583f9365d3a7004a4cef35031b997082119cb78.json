  "title": "S&P Falls on Weak Tech Profit Reports --- Shares of Meta decline 20% after hours as revenue drops for a second quarter in a row",
  "text": "<p>Sentiment took a U-turn after Alphabet and Microsoft reported their quarterly results on Tuesday once markets closed. The lackluster reports from two of the market's most influential stocks exacerbated concerns about slowing economic growth.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 fell 28.51 points, or 0.7%, to 3830.60. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 228.12 points, or 2%, to 10970.99. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, added 2.37 points, or less than 0.1%, to 31839.11.</p><p>\"These companies are really important bellwethers on advertising and on flows of goods and services,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. \"If advertising growth is slowing over there, it is adding weight to that fear of an earnings slowdown.\"</p><p>Microsoft and Alphabet are among the most heavily-weighted stocks in the S&amp;P 500 because of their large market values, so declines in the shares have an outsize influence on the broad index's moves.</p><p>Shares of Alphabet dropped $9.55, or 9.1%, to $94.93 in their worst day since March 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The company's revenue growth last quarter dropped to the lowest level in more than two years and its YouTube video platform posted a drop in advertising sales for the first time.</p><p>Microsoft shares declined $19.34, or 7.7%, to $231.32 after the company reported its weakest revenue growth in more than five years and said it expects a sharp decline in personal computer sales.</p><p>Meta Platforms shares dropped 20% in after-hours trading after the Facebook parent posted its second quarterly revenue decline in a row.</p><p>Still, six of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors advanced Wednesday, suggesting investors are holding on to the bullishness of recent days. The energy and healthcare segments rose more than 1%, while the consumer staples, financials, materials and industrials groups also gained ground.</p><p>One factor contributing to the optimistic outlook: With the S&amp;P 500 down 20% this year, stocks look less expensive than they have during much of the Covid-19 pandemic. That suggests better potential returns going forward.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 traded Tuesday at 16.6 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, down from 21.5 times at the end of last year, according to FactSet.</p><p>\"We're not at slam-dunk valuation levels yet, but we're in a much better place now than we were at the beginning of the year,\" said Andy Braun, senior portfolio manager at Impax Asset Management.</p><p>Among other individual stocks, Chipotle Mexican Grill dropped $107.99, or 6.8%, to $1,476.03 after the burrito chain said inflation is wearing on some consumers. Boeing fell $12.86, or 8.8%, to $133.79 after the aerospace giant said its losses deepened in the third quarter, in part because of problems with its defense business.</p><p>Hess, meanwhile, rose $6.54, or 4.8%, to $142.29 after the oil and natural gas company raised its production forecast for the year.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined to 4.014% from 4.109% Tuesday.</p><p>The dollar weakened, with the WSJ Dollar Index down 1%. Recent dollar selling by the Bank of Japan and Chinese state-owned banks to support their currencies is a likely driver of the dollar weakness, said Jordan Rochester, a foreign-exchange strategist at Nomura.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7%. Early Thursday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 3%, Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 0.2% and South Korea's Kospi was up 1.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.4%.</p>",
