  "title": "Lawmakers Go Home to Fight for Control of the House; Republican and Democratic incumbents spar with challengers on the economy, abortion and Trump",
  "text": "<p>With business in the Capitol done until after the election, GOP lawmakers are confident of a strong showing on Nov. 8, while Democrats are holding out hope of defying conventional wisdom, with the economy, law and order and former President Donald Trump's political influence and future on voters' minds. In interviews, lawmakers laid out plans to debate opponents, knock on doors and spend days driving the lengths of their districts.</p><p>\"A lot of times people haven't actually interacted with, heard from or talked to, especially, a sitting member of Congress,\" said Kansas Democratic Rep. Sharice Davids, who plans to meet voters by going door to door in her district, which was redrawn to be more rural in the recent redistricting process.</p><p>Republicans are criticizing Democrats over higher prices in the past year on everything from gasoline to groceries, while trying to tie them to a jump in violent crime in recent years, after some progressives in the party called for defunding police departments during protests in 2020. Republicans say that Democrats' $1.9 trillion Covid-19 package last year overheated the economy and fueled inflation, and that the party hasn't addressed a surge in border crossings.</p><p>\"President Biden has failed on grocery prices, on energy prices, on crime, at the border, on the world stage, on basic accountability,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said on the Capitol steps Thursday.</p><p>Rep. Mike Garcia, a California Republican who won in 2020 by just 333 votes and is running against the same opponent in a district that President Biden won, said he was 100% confident that Republicans would win the House. Democrats see his district as a must-win if they have hopes of keeping the majority.</p><p>\"They care about the economy, they care about security,\" Mr. Garcia said of what voters want.</p><p>GOP Rep. David Schweikert sees Mr. Biden's weak support in his Scottsdale, Ariz., district as a liability for Democrats. \"In my polling in Arizona, there's a sense of nervousness about his competence, let alone his policy sense,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Biden's national approval rating was 42% in aggregator FiveThirtyEight's average of polls, rebounding from its low of 38% in July but still underwater.</p><p>History is also on the Republicans' side. In a president's first term, the opposing party typically picks up seats in the midterm elections.</p><p>House Republicans are campaigning on their Commitment to America, which promises to fight back on rising costs and hire more police officers. The Republican plan also pledges to \"protect the lives of unborn children,\" nodding to the fight over abortion in this election. A majority of House Republicans have signed on to a bill that would ban abortion nationwide at 15 weeks.</p><p>Democrats point to two recent special-election wins in Alaska and New York as a sign they have momentum, and have touted recent legislation intended to address climate change and healthcare costs, as well as a bill to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. and improve supply-chain woes. They have labeled Republicans as too extreme, have cast them as close to Mr. Trump and see the abortion debate working to their advantage.</p><p>\"It's a choice between Democrats who are putting people over politics and extreme MAGA Republicans,\" said Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.), referring to Mr. Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. \"They are extreme when it comes to reproductive freedom. We believe in it.\"</p><p>Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier, who is defending a district in Washington state, said women \"are fired up about the gall of politicians to tell them what they can and cannot do with their bodies.\" Her opponent, Matt Larkin, said in a GOP primary debate that he favors banning abortions beginning in the first trimester.</p><p>The Supreme Court ended the federal right to abortion access earlier this year, leaving the matter to the states for now and prompting Republican and Democratic lawmakers to propose rival federal legislation.</p><p>In private, many Democrats concede that they are preparing to lose the majority. But they are talking up their chances.</p><p>\"You're gonna see a lot of our front liners hold seats that people thought they couldn't hold,\" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) said on Thursday, predicting Democrats could keep a narrow majority.</p><p>David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report estimates that Republicans can pick up between 10 to 20 seats in November.</p><p>\"It's an unusual midterm because Biden is not the only focus of voters,\" Mr. Wasserman said, pointing to abortion and Mr. Trump as also being on voters' minds. Of the 30 seats that are rated tossups, Democrats are defending 21 and Republicans are defending nine.</p><p>Mr. Trump's efforts to hold on to the presidency after his loss in 2020 are the subject of a House committee investigation and a parallel Justice Department probe. Separately, his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida was searched in August as part of a probe regarding White House records. Mr. Trump, who is considering another presidential run in 2024, has denied wrongdoing.</p><p>Behind the scenes, leadership contests for the next Congress are already percolating with Republicans lining up for leadership spots under Mr. McCarthy, who is expected to run for House speaker if his party wins. On the Democratic side, some are hoping for new leadership, particularly if the party loses the majority.</p><p>Democrats' effort to ban stock trading by members of Congress, which stalled recently, emerged as a flashpoint Friday, with one vulnerable centrist saying leaders purposely tanked the bill. Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D., Va.) said it fell victim to \"repeated delay tactics [and] hand-waving gestures\" by party leadership, which she said needs to be replaced.</p><p>At a press conference, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said she disagreed with Mrs. Spanberger's characterization. Mrs. Pelosi, 82 years old, hasn't disclosed her plans for after the election, nor has Mr. Hoyer, 83, nor Majority Whip James Clyburn, 82.</p><p>Ms. Spanberger's opponent, Republican Yesli Vega, said the incumbent was creating a stir to distance herself from Mrs. Pelosi. \"Abigail Spanberger's election year transformation is becoming stale, it's the same thing every two years,\" she said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook on the midterm elections? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Many Republicans emerged from bruising primary campaigns with little cash on hand but will get a boost from outside groups. The Congressional Leadership Fund, which supports House Republicans, raised nearly $190 million and has only spent about a third of its war chest as of Sept. 30. The majority of their ads across the country focus on rising costs and economic malaise.</p><p>The House Majority PAC, which boosts House Democrats, has raised nearly $100 million and spent only a fifth of its total so far. This past week, the group launched new ads in districts in California, New Mexico, North Carolina, Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. Most focus on abortion rights.</p><p>Of the party's campaign committees, where lawmakers pay dues, the National Republican Congressional Committee has roughly $113 million cash on hand and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has about $110 million as of Sept. 30.</p><p>Write to Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com</p><p>Lawmakers Go Home to Fight for Control of the House</p>",
