  "title": "China Releases Bloomberg News Staffer Detained on National-Security Grounds; Haze Fan, a Chinese national, was taken into custody for unknown reasons in December 2020",
  "text": "<p>\"At the request of Fan's lawyer, China's state security authority decided to release her on bail in January 2022 pending trial,\" the embassy said. Ms. Fan's case is still under investigation, according to the embassy, which didn't specify when she might stand trial.</p><p>Bloomberg reported on Ms. Fan's release on Tuesday, saying it hasn't been able to contact her. The news organization said it was made aware of the Chinese embassy's statement about her release over the past weekend.</p><p>Ms. Fan's detention in December 2020 sent a chill through the foreign press corps in Beijing. Chinese nationals are prohibited from working as credentialed reporters for foreign news organizations in China but are allowed to aid foreign correspondents as producers and research assistants. It is rare for Chinese citizens working for foreign news organizations to be formally detained on national-security grounds.</p><p>At the time, Chinese authorities told Bloomberg that Ms. Fan's detention wasn't related to her work. China's government hasn't publicly disclosed the specific allegations that led to her detention.</p><p>\"We are encouraged that Haze is out on bail,\" Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait was quoted as saying in the Tuesday report. \"She is a much valued member of our Beijing bureauâ€”and we will continue to do everything possible to help her and her family.\"</p><p>Ms. Fan couldn't be reached. The Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A Bloomberg spokesman declined to offer additional comment.</p><p>The Washington Post featured Ms. Fan in full-page advertisements published under its own name on May 2 and May 3, in both cases noting that she was taken from her home by Chinese authorities. \"Speak up for detained journalists,\" the ads said, adding the hashtag #FreeHazeFan.</p><p>The Chinese Embassy in Washington accused the Washington Post of smearing China and interfering in the country's judicial sovereignty by citing Ms. Fan's case in the name of defending press freedom. \"It must be pointed out that the Fan case has nothing to do with her status as a foreign media employee, even less to do with the so-called 'Press Freedom' hyped up by The Post,\" it said.</p><p>The Chinese government has dramatically tightened controls on news media in the country in recent years, detaining local journalists for reporting on sensitive topics and in 2020 expelling a large number of American journalists amid a flare-up in tensions with Washington.</p><p>Ms. Fan was a global business reporter and senior producer for Bloomberg in China prior to her detention, according to her LinkedIn profile. She joined Bloomberg in 2017, after stints in the Beijing operations of CNBC, Al Jazeera Media Network, CBS News and Thomson Reuters, the profile said.</p><p>Ms. Fan's detention came months after Chinese authorities detained Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist working for a Chinese state-run television news channel, in August 2020, also for alleged national-security offenses. Ms. Cheng and Ms. Fan were friends, according to people who knew them.</p><p>The detention of Ms. Cheng came amid a souring of relations between China and Australia. Australian officials have since criticized the handling of her case, saying Beijing hasn't explained the charges against Ms. Cheng, including what state secrets it alleges have been disclosed or to which country.</p><p>A Beijing court held a closed-door trial for Ms. Cheng in March, though a verdict hasn't been announced.</p><p>Write to Chun Han Wong at chunhan.wong@wsj.com</p><p>China Releases Bloomberg News Staffer Detained on National-Security Grounds</p>",
