Hobbs is a win for Arizona voters and American democracy,\" Maricopa County Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Gates said in a statement.</p><p>The dismissal came after a two-day evidentiary hearing held by Judge Thompson on Ms. Lake's claims that various instances of electoral misconduct caused her to lose the governor's race to Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs. Ms. Hobbs oversaw the election but didn't count ballots. \"Another win for democracy,\" Ms. Hobbs tweeted about the judge's decision.</p><p>Ms. Lake had submitted other claims, but those were dismissed previously.</p><p>County officials have said that, despite some issues with ballot tabulators on Election Day, all votes were legally cast and counted. Ms. Hobbs, a Democrat, defeated Ms. Lake by less than 1 percentage point, or 17,000 votes.</p>",
