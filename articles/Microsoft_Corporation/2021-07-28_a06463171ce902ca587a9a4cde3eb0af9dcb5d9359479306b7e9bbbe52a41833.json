  "title": "Tuesday's Markets:  Nasdaq, Tech Stocks Lead Market Lower  ----  By Will Horner and Karen Langley",
  "text": "<p>   U.S. stocks slipped from records, breaking a five-session winning streak for all three major indexes. </p><p>   Losses in big tech stocks like Amazon.com and Google parent Alphabet weighed on the market, while shares of airlines and cruise companies also lagged behind. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 dropped 20.84 points, or 0.5%, to 4401.46. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 85.79 points, or 0.2%, to 35058.52. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 180.14 points, or 1.2%, to 14660.58, its largest one-day decline since May. The three indexes closed at record highs Monday. </p><p>   A powerful rally has sent the S&amp;P 500 up 17% in 2021, while the Nasdaq Composite has gained 14%. </p><p>   \"I wouldn't write this off to anything more than taking a little bit of a breather after the pretty good rally that we saw last week,\" said Jason Vaillancourt, co-head of global asset allocation at Putnam Investments. </p><p>   Investors in recent weeks have cheered strong corporate results and upbeat guidance from some of the largest American businesses. </p><p>   At the same time, they are considering risks posed by the highly transmissible Delta variant of Covid-19, supply-chain problems, a spike in inflation and cooling economic growth. </p><p>   \"We've been characterizing this market as a jetliner that has lifted off and is coming out of the Covid-19 air pocket, but is still trying to find an appropriate cruising altitude,\" said Kara Murphy, chief investment officer at Kestra Holdings. \"We are seeing economic data going from great levels to good levels: that is still indicative of economic growth.\" </p><p>   Fresh data Tuesday exemplified how investors have had to parse sometimes conflicting signals. Orders for cars, appliances and other durable goods increased in June, indicating continued strength in the economy. But the 0.8% increase in new orders was below the 2% gain estimated by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   Consumer confidence in the U.S. increased slightly in July, meanwhile, beating the expectations of economists. </p><p>   An increase in Covid-19 cases across the U.S. is leading some investors to question whether the economic recovery will be as robust as anticipated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Tuesday that vaccinated people return to wearing masks in public indoor spaces in places with high or substantial transmission of Covid-19. </p><p>   \"Not only the Delta variant but other variants are going to be here,\" said Loreen Gilbert, chief executive of WealthWise Financial Services. \"How are businesses going to adjust, how are individuals going to adjust, as the coronavirus continues on?\" </p><p>   Investors were watching earnings reports after the market close Tuesday from tech behemoths. Microsoft posted another quarter of record sales, while Alphabet reported a surge in revenue powered by thriving sales from advertising. Apple posted a record spring-quarter profit as customers embraced new iPhones and other devices. </p><p>   Among individual stocks, shares of Boston Scientific rose $1.54, or 3.5%, to $45.51 after the medical-devices maker raised its earnings guidance. United Parcel Service shares fell $14.67, or 7%, to $195.19 after average daily shipping volume fell compared with a year ago, when the pandemic kept shoppers at home. </p><p>   In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note ticked down to 1.235% from 1.276% on Monday. Yields drop as bond prices rise. </p><p>   Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 fell 0.5%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slumped 4.2% as a selloff of tech stocks deepened, driven by concerns about China's regulatory crackdown in recent days. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index fell 2.5%. </p><p>   The meltdown in China is weighing on investors' appetite for stocks in other markets, but the contagion effect is likely to be limited, according to Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for State Street Global Advisors in Europe. </p><p>   \"The drag on sentiment will be there because China has been the engine of global growth for years now and seeing its stock market suffer like this is going to put a question mark on global growth,\" Mr. Kassam said. </p><p></p>",
