  "title": "U.S. News:  Magistrate Judge Filled Role by Chance  ----  By Deborah Acosta",
  "text": "<p>   When the FBI submitted a search warrant seeking classified information in the Florida home of former President Donald Trump, the magistrate judge on duty in Palm Beach County was unavailable. So another magistrate judge, Bruce Reinhart, stepped in to handle the request, as is typical. </p><p>   Judge Reinhart approved the warrant on Aug. 5, finding that the Federal Bureau of Investigation established probable cause that there was evidence of crime -- an action that has kicked off a series of unprecedented events. </p><p>   FBI agents who searched Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence last Monday removed 11 sets of classified documents -- including some marked as top secret -- according to a list of items taken that was unsealed along with the warrant by Judge Reinhart on Friday. </p><p>   Judge Reinhart, an Ivy League educated judge and former prosecutor who once defended allies of the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, has received anti-Semitic attacks and threats on multiple online forums, and has had his address and other personal details published on at least one of them. </p><p>   \"It's the luck of the draw,\" said Florida State Attorney Dave Aronberg, who has been in touch with Judge Reinhart this past week, of the judge's role in the case. \"He gets up every day and does his job, without fear or favor.\" </p><p>   Judge Reinhart's profile page has since been taken down from the court website. He couldn't be reached for comment. His clerk's LinkedIn page also has been taken down. </p><p>   John Stinneford, a law professor at the University of Florida Levin College of Law who specializes in criminal and constitutional law, said that even if a judge disagreed with pursuing a search warrant at a particular time, they would still have to issue one if probable cause was shown. </p><p>   \"If there is probable cause, they have to approve the warrant,\" said Mr. Stinneford, a former assistant U.S. attorney. </p><p>   Judge Reinhart, 59 years old, spent 12 years as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of Florida before going into private practice for 10 years. Among those he represented were employees of Epstein, including Epstein's pilot and scheduler. Both received immunity from federal prosecution. </p><p>   In 2008, Epstein's legal team struck a plea deal with the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida at the time, Alex Acosta, that shielded Epstein from federal sex-abuse charges and included a promise that federal prosecutors wouldn't notify his alleged victims of the arrangement. Mr. Acosta resigned from his role as Mr. Trump's labor secretary in 2019 amid questions about his handling of the case. </p><p>   As part of a lawsuit filed by two of Epstein's alleged victims against the U.S. in 2008, the victims argued in a 2011 motion that Judge Reinhart violated Justice Department policy by acting as a defense attorney for Epstein's employees after having access to confidential information about the Epstein case in his previous role as an assistant U.S. attorney. </p><p>   Judge Reinhart said in a response at the time that he \"had no involvement in the Epstein investigation,\" and \"did not know any confidential information about the Epstein matter.\" </p><p>   In 2018, Judge Reinhart was sworn in as a federal magistrate after being appointed by a majority vote of U.S. District Court Judges in South Florida, the same week that his wife, Carolyn Bell, was appointed as a state circuit court judge by then-Florida Gov. Rick Scott. In his role as one of three magistrate judges in Palm Beach County, he handles pretrial criminal and civil motions and other litigation matters in coordination with the district court judges. </p><p>   After Judge Reinhart signed the warrant on Aug. 5, the FBI searched the home three days later, seizing about 20 boxes of materials, according to an inventory of the material received. </p><p>   On Friday, Judge Reinhart issued an order making the warrant and inventory list public, after the Justice Department said in a court filing that Mr. Trump's lawyers told federal prosecutors they didn't object to the government's request to unseal the information. </p><p>   Legal experts said Judge Reinhart didn't have the authority to consider the political or historical context surrounding the search warrant, such as whether it was a wise move for the Justice Department to seek a warrant to retrieve classified information from a former president's home. </p><p></p>",
