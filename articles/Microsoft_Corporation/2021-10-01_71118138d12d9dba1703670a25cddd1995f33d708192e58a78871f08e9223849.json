  "title": "Cloud Stocks Sinch and Twilio Soar, Sparking Acquisition Spree; Sinch, a cloud software company that helps companies connect with customers online, struck a $1.9 billion deal to acquire the U.S.'s Pathwire",
  "text": "<p>The field surged during the pandemic, as retailers looked to connect to customers virtually instead of in person. Twilio, based in San Francisco, is valued at $55.3 billion, almost quadruple its level at the start of 2020. Sweden's Sinch, which counts AT&amp;T Inc., Toyota Motor Corp. and Nestl√© Nespresso SA among its customers, is worth the equivalent of about $14 billion, up about eight times over the same period.</p><p>On Thursday, Sinch announced a $1.9 billion cash-and-stock deal to acquire privately held Pathwire, bolstering its offering of cloud-based email services that companies use to market their products. The San Antonio-based company's customers include ride-hailing service Lyft Inc. and German logistics operator DHL International GmbH.</p><p>That follows Sinch's February pact to buy Chicago-based Inteliquent for $1.1 billion and then its $1.3 billion tie-up for MessageMedia in June.</p><p>\"If we want to win on the global scene, which is our stated target, we need to win in the U.S.,\" said Thomas Heath, Sinch's chief strategy officer. \"Messaging is the largest [communications] channel in that market and voice is the second-largest, and we made the acquisitions to get a leading position in both.\"</p><p>Twilio has struck at least nine deals since listing in 2016, according to Dealogic. Its largest was the $3.2 billion pact last year for Segment, a software provider that helps businesses track and manage customer data.</p><p>So far, investors like the deal frenzy, hoping consolidation means increased market share. Sinch's shares rose 5% when it announced the Pathwire deal. And the stock is up 28% so far this year, outpacing its U.S. rival.</p><p>One big winner has been an arm of SoftBank Group Corp., which owns an almost 9% stake in Sinch. The shares have risen about 63% since it made its initial investment in November 2020.</p><p>But Twilio and Sinch's share prices also face headwinds amid a broader selloff in tech stocks. Both companies' shares fell in September. There is also a question whether they can withstand increased competition.</p><p>Software giant Microsoft Corp. entered the communications platform-as-a-service market this year. New York-listed Vonage Holdings Corp. is another competitor.</p><p>And smaller rivals are beefing up. In November Croatia-based Infobip Ltd., a portfolio company of private-equity firm One Equity Partners, struck a $300 million deal to acquire OpenMarket to expand into the U.S. Amsterdam-based MessageBird BV in April raised $1 billion in private-equity investments to expand into that market.</p><p>\"Twilio's stock is not the primary focus of the company or the leadership team,\" a Twilio spokeswoman said.</p><p>Sinch trades at a discount to its rival. The stock trades around 16 times its enterprise value to estimated gross profit for 2022 estimates, said Daniel Djurberg, a technology analyst at Handelsbanken Capital Markets. Twilio trades around 28 times, the analyst said.</p><p>\"If Sinch can continue to carry out its acquisitions without any failures and continue its growth, then we might see the stock close the [valuation] gap,\" Mr. Djurberg said.</p><p>Write to Ben Dummett at ben.dummett@wsj.com</p><p>Cloud Stocks Sinch and Twilio Soar, Sparking Acquisition Spree</p>",
