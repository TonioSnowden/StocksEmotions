  "title": "FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried and founders of 23andMe and Zynga promise to give away most of their money; More than 230 people have signed the Giving Pledge, which was launched by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett in 2010",
  "text": "<p>The pledge was launched in 2010 by Microsoft MSFT co-founder Bill Gates and his then-wife Melinda Gates along with their friend, Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A CEO Warren Buffett. It was designed to encourage billionaires to publicly promise to give away the majority of their wealth either during their lifetimes or in their wills.</p><p>Bankman-Fried is a supporter of the effective altruism movement, which prioritizes giving money to the charities that save the most human lives on a per dollar basis. He's also been active as a political donor to Democrats, including President Joe Biden, and more recently to an Oregon candidate to the U.S. House of Representatives.</p><p>Bankman-Fried's estimated net worth is $20.5 billion. He announcedthat he had signed the pledge on Twitter. A pinned tweet on his account encourages people to donate to the FTX Foundation. \"FTX was founded with the goal of donating to the world's most effective charities,\" the company's website says. \"FTX, its affiliates, and its employees have donated over $10m to help save lives, prevent suffering, and ensure a brighter future.\"</p><p>Wojcicki's estimated net worth was $1.1 billion as of 2021, according to Forbes. She does her philanthropy through a foundation she runs with her sister, Susan Wojcicki, who is the CEO of YouTube. Anne Wojcicki was once married to Google GOOG co-founder Sergey Brin. She co-founded 23andMe in 2006.</p><p>The Wojcicki's foundation paid out about $25 million in grants in 2019, according to its most recent IRS filing. Recipients included the Barack Obama Foundation, the Tony Blair Foundation, and Ashoka, a nonprofit with a mission to \"find and cultivate social entrepreneurs in every corner of the world, whose system-changing innovations solve deep-rooted social problems,\" according to its website.</p><p>Pincus, with an estimated net worth of $1.4 billion, said in his Giving Pledge letter that he wants to focus his giving on the climate crisis, among other issues. \"With my free time spent in the ocean, I feel compelled to address climate change with the ocean at the center. I hope my children can live in a world that is regenerative, biodiverse, balanced, and thriving. To that end, I plan to reduce and offset our family's historical and future carbon footprint by a factor of ten.\"</p><p>The Giving Pledge is a voluntary commitment, and the people who sign it are under no obligation to prove that they have followed through with their charitable plans. In some cases, billionaires' fortunes are growing so quickly that they've only become richer since promising to give away most of their money.</p><p>\"[W]hile some pledgers earnestly intend to fulfill their promises, many are unable to because their assets are simply growing too fast,\" the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning think tank wrote in 2020 when the Giving Pledge turned 10.</p><p>FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried and founders of 23andMe and Zynga promise to give away most of their money</p>",
