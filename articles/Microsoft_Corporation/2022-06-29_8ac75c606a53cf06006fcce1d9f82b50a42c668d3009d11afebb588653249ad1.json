  "text": "<p>The combination of high inflation and continued strong job growth makes now an ideal moment to ask for a raise, say financial advisers and career coaches. Raises are the best defense against higher prices and companies might be more receptive than usual to requests for a raise given the tight hiring market, according to the advisers and coaches.</p><p>\"Workers can leverage every advantage at their disposal to get that pay raise, that promotion or that bump up in title that they may want,\" said Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, founder of Ask the Money Coach, a personal-finance services company.</p><p>Here are some strategies for asking for a pay boost:</p><p>Know Your Numbers</p><p>Determining how much to ask for is one of the trickier parts of a raise conversation, since figuring out your value on the open market can be a job in itself.</p><p>Jane Giuffrida, a marketing account manager based in San Diego, said she's doing homework now to prepare well before her performance review this fall. She regularly checks Glassdoor reviews, job listings and LinkedIn updates at companies in her industry to assess what her title and position are worth.</p><p>\"For me, it's something I consistently keep a pulse on: the industry overall,\" she said. \"How valuable am I to a different organization? What do people pay for my position elsewhere?\"</p><p>To do the same, do a search of available jobs in your industry and specialty: Are companies hiring more, or posting relatively few jobs? Talking with friends and colleagues about what they make and how they negotiated their pay can also help you gather more data. Some places, such as Colorado, require job postings to include salary ranges.</p><p>Compensation for median workers at the majority of Fortune 500 companies was higher in 2021 than in 2019. White-collar workers in technology and finance commanded the biggest increases. More than 140 companies, including Netflix Inc. and steelmaker Nucor Corp., said their median worker was paid at least $100,000 last year.</p><p>\"Pressure is different for people with different kinds of jobs,\" said Linda Babcock, professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University. \"If you look at the market and say, 'Wow, that would be difficult for me to get another job,' then that lessens your bargaining power.\"</p><p>Once you have your number in mind, decide how you want to present it. Prof. Babcock recommends phrasing it as a range.</p><p>If you want an 8% raise, for example, put that figure in the middle and ask for a number between 7% and 10%, she said. Leaving that space open gives you room to make a counterproposal. Don't lowball yourself, either, she said.</p><p>A 10% raise was common in prior periods of high inflation, though it might be less so now as companies talk of uncertain times ahead, she said. \"It seems weird to us now because so many of us never experienced inflation,\" said Prof. Babcock.</p><p>Know What You'll Say</p><p>Once you know your numbers, think about how to make your case. Rising inflation and high employee turnover might be pushing you to ask for more, but Ms. Khalfani-Cox advises against using the economy in your negotiation.</p><p>Instead, showcase your biggest wins—new clients, major projects—and prepare to justify your ask with a greatest-hits reel of your work.</p><p>\"The idea is to show [a manager] what they might lose if they don't then compensate accordingly,\" said Kristen Euretig, certified financial planner and founder of Brooklyn Plans, a financial-planning organization. \"Turnover is expensive. Hiring a new person is expensive. That power has translated to employees.\"</p><p>Be selective in what you include in that \"greatest-hits reel,\" though, Prof. Babcock said.</p><p>Her research found that people have more success in pay negotiations by highlighting their \"promotable\" work, the efforts for which the company has created performance metrics. Workers had less success when they highlighted their \"nonpromotable work\"—such as mentoring, training or planning events. Nonpromotable work usually is ignored when it comes to doling out promotions and raises, she said.</p><p>\"Everyone has to do some, but in lots of organizations, it's not distributed equally,\" Prof. Babcock said of nonpromotable tasks, adding that those duties tend to fall on women and minorities at work.</p><p>Focus on the promotable work—and tying it back to the direct value you're offering the company—will give you the greatest boost, said Prof. Babcock.</p><p>Know Your Power</p><p>Millions of Americans changed jobs in 2020 and 2021, with 4.4 million people quitting their jobs as recently as April, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Companies know that employee turnover remains high and want to prevent any further exodus of key employees, Prof. Babcock said.</p><p>Even if your employer isn't able to match your ask or meet all your demands, taking charge of the conversation still sends an important message to the higher-ups that you're confident in your worth.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What advice do you have on the best way to ask for a raise? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"If you're not piping up and saying, 'Hey, here's why I deserve more,' then that employer is likely to look at you as a less valuable member of the team,\" Ms. Khalfani-Cox said.</p><p>While hearing \"no\" hurts in the moment, Ms. Giuffrida, the San Diego-based account manager, said her past negotiations have taught her the conversation is always worth the effort and stress. She's not sure how much she's asking for this year at her review in a few months.</p><p>\"It's important to advocate for yourself and be adequately compensated for the world we're living in,\" she said. \"Don't tell yourself 'no'—let the company tell you 'no.'\"</p><p>Write to Julia Carpenter at julia.carpenter@wsj.com</p><p>Why Now Is Good Time to Ask for Raise</p>",
