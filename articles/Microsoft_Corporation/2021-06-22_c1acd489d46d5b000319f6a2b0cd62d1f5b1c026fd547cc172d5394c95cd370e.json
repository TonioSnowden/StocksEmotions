Buyout groups are “acquiring publicly listed companies far too cheaply”, <strong>M&amp;G</strong>'s head of corporate financing and stewardship <strong>Rupert Krefting</strong> told the FT.</p> <p>Private equity dealmakers are pushing back. “If you think these shares are worth a lot more, why weren't you buying a lot more of them?” said one senior figure at a buyout group that has approached UK-listed companies. “You're sitting there doing nothing, and if somebody offers you a price for your shares . . . you complain.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Corporate boards are treading a line between the two, at a time when the havoc wreaked by Brexit and the pandemic make it harder than ever to agree on a fair valuation for many companies.</p> <p>Some are “driving a hard bargain”, with “a lot of bids being rejected at the moment in private”, said <strong>Piers Prichard Jones</strong>, co-head of law firm <strong>Freshfields</strong>' M&amp;A practice in London.&#xa0;</p> <p>The latest example is <strong>Wm Morrison</strong>, the UK's fourth-largest supermarket chain. It <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0abdbc0d-051e-4b75-bb41-194ef2ef25d5\">said</a> on Saturday that private equity group <strong>Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice </strong>had made an £8.7bn takeover bid, which it rejected.</p> <p>A few things to note about the potential Morrisons deal:&#xa0;</p> <ul>  <li><p>CD&amp;R, which earlier on Saturday had confirmed it was considering an offer for the grocer, is expected to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da5c8b25-3535-41d6-80c4-944340d17e42\">continue its pursuit</a> of the deal</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Andrew Koch</strong>, a senior fund manager at top-10 shareholder <strong>Legal and General Investment Management</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f530d391-f937-4aff-a53d-a2ad70bae07e\">said</a> CD&amp;R “would not be adding any genuine value”</p></li>  <li><p>This is a property deal, not a retail one, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd773339-d34c-4d81-99b2-b430e320c5a1\">writes</a> Lex. Selling and leasing back Morrisons' stores would provide a quick return on investment</p></li>  <li><p>Those stores might be worth more than people thought, explains the FT's Jonathan Eley in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JonathanEley/status/1406714688805736449?s=20\">this Twitter thread</a>&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <p>Fund managers have been getting more vocal in their opposition to take-private transactions for several weeks, speaking out against<strong> Blackstone</strong>'s acquisition of <strong>St Modwen</strong>, CD&amp;R's takeover of <strong>UDG Healthcare</strong> and <strong>FirstGroup</strong>'s sale of its US business to <strong>EQT</strong>.</p> <p>One banker following the situation described CD&amp;R's initial bid as an “early innings bear hug” that will lead to a price-finding exercise in the next few weeks.&#xa0;</p> <p>With some shareholders already aggrieved about private equity's march on the stock market, it's going to be a particularly delicate dance.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Michael Dell and Sixth Street shoot hoops</h2> <p>It was an action-packed weekend in the US <strong>National Basketball Association</strong> playoffs, with two Game 7s and one <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/hawks-76ers-john-collins-wears-shirt-of-himself-posterizing-joel-embiid-133402510.html\">sartorial diss</a> by the <strong>Atlanta Hawks</strong>' <strong>John Collins</strong>.</p> <p>It was also a busy few days for the league's front office, as the <strong>San Antonio Spurs</strong> announced that private investment group <strong>Sixth Street</strong> and tech entrepreneur <strong>Michael Dell</strong> have joined the five-time NBA champions as minority shareholders.</p> <p>The terms of the deal break down as follows, insiders told the FT's Sara Germano and DD's Sujeet Indap and Arash Massoudi: a combined 30 per cent stake, of which 20 per cent belongs to Sixth Street, ultimately valuing the franchise at $1.83bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's the latest move by private investors to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ba35ff2-ac31-41d2-8ff9-6107a64d0ae5\">buy minority shares</a> within the NBA, after the league recently amended its bylaws to allow more private capital stakes. With club valuations soaring, non-majority owners have been looking for more liquidity.</p> <p>The appreciation in the Spurs' value — Forbes estimated the club was<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/teams/san-antonio-spurs/?sh=7f114f2d38a2\"> worth $1.2bn</a> just five years ago — indicates just how lucrative US sport ownership has become. San Antonio is merely the <a href=\"https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/nba-market-size-nfl-mlb-nhl-nielsen-ratings/\">31st-largest</a> media market in the country. The Spurs haven't won a title since 2014, and haven't made the playoffs in two years.</p> <p>Sixth Street and Dell are hoping to improve the team's digital marketing capabilities, and see appeal in the squad's “wholesome” image, led by three-time NBA Coach of the Year <strong>Gregg Popovich</strong> and former franchise player <strong>Tim Duncan</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>And then there's the chance to rule central Texas, Dell's longtime hometown of Austin in particular. Sixth Street co-founder <strong>Alan Waxman</strong> also hails from the Texas state capital.&#xa0;</p> <p>Terms of their minority stakes don't include a path to control, an insider told the FT.</p> <p>There's another deal on the horizon that may whet NBA stakeholders' appetite: looming media rights negotiations.</p> <p>After the <strong>National Football League</strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0d7f203-568a-47bc-b068-076e22604802\"> more than doubled</a> its current broadcast contract values this year, prospects are looking bright for the next NBA deal, with talks expected to kick off sometime after next season.&#xa0;</p> <p>Not to mention that last month's megamerger between <strong>WarnerMedia</strong> and <strong>Discovery</strong> means the league now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6f5b382-d3f7-4db8-ad89-cf0598501c57\">has the leverage</a> of existing partnerships with the two largest media conglomerates in the world, the other being <strong>Disney</strong>.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>(For more business of sports coverage, sign up to the FT's weekly <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/scoreboard\">Scoreboard</a> briefing <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/subscribe?newsletterIds=5e5e3d297600b40004c209fc\">here</a>.)</p> <h2>Behind the Spac-targeting short seller&#xa0;</h2> <p>Seasoned Hollywood executives <strong>Harry Sloan</strong> and <strong>Jeff Sagansky</strong> may have kicked off the Spac party by taking <strong>DraftKings </strong>public in 2019, but they now have an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb109961-731f-4b3c-ac6c-460b056f2a0a\">unwanted guest</a>: <strong>Nathan Anderson</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The founder of <strong>Hindenburg Research</strong>, who is the subject <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15bcb54f-311e-4c54-bc65-bfa3360f0b3f\">of this profile</a> by DD's Ortenca Aliaj and the FT's Sara Germano, has emerged as a staunch critic of the recent boom in special purpose acquisition companies.</p> <p>DD readers are by now familiar with some of the high-profile businesses Anderson has targeted, including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/653096d3-e338-4d24-bab9-4fcb89f5402e\"><strong>Nikola</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/262690d0-ad60-4488-9e90-e96a465267ab\"><strong>Lordstown Motors</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f913a5a-a6ef-436b-8b58-4a4804665e70\"><strong>Clover Health</strong></a>, and more recently <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/654ab764-2e19-441e-91e3-b535f5f14af2\">DraftKings</a>. Now we want to shed some light on the man behind the reports.&#xa0;</p> <p>Anderson grew up in a small town in Connecticut before moving to Jerusalem where he volunteered for a local ambulance service. That experience, where “you're trying your best to heal things that are broken” still informs his approach to short selling, he said.&#xa0;</p> <p>After a few stints at broker-dealers in New York and Washington, he contacted <strong>Harry Markopolos</strong> — the investigator who blew the whistle on <strong>Bernard Madoff</strong>'s Ponzi scheme — on <strong>LinkedIn </strong>to team up on a case against <strong>Platinum Partners</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The hedge fund was eventually charged over a $1bn fraud and seven top executives were indicted criminally, a moment the 37-year-old credits with changing the trajectory of his career.</p> <p>Anderson's emergence as a short seller has come at a particularly difficult time for the industry.&#xa0;</p> <p>Once lauded as Wall Street heroes for sniffing out fraud, short sellers' reputations have been tarnished in recent years. They've also become enemy number one in the eyes of retail traders who band together to boost shorted stocks.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I don't lead with, ‘hello, my name is Nate and I'm a short seller',” he says. “That's a pretty good way to get ejected from any party or social setting.”&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Mark Machin</strong>, the former head of the <strong>Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</strong>, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/312e3198-296c-4cb6-9f61-9caca1ded5d8\">joining</a> Singapore-based venture capital group <strong>Serendipity Capital</strong> in his first role since <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14313783-cd7e-497a-bb92-92bcb94cda91\">resigning</a> from the fund.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Norwegian Air Shuttle</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c777fe7c-6628-49c2-a767-2c188fd81a8e\">fired</a> its chief executive<strong> Jacob Schram</strong> and replaced him with <strong>Geir Karlsen</strong>, the finance director who led the restructuring that rescued the low-cost airline from the brink of collapse.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Mike Mitchell</strong>, <strong>Preetha Gist</strong> and<strong> Mitch Naumoff </strong>have joined<strong> Orrick</strong> as partners in Washington, DC from <strong>Chapman and Cutler</strong>, where they worked together as a structured finance team.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Lawyering up</strong> Autocrats are using English courtrooms to wage legal warfare against opponents, with London's lawyers and private investigators raking in huge fees.
