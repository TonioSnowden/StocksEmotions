  "text": "<p>Ms. Bohm joins from investment bank Nomura Securities Co., where she has spent nearly nine years, most recently as head of sales, fund financing and solutions Americas in New York, according to her LinkedIn page. The business is a core part of Tokyo-based financial services company Nomura Holdings Inc. She starts with PJT Partners in next year's first quarter.</p><p>In a recent market update seen by The Wall Street Journal, New York-based PJT Partners described both preferred equity and NAV-backed loans as an \"essential part of the secondary tool kit in today's environment.\" Both types of commitments are secured by holdings of recipient firms, which typically have immediate investment needs and a shortage of capital.</p><p>Preferred-equity confers senior status among equity investors, so preferred holders get repaid before other investors in the same basket of holdings, often placed in a special-purpose vehicle. The product is increasingly used to bridge gaps in price expectations between secondary buyers and sellers as buyers are sometimes willing to pay a higher price in return for the right to be repaid first, according to several market participants.</p><p>Preferred equity is also used to raise cash for fund investors without selling the underlying assets outright, an attractive alternative for pension systems in need of cash and loath to force sales at prices depressed by slumping markets.</p><p>Private-equity firms are increasingly distributing the proceeds of NAV loans to investors in their funds, the people said. Many institutional investors won't pledge capital to a manager's next-generation fund unless they receive more money back from previous commitments, while selling portfolio companies has become more difficult this year.</p><p>Using an NAV-backed loan also can increase a fund's internal rate of return, a key performance measure for investors. Improving a fund's IRR can be useful for firms entering a fiercely competitive market for new capital commitments.</p><p>During this year's first half, preferred equity transaction volume climbed around 40% to about $5 billion compared with the same period of the previous year, according to investment bank Evercore Inc. While data on NAV-backed loans is difficult to come by, fund finance provider 17Capital LLP puts the size of the market at more than $100 billion this year, with the potential to reach $700 billion by 2030.</p><p>Write to Rod James at rod.james@wsj.com</p><p>PJT Partners Adds Fund Finance Specialist to Secondaries Team</p>",
