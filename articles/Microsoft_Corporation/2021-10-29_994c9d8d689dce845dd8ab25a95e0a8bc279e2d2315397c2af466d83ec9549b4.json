  "text": "<p>   Amazon.com Inc. posted lower-than-expected third-quarter sales and signaled that a tight labor market and supply-chain disruptions would weigh on earnings. </p><p>   The Seattle-based tech company has been navigating substantial shifts in the economy in recent months. Online sales have surged since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, boosting Amazon's profit, but sales growth has slowed while labor and supply-chain shortages make it harder to meet demand. The company says it has spent heavily to build out its fulfillment network. </p><p>   In its first quarterly earnings report covering a period primarily under new Chief Executive Andy Jassy, who on July 5 succeeded founder Jeff Bezos in the top job at Amazon, the online retailer posted sales of $110.8 billion and generated a profit of $3.2 billion, down from the $6.3 billion the company made during the same period a year earlier. Wall Street expected $111.6 billion in quarterly revenue and profit of $4.6 billion. </p><p>   In the current quarter, \"we expect to incur several billion dollars of additional costs in our consumer business as we manage through labor supply shortages, increased wage costs, global supply chain issues, and increased freight and shipping costs -- all while doing whatever it takes to minimize the impact on customers and selling partners this holiday season,\" Mr. Jassy said. </p><p>   For the fourth quarter, the company projects sales between $130 billion and $140 billion, compared with a Wall Street expectation of $142.2 billion. Amazon said operating income in the three months ending Dec. 31 is expected to be between break-even and a $3 billion profit, down from $6.9 billion a year earlier and trailing expectations. </p><p>   Amazon shares, which closed up 1.59% in Thursday trading, fell 3.8% after the bell with the results. </p><p>   Amazon's cloud-computing business, which offers server capacity and software tools and generates a significant portion of the company's operating profit, has continued to grow at a fast clip. Amazon has also seen strong demand for its digital advertising business, which has increasingly competed with Google and Facebook's powerful ad platforms. Sales for the cloud unit continued to climb sharply, totaling $16.1 billion in the third quarter, up about 38% from a year earlier. Amazon's unit that primarily includes ad sales grew by 50%. </p><p>   Amazon's technology peers showed robust results this week. Microsoft Corp., the No. 2 in the cloud behind Amazon, on Tuesday reported a 48% jump in quarterly profit to $20.5 billion. Alphabet Inc.'s Google nearly doubled its profit in its third quarter, as smaller businesses poured money into ads. </p><p>   Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky, in a call with reporters Thursday, said the company has had to reroute products to meet demand as it deals with labor and supply-chain issues, which increased costs. </p><p>   He said the company also has seen inconsistent staffing levels in its operations because of the labor shortage. </p><p>   The company spent $2 billion during the third quarter on extra pay and incentives as well as other constraints related to its supply chain, he said. With the arrival of some goods disrupted, Amazon warehouses for the first time since the start of the pandemic aren't squeezed for space, he said. </p><p>   Mr. Olsavsky said labor is the company's main capacity constraint, calling the development \"new and not welcome.\" The company, he said, hopes the situation will resolve itself through this quarter going into next year. </p><p>   \"We'll adapt as we need to, to remain competitive,\" Mr. Olsavsky said. </p><p>   The quarter's growth also was dented by Amazon's decision to hold its annual Prime Day sales extravaganza during its second quarter, taking away the revenue boost from the event that has typically been held during its third quarter. </p><p>   The nation's second-largest private employer has said it plans to hire about 275,000 permanent and seasonal employees amid a tight labor market, partly to deal with the anticipated online holiday shopping surge. </p><p></p>",
