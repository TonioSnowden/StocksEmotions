  "text": "<p>   More than a dozen of some of the world's richest people have joined a pledge to donate a majority of their wealth to charitable causes, either during their lifetimes or in their wills. </p><p>   The Giving Pledge, a campaign started in 2010 by Bill Gates with his now ex-wife Melinda French Gates and Warren Buffett to try to kick-start a new era of philanthropy, said Tuesday that 14 more individuals and couples joined the effort in the past year. The nonbinding pledge now includes more than 230 people from 28 countries, including Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk and Meta Platforms Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan. </p><p>   New signers include Tony Xu, co-founder of food delivery company DoorDash Inc., and his wife, Patti Bao; Steven Schuurman, co-founder of software company Elastic NV; Pinterest co-founder Ben Silbermann and his wife, Divya Silbermann; and Melanie Perkins and Cliff Obrecht, co-founders of design platform Canva Pty. Ltd. </p><p>   \"Just like it was done for us, we hope to make investments that will give dreamers and doers -- particularly those that are underfunded or are playing from behind -- the encouragement and luck necessary to maximize their potential and positively impact the world,\" Mr. Xu and Ms. Bao said in a statement. </p><p></p>",
