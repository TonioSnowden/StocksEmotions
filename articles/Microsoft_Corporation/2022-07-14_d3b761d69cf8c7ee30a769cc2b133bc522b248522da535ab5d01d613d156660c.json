  "text": "<p>'Hotel California' Notes</p><p>Three men who tried to sell handwritten notes and lyrics stolen decades ago from Don Henley of the Eagles rock band, including lyrics to \"Hotel California,\" were charged in New York with conspiracy, authorities said.</p><p>While the Eagles crafted its 1976 album \"Hotel California,\" Mr. Henley amassed reams of handwritten notes. An author writing a biography of the band stole around 100 pages of the notes in the late 1970s, including Mr. Henley's handwritten lyrics for the song \"Hotel California,\" Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said.</p><p>The author, whom the district attorney didn't identify, sold the notes in 2005 to Glenn Horowitz, 66, a rare-books dealer. Mr. Horowitz sold Mr. Henley's documents to two of the men who were charged, Craig Inciardi, 58, and Edward Kosinski, 59, the district attorney said. Lawyers for the three men and representatives for Mr. Henley didn't return requests to comment Wednesday.</p><p>When Mr. Henley, a singer and drummer for the band, learned the men were trying to sell the notes at auction houses, he contacted the police and asked the men to return the documents to him, saying they were stolen.</p><p>\"The defendants responded by engaging in a years-long campaign to prevent Mr. Henley from recovering the manuscripts,\" the district attorney wrote.</p><p>-- Alyssa Lukpat</p><p>---</p><p>PHILANTHROPY</p><p>Gates Puts $20 Billion</p><p>More Into Foundation</p><p>Bill Gates said he is giving another $20 billion to the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation endowment this month, and the foundation said it plans to dole out funds faster in coming years.</p><p>The two announcements Wednesday follow a recent Wall Street Journal article saying that the Gates Foundation was adjusting to possible changes in billionaire Warren Buffett's plans for his charitable giving and that a little-known Buffett family foundation was preparing to receive an influx of money.</p><p>\"As I look to the future, my plan is to give all my wealth to the foundation other than what I spend on myself and my family,\" Mr. Gates, the Microsoft Corp. co-founder, wrote in a blog post Wednesday. He also noted that about half of the foundation's resources so far have come from Mr. Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</p><p>Mr. Gates's latest gift would bolster the foundation's roughly $50 billion endowment.</p><p>-- Emily Glazer</p><p>---</p><p>WASHINGTON, D.C.</p><p>Senators Seek Stricter</p><p>Ethics Rules at Fed</p><p>A group of Democratic senators is pushing the Federal Reserve to strengthen new central bank ethics rules and add consequences for those who break them.</p><p>The senators, in a letter to Fed leader Jerome Powell, said rules banning central bankers from holding certain securities and limiting how they can trade don't go far enough.</p><p>The new trading rules were implemented in May.</p><p>The Fed needs to create \"a discernible structure for addressing violations\" as well as improve transparency of the financial disclosure process, the senators wrote to Mr. Powell.</p><p>The senators signing the letter were Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee; Raphael Warnock (D., Ga.); Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.); Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.); and Jon Ossoff (D., Ga.).</p><p>A Federal Reserve spokesperson declined to comment on the letter.</p><p>-- Michael S.
