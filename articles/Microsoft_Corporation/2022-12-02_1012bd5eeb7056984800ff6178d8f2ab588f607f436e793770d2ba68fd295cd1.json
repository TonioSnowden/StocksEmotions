  "title": "Georgia Early Voting Hits Records in Runoff Between Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker; Many voters appear ready for the Senate campaign—and its blanket political advertising—to be over",
  "text": "<p>\"It's getting old,\" Mr. Esslinger said, adding that he had blocked emails and texts and put an ad blocker on his YouTube account to stop seeing commercials and requests for donations.</p><p>Early voting ends Friday, with election day set for Dec. 6. On Nov. 8, neither candidate had won more than 50% of the vote, triggering under state law a runoff between the two top vote-getters.</p><p>On Monday, the first full day of early in-person voting for all of Georgia's 159 counties, about 300,000 people showed up at the polls, shattering the previous early-voting, one-day record of 253,000 set in the 2016 presidential election, according to the Georgia secretary of state's office, which oversees elections. On Tuesday, about 309,000 voted, setting a new record.</p><p>Gabriel Sterling, the office's chief operating officer, tweeted Wednesday evening that more than 1 million people had voted in-person or absentee in the runoff. About seven million people are listed as active voters in the state, according to the secretary of state.</p><p>At stake in the race is whether the Democrats would slightly strengthen their hold on the Senate, which would make a small change in the partisan divide on committees and give the Democratic Senate leadership a bit more negotiating room within its own caucus.</p><p>In November, the party gained 50 seats when Democrat John Fetterman won in Pennsylvania, flipping a seat held by Republicans. That victory ensured the Democrats would control the 50-50 chamber, thanks to the tiebreaker vote of Vice President Kamala Harris. A Warnock win would fatten their majority by one; a Walker win would keep the chamber evenly split with Democrats still in control.</p><p>Mr. Warnock, 53, pastor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s former church, has urged people at his rallies to vote, saying \"51 is better than 50,\" referring to Democratic control in the Senate.</p><p>Molly Bassett, a 42-year-old religion professor at Georgia State University, voted for Mr. Warnock at a polling station in Atlanta on Monday. She was disappointed to have to vote again for Mr. Warnock when he won more votes than any other candidate in November, and felt the law requiring a runoff was unfair. She will be glad when it is over—assuming her candidate wins.</p><p>\"It will be close,\" she said. \"There are blue bubbles which are making Georgia purple, but there is still a lot of red in this state.\"</p><p>Mr. Walker, 60, a former professional football player, is having his campaign sell bumper stickers declaring \"#34 for 50.\" The sticker refers to Mr. Walker's number when he played football for the University of Georgia and the GOP goal of holding the Democrats to a 50-50 split.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think will be the outcome of the runoff election in Georgia, and why? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In conservative Paulding County, northwest of metro Atlanta, David and Laura Wyton, both 54, cast ballots for Mr. Walker. Mr. Wyton, wearing a MAGA T-shirt, says he lost faith in Georgia's elections since former President Donald Trump lost the state in 2020 to President Biden. Two full recounts of the vote and a partial audit by state officials found no evidence of widespread fraud. Lawsuits filed in various courts alleging fraud were dismissed.</p><p>\"Very dismayed, very discouraged, but I am still going to do my civic duty,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Warnock, in a blue bus, and Mr. Walker, in a red bus, have been shuttling around the state. Former President Barack Obama returned to Georgia Thursday to urge voters in the Atlanta area, a Democratic stronghold, to send Mr. Warnock back to Washington.</p><p>The same day, Mr. Walker will be rallying voters in Columbus, Ga., and Atlanta's northern suburbs, urging them to help him retake a high-profile post the GOP lost two years ago in a contentious runoff.</p><p>On the stump, Messrs. Warnock and Walker have appeared with national political leaders and celebrities. In addition to Mr. Obama, Mr. Warnock has campaigned with New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and hosted a concert with the Dave Matthews Band. Mr. Walker has campaigned with Sens. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) and Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.).</p><p>Since the runoff began, Mr. Warnock has made 39 public appearances, according to his campaign. Mr. Walker's campaign didn't respond to a request for information about his appearances, but they have been far fewer than Mr. Warnock's.</p><p>Grace Kim, 43, voted Wednesday afternoon for Mr. Warnock after waiting outside an Atlanta polling station for 50 minutes. She had driven by the location four times in recent days to see when the line was less long.</p><p>Ms. Kim says she is tired of the harsh political atmosphere and candidates focusing on attacking each other's personal mistakes instead of policy positions. She has been blocking political spam calls on her phone, but despite her efforts, she still had four such calls to her phone on Wednesday morning, she said.</p><p>\"It's just exhausting when you have to listen to a lot of irrelevant shouting,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Cameron McWhirter at Cameron.McWhirter@wsj.com</p>",
