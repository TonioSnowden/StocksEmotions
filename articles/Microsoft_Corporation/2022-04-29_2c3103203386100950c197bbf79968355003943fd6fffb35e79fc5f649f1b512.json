  "text": "<p>The Nasdaq Composite stock index has undergone its heaviest one-month sell-off since the depths of the global financial crisis, as concerns about rising interest rates and slowing economic growth were exacerbated by softer business updates from tech giants such as Amazon, Apple and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3b63a57-0d46-41c7-8f6b-c61d388db039\">Netflix</a>.</p> <p>The tech-dominated index sank 4.2 per cent on Friday following lacklustre results by Amazon and Apple the previous evening. The move brought the Nasdaq's April fall to 13.3 per cent, the worst monthly decline since October 2008, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers had rocked financial markets. </p> <p>The index has shed more than $5tn in total market capitalisation from its all-time high last November. Analysts at Bank of America summed up investor sentiment on Friday as “just awful”.</p> <p>Apple, the US's most valuable company, reported stronger than expected quarterly revenues on Thursday but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e3a4e49-151d-4e83-b7ca-c532addba11e\">warned </a>that supply chain shortages and Chinese factory shutdowns could cost it up to $8bn in the second quarter. </p> <p>Amazon, the online retailer and cloud computing group, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7392d63-0eb5-4345-9ef5-3edbf0c20f7c\">blamed </a>slipping online sales and rising costs for its slowest ever quarterly revenue growth. Its shares tumbled 14 per cent on Friday, while Apple's dropped 3.7 per cent.</p> <p>The announcements followed earlier misses by fellow tech giants such as Netflix and Google parent Alphabet. The high-profile let-downs have weighed on the stock market despite a fairly positive earnings season across members of the broader S&amp;P 500 stock index, highlighting the dominance of the tech sector on major US indices.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 benchmark dropped 8.8 per cent in April, including a 3.6 per cent decline on Friday for its worst month since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.</p> <p>Of the more than 250 S&amp;P constituents that have reported first-quarter results, about 80 per cent beat earnings forecasts, according to FactSet. Amazon alone dragged the index's year-over-year earnings growth rate from just above 10 per cent to 7.1 per cent.</p> <p>Less tech-dominated European indices fared slightly better, with the Stoxx 600 index adding 0.7 per cent on Friday and dipping just 1.2 per cent over the month. </p> <p>“The dominance of the tech sector is a US phenomenon,” said Sonja Laud, chief investment officer at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, pointing out that shares in Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Alphabet, Meta and Netflix made up almost a quarter of the S&amp;P 500. </p> <p>“The sector composition in Europe is very different,” she added, where markets “can do well on the back of rising commodity and energy prices”.&#xa0;</p> <p>European markets were helped on Friday by hopes that Chinese authorities would take action to safeguard the world's second-largest economy from further widespread coronavirus shutdowns.</p> <p>The Communist party's decision-making body promised on Friday to “strengthen macro adjustments” and “achieve full-year economic and social development goals”.</p> <p>“A lot of investors [in Europe] are mainly focused on China, as China really powers the global growth engine and a lot of hopes are hinging on China pulling an ace out of its sleeve” in terms of economic stimulus, said Gregory Perdon, co-chief investment officer at Arbuthnot Latham. </p> <p>The euro rose 0.4 per cent against the dollar to about $1.05, but it remained close to its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b81f2134-5fca-4447-8a46-3c86cb0da4c7\">weakest level in five years</a> as traders anticipate the US Federal Reserve moving faster than the European Central Bank in raising interest rates to battle inflation. Markets are tipping the Fed to raise its main borrowing rate by half a percentage point at its meeting scheduled next week. </p> <p>The yield on the two-year US Treasury note, which closely tracks monetary policy expectations, rose 0.1 percentage points to 2.70 per cent on Friday after strong consumer spending data. “This really cements the idea that the Fed is going to have to do multiple 50-basis point hikes,” said Baylee Wakefield, multi-asset portfolio manager at Aviva Investors. Bond yields rise as their prices fall. </p><p>Source: Francesca Friday and Nicholas Megaw in New York, Naomi Rovnick in London and William Langley in Hong Kong  2022 'Nasdaq index marks worst monthly drop since 2008 financial crisis' FT.com 29 April.
