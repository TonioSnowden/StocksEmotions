  "text": "<p>Apollo Global Management has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9c58238-9824-4ba0-9e28-01f95126cb45\">abandoned plans</a> to bid alone for Wm Morrison and is in talks to team up with the Fortress-led takeover consortium.</p> <p>A trio of private investment groups led by SoftBank-owned Fortress this month struck a £9.5bn deal to acquire the supermarket chain. A few days later Apollo said it was also looking at Morrisons but has now changed tack. </p> <p>“Apollo notes Fortress's intentions regarding the Morrisons business and all its stakeholders,” it said. “Should these discussions lead to any transaction, Apollo would be fully supportive of Fortress's stated intentions regarding Morrisons.” </p> <p>Under the terms of the deal revealed on July 4, Fortress, the Canadian pension fund CPPIB and a unit of Koch Industries will pay 252p a share along with backing a 2p special dividend to buy the grocer. </p> <p>The deal came two weeks after the Bradford-based group said it had rejected an unsolicited <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da5c8b25-3535-41d6-80c4-944340d17e42\">230p-a-share approach</a> from the private equity group Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, which has yet to formally drop its interest.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>EasyJet</strong> plans to fly 60 per cent of its pre-pandemic capacity over the summer but said its plans are flexible, depending upon the status of travel restrictions. For the fiscal third quarter ended June easyJet said it had flown just 17 per cent of capacity and that total cash burn during the quarter was £34m per week on average. Passenger numbers totalled 3m in the quarter, generating group revenue of £212.9m against headline costs of £531.2m. With customers booking closer to departure, easyJet was unable to offer any financial targets for the remainder of the year. </p> <p><strong>Fevertree Drinks</strong> hiked revenue guidance after making a strong start to the year but cautioned that disruption to logistics networks was putting margins under pressure. The tonic water maker said to expect only limited improvement next year as logistics problems combine with higher product and raw materials costs. Its new 2021 guidance was for revenue of between £295m and £304m (from £280m to £292m previously) and an ebitda margin of about 20 per cent. For the first half Fevertree posted revenue of £141.8m, up 39 per cent year on year, on European and US expansion</p> <p>Drinks maker <strong>AG Barr</strong> said trading since March has been better than anticipated. Customer restocking in the hospitality sector and momentum from new product launches meant that for the year ending January 2022, AG Barr now expects results to be slightly ahead of the pre-Covid period.</p> <p>Currency dealer <strong>Wise</strong> said in a maiden trading update following its float this month that trading has been in line with expectations. Revenue in its fiscal first quarter was up 43 per cent to £123.5m as Wise handled £16.4bn of transfers, up 54 per cent year on year. </p> <p><strong>Anglo American</strong>'s second quarter update showed diamond production more than doubling and platinum production surging by 59 per cent. The miner said it had maintained operating levels at approximately 95 per cent of normal capacity.</p> <p><strong>Virgin Wines</strong> said it has traded positively with strong levels of customer demand in May and June. Revenue and ebitda for the year ended June are now anticipated to be marginally higher than previous expectations, with revenue up 30 per cent to £73.8m and ebitda up 45 per cent to £6.4m, it said.</p> <p>Veterinary group <strong>CVS</strong> said profit for the year ended June will be marginally ahead of recently upgraded market expectations.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <p>Card Factory founder&#xa0;Dean Hoyle will step down as chair of retailer <strong>TheWorks</strong>, to be succeeded by former Tesco executive Carolyn Bradley. News of the change came as The Works posted full-year results to May showing a £2.8m pre-tax loss on revenue up 19.7 per cent to £180.7m.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>The threat of the <strong>Delta variant</strong> of Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ca0bcb0-053d-4cb7-9ecb-8abf103b7dc7\">hit Asian markets overnight</a> after US and European stocks fell sharply on concerns that new outbreaks of the virus would hit global growth. A stock market sell-off&#xa0;has pulled many sectors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/072615ec-93e7-4c72-aac0-ae049cb0f72a\">into correction territory</a> — 10 per cent below their peaks.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>UBS</strong> reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4231aa22-f7ac-49f0-aca6-7ef75758e458\">a surge</a> in second-quarter profits, as an easing in pandemic restrictions during the spring helped drive business at its wealth management division. Net profit for the three months to the end of June rose to $2bn, up 63 per cent from a year ago, and comfortably exceeding the $1.35bn analysts had forecast.</p> <p>The White House and its western allies&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54803790-ac33-4616-a0b5-7c39e3ea0b29\">accused Beijing</a>&#xa0;of teaming up with criminal gangs to commit widespread <strong>cyber attacks</strong>, including one on Microsoft this year that affected tens of thousands of organisations. Chinese diplomats <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe589e37-2f85-428e-a0ef-cbb5a5211157\">hit back</a> against the accusations today.</p> <p><strong>BlackRock</strong> stepped up&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/630d6042-2433-49b9-8a04-d40c87f5a9e0\">opposition to executive pay</a>&#xa0;in Europe over the past year, voting against salary packages for bosses at public companies that laid off workers during the pandemic. Critics have accused the asset manager of not doing enough given its claims to be a champion of ESG standards.</p> <p><strong>LVMH</strong> has acquired a majority stake in menswear designer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12b28feb-a695-4109-aa7c-ada06011f011\">Virgil Abloh's Off-White label</a> and expanded his role at the luxury group in an attempt to attract younger customers. LVMH declined to disclose terms.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>Philip Morris International <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8166833e-fc4b-42cd-b8c6-509a483e70a2\">likes to talk about purpose</a>, but its £1bn deal to buy UK inhaler business Vectura causes confusion on both sides.</p> <p><strong>Sarah O'Connor</strong> <br>Nostalgia for manufacturing jobs is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c76f36a-5523-47e0-b038-4c79ba2365ba#comments-anchor\">understandable but unimaginative</a>. A durable strategy to help lower-paid workers and their local economies would be to fight for improvements to service sector jobs that do not lack the scope and productivity growth that could sustain better pay and conditions.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'US private equity group Apollo joins Fortress to bid for Morrisons' FT.com 20 July.
