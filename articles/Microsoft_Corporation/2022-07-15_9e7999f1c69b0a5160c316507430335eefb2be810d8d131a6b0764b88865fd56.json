  "text": "<p>Many Uyghurs yearn for a return to an independent East Turkestan, but such aspirations are strikingly absent in the writings of Ilham Tohti, a 52-year-old economics professor who has been a fearless advocate for his people. His only demand from Beijing is for a full grant of autonomy to the Uyghurs under the terms of China's constitution and for an end to the vassal-like subordination of Uyghurs by the Han Chinese. The government should \"see to it that local people are treated equally,\" he wrote in a piece published in 2007 on Uyghur Online, a now-defunct website he founded to \"help all ethnic groups in China—as well as the world—understand Xinjiang and the Uyghurs.\"</p><p>16 Books We Read This Week</p><p>Voices from a persecuted Uyghur culture, introducing modern art to wary Americans, a daring Arctic rescue and more.</p><p>This demand for autonomy and dignity within the Chinese state—stubbornly expressed and quietly eloquent—is voiced often in \"We Uyghurs Have No Say,\" a slim volume of Mr. Tohti's essays, speeches, open letters and interviews. And yet: Despite never asking for sovereignty for the Uyghurs, he was charged with \"separatism\"—a most heinous crime in China—and sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2014.</p><p>Mr. Tohti, jailed now for eight years, has come to be known as the \"Chinese Mandela.\" The People's Daily, a propaganda rag of the Chinese Communist Party, ran a piece about him titled \"Mandela Analogy Shows Ignorance of History,\" in which it asserted that Mr. Tohti \"preaches hatred and killing.\" In a preface to Mr. Tohti's book, Rian Thum, a senior lecturer in East Asian History at the University of Manchester, pushes back, writing that the comparison with Mandela captures Mr. Tohti's \"magnanimity, his patience, his moral gravity, and his unfathomable courage in the face of brutal imprisonment.\" He also argues that Mr. Tohti is not a politician or an activist but a scholar.</p><p>Whether politico or professor, Mr. Tohti phrases his demands as unprovocatively as possible. Mr. Thum notes that he \"offers up narratives of a generous [Communist] party and a just Chinese nation-state,\" narratives that would permit them to \"gracefully compromise without ceding power.\" In an essay from 2011 in which Mr. Tohti sets out his ideals, he writes of his \"hope\" that China will become \"a great nation of harmonious inter-ethnic coexistence.\" In the same essay, he proposes that July 5—notorious in China as the day in 2009 on which bloody riots erupted in Xinjiang between native Uyghurs and Han settlers—be marked as \"National Harmony Day.\" Remarkably, in a statement he made hours after he was given his life sentence, he said that he still lived \"in anticipation of the sun and the future. I am convinced that China will become better and that the constitutional rights of the Uyghur people will, one day, be honored.\"</p><p>Mr. Tohti is being held in the First Prison in Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital. No member of his family has been allowed to visit him since 2017. Jewher Ilham, Mr. Tohti's 28-year-old daughter, lives in the U.S., having boarded a flight out of Beijing in 2013 that her father was kept from taking. She hasn't seen him since that day, and a Skype call in January 2014 was the last time she was able to speak to him. \"I don't know how my father is,\" she tells me in a phone call from Washington. Only \"rumors,\" she says, offer her any sense of how he's doing.</p><p>Why has China imprisoned a man so conciliatory, who makes plain that he doesn't seek its breakup? Nury Turkel, a commissioner at the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, offers an answer. Beijing, he writes in \"No Escape: The True Story of China's Genocide of the Uyghurs,\" has learned a lesson from Tibet, another \"autonomous\" region China annexed against the will of its natives. It has been \"extremely bad PR to have an outspoken and respected\" leader like the Dalai Lama reminding the world of \"the tragedy that has befallen his people.\" While Mr. Tohti isn't the spiritual head of the Uyghurs in any sense, his impeccable reasonableness—and his deference to China's constitution, hardly the way of a subversive—made him dangerous on the world stage.</p><p>So Mr. Tohti had to be silenced, writes Mr. Turkel, himself a Uyghur and the first Uyghur-American to rise to a political position in the U.S. He styles his book a \"memoir,\" but his own hair-raising story is only one of many he tells. He was born in 1970, in a prison camp, his pregnant mother—only 19—having been imprisoned because her father had been involved in Uyghur politics before the Communists took power. She was so ill-fed in jail that she could scarcely breastfeed her son. Before giving birth, she had been hit on her swollen belly by a guard.</p><p>Mr. Turkel did well at school and at age 25—in 1995—left China for studies in the U.S., never to return. He went to law school and cofounded the Uyghur Human Rights Project, an advocacy group based in Washington. After 9/11, he represented a group of Uyghurs who had been swept up by U.S. forces in Afghanistan and sent to Guantanamo. He secured their release: They were, it emerged, refugees from Xinjiang, not members of al Qaeda. But Mr. Turkel grasped that this handful of Uyghurs in the U.S. dragnet allowed China to \"rebrand Uyghurs as dangerous Islamic extremists.\" Beijing began to assert that all political disturbances in Xinjiang were, as he says, \"motivated by Al Qaeda sympathies.\" China reckoned that this would give it carte blanche—in the midst of the Global War on Terror—to crack down on the Muslim Uyghurs.</p><p>And so a people already reeling from decades of Han Chinese repression were brought to their knees. Mr. Turkel's book is a harrowing mix of factual detail and depictions of everyday life. As with Tibet, Xinjiang was subject not to ethnic cleansing but to a form of ethnic dilution or dissolution, the result of a concerted policy to \"settle\" the region with Han Chinese. The settling was begun by Mao in 1949. By 1975, there were five million Han in Xinjiang. Today, Mr. Turkel says, there are 11 million Uyghur and 8.2 million Han. And as Han numbers soar, the state does everything—including forced sterilizations—to suppress the Uyghur birth rate.</p><p>Xinjiang, Mr. Turkel writes, is a totalitarian amalgam of the North Korean police state, Nazi-style concentration camps—credibly believed to hold a million Uyghurs, subjected to torture and \"re-education\"—South Africa-like apartheid, and China's own Cultural Revolution. Four-fifths of Xinjiang's mosques have been razed or damaged in a drive against the Islamist phantom. With the Uyghur language no longer taught in schools and Mandarin now mandatory, Mr. Turkel mourns the deleting of a culture.</p><p>Surveillance, both crude and high-tech, is suffocating. In a program called \"Becoming Family,\" the state houses supervisors in Uyghur homes. They must be fed and offered beds to sleep in. They watch the families at work and at rest, taking notes as well as liberties—often demanding sexual favors and forcing Muslim men to drink alcohol. He writes of a schoolteacher whose marriage ended when a supervisor raped her in her own house and her husband felt powerless to intervene. Alongside this, says Mr. Turkel, Xinjiang has become a vast laboratory for China to \"perfect the art of digital dictatorship, a new kind of AI totalitarian state.\"</p><p>Mr. Turkel acknowledges U.S. efforts to curb the horrors in Xinjiang. He gives thanks to Mike Pompeo, President Trump's secretary of state, for designating as \"genocide\" the Chinese policies of repression there. And he notes that President Biden signed into law the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. This bans the import into the U.S. of products made in, or containing materials from, Xinjiang, unless they can be shown to have been produced without \"forced labor.\" But no other countries have followed suit. China, the world's second largest economy, is much harder to sanction than Russia.</p><p>\"No Escape\" leaves us with a sense of bleak foreboding, just as \"We Uyghurs Have No Say\" teaches us how powerless the Uyghurs are. China's vultures aren't circling over a prostrate people, they are perched alongside them, pecking at their eyes and tongues, pecking, indeed, at their very hearts.</p><p>Mr. Varadarajan, a Journal contributor, is a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and at Columbia University's Center on Capitalism and Society.</p><p>Two Books Decry the Uyghur Tragedy in China</p>",
