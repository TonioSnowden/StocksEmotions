  "text": "<p>Wristcam for Apple Watch</p><p>If you begrudgingly carry your phone on runs or hikes just so you can capture the views, consider a Wristcam. This souped-up Apple Watch band has two built-in photo/video cameras. The 8-megapixel \"world-facing\" camera even snaps underwater up to 1 meter deep. There's also a selfie camera, and you can do live video messaging, though that gets a bit complicated. The image quality isn't iPhone grade, but it'll do for getting quick shots when a phone would be too cumbersome or risky. $299; wristcam.com</p><p>Tempo Move Home Fitness System</p><p>Many people lack the space or budget for high-tech home gym equipment. Enter the Tempo Move, an affordable pared-down workout system tucked inside an inconspicuous end table. It holds 50 pounds of weight plates, and has a smartphone dock so you can stream Tempo's mobile app on your TV while your iPhone tracks your body movements for feedback on your form. The solid, diverse lineup of fitness classes includes yoga, high-intensity interval training, strength and cardio sessions for people at varying skill levels. $495 plus $39 a month; tempo.fit</p><p>Gita Mini by Piaggio Fast Forward</p><p>Piaggio Fast Forward's Gita Mini is the startup's second cargo-carrying robot, with a lower price and improved ability to follow owners on crowded streets, using machine vision. The two-wheel, 28-pound basket can haul up to 20 pounds of cargo and runs for seven hours on a charge. It can't go everywhere -- especially stairs. Still, it's a fun gadget for trips to the farmers market -- especially if you like being the center of attention. $1,850; piaggiofastforward.com</p><p>Sonos Roam Portable Speaker</p><p>Most portable speakers stay in a closet until needed, along with other just-for-outdoors gear. The water- and drop-resistant Sonos Roam is different: It can play audio over Bluetooth and work seamlessly with your at-home AirPlay 2 or Wi-Fi-enabled Sonos setup too. It might take a while to get used to the speaker's multiple button controls and status lights. Still, the burrito-size device produces clear, well-balanced audio and makes for an ideal Alexa-powered shower companion. $179; sonos.com</p><p>Apple iPhone 13 -- All Four of Them</p><p>\"Happy holidays! Here's the wrong iPhone 13.\" Choosing between all four of the new models is tough. Don't yearn for a phone the size of a spruce tree? Go Mini. Want the same phone but with a bigger screen and bigger battery? iPhone 13. A smoother-scrolling display and a third rear camera for telephoto shots? The iPhone 13 Pro is our sweet spot. However, if you go up to the 13 Pro Max, you'll get a day-and-a-half of battery life and one ginormous screen -- and a price higher than the MacBook Air's. $699 and up; apple.com</p><p>Form Smart Swim Goggles</p><p>This isn't the first time we mentioned these augmented-reality swim goggles in a gift guide, but they've been updated with a compelling feature: open-water and swim-spa metrics. For pool swimmers, there are new guided workouts that display in-goggle instructions for sets and drills. The app also has video tutorials to improve your stroke. $239, plus $15 a month after the first year; formswim.com</p><p>GameBud Talking Tom Animatronic Toy</p><p>Talking Tom is a sassy cat with a huge following among kids under 10, who mainly know him from games, videos and related merch. In this incarnation, he's a cartoon-eyed, jaw-flapping robot, a home version of a Chuck E. Cheese animatronic but internet connected, so he has nearly limitless things to say. Parents, we'll warn you now, this might backfire in the future when he still won't shut up, but if you just want to win at the gift game, this is a good card to play. $100; gamebud.com</p><p>Beats Fit Pro Noise-Canceling Earbuds</p><p>The AirPods Pro are among our favorite earbuds. This Beats pair has the same active noise-canceling, transparency tech for hearing external sound, and an H1 chip for fast-pairing with Apple devices. But its battery life is longer (6 hours) and its wingtip design more secure. It's also better for Android users: The Android Beats app lets you set up one-touch pairing and custom controls. $200; beatsbydre.com</p><p>Mila Smart Air Purifier</p><p>Between Covid-19, wildfires and seasonal allergies, there are many reasons to get an air cleaner. A Wi-Fi-enabled one isn't a must-have, but it is more convenient than an analog, manual-control one. Mila pairs a HEPA filter for trapping airborne particles and viruses with activated carbon for removing odors and chemical fumes. It automatically adjusts fan speed based on readings from its on-device sensors. Burned toast? You'll hear Mila start whirring in the background. A \"Housekeeping Service\" deep cleans while you're away, so your home is fresher upon your return. $349; milacares.com</p><p>Microsoft Surface Pro 8</p><p>Upgrading your current computer to Windows 11 may be a roll of the dice, but starting fresh with a Surface Pro 8 is a sure thing. This year's version of Microsoft's tablet-keyboard combo has a thinner, more modern design, an improved high-resolution display and support for the new Surface Slim Pen 2, with a haptic motor to make it feel like you're writing on paper, not glass. Sadly, the Surface Pro Signature Keyboard and that pen are add-ons that will set you back an extra $280. $1,100 and up; microsoft.com</p><p>Whoop Body Smart Apparel</p><p>Whoop is a screenless fitness tracker popular with serious athletes -- the kind of folks willing to pay an $18-a-month subscription fee for personalized coaching, with training for performance and injury prevention. The new Whoop 4.0 can be worn on the wrist, or embedded in a variety of apparel, from an incredibly comfortable adjustable bra to a pair of lined running shorts. The sensor can detect where it is on the body and track data accordingly. It's wearable tech you'd actually wear. $54 and up; whoop.com</p><p>---</p><p>For more tech gift suggestions, go to wsj.com/tech.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
