  "text": "<p>Richard Waters's article highlights the sizeable investment by technology companies to make “the metaverse” a reality (“Facing the future: Microsoft to blend digital and physical worlds with avatars on Teams”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62d4652f-faec-4ef7-b642-1ae7b4262563\">November 3</a>). </p> <p>It's important to fall in love with the problem, not the solution. Moreover organisations need to have a clear vision of what we want our real world to look like, in order to make the most of the opportunities offered by the virtual one. Venturing into the metaverse can bring both sustainability and social benefits.</p> <p>Following the pandemic, the fundamental human need for connection is one of the top priorities businesses need to address, and as COP26 underscores, it is vital we do this in a sustainable way.</p> <p>Right now, in-person collaboration remains the best way to make the connections that build trust and spark new ideas. Using avatars can seem odd at first, but they are a step on the road to more natural online interactions. </p> <p>They can give that sense of “presence”, allowing users to share eye-contact and see each others' body language, something people afflicted by videocall fatigue have realised is missing.</p> <p>However, the metaverse is not a magic bullet. As we design this next stage of the web we need to take a more sustainable and social view, learning from what hasn't worked with mobile and social platforms in the past. </p> <p>Businesses should explore the metaverse not only for the opportunities it could offer, but for the pressing problems it can help solve.</p> <p><strong>Ed Greig</strong> <br><em>Chief Disruptor, Deloitte,<br>London EC4, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Social network errors can help inform the metaverse' FT.com 10 November.
