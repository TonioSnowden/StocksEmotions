  "title": "Cyber Daily: Making Sense Of Russia's REvil Arrests",
  "text": "<p>Some cybersecurity experts are skeptical that the REvil arrests could be a turning point marking Russia's changed position towards hackers in its jurisdiction. Discussions on cybercriminal forums suggested that the move was politically motivated to ease tensions with the U.S. over Russia's current military activity on its border with Ukraine, said Chris Morgan, a senior cyber threat intelligence analyst at Digital Shadows Ltd. The arrests could also be a warning to other ransomware groups, he said. REvil targeted Colonial, as well as meatpacker JBS SA last June and tech company Kaseya Ltd. in July. \"A very public series of raids could be interpreted by some as a message to be mindful of their targeting,\" Mr. Morgan said.</p><p>Following the takedown of REvil, Russia may ask the U.S. for cooperation on other law enforcement issues, said Stefan Soesanto, senior cyber defense researcher at the Center for Security Studies at ETH Zürich university. \"If the response is negative or doesn't yield any reciprocal results over time, then this could be the last ransomware takedown in Russia for a while,\" he said.</p><p>Continued below.</p><p>How well do you know your own network?</p><p>Any company that does business online is vulnerable to cyberattacks. Protecting yourself comes down to knowing what your services depend on, and then using threat intelligence to enhance your defense.</p><p>Read More</p><p>Russian authorities announced Friday that they raided one of the most prominent ransomware gangs, known as REvil, arrested 14 of its members and halted the group's operations at the request of the U.S. government.</p><p>\"These are very important steps, in that they represent the Kremlin taking action against criminals operating from within its borders, and they represent what we're looking for with regard to continued activities like these in the future,\" a senior U.S. government official said in a call with reporters Friday evening.</p><p>Russia's Federal Security Service, or FSB, said in a statement that it also seized millions in cash, luxury cars and cryptocurrency wallets in the raids, which took place across several Russian cities. Russian news agency TASS later released a video of part of the bust.</p><p>What is REvil?</p><p>REvil is a major ransomware-as-a-service operator, which provides malware to affiliates who then launch attacks, in exchange for a cut of the ransom. The group, whose members are believed to be based in Russia and Eastern European nations, is responsible for a number of high-profile attacks in recent years, according to U.S. authorities, including ransomware attacks on meatpacker JBS SA in June 2021, and technology provider Kaseya Ltd. in July. The group has also been known by other names, such as Sodinokibi.</p><p>What is the significance of these arrests?</p><p>The FSB operation is one of the first major publicly disclosed Russian law-enforcement actions against cybercriminal gangs.</p><p>The U.S., which posted a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest of senior REvil figures, and international allies have also conducted operations against REvil in recent months. Authorities in Poland and Romania have arrested suspected members and affiliates through August and November, and the group's infrastructure disappeared from the internet in July, only to briefly reappear and then disappear again in October.</p><p>Read the full story.</p><p>More Cyber News</p><p>Ukraine hit by massive cyberattack. The websites of several Ukrainian ministries, including the Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of Science, were hacked as Russian troops increase their presence around Ukraine's borders. A message posted on the Foreign Ministry's website in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish suggested that users' data was compromised and uploaded online, although no evidence was posted. A group of Ukrainian experts said Russia was likely behind the attack. The U.S., its allies and Russia held talks last week in an attempt to escalate tensions, but there was no breakthrough. U.S. officials have warned some companies that Moscow could retaliate if the Biden administration seeks to punish Russia for invading Ukraine. (WSJ)</p><p>Hackers test the waters. Cybersecurity experts said the website attack could be setting the stage for more destructive hacking against critical infrastructure. Russia has repeatedly rejected hacking allegations from Ukraine and other countries. (Reuters)</p><p>Dangerous malware. Microsoft's researchers detected signs of a destructive malware campaign against organizations in Ukraine. The malware infected computers and tried to pass itself off as ransomware, but didn't have a system for retrieving ransom payments. The malware appeared to be designed to be destructive, instead of ransomware that is designed to obtain payment. Microsoft said government agencies, non-profit and technology organizations were affected. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency circulated an alert advising companies to read Microsoft's blog and look out for signs of the attack.

Europol said police from Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Latvia, Ukraine, the U.S. and the U.K. took down the 15 servers that hosted VPNLab.net. The service provided online anonymity and a double VPN with servers in many countries, which made it popular among cybercriminals seeking to avoid law enforcement authorities' detection. Investigators noticed criminals using VPNLab.net for malware distribution and ransomware campaigns, and saw it advertised on the dark web. (Europol)</p><p>Espionage campaign targets renewable energy. A cybersecurity researcher discovered a large-scale cyber-espionage campaign that has been targeting renewable energy and industrial tech firms since at least 2019, using phishing attempts to steal credentials from employees. Attackers used phishing attempts against companies in the U.S., Asia and Europe. The researcher noticed that the same infrastructure used in the phishing attacks was used to target several Bulgarian banks in 2019. (Bleeping Computer)</p><p>CISA seeks senior threat hunter. CISA published a job listing for associate director for threat hunting with a salary range of $187,000-$246,000. Jen Easterly, the agency's director, posted on LinkedIn that the salary is \"pretty good for the government.\" The associate director for threat hunting will lead a team \"focused on identifying and tracking significant cyber threats, proactively hunting for malicious cyber activity,\" and working in other areas such as incident response.

The United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee is urging Team USA athletes to use \"burner\" or disposable phones because of surveillance risks during the Olympic games that start on Feb. 4. A bulletin that the committee wrote in December said to plan that \"every device, communication, transaction and online activity may be monitored. Your device(s) may also be compromised with malicious software, which could negatively impact future use.\"</p><p>The Canadian Olympic Committee also advised athletes to consider leaving personal devices at home and to limit personal information stored on any devices they bring to Beijing. The U.K. and Dutch committees also advised their delegations to take precautions. (WSJ)</p><p>U.K. plans publicity campaign against encryption. The British Home Office hired advertising agency M&amp;C Saatchi for a campaign against Facebook's plan to encrypt the Messenger app. A Home Office spokesperson confirmed that the advertising agency will work on the campaign. The campaign focuses on how improving encryption would deter efforts to stop child exploitation online. One presentation from the ad agency refers to messaging platforms that already use end-to-end encryption, including WhatsApp, but opposes extending the technology. A slide from the agency says the campaign \"must not start a privacy vs safety debate.\" Documents refer to a media campaign, efforts from law enforcement agencies and charities, and calls for the public to contact tech companies directly. (Rolling Stone)</p><p>Former DHS official charged with stealing employee data. A former Department of Homeland Security acting inspector general pleaded guilty to stealing databases from the government containing employees' personal data. The former official left DHS in 2015 and founded his own company, then stole software and sensitive databases from the department so his company could develop a case management system and offer it for sale to government agencies. Two other defendants allegedly stole copies of database files containing personal data from around 246,167 DHS employees and 6,723 U.S. Postal Service employees. (Bleeping Computer)</p><p>Big tech companies brace for new regulations. New laws under discussion in Europe, Asia and the U.S. could upend competition rules for big tech companies and restrict their use of facial recognition and artificial intelligence. Regulators are also considering limitations to transatlantic data flows and digital advertising. Companies are changing their practices in response to legal changes. In November, Facebook announced it would shut down its facial-recognition system in part because of upcoming regulations.
