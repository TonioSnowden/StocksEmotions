  "title": "McDonald's Plans for Broader Economic Downturn; Burger giant's sales growth hit by strong dollar; company beats earnings expectations for latest quarter",
  "text": "<p>McDonald's Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said the company's business was strong despite broader economic concerns. \"There is increasing uncertainty and unease about the economic environment,\" Mr. Kempczinski said during an investor call Thursday.</p><p>McDonald's shares rose 3.16% to $264.72 in morning trading.</p><p>Some businesses are planning for a slowdown in the U.S. economy, with a number of companies slashing head count to try to shore up their balance sheets. New data Thursday showed the economy grew during the third quarter, but consumer spending cooled from July to September compared with the previous quarter.</p><p>The burger chain said it expects increasing costs for food, materials and labor next year.</p><p>Mr. Kempczinski said the company is planning for a mild to moderate recession in the U.S., and a potentially deeper and longer downturn in Europe.</p><p>\"We are seeing consumer sentiment in Europe remain low,\" Mr. Kempczinski said.</p><p>McDonald's said higher costs for energy, food and paper have particularly hurt its European franchisees, and it is prepared to back owners there with company funds on a limited basis. McDonald's provided cash to franchisees temporarily after the Covid-19 pandemic first hit to prop up owners experiencing sales losses.</p><p>Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CEO Brian Niccol said Tuesday he expected a broader slowdown in consumer demand in the coming year, and though it has raised prices, the chain is promoting the restaurant brand's value.</p><p>McDonald's said marketing featuring the company's core menu helped generate sales and bring in more orders in the U.S. during the quarter. The chain's Cactus Plant Flea Market Box, a Happy Meal geared toward adults, helped U.S. sales in the current quarter, with half of the toys selling out within days of its debut, the company said.</p><p>Price increases also helped the company's revenue. U.S. menu prices were up 10% on average in the third quarter compared with last year, McDonald's said. The company said it is trying to increase prices while still remaining a good value to customers seeking affordable meals. It said restaurants are also benefiting from prices rising faster at supermarkets than at eateries.</p><p>For the third quarter, the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar hurt McDonald's global revenue, despite higher menu prices and promotions helping to drive U.S. sales.</p><p>The burger giant reported total sales of $5.87 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, down 5% compared with the same period last year, though above the expectations of analysts polled by FactSet. McDonald's said its third-quarter revenue was up 2% compared with the same period in 2021 when accounting for the effects of currency fluctuations.</p><p>McDonald's reported earnings of $2.68 per share on income of $1.98 billion, which fell 8% from the prior year's period. Per-share earnings were flat during the third quarter compared with the same period last year when accounting for foreign currencies, the company said. The results beat analysts' earnings expectations for the quarter.</p><p>An increasing number of U.S. companies are reporting lower quarterly sales as the strong dollar depresses the value of revenue generated in foreign markets. For U.S. companies operating overseas, sales in euros, yen, British pounds and other currencies are worth less in dollars now because of shifting exchange rates.</p><p>McDonald's, which owns many of its restaurants in Europe and Australia, said the weakening of the euro, British pound and Australian dollar impacted the value of its sales. The company said it takes steps to mitigate the impact of currency shifts, such as buying goods in local currencies.</p><p>McDonald's said its exit from its Russian business led to a pretax charge of $1.28 billion for the nine months ended Sept. 30, while the sale of its Dynamic Yield technology system generated a $271 million gain.</p><p>The company said it expects its interest expenses this year to increase by roughly 2% because of interest-rate increases.</p><p>Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com</p><p>McDonald's Plans for Broader Economic Downturn</p>",
