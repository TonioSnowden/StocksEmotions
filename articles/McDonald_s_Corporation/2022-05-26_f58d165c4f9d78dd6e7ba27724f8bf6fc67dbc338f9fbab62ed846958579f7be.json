  "text": "<p>Mr. Icahn also attempted to enlist in his campaign the usual suspects among giant asset managers, who have lately seemed determined to seize every opportunity to signal progressive virtue. But the refreshing message in the vote tally is that they seem to have decided to sit this one out. McDonald's announces in a press release today:</p><p>The preliminary results . . . indicate that Mr. Icahn's two nominees received approximately 1% of the Company's outstanding shares and were not elected to the McDonald's Board.</p><p>Even the proxy advisory duopoly, which generally delights in promoting trendy corporate governance ideas, has been sounding downright sensible in responding to Mr. Icahn's emotional appeal. Earlier this month a McDonald's press release quoted advisory firm Glass, Lewis &amp; Co.:</p><p>\"After review, we do not see any evidence to suggest the Company's practice of housing pregnant sows in the initial phase of pregnancy represents a substantial deviation from current industry practice.\"</p><p>\" . . . we believe Management Nominees . . . have vastly superior qualifications and depth of experience compared to those of Dissident Nominees . . .\"</p><p>\" . . . we believe the Dissident's campaign takes on a decidedly simplistic and myopic view of [Environmental, Social and Governance] concerns, with no substantive regard given to the economics of the Company's business nor to the creation of shareholder value. Further, we believe the Dissident Nominees lack the requisite background, qualifications and experience for serving on the board of a large multinational firm such as the Company.\"</p><p>Hiring experienced directors focused on the health of the business and the creation of shareholder valueâ€”what an intriguing idea! Could the misbegotten fad of \"stakeholder\" capitalismfinally be going out of style?</p><p>Another recent McDonald's release quotedthe other big proxy advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services:</p><p>\" . . . the prevailing scientific evidence [regarding sow welfare], along with the realities of commercial-scale agriculture, seem to suggest that there is a reasonable basis for the view espoused by [McDonald's] board.\"</p><p>\" . . . we are hesitant to support a proxy contest predicated on ESG issues in instances where the dissident is economically divorced from the potential impact of its proposals on the company's financial performance.\"</p><p>\"In assessing this campaign, shareholders may want to consider that the board, which has overseen strong performance since the pandemic, is also dealing with developments in Ukraine, which have had a material impact on the company (MCD announced it would temporarily close its more than 800 restaurants in Russia in March).\"</p><p>Oh right, there are a few challenges in the world right now that might require board attention. McDonald's recently announced it is exiting the Russian market entirely.</p><p>Perhaps there's nothing like the threat of a bear market or a recession to focus the mind on what really matters to a business: serving customers, not narrow social agendas.</p><p>The outcome of today's vote is no surprise to Journal readers who saw this week's report from Cara Lombardo and Dana Cimilluca.</p><p>And it probably won't be the last such vote in which activists attempt to force the middle-class consumer to pay for their pet causes. Prior to Thursday's annual shareholders meeting, Ben Miller of the Chicago Business Journal reported on a separate attempt to push the fast-food chain in a vegetarian direction:</p><p>PETA representatives said they plan to grill executives of the Chicago burger giant . . . about the lack of plant-based burgers offered at McDonald's and will ask why the new vegan McPlant burger was advertised and promoted heavily in Europe but not in the United States.</p><p>Mary Robles of PETA said she plans to ask the following question at the meeting: \"When will McDonald's get serious about this issue and launch a McPlant trial nationwide with a robust advertising and marketing campaign?\"</p><p>Just a thought, but perhaps changes in the McDonald's menu should occur in response to customer demand.</p><p>The issue is not just one of cost, important as it is to family budgets in a time of high inflation. If we are tallying votes, how many kids in the back of American minivans are screaming for McPlants?</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.)</p><p>Affordable Breakfast Wins in a Landslide</p>",
