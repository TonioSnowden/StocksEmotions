  "title": "The McFlurry Machine Is Broken (Again). Now the FTC Is On It. --- Malfunctioning of device at McDonald's gets the antitrust agency involved",
  "text": "<p>Late-night TV comics joke about the problem. Rivals Jack in the Box Inc. and Wendy's Co. have roasted McDonald's for it on social media. An online tracker called McBroken monitors McDonald's ice cream machine outages across cities.</p><p>Enter the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC reached out to McDonald's franchisees this summer seeking information on what, exactly, is going on with the broken ice cream machine problem, according to a letter it sent, viewed by The Wall Street Journal, and people familiar with the matter. The FTC declined to comment.</p><p>For McDonald's devotees, not to mention the company, a dysfunctional ice cream dispenser is no small matter. The shiny metal machines crank out concoctions that account for about 60% of the chain's dessert sales in the U.S., according to a consumer survey by research firm Technomic.</p><p>The machines require a nightly automated heat-cleaning cycle that can last up to four hours to destroy bacteria. The cleaning can fail, making the machines unusable until a repair tech can get them.</p><p>McDonald's said it understands the frustrations and has a team to working on it. It said it is introducing solutions including new training for crew members. It also has tried to add levity to the situation. \"We have a joke about our soft serve machine but are worried it won't work,\" McDonald's tweeted last year.</p><p>The National Owners Association, a franchisee group, said in a May message: \"We are tired of being the butt of late night jokes. So are our customers and crews.\"</p><p>Some owners have paid to train their staff to fix the machines. Others have contacted their primary manufacturer, Taylor Commercial Foodservice LLC.</p><p>\"A lot of what's been broadcasted can be attributed to the lack of knowledge about the equipment and how they operate in the restaurants,\" a Taylor representative said. \"The machines are built up with a lot of interconnecting parts that have to operate in a complex environment. . . .\"</p><p>Two years ago, a firm called Kytch Inc. began offering a device to mount on the machines to alert owners about a breakdown. It sends real-time text and email alerts that can prevent damage, the firm says.</p><p>One selling point: Its warnings are in clear English. The Taylor machines' own user messages, according to Kytch, are on the order of: \"ERROR: XSndhUIF LHPR&gt;45F 1HR LPROD too VISC.\"</p><p>Taylor said an explanation of error codes is in machine manuals. \"There is no reason for us to purposely design our equipment to be confusing or hard to repair or hurt our operators,\" the Taylor representative said.</p><p>McDonald's told franchisees late last year the devices aren't sanctioned and said they potentially pose a safety hazard, which Kytch denies. McDonald's said it is developing its own smart device.</p><p>\"Nothing is more important to us than delivering on our high standards for food quality and safety,\" it said, \"which is why we work with fully vetted partners that can reliably provide safe solutions.\"</p><p>Kytch in May filed a lawsuit accusing Taylor, a repair company authorized to work on Taylor machines and a McDonald's franchisee of conspiring to replicate Kytch's technology. The pending complaint alleged Taylor gained access to Kytch's device after the franchisee brought his machine to the repair company with the device mounted on it.</p><p>\"This is a case about corporate espionage and the extreme steps one manufacturer has taken to conceal and protect a multimillion-dollar repair racket,\" attorneys for Kytch wrote in the complaint in California Superior Court in Alameda County.</p><p>Taylor denied it had a copy of Kytch's device or sought to steal technology, saying in a court filing: \"This is a case of a hacker -- Kytch -- incredibly accusing the hacked -- Taylor -- of theft.\"</p><p>The franchisee, Jonathan Tyler Gamble, said he was a Kytch fan and wasn't after its intellectual property. \"I supported and encouraged it being approved by McDonald's,\" he wrote in a legal response.</p><p>In an interview, Kytch co-founder Jeremy O'Sullivan accused Taylor of infringing on McDonald's franchisees' rights to alter and repair their shake machines as they see fit.</p><p>Taylor said it doesn't infringe. It said that owners are allowed to repair equipment as they see fit, but that the warranty isn't valid if they fix machines on their own.</p><p>The FTC letters went out early this summer, according to franchisees. The Biden administration is scrutinizing a range of products, from phones to tractors, on whether manufacturers impede owners from fixing the products themselves. In July, the FTC said it would investigate device-repair restrictions.</p><p>The FTC wants to know how McDonald's reviews suppliers and equipment, including the ice cream machines, and how often restaurant owners are allowed to work on their own machines, according to a person familiar with FTC conversations with franchisees.</p><p>The FTC inquiry is preliminary, and \"the existence of a preliminary investigation does not indicate the FTC or its staff have found any wrongdoing,\" the agency's letter said.</p><p>Taylor said it hadn't been contacted by the FTC. Kytch said that it hadn't, either. McDonald's said it had no reason to believe it was a focus of an FTC investigation.</p><p>In the meantime, McDonald's customers say they continue to wait on their shake or McFlurry. Jim Lewis, a McDonald's restaurant owner in New York for 32 years until he retired in 2019, said, \"The ice cream machine \"was so over-engineered it was silly. Sometimes simple is just better.\"</p>",
