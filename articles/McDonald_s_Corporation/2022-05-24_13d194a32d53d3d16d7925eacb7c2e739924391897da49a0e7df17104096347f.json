  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis: Starbucks to Leave Russia",
  "text": "<p>Starbucks said nearly 2,000 employees in Russia would continue to be paid for six months and receive help finding jobs outside of the chain. The company declined to comment on the financial impact of closing its Russian market, which accounts for a relatively small portion of its sales. The Seattle-based company had included Russia among the countries it targeted for growth about a decade ago, though the number of stores in the country had trickled down since the pandemic hit.</p><p>\"One thing that we're very proud of is we're continuing to pay our partners in Russia,\" Chief Executive Howard Schultz said, referring to the company's employees.</p><p>Western companies have been under pressure to pull the plug on their operations in Russia since the country invaded Ukraine in late February. Sanctions from Western governments have also made it harder for U.S. firms to continue doing business in the country.</p><p>In recent months, companies have exited or signaled their intention to further pull back from Russia.</p><p>McDonald's Corp. last week said it was selling its Russian business, ending more than three decades in the country. The company had 847 restaurants and employed 62,000 people there, and McDonald's is now working to sell its Russian business to Alexander Govor, a McDonald's licensee since 2015 who operates 25 restaurants in Siberia. McDonald's said it expected to record an accounting charge of between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion and recognize a significant foreign-currency translation loss.</p><p>The burger chain directly owned most of its Russian restaurants, unlike Starbucks, which ran its business there through a licensee. Kuwait-based M.H. Alshaya Co. also operates Starbucks stores in North Africa and the Middle East. Starbucks ships its coffee and other products to its licensees to run in specific markets. An Alshaya spokesman declined to comment.</p><p>Other companies leaving Russia include French auto maker Renault SA, which reached a deal to cede its 68% stake in Russia's biggest car maker, AvtoVAZ, to a state-backed entity, though it kept an option to take back some of its assets in a few years. Oil major Shell PLC has been exiting from its Russian businesses in phases.</p><p>Marriott International Inc. CEO Anthony Capuano said in an interview on Monday that the hotel chain holds weekly calls and regularly discusses the viability of operating in Russia. Marriott has 23 operating hotels in the country, with six others no longer in its system following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>",
