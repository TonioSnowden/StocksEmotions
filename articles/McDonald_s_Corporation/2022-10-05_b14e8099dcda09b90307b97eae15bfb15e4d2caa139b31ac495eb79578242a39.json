  "title": "Mint Chocolate on Fried Chicken? A Food Craze Has Everyone Taking Sides; Even BTS band members divide over the latest flavor taking over South Korea",
  "text": "<p>\"When it comes to mint-chocolate food, I like to try them out, whatever it may be,\" said Mr. Kang, a 33-year-old who works in the security sector in Seoul. \"I usually like them, too.\"</p><p>South Korea is drowning in mint chocolate, creating a gooey divide in a country unusually fond of fresh flavors. Beyond desserts, mint chocolate is getting piled onto burgers, stirred into rice cakes and stuffed into steamed buns. Diehards can lather themselves with mint-chocolate soap or brush their teeth with mint-chocolate toothpaste. Fast-food chain KFC, with local delivery app Baedal Minjok, recently ran a monthlong promotion offering a mint-chocolate dipping sauce for its fried chicken.</p><p>Unconventional food pairings of all sorts have given heartburn to diners worldwide (consider the Hawaiian pizza). But South Koreans can be especially game to try new flavors and food combinations, which are often discussed first in online communities, flagged by celebrities and then spread across social media, said Park Sung-hee, of the Korea Trend Research Institute.</p><p>Global fast-food brands in South Korea have tested menu items such as a honey-butter soybean powder seasoning for french fries at McDonald's and Shake Shack's burger featuring fried chicken marinated in gochujang hot-chili sauce. Burger King said that out of all the markets it operates in, it develops the largest number of new menu items for South Korea. The chain chose the country to unveil special versions of its multi-patty Stacker Whopper, including one featuring Guinness beer-flavored sauce and another with peanut-butter sauce.</p><p>\"South Korean consumers tend to always be curious about new tastes,\" said Kim Jun, who heads marketing at South Korea's SPC Group for the country's chain of Baskin-Robbins stores. The ice cream brand recently had sweet corn as the special flavor of the month.</p><p>When it comes to mint-chocolate dishes, not everyone is green with envy. \"I don't agree with the current hype,\" said Jung Min-kyu, a 30-year-old freelance translator in Seoul. \"It reminds me of toothpaste.\"</p><p>The flavor's proliferation has celebrities and other notable figures taking sides. South Korea's president, Yoon Suk-yeol, confessed to being a mint-chocolate fan on social media before taking office in May. He still enjoys mint chocolate, his office said in a written statement.</p><p>Various members of the boy band BTS have professed their likeâ€”or dislike. The group's management firm, HYBE Co., confirmed that three enjoy the flavor, while four aren't fans.</p><p>The K-pop star IU, whose real name is Lee Ji-eun, has publicly professed her love of mint chocolate. But asked by a fan in an online segment with the fashion magazine Elle Korea if she enjoyed mint chocolate in steamed buns, the singer marveled that such an item even existed. She said she recently realized that she is actually just a middling fan of the flavor, and draws the line at ice cream.</p><p>\"It depends on the temperature,\" she said in the segment. \"I would like to just make that clear. I'm sorry.\"</p><p>South Korea's most impassioned fans have banded together in a Team Mint Chocolate group, whose Instagram page counts roughly 26,000 followers online.</p><p>The group is run by WithGo, a Seoul-based food brand that sells mint-chocolate-themed T-shirts, posters, protein balls, soap and hand cream on its website, among other items. The group plans to soon hold its first offline event, a mint-chocolate festival, and has cast its loyalists as outsiders. A question the group frequently gets from aspiring members is: \"Am I weird for liking mint chocolate?\" said Youn Su-mi, a WithGo product manager.</p><p>\"We're letting the world know that there are lots of us who enjoy mint chocolate,\" she said.</p><p>Kim Min-che, a 32-year-old designer living in the city of Daejeon, supports Team Mint Chocolate. She regularly purchases their mint-chocolate milk and protein balls, and owns team badges as well as stickers that now decorate the back of her iPad. \"Through the group, we can collectively express our love for the flavor,\" Ms. Kim said.</p><p>Kim Seok-june is a fan of mint-chocolate sweets. He was less fond of KFC's mint-chocolate dipping sauce, which he tried with a few colleagues shortly after the promotion started in July. The 34-year-old editor at a Seoul-based magazine polished off the chicken, but left the teal sauce all but untouched. The group's collective verdict: The flavor was like brushing your teeth while eating chicken.</p><p>\"I didn't have high expectations going in. And upon trying it, alas, it tasted bad,\" said Mr. Kim.</p><p>Despite enjoying mint chocolate in shakes and iced drinks, 26-year-old Nam Ki-yeon found the combo with chicken a challenge to his taste buds. \"I wasn't sure if this should be allowed,\" he said.</p><p>KFC's Korea office said some consumers have logged requests through the company's website for the dipping sauce to become permanent, though there are no such plans.</p><p>\"I'd for sure eat it all the time if it was available,\" said Kim Jin-seok, a 31-year-old electronics-industry researcher in Daejeon.</p><p>In other options, the country's ubiquitous rice liquor, soju, now has a mint-chocolate version. A typically bright-red plate of spicy rice cakes known as tteokbokki is a shade of turquoise in its mint-chocolate transformation. A hamburger brand offered a limited-edition burger stuffed with mint-chocolate sauce and Oreos in a special event.</p><p>Cho Hyun-jung, a 35-year-old medical industry worker in Incheon, enjoys a variety of mint-chocolate treats, including protein shakes, buns and sweet rice cakes. She also washes her hands with teal-colored soap scented with mint chocolate.</p><p>The refreshing scent cheers her up, Ms. Cho said. The bars of soap look a bit like treats themselves, adding to the allure. \"I'd sometimes like to take a bite of them,\" she said.</p><p>Write to Jiyoung Sohn at jiyoung.sohn@wsj.com</p><p>Mint Chocolate on Fried Chicken?
