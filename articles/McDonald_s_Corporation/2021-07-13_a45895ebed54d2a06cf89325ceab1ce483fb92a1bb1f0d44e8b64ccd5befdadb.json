  "text": "<p>Labor has emerged as one of the biggest challenges to the U.S. economy's post-pandemic rebound, particularly in service-heavy businesses that depend on large numbers of workers to prepare meals or make beds. Restaurants last year made some of the largest layoffs, as Covid-19 prompted shutdowns and restrictions, and the industry now is struggling to bring back workers and find new ones. Restaurant and bar employment remains 1.3 million workers lower than since the pandemic began spreading in the U.S., while other sectors have nearly returned to full employment.</p><p>Many restaurant workers left the industry last year for other jobs, and the sector currently has one of the highest rates of employees quitting. The rate of U.S. restaurant and hotel workers leaving their jobs hit a two-decade high in April and remained there in May, according to the Labor Department.</p><p>McDonald's is one of the largest U.S. private employers with 800,000 people, working in the chain's restaurants.</p>",
