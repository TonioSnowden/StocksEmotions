  "text": "<p>A word of warning to anyone visiting Reykjavik — do not walk around the Icelandic capital in the company of artist Ragnar Kjartansson. Most people stop local luminary Kjartansson, who is unstintingly friendly to all passers-by. </p> <p>Just over 360,000 people live on the close-knit Nordic island and such encounters give the impression of a big fish in a small pond, which could lead to delusions of grandeur. But Kjartansson is a grounded, clever practitioner whose maverick, humane pieces have crept into the public consciousness. “The Visitors”, a 2012 installation and video piece featuring a group of musicians strumming and ruminating on life at Rokeby (a historic estate in New York State's Hudson Valley), has been critically acclaimed worldwide.</p> <p>Another memorable piece is “Me and My Mother” — a 2015 <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/130528262\">video</a> work not for the faint-hearted — which shows Kjartansson standing with his mother, the actor Gudrun Asmundsdottir, while she repeatedly spits on him in a film as gross as it is riveting. “There's this really interesting reverse psychology. It's [the saliva] over your face in tiny flakes, and the smell is . . . you know?” he says. The work is updated every five years (the latest instalment was shot last year).</p> <p>His revelations flow freely during a meeting in his compact, cosy studio located near the harbour. Our chat, scheduled for an hour, turns instead into a three-hour conversation — he is wearing an immaculate tweed suit — that shoots off in innumerable directions. Kjartansson's happiness about the recent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b54e81f0-e708-4a04-826b-935f642b78bd\">Abba reunion</a>, for instance, is palpable, segueing into stories of escapist times spent shepherding in the hills outside Reykjavik. </p> <p>Kjartansson's latest project may well be his boldest to date. The 46-year-old is re-creating the 1980s US daytime soap&#xa0;<em>Santa Barbara</em>&#xa0;for a new project due to be unveiled at GES-2, the vast new culture complex in Moscow founded by the billionaire Leonid Mikhelson.</p> <p>The historic 20,000 sq m venue, home to Mikhelson's philanthropic V-A-C Foundation, opens early in December. A former power plant built in 1907, it was converted by the Italian architect <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f70d4f4-d136-45fb-8dac-0376d2715517\">Renzo Piano</a>, and could become as important on the global art circuit as London's Tate Modern or the Centre Pompidou in Paris.</p> <p>A professional film crew led&#xa0;by&#xa0;director Asa Helga Hjorleifsdottir will stage and shoot almost 100&#xa0;episodes of <em>Santa Barbara</em> at GES-2, performed in Russian by some of the country's most accomplished actors. <em>Santa Barbara</em> was highly significant for a generation of Russians. It was the first American soap to be shown in the country — it first aired on the official state network RTR on January 2 1992 — after the Soviet Union collapsed and the hammer and sickle was lowered over the Kremlin. </p> <p>“Myth has it Soviet Russians were playing chess, watching TV shows about engineering and&#xa0;reading poetry to each other&#xa0;and then suddenly <em>Santa Barbara</em> arrived and everything changed,” Kjartansson says. “The&#xa0;piece is a recreation of that national and global shakedown.”</p> <p>The sets, costumes and props of&#xa0;each episode duplicate those used in&#xa0;the original serial, with a distinct DIY aesthetic underpinning the 2021 version, he says. Creating an episode a day in front of live audiences, each scene will be filmed in just one take and footage edited daily. The impression will be of a working set, a mass of activity with hair, make-up and cameramen in full flow, bringing to a life a “kind of&#xa0;large-scale historical painting that turns into a&#xa0;live performative sculpture”, says a V-A-C statement. </p> <p>Teresa Iarocci Mavica, the director of the foundation, says GES-2 will investigate “Russia's story over the past 30 years”, with <em>Santa Barbara</em> at the core of this programme. “At the beginning of the 1990s, <em>Santa Barbara</em> introduced new role models, values and ideas that had an undeniable impact on Russian society, and we are interested in understanding which of these remain today,” she adds. </p> <p>In the US publication Foreign Policy, writer <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/07/24/american-soap-opera-explains-how-russia-feels-about-everything-santa-barbara-trump-putin/\">Mikhail Iossel</a> provides expert analysis on the soap's impact, outlining why <em>Santa Barbara</em>, the cheesiest of dramas, provided perfect escapism “through the crime-ridden, chaotic 1990s, the early post-Soviet years of timelessness and hardship”.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Life in metropolises, small towns, industrial settlements and snowbound villages across Russia's 11 time zones would come to a standstill as the cheery sounds of&#xa0;<em>Santa Barbara</em>'s intro rang out from millions of TV sets, Iossel says. Streets, bars, restaurants and clothing stores were named after the TV show, reflecting the aspirational vision of nirvana dished up by the Californian serial.</p> <p>Kjartansson visited Russia in 1997 and describes falling “deeply in love” with the country. He even considered applying to a&#xa0;St Petersburg art academy in a bid to become a “historic painter” (red tape and reality got in the way though). His GES-2 enterprise has other touchstones. The opening group show, which includes a range of important international artists, is entitled “<a href=\"https://v-a-c.org/en/ges2/to-moscow-to-moscow-to-moscow\">To Moscow! To Moscow! To Moscow!</a>”, echoing the lament of Anton Chekhov's <em>Three Sisters. </em>From the late US stage director Jay Ranelli, Kjartansson had heard the poignant story of a visit to McDonald's in Moscow, where Ranelli had spotted three servers sporting the name tags of Irina, Masha and Olga, the characters in Chekhov's play<em>. </em></p> <p>Kjartansson was inspired to re-create the scenario for his GES-2 initiative. Against a vast replica of the Russian McDonald's branch, which dominates his studio, he photographed three women who represent Chekhov's epochal siblings. The picture — all 1980s big hair and happy customer service in the communist heartland — is strangely moving and evocative. </p> <p>At GES-2, Kjartansson will also show an inflammatory two-channel video re-creating the moments when Russia's most controversial painting, “Ivan the Terrible and his son Ivan on November 16 1581”, by Ilya Repin, was attacked twice, in 1913 and in 2018, “for&#xa0;ambiguous&#xa0;religious and nationalistic reasons”, he says.</p> <p>We discuss how working in Russia sits with his progressive values. He is “appalled” at the country's poor record on LGBTQ+ rights but says “it's also important to remember that not every one of Moscow's 12.5m residents is Putin. And, of course, there is something artistically thrilling about making a show in Russia.”</p> <p>If a Proustian element of nostalgia may be ignited in Russians of a certain age who watched <em>Santa Barbara, </em>Kjartansson's take on the show's contemporary resonance is key, arguing that, in some ways, this American soap opera belongs to Russian more than American culture. </p> <p>“And for&#xa0;someone living on an island right between Moscow and Washington DC, feeling the&#xa0;cold war brewing again in the air, there is something weirdly healing about&#xa0;seeing&#xa0;Russian actors pretending to be&#xa0;Americans,” he says, applying a logic that reflects Kjartansson to the core.</p> <p><em>December 4-March 13, &#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://v-a-c.org/en/ges2/ragnar-kjartansson-extended-performance-santa-barbara\"><em>v-a-c.org</em></a>&#xa0;</p> <p><em>Follow&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em>&#xa0;on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p>&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;<p>Source: Gareth Harris 2021 'Artist Ragnar Kjartansson — Santa Barbara and a Russian revolution ' FT.com 9 November.
