  "text": "<p>Presto has branded itself as a practical solution for restaurants wanting to minimize human interactions during the coronavirus pandemic. It also says it can help address the human-labor shortage in the industry, with many workers electing not to return to service-sector jobs.</p><p>Several restaurants use Presto, including McDonald's Corp., Applebee's and Chili's.</p><p>The Redwood City, Calif., firm is close to a deal with the SPAC Ventoux CCM Acquisition Corp., a blank-check company focused on the leisure and hospitality industries, the people said. The merger could be announced as soon as this week.</p><p>Presto would join several other technology startups that are working to disrupt industries from manufacturing to advertising in going public by combining with a SPAC. Such mergers have become popular alternatives to traditional initial public offerings, in part because they let the company going public make business projections while raising a large sum of cash.</p><p>As part of the deal, Presto is expected to raise a roughly $70 million private investment in public equity, or PIPE, the people said. PIPE investors are expected to include some of the restaurant franchises that use Presto, they said.</p><p>The Ventoux CCM SPAC has about $170 million and is led by several former hospitality executives. It also is backed by investment bank Chardan Capital Markets LLC.</p><p>Also called a blank-check company, a SPAC is a shell company that raises money, then trades on a stock exchange with the sole intent of merging with a private company to take it public. After a deal is announced, the company going public releases detailed financial information that is reviewed by regulators. Once the deal is approved and closes, the private firm replaces the SPAC in the stock market.</p><p>Before deals go through, SPAC investors have the right to withdraw their money. Low share prices often motivate them to do so. High withdrawals can dramatically reduce the amount of cash the company going public generates and have made it harder to complete deals lately.</p><p>Still, excitement among investors has returned to some SPACs and the companies they take public in recent weeks following a summer slump. Shares of neighborhood social-media app Nextdoor Holdings Inc. have rallied this week after the firm completed its SPAC deal.</p><p>The blank-check firm taking former President Trump's new social-media venture public also has soared recently. Excitement about electric-vehicle startups such as Lucid Group Inc. that combined with SPACs also has powered shares of many of these firms higher.</p><p>Write to Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com</p><p>Restaurant-Tech Startup Presto Nearing $1 Billion SPAC Merger to Go Public</p>",
