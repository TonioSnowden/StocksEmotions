  "text": "<p>Consider restaurants, America's second-largest source of private employment. According to the National Restaurant Association, 110,000 have permanently closed and more than 500,000 are \"in an unprecedented economic decline.\" In November alone, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, restaurants and bars lost 17,400 jobs as new state lockdowns took effect.</p><p>But while national brands lose in lockdown-happy states, many are able to compensate with revenue from their locations in places with minimal restrictions.</p><p>National chains that are known for delivery are actually seeing sales improve. Domino's third-quarter U.S. sales were up 17.5%; Papa John's were up 24%. Quick service chains with drive-through lanes are also benefiting: McDonald's third-quarter U.S. sales rose 4.6%, while Wendy's were up 7.9%.</p><p>Single-location, sit-down eateries have none of these advantages. Those that have scraped by through outdoor dining, delivery and limited indoor seating are now being pushed to the brink by fresh lockdowns and worsening weather.</p><p>My favorite Italian restaurant, Trattoria Mollie in Santa Barbara, Calif., is one such establishment. Mollie is an Ethiopian immigrant who invested everything she had in her restaurant. She never made a fortune, but I've never seen anyone happier running a restaurant, or better at it. Her employees, many of whom are also immigrants, make a good living. Santa Barbara's mild climate has allowed her business to survive on outdoor dining alone.</p><p>That is, until a couple weeks ago when, despite its limited health risks, outdoor dining was banned by Gov. Gavin Newsom. Mollie called me in tears asking for advice; her restaurant was on the brink, and her employees were about to go jobless, unable to feed their families or pay their rent.</p><p>Mollie isn't alone. From the Pineapple Hill Saloon &amp; Grill in Los Angeles to Bread and Barley's in Covina, videos spreading across social media show the increasing desperation and anger of California's independent restaurant community.</p><p>Paycheck Protection Program loans have ameliorated some losses, but even more generous benefits would be insufficient to keep local businesses alive if lockdowns persist. The best stimulus for any business is customers. In many cases, it would only take a little leeway -- all Mollie needs is the restoration of outdoor dining.</p><p>If blue states really want to champion the vulnerable and dispossessed, they should start by letting them feed their families.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Puzder is a former CEO of CKE Restaurants and author of \"The Capitalist Comeback: The Trump Boom and the Left's Plot to Stop It.\"</p>",
