  "title": "McDonald's CEO Apologizes for Text Exchange",
  "text": "<p>\"I am learning from this,\" said Mr. Kempczinski in the message, viewed by The Wall Street Journal. \"I believe that starts with more listening and learning from more people whose life experiences are different from my own.\"</p><p>In an exchange with Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot this past April, Mr. Kempczinski referenced the shooting deaths of two city children, 13-year-old Adam Toledo and 7-year-old Jaslyn Adams. Jaslyn Adams was in a McDonald's drive-through at the time of the shooting.</p><p>An increase in murders that began last year in U.S. cities, including Chicago, is carrying forward into 2021. It has been concentrated in poor neighborhoods, typically Black and Hispanic, with persistent histories of violence. Adam Toledo was shot by Chicago police in a largely Mexican neighborhood on the city's West Side. Jaslyn Adams was shot by a gunman while sitting in a car with her father in North Lawndale, a predominantly Black neighborhood also on the West Side.</p><p>Mr. Kempczinski in the text to Ms. Lightfoot called the shootings \"tragic.\" He then wrote: \"With both, the parents failed those kids which I know is something you can't say. Even harder to fix.\"</p><p>Open records advocates discovered the text exchange in a broader public information request and started sharing it on social media last month. The disclosure prompted protests at the company's Chicago headquarters.</p><p>A spokesman for the mayor's office said Monday: \"As the Mayor has said previously, families do everything they can -- moms, dads, grandparents -- to love and support their children, and tragedies can still happen. Victim shaming has no place in this conversation.\"</p><p>Mr. Kempczinski has apologized in calls and messages in the past week. In a nearly six-minute video recorded at McDonald's headquarters Saturday and sent to U.S. employees, restaurant owners and suppliers, he promised to learn from the incident and meet with the parents whose children had died.</p><p>\"Those comments were wrong, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry I let you down. And I let myself down,\" Mr. Kempczinski said in the video to U.S. employees, operators and suppliers.</p><p>\"I have, through my background, a very narrow world view,\" he said. \"My comments to Mayor Lightfoot revealed that ignorance.\"</p><p>Mr. Kempczinski, who rose to CEO of the burger chain two years ago, was attending the COP26 environmental summit in Glasgow last week when the email exchange with Ms. Lightfoot gained traction on social media. Chicago civic groups and the Service Employees International Union, a labor union seeking to represent McDonald's workers, sent a letter to Mr. Kempczinski demanding an apology and explanation. \"Your text message was ignorant, racist and unacceptable coming from anyone, let alone the CEO of McDonald's,\" they wrote.</p><p>On Monday, the labor union sponsored ads on local television and radio networks asking Mr. Kempczinski to directly meet with workers and city residents by Wednesday.</p><p>Mr. Kempczinski sent a message to employees on Nov. 2 apologizing for the text exchange. Since then, he has spoken with Black franchisees and elected leaders representing U.S. franchisees on at least two calls, where they expressed anger over his comments and he apologized, people familiar with the conversations said. He has also personally spoken to Chicago community leaders and the company's U.S. employees, one of the people said.</p><p>In the video Saturday, Mr. Kempczinski said he aims to read all emails and messages he has been sent expressing opinions on his comments. At times, Mr. Kempczinski's voice broke and he appeared to struggle to get through the video apology, particularly when he mentioned how his daughter had asked why he wrote the text.</p><p>\"In that question, there's a lot. Disappointment. Confusion. And certainly disagreement with the idea and the sentiment that was expressed,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Kempczinski didn't respond to a request for further comment.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
