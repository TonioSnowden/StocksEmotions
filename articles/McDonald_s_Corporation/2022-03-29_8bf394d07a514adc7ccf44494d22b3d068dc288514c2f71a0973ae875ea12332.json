  "text": "<p>Russian attacks on population centers and efforts to encircle Kyiv have driven more than 3½ million people out of Ukraine but the invading forces failed to take control of any major Ukrainian city. Moscow is now refocusing its efforts on expanding control of Russian-speaking areas toward the east of the country. In the international effort to stop Mr. Putin, the U.S. and its European allies are providing military equipment to Ukraine andhave deployed sanctions and other measures to inflict economic pain on the Russian leader. President Biden has pushed for Russia to be expelled from the Group of 20 major economies as he met other leaders to discuss further measures against Moscow. On March 26, he appeared to call for Mr. Putin's ouster during a speech in Poland. \"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power,\" Mr. Biden said, before the White House walked back his comment, saying that the president was referring to Mr. Putin's power over Russia's neighbors.</p><p>While Mr. Putin has acknowledged the economic impact on Russia, he has given no indication he would bow to pressure to end the war. Frequent teleconferences are under way between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, with delegations from the two sides now meeting again in Turkey.</p><p>What does Putin want?</p><p>The Russian leader has said his main objective is to defend the Russian speakers in Ukraine, especially those in the two self-declared republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, which broke away from Ukrainian control in 2014. He called it \"denazification,\" falsely claiming that Kyiv is controlled by American-sponsored neo-Nazis.</p><p>More significantly, Mr. Putin regards Ukraine and Russia as inseparable, \"one people, a single whole,\" and aims to intercept the former Soviet republic's closer integration with the West and its aspiration to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. U.S. officials say that at the least, the Kremlin aims to secure a land bridge between western Russia and the Crimean Peninsula, and expanding Russian control of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin also appears to be trying to force the Ukrainian government to accept neutrality between Russia and the West.</p><p>Mr. Putin has already expanded Moscow's influence over former Soviet republics such as Belarus, Georgia and Moldova, but Ukraine has long been the primary prize, sitting on Russia's western flank, where, historically, it has been most vulnerable to attack.</p><p>The trend among Ukrainians to support closer integration with Europe—and the growing use of the Ukrainian language, instead of Russian—has alarmed the Kremlin. And since the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has become a high-profile champion of Ukrainian sovereignty, with his displays of defiance from Kyiv and steady lobbying of NATO and the international community to help his country stop Mr. Putin. </p><p>A woman wept during the evacuation of Irpin, Ukraine.

Russian forces have faced heavy resistance from Ukrainian troops and volunteers and have turned to shelling residential areas in an apparent effort to force the Ukrainian leadership to relinquish territory to the east and south of the country.</p><p>The second-largest city, Kharkiv, has been badly hit though it is still held by Ukrainians. The southern city of Kherson is under Russian control, the first regional capital to be occupied, but Ukraine said it carried out an airstrike on the city's airport and satellite imagery showed destroyed or damaged Russian helicopters. In the besieged southern city of Mariupol, Russian airstrikes hit a maternity hospital and a theater where hundreds of people had been sheltering in the basement.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has petitioned the West for military aid and repeatedly lashed out at NATO's refusal to implementa no-fly zone over his country to prevent Russian bombardments of civilian areas. Mr. Putin has warned that any action against Russian combat aircraft over Ukraine from the soil of another country would be met with an immediate military response.</p><p>At least four Russian brigadier generals have been killed in Ukraine since the invasion began, Kyiv officials said, a sign of vulnerabilities in Moscow's military tactics.</p><p>Security concerns overthe safety of Ukraine's nuclear plants—includingthe one at Chernobyl, which is now under Russian control and operated by a skeleton crew ofcaptive Ukrainians—are a persistent theme in the war, given the indiscriminate nature of the Russian bombardments.</p><p>How are the people of Ukraine handling the crisis?</p><p>The Russian invasion has driven many Ukrainians to flee the country or to find shelter wherever possible—and prompted others to join the fight.</p><p>Thousands of civilians have been killed, according to Ukrainian officials. In besieged cities such as Mariupol and Chernihiv, so many civilians have died that officials are struggling to recover bodies and count the dead. In Kharkiv, which before the invasion was a city of 1.4 million, residents have moved into the subway as Russian attacks pulverize the city.</p><p>The streets of Kyiv are now mostly empty of residents, with just soldiers and some elderly left behind as Russian forces try to encircle the city. In many cities, those who have remained spend nights in air-raid shelters or preparing to repel the Russian advance. Protests against Russian occupation have emerged in southern cities that have fallen under the control of Russian forces.</p><p>More than 3½ million people have fled Ukraine—with 1½ million children among them—and more than two million are internally displaced, according to the United Nations. In all, more than 10 million people have been uprooted from their homes, according to the United Nations. More than 200,000 Ukrainians have returned home to help defend the country, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has said.</p><p>What are NATO and the West doing in response to Russia?</p><p>NATO allies are bolstering the alliance's eastern flank, which borders Ukraine, deploying jet fighters and ships to the region. President Biden said the U.S. would send an additional $800 million in security assistance to Ukraine, amounting to a total of $1 billion in such assistance. He has also pledged another $1 billion in humanitarian aid. The European Union has set out plans for loans and grants to Ukraine valued at more than $1.3 billion. In Brussels, President Biden met with other NATO leaders on March 24 to agree on new measures to help Ukraine battle Russia's invasion and address growing concerns Moscow might use chemical, biological or other unconventional weapons in its monthlong war.</p><p>During a news conference in Brussels on March 24, Mr. Biden said the use of such weapons would trigger a response from the U.S. and its allies.</p><p>However, NATO isn't planning to enforce a no-fly zone to limit Russian aerial threats, despite pleas from Ukraine.</p><p>The West's primary weapon is to cut Russia off from global financial markets and damage its economy. TheU.S. is also banning imports of Russian oil, the lifeblood of Moscow's economy, as well as Russian natural gas and other energy sources. The EU plans to cutits imports of Russian natural gas by two-thirds by the end of this year, and the U.K. said it would phase out the Russian oil imports. Germany earlier halted the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline.</p><p>What is happening in Russia?</p><p>Tough new sanctions have all-but-unplugged Russia from the global financial system. The measures have brought factory closures, job losses, a doubling of interest rates and a decline of the ruble. \"Our economy will need deep structural changes in these new realities, and I won't hide this—they won't be easy; they will lead to a temporary rise in inflation and unemployment,\" Mr. Putin said. Russia is at risk of defaulting on its debt.</p><p>As the measures came into force, long lines of Russians appeared at banks in Moscow and other cities hoping to withdraw dollars. Economists expect the economy to incur a sizable contraction this year along with double-digit inflation.</p><p>Western companies have pulled out of the country, marking the end of an era of capitalist engagement. Middle-class Russians who had grown used to foreign vacations and access to Western consumer goods are now facing the prospect of spending long winters at home without McDonald's burgers, Starbucks coffee or services such as Netflix and Spotify asWestern brands pull out of the country. The development of energy resources is also under threat as companies such asBP and Shell said they would step back from doing business with Russia.</p><p>Moscow's streets have been crawling with armed security forces to stop protests against the war. Nearly 15,000 Russians have been detained in antiwar rallies, according to OVD-Info, and a highly visible display of dissent came from state television producer Marina Ovsyannikova, who burst onto the set of an evening news program with an antiwar poster.</p><p>Outside Moscow, many Russians support their government's military action in Ukraine and say Russia is being unfairly targeted by the West. It is a view reinforced daily by state television broadcasts and other official media, the main source of information for most Russians. </p><p>Civilians pulled luggage through the snow as they left Irpin, Ukraine.

A new round of in-person discussions began in Turkey on March 29 where Ukraine outlined its conditions for accepting a status as a neutral country, unaligned with the West. Ukrainian negotiators said that their key demands included guarantees for Ukraine's security from the U.S., the U.K., France, Turkey, Germany, Canada, Poland and Israel, similar to the mutual defense agreement that binds NATO. \"This is the system we would like to build the future of Ukraine on,\" said Ukrainian negotiator David Arakhamia, speaking to reporters after the talks.</p><p>Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky confirmed the receipt of written proposals from the Ukrainian side, saying they would be communicated to Moscow.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky has also said he is willing to meet Mr. Putin face-to-face in any format.</p><p>Is Putin planning to use nuclear weapons?</p><p>Mr. Putin, just after the invasion, raised the alert level of Russia's nuclear forces, though not to the highest level. It appears to be the first time that Mr. Putin has publicly announced a state of combat readiness for Russia's nuclear weapons.</p><p>Russia has more than 1,500 warheads deployed and almost 3,000 in reserve, according to an assessment published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.</p><p>Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said Mr. Putin's announcement meant that Russia's nuclear forces were now ready to launch, shortening reaction times, but it could also be a display of brinkmanship.</p><p>—This explanatory article may be periodically updated.</p><p>Write to James Hookway at James.Hookway@wsj.com and Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com</p><p>Why Russia Is Invading Ukraine and What Putin Wants</p>",
