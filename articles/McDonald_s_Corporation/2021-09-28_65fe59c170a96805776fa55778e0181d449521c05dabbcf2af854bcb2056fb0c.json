  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  U.S. Resisted the Metric System -- or Did It?",
  "text": "<p>   Walter Block argues that \"Canadians Hate the Metric System\" imposed on them in 1975 (op-ed, Sept. 16). In the same year, reacting to the Metric Conversion Act, Americans resisted metrics. For example, columnist Bob Greene, syndicated then in more than 100 newspapers, started the successful WAM movement -- We Ain't Metric -- in 1978. Literary icon Tom Wolfe reminded readers that NASA had gone to the moon on inches. He helped organize the New York City \"Foot Ball\"; all the invited guests were handed \"Don't Give an Inch\" lapel pins. Writers fueled a public outcry against metrics and helped convince the Federal Highway Administration to abandon the plan to require highway signs to use metric measurements by 1984. </p><p>    Jim Schultz </p><p>   St. Johns, Mich. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    I'm 5 feet 11 inches tall, weigh 200 pounds and I set the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. But my body temperature is 36 degrees Celsius, I drive 100 kilometers an hour on the highway and C$1.25 for a liter of gas is a good deal here in Canada. My favorite deli order is 200 grams of Black Forest ham, but at McDonald's it's a Quarter Pounder. The weirdest one to me -- and I may be alone on this -- is that I measure temperature outside in Celsius but inside in Fahrenheit: \"It's going down to 10 degrees tonight. Better turn the heat up to 73.\" </p><p>   If Canada is metric-ish, the U.S. is imperial-ish. Drugs are bought in grams and kilos, and the most common bullet is the 9 millimeter. In Canada, it's the 30-ought-6 rifle shell, which is 0.3 of an inch in diameter. Whatever the measure, the size is the same. </p><p>   Whether in metric or imperial, let's agree that Prof. Block's connection between measurements, government control and a 45-year slow play by Canada to get the U.S. to convert to the metric system can only be measured as a stretch. </p><p>    Matt Roncadin </p><p>   Stouffville, Ontario </p><p></p>",
