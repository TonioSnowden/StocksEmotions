  "text": "<p>Activist investor Carl Icahn has lost his campaign against McDonald's over the fast-food chain's treatment of pigs after failing to win backing for two board nominees who would have pushed for better welfare standards.</p> <p>The Wall Street financier known for agitating for management changes after acquiring stakes in companies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4a6bca4-d60e-425a-919e-61015eb3300d\">took up pork processing as a cause</a> this year and asked McDonald's to ensure that all its US suppliers ended the practice of confining pregnant pigs in small crates. </p> <p>However, only about 1 per cent of the company's shareholders voted for Icahn's two board nominees, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/cd3da4b6-b8af-4c29-9453-492b79dce3ca\">McDonald's</a> said in a statement at its annual shareholder meeting on Thursday. All of its director nominees were re-elected. </p> <p>The vote ends a high-profile fight between the fast-food chain and Icahn, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/242a3df5-072b-4d5d-be4c-cd968daca835\">departed from his usual playbook</a> of taking a stake in a company to squeeze better returns out of management to focus on animal welfare. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/4f959587-b63d-4149-8fb8-d0487b9016f2\">Icahn</a> had claimed McDonald's allows sows to be housed in small “gestation crates” for up to six weeks. About 10 years ago, his daughter, Michelle, worked for the Humane Society, an animal welfare charity, and prompted her father to become involved in this issue. </p> <p>McDonald's has said it is on schedule to eliminate gestation crates in the US by the end of 2024.</p> <p>Icahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The billionaire failed in large part because he did not back his campaign with any financial heft. With just 200 McDonald's shares, he needed to win round other investors to get his nominees on to the board. </p> <p>The Humane Society partnered with Icahn and said other pork producers had publicly stated they could provide pork without using gestation crates. McDonald's could move faster to end the practice if it wanted to, the Humane Society said.</p> <p>“The McDonald's campaign has been a huge success,” Josh Balk, vice-president of farm animal protection at the society, said in a statement. </p> <p>“The focus put on gestation crates has led other major brands to make tremendous progress while also forcing McDonald's to finally admit that a decade after pledging to end the abuse, it's still choosing to buy pork from pregnant pigs locked in solitary confinement cages.”</p> <p>McDonald's said it was committed to animal welfare. The fast-food chain had argued that the Humane Society's definition of “crate free” represented an extremely small share of the overall pork supply and that following its guidelines would drive up costs for the company and customers. </p> <p>“What Mr Icahn is demanding from McDonald's and other companies is completely unfeasible,” it said in April.</p><p>Source: Patrick Temple-West in New York 2022 'Carl Icahn loses proxy fight with McDonald's over pig welfare ' FT.com 26 May.
