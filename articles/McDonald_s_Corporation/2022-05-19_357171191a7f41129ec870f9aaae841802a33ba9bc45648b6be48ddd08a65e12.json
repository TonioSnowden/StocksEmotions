  "title": "McDonald's to Sell Russian Business to Licensee; Fast-food giant says licensee Alexander Govor to operate restaurants under new brand",
  "text": "<p>PHOTOS: Capitalist Diplomacy: Big U.S. Brands in Russia</p><p>Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. McDonald's said in March that it has 847 restaurants in Russia and employs 62,000 people there.</p><p>The sale and purchase agreement provides for employees to be retained for at least two years on equivalent terms, McDonald's said. Mr. Govor also has agreed to fund the salaries of corporate employees who work in 45 regions of the country until closing, as well as fund existing liabilities to suppliers, landlords and utilities, the company said.</p><p>McDonald's said it expects the deal to close in coming weeks. The company owns and operates 84% of its restaurants in Russia, with the rest run by franchisees.</p><p>Shares of McDonald's fell 0.6% in Thursday morning trading to $229.61; the stock is down 14% in 2022.</p><p>Earlier this week, McDonald's said it would exit the Russian market after more than 30 years of operations in the country. McDonald's said the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, and the precipitating unpredictable operating environment, led it to conclude that continued ownership of its business in Russia was no longer tenable.</p><p>In March, McDonald's had closed restaurants in Russia and paused operations in the market.</p><p>The departure of McDonald's from Russia is particularly notable given that its arrival was emblematic of a rush among Western companies in the 1990s to enter the country, seeking to profit from its move from communism to capitalism. McDonald's opened its first Russian location in Moscow's Pushkin Square in 1990, when thousands of locals lined up to get their first taste of the American chain's burgers and fries.</p><p>In connection with the exit, McDonald's has said it expects to record an accounting charge of between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, and recognize a significant foreign-currency translation loss.</p><p>Russia and Ukraine made up around 9% of McDonald's revenue last year, given the high percentage of company-owned restaurants in those markets. The countries accounted for 2% of restaurant sales at all McDonald's locations—including those owned by franchisees—and less than 3% of operating income, the company has said. Analysts said that company-owned stores tend to be less profitable for McDonald's, compared with franchised locations.</p><p>In the long run, the move could make financial sense for McDonald's, Wall Street analysts said. McDonald's had said that since closing its Russia restaurants in March, its operations there were continuing to cost the company about $55 million a month in employee paychecks, lease payments and supply-chain costs.</p><p>McDonald's owns around 100 restaurants in Ukraine that remain closed.</p><p>McDonald's has faced the risk of Russian officials seizing its intellectual property. Russian prosecutors issued warnings to McDonald's and other Western companies in Russia, The Wall Street Journal reported in March, threatening to arrest corporate leaders there who criticize the government or to seize assets, including trademarks, of companies that pull out of the country.</p><p>Western companies across sectors have been under pressure to divest their operations in Russia since the country invaded Ukraine in late February. French auto maker Renault SA this week agreed to cede its 68% stake in Russia's biggest car maker, AvtoVAZ, to a state-backed entity.</p><p>McDonald's to Sell Russian Business to Licensee</p>",
