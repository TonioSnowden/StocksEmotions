  "text": "<p>\"I remain very troubled by the glaring oversight of needless distress caused by your company's policies,\" Mr. Icahn wrote in the letter.</p><p>Kroger, the biggest U.S. supermarket operator in terms of sales, said that it isn't directly involved in the raising or processing of any animals but that it regularly engages with advocacy groups and its suppliers to understand animal-welfare topics.</p><p>The company said its executive compensation is aligned with shareholders' interests and mostly based on performance.</p><p>Kroger said it has raised the average employee wage by 25% to $17 an hour over the past four years.</p><p>In its May 2021 proxy statement, Kroger reported that Mr. McMullen had an annual compensation of more than $22 million, while the median employee earned $24,617 in 2020.</p><p>The letter broadens Mr. Icahn's efforts to eliminate the use of gestation stalls, small crates that prevent breeding pigs, or sows, from turning around or interacting with other hogs on farms.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Icahn launched a proxy fight for two board seats at McDonald's Corp., pushing it to require its own suppliers to change their treatment of sows.</p><p>The use of gestation stalls is at the center of a debate over how pigs in the $43 billion U.S. pork industry are housed.</p><p>The state of California, animal-welfare groups like the Humane Society of the United States and Mr. Icahn have all been involved in pressing pork producers, restaurants and retailers to eliminate the stalls' use, saying they cause hogs unnecessary suffering.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
