  "text": "<p>Here is a look at key metrics measuring the devastation:</p><p>Civilian Casualties</p><p>The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said Wednesday that since Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 4,149 civilians had been confirmed killed and 4,945 injured.</p><p>Last month, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said 4,600 civilian deaths had been confirmed as a result of Russian attacks, including 232 children.</p><p>The figures don't include information from Russian-occupied territories, Ms. Venediktova said. </p><p>A funeral in Kyiv. Thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have been killed or injured.

No casualty figures have been released since. Western governments estimate that as many as 15,000 Russians have diedâ€”more than the total lost over the course of the Soviet Union's war in Afghanistan.</p><p>Last month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said up to 100 Ukrainian soldiers might be dying each day on the front lines in the east of the country. The Ukrainian leader said that as of April 16, between 2,500 and 3,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed, with up to 10,000 injured.</p><p>Refugees</p><p>More than 14 million Ukrainians have fled their homes since the start of the war with Russia, according to the U.N. Of those, nearly seven million were recorded to have departed the country as of May 29, the agency reported, among them Ukrainian nationals with dual citizenship. The remaining seven million are displaced inside Ukraine.</p><p>Economic Impact</p><p>The U.N. has estimated that Russia's invasion and the flight of refugees could cause Ukraine's economic output to fall 50% this year, while the cost of rebuilding the country could amount to as much as 500 billion euros, equivalent to $537 billion.</p><p>The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has said Ukraine's economy will likely shrink 30% this year.</p><p>Citing the impact of the conflict on energy and food prices, last month the U.N. lowered its forecast for global economic growth in 2022 to 3.1% from 4%, and its forecast for U.S. economic growth to 2.6% from 3.5%.</p><p>Poverty and Destruction</p><p>The U.N. Development Program estimates that 90% or more of Ukrainians are at risk of being pushed close to or below the poverty line and should the war continue, Ukrainian development could be set back by as much as 16 to 18 years.</p><p>\"That's how far it would be thrown back,\" Achim Steiner, the UNDP's administrator and chairman of the U.N. Sustainable Development Group, said in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month.</p><p>Mr. Zelensky said May 3 that his country had sustained $600 billion in infrastructure damage.</p><p>U.S. Aid</p><p>Last month, Congress passed a bill providing $40 billion in support to Ukraine, bringing America's commitment to almost $54 billion.</p><p>The aid includes about $6 billion to train and supply the Ukrainian military, and about $9 billion to replenish stocks of U.S. weapons sent to Ukraine. The bill also provides humanitarian aid for Ukrainian refugees, about $8.8 billion in economic assistance for the Ukrainian government, and more than $5 billion to alleviate food scarcity and high prices caused by the war.</p><p>Weaponry</p><p>The U.S. has so far sent billions of dollars in security assistance to Ukraine since the Feb. 24 invasion. The weapons sent by the U.S. have grown increasingly advanced and lethal, culminating in the Biden administration's decision this week to send guided multiple-launch rocket systems.</p><p>The U.S. has also sent 20 Mi-17 helicopters, 6,500 Javelin antitank and 1,400 Stinger antiaircraft missiles, surveillance systems, counter-artillery radar, 108 155mm howitzers and more than 220,000 rounds, 200 M113 armored personnel carriers, more than 700 Switchblade armed drones, 7,000 small arms, 50 million rounds of small-arms ammunition, body armor, helmets and much more, according to the Pentagon.</p><p>Other North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies have also contributed weaponry, including tanks, attack helicopters, rocket-propelled grenades, armed drones, antitank weapons and more.</p><p>Oil</p><p>When Russia launched its invasion, West Texas Intermediate, the main U.S. crude benchmark, was trading at about $93 a barrel. On Friday, WTI was at about $116, contributing to inflationary pressures across the world.</p><p>Sanctions</p><p>The European Union has approved six packages of sanctions on Russia, including most recently a phased embargo on Russian oil.</p><p>The U.S. and its allies have also sanctioned oligarchs, members of the Russian government and Russian President Vladimir Putin's inner circle, and some of the country's major companies. They have cut much of the Russian banking system off from international markets, prompting Russia to take measures to prop up the ruble.</p><p>As of May 26, 16 countries and the EU had imposed sanctions on Russia.</p><p>Even historically neutral Switzerland, a hub for international business and a destination for private wealth, has joined the European effort, freezing assets held in the country by Mr. Putin and other senior Russian leaders.</p><p>U.S. Corporate Withdrawals</p><p>According to a tracker maintained by the Yale School of Management, 330 U.S. companies, from Exxon Mobil Corp. to McDonald's Corp., have withdrawn from Russia, suspended or scaled back their operations in the country.</p><p>Write to Ann M.
