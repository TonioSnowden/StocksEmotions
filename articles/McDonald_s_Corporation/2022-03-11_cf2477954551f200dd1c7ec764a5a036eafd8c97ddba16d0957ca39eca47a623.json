  "title": "Ex-NASA Astronaut Scott Kelly Calls Out Russia Space Chief in Spat; Russia's space program has raised doubts about continuing its work at the International Space Station",
  "text": "<p>Reflecting on a heated exchange on Twitter earlier this week between him and Roscosmos Director General Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia's space program, Mr. Kelly said he felt the urge to share his views to his Twitter followers, particularly those in Russia, as tensions have escalated following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>\"It kind of enraged me that the country that we had been in this international partnership for 20 years would take the time to make a video to threaten to leave behind one of the crew members they are responsible for,\" Mr. Kelly said in an interview Thursday. \"They agreed to be responsible for his safety, getting him to the space station and getting him home. For me, that kind of just crossed the line.\"</p><p>Mr. Kelly has logged more than 520 days in space on four space flights and holds the record for time in orbit by a U.S. astronaut, according to NASA. He has commanded the International Space Station on three expeditions.</p><p>The video that circulated online this week shows Russian cosmonauts waving goodbye to Mark Vande Hei, a NASA astronaut stationed on the space station, and leaving him behind. A Russian state news agency recently shared the video clip on the social-media platform Telegram with a caption in Russian translated as: \"The Roscosmos television studio jokingly demonstrated the possibility of Russia withdrawing from the ISS projectâ€”the undocking of the Russian segment of the station, without which the American part of the project cannot exist.\"</p><p>The Russian state news agency said Roscosmos made the video. That claim couldn't be confirmed.</p><p>Roscosmos recently raised doubts about its future involvement in the International Space Station. Roscosmos plays a vital role supporting the orbiting lab, where astronauts and cosmonauts carry out research. Russia also announced it was halting deliveries of rocket engines to the U.S.</p><p>Seven people are now on board the International Space Station: Roscosmos cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov; European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer; and NASA astronauts Raja Chari, Thomas Marshburn, Kayla Barron and Mr. Vande Hei.</p><p>NASA didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>NASA has previously said that the partners behind the International Space Station continue to work together, with lines of communication open and training activities in place as they were before Russia's attack on Ukraine. Roscosmos has said that it continues to fulfill its operational obligations for the space station.</p><p>\"I believe in this program, I think it's important, I think we can hold it together,\" Mr. Kelly said. \"It is one place where Russia and the United States and other countries can work together peacefully. I think it has value in trying to save that.\"</p><p>Strains from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and the sanctions that have swiftly followed from Western nations and their allies, have largely cut off Russia from the rest of the world.</p><p>Mr. Rogozin tweeted a different video last week showing workers covering depictions of flags of the U.S., Japan and other nations on a Russian rocket. Mr. Kelly said he felt compelled to engage with Mr. Rogozin because of both videos.</p><p>\"Dimon, without those flags and the foreign exchange they bring in, your space program won't be worth a damn. Maybe you can find a job at McDonald's if McDonald's still exists in Russia,\" Mr. Kelly tweeted at Mr. Rogozin in Russian. Dimon is a diminutive for Dmitry.</p><p>Mr. Rogozin responded in a now deleted tweet: \"Get off, you moron! Otherwise the death of the ISS will be on your conscience!\"</p><p>They continued exchanging barbs, resulting in Mr. Rogozin blocking Mr. Kelly on Twitter.</p><p>Mr. Kelly said he would be returning a medal awarded to him in 2011 by then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev.</p><p>\"Mr. Medvedev, I am returning to you the Russian medal 'For Merit in Space Exploration,' which you presented to me,\" Mr. Kelly tweeted in Russian. \"Please give it to a Russian mother whose son died in this unjust war. I will mail the medal to the Russian embassy in Washington. Good luck.\"</p><p>Mr. Kelly said Thursday he had mailed the medal to the Russian Embassy on Wednesday.</p><p>Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com</p><p>Ex-NASA Astronaut Scott Kelly Calls Out Russia Space Chief in Spat</p>",
