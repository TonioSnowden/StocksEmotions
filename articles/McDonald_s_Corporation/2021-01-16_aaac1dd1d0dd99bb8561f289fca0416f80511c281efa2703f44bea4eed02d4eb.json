  "title": "OFF DUTY  ---  Eating & Drinking -- Market Strategy:  Waste Not, Cook Not  ---  Startups around the country are looking to lighten the burden on landfills by  offering takeout in reusable containers. Will consumers get on board?  ----  By Jane Black",
  "text": "<p>\n  Like most New Yorkers, Adam Farbiarz relies on restaurant takeout. But he doesn't like all the packaging that comes with it. </p><p>\n  Most of us simply sigh over the waste and move on. But in late 2019, Mr. Farbiarz and two partners launched DeliverZero, an online platform that lets customers order from restaurants that offer reusable containers, then return them to the delivery person the next time they order. The network began with five restaurants, all in Mr. Farbiarz's Brooklyn neighborhood. A year later, the company had 120 restaurants throughout New York City and a backlog waiting to join. </p><p>\n  DeliverZero is one of a number of startups that have set out to tackle restaurant waste. The boomlet is happening mostly in eco-conscious cities including San Francisco, Portland, Ore., and Durham, N.C. But Loop, a refillable packaging initiative from the recycling company TerraCycle, is launching pilots this year with chains such as McDonald's in the U.K., Tim Hortons in Canada and Burger King in the U.S. </p><p>\n  The efforts reflect a growing awareness among consumers about the problem of waste, in particular, plastics. According to the Overbrook Foundation, which supports organizations devoted to environmental conservation, 561 billion disposable items are used each year in the U.S. Meanwhile, the EPA reports that only 8.5% of plastic is recycled. And that was before the pandemic. </p><p>\n  Stay-at-home orders -- along with federal guidance to restaurants to use disposable plates and packaging -- have only intensified the problem. Waste numbers for 2020 are not yet available, but the market for U.S. food delivery in 2020 is expected to add up to $44 billion, a nearly 42% jump over 2019. It's a safe bet that millions of extra takeout containers have hit the trash. \"The problem is so in your face,\" Mr. Farbiarz said. \"Every time you order, you get all this garbage.\" </p><p>\n  The idea of reusable packaging for restaurants is not new. In Mumbai, dabbawalas -- the word translates to \"one who carries a box\" -- have delivered hot lunches and picked up the containers since the late 19th century. U.S. startups want to mimic that \"circular system\" but adapt and scale it for the internet age. And that's the trick: It's one thing to distribute and collect containers in a circumscribed area like a train station in Mumbai. It's quite another to do it across a whole city with thousands of restaurants. </p><p>\n  GO Box in Portland, Ore., was founded about 10 years ago to solve a local problem: overflowing trash bins around the city's food-cart lots. Since then, it has expanded to 100 restaurants, food carts and retailers. Customers pay an annual subscription to \"check out\" one or more reusable plastic containers, then return them at central drop-off points to be cleaned and used again. </p><p>\n  The system made sense because most of GO Box's vendors and customers were in downtown Portland. For many, returning a container was as easy as dropping a box outside their office door. February 2020, the month before coronavirus shutdowns took effect, was GO Box's most successful ever. \"It was working. We were expanding our footprint,\" said Jocelyn Gaudi Quarrell, GO Box's CEO. \"The convenience is the thing: If you can make doing the right thing as easy as doing the wrong thing, most people will do the right thing.\" </p><p>\n  Toronto startup Suppli integrates with established online platforms. Customers order via a restaurant's website or Uber Eats and pay a 99-cent fee for Suppli's stainless-steel containers. After use, they request a pickup or return containers to a drop site to be cleaned and returned to restaurants. CEO Megan Takeda-Tully, who previously worked helping entrepreneurs start socially responsible businesses, believes the opt-in fee makes sense. \"I've seen a willingness to pay,\" she said. \"99 cents is digestible.\" Suppli works with five restaurants currently, and Ms. Takeda-Tully plans to expand across the city within three years. </p><p>\n  DeliverZero has its own website, which looks a lot like that of an Uber Eats or DoorDash. (Also similar to the national delivery services, the company makes money by taking a cut of each order.) Unlike its reusable competitors, DeliverZero does not collect, clean and redistribute containers. Instead, customers return them dirty to the restaurants, where they are cleaned and put back into circulation. The system makes sense, said Mr. Farbiarz, since restaurants already have dishwashers. The model is getting attention. DeliverZero already has licensed its technology to a startup in Amsterdam. </p><p>\n  Such startups cannot end plastic waste alone. Last month, a group of 550 environmental organizations laid out proposals that could be adopted by the new administration, including a moratorium on new plastic production facilities. According to David Pinsky, senior plastics campaigner for Greenpeace USA, delivery giants such as DoorDash and independent restaurants must also do their part by only providing utensils, condiments and straws upon request. Still, Mr. Pinsky lauded the startups for their work: \"In the absence of leadership from larger companies, it is going to take startups to pressure them to adopt these reuse solutions. And to normalize reuse and bring it into our culture.\" </p><p>\n  For Karin Elgai, DeliverZero is making reuse easy. The 36-year-old New York fashion stylist and set designer was trying to reduce waste even before the coronavirus hit by buying shampoo and conditioner in refillable containers and toothpaste packaged in paper. But restaurant-takeout waste was tougher, especially in the midst of a global pandemic. With DeliverZero, Ms. Elgai and her family order out four or five times a week and hand back used containers to the next delivery person. As she put it, \"Now we can get takeout because it doesn't come with the guilt of filling our recycling bin with containers.\" </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  The Need to Reuse by the Numbers </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Total plastic waste in the U.S.: 36 million tons </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Amount that goes to landfill: 27 million tons </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Percentage of plastic waste that is recycled: 8.5% </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  (Source: EPA, 2018) </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  And the market for online restaurant delivery in the U.S. is booming: </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  2019: $31 billion </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  2020: $44 billion (projected) </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  2024: $77 billion (projected) </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  (Source: Morgan Stanley Research) </p><p></p>",
