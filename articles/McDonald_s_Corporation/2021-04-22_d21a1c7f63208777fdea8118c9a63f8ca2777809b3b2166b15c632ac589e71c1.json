  "text": "<p>Celebrity stylists are relieved after a year that roiled their careers and put the future of red-carpet fashion in doubt. \"So excited to finally have an event in person!\" wrote stylist Elizabeth Stewart, whose clients include best actress nominee Viola Davis and best supporting actress nominee Amanda Seyfried, in an email.</p><p>Details of the socially distanced ceremony in Los Angeles are being worked out, but it appears as if nominees and presenters -- and the sole guest that each one is permitted -- will stroll an outdoor red carpet that is shorter than usual. There won't be bleachers where fans can gather and cheer this year. And the ranks of photographers and media for \"Who are you wearing?\" interviews will be considerably cut back.</p><p>To many stylists, the Oscars ceremony is a symbolic turning of a corner in the pandemic. \"It's a glimpse of returning to normalcy to people,\" said New York-based stylist Chloe Hartstein, who will be in Los Angeles to dress best supporting actress nominee Glenn Close for the event. \"It's a little glimpse of our old lives.\"</p><p>Stylists have been tweaking some of their ideas for clients' Oscars regalia to suit an in-person event that lasts for hours -- as opposed to cameos from the waist up in a virtual ceremony. \"Honestly, the main difference is practical concerns, like are the shoes comfortable enough to wear all night,\" Ms. Stewart said.</p><p>For Micah McDonald, half of the stylist duo Wayman + Micah, who will be dressing a presenter, Oscar-winning actress Regina King, \"it's just working to ensure that Regina is comfortable, that the fabric, the fit, allows for her to sit easily and properly\" -- and in comfortable shoes.</p><p>Stylists said stars will wear bolder or exuberant styles, partly out of a pent-up desire for glamour, continuing a trend that emerged at the mostly-virtual Golden Globes in February. For much of the past year, stylists have sought a balance between being sensitive to the challenging times and offering escapism. Now, some are feeling more creative.</p><p>Wayman Bannerman, Mr. McDonald's business partner, said Ms. King's conceptual look will be \"something that's new to what we've brought to the physical red carpet. A fresh moment for us.\" Her ensemble will send \"a message of strength, opulence and joy, really homing in on the things that people have not felt as much of in this past year with everything that has taken place,\" Mr. McDonald said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ms. Hartstein said Ms. Close's Oscars look \"is definitely a celebration\" while being \"very true to her and the icon that she is in the industry.\"</p><p>The Oscars red carpet is considered the high point of the awards-season circuit. A memorable appearance there can propel a young star's Hollywood career or cast more familiar names in new lights for potential roles or lucrative fashion and cosmetic brand advertising contracts. The red carpet also represents a big marketing opportunity for fashion and jewelry brands.</p><p>The ceremony will cap an unusual season of dressing stars for awards ceremonies. \"To have such a huge season with Riz and LaKeith and yet not to be near them, it's been a trip,\" said stylist Julie Ragolia, who will dress best actor nominee Riz Ahmed and best supporting actor nominee LaKeith Stanfield for the Oscars. During this awards season, she has been styling them by video mostly from New York, where she is based. She plans to be in Los Angeles for the Oscars. \"All of them having been virtual thus far and then to have the final one be live is quite special,\" Ms. Ragolia said.</p><p>Safety concerns persist about the ceremony, which was postponed from February due to Covid-19 concerns. The producers' initial intent to gather all nominees in person and dispense with Zoom acceptance speeches sparked an outcry amid travel restrictions and rising Covid cases in parts of the world. The Academy then added hubs in Paris and London for nominees such as best supporting actress contender Olivia Colman, who will be in London. \"I was like 'Yay, we can go ahead,' because it's the biggest awards of the year,\" said Miranda Almond, Ms. Colman's stylist. \"It would just have been a great shame had we not been able to do it.\" There will be photo opportunities at the hubs but not the fanfare of L.A. \"We're not going to go with something that's full length because we don't have that sort of red carpet to walk down,\" said Ms. Almond, who is senior fashion editor at Harper's Bazaar UK. \"It will still be glamorous and evening wear.\"</p><p>Though stylists are excited about the return of an in-person red carpet, some admitted they will miss the alternative photo shoots they concocted for virtual awards shows. Social-media followers got to see stars posing in outfits in pools, backyards, homes and hotel suites. \"We get these amazing photos that are better quality and better capture the story of the look and the glamour of the look\" than a wire-service red-carpet shot, said stylist Christina Pacelli, whose clients include Laverne Cox, a star of \"Promising Young Woman,\" which is up for best picture. At times on a frenzied red carpet, Ms. Pacelli said, \"there's only one or two photos that are good when there can be so much more.\"</p><p>(See related article: \"A Skeptic's Guide to Hollywood's Big Night\" -- WSJ Apr. 22, 2021)</p>",
