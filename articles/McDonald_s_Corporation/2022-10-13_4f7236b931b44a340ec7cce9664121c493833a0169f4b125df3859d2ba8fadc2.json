  "title": "With Adult Happy Meals, McDonald's Sparks a Collecting Frenzy; Perhaps not since the era of Teenie Beanie Babies has the fast-food chain aimed so directly at the collector market",
  "text": "<p>\"I was in it for the toys entirely,\" said Mr. Palmeri, 38, a branding specialist in Arlington, Va., who said he spent $46 on the quartet of meals. The price caught him off guard: Burgers have certainly gotten pricier since his childhood.</p><p>To keep his waistline in check, Mr. Palmeri tries to stay away from fast food, so after scarfing down a few McNuggets, he gave most of the meal away to his co-workers. The toys, however? They not only came home with him, but he boasted about them on Instagram.</p><p>These nugget-sized trinkets are the main draw of the fast-food chain's current collaboration with Cactus Plant Flea Market, a minuscule American apparel brand run by Cynthia Lu, an assistant and stylist to Pharrell Williams. Ms. Lu did not respond to an interview request for this article. McDonald's declined to disclose the financial terms of the partnership.</p><p>MORE IN ON TREND</p><p>* Levi's Jeans From the 1880s, Sold for $76,000, Reveal a Complicated History</p><p>* The $100 Sunglasses Minting Millions From 1980s Nostalgia</p><p>* The Beer Koozie-Like Shoe Selling Out Across America</p><p>Accompanying an order of a Big Mac or 10-piece McNugget meal, these slightly warped figurines depict Grimace, the Hamburglar, Birdie and a uniform-wearing \"Cactus Buddy,\" each with two sets of eyes and squiggly smiles—common motifs of Ms. Lu's brand.</p><p>These meals can be pricier than a normal combo meal, though the company said prices depend on the location of the restaurant. At my local McDonald's in Brooklyn, a large 10-piece McNugget Cactus Plant Flea Market meal (with toy) is $17.99, while a standard 10-piece large McNugget meal is $14.09.</p><p>The limited figures have sparked a frenzy. Some franchises are entirely sold out of the meals, and buyers are flipping their toys for more than $20 a pop on resale sites like StockX. While the franchise wouldn't disclose sales figures, it said that the meals were selling faster than anticipated.</p><p>For many adult eaters, the toys sparked cozy childhood memories. \"These characters are what I grew up with,\" said Mr. Palmeri, who is also a longtime fan of Ms. Lu's energetic streetwear label.</p><p>The Cactus Plant Flea Market partnership follows other McDonald's menu tie-ups with celebrities including Travis Scott, BTS, Saweetie and J Balvin, as well as the TV show \"Rick and Morty.\" While these partnerships have often included merchandise such as T-shirts, they have not included Happy Meal-esque figurines until now.</p><p>The CPFM (as it is commonly abbreviated) meal goes further, with a redesigned box, toys, a nationwide ad campaign and an extensive apparel line sold online at a dedicated website, featuring $150 hoodies and $130 sweatpants carrying the brand's signature oversize fonts, puffy prints and zany slogans like \"I came, I saw, I dipped! (McNuggets)\".</p><p>For the venture, McDonald's said it relinquished creative control to Ms. Lu and her team. \"You've got to get comfortable with turning over the pen,\" said Tariq Hassan, the fast-food giant's chief marketing and customer-experience officer. But it's who McDonald's turned the pen over to that's surprising. CPFM is far from a mainstream entity like Travis Scott or BTS. It's not carried at Nordstrom, let alone Walmart or Amazon.</p><p>It drops its boxy hoodies and tie-dye fleeces online in tiny quantities, which fans snatch up and occasionally flip for profit. Celebrities like Kid Cudi, Lil Uzi Vert and Timothée Chalamet have all worn the brand's hippie-luxe clothes. CPFM has also collaborated with Nike and Marc Jacobs.</p><p>The niche nature of CPFM is a plus: The streetwear upstart is plainly not a brand that your dad would know. In explaining why McDonald's partnered with this culty brand and not, say, a behemoth like Crocs (as did its fast-food rival Kentucky Fried Chicken), Mr. Hassan said \"it was less about looking for scale: big, small,\" than for cultural relevance. By cozying up to a streetwear brand favored by rappers and the Gen-Z shoppers who want to dress like them, McDonald's is trying to seem like it has a finger on the pulse.</p><p>Social media has been a key driver for adult Happy Meal mania. TikTok videos of people showing off their four-eyed Big Mac companions have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Online word-of-mouth has driven collectors to the golden arches.</p><p>\"People were talking about it all over Twitter,\" said Larz Broussard, 25, a content creator and shift supervisor at Starbucks in Los Angeles. \"I think everyone wants to be involved.\" He purchased two figurines which now sit on his TV stand at home. He even kept the box, perching it on his nightstand.</p><p>In this contemporary age where adults hoard skateboards and cartoony sneakers, even a plastic Happy Meal toy can be seen as a coveted objet d'art. Said Mr. Broussard, \"Now that we're older, our way of 'playing' with [toys] is just by collecting them.\"</p><p>Salvatore Rosenblatt, 25, who runs a marketing company in Jupiter, Fla., and purchased one of the plastic toys, said they have more of \"an art toy style, like more of a KAWS style,\" likening these cheap plastic doodads to the pricey figurines made by the blue-chip New York artist, which can sell for five figures.</p><p>The adult Happy Meal hype has stretched some McDonald's employees thin. On Reddit and across social media, commenters identifying as workers have shared stories about hordes of customers ordering multiple meals during the dinner rush to amass all four of the toys. When asked about these employee's experiences, Mr. Hassan said it was \"something we keep our ears to the wall on and ensure that we're there to support our crew.\"</p><p>Employees may be happy to know that the collaboration ends when toy supplies are exhausted. (McDonald's did not share how many toys were produced.) As for future adult Happy Meals, the company said it would assess the success of this project and see. In the short term, it's clearly heavily courting nostalgia to draw diners (and shoppers) back in. Earlier this month, the chain announced that it was reintroducing the Jack-o'-lantern-faced \"Halloween Pails\" from the 1980s.</p><p>Write to Jacob Gallagher at jacob.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Which McDonald's toys have you collected?
