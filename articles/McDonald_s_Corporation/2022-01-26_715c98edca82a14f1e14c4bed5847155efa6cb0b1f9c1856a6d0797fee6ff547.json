Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The tweets come after cryptocurrency prices -- including dogecoin -- have fallen sharply in recent days.</p><p>Dogecoin, initially started as a joke in 2013, is in the top 10 by market value for cryptocurrencies, according to CoinMarketCap. Its value tends to fluctuate based on what Mr. Musk says about the volatile cryptocurrency.</p><p>When pressed to explain what dogecoin was during a \"Saturday Night Live\" performance in May 2021, Mr. Musk, who was hosting the show, eventually said, \"Yeah, it's a hustle,\" which sent the cryptocurrency's price falling.</p><p>The price of dogecoin has lost roughly 80% of its value since Mr. Musk's SNL appearance.</p><p>In addition to accepting dogecoin for payment for some merchandise, Tesla last year bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin.
