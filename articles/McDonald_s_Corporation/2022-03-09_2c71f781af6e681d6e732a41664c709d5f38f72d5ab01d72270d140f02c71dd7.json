Thirty-two years on, the symbolism was no less powerful as McDonald's announced that restaurant would be closing, along with the rest of its 850 outlets in Russia, as companies continue to head for the exit en masse.</p> <p>For now, McDonald's will continue to pay the salaries of its 62,000 Russian employees. Like Starbucks, Pepsi and Coca-Cola, which all made similar announcements yesterday, it is calling this a temporary suspension rather than a permanent exit from Russia. That's in contrast with the Big Four accounting firms, which have all announced plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b26e0e8-af55-4b33-b55e-4894875c5692\">offload their Russian operations</a>. Another important statement came yesterday from oil company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3d1d58a-b810-4200-aa52-27f3fedd0e5e\">Shell</a>, which said it would no longer buy oil from Russia — and apologised for purchasing a cargo of Russian crude last week.</p> <p>Some companies, however, deny any ethical duty to exit Russia. Danone chief executive Antoine de Saint-Affrique <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a812ec18-058c-49b2-8a70-e8791ea1e43a\">told the FT</a> that the company has “a responsibility to the people we feed, the farmers who provide us with milk”; Tadashi Yanai, founder of Japanese fashion brand Uniqlo, says he's keeping his Russian stores open because “clothing is a necessity of life”. But such defiant voices are looking increasingly lonely as the corporate exodus continues.</p> <p>Today's edition stays on the fallout from Ukraine. I look at what the conflict means for the energy transition, and Tamami considers the response from Asia, while Kristen and Patrick give an update on Germany's nuclear debate. See you on Friday. <em>&#xa0;(Simon Mundy)</em></p> <h1>What does the Ukraine war mean for the energy transition?</h1> <p>Chinese billionaire Xiang Guangda presumably wasn't thinking about the threat of war in Ukraine when he laid a huge short bet on the price of nickel, on the London Metal Exchange. The trade was designed to protect his company Tsingshan Holding Group, the world's biggest nickel producer, against price volatility. But it could now face billions of dollars in trading losses. As Xiang scrambled to close his short positions, the nickel price doubled yesterday to more than $100,000 a tonne — five times its level at the start of this year.</p> <p>The extraordinary surge in the nickel price underscores the turmoil that the Ukraine conflict is sending through commodity markets — with important implications for the energy transition. Russia is a key source not only of hydrocarbons, but also of several minerals that are crucial to the clean power sector. For example, in high-grade nickel, an important ingredient in electric car batteries, Russia produces about a tenth of the world's supply. And with the doors of international trade now closing in the country's face, price surges from the ensuing supply squeeze would seem inevitable.</p> <p>Analysts at Bank of America estimate that if nickel prices were to settle at about $80,000 a tonne — a level that would have seemed absurd a few weeks ago, but much lower than the price reached yesterday — then the cost of electric vehicle batteries would rise by nearly a quarter, and the total bill-of-materials cost for electric vehicles by almost a tenth.</p> <p>Russia is also among the big producers of copper (with its myriad clean power applications) and aluminium (crucial to the production of wind turbines) — both of which hit record high prices this week. All this looks challenging for renewable energy companies, which have already been suffering squeezed margins since last year thanks to rising commodity prices.</p> <p>But many of those clean power companies saw big price gains yesterday, too — Denmark's Vestas, for example, was up by more than a tenth. The trigger for the rise was an announcement from the European Commission of a plan to eliminate the EU's dependence on Russian gas by 2030, with an accelerated deployment of clean electricity and renewable hydrogen.</p> <p>Stock market investors are judging that the long-term benefits for these companies from the EU's expanded renewables ambitions will more than outweigh the pain of the higher input costs. </p> <p>In the short term though, as the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93eb06ec-ba6c-4ad2-8fae-5b66235632b2\">FT's Big Read</a> pointed out yesterday, the pullback from Russian gas will have the less savoury effect of a spike in demand for coal (another commodity whose price has been booming amid the war). And while some gains for the energy transition could stem from this conflict, they pale beside the horror of the violence sweeping Ukraine. <em>(Simon Mundy)</em></p> <h1>‘Tesla speed' needed for German renewable energy as door slams on nuclear power</h1> <p>The earthquake in energy markets this week sparked calls for Germany to reconsider the decision to close its nuclear power plants. On Monday, Mark Carney said restarting nuclear plants in Germany “could provide a buffer” as the country scrambles to shift away from Russian natural gas.</p> <p>Recall, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db203958-8a8d-11e0-b2f1-00144feab49a\">after the Fukushima disaster</a>, Germany promised to shutter its nuclear plants by 2022. At the time, nuclear power generated one-quarter of the country's electricity. </p> <p>But on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.bmwi.de/Redaktion/DE/Pressemitteilungen/2022/03/20220308-bundeswirtschaftsministerium-und-bundesumweltministerium-legen-prufung-zur-debatte-um-laufzeiten-von-atomkraftwerken-vor.html\">Germany said</a> it would fulfil its pledge to close the remaining nuclear plants this year.</p> <p>“After weighing up the benefits and risks, an extension of the service life of the three remaining nuclear power plants is not recommended,” the government said.</p> <p>Germany's nuclear wind down was so far along that it would not be possible to switch it back on. Campaign group Transport &amp; Environment told Moral Money that Germany's infrastructure for producing and delivering nuclear power has got so small, that it would not make a dent in the country's energy problem.</p> <p>What has been lost amid the energy market turmoil is the resurgence of renewable energy stocks. Germany on Tuesday reiterated it was getting greener every year. The country had 38 per cent renewable electricity in 2018 and is on target to hit at least 40 per cent by 2025.</p> <p>After taking a beating toward the end of 2021, the share prices for Danish wind power companies Oersted and Vestas are up about 5 and 11 per cent respectively.</p> <p>Germany's development of renewable energy and other electricity options “must be done at ‘Tesla speed',” said economy minister Robert Habeck <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-ministries-say-cannot-recommend-extending-nuclear-plants-lifetime-2022-03-08/\">said on Tuesday</a>, referring to the carmaker's maniacal productivity under chief executive Elon Musk. Germany, which has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc5a3b02-a90d-4206-a441-1bada29feba2\">slow to handle past crises such as Covid-19</a>, certainly has a lot of work to do. <em>(Kristen Talman and Patrick Temple-West)</em></p> <h1>Asia's challenge in isolating Russia </h1> <p>In the past two weeks, western governments have moved with <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/05/world/europe/russia-ukraine-invasion-sanctions.html\">unprecedented speed</a> to show unity against Russia in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. If you are only reading newspapers in the west, you may have felt that Russia has been completely isolated in the field of global politics.</p> <p>From Asia, however, a different picture has emerged.</p> <p>Big players in the region — such as China and India — have declined to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine or to join international sanctions. Political and economic interdependency with Moscow have kept both nations on the sidelines. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/06/india/india-russia-arms-deal-putin-modi-intl-hnk/index.html\">India's arms deal with Russia</a>, for example, is likely to be at the forefront of thinking for New Delhi officials. </p> <p>Pakistan's prime minister <a href=\"https://www.dawn.com/news/1676820/energy-cooperation-in-focus-during-pm-imrans-meeting-with-russian-president-putin\">Imran Khan was in Moscow</a> for talks on economic co-operation and a long-delayed gas pipeline, when his host, Russian president Vladimir Putin, launched the invasion into Ukraine in late February. Since then, Khan has <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistani-premier-hits-out-western-envoys-joint-letter-russia-2022-03-06/&#xa0;\">rejected the west's call</a> to condemn Russia's action and committed to being neutral without participating “in any camp”.</p> <p>The idea of alienating Russia is even harder for Sri Lanka, where citizens have already been suffering from hours of routine power outages. </p> <p>The government officials have argued the revival of tourism and tea exports will cover <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21217f9e-9c4c-4483-968c-25433e62d9c0\">key bond repayments due this year</a>, but the war has savaged two main markets for the industries: Russia and Ukraine. </p> <p>Russia is the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a6d3822-7c7a-4c62-9a0e-dcff37e2a175\">largest market for Sri Lanka's tourism</a> and the second largest for its tea, wrote our colleagues Benjamin Parkin and Mahendra Ratnaweera. Ukraine is the second-biggest source of visitors. Outbound tourism from both countries has collapsed amid the war, while Russian purchases of tea are threatened by its banks' expulsion from the Swift payments system.</p> <p>The big three rating agencies — Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch — have downgraded Sri Lanka since late last year, and analysts have warned that the war has increased the island country's chance of default. Perhaps it's not surprising, then, that Sri Lanka was one of a small minority of countries to abstain from condemning Russia's invasion at the UN. (<em>Tamami Shimizuishi, Nikkei)</em></p> <h1>Chart of the Day </h1> <p>Over the past week, companies have struggled to determine how to respond to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose found. </p> <p>In its survey of 103 businesses, the most common response — representing a fifth of respondents — was that companies had not yet decided on corporate action. Among those that did take action, the most common move was to provide support for Ukrainian employees. (<em>Kristen Talman</em>)</p> <h1>Smart read</h1> <ul>  <li><p>When we decided that the latest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/moral-money-forum\">Moral Money Forum</a> report should cover the thorny subject of what role business should play in politics, we had no idea what geopolitics had in store for business. The snowballing business boycott of Russia over Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine has no precedent. But it is just the most recent example of a challenge facing executives around the world: when should they speak up?&#xa0;Read Sarah Murray's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ceffa36-899a-4457-919f-b70902162f64\">timely guide</a> to what constitutes best practice in this emerging field of corporate political responsibility.
