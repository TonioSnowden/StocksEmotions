Workers are opposing changes to work schedules, overtime and healthcare sought by Mondelez in contract negotiations.</p><p>Disruptions to snack production stemming from the strike would mark the latest supply challenge for food sellers since the start of the pandemic last year. Shortages of labor and raw materials in recent months have left retailers short on everything from packaged beverages such as Capri Sun to pet food.</p><p>An expanded version of this story appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Popular stories from WSJ.com:</p><p>McDonald's McFlurry Machine Is Broken (Again).
