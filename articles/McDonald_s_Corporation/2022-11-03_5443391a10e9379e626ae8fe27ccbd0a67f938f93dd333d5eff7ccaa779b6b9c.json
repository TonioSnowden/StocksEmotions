  "title": "Starbucks Rings Up Record Sales, Though Cafe Investments Erode Profit; Coffee chain reports sales milestone as it spends on employee wages, training",
  "text": "<p>The company's net income for its fiscal fourth quarter dropped by roughly 50% to $878 million, compared with the $1.76 billion the company reported for last year's period. Starbucks said store-level profit margins were pressured by employee wage increases and new training for workers, along with increased supply chain, food and material costs.</p><p>Starbucks in September outlined a wide-ranging revamp of the coffee chain, ranging from cafe upgrades to expanded employee benefits, aimed in part at resolving baristas' longstanding frustrations that have led some to form unions over the past year. Mr. Schultz suspended billions of dollars in share buybacks upon returning to lead the company in April, saying much of the money would be better spent on improving Starbucks stores and investing in its workers.</p><p>Mr. Schultz said Thursday that Starbucks's investments in its U.S. stores and employees are starting to pay off, with worker retention and speed of service improving.</p><p>\"We have come a long way in that arena,\" said Frank Britt, Starbucks's chief strategy and transformation officer, referring to the company's efforts to improve its work environment.</p><p>Starbucks shares rose 2.2% in after-market trading to $86.50. Starbucks shares were down 28% this year through Thursday's close, while the S&amp;P 500 index was down 22% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 12%.</p><p>Restaurants are continuing to report robust business in the U.S. despite challenges mounting for consumers and the economy. McDonald's Corp. last week reported strong U.S. sales, though executives said they are preparing for a broader economic downturn.</p><p>Starbucks said Thursday the broader business environment is uncertain, but consumers have maintained their appetite for its drinks. The company notched a number of record sales weeks in the U.S. during September as customers bought pumpkin spice beverages and paid extra to add syrups and other ingredients, executives said.</p><p>Mr. Schultz said higher menu prices haven't slowed sales at its cafes, and Starbucks retains pricing power. Prices are up around 6% overall, he added.</p><p>Starbucks is in the midst of a leadership transition. The company's incoming chief executive, Laxman Narasimhan, started at the company Oct. 1 and is slated to remain interim CEO until April 1, when Mr. Schultz is set to step down. Mr. Narasimhan, previously CEO of U.K.-based Lysol maker Reckitt Benckiser Group PLC, has moved to Seattle and has since spent time in stores in the U.K. and U.S. While in Texas locations last month, Mr. Narasimhan learned to make drinks and collected opinions from employees and customers, he said in a company message last week.</p><p>\"It struck me that my role in the future of CEO would be most similar to the role in customer support,\" Mr. Narasimhan said in the message.</p><p>Mr. Schultz said Thursday he is confident that Mr. Narasimhan is the right long-term leader for Starbucks, and that they speak daily as he learns more about the company.</p><p>Last week, Starbucks convened around 2,000 store leaders in Seattle for meetings, with the company emphasizing its corporate goals and how managers should work with chain baristas, Mr. Schultz said. \"[It's] our collective responsibility to raise the bar,\" Mr. Schultz wrote in a separate internal message to employees last week.</p><p>For the fiscal fourth quarter, Starbucks reported per-share earnings adjusted for one-time items of 81 cents, ahead of analysts' expectations of 72 cents.</p><p>In the key China market, same-store sales fell 16% in the period compared with a year earlier as the company said it continued to face challenges related to Covid-19 restrictions in the country. Over the three months that ended July 3, same-store sales in China fell 44% year-over-year.</p><p>Mr. Schultz said the company expects the pandemic to continue to weigh on its business in China, but Starbucks remains committed to expanding there.</p><p>Starbucks added 763 stores during the quarter, and now has 35,711 locations globally. Mr. Schultz said the company expects to add an average of eight new stores a day globally for the next three years, targeting around 45,000 locations by the end of its 2025 fiscal year.</p><p>Starbucks said it expected foreign currency fluctuations to hurt its revenue growth in its 2023 fiscal year. The company projected its store-level profit margins to improve later in the fiscal year.</p><p>Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com</p><p>Starbucks Rings Up Record Sales, Though Cafe Investments Erode Profit</p>",
