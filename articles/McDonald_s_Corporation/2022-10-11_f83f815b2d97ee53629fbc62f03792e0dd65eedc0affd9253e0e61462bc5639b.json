  "text": "<p>While Chick-fil-A's drive-through was the most-crowded, its customers were among the most satisfied compared with the other chains surveyed, according to Intouch Insight's report, published last week.</p><p>Chick-fil-A is known for training its employees to be friendly and courteous, something that may have helped Intouch Insight rank its customers as the most satisfied for the past few years.</p><p>\"With friendliness having declined in the industry, brands who can crack the code on employee satisfaction and training will be able to drive better customer service,\" said Laura Livers, Intouch Insight's head of strategic growth.</p><p>Representatives for Chick-fil-A and KFC didn't immediately return requests for comment Monday.</p><p>Drive-throughs surged in popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic as customers looked for dining options that limited their in-person contact. In recent years, some chain restaurants with drive-through lanes said they saw an increase in sales.</p><p>KFC and Hardee's had some of the shortest waits, averaging between five and 5 1/2 minutes, according to Intouch Insight. The chains had the least-crowded drive-throughs, with fewer than two cars on average in line at a given time.</p><p>Intouch Insight also collected data from Arby's, Burger King, Carl's Jr., Dunkin', McDonald's Corp., Taco Bell and Wendy's Co.</p>",
