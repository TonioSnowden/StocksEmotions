  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Business News: Dollar Drinks Fade From McDonald's",
  "text": "<p>McDonald's owners from restaurants ranging from Chicago to Tennessee have boosted the prices for drinks by several dimes or are set to shortly. Out of McDonald's 56 U.S. markets, 16 restaurant co-ops voted to advertise the company's value menu rather than dollar drinks, allowing them to move away from them, according to people familiar with the discussions.</p><p>McDonald's said customers can count on the chain for great value, and that good deals remain an important part of its marketing strategy. \"Franchisees set prices and have the flexibility to create promotions that will drive demand locally,\" the company said.</p><p>The company for years has offered soda and other cold beverages of any size for a buck as part of their U.S. value menu. The promotion withstood the 2008 financial crisis and lasted through much of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>For longtime fans of dollar drinks, the promotion's demise reflects the overall state of the economy, conjuring up a mix of sorrow and disbelief. \"I would hope this is something temporary and it would go back to how it was soon,\" said Damien Munoz, a 23-year-old retail worker in Naperville, Ill.</p><p>Mr. Munoz said he began noticing in mid-June that a small soda at a local McDonald's in Chicago was still a dollar, but a medium cost $1.39, and large $1.69. He said he started checking other area McDonald's and found their prices, too, were changing. Dollar drinks still exist at many McDonald's restaurants, including as a limited-time promotion on the chain's app in some markets that don't have them all the time now.</p>",
