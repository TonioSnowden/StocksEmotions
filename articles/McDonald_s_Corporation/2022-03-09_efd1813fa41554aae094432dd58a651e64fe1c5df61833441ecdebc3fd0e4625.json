  "text": "<p>In the international effort to stop Mr. Putin, the U.S. and its European allies have looked to inflict economic pain on the Russian leader with sanctions and mounting efforts to cut off Moscow's energy exports. The Russian leader has shown no indication he would bow to pressure to end the war. Several rounds of talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators have resulted in limited cease-fires to evacuate civilians, but they frequently collapse.</p><p>Fears are growing that the Russian leader will double down on his military effort, resulting in more civilian casualties. </p><p>A soldier rested in Ukraine as smoke billowed on the horizon.

He called it \"de-Nazification,\" falsely claiming that Kyiv is controlled by a cabal of American-sponsored neo-Nazis.</p><p>More significantly, Mr. Putin regards Ukraine and Russia as inseparable, \"one people, a single whole,\" and aims to intercept Kyiv's closer integration with the West and especially its aspiration to join NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union before its collapse at the end of the Cold War in 1991, after which Russia lost much of its economic power and prestige. At the least, he intends to compel Ukraine to recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, and two breakaway regions in Donetsk and Luhansk. He also aims to secure Ukraine's commitment to maintain strict neutrality.</p><p>Mr. Putin has already expanded Moscow's influence over former Soviet republics such as Belarus, Georgia and Moldova, but Ukraine has long been the primary prize, sitting on Russia's western flank, where, historically, it has been most vulnerable to attack.</p><p>The trend among Ukrainians to support closer integration with Europe and the growing use of the Ukrainian language instead of Russian has alarmed the Kremlin, however. And since the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has become a high-profile champion of Ukrainian sovereignty, with his displays of defiance from Kyiv and steady lobbying of NATO and the international community to help his country stop Mr. Putin. </p><p>A woman wept during the evacuation of Irpin, Ukraine.

Russian forces have faced heavy resistance from Ukrainian troops and volunteers, with a crucial early battle preventing Russian forces from seizing Hostomel Airport near Kyiv, where Russia had planned to land new fighting forces. With the pace of the advance slowing, Russia has turned to shelling residential areas in an apparent effort to cow the Ukrainian defenses. The second-largest city, Kharkiv, has been badly hit though it is still held by Ukraine. But the southern city of Kherson is now under Russian control, the first regional capital to be occupied.</p><p>Security concerns over the safety of Ukraine's nuclear plants, including the one at Chernobyl that exploded in 1986 and whose ruins and waste are capped and carefully monitored, are becoming a persistent theme in the war, highlighting the indiscriminate nature of the Russian bombardments.</p><p>In the southeastern city of Mariupol, where efforts to implement a cease-fire have stumbled, residents have gone without power, cellphone coverage or water supplies for more than a week, while locals have been evacuated from some other areas. Mr. Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has repeatedly lashed out at the West for refusing to implement a no-fly zone over his country to prevent Russian bombardments of civilian areas. Mr. Putin has warned that any action against Russian combat aircraft over Ukraine from the soil of another country would be met with an immediate military response.</p><p>Ukraine's defenders have held on to Kyiv, though the White House has warned that Ukraine's capital could fall as Russian troops try to push into it in their bid to decapitate the Ukrainian government.</p><p>What is the mood in Ukraine?</p><p>After the initial shock of the invasion, many Ukrainians were forced to decide whether to flee, if possible, or stay and fight. With strong Ukrainian resistance, Moscow pivoted to indiscriminate strikes that hit civilian targets in what has been an unsuccessful effort to bludgeon the Ukrainian government into submission. Refugee numbers are climbing: More than two million people have left the country and a further one million are internally displaced, according to the United Nations refugee agency.</p><p>In Kyiv, the primary target of the Russian offensive, the streets are now mostly empty of residents, with just soldiers and some elderly left behind. Those who have remained in cities spend many of their nights in air-raid shelters or preparing to repel the Russian advance. The flight westward to Poland resulted in long lines of cars near the border, forcing many people to abandon their cars and walk to the border for hours in bitter cold, carrying children and a few belongings in the biggest movement of people in Europe since World War II.</p><p>Ukrainians working overseas are returning home to join the fight. Mr. Zelensky has announced the formation of a new International Legion of the Ukrainian army, along the lines of the International Brigades that helped defend the Spanish republic in the 1930s civil war there. He said the invasion of Ukraine was the beginning of a war against all of Europe.</p><p>What are NATO and the West doing in response to Russia?</p><p>NATO allies are bolstering the alliance's eastern flank, which borders Ukraine, deploying jet fighters and ships to the region. The European Union has set out plans for loans and grants to Ukraine valued at more than $1.3 billion, while the U.S. ordered thousands of troops to prepare for possible deployment and moved to provide as much as $350 million in additional military aid for Ukraine. NATO isn't, however, planning to enforce a no-fly zone to limit Russian aerial threats, despite pleas from Ukraine.</p><p>The West's primary weapon is to cut Russia off from global financial markets and damage its economy. The U.S. is also banning imports of Russian oil, the lifeblood of Moscow's economy, as well as Russian natural gas and other energy sources, President Biden said on March 8 at the White House. The EU plans to cut its imports of Russian natural gasby two-thirds by the end of this year, and the U.K. said it would phase out the Russian oil imports. Germany earlier halted the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline. </p><p>Refugees lined up in Lviv, Ukraine, as they waited for a train or bus that would take them to the border as they seek to leave the country.

As the measures came into force, long lines of Russians appeared at banks in Moscow and other cities hoping to withdraw dollars. The governor of the central bank, Elvira Nabiullina, appeared on state television, dressed all in black, to declare that Russia's financial system and economy \"are facing a totally abnormal situation\" as policy makers doubled interest rates to 20%.</p><p>The Russian ruble lost more than one-fifth of its value against the dollar on the first day, and economists expect the economy to incur a sizable contraction this year along with double-digit inflation.</p><p>Middle-class Russians who had grown used to foreign vacations and access to Western consumer goods are now facing up to the prospect of spending long winters at home without any McDonald's burgers, Starbucks coffee or services such as Netflix and Spotify as Western brands pull out of the country. The development of energy resources is also under threat as companies such as BP and Shell said they would step back from doing business with Russia. </p><p>Civilians pulled luggage through the snow as they left Irpin, Ukraine.

A third round of talks between Russia and Ukraine, held in Belarus on March 7, failed to achieve much progress on how to end the war, as Kyiv refused to accept Russian demands that it recognize the 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia and the independence of the Russian-created statelets in the Donbas region. Despite the Russian offensive, Ukrainian forces continued to hold most of the population areas in Donbas that they controlled before the invasion began.</p><p>The Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers are tentatively scheduled to meet on the sidelines of an international conference in Antalya, Turkey, on Thursday.</p><p>Is Putin planning to use nuclear weapons?</p><p>Mr. Putin on Feb. 27 raised the alert level of Russia's nuclear forces, though not to the highest level. It appears to be the first time that Mr. Putin has publicly announced a state of combat readiness for Russia's nuclear weapons.</p><p>Russia has more than 1,500 warheads deployed and almost 3,000 in reserve, according to an assessment published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.</p><p>Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said Mr. Putin's announcement meant that Russia's nuclear forces were now ready to launch, shortening reaction times, but it could also be a display of brinkmanship.</p><p>Write to James Hookway at James.Hookway@wsj.com and Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com</p><p>Why Russia Is Invading Ukraine, and What Is Happening in the War</p>",
