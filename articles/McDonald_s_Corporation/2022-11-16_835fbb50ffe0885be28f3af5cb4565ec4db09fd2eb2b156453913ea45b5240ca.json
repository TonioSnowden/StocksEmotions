  "text": "<p>As we see the proportion of workers over 50 in hospitality roles increasing in the UK (“Bars and restaurants turn to over-50s to plug labour gap”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6bc27022-6f38-426b-b26c-ab0e7015f0f4\">Report</a>, October 10), I agree with the stance taken by Kathy Dyball, the director at Caterer.com whom you quote, that employers taking on older candidates is a step in the right direction. </p> <p>However, where she argues that more roles “that can suit people of any working age” need to be highlighted, I find myself in disagreement. Isn't the onus on employers to make jobs with them more accommodating to an ageing workforce?</p> <p>Despite what McDonald's adverts may suggest, many older people are not “retiring types”. However, ageist working practices lead many over-50s to either give up looking for new opportunities or retire, disillusioned, from jobs they once enjoyed.</p> <p>Employers have a significant opportunity now to not just lure older people back to the labour market, but make people want to stay in work well past the age of 50 by creating a culture that celebrates age diversity. For example, recruiters should give equal weighting to skills and experience, so older candidates who need training aren't discounted. Multi-generational collaboration within the workplace, through projects and older employees training the younger, will also help older workers to contribute and feel fulfilled by their roles.</p> <p>Rather than simply plugging labour gaps, employers can make a change that will benefit the over-50s, their employers and generations to come. When we are in a cost of living crisis that's only being made worse by a tightened labour market, why not run with this opportunity?</p> <p><strong>Steve Butler</strong> <br><em>Chief Executive, Punter Southall Aspire, London WC2, UK</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Over-50s can do more than plug the labour gap' FT.com 16 November.
