  "title": "REVIEW --- Moving Targets: Could Twitter Polls Decide More Things?",
  "text": "<p>Here are a few examples of legally binding Twitter polls that could help us reach that elevated plateau:</p><p>1. Should KISS retire? They've been around forever, two original members have been replaced, and a lot of people think that their brand of pop Kabuki heavy metal is cheesy and outdated. Of course, a lot of people thought this in 1977. Bands that have overstayed their welcome should agree to accept the results of a Twitter poll and head for the exits if the vox populi turns against them. Conversely, if the Twitter poll asks them to stay, the bands should be required to tour forever, like Bob Dylan, the Eagles and the Rolling Stones. This is a clear-cut case of Be Careful What You Wish For. And it might constitute senior abuse.</p><p>2. Should Jerry Jones take a hike? Like Kiss, the Dallas Cowboys owner has been around since the Dawn of Creation, to no great purpose. He's annoying, he's ubiquitous, and his team chokes in the playoffs every year. So why is he still here? Let Twitter decide his fate.</p><p>3. Should McDonald's Pumpkin Spice Latte be on the menu all-year-round? For a lot of people, nothing is worse than pulling into a fast-food joint and finding that certain beloved limited-time offerings have vanished from the menu. Why shouldn't we be able to enjoy Peppermint Mocha all through the year and not just at Christmas? Why is Pizza Hut's Detroit Style Pizza only on offer a few weeks a year? These are the sorts of problems only Twitter can resolve.</p><p>4. Should Roger Goodell step down as NFL Commissioner? Every year when Goodell steps up to the podium at the National Football League draft he is fiercely booed by a substantial portion of the audience. Is Goodell really hated by football fans or is this just a stupid tradition carried on by a small group of jerks, the same kinds of people who yell \"Free Bird\" even at performances of \"La Traviata\"? How about letting Twitter get to the bottom of this vexing issue?</p><p>5. Shouldn't it be illegal to work as a wedding DJ?</p><p>Other issues that could be resolved by a studiously scientific Twitter poll include: Should red-light cameras be banned, given that everyone seems to hate them? Should Aaron Boone resign as Yankees coach, given that everyone seems to hate him? Should soccer travel teams be banned, same reason? Should at least one of the Kardashians go away? Should Anthony Fauci retire? Clarence Thomas? Aaron Rodgers? Elmo? The woman in the Progressive Insurance commercials?</p><p>Can Twitter decide once and for all to vote the word \"awesome\" out of the English language? How about \"iconic?\" If a Twitter poll decides that the expression \"Have a good one\" is maddening and stupid, can everyone working in customer service or retail be legally required to stop saying it?</p><p>On a personal note, I would like Twitter -- or at least Twitter Blue -- to decide whether anyone anywhere should ever be permitted to play steel drums in public. A subsequent Twitter poll would decide the fate of the banjo.</p>",
