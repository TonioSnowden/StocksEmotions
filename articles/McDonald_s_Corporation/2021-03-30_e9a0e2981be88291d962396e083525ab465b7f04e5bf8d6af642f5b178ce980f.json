  "text": "<p>Forget burgers and plant-based meat. The fiercest food fight among US chain eateries is over who can serve up the best fried chicken sandwich.</p> <p>McDonald's is looking to ruffle feathers. Last month it launched not one but three versions of the concoction. The push into poultry comes as the Golden Arches looks to juice up pandemic-hit sales. The $170bn burger chain may be one of the world's most recognised brands but it has only managed to post top-line growth in one out of the past seven years. Like-for-like sales were up just 0.4 per cent in the US last year and down 7.7 per cent overall.</p> <p>Meanwhile, US fast-food chicken sales are booming. The meat is seen as healthy, even though it ceases to be when battered and fried. Sales hit $30bn last year. They are expected to reach $43.2bn by 2025, according to IbisWorld. Americans ordered about <a href=\"https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/2021/while-chicken-sandwich-wars-in-the-us-intensify-burgers-still-rule-the-roost/\">2.5bn crispy chicken sandwiches</a> last year, data from the NPD Group show.</p> <p>Chick-fil-A is the undisputed master of the chicken sandwich. The privately held company pulled in $12.2bn in sales in 2019, making it the third-biggest US restaurant or café chain behind McDonald's and Starbucks, says food-service consultancy Technomic.</p> <p>Popeyes, owned by Restaurant Brands International, rolled out its own fried chicken sandwich in the summer of 2019. The instant popularity of its offering helped lift sales 18 per cent to $5.1bn last year and raised the chain's profile. </p> <p>McDonald's is low in the pecking order when it comes to fried chicken. But, if successful, its new sandwiches could help boost sales at an average location by as much as 4.2 per cent, according to Credit Suisse.</p> <p>Investors should not count their chickens before they hatch. At 27 times forward earnings, McDonald's shares are already trading at the upper end of the sector's valuation. Popeyes' success has prompted Wendy's, KFC, Burger King and even Taco Bell to launch new chicken sandwiches. It is going to be a crowded market to stand out in.</p> <p><em>If you are a subscriber and would like to receive alerts when Lex articles are published, just click the button ‘Add to myFT', which appears at the top of this page above the headline</em></p> <p><strong>​Letter in response to this column</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70614fdc-fed5-46f3-86ec-fb449d3ad597\"><em>McDonald's puts its finances on the menu</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70614fdc-fed5-46f3-86ec-fb449d3ad597\"><em>From Michael Gonda, Chief Communications Officer, McDonald's, Chicago, IL, US</em></a></p><p>Source:  2021 'McDonald's/fried chicken: burger giant plots move up the pecking order' FT.com 30 March.
