  "title": "World News:  McDonald's in Russia Reopens Under New Ownership  ----  By Ann M. Simmons, Yuliya Chernova and Heather Haddon",
  "text": "<p>   MOSCOW -- More than a dozen former McDonald's restaurants reopened here under a new brand and new ownership, accompanied by a marketing blitz aimed at convincing Russians that the new chain's burgers are as good as the American version. </p><p>   Officials also used the reopenings -- including that of McDonald's first restaurant in Russia, near Moscow's Pushkin Square -- to project a narrative of Russian economic resilience in the face of international sanctions and an exodus of Western businesses from the country. McDonald's Corp. and other Western companies have pulled out of Russia in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. They have cited a number of reasons for doing so, including the difficulty of doing business in Russia amid the sanctions. </p><p>   \"We will maintain the quality and level of service that guests have become accustomed to over the years,\" said Alexander Govor, a Siberian businessman and the new owner, at a press conference ahead of the reopenings on Sunday. </p><p>   Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin had previously said the rebranded chain would keep the same menu, staff and standards. It will continue to use \"our chickens, patties, bread, tomatoes and cucumbers,\" he said, Russian state media reported. \"We just need to add it all up the right way, package it, and sell it.\" </p><p>   McDonald's holds symbolic importance in Russia. It was among the first Western brands to open its doors amid the crumbling of the Soviet Union, offering Russians their first taste of Western consumerism. In 1990, about 30,000 people lined up for the opening at Pushkin Square. Thirty-two years later, the company is now a trailblazer again in Russia, as one of the first Western brands to transfer its operations to local ownership. </p><p>   The new chain in recent days released its new logo, replacing McDonald's Golden Arches. It resembles the letter M, formed by a red dot and two slanting yellow lines. The new owners unveiled the chain's new name on Sunday: \"Vkusno &amp; tochka\", which translates to \"Tasty &amp; that's it.\" </p><p>   The reopening provides a high-profile platform for Russian officials to highlight what they say is the country's ability to weather sanctions and its pariah-state status among Western businesses. Moscow is making extra payments to pensioners, state employees and others to help protect them from the fallout from sanctions. It is also backing state-subsidized loans to companies. Russia's central bank, meanwhile, has stabilized the ruble, which has recovered from a sharp selloff after the invasion. </p><p>   That has all created an air of normalcy to Moscow life. Grocery stores remain largely stocked with staples and imported goods. Restaurants in the capital have continued to attract large crowds, filling patios as warmer temperatures set in. </p><p>   The push by Russian officials and executives to keep domestic businesses going amid sanctions is part of a wider economic war of attrition with the West. That is playing out far from the actual battlefield, but it could have big implications for the real fighting, too. Moscow's war effort has so far been underpinned financially by Russia's oil and natural-gas revenue, swollen by today's higher prices. But officials need also to keep other Russian businesses humming to avoid a serious economic downturn that could endanger the war's financing over the long haul, if necessary, and to bolster public support for the effort. </p><p>   McDonald's said in May it had agreed to sell its hundreds of restaurants and other Russian assets to Mr. Govor. It didn't disclose a price. Other big brands such as Starbucks Corp. and Marriott International Inc. have also since announced they would wrap up their business in Russia. </p><p>   Mr. Govor previously ran a McDonald's franchise in Siberia. He has invested in an oil refinery, a surgical center and a hotel in the industrial region of Kemerovo, also known as Kuzbass, in southwestern Siberia. He has a 50% stake in the oil company Neftekhimservice, according to a spokeswoman for that business. Mr. Govor's son, Roman Govor, is a representative in the regional Kuzbass parliament from Russia's ruling party, United Russia. </p><p>   McDonald's said in March it had 62,000 employees in Russia and operated 847 restaurants there. The company cultivated a network of local suppliers, which employed tens of thousands of people, Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said in May. </p><p>   Mr. Govor, the new owner, said he plans to reopen all the former McDonald's stores in Russia and hit 1,000 restaurants over the next five to six years. He said he has kept on all the Russian business's employees. </p><p>   McDonald's retains the right to buy its Russian restaurants back within 15 years, according to Russia's antimonopoly service, which approved the takeover. The company declined to comment about that option. </p><p></p>",
