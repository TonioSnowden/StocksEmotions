  "text": "<p>McDonald's Corp. needs to make sure its burgers and coffee don't grow too expensive for customers, its chief executive said, as restaurant owners raise menu prices to offset their own rising costs...</p><p>Restaurants and food companies are trying to balance raising prices to offset more expensive ingredients and wages against consumers' ability and willingness to pay higher prices. U.S. inflation hit a new four-decade high in March, driven by surging food and energy costs, as well as supply-chain constraints.</p><p>McDonald's Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said the company is focused on remaining a good value for diners, particularly for low-income customers who are more likely to notice inflation.</p><p>\"We've always got to stay competitive on value,\" Mr. Kempczinski said. \"When we lose sight of that, there's a long history of that being where we've kind of gotten off track.\"</p><p>The latest demand to veer off track is coming from a billionaire who doesn't eat at McDonald's but wants to force a more expensive menu on the people who do. The Journal's Cara Lombardo recently reported:</p><p>Carl Icahn is urging BlackRock Inc. and other big index-fund managers focused on socially conscious investing to support his proxy fight at McDonald's Corp. for better treatment of pregnant pigs.</p><p>The billionaire activist investor, who has a McDonald's stake worth roughly $50,000, nominated two directors to the fast-food chain's board in February as part of his campaign, a departure from his typical fights for changes in financial strategy and the like...</p><p>McDonald's says what Mr. Icahn is demanding is unfeasible because the company would require 300 to 400 times the number of animals currently housed without crates. It said such a move would significantly increase its costs and place a financial burden on its customers.</p><p>Can you imagine the gall of someone sitting onan estimated $16 billion fortune claiming that it's \"socially conscious\" to force price increases on middle- and lower-income diners while inflation is raging at an annual rate of 8.5%?</p><p>Fight on, Mr. Kempczinski!</p><p>***</p><p>Remind Us Again Why We Should Trust an Iran Nuclear Deal McClatchy's Michael Wilner reports from Washington:</p><p>Iran's attempts to assassinate former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are real and ongoing, his successor, Antony Blinken, told Congress on Tuesday.</p><p>Testifying before a Senate panel, Blinken acknowledged details made public last month in a sensitive State Department report that outlined a security arrangement for the former secretary involving round-the-clock government protection.</p><p>\"I'm not sure what I can say in an open setting, but let me say generically that there is an ongoing threat against American officials, both present and past,\" Blinken said. \"We are making sure and we will make sure for as long as it takes that we're protecting our people, present and former, if they're under threat.\"</p><p>***</p><p>University Subsidies in One Lesson Adam Ozimek of the Economic Innovation Group tweets:</p><p>If we are forgiving student debt because the student got a bad deal, the program that they went to should be banned from student loans.</p><p>If the degree they got pays for itself, then they don't need forgiveness. If it doesn't, access to that program shouldn't be subsidized in the future.</p><p>***</p><p>Gone Country On another topic, the work of Mr. Ozimek's colleague August Benzow is featured in a Yahoo Finance dispatch from Grace O'Donnell and Adriana Belmonte, who report today:</p><p>Americans leaving urban counties reached a new high in 2021... Exurban counties saw the biggest increase across the board, with about 80% gaining population. These counties are defined as areas with \"a population smaller than 50,000, at least 25 percent of their population in a large or medium-sized suburb, and must be in a metro with a population of 500,000 or higher.\"</p><p>\"While there has been much discussion of a flight to the suburbs, the share of suburban counties growing actually declined,\" the report stated. \"Instead, exurban and rural counties saw a rising share of counties that gained population, with non-metropolitan rural counties seeing the highest population gain since 2008.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Is Florida No Longer a Swing State? Alex Roarty and Bianca Padró Ocasio report in the Miami Herald on a new worry among Democrats:</p><p>Liberal grassroots groups in Florida are reducing staff and scaling back voter-outreach efforts because of a growing reluctance from out-of-state donors to spend money on the state, say top progressive strategists.</p><p>If the financial pull back continues, they warn, it threatens not only the party's chances in this year's slate of midterm races but also Florida's place as a top-tier battleground in the 2024 presidential election...</p><p>Concerns about Democrats' competitiveness in Florida have festered on the left ever since former President Donald Trump's victory here in 2016. But liberal strategists say that, while it's not too late to turn things around, what they're seeing now makes them concerned that Florida is entering a dangerous new phase, in which the failure of past elections saps resources for future races and makes winning even harder -- pushing the party into a kind of death spiral here that could turn a former swing state into one Republicans dominate for a generation.</p><p>***</p><p>Not the Babylon Bee 'St. Olaf ousts faculty director of institute dedicated to bringing controversial speakers to campus — because speakers caused controversy,\" April 26, theFIRE.org</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.)</p><p>Thank You, McDonald's</p>",
