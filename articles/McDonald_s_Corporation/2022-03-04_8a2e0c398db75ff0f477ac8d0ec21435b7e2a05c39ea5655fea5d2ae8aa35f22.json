  "title": "Estée Lauder Executive Led Global Expansion; Jeanette Sarkisian Wagner, who has died at age 92, led the international division of the New York-based cosmetics maker",
  "text": "<p>When Mrs. Wagner became international chief in 1986, Estée Lauder's sales outside the U.S. were modest. Now the Americas division accounts for only about a quarter of Estée Lauder's global sales, and the company's biggest markets are Asia and Europe.</p><p>She finished her career as vice chairman of the company and retired in January 2002 at age 72.</p><p>The daughter of Armenian immigrants who ran grocery stores in Chicago, she was known for her red-framed eyeglasses, big bracelets and general panache. On overseas trips, she worked from dawn until late at night, and chided laggards by declaring that \"jet lag is boring.\" Colleagues described her as a good mentor who set steep goals for herself and others.</p><p>\"She was intimidating—particularly to men,\" Rochelle Bloom, a former Estée Lauder executive, said.</p><p>Mrs. Wagner, who had homes in Manhattan and Sag Harbor, N.Y., died Feb. 26. She was 92.</p><p>\"She brought an attitude that anything is possible,\" said Fred Langhammer, a former chief executive of Estée Lauder.</p><p>Mrs. Wagner jetted around the world to set up outlets for Estée Lauder, Clinique and other brands. In 1989, the company began supplying merchandise to a Russian-owned boutique featuring Estée Lauder products near Moscow's Red Square, about two months before McDonald's arrived. Though the perfume was priced at about two weeks of average pay, women thronged the store.</p><p>Mrs. Wagner discovered the company was introducing new colors overseas long after they had been rolled out at home. She ended that practice. In the fashion business, she decreed, that was unthinkable.</p><p>Jeanette Sarkisian was born July 2, 1929, in Chicago. As a child, she helped her parents with grocery deliveries. In a 2000 interview with the Los Angeles Times, she recalled her father telling her, \"Never take a tip. This is part of the service.\"</p><p>She earned a bachelor's degree at Northwestern University, where she studied English, and planned a writing career. First, however, she briefly worked at the Bonwit Teller department store in Chicago as a guide for men seeking gifts for women. \"Men are more honest than women,\" she told the Chicago Tribune in 1951. \"They have good taste, buy more expensive things, make up their minds faster, and seldom return merchandise.\"</p><p>She later worked as an editor for the Chicago Daily News and the Saturday Evening Post. At Hearst Corp., she was responsible for international editions of Cosmopolitan and other magazines.</p><p>She married Paul Alexander Wagner, a public relations executive, in 1965. After retirement, they ran a consulting service, Nulli Secundus Associates, to offer free advice to nonprofits. Mr. Wagner died in 2015. Mrs. Wagner is survived by two stepchildren.</p><p>At the John Jermain Memorial Library in Sag Harbor, she sponsored writing workshops for teenagers.</p><p>Write to James R.
