  "title": "The NFL's Go-To Tailor? A Former Accountant From New Jersey; Meet the self-taught suitmaker putting players from Jimmy Garoppolo to Dak Prescott into truly bespoke suits—down to no-one-else-has-it fabric",
  "text": "<p>This season, NFL players including Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, Denver Broncos free safety Justin Simmons and Cincinnati Bengals defensive end Sam Hubbard have marched into the locker room wearing Gentleman's Playbook suits. Also calling up the brand for custom clothes? Wrestling greats like Ric Flair and baseball juggernauts such as Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Noah Syndergaard.</p><p>\"Dressing is a sport,\" said Mr. Marchitelli during an interview, repeating a mantra picked up from one of his many pro athlete clients. And there are hundreds of them: He estimated that 180 professional football players and 70 athletes each from the National Hockey League and Major League Baseball have Gentleman's Playbook suits hanging in their closets. Add to them a handful or so of pro wrestlers and NBA players, and Mr. Marchitelli might be the biggest custom clothier in America to specifically target the pro sports world.</p><p>\"I'm a profit maximizer,\" said Mr. Marchitelli, sounding like the money manager he once was. While he said that he has 20 or so clients who don't make a living storming into the end zone or blocking a slap shot, he has largely focused his business on high-earning athletes who can afford to splash around on 20 or 30 suits at a time. At between $2,795 and $5,000 a pop, Mr. Marchitelli has built a lean, moneymaking customwear business. </p><p>'The majority of them, absolutely the flashier the better,' said Tom Marchitelli of the clothing he makes. Once he sells a suit in one fabric, it's off the table for another customer. PHOTO: OK McCausland for WSJ. Magazine</p><p>Ten years ago he was just another financial-world striver, bored at his day job. \"I wasn't challenged and it certainly wasn't my passion,\" he said of working at a hedge fund, which he declined to name.</p><p>His passion, as epitomized by the sculpted, three-piece suit he wore during our interview, was tailoring. For years, Mr. Marchitelli was an avid consumer of custom suits, purchasing them in pugnacious plaids from New York-area tailors. He was a corporate desk jockey who dressed like one of the peacocks at Pitti Uomo.</p><p>He took pride in his peak-lapeled collection and, about nine years ago, started an Instagram under the name Gentleman's Playbook to show them off. After his photos were reposted on other suit-centric accounts, he quickly built an audience of about 100,000 followers, including some tailoring-curious athletes. A couple of years in, one of them, Chase Daniel, a journeyman quarterback now with the Los Angeles Chargers, messaged Mr. Marchitelli to ask if he could make the NFLer some suits.</p><p>He immediately agreed—but there was one problem. Mr. Marchitelli didn't know how to make a custom suit for someone else. He didn't even know how to take measurements, the most elemental skill of a made-to-measure specialist.</p><p>\"I had two weeks to get a manufacturer and to learn how to measure,\" he said.</p><p>Fortunately, around that time a suit manufacturer in Los Angeles had messaged Mr. Marchitelli about collaborating with them on apparel. The company agreed to produce Mr. Marchitelli's suits under the Gentleman's Playbook label and sent out a tailoring veteran to train him on measuring clients so his sportcoats wouldn't arrive with, say, shrunken sleeves or a flabby chest. That couple-day tutorial is the full extent of his formal fashion training.</p><p>To that end, Mr. Marchitelli is still not a tailor, as he doesn't sew or alter suits himself. He is a designer and stylist who guides the look of a suit for a client and has it produced by a separate company.</p><p>He met up with Mr. Daniel in Kansas City, Mo., where the quarterback purchased two suits in beige and blue. With that, Gentleman's Playbook was off. A college friend who played hockey connected him with suit-seeking New Jersey Devils players. Across professional leagues, his name was passed along in locker rooms when someone asked, \"Where'd you get that suit?\" After a year and a half, he said he had enough clients to quit his day job.</p><p>Mr. Marchitelli also became an Instagram direct-message machine. \"I would DM a whole team,\" he said, a tactic that he still employs today: On the day before our interview, he said he messaged about 50 basketball players on Instagram, hoping to wrangle them into one (or 20) of his suits.</p><p>Those that tap Mr. Marchitelli to handle their tailoring say he has a distinct grasp of their herculean physiques.</p><p>\"I don't have the easiest body to fit,\" said Shannon Sharpe, a retired Hall of Fame tight end who has remained in playing shape during his postretirement career as a TV commentator. He praised Mr. Marchitelli for being \"very meticulous\" in framing a suit around his hulking shoulders and trim waist. \"I don't have any complaints with the fit,\" said Mr. Sharpe.</p><p>Nor does Ric Flair, the ever-raffish wrestling legend who said he has purchased 10 suits from Gentleman's Playbook this year alone. \"He's made me the best suits I've ever had and he can get European fabrics made here [into suits] in the States in a week,\" said Mr. Flair, who, true to his reputation as wrestling's most flamboyant kingpin, continues to wear a new suit at almost every public appearance. \"I just like to have something nobody else is wearing and that stands out.\"</p><p>Clients often treat dressing as a competition. Just as they want to beat their coverage on the field, they want to outdress their teammates during that three-minute walk to the locker room—particularly when the cameras are out. One photo in the right, attention-grabbing suit can turn an NFL backbencher into a style luminary.</p><p>Some of the lurid suits Mr. Marchitelli has made for athletes push the limits of good taste. He recently put Broncos wide receiver Courtland Sutton in a marigold tapestry pattern that made him look like he was wearing a chunk of wall from a Victorian castle. And Mr. Simmons's teammate Bradley Chubb has an eye-assaulting gold suit from Mr. Marchitelli. They're looks that may not have flown at the hedge fund, but for these athletes, the garish designs are just right.</p><p>\"The majority of them, absolutely the flashier the better,\" said Mr. Marchitelli, who noted that once he sells a suit in one fabric, it's off the table for another customer.</p><p>That's the kind of careful service that his competitive clients value. \"It's important for me to get [a fabric] before others do,\" said Mr. Prescott of the Cowboys, who wore an extravagant silk suit from Gentleman's Playbook to his first game of this NFL season. </p><p>Tom Marchitelli's fittings take place in athletes' homes, where they're most comfortable. Most of his clients, he said, don't even know he lives in New Jersey. PHOTO: OK McCausland for WSJ. Magazine</p><p>Another sweetener for athletes? As Mr. Marchitelli is a gym rat himself, he is willing to cut a suit slim (perhaps slimmer than any nonathlete would be comfortable with) to show off all those hours spent in the weight room.</p><p>\"As athletes we work hard for our figure,\" said Mr. Prescott, who has purchased so many Gentleman's Playbook suits that he was embarrassed to say an exact number.</p><p>For key clients like the Cowboys quarterback, Mr. Marchitelli sits down with them before a season starts to lay out weeks' worth of outfits. \"It's strategic, we have the schedule printed out: all right, we're going to be in L.A., we need a lighter, flashier suit. OK, now we're in the winter, we're going to go flannel suits,\" said the designer, who also produces shirts, sweaters and jackets for clients.</p><p>These sessions exclusively take place in an athlete's home where they're most comfortable. For that reason, he sees no need to open a bricks-and-mortar store. Most of his clients, he said, don't even know he lives in New Jersey.</p><p>Still, Mr. Marchitelli conceded that he hasn't yet fully cracked the league most closely tied to fashion: the NBA. Basketball players are just more into Gucci tracksuits or Balenciaga hoodies than whatever Gentleman's Playbook can offer them.</p><p>\"In the last six, seven years it's been more casual and more casual,\" in the NBA, said Mr. Marchitelli with a bit of a sigh. His hope is that LeBron James, who already has shown a bit of a taste for Thom Browne suits, will go full tailoring—and all those other players that look up to him will follow. \"I'm just waiting for that cycle to turn,\" he said. Until then, he'll keep firing off DMs.</p><p>Write to Jacob Gallagher at jacob.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>More in On Trend</p><p>* With Adult Happy Meals, McDonald's Sparks a Collecting Frenzy</p><p>* Levi's Jeans From the 1880s, Sold for $76,000, Reveal a Complicated History</p><p>* The $100 Sunglasses Minting Millions From 1980s Nostalgia</p><p>* The Beer Koozie-Like Shoe Selling Out Across America</p><p>* The Clothes That Make the King</p><p>The NFL's Go-To Tailor?
