  "title": "Business News: McDonald's Hires Firm For Diversity Review",
  "text": "<p>The proposal came as McDonald's, the largest U.S. restaurant company by sales, has dealt with criticism over its handling of racial matters, and as investors have pressed other major companies to assess their records on race and related matters.</p><p>McDonald's reported in a filing Thursday that about 274 million shares of the company's common stock were voted in favor of the proposed audit, based on a preliminary tally following the company's annual shareholder meeting last week.</p><p>About 217 million shares were voted against the proposal, with about six million abstaining. Bloomberg earlier reported on preliminary tallies of the vote.</p><p>McDonald's said that diversity and inclusion were central to the company's values, and it was committed to providing opportunities for employees, franchisees and suppliers.</p><p>\"While we are proud of our progress, our efforts are ongoing, and we will continue to focus on actions that have meaningful impact,\" the company said.</p><p>SOC said in its proposal that McDonald's should solicit input from franchisees, employees, suppliers and customers and make its findings public.</p><p>Civil-rights audits evaluate company policies pertaining to race, sexual orientation, gender and other characteristics, the group said.</p><p>McDonald's had said in a separate filing before the vote that such an audit wouldn't provide a benefit to shareholders, as the company had already committed itself to new standards for conduct across its operations.</p>",
