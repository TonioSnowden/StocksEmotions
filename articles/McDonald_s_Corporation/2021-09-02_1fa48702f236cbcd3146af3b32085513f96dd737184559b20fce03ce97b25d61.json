  "text": "<p>James Simons —the quantitative-investing pioneer&#xa0;who started Renaissance before&#xa0;retiring as the firm's chairman&#xa0;on Jan. 1—will make an additional “settlement payment” of $670 million, according to the firm. Simons will also pay back taxes related to his gains from the trades in question.</p><p>The dispute relates to moves the firm's key Medallion fund took between 2005 and 2015 to convert short-term trading gains into long-term profits. It has been closely followed in the worlds of finance and politics because of the enormous amounts involved and because Renaissance's leaders are among the largest political donors in the U.S.</p><p>Simons has been a long-term supporter of Democratic candidates—while Robert Mercer, another Renaissance executive, has backed Republican causes, including former President&#xa0;Donald Trump.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>SPAC rout erases $75 billion in startup value.</p><p>McDonald's McFlurry machine is broken (again).
