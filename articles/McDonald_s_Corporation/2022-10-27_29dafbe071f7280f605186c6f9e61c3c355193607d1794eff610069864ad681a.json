  "title": "McDonald's Global Revenue Takes Hit From Currency Shifts; Price increases and marketing boost U.S. sales, but CEO sees uncertain business outlook",
  "text": "<p>The Chicago-based restaurant company said global same-store sales increased 9.5% during the quarter compared with the same period last year. Same-store sales increases in markets including the U.S., Germany, Australia and France were offset by challenges in China due to renewed government Covid-19 restrictions there, the chain said.</p><p>McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said the company's business was strong despite broader economic uncertainties.</p><p>For the third quarter, McDonald's reported earnings of $2.68 per share on income of $1.98 billion, which fell 8% from the prior year's period. Per-share earnings were flat during the third quarter compared with the same period last year when accounting for foreign currencies, the company said. The company beat analysts' earnings expectations for the quarter.</p><p>An increasing number of American companies are reporting lower quarterly sales as the strong U.S. dollar depresses the value of revenue generated in foreign markets. For U.S. companies operating overseas, sales in the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and other currencies are worth less in dollars now because of shifting exchange rates.</p><p>Mr. Kempczinski said last month that he was troubled by rising inflation and predicted a more challenging business outlook in 2023, particularly in Europe. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CEO Brian Niccol said Tuesday he expected a broader slowdown in consumer demand in the coming year, and though it has raised prices, the chain is promoting the restaurant brand's value.</p><p>McDonald's said that marketing featuring the company's core menu helped generate sales and bring in more orders in the U.S. during the quarter. Price increases also helped the company's revenue, the company said. In April, McDonald's said its U.S. locations had increased menu prices by an average of 8% in the first quarter compared with the same period last year.</p><p>McDonald's said its exit from its Russian business led to a pretax charge of $1.28 billion for the nine months ended Sept. 30, while the sale of its Dynamic Yield technology system generated a $271 million gain.</p><p>Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com</p><p>McDonald's Global Revenue Takes Hit From Currency Shifts</p>",
