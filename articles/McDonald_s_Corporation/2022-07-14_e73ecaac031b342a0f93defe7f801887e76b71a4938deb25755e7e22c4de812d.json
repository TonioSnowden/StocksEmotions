  "title": "The $1.50 Costco Hot Dog Combo That Defies Inflation; The warehouse club's popular food court item has stayed the same price since its debut in 1985 despite rising food costs",
  "text": "<p>\"That $1.50 price point has been sacrosanct from the very beginning,\" said Richard Galanti, chief financial officer at Costco.</p><p>He said the company sells about 130 million hot dogs annually at its food courts within its 833 warehouses. \"It's become somewhat of a signature item for us,\" he said.</p><p>The warehouse club recently raised the food court price on individual sodas, chicken bakes and whole pizzas because of rising costs, Mr. Galanti said. He declined to say whether Costco would raise prices of other items.</p><p>Resilient shoppers have given Costco and other retailers a boost of late despite rising inflation. Costco reported $51.61 billion in sales for the most recent quarter, a 16% increase from the same period in the prior year. The company attributed the growth to more consumer spending on fuel, fresh food and home furnishing items.</p><p>Like other big-box retailers and restaurants, Costco has been feeling price pressures as food costs rise. Some McDonald's Corp. locations, for instance, are removing the chain's U.S. deal offering soda and other cold beverages for a buck.</p><p>Costco is also dealing with higher costs for buying products from vendors, freight, labor and electricity, Mr. Galanti said.</p><p>Mr. Galanti declined to say whether the company intends to raise membership fees, which start at $60 a year. He noted that the company typically increases membership fees about every five years. The company last raised its fees in 2017.</p><p>The hot dog combo, however, is off limits.</p><p>If the price of the hot dog combo kept up with the rate of inflation, it would cost about $4.13 today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The cost of hot dogs was up 16% at the end of June, compared with a year ago, according to BLS data.</p><p>Costco originally sold kosher beef hot dogs when the hot dog combo made its debut in the 1980s, Mr. Galanti said. The company was selling so many hot dogs that it decided to build its own hot dog factory in central California to increase its supply and lower costs. Costco opened the plant in Tracy, Calif., in 2011 and switched to making a non-kosher beef hot dog, he said.</p><p>Now Costco's 250,000-square-foot hot dog plant in Tracy makes two items—a large hot dog that gets sold at Costco's food courts and regular-sized hot dogs that the warehouse club sells in packs, Mr. Galanti said.</p><p>Costco added hot dog capacity at a meat plant in Morris, Ill., in 2018, Mr. Galanti said. The meat plants in Illinois and California are now churning out about 300 million hot dogs a year, Mr. Galanti said.</p><p>Even Costco's co-founder has had strong feelings about the frankfurter.</p><p>At a 2018 luncheon, Costco chief executive W. Craig Jelinek recounted how he once told the company's co-founder Jim Sinegal they needed to raise the price of hot dogs.</p><p>\"I said, 'Jim, we can't sell this hot dog for a buck fifty,'\" Mr. Jelinek said. \"'We are losing our rear ends.' And he said, 'If you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out.' That's all I really needed.\"</p><p>Mr. Galanti said he's never heard Mr. Sinegal deny that story.</p><p>Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation, said loss leaders—or products sold below market value to entice customers to purchase other items—are a standard strategy employed by large retailers.</p><p>Given the pace of inflation, retailers will likely be relying on this marketing strategy to get consumers to shop for the coming holiday season, Mr. Kleinhenz said.</p><p>\"I'm expecting that we will be using marketing strategies like this to keep people enticed and coming into stores,\" Mr. Kleinhenz said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What's a Costco hot dog worth to you? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Costco's CFO wouldn't directly say whether food court items were loss leaders.</p><p>\"Needless to say we aren't making a lot or any\" money on the food courts, Mr. Galanti said. \"At the end of the day, the whole value of our warehouse club includes a great value on that hot dog and soda.\"</p><p>The hot dog combo brings in Costco fans like Santiago Almeida, who said he eats a hot dog from the retailer about every other week. He said the combo is one of his go-to dinner options to feed his 6-year-old son, who can be picky about what he eats.</p><p>\"We go to Costco just to have a hot dog,\" said Mr. Almeida, a 48-year-old lawyer from Charleston, S.C. \"You can't beat the price.\"</p><p>Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com</p><p>The $1.50 Costco Hot Dog Combo That Defies Inflation</p>",
