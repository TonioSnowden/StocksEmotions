  "text": "<p>All would face significant new costs -- exactly how much is unknown -- and it is unclear how much would be subsidized by government tax policies or incentives, since the Biden administration has yet to detail how it would seek to reach its aggressive new goal.</p><p>Sectors that appear most directly affected by Mr. Biden's emissions pledge -- including agriculture, transportation, oil and gas extraction, utilities, and chemical and plastics manufacturing -- collectively make up more than 10% of the nation's $21 trillion gross domestic product, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data. The costs of the related energy and raw materials they produce affect nearly every corner of the economy. Transportation generates 29% of U.S. emissions, followed by electricity generation at 25% and industry at 23%, according to the Environmental Protection Agency's annual inventory of greenhouse-gas emissions. \"This is a real sea change in the degree of ambition by the U.S. government; it is pretty monumental,\" said Richard Newell, president and chief executive of Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan think tank. \"This is technically feasible but a substantial acceleration of existing trends.\"</p><p>At an Earth Day climate summit this week, Mr. Biden called for slashing U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions by 50% to 52% compared with the baseline year of 2005, as he seeks to put America at the forefront of world-wide efforts to combat climate change.</p><p>Mr. Biden's target is a significant ratcheting up of the goal articulated by former President Barack Obama -- a 26% to 28% cut by 2025 -- to help put the U.S. on a path to comply with the Paris agreement, which seeks to limit average global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.</p><p>His actions have received support from numerous big businesses, many of which have pledged recently to cut their own emissions. In an open letter to Mr. Biden, dozens of companies including McDonald's Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google said a more ambitious climate target would \"guide the U.S. government's approach to more sustainable and resilient infrastructure, zero-emissions vehicles and buildings, improved agricultural practices, and durable carbon removal.\"</p><p>But they have also raised concerns among representatives for some of the large industries that would be most heavily affected, who have called them unrealistic.</p><p>Academics, business consultants and others who study U.S. emissions say that meeting Mr. Biden's targets would require significant changes in two key areas: how the U.S. generates electricity and how it powers its cars and trucks.</p><p>The transportation and warehouse sector, which makes up roughly 2.8% of the economy, is also getting cleaner, thanks largely to tightening fuel-economy standards and a growing push by major auto makers to invest in electric vehicles. But it too would need to speed up changes to meet Mr. Biden's target.</p><p>According to a new Boston Consulting Group report, the U.S. is on a path to reduce light-vehicle emissions by 50% in 2035. To move that up five years will require ongoing incentives to purchase electric vehicles, but also the return of a cash-for-clunkers type program, the report concluded.</p><p>Top U.S. auto makers have already committed to raising EV output. Ford for instance said earlier this year that it was committing $22 billion to electric vehicles and the digital technology involved in connecting them to the internet by 2025.</p><p>\"Ford supports lowering U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions 50% by 2030,\" said spokesman T. R. Reid. But putting more electric vehicles on the road will require a dependable supply of batteries and semiconductors, he added. \"We're involved in real-time discussions with the administration about long-term availability of those key components.\"</p><p>Other challenges remain. The U.S. would need a huge expansion of electric-vehicle charging stations before such cars could reach a mass market.</p><p>In the power sector utilities sector, which makes up roughly 1.6% of GDP, renewable energy is already on the rise, fueled in part by falling costs for wind and solar farms, but also subsidies and state-level mandates.</p><p>In 2020, 39.5% of U.S. electricity came from zero-carbon emitting sources such as nuclear, wind and solar, up from 29.9% a decade earlier, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.</p><p>One of the most affected industries would be the American oil and gas sector, which raised its output substantially over the past decade, thanks to fracking, boosting the economies of states such as Texas and North Dakota. Oil and gas extraction directly makes up roughly 0.6% of GDP, while chemicals and plastics, largely made from fossil fuels, account for 1.9% and 0.4%, respectively.</p><p>Agriculture, which makes up nearly 1% of the economy, contributes about 10% of annual U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, according to the EPA, and relative to other industries has faced fewer government mandates to reduce its carbon footprint.</p><p>Big meat and grain-processing companies have set voluntary targets in response to consumer and investor pressure, but many farmers remain resistant to regulations centered on farms and feedlots.</p><p>JBS SA, the world's largest meat company, believes its voluntary efforts to curb emissions across its U.S. beef and pork operations are aligned with the Biden administration's target, according to Cameron Bruett, the company's U.S. chief sustainability officer.</p><p>The most difficult major category to reduce emissions may be heavy industry. Steel, cement and petrochemical manufacturing require large amounts of energy and emit substantial emissions.</p><p>Emily Grubert, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, says reducing industrial emissions will be costly.</p><p>\"This is the place where we might actually think about doing some really expensive things,\" she said.</p><p>---</p><p>Jacob Bunge contributed to this article.</p>",
