But experts say replacing the loss of Chinese listings will be difficult.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas. Here's the rest of today's news — Gordon</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Vladimir Putin warns Nato of military response </strong>The Russian president yesterday warned of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e5e9624-b7d7-4c11-bc12-4078a6d293bb\">“appropriate military-technical measures”</a> to counter the threat of Nato's expansion eastward, in a ratcheting up of tensions with the western alliance. The US said it would start diplomatic talks in an attempt to ease fears of conflict over Ukraine. </p> <p><strong>2. Nikola pays $125m to settle SEC fraud charges</strong> The electric truck start-up agreed to pay $125m to settle charges that it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec4cbb58-d41c-4487-a24a-8ac8ce088375\">defrauded investors</a> by misleading them on the capabilities of its vehicles. </p> <p><strong>3. Calpers chief says hedge fund fees remain ‘problematic'</strong> Marcie Frost, chief executive of Calpers, told the Financial Times the US's biggest public pension plan <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f71d21aa-82f5-47f9-ad3b-c1b41779e50e\">would not be turning to hedge funds</a> to help weather the likely shift in global monetary policy in the coming year.</p> <p><strong>4.

Dubai's ruler ordered to pay £554m to settle divorce </strong>Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the billionaire ruler of Dubai, must pay about £554m in child maintenance and security costs to his estranged wife Princess Haya and their two children, in what is believed to be the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cd89c4a-159f-4c55-9f8a-8e54099cdf65\">largest post-divorce financial settlement</a> awarded by an English court.</p> <h1>Coronavirus digest</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Joe Biden</strong> said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/306ff143-e05d-4972-81c4-4db52a7fad22\">500m rapid at-home tests</a> would be sent to US households to help slow the rise of Omicron cases.

But the transatlantic co-operation <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03a2df73-da6a-4bc5-b242-dd3ea71bcd6a\">has raised alarm in US boardrooms</a>.</p> <p><strong>Lax rules are allowing corporate fat cats to dump stock</strong> Profiting from a historic run up in share prices, US corporate insiders sold a record $69bn in shares this year, up 30 per cent from 2020, and 79 per cent more than the 10-year average. These <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a736a118-4f06-4bf2-9a27-0bfe029804c3\">corporate fat cats</a> are certainly in the money, writes Brooke Masters, but are they also in the know, she asks. </p> <p><strong>Will the US help the Taliban?</strong> Millions of Afghans face starvation this winter after the withdrawal of foreign aid when the Islamist Taliban took power.

A no-strings, regular cash transfer to everyone could shake up the welfare system, bring new economic security and create more opportunities for all.</p> <p><strong>‘Hybrid is here to stay' </strong>It is almost two years since Covid-19 triggered a mass experiment in homeworking. Yet there is no consensus among economists on how the shift might affect developed economies, especially when it comes to productivity. Stanford professor Nick Bloom argues that the revolution could usher in an <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/c3ada896-c7df-46a0-bb23-10aa723fd1e9\">era of globalisation in services</a>.</p> <h1>Menswear</h1> <p>As Jedi knights and bullfighters will attest, when it comes to men's outerwear, nothing matches <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d0f7700-3310-4798-bdeb-7fbe34520c2e\">the cape</a> as a garment for pure theatre.
