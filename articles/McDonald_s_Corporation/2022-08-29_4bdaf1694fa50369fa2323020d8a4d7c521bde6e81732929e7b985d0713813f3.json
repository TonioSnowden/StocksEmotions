  "text": "<p>We're in for a “sustained period of below-trend growth,” according to Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell, as the central bank continues to hack away at persistent inflation. That was the dismal news from Jackson Hole on Friday, and it certainly didn't surprise me. How could anyone think that after 30 years of declining real interest rates and highly financialised “growth,” there wasn't going to be an inflationary price to pay?</p> <p>We all know the big picture story. But inflation isn't just about the usual numbers. I find that it's sneaking up all around us in unexpected places and ways. For example, consider how some companies are making products smaller rather than charging more for them. That pint of Häagen-Dazs ice cream? Look closely, and you'll see it's gone from 16oz to 14oz (I notice these things when I'm eating half the increasingly costly tub in front of the television). Companies from Pepsi to McDonald's to Domino's to P&amp;G and Target are keeping prices down by resorting to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/25/tiktok-creators-are-calling-out-businesses-on-shrinkflation-.html.\">“shrinkflation,”</a> cutting the size of your toilet paper, oatmeal bars, pizza and sodas. </p> <p>Services, too, are suffering from shrinkflation in standards. I first began noticing this in the past six months or so, as I have been doing more travel. Labour costs and shortages in travel and tourism mean more short-term contract workers and trainees. Perhaps that's why I was given someone else's boarding pass on one recent flight and managed to get through the gate with it. My winter ski holiday in Jackson Hole involved staying in a former Best Western that had been bought out by boutique hoteliers who slapped some paint on it and were charging quadruple the usual prices <strong>—</strong> even though most of the staff were clearly overseas college hires who had no resort experience. The window unit heating kept breaking down and room service was non-existent. Branding this place as a three-star joint would have been a stretch — four stars was a joke. The only resort lodging in town that seemed to have maintained normal service standards was the Four Seasons but, sadly, it was $2,000 a night.</p> <p>We've gotten used to doing more with less, and paying more for it, post-pandemic. This is part of why corporate profit margins are <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-25/us-corporate-profits-soar-taking-margins-to-widest-since-1950#xj4y7vzkg\">higher than they have been since 1950</a>. Companies are refusing to take the pain from inflation themselves and are passing it on to consumers. So, perhaps Joe Biden and antitrust reform advocates like the Federal Trade Commission's Lina Khan have a point about price gouging.</p> <p>But how is it that people can keep paying? Because the richest quintile of the population does roughly 60 per cent of the spending (a topic that I explore in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38b2097d-dc42-4058-958a-55b7fd2c2b91\">my column this week</a>). According to a recent American Enterprise Institute analysis, that group has enjoyed 80 per cent of the wealth effect from rising asset prices over the past few years (since they receive more of their compensation in stock, and have far bigger retirement funds and more home equity). This isn't something that is tallied in the official inflation data. And it's something that many conservative economic thinkers have told us we shouldn't worry about. Who cares about the asset wealth of the “haves and the have yachts,” to quote the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/07/25/the-haves-and-the-have-yachts\">wonderful Evan Osnos piece</a> that Ed flagged last week, when most Americans have no assets at all? The inflationary impact of low rates shouldn't hurt them, so what does it matter to someone living pay cheque to pay cheque whether Jeff Bezos is worth $500bn or several trillion?</p> <p>I think we are starting to have a new answer to that question. It's not just income inequality that matters, but asset inequality. Asset inflation resulting from three decades of hyper-financialised growth has created a large enough consuming class in America that the rich can keep spending in the face of more and more rate hikes. Cash buys for homes have become standard. Zip codes matter more to future employment outcomes than effort. Intergenerational wealth transfers are necessary for a decent education. This isn't a handful of oligarchs driving prices up. It's the rich in general. It's why sales of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6272214-0812-458a-98d2-c77e84ade187\">both La Mer face cream and Spam do quite well</a>, as my colleague Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson has pointed out. It's also why Biden's well-intentioned student loan relief&#xa0;programme won't solve the underlying problem of a college education in the US (at a four-year private school, anyway) costing double the median salary.</p> <p>Ed, have you noticed sneaky inflation in your own life? And are you changing any particular habits to deal with it?</p> <h1>Recommended Reading</h1> <ul>  <li><p>This piece by New York Times columnist Ezra Klein, revisiting the old Marshall McLuhan truism about how “the medium is the message” is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/07/opinion/media-message-twitter-instagram.html\">the smartest and truest thing I've read</a> about our digital age.</p></li>  <li><p>Yet another <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/censorship-at-a-top-college-for-free-speech-claremont-mckenna-socrates-huck-funn-literature-fire-frederick-douglass-11661198952\">op-ed from an academic</a>, this time at Claremont-McKenna, who has been muzzled by cancel culture. The professor apparently quoted Huck Finn, which of course uses the N-word, in explaining to a foreign student why censorship might happen. The student (understandably) didn't comprehend the American politics of it all. This sort of thing is just absurd and academic leaders need to get real about what is offensive, and what is simply teaching.</p></li>  <li><p>An <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/that-fancy-university-course-it-might-actually-come-from-an-education-company-11657126489\">excellent WSJ investigatio</a>n into the increasing blurred lines between for-profit and non-profit education.</p></li>  <li><p>This NYT <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/14/business/worker-productivity-tracking.html\">analysis of worker productivity scores</a> (hospice chaplains who can't take time to help the bereaved; nurses who do more paperwork than care) makes me wonder when the revolt against the machines will happen . . . </p></li>  <li><p>In the FT, my colleagues Kiran Stacey and Caitlin Gilbert have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/122e8ec2-7c71-41a4-9e19-8b7070aa54ed\">a very sharp look at how and why Biden is back</a>. I particularly love that he's come out swinging against Trumpian fascism. </p></li>  <li><p>And <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9113f75d-169d-4735-912a-6a124e5c30ff\">don't miss this Stephen Bush essay</a> on why filmmakers just can't stop adapting Tolkien. I've always been a fan but having now watched the first episode of the disappointing Game of Thrones prequel <em>House of Dragons</em>, I'm going back to the Old Master for my fantasy jones.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Edward Luce responds </h1> <p>Rana, I'm neither a Spam eater nor a La Mer&#xa0;consumer so I read Andrew's instructive piece with academic interest (Spam gives me PTSD about the prison food I was served at boarding school in England, and my skin is so perfect I don't need face cream. OK, the last bit I made up). But your observation makes total sense. Asset price inequality is far worse than income inequality. As you point out, the majority&#xa0;of Americans have virtually no assets. According&#xa0;to the Federal Reserve's <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/scf20.pdf\">last survey of consumer&#xa0;finances</a> the median American family's net worth is $121,700. The average is $748,800. The gap between the two is a measure of inequality. It should be no surprise we live in the age of teeming Dollar Stores and the mega-yacht.</p> <p>My own experience with inflation is more typically upper-quintile — chiefly in the soaring cost of international&#xa0;flights and encountering the declining level of service at airports. Also, Uber prices have gone from guilt-makingly low to outrageous in some recent experiences. But that might be more because of Uber starting to cash in on the loss-leading semi-monopoly it has built than the (until recently) rising price of petrol. As for the latter, I can never get worked up about US gas-pump prices exceeding $5 since that's still absurdly cheap by the standards of the rest of the developed world. Though I understand the travails of America's “car poor”, I would rather live in a world where US petrol prices never fall below $8 — as is the case in most of Europe — so that America's commuters are priced into forms of travel that don't hasten global warming. I appreciate this might not be a politically savvy point of view. </p> <p>What interests me most, however, is the level of middle finger inequality in which our super-rich are indulging. Society eventually deals with acute inequality via war or revolution. Let us hope democracy can surprise&#xa0;us on the upside. </p> <h1>Your feedback </h1> <p><strong>And now a word from our Swampians . . . </strong></p> <p><strong>In response to </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f58bb532-18d0-443d-b608-f28288443702\"><strong>‘“Stalemate” is far too generous to Putin'</strong></a><strong>: <br></strong>“I agree with your analysis of Putin's vulnerability but think you are underestimating Europe's vulnerability. It is not about this winter, it is about whether there will be a viable European economy operating come the spring. German industry is in dire straits. Consumers have no capacity to withstand the massive increase in energy pricing. The desperation of European leaders is evident in Chancellor Scholz' trip to Canada. All the discussions that took place are Alice in Wonderland material. No basis in technological or financial reality. Hope I am wrong.” <em>— Wolf Raymer, Toronto, Canada</em></p><p>Source: Rana Foroohar 2022 'Sneaky inflation' FT.com 29 August.
