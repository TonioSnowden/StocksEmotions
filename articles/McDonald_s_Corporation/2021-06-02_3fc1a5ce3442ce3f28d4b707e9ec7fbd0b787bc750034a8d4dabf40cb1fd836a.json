  "text": "<p>With Animal Rebellion protesters shutting down McDonald's UK distribution centres and talk of trade deals with the US and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c5f7a0c-6be8-42be-b2de-fe721dc08701\">Australia</a> and their knock-on effects on food and welfare standards, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/henry-mance\">Henry Mance</a>'s heartfelt exploration of our treatment (and mistreatment) of animals could hardly be more topical. </p> <p>Mance, the Financial Times' chief features writer, is vegan and would very much like you to be, too. His argument as to why lies at the centre of <em>How to Love Animals. </em>Challenging, but also funny and refreshingly low in sanctimony, this book is no frothing polemic. It will doubtless alter many readers' understanding of the systems we all participate in and lead them to make different choices. For others, it should prompt the difficult moral reasoning that those of us who love animals but also profit from their suffering cravenly manage to avoid. </p> <p>In order to investigate our exploitation of animals, Mance gets his hands dirty, often literally. He works briefly in an abattoir and at a pig farm; he goes fishing, hunting and on an Animal Rebellion protest; visits a research lab, the EU's biggest fresh fish market in Vigo, and the Corgi Con canine beach party in San Francisco; and talks to scientists, rewilders, biologists, a vegan chef, farmers, billionaire philanthropists and conservationists. </p> <p>There are some oversimplifications, including claims that “giving up meat saves farm animals from suffering and creates space for wild animals” or that “if we move away from meat eating, wolves will kill deer — not sheep or cows”. These are balanced by examples of how complicated things can be. For example, it was Colombia's drug wars, not conservation efforts, that protected its rainforest, and that calls for human population control shade all too easily into eco-fascism. </p> <p>Throughout, Mance is an amiable guide: curious and open-minded enough to alter his position when the facts seem to demand it, deciding that farmed mussels, clams and oysters can be eaten in good conscience, arguing for deer to be culled, and coming down — with caveats — on the side of trophy hunting, where it benefits conservation and local communities. And he is not blind to the contradictions in his own life. His much-loved cat hunts and kills wild birds; he adopts a chicken only to fail to get it into its coop, leading to its demise at the jaws of a fox (rural folk will raise an eyebrow at him paying a vet £15 to cremate the unfortunate hen); and it's likely that his cruelty-free, vegan leather shoes will never biodegrade. </p> <p>The point is that while we can all do better, we will always to some degree be hypocrites. The complex systems that we are born into make sure of that.</p> <p>Mance has done a great deal of research to lay out his moral case for change, so it is curious that so much of it — from statistics and case studies to the use of antibiotics in farming and the gap between people's expressed preferences and their purchases — is specific to America. For British readers it can leave a persuasion gap. </p> <p>The author makes a strong ethical case for giving up meat and dairy if you live in America, and that extends to the proposed import of many US animal products. We should also look hard at other countries' <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d3c2e24-a2fd-4bac-9baf-b657facd6560\">welfare standards</a>, including Australia, New Zealand and some EU countries. But anyone willing to reduce their intake of animal products while shopping carefully, locally and paying more may find themselves unpersuaded that veganism is morally necessary in the UK. </p> <p>And even if it were, would it be possible? Climate and geography mean that most UK agricultural land is best suited to grass production, not crops. Humans can't digest grass, and we couldn't grow many of the staples of a vegan diet even on our prime arable land. To feed a vegan population, we would have to vastly increase our imports (and food miles) and get rid of any notion of national food security. Alternatively, we can convert that grass to something we can eat. </p> <p>For now, the best means to do that is livestock. But that's not to let us off the moral hook. Even our very best large-scale meat, egg and dairy operations treat sentient creatures as units of production and fail to allow for their flourishing — and that, to Mance, is wrong. “If I could sum up my desired relationship with animals in one sentence, it would be: deliberate domestication is a dead end, wildness is the path that takes us where we need to go,” Mance writes in his concluding chapter. </p> <p>Could humans have survived on Earth had we not brought animals under our control for our own ends? Who can say? Whether we can and should extricate ourselves from our dependence on them now is Mance's question, and while answers may vary, confronting our cognitive dissonance is surely the very least we owe our fellow creatures whose lives we control.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/178733208X/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=178733208X&amp;linkId=878faca447d581ee6475a84c790b2e4d\"><strong>How to Love Animals</strong></a><strong> in a Human-Shaped World</strong> by Henry Mance, <em>Jonathan Cape, RRP£20, 400 pages</em> </p> <p><em>Melissa Harrison is author of ‘</em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0571363512/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0571363512&amp;linkId=4816d1d703a0571c28617188741c0c93\"><em>The Stubborn Light of Things</em></a><em>: A Nature Diary'</em></p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: Melissa Harrison 2021 'How to Love Animals by Henry Mance — creatures' comfort' FT.com 2 June.
