  "text": "<p>Russian attacks on population centers and efforts to encircle Kyiv have driven more than three million people out of Ukraine since the invasion began on Feb. 24. Russia has failed to take control of any major Ukrainian city. In the international effort to stop Mr. Putin, the U.S. and its European allies have looked to inflict economic pain on the Russian leader with sanctions and mounting efforts to cut off Moscow's energy exports. The Russian leader has shown no indication he would bow to pressure to end the war. Daily teleconferences are under way between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators, after a meeting of foreign ministers from both sides proved fruitless. </p><p>A soldier rested in Ukraine as smoke billowed on the horizon.

He called it \"de-Nazification,\" falsely claiming that Kyiv is controlled by a cabal of American-sponsored neo-Nazis.</p><p>More significantly, Mr. Putin regards Ukraine and Russia as inseparable, \"one people, a single whole,\" and aims to intercept Kyiv's closer integration with the West and especially its aspiration to join NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Ukraine was part of the Soviet Union before its collapse at the end of the Cold War in 1991, after which Russia lost much of its economic power and prestige. At the least, he intends to compel Ukraine to recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, and two breakaway regions in Donetsk and Luhansk. He also aims to secure Ukraine's commitment to maintain strict neutrality.</p><p>Mr. Putin has already expanded Moscow's influence over former Soviet republics such as Belarus, Georgia and Moldova, but Ukraine has long been the primary prize, sitting on Russia's western flank, where, historically, it has been most vulnerable to attack.</p><p>The trend among Ukrainians to support closer integration with Europe and the growing use of the Ukrainian language instead of Russian has alarmed the Kremlin, however. And since the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has become a high-profile champion of Ukrainian sovereignty, with his displays of defiance from Kyiv and steady lobbying of NATO and the international community to help his country stop Mr. Putin. </p><p>A woman wept during the evacuation of Irpin, Ukraine.

Ukrainian forces also said they pressed an offensive south and east of the southern port of Mykolayiv. Russian forces have faced heavy resistance from Ukrainian troops and volunteers, and have turned to shelling residential areas in an apparent effort to cow the country's defenses.</p><p>The second-largest city, Kharkiv, has been badly hit though it is still held by Ukraine. The southern city of Kherson is under Russian control, the first regional capital to be occupied, but Ukraine said it carried out an airstrike on the city's airport, which is now a Russian air base, and satellite imagery showed destroyed or damaged Russian helicopters.</p><p>Security concerns over the safety of Ukraine's nuclear plants, including the one at Chernobyl, which is now under Russian control and operated by a skeleton crew of captive Ukrainians, are a persistent theme in the war, given the indiscriminate nature of the Russian bombardments.</p><p>In the besieged southern city of Mariupol, where a Russian airstrike hit a maternity hospital last week, residents have faced renewed attacks while struggling without power, cellphone coverage or water supplies. Mr. Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, has petitioned the West for military aid and repeatedly lashed out at NATO's refusal to implement a no-fly zone over his country to prevent Russian bombardments of civilian areas. Mr. Putin has warned that any action against Russian combat aircraft over Ukraine from the soil of another country would be met with an immediate military response.</p><p>Four Russian brigadier generals have been killed in Ukraine since the invasion began, Kyiv officials said, a sign of vulnerabilities in Moscow's military tactics.</p><p>A Russian airstrike hit a military training center near the border with Poland early Sunday, one day after Moscow warned the West that it would consider arms deliveries to Ukraine as legitimate targets. Eight missiles hit the military training center at Yavoriv, a base where, until last month, the U.S. National Guard trained Ukrainian troops. The strike killed 35 people and injured 134, and destroyed and damaged some barracks, according to the governor's office in Lviv.</p><p>How are the people of Ukraine handling the crisis?</p><p>The Russian invasion has driven many Ukrainians to flee the country or to find shelter wherever possible, and others to join the fight.</p><p>Moscow, facing strong Ukrainian resistance, pivoted quickly to indiscriminate strikes in what has been an unsuccessful effort to bludgeon the Ukrainian government into submission. Thousands of civilians have been killed, according to Ukrainian officials. In besieged cities such as Mariupol and Chernihiv, so many civilians have died that officials are struggling to recover bodies and count the dead. In Kharkiv, which before the invasion was a city of 1.4 million, residents have moved into the subway as Russian attacks pulverize the city.</p><p>The streets of Kyiv are now mostly empty of residents, with just soldiers and some elderly left behind as Russian forces try to encircle the city. In many cities, those who have remained spend nights in air-raid shelters or preparing to repel the Russian advance. Protests against Russian occupation have emerged in southern cities that have fallen under the control of Russian forces.</p><p>More than three million people have fled Ukraine—with 1.5 million children among them—and more than two million are internally displaced, according to the United Nations. More than 200,000 Ukrainians have returned home to help defend the country, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has said.</p><p>What are NATO and the West doing in response to Russia?</p><p>NATO allies are bolstering the alliance's eastern flank, which borders Ukraine, deploying jet fighters and ships to the region. President Biden was expected to announce a total of more than $1 billion in new military assistance to Ukraine as early as Wednesday, according to U.S. officials. The European Union has set out plans for loans and grants to Ukraine valued at more than $1.3 billion. NATO isn't, however, planning to enforce a no-fly zone to limit Russian aerial threats, despite pleas from Ukraine.</p><p>The West's primary weapon is to cut Russia off from global financial markets and damage its economy. The U.S. is also banning imports of Russian oil, the lifeblood of Moscow's economy, as well as Russian natural gas and other energy sources, President Biden said on March 8 at the White House. The EU plans to cut its imports of Russian natural gasby two-thirds by the end of this year, and the U.K. said it would phase out the Russian oil imports. Germany earlier halted the Nord Stream 2 natural-gas pipeline. </p><p>Refugees lined up in Lviv, Ukraine, as they waited for a train or bus that would take them to the border as they seek to leave the country.

As the measures came into force, long lines of Russians appeared at banks in Moscow and other cities hoping to withdraw dollars. The governor of the central bank, Elvira Nabiullina, appeared on state television, dressed all in black, to declare that Russia's financial system and economy \"are facing a totally abnormal situation\" as policy makers doubled interest rates to 20%.</p><p>The Russian ruble lost more than one-fifth of its value against the dollar on the first day, and economists expect the economy to incur a sizable contraction this year along with double-digit inflation. Russia's stock market will remain closed for a third week as Moscow grapples with the fallout from the sanctions.</p><p>Middle-class Russians who had grown used to foreign vacations and access to Western consumer goods are now facing up to the prospect of spending long winters at home without any McDonald's burgers, Starbucks coffee or services such as Netflix and Spotify as Western brands pull out of the country. The development of energy resources is also under threat as companies such as BP and Shell said they would step back from doing business with Russia.</p><p>Moscow's streets have been crawling with armed security forces to stop protests against the war. Nearly 15,000 Russians have been detained in antiwar rallies, according to OVD-Info, and a highly visible display of dissent came from a state television producer, who ran onto the set of an evening news program with an antiwar poster. </p><p>Civilians pulled luggage through the snow as they left Irpin, Ukraine. PHOTO: Manu Brabo for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Is there a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine?</p><p>Russian and Ukrainian negotiators began a series of videoconferences on Monday. Ukraine representative Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, has said the focus would be on achieving a cease-fire, the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops and security guarantees for Ukraine. Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky, who is leading the Russian delegation, said the negotiations would continue \"every day, seven days a week,\" via videoconference.</p><p>A 90-minute meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, in Turkey on March 10 ended with no sign of progress.</p><p>Is Putin planning to use nuclear weapons?</p><p>Mr. Putin on Feb. 27 raised the alert level of Russia's nuclear forces, though not to the highest level. It appears to be the first time that Mr. Putin has publicly announced a state of combat readiness for Russia's nuclear weapons.</p><p>Russia has more than 1,500 warheads deployed and almost 3,000 in reserve, according to an assessment published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.</p><p>Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said Mr. Putin's announcement meant that Russia's nuclear forces were now ready to launch, shortening reaction times, but it could also be a display of brinkmanship.</p><p>Write to James Hookway at James.Hookway@wsj.com and Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com</p><p>Why Is Russia Invading Ukraine and What Does Putin Want?</p>",
