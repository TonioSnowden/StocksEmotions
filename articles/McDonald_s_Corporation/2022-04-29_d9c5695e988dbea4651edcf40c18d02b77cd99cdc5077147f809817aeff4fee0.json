  "title": "Business News: McDonald's Price Increases Help Boost Sales in the U.S.",
  "text": "<p>Restaurants and food companies are trying to balance raising prices to offset more expensive ingredients and wages against consumers' ability and willingness to pay higher prices.</p><p>McDonald's Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said the company is focused on remaining a good value for diners, particularly for low-income customers who are more likely to notice inflation. \"We've always got to stay competitive on value,\" Mr. Kempczinski said.</p><p>Consumers so far haven't resisted McDonald's menu price increases, executives said, but some diners are trading down to cheaper options, or ordering less food per visit. U.S. guest counts dropped roughly 1% in the quarter compared with a year ago, and store hours remain down slightly from prepandemic levels.</p><p>Higher menu prices helped lift McDonald's total sales to $5.67 billion for the quarter, outpacing expectations of analysts surveyed by FactSet. McDonald's shares rose 2.9% to $254.19 on Thursday.</p><p>McDonald's reported quarterly earnings of $2.28 a share, after adjusting for the closure of its Russian market and the potential settlement of an international tax matter, exceeding analysts' expectations of $2.17 a share.</p><p>Drive-through and online sales are helping the company's business, and the chain said McDonald's is now the largest fast-food-delivery service in the world.</p><p>The company said Thursday it expects food and other costs to rise 12% to 14% this year on an annual rate. Labor costs in the U.S. are up 10% from last year, reflecting the company's move to increase wages in its own restaurants, it said.</p><p>McDonald's said its same-store sales globally grew 11.8% during the quarter, compared with a year ago. The Chicago-based burger chain reported net income of $1.1 billion for the quarter, down 28% from last year's period. The company said it incurred $127 million in costs in its first quarter related to the closure of its Russian market.</p>",
