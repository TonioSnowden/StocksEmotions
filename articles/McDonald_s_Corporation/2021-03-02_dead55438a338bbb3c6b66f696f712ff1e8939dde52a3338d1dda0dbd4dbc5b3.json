  "text": "<p>One of Marcia Fudge's first big battles as an elected official was over a shopping centre in Warrensville Heights, Ohio.<br><br>A developer wanted to build a hub for major retailers in the largely black Cleveland suburb, which has a population of 13,000. But Fudge would not have it. Warrensville Heights did not want “giant retail stores”, but office space and hotels, she said.<br><br>“We also control our own destiny and our own vision for the future,” Fudge, who was mayor of Warrensville Heights between 2000 and 2008, said at the time. “The days of plantation rule are over.”<br><br>Fudge won that battle and many others like it, and is widely credited for revitalising the area during her eight years as mayor.<br><br>Now she is being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19f191a8-5ba8-4408-b401-78fa15f99499\">counted on</a> by progressives to do the same in urban areas across the US as President Biden's nominee to lead the department of housing and urban development (HUD). The $50bn agency manages 1m units of public housing and oversees a vast array of federally-funded housing programmes — from insuring mortgage loans to voucher programmes for low-income families.<br></p> <p>Housing reform is expected to be a key part of Biden's efforts to support the black voters who propelled him into office, many of whom still deal with the consequences of decades of segregation and discrimination in America's housing market.<br><br>Malcom Glenn, a fellow at the New America think-tank, called Fudge's appointment to HUD “a real opportunity” to make tangible progress on an issue where race and economics are tightly bound.<br><br>“If this administration and Secretary Fudge make racial equity, not just a core, but sort of the singular core guiding force around everything that they do, I think we'll be in a much much much better place than we've ever been,” Glenn says. “I don't think any HUD secretary has ever done that.”<br>&#xa0;<br>Ro Khanna, a Democratic representative from California, believes Fudge is uniquely qualified for the job. “She understands deeply housing inequity, she understands racial exclusion,” Khanna said. “[She will] really focus on equity in housing and anti-racist zoning laws and anti-racist policies.”<br>&#xa0;<br>But to deliver on those hopes, Fudge will have to grapple with a demoralised agency facing dual crises. An unprecedented number of Americans face the threat of eviction because of the Covid crisis. And inside HUD, a mass exodus of career staffers under previous secretary Ben Carson has decimated the ranks. </p> <p>Congress slashed the department's operating budget by 15 per cent last year.<br><br>Carson, a black surgeon who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67258424-6920-11e5-97d0-1456a776a4f5\">grew up</a> in public housing, did not believe that it was the government's responsibility to rectify the effects of systemic racism on the American housing market.<br><br>HUD also has a long record of underdelivering, and has sometimes been regarded as a backwater of government. Rates of home ownership among blacks have been largely stagnant since the 1968 Fair Housing Act outlawed discriminatory policies that, among other ills, made it exceedingly difficult for blacks to take out mortgages.<br>&#xa0;<br>Even Fudge acknowledged its shortcomings soon after her nomination. “I don't know that anybody can even tell you what HUD has done,” she said. “So I really do think that HUD has not fulfilled its mission.”<br><br>Fudge, 68, has lived in the same tightly-knit neighbourhood for decades. Her personal phone number is listed in the local phone book, and she drives her 89-year-old mother to church every Sunday morning, stopping first at McDonald's for a cup of coffee.<br>&#xa0;<br>Her success in Warrensville Heights elevated her to Congress before the end of her second mayoral term. But her ascent was also tinged with tragedy: she was elected to fill the seat of her close friend and former boss, Congresswoman Stephanie Tubbs Jones when she died suddenly in August 2008.<br><br>“She's tough as nails and I have to caution her sometimes about being too tough,” said Jim Clyburn, the House majority whip, adding that Fudge is the first person that fellow members of the Congressional Black Caucus members confide in during a crisis.<br><br>During her time in Congress, she worked closely with the department of agriculture, an agency not often thought to be at the forefront of the fight for racial justice. But Fudge prodded it to expand food voucher programmes, development schemes in rural areas, and for clearer labelling on food products.<br>&#xa0;<br>She was actually angling for the top agriculture job when Biden tapped her for HUD instead. Last year, she told Politico in November: “You know, it's always ‘we want to put the black person in [the department of] labor or HUD.'”<br><br>At HUD, Fudge has proposed boosting spending on housing, establishing programs to help Americans save up for mortgage down payments, and transforming a voucher program for low-income renters from a lottery to a guarantee for everyone that meets the requirements.<br>&#xa0;<br>“Her style is not combative. She prefers to get along, but she's not a pushover,” said Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson, who worked closely with Fudge during her mayoral tenure. “That means just don't piss her off.”<br></p> <p>In response to a question at her confirmation hearing from Republican Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton on what he called a “long history of intemperate comments”, Fudge replied: “Sometimes I am a little passionate about things.”<br><br>She is almost certain to meet further opposition. During the confirmation hearing, Pennsylvania's Republican senator Patrick Toomey complained that Obama-era fair housing policies were too costly and time consuming for home builders — and Fudge wants to go much farther than the Obama administration did.<br><br>People who know Fudge do not expect her to back down. “I think President Biden and his team want to have a slugger in that position,” said Tami Jackson Buckner, a&#xa0;partner Michael Best Strategies and sorority sister of Fudge's. “She is someone who knows that without a home, it's hard to fulfil your American dream.”</p> <p><em>This article has been amended to correct the spelling of Malcom Glenn's name</em></p><p>Source: Taylor Nicole Rogers in Chattanooga 2021 'Can the lumbering US housing department become a force for change?'
