  "text": "<p>Wendy's, the US burger chain, has announced that it plans to open 700 “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a66619b0-77e4-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab\">dark kitchens</a>” as it boosts its footprint across the US, UK and Canada on the back of record profits.</p> <p>The fast-food group said on Wednesday that it aimed to have between 8,500 and 9,000 restaurants worldwide by 2025, pushing its number of new openings to 2,200 in the next four years. This includes at least 700 sites through a franchise agreement with SoftBank-backed Reef Technology, which operates delivery-only, or “dark”, kitchens on parking lots.</p> <p>“Our robust growth continued in the second quarter, as sales significantly exceeded our expectations, leading to restaurant-level margins of more than 20 per cent and record profits, fuelling our restaurant economic model,” said chief executive Todd Penegor.&#xa0;</p> <p>Wendy's bet on the resilience of the food delivery market comes as easing pandemic restrictions and restaurants reopening threaten to slow the sector's growth.</p> <p>The company said that the agreement with US-based Reef followed the successful test of eight dark kitchens in Canada. It expects Reef to open 50 sites for the brand this year. </p> <p>Reef, which has expanded beyond its core business of managing parking lots, works with restaurant brands to offer food delivery in new neighbourhoods or cities, beyond their traditional locations. </p> <p>Its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8cbeef94-bfc7-40eb-991a-bc519c058f73\">dark kitchens</a> offer a way for restaurants to increase their reach on food delivery apps such as DoorDash or Uber Eats without the extra cost of renting and fitting out premises. </p> <p>“We are creatures of habit and we like convenience and I think that will be at the heart of what people are looking for,” said Abigail Pringle, Wendy's chief development officer. “Delivery is here to stay and what better way to capture that than through a delivery kitchen.”</p> <p>The dark kitchens will be a cornerstone of Wendy's plans to expand in the UK, where it relaunched this year. It said that it aimed to open between five and 10 in the UK before the end of the year, focusing on central London.</p> <p>Wendy's first entered the UK in the 1980s, taking prominent sites in London's West End but withdrew in 2001, citing high property costs and a need to focus on its core US market.</p> <p>On opening a restaurant in Reading in June, it said was targeting up to 400 UK sites and eventually planned to launch in continental Europe. The group has roughly 6,830 restaurants worldwide.</p> <p>Pringle said that the proportion of the 700 dark kitchens in the UK would be “meaningful” and that its partnership with Reef would be its only delivery-focused franchise agreement. It is exploring franchise arrangements for restaurant sites with 30 other candidates.</p> <p>Rival McDonald's dominates the UK fast-food sector with roughly 1,300 restaurants, while Burger King has more than 500. </p> <p>Wendy's upgraded its annual sales forecast on Wednesday, from a growth rate of 8-10 per cent to 11-13 per cent. Revenues for the three months to July 4 were $493m, up 7 per cent compared with the first quarter. Net income increased 58 per cent to $65.7m.</p> <p>The company's shares were up as much as 4 per cent in morning trade in New York.</p><p>Source: Alice Hancock in London 2021 'Burger chain Wendy's to expand into ‘dark kitchens' after raising forecasts ' FT.com 11 August.
