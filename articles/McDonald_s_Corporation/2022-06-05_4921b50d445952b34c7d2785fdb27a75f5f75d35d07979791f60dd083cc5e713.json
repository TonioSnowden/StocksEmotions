  "title": "U.S. Urged to Step Up in Pacific After China Visit; 'It's Not Only About Having McDonald's in Fiji'; Fijians warn the U.S. is at risk of losing influence as Beijing seeks closer ties in the region",
  "text": "<p>\"They can do a lot more in Fiji,\" said Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Fiji's attorney general, from his office overlooking a stretch of tropical ocean. \"It's not only about having McDonald's in Fiji.\"</p><p>The Pacific, with its key shipping lanes, fisheries and strategic position, has emerged as a hot spot in the great power rivalry between the U.S. and China. And nowhere has diplomacy been as intense as in Fiji, a nation of nearly a million people and whose capital, Suva, has been called the New York of the Pacific.</p><p>The visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who fist-bumped Fijian officials as he strode down a red carpet at an airport near Suva, capped a flurry of recent diplomatic activity. In February, Fiji hosted U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the first visit by a sitting secretary of state in nearly 40 years. Kurt Campbell, the National Security Council's coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, visited in April, and days before Mr. Wang's visit, Australia's new foreign minister, Penny Wong, arrived.</p><p>The jet-setting shows that the U.S. and its allies know they need to strengthen their relationships with Pacific countries, whose friendships have been based on a shared but increasingly distant history of fighting together in World War II.</p><p>\"I will acknowledge, for the U.S. to increase its game, we need to do a better job at increasing our bilateral engagement,\" said Tony Greubel, the chargé d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Fiji and currently the top diplomat in the country.</p><p>What's not clear is if those efforts can blunt China's campaign for closer ties in the region, which is raising concerns that Beijing could eventually establish a military presence in strategically important islands near U.S. territory. China denies it intends to set up a military base.</p><p>\"We see China everywhere,\" said Netani Rika, a former editor of the Fiji Times, one of the country's main media outlets, pointing out that an unfinished, Chinese-financed skyscraper in Suva is hard to miss. \"That is a symbol of China's visibility.\"</p><p>Chinese officials have said their overtures aren't a threat to any nation and are aimed at helping fellow developing countries grow their economies.</p><p>The U.S. was involved with building infrastructure during the war, and many Pacific airports began as airstrips for military use. China, however, has pushed hard in recent decades to enhance its standing, filling a gap in infrastructure financing and deepening relationships with Pacific leaders, some political observers say.</p><p>Washington has always been committed to the Pacific, according to U.S. officials, though it has become more of a focus recently. In February, Mr. Blinken released an Indo-Pacific strategy that called for more diplomatic and security resources to be allocated to the Pacific. The Biden administration has also built alliances to counter China's influence, including an economic platform called the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. In one diplomatic victory for the U.S., Fiji was the first Pacific island nation to join the group.</p><p>Mr. Greubel said the U.S. will be adding staff at the embassy—which currently serves five countries, including Fiji—and is looking at opening embassies in some countries where it currently doesn't have a diplomatic presence. He said more staff will be arriving for the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, which will intensify work to help Pacific countries deal with climate change and could expand to areas such as economic development, education and healthcare.</p><p>Mr. Greubel said the U.S. already contributes to multilateral institutions that provide aid and financing to Pacific nations, offers equipment and training opportunities to Fiji's military, which is active in United Nations peacekeeping missions, supports people-to-people exchanges, and helped to provide vaccines and other public-health support during the pandemic. Looking ahead, he said, Washington could provide more opportunities for people in the Pacific to study or train in the U.S.</p><p>\"We have a brand,\" said Mr. Greubel, noting that many of Fiji's tourist hotels are American chains and that the U.S. is Fiji's biggest export market. \"We have a lot of soft power.\"</p><p>Mr. Greubel couldn't say when embassies might open in other Pacific countries. One will be in the Solomon Islands, which recently signed a security pact with China. Mr. Greubel said that embassy could open later this year or next year.</p><p>One problem with the U.S. strategy of offering financing through multilateral forums is that when a project gets funding, it's unclear that it's U.S. money, say people involved with international development in the region.</p><p>U.S. standing was also hurt when the Trump administration quit the Paris climate accord, making it appear the U.S. wasn't serious about climate change, which many in the Pacific consider an existential threat, the people said. The fact that Fiji hasn't had a U.S. ambassador for more than a year doesn't help. At the end of May, the Biden administration put forward a nominee who is in the process of being confirmed.</p><p>Although Mr. Wang, China's foreign minister, didn't secure a wide-ranging regional agreement at a summit with Pacific leaders in Fiji, China still signed bilateral economic agreements with some nations during his recent tour of the region. That includes Kiribati, which in 2019 switched diplomatic ties to Beijing from Taipei and encompasses vast stretches of ocean and island chains, some of which are about 1,000 miles south of Hawaii.</p><p>Still, other countries remain wary. Ahead of Mr. Wang's tour, the president of the Federated States of Micronesia said activity by Chinese research vessels had followed his country's fiber-optic cables. He warned that China's push for a regional agreement covering areas including law enforcement and cybersecurity aimed to bring Pacific island nations more into Beijing's orbit.</p><p>In Fiji, where Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama faces an election within months, some of his rivals say they worry about China's influence. Sitiveni Rabuka, seen as Mr. Bainimarama's main opponent, said he would bring Fiji closer to its traditional Western allies.</p><p>China should \"treat us as a friendly small nation in the Pacific, rather than a foothold in the Pacific,\" Mr. Rabuka said.</p><p>Many people here remain partial to the U.S. Jay Colati, a bartender in Suva, said he favors the U.S. over China given Fiji's shared history with Western nations, and pointed out that many Fijian expats live in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand. But he said the U.S. should be more visible in the Pacific.</p><p>\"All we see is the Chinese flag all over,\" said Mr. Colati, 29 years old.</p><p>Mr. Sayed-Khaiyum, the government official, said Fiji is willing to engage with any country, with the most important points being respect for national sovereignty, addressing climate change and adherence to international law.</p><p>When asked to characterize the U.S.'s strategy versus China's, Mr. Sayed-Khaiyum was at a loss.</p><p>\"The Americans have not been very active, so it would be a bit difficult to compare,\" he said. \"The Chinese obviously have been a lot more active.\"</p><p>Write to Mike Cherney at mike.cherney@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Urged to Step Up in Pacific After China Visit; 'It's Not Only About Having McDonald's in Fiji'</p>",
