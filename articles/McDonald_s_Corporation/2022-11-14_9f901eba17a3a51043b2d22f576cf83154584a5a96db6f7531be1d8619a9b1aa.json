  "text": "<p>Pay for executive assistants varies by industry, too. Morgan Stanley is advertising an executive-assistant role that pays from $75,000 to $120,000. Hedge fund Two Sigma has a similar opening offering between $100,000 and $150,000. Queens College, part of the City University of New York, is looking for a confidential executive assistant, a role that pays around $70,000 to $79,000. Warner Bros. Discovery lists a role for talent executive assistant with a range of between about $60,000 and $111,000.</p><p>The listed ranges can help shed light on how companies make compensation decisions, a process that has long been a mystery to job seekers and employees.</p><p>\"It can help with future career progressions,\" said Karen Delgado, an account director for a New York-based marketing agency. Ms. Delgado accepted the job this fall and is relocating from California to New York City next month. \"Even to move internally within your organization, you can use the data in other job postings to negotiate a higher salary,\" the 30-year-old said.</p><p>Some employers are posting a single salary for certain roles. A general manager at a Panera restaurant in New York City lists a base salary of $83,500 rather than a range. At McDonald's a general manager can earn between $58,500 and $80,000 a year, while a Starbucks store manager will make between $64,400 and $97,200.</p><p>The owner of Ann Taylor is hiring for a marketing-operations manager for the retailer's Manhattan headquarters, with a salary range of $85,000 to $100,000. Uptown, Tiffany &amp; Co. is looking for a market-operations specialist who can expect to earn around $72,000 to $97,000.</p><p>Individuals should be cautious about drawing too many conclusions about salary ranges for jobs that look similar or even identical, said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at job site Indeed.</p><p>\"Those ranges refer to particular skills, what your experience looks like. Every input will move the range up or down,\" said Ms. Gudell. For an executive-level position, for example, a job managing global budgets would be worth more than one managing in-country budgets, she said.</p><p>The new law requires nearly all employers with staff in New York City to list pay on job postings, along with internal transfer or promotion opportunities. Companies hiring for remote positions that could conceivably be done from New York also must comply with the law and list minimum and maximum salary ranges, city officials have said.</p>",
