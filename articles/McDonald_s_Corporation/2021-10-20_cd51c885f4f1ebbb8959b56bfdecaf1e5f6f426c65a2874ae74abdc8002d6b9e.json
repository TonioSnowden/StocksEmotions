  "text": "<p>A few months ago, one of my daughters underwent a teenage rite of passage by getting her first paid summer job. Before the interview, she asked me for advice about what salary to request.</p> <p>“Fourteen dollars an hour,” I suggested, pointing out that while the going rate for the job as a shop assistant was about $12 in recent years in the New York region, she should pitch higher to create space for negotiation, and so learn some life skills.</p> <p>It didn't go quite how I'd anticipated: when she asked for $14, the shop offered her $15 because they were so short-staffed they feared she might hop to the competition. Cue one triumphantly smug teenager and an embarrassed mother.</p> <p>Was this just a fluke? It is a question with implications not just for teenagers, but the wider American economy. In recent decades, pay for workers at the low end of the US <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/8/16112368/piketty-saez-zucman-income-growth-inequality-stagnation-chart\">income scale has stagnated</a> in comparison with higher-paid workers and also when set against the proportion of national income that goes to “capital” or shareholders.</p> <p>Yet an entirely unexpected side effect of the Covid-19 shock is that this dynamic has shifted slightly. In September, average hourly pay in the US was <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/u-s-wages-are-soaring-but-high-inflation-is-not-leaving-workers-much-better-off-11633716685\">4.6 per cent higher</a> than a year before, one of the largest jumps seen for many years. And while this partly reflected fatter pay packages for top-rated workers, pay rates in many corners at the low end of the scale are rising too due to a perceived shortage of workers in some fields.</p> <p>Just this month, for example, Amazon is advertising for warehouse workers, offering a starting salary of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-amazon-hikes-starting-pay-18-an-hour-it-hires-125000-more-logistics-2021-09-14/\">$18 an hour</a>, up from $17 last year and $15 three years ago (and even less in other states). As some senior McDonald's executives recently told me, this creates the so-called Amazon effect, whereby its pay increases in one region force other enterprises, including McDonald's, to do the same to attract staff. The same is happening with other service sector employers, such as hotels.</p> <p>Is this a good thing? From a moral point of view, the answer is emphatically “yes”. Middle-class teenagers such as mine might not deserve wage increases for summer jobs. But millions of poor American households do, especially given the level of economic inequity that has plagued the country in recent years. And while a $2- or $3-an-hour increase for Amazon's warehouses will not dent these grotesque inequalities, it is at least a step in the right direction.</p> <p>From a wider economic point of view, however, the implications of the trend are more mixed. Some argue that what is happening right now is merely a one-off Covid-linked blip, or perhaps a shift sparked by strange supply-demand dynamics that will reset wages at a slightly higher rate, but then stop.</p> <p>After all, this argument goes, what is driving these wage hikes is the fact that the reopening of the American economy is so uneven that it is creating bottlenecks. But while this has pushed up goods prices and wages, the effects should disappear in time and thus be “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/296ae4e6-5e4e-44fc-8636-67e2ad38eee4\">transitory</a>”. This is the argument of the Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell, for one.</p> <p>This week a report from the San Francisco branch of the Fed advanced another idea: the financial aid given to poor workers during Covid-19 has also improved their household balances, which may have reduced their need to take unappealing, low-paid work. This is hotly debated but the impact of aid is striking. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4c61b0d-f006-4dc6-bf02-755706157857\">Brian Moynihan</a>, chief executive of Bank of America, tells me that his bank has seen a sevenfold increase in the current account balances of customers who normally have $2,000 or less in their accounts and a threefold increase among those with $5,000 or less. With aid now cut, it is easy to imagine those balances might fall again. &#xa0;</p> <p>The problem with the “transitory” arguments advanced by economists is that they ignore the slippery issue of consumer psychology. If you've never experienced a wage hike or rising consumer prices, it is easy to assume things won't change. And, if you're peering at supply-chain dynamics with a birds' eye view, you might recognise that price rises reflect idiosyncratic — temporary — shocks. </p> <p>But how will consumers feel if these “transitory” surprises keep occurring? Will people start to jump between jobs as employers raise hourly rates? Will they start to assume future wage and consumer price hikes? Will companies? “The real test will be if [this wage growth] gets into contracts,” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/523c210c-e064-43d8-a084-44d821e776b0\">Ray Dalio</a>, head of the Bridgewater hedge fund, recently told me. </p> <p>Of course, if this does materialise, some companies may respond by simply hiring fewer workers or automating more processes in a way that will reduce the bargaining power and wage growth of low-paid workers. Some are already doing this. But whether this will actually halt an upward inflationary spiral, if it emerges, is anyone's guess. As Dalio freely admitted, those pressures are building. The one thing that is clear is that my own daughter now assumes that this year's pay hike is here to stay. </p> <p><em>Follow Gillian on Twitter&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gilliantett\"><em>@gilliantett</em></a><em>&#xa0;and email her at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=gillian.tett@ft.com\"><em>gillian.tett@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTMag\"><em>@FTMag</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a80b0978-afe7-47a4-9bf6-c5aec4c2e5f5\"><em>Meeting the rent is tough on a New York City wage / From John Maltby, Canaan, NY, US</em></a></p><p>Source: Gillian Tett 2021 'Is my teenager's pay rise a sign of things to come?'
