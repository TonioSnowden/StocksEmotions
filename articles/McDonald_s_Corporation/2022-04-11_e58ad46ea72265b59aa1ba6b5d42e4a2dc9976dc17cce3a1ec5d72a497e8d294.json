  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis:  Brazil Enclave Welcomes Refugees  ----  By Samantha Pearson and Luciana Magalhaes",
  "text": "<p>   PRUDENTOPOLIS, Brazil -- Ever since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, this sleepy farming town some 7,000 miles away in southern Brazil has been gripped by a sense of both horror and nervous excitement. </p><p>   Nicknamed \"Little Ukraine,\" Prudentopolis prides itself on being one of the most Ukrainian towns in Latin America, perhaps even more Ukrainian than Ukraine itself, locals joke. </p><p>   Among soybean farms rise onion-domed wooden churches, where congregations in traditional embroidered shirts pray in a form of Ukrainian that resembles the dialect spoken by their ancestors, immigrants who arrived in Brazil as long ago as the 1890s. </p><p>   But things are about to change: The refugees are coming. Prudentopolis and surrounding towns are bracing to welcome up to hundreds of 21st-century Ukrainians in coming weeks as Russia's attack on Ukraine forces people to flee to distant corners of the globe. </p><p>   \"It pains my heart to see them suffering,\" said Eugenia Michalovski, 54, who looks after a Ukrainian cemetery in the town, dotted with pink flowers. \"They're our people.\" </p><p>   Like three-quarters of the town's 53,000 residents, Ms. Michalovski speaks Ukrainian. She also prays and sings in Ukrainian, listens to Ukrainian music, cooks Ukrainian food -- and has never set foot in Ukraine. </p><p>   Rafa Borges, a local evangelical pastor who helped organize the transfer of one of the first groups of refugees to the region recently, said he hopes the new arrivals will adapt more easily here and, in turn, strengthen the local Ukrainian community. </p><p>   \"Their arrival has brought enormous joy,\" said Mr. Borges, whose Comunidade Vida congregation, in the nearby town of Guarapuava, is part of a world-wide group of churches, the Global Kingdom Partnership Network. \"Many people's great-grandparents fled here during World War II and now they are doing the same thing to help the refugees.\" </p><p>   But an hour away at one of the church's community centers, where the first group of 28 refugees were recently completing a government-mandated Covid-19 quarantine, the Ukrainians appeared oblivious to the cultural significance of their arrival. They said they were just happy to be alive. </p><p>   Maryna Hashlova, 35, a teacher from eastern Ukraine, stopped to ponder whether she recognized anything from her native country while making the daylong bus trip south from Sao Paulo's airport. </p><p>   \"McDonald's! Yes, we have McDonald's in Ukraine too!\" </p><p>   As a gaggle of young boys crowded around an Xbox installed in the corner of the hall, their mothers tried to explain to the church leaders the items they needed. Many left their homes in a hurry during heavy bombing with nothing but the clothes they were wearing. </p><p>   The first night the group hardly slept. </p><p>   \"It turned out they thought there could be panthers and crocodiles outside,\" said one of the pastors. The leaders sat them down the next day to explain that the Amazon rainforest was very far away -- about 1,200 miles -- and stressed again that this region is known for being just like Ukraine. </p><p>   Most of the group -- 16 children, 10 women and two men -- had never thought about coming to Brazil before the war. \"Rio de Janeiro and Carnival\" is the extent of what she had heard about Latin America's biggest country, said Ms. Hashlova, who came with her son Nazar, 14, and daughter Arina, 8, a budding gymnast. Like most men, her husband was required to stay to help with the war effort. </p><p>   When Ms. Hashlova left her apartment in the northeastern city of Kharkiv at the end of February, she didn't intend to emigrate. But when the bombing got closer, the family grabbed a few belongings and headed to her parents' house in Kremenchuk -- normally a three-hour drive west but a trip that took 13 hours on jammed roads. </p><p>   After being awakened several times a night by the sound of air raid sirens that sent the family scurrying underground, Ms. Hashlova decided to head to Poland. It was there that her church told her the group Global Kingdom could pay their way to South America. </p><p>   \"The hardest thing was leaving my husband,\" said Ms. Hashlova. </p><p>   After hearing rumors that Mr. Putin's troops could even invade Warsaw, she said she felt safer in Brazil. It also helped convince her children that they were on some exotic adventure, rather than war refugees. </p><p>   \"We have a lot of affection for Europe here in this region,\" said Mr. Borges. </p><p></p>",
