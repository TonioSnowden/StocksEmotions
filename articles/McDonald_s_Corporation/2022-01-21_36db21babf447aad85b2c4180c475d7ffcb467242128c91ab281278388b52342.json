  "title": "McDonald's is expanding its test of the plant-based McPlant sandwich to 600 more locations",
  "text": "<p>Made with peas, rice and other plant-based ingredients, the sandwich will be available for a limited time and while supplies last.</p><p>“McDonald's USA is expanding the test to select restaurants in your area to help us&#xa0;understand&#xa0;customer demand,” the fast-food giant said in a statement.&#xa0;</p><p>The sandwich, co-developed with Beyond Meat Inc. BYND, was first launched in eight locations in 2021.</p><p>See: The bear-market selloff in Chipotle's stock has created an ‘attractive' buying opportunity, analyst says</p><p>Credit Suisse analysts highlighted the glut of plant-based menu items that restaurant chains have added and announced just a few weeks into the new year: Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc.'s CMGplant-based chorizo; Yum Brands Inc.'s YUMBeyond Fried Chicken at the KFC chain; and Starbucks Corp. SBUX bringing back Meatless Mondays through January.</p><p>“Restaurants tend to kick off the New Year with better-for-you platforms, and this year has started off with a spotlight on plant-based menu items,” Credit Suisse said.</p><p>McDonald's MCD is making the McPlant announcement a week ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings, which are scheduled to be released on January 27, according to a FactSet calendar.</p><p>Also: Chipotle is hot and Starbucks hits pause: Analysts say cost inflation will weigh on restaurants in 2022</p><p>“We believe McDonald's is well positioned to press its key competitive advantages (ie. execution, digital, asset base, marketing)  to maintain U.S. momentum, while upside potential still exists in key int'l markets through 2022,” UBS wrote in a note.</p><p>“[S]hares should continue to outperform in a choppy &amp; uncertain market given McDonald's provides inflation protection and defensive attributes. We believe McDonald's should remain a core long-term holding as a quality compounder set to further increase global market share &amp; accelerate free cash flow growth.”</p><p>UBS gave McDonald's stock a buy rating, with a $297 price target.</p><p>Beyond Meat had a long list of troubles that impacted its most recent earnings, but the partnership with McDonald's was a highlight, said BTIG analysts in November.</p><p>Want intel on all the news moving markets before the day starts?

We also outline the potential McPlant opportunity for Beyond Meat in the U.S. which we think could be worth ~$235 million in revenue over time, but likely only ~$30 million of gross profit.”</p><p>Beyond Meat is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings on March 3, according to the FactSet calendar.</p><p>McDonald's stock has gained 18.6% over the last year. Beyond Meat shares have been halved, down 54.4%, for the period. And the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA is up 11.4%.</p>",
