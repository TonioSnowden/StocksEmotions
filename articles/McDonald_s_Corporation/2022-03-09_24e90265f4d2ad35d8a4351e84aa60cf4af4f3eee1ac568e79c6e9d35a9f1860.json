  "text": "<p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21e27317-5151-43c8-b0be-40f37542698d\">prompted US companies across all sectors</a> to re-evaluate their businesses. Headlines suggest an exodus. The reality is more complicated. Instead of pulling out of the country, most multinationals are simply putting business there on hold. </p> <p>McDonald's, Levi's, PepsiCo and Starbucks are among the US companies temporarily suspending operations in Russia. The Golden Arches, which has 850 restaurants in the country, will continue to <a href=\"https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/press-releases.Russia-update.html\">pay employees there</a>. Pepsi will no longer sell sodas but will continue to <a href=\"https://www.pepsico.com/news/press-release/pepsico-suspends-production-and-sale-of-pepsi-cola-and-other-global-beverage-brands-in-russia\">sell “daily essentials”</a> like milk and baby food.</p> <p>Suspending or cutting back services makes business sense. US sanctions apply pretty well everywhere for multinationals. Russian sanctions will apply only in Russia. Cutting the country loose is an easy choice for western business.</p> <p>The collapse in the rouble and the shattering of supply chains mean it will become increasingly difficult to run Russian operations. </p> <p>Nike has suspended online sales in Russia because it cannot “currently guarantee delivery of goods to customers.” Canada Goose <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220302005810/en/Canada-Goose-Announces-Donation-to-United-Nations-Suspends-Sales-in-Russia\">blamed</a> “the challenged operating environment and evolving sanctions against Russian interests” in its decision to pause business. Ikea has temporarily closed its 17 stores in Russia, <a href=\"https://about.ikea.com/en/newsroom/2022/03/03/ikea-pauses-operations-in-russia-and-belarus\">citing</a> “serious disruptions to supply chain and trading conditions.”</p> <p>McDonald's has enough Russian exposure for it to matter. Nearly 10 per cent of its revenue comes from Russia. Halting operations is less onerous if the financial hit to the broader business is modest. Card payment network operators Mastercard and Visa each derive around 4 per cent of their revenue from the country. For Yum Brands and Levi's, Russia accounted for just 2 per cent of group revenue last year.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine these companies taking a similar stance against more important markets such as China. </p> <p>Even companies that are looking to completely pull out of Russia will find it difficult to do so. Moscow has imposed a temporary ban on foreign investors selling Russian assets. Leaving Russia will be easier said than done. </p><p>Source:  2022 'Russia/US brands: cutting business ties is easier said than done' FT.com 9 March.
