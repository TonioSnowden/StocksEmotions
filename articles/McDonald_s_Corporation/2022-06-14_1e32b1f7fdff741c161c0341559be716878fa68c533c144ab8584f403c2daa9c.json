  "text": "<p>Initially, I was excited. I was a good student and had avoided the whack of their ruler. But as soon as I heard that the position involved singing in front of the entire school, I froze. I wasn't ready for that kind of exposure and was terrified. My aspirations to be a rock star were all still in my imagination.</p><p>In Alhambra, Calif., my family first lived in a white stucco two-bedroom house with a gable roof. When I was 7, we moved to a brown ranch that wasn't much bigger in another part of town.</p><p>Early on, my father, Robert, was a salesman for Sarah Coventry, a maker of costume jewelry. The company had relocated us from Seattle to Southern California with hopes of expanding there.</p><p>But the Los Angeles suburbs were too spread out to produce the sales they wanted. After the company let him go, my father began to suffer from anxiety and depression.</p><p>MORE HOUSE CALL</p><p>* Harlan Coben's Start in Suburbia Began With Rumors and Suspense</p><p>* Taylor Tomlinson's Road to Stand-Up Began in Barbieland</p><p>* Small-Town Life Helped Sissy Spacek Prize Drama</p><p>The prescription drugs he took resulted in insomnia, which eventually prevented him from working. My mother, Lina, stepped up and took a job at a local drug store.</p><p>As our family's financial pressures grew, so did my mother's resentment. My fear of their impending battles heightened my sensitivity, and I became the peacemaker.</p><p>Music came early. My brother, Dan, who was four years older than me, was cool—and restless. I watched my two brothers try to write a rock 'n' roll song. Since Bob was 14, he stuck to it. Dan, who was 11, lost his patience.</p><p>Danny turned me on to a lot of rock and R&amp;B, and I yearned to play an instrument and start a band. I borrowed his old Kay nylon-string acoustic guitar. In high school, I took lessons from the big brother of a friend who taught me to play folk. I also hung around guitar-playing friends. We'd sit on a lawn after school and trade tunes and chords.</p><p>In my senior year, I formed Second Helping, a folk-rock band. We were good enough that we recorded a single, \"Let Me In.\" This motivated us to become a working band, make money and become stars.</p><p>First, we needed original material. Writing lyrics was never a problem for me. I was drawn to poetry.</p><p>After graduation but before I started Pasadena City College, I went on a date with a girl and two other couples from high school. As we drove home, I realized I'd moved beyond this scene and wanted more, but I wasn't sure what.</p><p>As we passed the Tower, a mellow folk-dance club in Pasadena, I asked the guy driving to pull over. I got out and said goodnight.</p><p>Inside the club, the owner was about to drive people up to San Francisco for a peace rally. Invited to join, I got into the car and off we went.</p><p>After that summer, I returned home and attended college, majoring in music. But I didn't have the discipline to study formally, so I switched to telecommunications.</p><p>I also began going to concerts by great rock artists and groups. In the middle of my sophomore year at Pasadena, I was asked to join the Electric Prunes.</p><p>My father was concerned. I said to him, \"Dad, I'm spending 90% of my time doing something I don't want to do and only 10% doing what I love—music.\" He said, \"I get it.\"</p><p>I dropped out of college and joined the band. In 1970, I was introduced to Jim Messina, who had been in Buffalo Springfield and Poco, and was a producer at Columbia Records.</p><p>The following year, when we finished working on my first album for the label, we called it \"Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina Sittin' In.\" Then we became Loggins &amp; Messina.</p><p>Today, I live near Santa Barbara. I moved into my current house five years ago. It's on an acre and a half, and I love that it's quiet and surrounded by trees.</p><p>In 1979, my father needed an operation to clear arterial blockage. He said he was prepared to die. Upset that he wasn't fighting, I went to singer-pianist Michael McDonald's house and wrote lyrics to a song we called \"This Is It.\"</p><p>The next day, after Dad's operation, I brought the tape to the hospital. When I played him the song, it included the line, \"For once in your life / Here's your miracle / Stand up and fight.\" I feared he might be offended. Instead, we had a good cry.</p><p>Kenny's Realm</p><p>House view? If you stand in the right spot, you can see the Pacific.</p><p>Coolest new thing? Rockit, my new Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.</p><p>Words or music? I almost always write the music to songs first, then the lyrics.</p><p>King of yacht rock? Actually, Michael McDonald and I probably share that title.</p><p>Not offended? Not at all. King is a pretty good title.</p><p> Kenny Loggins Was 'Terrified' The First Time He Was Asked to Perform</p>",
