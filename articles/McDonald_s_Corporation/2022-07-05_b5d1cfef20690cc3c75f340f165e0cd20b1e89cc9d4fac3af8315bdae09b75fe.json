  "text": "<p>Police have detained a “person of interest” over a shooting at a July 4 parade in an affluent suburb of Chicago on Monday that left six people dead and dozens more injured, the latest mass shooting in a country reeling from attacks at schools, stores and other public spaces. </p> <p>The shooter aimed from a rooftop in downtown Highland Park, a town on the north shore of Lake Michigan about 30 miles from Chicago's central business district.</p> <p>Louis Jogmen, chief of the Highland Park police department, told reporters that authorities had taken 22-year-old Robert E Crimo III into custody “without incident”.</p> <p>The attack followed a string of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/f26af3aa-65cf-4371-b2e1-9445f8696117\">mass shootings in the US</a>, including the assault in May at an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ffef54d-c9a9-4d35-b638-70a76d2dcd88\">elementary school in Uvalde, Texas</a>, by an 18-year-old man who killed 19 pupils and two teachers. An 18-year-old white supremacist was accused of gunning down 10 black patrons at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, using an assault rifle earlier that month. </p> <p>The bloodshed prompted the US Congress to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8a1fc16-812f-443e-aa06-e14ab8a6501d\">pass bipartisan legislation</a> strengthening restrictions on gun ownership, including more stringent background checks for purchases and allowing states to introduce “red flag” laws to prevent dangerous individuals from acquiring guns. However, the law fell short of measures advocated by President Joe Biden and many Democrats. </p> <p>Biden said in a statement on Monday that while the law “will save lives . . . there is much more work to do, and I'm not going to give up fighting the epidemic of gun violence”.</p> <p>The shooting came less than two weeks after the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c88d923-d6f2-402a-a5af-f40fbba762d0\">Supreme Court struck down</a> a New York state law that required individuals to show “proper cause” to carry a concealed gun in public, while recognising a constitutional right to carry firearms for self-defence.</p> <p>Video from the scene of the shooting in Highland Park showed spectators fleeing a street lined by brick commercial buildings, leaving folding chairs and baby strollers behind. “On a day that we came together to celebrate community and freedom, we're instead mourning the tragic loss of life and struggling with the terror that was brought upon us,” Nancy Rotering, mayor of Highland Park, told reporters. </p> <p>Authorities said they recovered a high-powered rifle from the scene. </p> <p>The Highland Park shooting was the 23rd mass shooting in the Chicago metropolitan area this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The previous 22 incidents left 13 people dead and 94 injured.</p> <p>The region has been shaken in recent months by multiple high-profile shootings. In May, a gunman opened fire outside a McDonald's restaurant in Chicago's Near North Side neighbourhood, killing two people and injuring seven. Days before, a 16-year-old was shot and killed in Millennium Park, a tourist attraction adjacent to the Loop business district.</p> <p>There has been a surge in gun violence in Chicago during the pandemic and crime has been under a greater spotlight over the past year, as incidents that tended to be concentrated in the city's poorer south and west sides have spilled into wealthier downtown and north-side neighbourhoods.</p><p>Source: Stefania Palma in Washington and Steff Chávez in Chicago 2022 'Police detain ‘person of interest' after deadly July 4 shooting in Chicago suburb' FT.com 5 July.
