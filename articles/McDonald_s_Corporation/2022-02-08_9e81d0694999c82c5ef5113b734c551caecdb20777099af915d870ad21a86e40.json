  "text": "<p>Some freedom-loving Floridians have worried that newcomers who have fled dysfunctional governance up north will bring blue-state politics with them. But whether imported or home-grown, these days Floridians seem inclined to leave Democrats behind. Ms. Rodriguez interviews the head of a Democratic super PAC who is urging donors not to write off the Sunshine State:</p><p>There are \"folks who are kind of abandoning the state and we said, 'We've invested too much time, energy and resources and we are going to continue investing because Florida is too critical of a state,'\" said Nathalie Rayes, president and CEO of Latino Victory Fund. \"We cannot build national Latino political power without investing in Florida. The state must always, always, always be part of the equation.\"</p><p>Democrats are facing an uphill battle this year in Florida â€” home to the third largest Hispanic population in the country. After a series of bruising losses over the last three election cycles, the state's status as the nation's largest swing state has been put into question.</p><p>In 2020, Joe Biden lost the state by more than three percentage points. While he won the majority of the Florida Latino vote, Donald Trump made some of his most impressive gains with Latinos there. Late last year, Florida Republicans officially outnumbered Democrats in registered voters for the first time in state history.</p><p>Democrats might expect to enjoy a cheering crowd within the friendly confines of the Tampa Bay Times. But the newspaper slammed the state party in a recent editorial:</p><p>If Democrats think their problem is only messaging, the hurdles they face this election year are higher than they imagine. The party has taken its core constituencies for granted. It has seemed incapable of unifying or appearing competent enough to govern. And it has been tone-deaf or AWOL on its historic priorities, from public education to open government...</p><p>Democrats are only now waking up to the risks of not fully appreciating their traditional constituencies, having treated Hispanics as a monolith for so long while ignoring the nuanced interests of Black voters. Cesar Ramirez, the president of the Hispanic Caucus within the party, told the Times/Herald Tallahassee bureau that Joe Biden's lackluster performance against then-President Donald Trump among Hispanics in Miami-Dade has jolted Democrats to become more sensitized to the varied interests of Hispanic groups. Many Black, urban voters are also more conservative on a range of social issues than their white, progressive counterparts, notably on school choice. Democrats need to spend more time listening to voters between elections.</p><p>This column is old enough to remember when media pundits were forecasting that the sensible Covid policies of Gov. Ron DeSantis (R., Fla.) would come at great political cost. It seems his opponents are now wondering if he'll ever lose again.</p><p>***</p><p>Carl Icahn's War on Breakfast Bargains</p><p>As inflation surges, middle-class consumers won't be thrilled to learn that a financier worth an estimated $17 billion has been waging a campaign to force McDonald's to change the way it makes sausage. Specifically, investor Carl Icahn wants pork suppliers to give the animals more space in their crates. \"Animals are one of the things I feel really emotional about,\" hetells the Journal's Cara Lombardo. People on the other side of Mr. Icahn in his various fights over corporate governance probably had no idea he was such a sensitive guy. This column has no desire to hurt Mr. Icahn's feelings, but hopes that he might also consider the feelings of families trying to stretch their food dollar in an era of declining real wages.</p><p>It won't necessarily be easy for the billionaire to relate to the average McDonald's consumer. Ms. Lombardo reports:</p><p>Mr. Icahn's interest in McDonald's doesn't extend to eating its products (his tastes run more toward vodka martinis and penne pasta). He thinks he ate at McDonald's once, roughly 20 years ago.</p><p>***</p><p>Xi Jinping's Sports Spectacle</p><p>\"My father Elie Wiesel would have been ashamed of Beijing Olympics,\" is the headline on a Jerusalem Post commentary today from Elisha Wiesel, who writes:</p><p>Most of the world didn't seem to know, or care, that the host country is hosting a pageant of \"peace and friendship\" while simultaneously terrorizing its Uyghur minority.</p><p>The Chinese government's systematic oppression of the Uyghurs, a Muslim group in northwest China, is not the Holocaust. But although we may not have seen this particular movie, we know the genre.</p><p>I have heard the painful testimony of Uyghur dissidents, who manage to get the word out despite a media clampdown that makes it almost impossible for the Western press to report on the facts. Forced internment camps target people for thought crimes and racial affiliation. Medical data suggests that forced sterilizations are taking place among this targeted racial group. Families have been forcibly separated and threatened into silence.</p><p>Just like in 1936, the International Olympic Committee is unwilling to push the issue.</p><p>***</p><p>Annals of Lockdown Consequences</p><p>The National of Bureau of Economic Research reports:</p><p>The number of deaths from drug overdoses and alcohol abuse rose during the first 16 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the many factors that may have contributed to these developments, explored in a new study by NBER research associate Casey Mulligan of the University of Chicago, is an increase in the disposable income of some at-risk households as a result of pandemic-related stimulus payments. This income rise coincided with a decline in the effective price of consuming alcohol and some addictive drugs.</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Lisa Rossi helps compile Best of the Web.
