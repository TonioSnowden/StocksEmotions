  "title": "Boards, Security Chiefs Face Challenges Over New Cyber Rules; Cybersecurity executives to seek ways to make information easy for board directors to assimilate",
  "text": "<p>The proposals, now open for public comment, indicate the SEC is getting tougher as pervasive cyberattacks cost victims billions of dollars a year, according to estimates from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p><p>Not everyone is happy with the proposals.</p><p>The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a lobbying group for asset managers, expressed concern over the breadth of the proposed rules. In a letter sent to the SEC dated April 11, Sifma said that while companies should have processes in place to escalate cyber issues to boards, directors shouldn't be expected to manage them directly.</p><p>\"We believe the requirement that boards approve policies and procedures and exercise formal oversight is too prescriptive and crosses into the realm of management,\" Sifma said.</p><p>The SEC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>But others say they provide much-needed clarity on expectations from watchdogs, as cybersecurity has become a core business risk for companies of all sizes.</p><p>\"I think it's a reset, and I think the advantage of this reset is they're being very clear. They're telling you what they expect,\" said Cyrus Vance Jr., partner and global chair of law firm Baker McKenzie LLP's cybersecurity practice.</p><p>In practice, security chiefs say, this means that CISOs and others with cyber responsibilities must learn how to translate cybersecurity data into clear risk information that nontechnical board directors can quickly understand.</p><p>This may force some companies to rethink the role itself, said Shaun Marion, CISO at fast-food chain McDonald's Corp. He said that when he landed his first cybersecurity executive position in 2011, he lacked experience interacting with a corporate board and didn't receive much help. \"My first board meeting was sink or swim,\" he said. \"I wouldn't say I swam.\"</p><p>The SEC's call for senior leaders and directors to understand and disclose more about their company's cybersecurity posture will require a strong relationship between the CISO and the board, he said.</p><p>\"It will change how we develop the next generation of CISOs,\" he said, relying less on technical knowledge and more on business-risk experience.</p><p>Additionally, companies may have to examine the composition of their boards more closely in light of the rules and the heightened threat environment. Steven Babb, CISO at Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group's investor services business, said many boards often suffer from a lack of technical knowledge, which can translate to improper management of risks.</p><p>\"I think across boards, globally, there is a lack of understanding as to not just technology, but security in terms of how important it is to an organization, but equally the impact on an organization if there is an IT or a broader security incident,\" he said.</p><p>Installing directors with cybersecurity expertise can help the rest of the board grasp these issues, said Baker McKenzie's Mr. Vance. Until the end of 2021, Mr. Vance served three consecutive terms as Manhattan district attorney.</p><p>\"There is thought that's going to need to go into who your directors are, and how we are intelligently manning boards that have supervision over cyber risk,\" he said.</p><p>Companies have been adding such expertise to their senior ranks in recent years, although many still lack it, according to research from financial rating agency Moody's Investors Service. A survey of 1,300 companies published March 31 found that around 56% of financial companies had some cyber expertise on their boards, compared with 49% of nonfinancial businesses, 37% of infrastructure issuers and 36% of public-sector entities.</p><p>But simply having cyber experts on boards isn't sufficient to meet the SEC's new demands, said Chris Hetner, an adviser to the National Association of Corporate Directors who previously served as a cybersecurity adviser to former agency chairs Mary Jo White and Jay Clayton.</p><p>He has often seen security staff engage with that member alone, using the director as an interpreter for other board members, who then assume that their more technical peer has the situation in hand.</p><p>\"Invariably, what happens is the balance of the board totally checks out,\" he said. Instead, Mr. Hetner said, CISOs and other staff will have to find ways to convey the issues they're facing in language board members are conversant inâ€”business risks, the cost of mitigating them and the resources needed to manage future risks.</p><p>Mitsubishi UFJ's Mr. Babb said that generally speaking, enhancements to governance processes within companies are welcome.</p><p>\"Anything that really raises the profile and the risks relating to security up at a board level can only, I believe, promote and enhance security practices,\" he said.</p><p>Kim S.
