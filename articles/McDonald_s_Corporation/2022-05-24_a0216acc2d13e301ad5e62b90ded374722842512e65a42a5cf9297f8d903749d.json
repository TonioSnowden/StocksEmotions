  "title": "McDonald's Poised to Retain Both Seats in Proxy Fight With Carl Icahn; Activist investor had challenged the fast-food chain over suppliers' treatment of animals",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Icahn's animal-rights campaign had been seen as a longshot from the start, given that it was a far cry from his typical activist battle. It didn't present obvious financial upside to McDonald's shareholders, and he had a tiny McDonald's stake, meaning he needed to convince a larger-than-normal portion of shareholders to support his cause.</p><p>Mr. Icahn could cast the campaign as a partial victory given it raised awareness of the issue, which he first got involved in 10 years ago at the behest of his daughter and the Humane Society of the United States.</p><p>Heather Haddon contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com and Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.com</p><p>McDonald's Poised to Retain Both Seats in Proxy Fight With Carl Icahn</p>",
