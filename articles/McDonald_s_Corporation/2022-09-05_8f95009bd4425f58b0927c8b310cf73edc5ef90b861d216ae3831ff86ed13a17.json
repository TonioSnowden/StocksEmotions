  "title": "Fast Food Wages Could Increase to $22 an Hour in California; Gov. Gavin Newsom signs bill into law on Labor Day, creating a state council to set minimum fast food wages",
  "text": "<p>Passing the measure was a top lobbying priority for state and national leaders of the Service Employees International Union, who were also involved in the continuing national \"Fight for $15\" campaign to raise minimum wages across the country to $15 an hour.</p><p>California's current minimum wage is $15 an hour, and is set to increase by 50 cents on Jan. 1.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Newsom said the law would give fast food workers a \"stronger voice and seat at the table to set fair wages and critical health and safety standards across the industry.\"</p><p>\"We've long had a formula, a formula for success around growth and inclusion,\" Mr. Newsom said in a video statement released Monday. \"I'm proud, on Labor Day, to sign that bill and enshrine it in law.\"</p><p>Mr. Newsom signed the bill just days after it passed the state Legislature, above objections from McDonald's Corp. and other major fast food brands that lobbied against the legislation.</p><p>In a letter released after the bill's passage by the Legislature, the head of McDonald's U.S. business publicly criticized the bill, saying it unfairly targeted larger chains in the sector and had loopholes for certain restaurants, such as those that bake bread.</p><p>\"This is a clear example of picking 'winners' and 'losers,' which is not the appropriate role of government,\" wrote Joe Erlinger, McDonald's U.S. president, in a message last month. Mr. Erlinger, who was born in California, said it pained him to watch the state \"earn its reputation for driving businesses out.\"</p><p>Some industry opponents said they have held preliminary discussions about the possibility of mounting a referendum campaign that would put the issue before voters as early as next year, and seek to invalidate the law.</p><p>An earlier version of the bill would have made fast food corporations jointly liable for labor violations along with their franchisees, which industry groups fiercely opposed, and would have allowed the council to set sector-wide policy on scheduling and workplace conditions.</p><p>Mr. Newsom and top officials in his administration played a crucial role in last-minute amendments that removed the joint liability provision, capped wage minimums, and curtailed the council's authority, according to several people familiar with negotiations.</p><p>Write to Christine Mai-Duc at christine.maiduc@wsj.com and Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com</p><p>Fast Food Wages Could Increase to $22 an Hour in California</p>",
