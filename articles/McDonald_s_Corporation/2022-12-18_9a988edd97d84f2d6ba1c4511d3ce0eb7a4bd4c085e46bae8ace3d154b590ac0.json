  "title": "How Zion Clark, Fastest Man on Two Hands, Aims to Conquer MMA, Olympics and Paralympics; How an athlete born without legs trains for a singular career that enters a new chapter with a victory in his professional mixed-martial arts debut",
  "text": "<p>Zion Clark has a two-word mantra tattooed in all caps across his muscular back: \"NO EXCUSES.\"</p><p>Embracing that philosophy has helped him achieve extraordinary feats, including multiple Guinness World Records, he says. It has also left him unafraid to set lofty goals, like qualifying for the Olympics and Paralympics in separate sports.</p><p>What's even more remarkable: He was born with no legs.</p><p>A rare condition called Caudal Regression Syndrome is responsible for his missing limbs. He was placed for adoption at birth and bounced between foster homes. \"I was constantly humiliated and made fun of at school,\" says Mr. Clark, now 25. \"Fighting became a mode of survival.\"</p><p>He immediately gravitated to wrestling in elementary school. Despite losing constantly when he began, he stuck with the sport and went on to become a decorated wrestler at Kent State University at Tuscarawas in Ohio. Athletics became his outlet, and he says he became obsessed with showing people anything is possible. In February 2021, he gained attention when he became the fastest man on two hands, setting the Guinness World Record by covering 20 meters on his hands in 4.78 seconds.</p><p>Mr. Clark, who recently moved to Los Angeles, won his MMA fight debut on Saturday against Eugene Murray in Valley Center, Calif.</p><p>\"Wrestling is the basis for almost all fighting, so it's a natural transition,\" he said before the bout. \"If I can beat able-bodied people wrestling, I can beat them fighting.\"</p><p>He also has his eye on the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, where he hopes to become the first American to make both the Olympic and the Paralympic teams in separate sports—wrestling in the former, wheelchair racing in the latter.</p><p>The Workout</p><p>Mr. Clark trains twice a day for up to three hours on Mondays through Thursdays, then uses Fridays and the weekends for recovery. He works with professional mixed-martial artist Antonio McKee at his Lakewood, Calif., gym, Team Bodyshop MMA.</p><p>On Mondays they focus on strikes and takedowns, a technique that involves bringing the opponent to the ground. Tuesdays are devoted to boxing. Wednesdays focus on wrestling. And on Thursdays he spars with other athletes.</p><p>His second workout of the day is at Dogpound, an L.A. gym. He weighs around 95 pounds and can bench press 315 pounds. Strength workouts focus on plyometrics—exercises in which the muscles exert a lot of force in short intervals.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What inspires you to overcome adversity when training?

He wears a weighted vest while he does dips and pull-ups and uses resistance bands to mimic throwing a punch. He also uses a cable machine to work on rotation and core strength. In addition to sprinting on his hands, he uses an assault bike, which is powered by pressing and pulling hand levers.</p><p>Mr. Clark performs box jumps from his hands. He holds the Guinness World Record for that exercise, having jumped a height of 33 inches. He also recently set another Guinness World Record for performing 248 diamond push-ups, where the hands meet together beneath the chest, in under three minutes.</p><p>Recovery is important, and Mr. Clark regularly sees a chiropractor and uses a foam roller. He also receives cupping, a therapy where heated cups are suctioned to the skin to encourage blood flow and increase circulation. His shoulders act as weight-bearing joints for him and are always sore, he says.</p><p>The Diet</p><p>Super food: \"I eat a lot of beef liver, because it's loaded with nutrients,\" Mr. Clark says. Meals: He typically skips breakfast, then has a turkey BLT for lunch and baked chicken for dinner. Drink of choice: Kombucha Splurge: Every now and then he goes to McDonald's and orders a chicken sandwich or Chicken McNuggets.</p><p>Essential Gear</p><p>Apparel: He is sponsored by Legends and wears the brand's shorts, tanks and T-shirts ($40-$60). Recovery: He keeps aches at bay with his Hyperice Hypervolt massage gun and Hyperice Vyper 3 vibrating foam roller ($200) Extra Effort: He often wears the weighted Omorpho G-Vest ($400) when training.</p><p>Playlist</p><p>He has around 2,500 songs on his workout playlist. He's a rap fan and enjoys artists including Drake, Lil Wayne and 2 Chainz.</p><p>Write to Jen Murphy at workout@wsj.com.</p><p>How Zion Clark, Fastest Man on Two Hands, Aims to Conquer MMA, Olympics and Paralympics</p>",
