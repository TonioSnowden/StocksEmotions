  "title": "Carl Icahn Exits Occidental Petroleum After Nearly Three Years; In a letter to the company's board, the activist investor says his two remaining board representatives are also resigning",
  "text": "<p>The activist investor's two representatives on Occidental's board are also resigning, he said in the letter, as was required by a settlement agreementwith the company at the onset of the pandemic.</p><p>Occidental's shares plummeted in March 2020, allowing Mr. Icahn to double down on the investment, boosting his stake from 2.5% to around 10%. By that time, he had been arguing for almost a year that the Anadarko deal was an ill-conceived defensive move and campaigning for the ouster of Chief Executive Vicki Hollub. He also took issue with the $10 billion of pricey financing from Warren Buffett that Occidental relied on to pay for the deal.</p><p>Mr. Buffett has been buying Occidental shares in recent days. As of Friday, Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. reported owning roughly $5 billion worth.</p><p>Within weeks of Mr. Icahn raising his stake, he and Occidental called a truce that brought back former CEO Stephen Chazen as chairman and added three directors, including Mr. Icahn's two representatives. Ms. Hollub remained CEO, and the company announced deep cost cuts.</p><p>Mr. Icahn thanked Mr. Chazen in Sunday's letter, including for supporting his push to issue a free dividend of warrants that he said created over $4 billion of value for Occidental shareholders.</p><p>\"While we certainly had our disagreements with Vicki Hollub concerning M&amp;A, we thank her for using her well-honed operating skills and resiliency so well in Occidental's darkest hours,\" Mr. Icahn wrote. \"We believe our relationship with Occidental turned out to be activism at its best.\"</p><p>With the help of a surge in oil prices, Occidental's shares have more than quintupled after sinking below $10 in 2020. They closed Friday at $56.15, just below where they were before the Anadarko deal was finalized.</p><p>Mr. Icahn realized a profit of around $1 billion on the investment, according to people familiar with the matter. He also has an unrealized net profit of roughly $500 million on the warrants, they said. He said in the letter that he still owns over 15 million warrants.</p><p>Mr. Icahn has recently been focused on a smaller energy company, the utility Southwest Gas Holdings Inc., which last week announced plans to separate a subsidiary he had called for it to sell. He is also running a proxy contest at McDonald's Corp. over its suppliers' treatment of pregnant pigs. The latter is an atypical campaign for Mr. Icahn, who turned 86 last month, as he holds a tiny stake and doesn't expect to turn a profit.</p><p>Write to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com</p><p>Carl Icahn Exits Occidental Petroleum After Nearly Three Years</p>",
