  "text": "<p>One of the very best things about writing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/swamp-notes\">Swamp Notes</a> is the amazing reader feedback that we get. Last week's note on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eddaea67-b381-4eb7-88aa-3a879a744d6b\">supply chain disruption</a> and trade in the post-neoliberal era, pegged to US trade representative Katherine Tai's speech about a new American approach to economic relations with China, received a record number of responses. </p> <p>The majority of you seemed to agree that the Washington consensus is fundamentally broken, and that American trade policy must evolve to take this into account. But you offered up many new angles on how we might think about the “one world, two systems” problem in the future. </p> <p>Below are excerpts from a few of the most thought-provoking letters: </p> <blockquote>  <p>“As someone who bought into and, indeed, for many years as a consultant to the World Bank and similar institutions worked to advance the neoliberal agenda, I find Rana's argument, and the <a href=\"https://www.openmarketsinstitute.org/publications/unmade-in-america\">Barry Lynn essay</a> that underpins, it highly persuasive. </p>  <p>The real issue is the vulnerability of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/us-economy\">US economy</a> to supply chain disruptions, which the Covid-19 pandemic has brought into sharp relief. And the causes of this vulnerability? American tax policy, for one, which encourages corporations to keep their profits offshore and effectively subsidises corporate debt. [And the] admission of China into the World Trade Organization. Also, a naive trust in the Tom Friedman ‘the world is flat' fallacy (including the profound observation that no two countries that have a McDonald's have ever gone to war with each other). </p>  <p>American companies over the past few decades lost sight of the original impetus behind much outward foreign direct investment, which was to locate production closer to end markets — effectively shortening supply chains — and instead stretched those supply chains past the breaking point. </p>  <p>What is the solution? Managed trade between the US and China is, at best, irrelevant and mostly for show. A trend towards reshoring, or bringing production back home, has more promise. Reshoring did not start with the Biden administration, but it will get a boost from [its] proposed incentives to move strategically important processes and production back to the US.” — C<em>harles Krakoff, Burlington, Vermont</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote>  <p>“In the face-off between Rana and Ed, there appears to be a fundamental difference about who benefits. Rana's focus is on citizens as workers; Ed, citizens as consumers. Free trade works great for consumers but there is ample evidence the incidence of the policy falls on workers in import competing industries. For your next debate, you should resolve this question — the dollar's reserve currency status requires the US to absorb the world's imports to provide dollars to the rest of the world; is the reserve status worth it?” <em>— Bill O'Grady, St Louis, Missouri</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote>  <p>“Trade with China has been a significant contributor to America's prosperity since the beginning of the republic, and indeed since before that. After all, the tea that ended up in Boston harbour was from China. </p>  <p>Perhaps most relevant to the current situation, in those decades prior to the opium wars, the Qing rulers were keenly aware that their goods were in demand throughout the west, and they made the most of that advantage to determine the terms, and even the mechanics, of the trade. </p>  <p>For example, around 1800 the Qing permitted the British and Americans to trade fur at Canton, but they required the Russians to bring their furs overland to a place called Kyakhta on the frontier between Siberia and Mongolia [which reduced their price]. </p>  <p>History shows us is that if we want to look at the China trade from the Chinese point of view, we might try to find places where they have created advantages that allow them to dictate the modes of trade, and how they may play their various trading partners off against each other.” — <em>Jonathan Tiemann, Atherton, California</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote>  <p>“What is discouraging about this whole discussion is that no one talks about the elephant in the room: capital. The defining element of international trade now is not goods but capital sloshing from one end of the planet to the other, disrupting people's lives as [it] does so. To take just one example, millions of Americans jobs were rendered ‘uncompetitive' after trillions of dollars of Chinese ‘savings' were dumped into American Treasury bonds, thus rigging the relative values of the dollar and the renminbi in favour of Chinese manufacturers. The source of the excess capital — the notorious ‘savings glut' — is, of course, economic inequality, since the rich, unlike the poor and middle classes, save most of their income. So for the US administration to concentrate on tariffs is basically useless.” —<em> Walter Gingery, Seattle, Washington </em></p> </blockquote> <h2>Rana Foroohar responds</h2> <p>I completely agree that capital is the next stage of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/us-china-trade-dispute\">US-China economic conflict</a>. Walter is right that the dysfunctional economic dance between the two countries is even more about the imbalances and inequalities created by unfettered capital flows than it is about the particulars of physical trade or the mechanism for controlling it. Michael Pettis has been particularly articulate about this point in his blog and book, <em>Trade Wars Are Class Wars</em>. </p> <p>Bill raises the key point here, which is whether the dollar's status as a global reserve is more exorbitant burden or exorbitant privilege. My answer to that has to do with timing. Ultimately, I think it makes sense for the world to move to a currency system based on a basket reserve that represents many countries, as John Maynard Keynes argued for in Bretton Woods. If his “bancor” currency would have won the day, the trade and currency imbalances between the US and China wouldn't exist in the same way or certainly to the same extent that they do today. </p> <p>That said, do I hope that the dollar can keep its status as global reserve for long enough for the Biden administration to fund some infrastructure and build back better at home? Absolutely. America is in a race to use its ability to borrow in order to do something good with fiscal policy. But China would love to move its own trade partners towards the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cc6720b-2089-41e2-9204-7599b48a82af\">digital renminbi</a>, and multiple countries are experimenting with their own central bank-backed digital currencies. Couple this with the risk of stagflation, and the chances that a wrong move by the Federal Reserve could blow up asset markets, and you might see the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/68e5f028-a1a1-11ea-94c2-0526869b56b0\">post-dollar world</a> come around sooner rather than later. As I wrote a while back, that would be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74d753db-6ba9-42cc-bf9f-745730370c3d\">very disruptive</a> to anyone holding much debt or dollar-based assets. </p> <p>I've just finished writing a book on what I believe the post-neoliberal world will look like. And I, like Charles, think it will be much more regional and local than what came before — everything from the cost of energy, to climate change, to the rise of decentralised technologies, makes that highly likely. That's not to say that ideas and capital, and to a certain extent goods and people, won't travel across borders. But I think that regional networks and relationships will matter much more, for all kinds of reasons. As Jonathan points out, China has always been adept at leveraging networks and playing nodes within them to its own advantage. If the US and Europe want to compete well in the new world, they'll have to find a way to do this better. </p> <h2>Recommended reading</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Which brings me to my first recommended read — a fascinating academic paper by Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman, <a href=\"https://direct.mit.edu/isec/article/44/1/42/12237/Weaponized-Interdependence-How-Global-Economic\">“Weaponized Interdependence: How Global Economic Networks Shape State Coercion.</a>” It's 37 pages long, but worth a very close read for more insight on the topic above. The authors argue that nations — like companies — that can leverage the network effect will own the 21st century. </p></li>  <li><p>On a completely different topic, this New Yorker article by the novelist Gary Shteyngart on his <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/10/11/a-botched-circumcision-and-its-aftermath\">botched circumcision and its aftermath</a> (I feel you all wincing) is magazine feature writing at its best. Don't worry, it's as much funny as it is painful. </p></li>  <li><p>Finally, in the FT, Tom Mitchell did a great job summing up the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4018362-7f61-48cc-931c-a4ebc216c10c\">stakes of the Evergrande crisis for Xi</a>, and Stephen Roach had interesting things to say about<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99eacd37-a2e0-4c74-b6de-99c1ca7caa70\"> inflation</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Catch up on previous Swamp Notes on </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/swamp-notes\"><em>FT.com</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Source: Rana Foroohar  2021 'The post-neoliberal world: readers' edition' FT.com 18 October.
