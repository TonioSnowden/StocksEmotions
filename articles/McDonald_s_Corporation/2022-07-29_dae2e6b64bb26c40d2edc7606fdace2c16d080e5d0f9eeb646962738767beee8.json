  "text": "<p>Details about the sandwiches are scarce for now, but during the test process, they were served with the chain's blue cheese and ranch dipping sauces.</p><p>\"The results of our market tests showcased the opportunity to launch the sandwich nationally achieving our targeted sales mix levels of approximately 4%, while maintaining the simplicity of our operations,\" said Michael Skipworth, Wingstop's chief executive, on the earnings call, according to FactSet.</p><p>See: Outback parent Bloomin' Brands beats on earnings and raises revenue outlook but revises profit guidance below expectations</p><p>Skipworth said the sandwich was a good fit for the lunchtime period. He also talked up the company's confidence in its full-year guidance for low-single-digit same-store sales growth, which not only relies on new items, but core chicken wings and value bundles.</p><p>\"[W]e are experiencing meaningful deflation in our business as the price of wings has normalized from unusually high levels in 2021,\" he said.</p><p>Wingstop WING shares were up 5.6% on Friday following the second-quarter earnings announcement, and have rallied more than 66% over the past month. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index SPX is up 8.4% for the last month.</p><p>Stifel downgraded Wingstop to hold from buy and maintained its $120 price target.</p><p>\"We have a favorable view of the company's near-term sales outlook and longer-term growth prospects, but with the stock now at our 12-month target price, we believe the near-term risk/reward has become more balanced,\" analysts wrote.</p><p>Benchmark's analysts noted the success the company has already enjoyed from one of its bundles: a boneless wing value deal that included 20 boneless wings, two dips and large french fries priced at $15.99. The deal was introduced just when lower-income customers, who make up a \"sizeable\" portion of Wingstop's customer base, started to feel the squeeze of inflation, Benchmark notes.</p><p>And: Robots are making french fries, chicken wings and more as restaurant kitchens gear up for an automated future</p><p>Don't miss: Where can you try McDonald's meatless McPlant burger?
