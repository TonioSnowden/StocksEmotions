  "text": "<p>It was the longest I'd ever queued for a hamburger. The line at Pushkin Square snaked back and forth through the biting winter afternoon for an eternity as it made its way around the one of the latest attractions of post-Communist Moscow. Fast food it wasn't.</p> <p>But then the attraction of McDonald's in the Russian capital was never really about the speed with which it dispensed relatively pricey burgers and shakes. The arrival of the golden arches in Moscow some 32 years ago symbolised a full throated embrace of western consumer culture (even if it came with Soviet-style queues). It gave Muscovites a chance to taste the fruits of the reforms unleashed by Mikhail Gorbachev a few years earlier. And it would go on to feed the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/08/opinion/foreign-affairs-big-mac-i.html\">breezy 1990s hubris</a> about how the arrival of McDonald's marked the moment that a country had reached a stage of economic development that made conflict with other states all but impossible. </p> <p>Either way, it was novel enough to lure my mother, sister and me to Pushkin Square. For us it also held an added poignancy. Our father was a diplomat and we had lived in Moscow in the late 1970s, the high watermark of Brezhnev-era “stagnation”. The city our family returned to just over a decade later, in the dying days of the Soviet Union, was something else. </p> <p>That is all history now, of course — a fact underscored by this week's <a href=\"https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/ourstories.mcd-exit-russia.html\">announcement</a> by McDonald's that, in the wake of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, it intends to sell its Russian business. With the process of “de-arching” now under way, and with other western brands quitting the country, the McDonald's move highlights a broader, more profound reversal of the path Russia embarked on following the end of communism. </p> <p>Where that leads remains unclear. Putin's desire to recreate what he regards as the glory and grandeur of the Soviet era is undoubted. The Russian president's martial rhetoric, as well as the brute force of his military, have been accompanied by an unsettling revival in Soviet-era imagery and iconography. </p> <p>But does anyone seriously want to go back to the USSR? And if so, what exactly is it they want to return to? </p> <p>The Russia that our family encountered in the late 1970s was a global superpower, the equal of the US, commanding respect and instilling fear in equal measure. For ordinary Russians, life was an ordered, predictable affair in which someone else made the big decisions. Things may not have been as efficient or as glossy as they were in the west, but in its own clunky way the system delivered relative prosperity — high rise apartments, boxy cars — and material improvement. As Sheila Fitzpatrick notes in her book <em>The Shortest History of the Soviet Union</em>, it “may have been the best of Soviet times or the most boring, depending on your point of view. But nobody has ever said it was the worst of times.” </p> <p>To get there was to pass through the proverbial looking glass into a different world. The most notable difference to life in the west was the consumer experience. In place of brash billboard ads, Moscow offered a seemingly endless display of agitprop celebrating the general and inevitable triumph of organised labour or the specific achievements of a particular group of workers. Jeans, electronics and — yes — burgers were non-existent or only available in pale local imitations (hence the thrill when the “real thing” arrived). </p> <p>For a young western boy this was strange, but not without its charms. We enjoyed an existence that seemed to belong to a different age — ice hockey and cross-country skiing in winter; excursions to dachas and river swimming in the summer. </p> <p>Of course there was another side to the story — one from which the authorities did their best to shield us, while being sure to keep us under close surveillance. The state terror of earlier decades may have receded but the KGB and the prison camps lived on. Yes, there may have been more consumer durables than in Stalinist times, but the system was fundamentally broken and corrupt — as Gorbachev realised. </p> <p>Given the subsequent social and economic turbulence of the Boris Yeltsin era in the 1990s, it is perhaps understandable that a certain nostalgia for more ordered, seemingly simpler times should emerge. It was a collective impulse that Putin would exploit. </p> <p>For a while he tried to mix and match different traditions, blending freewheeling western consumerism with Russophile authoritarianism. That was arguably always a doomed prospect. The war in Ukraine has confirmed it. Now Russians could find that excessive nostalgia induces neuralgia. Maybe hold the fries. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:frederick.studemann@ft.com\"><em>frederick.studemann@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><strong>Letters in response to this column:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11f2e831-131f-47a4-b91e-e8bc144798c4\"><em>Back to the USSR — in pursuit of a simpler life</em></a><em> / </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11f2e831-131f-47a4-b91e-e8bc144798c4\"><em>From Mario Gargiulo, Verona, Italy</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67ae0477-b936-411c-af24-dd63f1367078\"><em>Companies shouldn't give up on fast return to Russia / From Giles Conway-Gordon, Ronan, MT, US</em></a></p><p>Source: Frederick Studemann 2022 'McDonald's departure from Moscow marks the end of an era' FT.com 20 May.
