  "title": "11 Flights, 6 Airlines, 4 Days: A Flying Test of the U.S. Travel System; Over a marathon weekend of flying around the country, few problem flights but plenty of challenges as passengers and airlines try to keep going",
  "text": "<p>It wasn't supposed to go that way. A multicity journey during a summer when airlines—and passengers—are struggling to keep it together seemed like a recipe for misery, at least to my editors and friends. I envisioned writing this column while stranded at an airport hotel waiting for an airline to rebook my canceled flights or track down a lost bag.</p><p>But the worst thing I encountered was a 2.5-hour delay out of Newark, N.J., and a 30-minute security line in Atlanta. Plenty of travelers faced far worse, but overall airlines canceled a fraction of the flights they did during the busy Juneteenth and Father's Day weekendsin mid-June.</p><p>Airlines canceled 1,800 flights between Friday and Monday and delayed another 21,300 with an average delay time of 49 minutes, according to flight-tracking firm FlightAware. That compares with nearly 1,500 cancellations on the Friday before Father's Day alone.</p><p>Credit the absence of widespread summer storms and, according to one expert, operational improvements airlines are making in the face of public pressure from the Transportation Department to reduce delays and cancellations.</p><p>\"They did everything they could to protect flights over the 4th of July,\" says William McGee, a veteran airline consumer advocate and senior fellow for aviation and travel at the American Economic Liberties Project, a nonprofit focused on competition. \"The real test will be how we do the rest of July.\"</p><p>Mr. McGee, who returned from a nine-day trip to Europe on Friday, says he was \"floored\" when I told him how smoothly things went as I traversed the country on packed planes. </p><p>PHOTO: John Dykes</p><p>System Test</p><p>The adventure wasn't entirely pleasant. Every airport concourse was overrun, especially during boarding as travelers crowded departure gates, ignoring messages over the loudspeakers urging people to embark in the correct order. Lines awaited those in search of bathrooms, preflight snacks and shopping, restaurants and airport lounges. One airport lounge in Seattle closed at 3:30 p.m. Sunday due to staffing.</p><p>At Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport Saturday night, it was hard to tell where the line for McDonald's ended and the line for Popeye's Chicken began. The airport hotel in Austin, Texas, I checked into at 12:30 a.m. Monday for a few hours' sleep sent me to a room with the door wide open and forgot my 4 a.m. wake-up call. A room I booked at Denver's airport had stunning sunrise views, a comfy bed and a $400 nightly rate. Deplaning was agonizingly slow, in-flight Wi-Fi service spotty. It was frustrating and exhausting at times, but tolerable.</p><p>Airlines have struggled mightilysince Memorial Day weekend, their operations so stretched Delta Air Lines took the unusual step of offering passengers a free out if they wanted to avoid peak Independence Day weekend travel days.</p><p>My itinerary was hardly a scientific sample, though I tried to hit current travel stress points and a variety of airlines and routes.</p><p>I flew American, United, Delta, Southwest, Alaska, Spirit and hit 12 airports, from the country's busiest airports as well as tiny Glacier Park International Airport in Kalispell, Mont. The shortest flight was a 47-minute Spirit hop from Los Angeles to Las Vegas on Monday, the longest a nearly four-hour haul from Seattle to Austin late Sunday. I checked a bag on two flights and skipped the TSA PreCheck and Clear lanes in Atlanta and Orlando, Fla. Airlines and airports weren't informed of my plans. I traveled largely as a plebeian—the only airline where I have status is Southwest, where the main perk is early boarding, since the airline doesn't assign seats.</p><p>Away We Go</p><p>The biggest snag happened on my first flight.</p><p>In the Uber on the way to Newark Liberty International Airport at sunrise Friday, United Airlines texted me about a flight delay. At the airport, more delay alerts. My flight to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., ended up taking off 2.5 hours late, including a 30-minute wait to take off given a conga line of planes.</p><p>Tracey McNeil heeded warnings to arrive extra early, so with the delay spent more than four hours at Newark. Ms. McNeil, on her way to visit her brother for his annual beach fish fry and barbecue, told me she had prepared for the worst and considered this a hiccup.</p><p>\"I learned how to be patient in life as I got older because it's not going to change anything,\" the 58-year-old says.</p><p>Southwest came closest to derailing my plans with a projected eight-hour delay Saturday morning for a flight to Orlando from Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.</p><p>The 8:40 a.m. flight showed on time when I arrived at O'Hare just after 6:30 a.m., but a red delay banner flashed on the airline's app soon after. Passengers in the gate area harrumphed and shared their screens with each other as phones pinged with text alerts warning of delays possibly stretching into late afternoon. Our gate agent told us the wait would be shorter, and attributed the delay to air-traffic control complications in Florida, which can resolve quickly, so she warned travelers not to stray too far from the gate.</p><p>She was right, announcing \"we're back on time\" just before 8 a.m. to cheers from passengers in the gate.</p><p>My seatmate, Minnesota resident Angela Bennett, nearly missed the flight. She and her daughter, traveling to a dance competition, were near the food court when they were paged.</p><p>\"I'm just glad we got on the airplane,\" she says. </p><p>Passengers wait to board a United Airlines flight at Newark Liberty International Airport on Friday. PHOTO: Dawn Gilbertson/ The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Taking the Long Way</p><p>That is not to say flight woes didn't upend plenty of weekend getaways.</p><p>Philip Finelli awoke Friday to a text message from American. His family's nonstop morning flight from Philadelphia to Miami was canceled. He searched American's website for alternatives that would get them to Miami or any place in South Florida on Friday, including flights out of Newark and New York. He came up empty.</p><p>The family was rebooked on a Saturday flight from Philadelphia to Miami, via Orlando. They missed a boat reservation on Saturday but were able to reschedule.</p><p>\"It's frustrating but you need to move on and make the best of what we've got left,\" Mr. Finelli says.</p><p>Bryce Manderfield has top-tier status on American and was stunned last weekend when he was quoted an 8 ½-hour wait to reach the elite customer-service desk after some Friday flight cancellations.</p><p>American helped him but he had to take a tortured path to a speaking engagement in Orlando on Saturday, flying into Miami at 3:30 a.m., waiting an hour to pick up a rental car and then driving 3 ½ hours to Orlando on little sleep. He made the event. And flew again the next day.</p><p>My holiday travel itinerary had many more legs and far less stress. Mr. McGee, the consumer advocate, suggested I place a bet in Las Vegas, my last stop.</p><p>\"Boy are you lucky,\" he says. \"You were really pushing the envelope there.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How did you navigate Fourth of July travel?
