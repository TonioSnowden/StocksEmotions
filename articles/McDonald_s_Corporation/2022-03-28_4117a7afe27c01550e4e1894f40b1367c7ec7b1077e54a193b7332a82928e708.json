  "title": "U.S. News: Debate Brews Over Breeding Pigs' Stalls",
  "text": "<p>The state of California, animal-welfare groups like the Humane Society of the United States and billionaire investor Carl Icahn are pressing fast-food giants like McDonald's Corp., meatpacking companies and hog farmers like Mr. Deahr to provide pregnant hogs more space.</p><p>Animal-welfare proponents say the crates confine sows to the degree that they can barely turn around or walk.</p><p>\"All they can do is stand on a hard, bare floor, eat, and lay down in place,\" said Maisie Ganzler, chief strategy and brand officer for Bon Appetit Management Co. Ms. Ganzler, one of Mr. Icahn's two nominees to McDonald's board in his proxy contest, said switching to pork raised outside of crates recently increased costs for her institutional catering company, but the move aligned with what her customers wanted.</p><p>Pork producers and suppliers are resisting, saying such moves would raise meat prices by causing farmers to spend millions of dollars changing their operations, create supply-chain chaos and risk their pigs' health.</p><p>Sows are aggressive, said Mike Paustian, a farmer in Walcott, Iowa. The stalls prevent them from fighting each other and stop larger sows from stealing food from smaller ones.</p><p>\"Farmers have tried different ways of housing them over the years. Individual gestation stalls allow you to do a better job of monitoring individual sows,\" said Mr. Paustian, who sells his pigs to Tyson Foods Inc. and Smithfield Foods Inc.</p><p>Mr. Deahr sells his pigs to Tyson, but another large meatpacker approached him recently with an offer to pay him an $8-a-pig premium to not use gestation crates, he said. While it is a good offer, Mr. Deahr said he can't accept it because of his own animal-welfare concerns. The stalls are needed to protect the sows for at least the six days when they are at their most aggressive, he said.</p><p>\"It's my oath to take care of these animals,\" he said.</p><p>A California law backed by the Humane Society is prompting change. Proposition 12 requires breeding pigs to be able to lie down and turn around in spaces in which they are housed, essentially outlawing pork produced using small gestation stalls in most circumstances. Under the measure, Mr. Paustian's pigs couldn't go to market in the nation's most populous state.</p><p>Supermarkets and restaurants found in violation could be punished with fines of up to $1,000 or as many as 180 days in jail. A recent order by a California state judge delayed the application of the law on California retailers until six months after state officials draft regulations, which aren't currently in place. California's law has been met with opposition from the meat industry, groceries and other food retailers since it was passed by voters in 2018.</p><p>The National Pork Producers Council, a Washington lobbying group, filed suit in 2020 in federal appeals court in San Francisco saying California can't regulate how pigs in other states are bred. The Supreme Court is weighing whether to hear the case.</p><p>As advocates and investors ratchet up attention on the issue, hog farmers said they face a choice of whether to spend millions of dollars changing their operations. Only about 7% of U.S. sow housing meets California's Proposition 12 standards, according to lender Rabobank.</p><p>Getting rid of gestation stalls can make hog farmers less efficient, said Stewart Leeth, chief sustainability officer for Smithfield Foods. Farmers would have to house fewer hogs in their barns to comply with larger square-footage requirements, he said.</p><p>Niman Ranch, a pork supplier that doesn't use gestation stalls, said it can be done without hurting productivity. Chris Oliviero, general manager at Niman, a unit of Perdue Farms Inc., said there has been ample time since companies began pledging to phase out pork raised in stalls a decade ago and the Proposition 12 vote to comply with new breeding rules.</p><p>\"I think the industry needs to get behind it,\" Mr. Oliviero said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
