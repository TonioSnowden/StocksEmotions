  "text": "<p>St. Johns, Mich.</p><p>I'm 5 feet 11 inches tall, weigh 200 pounds and I set the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. But my body temperature is 36 degrees Celsius, I drive 100 kilometers an hour on the highway and C$1.25 for a liter of gas is a good deal here in Canada. My favorite deli order is 200 grams of Black Forest ham, but at McDonald's it's a Quarter Pounder. The weirdest one to me—and I may be alone on this—is that I measure temperature outside in Celsius but inside in Fahrenheit: \"It's going down to 10 degrees tonight. Better turn the heat up to 73.\"</p><p>If Canada is metric-ish, the U.S. is imperial-ish. Drugs are bought in grams and kilos, and the most common bullet is the 9 millimeter. In Canada, it's the 30-ought-6 rifle shell, which is 0.3 of an inch in diameter. Whatever the measure, the size is the same.</p><p>Whether in metric or imperial, let's agree that Prof. Block's connection between measurements, government control and a 45-year slow play by Canada to get the U.S. to convert to the metric system can only be measured as a stretch.</p><p>Matt Roncadin</p><p>Stouffville, Ontario</p><p>America Resisted the Metric System—or Did It?</p>",
