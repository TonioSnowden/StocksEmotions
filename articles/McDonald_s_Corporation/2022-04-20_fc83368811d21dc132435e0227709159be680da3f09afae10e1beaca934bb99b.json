  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis: 'Internet Army' Pressures Western Firms to Quit Russia",
  "text": "<p>It wasn't an isolated tweet. The post was part of a social-media pressure campaign coordinated by Ukraine's Ministry of Digital Transformation. The ministry has organized what it calls its Internet Army: a group of volunteers who are helping Ukraine fight the cyber and information war, including many social-media volunteers who post messages singling out Western companies doing business in Russia, said Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of Digital Transformation.</p><p>About 300,000 volunteers have joined the effort, and their social-media posts are reaching some 100 million global users daily, Mr. Fedorov said in an interview. In recent days, the group has turned its attention to foreign government officials, asking them to supply Ukraine with heavy weapons, he said.</p><p>The ministry has given volunteers instructions to put pressure on several dozen major Western companies and has provided sample language for social-media posts through a channel on the chat app Telegram, according to a Wall Street Journal review of the Telegram channel.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson announced on March 29 it had suspended sales of its personal-care products in Russia, but said it would continue to sell medicine and medical devices there. The company had no further comment.</p><p>Another company targeted by the ministry, McDonald's Corp., said last month it would temporarily close its locations in Russia. Many other companies that have been the focus of the efforts have suspended or paused operations in Russia since its invasion of Ukraine began. The reasons they have given for the pullbacks range from the difficulty of doing business amid sanctions to concerns about safety of staff.</p><p>None of the companies on the receiving end of volunteers' posts have cited the social-media pressure as a factor behind their decision.</p><p>French supermarket giant Auchan Retail International SA, which has stores in many European countries, was a recent target of the Internet Army.</p><p>\"One of the most consistent and intransigent companies that refuses to leave russia is @AUCHAN_France. On the weekend, I urge you to go to the nearest Auchan store in your city and picket it up. If you cannot do so, please refrain from shopping there,\" tweeted Kyiv-based Twitter user Artem Stelmashov on April 9.</p><p>An Auchan spokesman declined to comment. Auchan has previously told The Wall Street Journal that the company opposes the war in Ukraine but sees it as Auchan's job to provide food for Russia's population.</p><p>Other companies the volunteers posted about said they had good reason for continuing some operations in Russia, including to supply essential products or medicines and continue charitable work.</p><p>British oil giant Shell PLC said March 8 that it would withdraw from its involvement in Russian oil and natural gas, citing humanitarian reasons. A Shell spokesman said the social-media posts hadn't influenced its actions.</p><p>The Internet Army sometimes tags influential people in posts, hoping to enlist them to advance Ukraine's cause.</p><p>The campaign isn't the only effort to harness the power of social media to shame companies into severing ties with Russia. Boycott Russia, founded by U.K.-based advisory firm Highgate, is one of several activist groups following a similar playbook. Others include UA Telegram Army, Squeezing Putin and Exit Russia.</p><p>\"Cutting all ties with Russia and cutting off all funding is the only way to help stop the atrocious war Russia launched against the Ukrainian people,\" said Valeriya Melnichuk, a vice president at Highgate and one of Boycott Russia's founders. Ms. Melnichuk is a Ukrainian living in London.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
