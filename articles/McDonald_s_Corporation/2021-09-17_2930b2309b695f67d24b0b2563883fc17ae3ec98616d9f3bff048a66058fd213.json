  "text": "<p><em>The writer is the FT's restaurant critic</em></p> <p>It started a few years ago, talking to a couple of food journalists online. “Are you getting a load of PR contact around lab-grown meat?” We definitely had, but had we&#xa0;actually seen any of the stuff? Tasted it? Nope. Promising samples were mentioned, in a locked-down lab somewhere, but no, “at this time” we couldn't actually see it.</p> <p>This was all very strange. When you write about food, you're used to cheery PRs wanting you to sample a bit of artisanal gin, to be nice about a restaurant, to think about&#xa0;what sort of biscuits you'll be recommending at Christmas. Usually, there's something to taste, a package to look at. It's about a product that actually exists. But this was&#xa0;different; big international PR firms wanting us to excite our readers about something that hadn't actually happened yet.</p> <p>Since the beginning of the 20th century, there have been plenty of patents on food and drink. J Harvey Kellogg was in constant battle with other producers of rival breakfast cereals,&#xa0; Coca-Cola waxed fat on a ‘secret recipe' for its delicious carbonated beverage, McDonald's devised and defended the Big Mac, but these were single&#xa0;products, discretionary purchases.&#xa0;</p> <p>Other sectors worked their Intellectual Property even harder. You can agree or disagree with the patenting of life saving drugs or vaccines. You can aver that patents fund the&#xa0;research, or you can protest that the funding should be public and the results freely available in the public domain. Either way, you can't deny that ‘Big Pharma' is big&#xa0;because of IP. You can believe that a patented combination of sterile genetically modified plants, fertiliser and pesticides is going to be a vital part of feeding the world but you can't&#xa0;deny that the agrochemical heavyweights are so vast because of their IP.</p> <p>Currently, there's not a lot of IP in the meat industry. Some selective breeding perhaps, but nobody owns the patent on a Friesian. Meat is big business — huge and arguably&#xa0;damaging to the planet — but not monolithic. There are millions of people worldwide, breeding, caring for animals, slaughtering and processing them, transporting,&#xa0;butchering and retailing meat, they just don't work for the same company and most importantly, they're dealing with ‘meat' . . . not ‘Meat (TM)'.</p> <p>This is why the companies currently promoting lab-grown meat as part of a more sustainable future are not, at present, too worried about retailing their product.&#xa0;They'd like the public to become intrigued by the idea . . . maybe to think of it as something that's important to the future of the planet, but let's not kid ourselves that sustainability is the main driver here. The&#xa0;first company to produce and patent a workable lab-grown ‘beef' patty or ‘chicken' nugget will immediately sell it to fast food operations and simply take a little boost every&#xa0;time a till bleeps in your home town.</p> <p>Saving animal lives, preventing the clear-cutting of rainforest, even the reduction of methane farts don't excite investors — those changes can't translate to profit. The&#xa0;holy grail is replacing the meat we consume with a proprietary product, owning the IP on meat. Coca-Cola and McDonald's managed to grow patented food products&#xa0;into two of the top food companies on the globe by market cap, but a patent on animal-free ‘meat' could entirely dwarf their achievements.</p> <p>And the expensive PR push, the not-so-gentle steering of the discourse towards part-time veganism as a lifestyle statement, a non-specific promoter of ‘wellbeing',&#xa0;rather than anything to do with morals, ethics, politics or animal welfare? That is about preparing the vast market for the miracle ‘meats' when they eventually arrive.&#xa0;</p> <p>Please don't get me wrong. I fully applaud anyone who wants to be vegan,&#xa0;vegetarian, to cut down on their meat intake or move towards a plant-based diet. For&#xa0;the record, I eat decently reared, sustainable meat,&#xa0;and much less of it than I used to. I believe most of the current discussion about the place of meat in our diet is&#xa0;intelligent, measured and good for us all — but I'm not naive enough to believe that lab-grown meat plays any part of that story.&#xa0;</p> <p>Go ahead, give up meat and eat plants, but&#xa0;the lab-grown product is all about replacing an addiction to meat with something that's just easier to patent.&#xa0;‘Meathadone', if you will. Just think for a second about&#xa0;the business imperative here. Once food companies can “manufacture meat”, they won't want you to eat less of it, quite the contrary.</p> <p>Ultimately, lab grown meat — alongside the fish, milk, and eggs currently being prototyped — is not about sustainability, it's not about saving the planet, it's not really even&#xa0;about food. It's about IP. The prize of vat-grown protein has the potential to create something even more financially significant than Coke or McDonald's and every one&#xa0;of us, every vegan, every steak lover, health freak and foodie alike, should understand that.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/c229cb29-8a7a-4b2a-ac56-cecb12aa2ea0.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Tim Hayward 2021 'Lab-grown meat isn't about sustainability, it's big business' FT.com 17 September.
