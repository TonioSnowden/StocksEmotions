  "text": "<p>But after howls from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, NLRB Inspector General David Berry launched an investigation into then-Member Bill Emanuel and declared him too \"conflicted\" to have taken part. The NLRB vacated Hy-Brand, and then spent nearly two years rewriting a formal joint-employer rule. That rule clarified that a company is responsible for a contractor's employees only if it exercises direct and immediate control over work conditions. Unions hate this standard, and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) has sued to overturn the NLRB rule.</p><p>Now the conflict of interest is on the other foot. Two Biden appointees to the NLRB—Gwynne Wilcox and David Prouty—have worked for the SEIU. GOP Members of Congress led by Indiana Sen. Mike Braun have written to NLRB Chair Lauren McFerran demanding that both Biden appointees recuse themselves from litigation or issues regarding the joint-employer rule.</p><p>Mr. Berry's sweeping Trump-era ethics interpretation against Mr. Emanuel was unprecedented and unnecessary under federal guidelines. Ethics rules require appointees to step back from issues in which they've had direct or substantial involvement, but Ms. Warren insisted that Mr. Emanuel recuse from any case involving any client of his former employer. Mr. Emanuel never represented Hy-Brand, but the Warren-Berry recusal standard nonetheless became the NLRB standard.</p><p>But where are Ms. Warren and Mr. Berry now? Prior to his confirmation in July, Mr. Prouty was general counsel for SEIU Local 32BJ, one of the largest property-service labor unions in the U.S. He signed SEIU Local 32BJ's comments opposing the Trump joint-employer rule. This is disqualifying by any ethics standard.</p><p>Ms. Wilcox was associate general counsel of 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East and was also a partner at the union law firm, Levy Ratner. She represented \"Fight for $15,\" a group that sued McDonald's in a joint-employer liability case that may be headed to the NLRB along with other SEIU suits that have Ms. Wilcox's fingerprints on them.</p><p>The two Biden appointees suggest they must recuse only from cases involving their union local. But SEIU International exerts significant control over locals on membership, strikes, lockouts and union dues. The conflict of interest is far more direct and problematic than Sen. Warren's standard of near-total recusal for any Republican who ever worked in labor law.</p><p>The letter from Sen. Braun and colleagues reminded the NLRB of guidance from the Office of Government Ethics that asks if an \"employee's impartiality would reasonably be questioned\" if they were to participate in a \"particular matter involving specific parties.\" It strains credulity that Ms. Wilcox or Mr. Prouty could rule impartially on a joint-employer standard that they and their former union employers fought for years.</p><p>A single standard should apply to NLRB appointees of either party, which means the two Democrats have no business participating in joint-employer cases.</p><p>Ethics Shenanigans at the Labor Board</p>",
