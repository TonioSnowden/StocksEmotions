  "text": "<p>The complaint says the sweater's tags claimed it was knit from \"fine luxurious yarns crafted from Pima Cotton fibers\" that provide \"lightweight comfort and an exquisitely soft hand.\" But \"the average length of Pima cotton fibers is 1.3125 inches,\" and Ms. Miramontes learned her sweater's fibers were a few tenths of an inch too short. Now the class-action lawyers at Sheehan &amp; Associates in New York and Aaronson Law Firm in Texas want to cash in on the tenths of an inch.</p><p>They claim the company \"took advantage of consumers' cognitive shortcuts made at the point of sale\" and engaged in \"negligent misrepresentation\" and \"unjust enrichment.\" They note the sweater was sold in \"thousands of locations\" and claim \"the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds $5 million.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, plaintiff Justin Chimienti is suing Wendy's and McDonald's in a class action filed last month in federal court in the eastern district of New York. \"In general, meat shrinks 25% when cooked, depending upon the amount of fat and liquid contained in the meat,\" the suit says. \"McDonald's only sears the outside of the patty it uses for its advertisements, but it does not fully cook the patty so to deceive customers.\" He claims Wendy's does the same, and he's aghast that the burgers from the drive-thru don't look like those on TV.</p><p>Salivating are the plaintiff attorneys James Kelly, Anthony Russo and Mark Anthony Panzavecchia. They claim the ads \"are unfair and financially damaging consumers,\" which is \"especially concerning now that inflation, food, and meat prices are very high.\" Mr. Chimienti brings this claim \"on his own behalf and on behalf of all other persons or entities who purchased an Overstated Wendy's Menu Item or an Overstated McDonald's Menu Item based on false representations,\" the complaint says.</p><p>Ralph Lauren declined to comment, and Wendy's and McDonald's didn't respond to inquiries. But if these turn out like most class actions, the defendants will settle, the plaintiffs will receive token compensation, and the lawyers will make out like bandits.</p><p>Greatest Class-Action Lawsuit Hits</p>",
