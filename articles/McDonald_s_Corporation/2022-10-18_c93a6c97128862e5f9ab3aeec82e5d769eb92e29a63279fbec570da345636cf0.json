  "title": "War Drives a Rift Between Two Ukrainian Brothers; Millions of Ukrainians have relatives in Russia. Now, clashing experiences of the war—fueled by Russian propaganda—have led many to become estranged.",
  "text": "<p>Father Iosif called and asked how he knew it was the Russians, not the Ukrainians, who were responsible.</p><p>\"This is just what war is like,\" he said.</p><p>Vasyl hung up and began crying. He didn't speak with his brother for the following two months.</p><p>The friction between the brothers—who were born in western Ukraine and grew up speaking Ukrainian—is a microcosm of rifts affecting many Ukrainian and Russian families. For 59-year-old Iosif, who moved to Russia in 1989, the conflict is a just war to take back historically Russian lands. For the younger Vasyl, who stayed in Ukraine, it is a barbaric crime propped up by the Kremlin's lies. </p><p>The windows at Father Vasyl's church, the Temple of the Holy Myrrh Bearing Women in Kharkiv, Ukraine, were damaged during a missile attack.

Many of those Ukrainians live in cities that have been targeted by Russian missiles and are the scene of atrocities by Russian soldiers.</p><p>But in Russia, TV propaganda backed by officials and the powerful Orthodox Church has convinced many that the invasion is a mission to prise Ukraine from the West's grasp and liberate its Russian-speaking population.</p><p>The two parallel realities have helped create a gulf between siblings, between parents and children, and between husbands and wives.</p><p>\"There's so much information out there about what Russia's army is doing and how much pain it has caused Ukraine, and still Russians deny this,\" said Russian film director Andrei Loshak. \"Putin's propaganda fuels a thirst for revanchism. He could have avoided pressing those buttons—but he did, and very successfully.\"</p><p>Mr. Loshak's 2022 film \"Broken Ties,\" which profiles Ukrainians and Russians estranged from Russia-based relatives, has been viewed more than 1.8 million times on YouTube. Mr. Loshak, who left Moscow for Tbilisi, Georgia, one week into the war, has himself drifted apart from a cousin whom he spent his childhood with and who now backs the war. </p><p>The Assumption Cathedral in the territory of the Holy Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra in Sergiyev-Posad near Moscow, the spiritual center of the Russian Orthodox Church.

He calls himself Russian and praises the new churches built under President Vladimir Putin's rule as evidence that Russia holds the moral high ground.</p><p>\"The chaos that is happening in Ukraine is God's retribution,\" he says. \"They are trying to purge part of their population, and constantly place our country in the crosshairs.\" He says deaths of Ukrainian civilians are a regrettable side effect of Russian attacks on military objects, and believes Vasyl isn't getting the full picture.</p><p>Many of his own views—about a fascist government in Kyiv waging \"genocide\" against inhabitants of eastern Ukraine—reflect the narrative promoted on Russian state TV, which he consumes alongside Ukrainian news sources.</p><p>Vasyl says he finds it hard to understand why Iosif denies Russian aggression when he has seen the footage of Kharkiv's destruction that Vasyl sends him over WhatsApp. Moreover, two of Iosif's sons lost jobs as managers at McDonald's after the U.S. fast-food chain withdrew from Russia, though they were later reinstated when it reopened under a different name.</p><p>\"I tell him: You have a smartphone, you have Telegram, you have alternative sources of information,\" Vasyl said. He and his siblings describe Iosif as a kind father and community member, who has welcomed refugees from eastern Ukraine into his church.</p><p>But for Iosif, the grim footage sent by his brother has become too much to bear. \"I don't always look at it, if I'm honest,\" he said. \"Sometimes it's just too difficult.\" He said he prays for his brother and for the war to end, but believes it was the inevitable result of Ukraine's actions.</p><p>On May 29, Vasyl's birthday, Iosif called for the first time since the attack on Vasyl's church. He listened silently for around 20 minutes, and when Vasyl asked about his children, Iosif sighed and said they were out of work. \"After three months of war he began to understand just a little about what is really happening,\" Vasyl said.</p><p>Later, when Russia conducted sham referendums in occupied parts of Ukraine last month and declared almost unanimous supportthere for annexation by Russia, Iosif said Russia had to respect the wishes of local residents. </p><p>Father Vasyl at his church. He didn't speak with his brother Iosif for two months because of disagreements over the war.

Vasyl backed the decision by the Ukrainian branch of the Russian Orthodox Church to sever ties with Moscow.

They lost their older brother Bohdan, a priest who died of a brain hemorrhage not long after being forced to flee his home north of Kharkiv when his town came under Russian occupation.</p><p>Their sister Maria Yablokova, who works as a nurse in Estonia and aids Ukrainian refugees, urged Vasyl to stop speaking with Iosif. \"I didn't want arguments,\" she said in a phone interview.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Will the people of Ukraine and Russia eventually be able to mend relations? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In May, the Ukrainian branch of the Russian Orthodox Church, that both Vasyl and Iosif's parishes belong to, severed ties with Moscow. Vasyl backed the decision, writing in a letter to the head priest of the Kharkiv region that the war had left many of his parishioners without homes and exacted a huge toll on their lives.</p><p>By then, Vasyl had repaired his church and resumed services. With help from local residents, some of whom took shelter in the church's basement during the March attack, he boarded up the windows, cleaned up the debris and replaced doors that had been thrown off their hinges by the blast.</p><p>A 30-year-old parishioner who helped with the cleanup effort was walking in a park in late May when the blast wave from another Russian missile strike tore his five-month-old child from his hands, killing both instantly. Vasyl presided over his funeral. </p><p>Sunday service at Father Iosif's church near Moscow. Iosif says he would like to see his brother in Kharkiv.

But he wishes he could return to the Ukraine he lived in during Soviet times, when, he says, life was better.</p><p>\"I understand my brother, and I hope I have his understanding,\" he said. \"I just want our relations to remain as they once were.\"</p><p>Vasyl said he would struggle to forgive Russians for the pain they have caused.</p><p>\"It's my duty to forgive, as a priest and a Christian. But I don't know,\" he said. \"I can't force my heart to do it. There's such a wound here, such enormous pain.\"</p><p>Write to Matthew Luxmoore at Matthew.Luxmoore@wsj.com</p><p>War Drives a Rift Between Two Ukrainian Brothers</p>",
