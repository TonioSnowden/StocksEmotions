  "title": "Rapper Pusha T Disses McDonald's in New Arby's Ad; Artist, who says he was underpaid for involvement in writing of 'I'm Lovin It' jingle nearly two decades ago, teams up with Arby's in 75-second rap video",
  "text": "<p>The rapper, whose name is Terrence Thornton, teamed up with Arby's to make a 75-second rap video touting its new spicy fish sandwich, while also taking a shot at McDonald's.</p><p>\"I'm the reason the whole world love it, now I gotta crush it,\" Pusha T raps on the ad. \"How dare you sell a square fish, asking us to trust it. A half slice of cheese, Mickey D's on a budget?\"</p><p>McDonald's didn't respond to a request for comment. Pusha T declined to comment.</p><p>The video also shows a boat with the Arby's logo dipping through waves in the ocean and images of a clown running with bags of money.</p><p>\"Say less, this argument is baseless. Drowned in tartar, that Filet-o-Fish is tasteless,\" Pusha T raps. \"Arby's only deals in greatness. I bet the house on it like it's Vegas.\"</p><p>Pusha T added the hashtag #ArbysPaidMeButIWouldSayThisAnyway to his social-media posts sharing the song. As of Tuesday afternoon, the video had more than 4.7 million views on his Twitter account.</p><p>Arby's tapped creative agency Fallon to promote its fish sandwich, and the agency came up with the idea of a diss track—or a song that takes shots at another person or brand, said Patrick Schwing, chief marketing officer for Arby's.</p><p>\"Who better to do a diss track than Pusha T, who is well known in the hip-hop landscape for doing that,\" Mr. Schwing said.</p><p>The track was recorded two years ago but Arby's decided to put the release on hold because it was finished at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the company thought it didn't strike the right tenor at the time, Mr. Schwing said.</p><p>He said Pusha T was selected for the ad because of his skills and confidence as a performer and not because of his prior history with McDonald's.</p><p>He said Pusha T also wrote the lyrics to the song and wasn't fed lines. \"That's him doing his thing,\" Mr. Schwing said.</p><p>Arby's, owned by Inspire Brands Inc., declined to say how much Pusha T was paid for the ad.</p><p>In the Rolling Stone interview, the rapper said he's been irked for years about the amount of money that McDonald's paid him for his work on the jingle, and this Arby's video allowed him to get some of the frustration off his chest.</p><p>However, there has been a dispute about Pusha T's role in writing the McDonald's jingle. A German music house has claimed it created the jingle for the advertising agency that worked on the ad and said Pusha T had no role in it.</p><p>\"I am solely responsible for the 'I'm Lovin' It' swag and the jingle of that company,\" Pusha T told Rolling Stone. In 2016, he tweeted: \"Luckily no one tried to clown me for my McD's jingle…I woulda had to dig up pay stubs, I think u social media guys call that \"metrics.\"</p><p>Pusha T got his start rapping with his brother, Gene Thornton, then known as Malice, in the hip-hop duo Clipse. Their first album \"Lord Willin'\" was released in 2002 and went gold, selling at least 500,000 units.</p><p>The rapper later went on to launch a successful solo career and has worked with artists such as Kanye West, Jay-Z, Pharrell Williams and Alicia Keys.</p><p>Pusha T has a new album in the works but hasn't set a release date yet, according to his spokesperson.</p><p>Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com</p><p>Rapper Pusha T Disses McDonald's in New Arby's Ad</p>",
