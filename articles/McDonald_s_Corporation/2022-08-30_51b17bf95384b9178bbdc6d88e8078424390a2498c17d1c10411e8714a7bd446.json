  "title": "U.S. News:  California  Legislature  Approves  Fast-Food  Wages Bill  ----  By Heather Haddon and Christine Mai-Duc",
  "text": "<p>   California's legislature passed a bill Monday to create a government panel that would set wages for an estimated half-million fast-food workers in the state, a first-in-the-U.S. approach to workplace regulation that labor union backers hope will spread nationally.+ </p><p>   The bill, known as the Fast Act, would establish a panel with members appointed by the governor and legislative leaders composed of workers, union representatives, employers and business advocates. They would set hourly wages of up to $22 for fast-food workers starting next year and could increase them annually by the same rate as the consumer-price index, up to a maximum of 3.5%. </p><p>   A previous version of the bill passed by the state Assembly in January also allowed the council to oversee workplace conditions such as scheduling and made restaurant chains joint employers of their franchise's employers, potentially opening them to liability for labor violations. </p><p>   Representatives for companies including McDonald's Corp., Yum Brands Inc. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. succeeded in having those provisions removed in the state Senate via amendments over the past week, though they still oppose the bill. </p><p>   \"This is the biggest lobbying fight that the franchise sector has ever been in,\" said Matthew Haller, president of the International Franchise Association, a trade group whose members own many fast-food restaurants. </p><p>   A University of California, Riverside School of Business study commissioned by the franchisee association found that setting minimum wages between $22 and $43 would generate a 60% increase in labor costs and raise fast-food prices by about 20%. </p><p>   California's current minimum wage is $15 and is set to increase by 50 cents on Jan. 1. </p><p>   The final version of the Fast Act passed both houses of the Democratic-controlled state legislature Monday. In both the Assembly and the Senate, all of the \"yes\" votes came from Democrats and every Republican who voted opposed the bill. </p><p>   Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom now has until Sept. 30 to decide whether to sign or veto the bill. </p><p>   Mr. Newsom hasn't taken a public stance on the current version of the bill, but his Department of Finance opposed the original version. </p><p>   Labor unions backing the measure have long struggled to organize fast-food workers, in part because the industry's franchise model means there are so many different employers. </p><p>   California lawmakers first floated the bill last year, with proponents arguing that tighter regulations were needed to protect fast-food workers, who are overwhelmingly Black or Latino and who they say experience unpaid overtime and other labor violations. </p><p>   Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry said she hoped the bill would be a catalyst for similar movements across the country. </p><p>   Investors have begun to ask about the legislation's potential implications for restaurant chains at a time when companies are struggling with high food and labor costs, Wall Street analysts said. </p><p>   \"Obviously, we think it's problematic on many, many fronts,\" said Paul Brown, chief executive of Dunkin' and Arby's owner Inspire Brands Inc., in an interview. \"I think it's actually trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist.\" </p><p></p>",
