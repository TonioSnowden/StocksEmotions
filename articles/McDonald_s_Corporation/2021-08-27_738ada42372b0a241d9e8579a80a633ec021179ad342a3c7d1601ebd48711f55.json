  "title": "The Meme Lords Who Are Taking Over the C-Suite; These company insiders—from GameStop's Ryan Cohen to AMC's Adam Aron—post outlandish tweets and have cult-like followings online",
  "text": "<p>One thing was clear: A meme lord now occupied the boardroom.</p><p>Mr. Cohen, who became GameStop's chairman in June, is one of several company insiders who now use cryptic tweets or memes that drum up interest in their companies or generate cult-like followings online in forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets. They include Tesla Inc.'s Elon Musk and AMC Entertainment Inc.'s Adam Aron, who are now known, respectively, in the online communities as \"Daddy Elon\" and \"The Silverback.\" Mr. Cohen goes by \"Papa Cohen.\"</p><p>Their social-media strategies are risky but can be effective: GameStop's share price remains up almost 1,000% for the year. Tesla, too, even while its stock is nearly flat in 2021, still has a market capitalization of roughly $700 billion—more than five times the market cap of General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co. combined. AMC, meanwhile, watched its stock soar roughly 1,800% year-to-date, helping the movie-theater chain stave off bankruptcy.</p><p>Just 10 years ago, it's hard to imagine that any executive would want to be labeled a meme lord. Corporate America has always relished having larger-than-life leaders, such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s Warren Buffett and General Electric Co.'s Jack Welch. Yet even the most dynamic ones have long struggled to make any meaningful connections online, preferring to leave a carefully curated social-media image to online marketing teams. Historical precedent—including tangles with financial regulators—made, for some executives, the case for laying low.</p><p>Analysts, social-media experts and retail traders say that executing an effective meme strategy online isn't easy—and the randomness and fast-changing attitudes of the internet, as well as an ever-growing base of retail traders, mean that some tactics don't always land. Many corporate leaders have tried to be relatable on the internet, only to end up as the butt of the internet's many jokes. Others, such as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell—known as JPOW on Reddit—also have become the subject of memes online, despite doing little to court such attention.</p><p>\"There's a fine line that you as an executive have to walk,\" said Christina Sautter, a law professor at Louisiana State University's Paul M. Hebert Law Center, who studies the intersection between corporate governance and retail investors.</p><p>'Papa Cohen'</p><p>Mr. Cohen's ice cream-and-frog post wasn't the first or last cryptic tweet from the GameStop investor who now owns roughly 12% of the company's shares. Previously, Mr. Cohen was in charge of pet-supply retailer Chewy Inc., the company he co-founded, before selling it for more than $3 billion in 2017.</p><p>In the months since he joined GameStop's board, Mr. Cohen tweeted a photo of a tombstone bearing the words, \"RYAN COHEN R.I.P DUMB ASS,\" and posted a picture of himself with chopsticks up his nose. They garnered thousands of likes and retweets and inspired countless discussions across the internet—and created ardent followings in real life.</p><p>His Feb. 24 ice cream-and-frog tweet enthralled amateur traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum. One trader guessed that Mr. Cohen had signaled he wanted shares to leap like a frog. Another surmised that Mr. Cohen would fix GameStop just as McDonald's tried to fix its troubled ice cream machines. Others predicted the ice cream itself hinted at a big announcement. \"Ryan Cohen's tweet = Big news coming this Sundae?\" one Reddit user wrote.</p><p>A spokesman for Mr. Cohen declined to comment.</p><p>Some followers are so loyal that earlier this year they traveled to Grapevine, Texas, for GameStop's annual shareholders meeting to hear Mr. Cohen, who appeared virtually, speak.</p><p>One was Justin Gnant, a 36-year-old individual trader who holds roughly 1,100 GameStop shares and traveled from his home from the Dallas area. He started buying last fall, picking up more shares along the way, on a belief that Mr. Cohen can transform GameStop. He frequently follows what Mr. Cohen has to say online.</p><p>\"Every now and then, he makes me wonder if he posts a tweet that actually has no meaning,\" Mr. Gnant said. \"And then you just kind of comb through the Reddit conspiracies and tin-foil-hat posts to see if any good ideas float up.\"</p><p>'The Silverback'</p><p>The boss of the world's largest movie-theater chain is a graduate of Harvard Business School who was well versed in communicating with Wall Street before he got to AMC in 2016. This year he learned how to speak to a new audience: the nonprofessional trader.</p><p>It began when AMC's stock soared thanks to a push from Reddit users. Mr. Aron started following scores of these investors to see what they were tweeting. He also shared memes that referred to Reddit jokes.</p><p>In May, he tweeted a meme of his head photoshopped onto promotional material for the movie \"The Godfather,\" though the title was replaced with \"The Apefather,\" an homage to everyday traders who call themselves apes. \"And the hilariously funny memes keep coming,\" he tweeted alongside the picture. He also tweeted a photo of the movie poster for \"Gorillas in the Mist\" with his face replacing Sigourney Weaver's.</p><p>\"They don't want to be interacting with, I think you might say, a dry, boring suit talking corporate speak,\" Mr. Aron said in an interview. Sometimes on Twitter, he said, \"I'm explaining real corporate news that's going on...other times we're just laughing and smiling and winking a little bit.\"</p><p>On a recent earnings call, Mr. Aron took questions from nearly a dozen everyday investors. He also has joined one individual investor for interviews on his YouTube channel and said on Twitter that he donated to a charity that individual investors on Reddit supported.</p><p>\"We've taken this very seriously,\" Mr. Aron said in the interview. \"We decided…we need to be in active dialogue with our new owners. How should we do that? The obvious first thing was go on Twitter because that's where they are.\"</p><p>'Daddy Elon'</p><p>Few have better demonstrated how taking some risk on social media can pay off than Mr. Musk, the billionaire who runs electric car maker Tesla. He frequently posts nonsensical memes and hurls insults at critics, while his tweets on everything from Tesla to bitcoin to GameStop often become market-moving events.</p><p>Yet Mr. Musk's Twitter habit hasn't been without controversy, including a 61-character tweet three years ago: \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\" Tesla's stock finished up 11% on the day of the news before then falling for 15 of the next 20 trading days.</p><p>Even investors who were used to Mr. Musk's free-wheeling posts were whipsawed by the news. Mr. Musk and Tesla each paid a $20 million fine in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the tweet, and agreed the company would sign off on any written statements on Twitter by Musk that could be deemed material.</p><p>Securities regulators have since told Tesla that Mr. Musk's use of Twitter had twice violated that policy. Still, he keeps tweeting—with many of his recent tweets this year sending cryptocurrencies on a wild ride. When Mr. Musk added #bitcoin to his Twitter biography one January morning—around the same time as a cryptic tweet that said \"In retrospect, it was inevitable\"—the price of bitcoin soared, gaining nearly 15% within the first hour after the tweet was sent. Mr. Musk couldn't be reached for comment.</p><p>Matthew Holcomb, a 46-year-old California trader, said he scooped up bitcoin and the altcoin SafeMoon this spring, anticipating that both would keep rising after Mr. Musk's appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" in May. Instead, he was caught off guard when cryptocurrencies across the board severely tumbled. He estimates he put about $800—what he considered to be a small amount—in SafeMoon leading up to Mr. Musk's appearance. Today, his investment is worth about $90.</p><p>\"He's a once-in-a-lifetime enigmatic figure,\" said Mr. Holcomb. \"I blame myself for falling for the hype. But I think Elon Musk is ultimately responsible for basically cutting the [cryptocurrency] market in half\" at the time.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>The Meme Lords Who Are Taking Over the C-Suite</p>",
