  "text": "<p>A quiz question sent back to January 2020: <em>There is about to be a global pandemic. Flights will be grounded. The death toll will stretch into the millions. One of the countries imposing the strictest countermeasures will be China, which will shut its border for an extended period. At the same time, President Xi Jinping will withdraw from the west, crack down on the rich and insist on </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4dbbdade-15f1-4c6e-9220-738891d4c475\"><em>“common prosperity”</em></a><em>. Which companies will add the most value?</em></p> <p>Anyone putting LVMH in their top 20 would have been out of their mind — though correct.</p> <p>The FT's list of companies that “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8075a9c5-3c43-48a5-b507-5b8f5904f443\">prospered in the pandemic</a>” is dominated by Silicon Valley tech titans, with a relatively weak contribution from Europe. But the French luxury goods company weighs in at number 13 despite the dreadful backdrop — adding $184bn of equity value and ending 2021 as the 18th-biggest company in the world.</p> <p>The outperformance of the past two years has been followed by resilience in 2022's jittery markets. When the FAANGs fell, LVMH lost less. At €350bn, its market value is bigger than Shell and McDonald's combined.</p> <p>On Thursday evening, there was further evidence that this is not (only) a stock market bubble. LVMH reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ea64ea3-c44b-48a5-a2f7-39daa49d50b5\">full-year results</a> showing sales rose 44 per cent on lockdown-hit 2020 and a more impressive 20 per cent on 2019. Profits are doing even better.</p> <p>We have become accustomed to so much weirdness in the past two years that it is worth underlining: the current luxury boom is not normal.</p> <p>After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the rich stopped spending: it seemed gauche to buy Gucci. After the 2008 financial crisis, luxury spending was again put on hold.</p> <p>Not so today. Champagne volumes were up against 2019, LVMH reported, as were cognac and high-end rosé wines. The Roaring Twenties are indeed back, though without the flappers — the only LVMH category to fall on 2019 was cosmetics and perfume.</p> <p>The real staggering numbers came in LVMH's biggest division, fashion and leather goods, where sales were up 42 per cent on 2019, with Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior products flying. </p> <p>The Chinese who used to buy in Paris, Milan and Hong Kong have simply switched to their home market, shrugging off higher prices. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8963b1ee-9ffb-4f2e-8648-472e641716ba\">Xi's crackdown on billionaires</a> has not affected luxury demand among the middle classes.</p> <p>The Chinese market for luxury has doubled since 2019, according to an <a href=\"https://www.bain.com/about/media-center/press-releases/2021/luxury-report-2021/\">annual report</a> on the industry from Bain, and is set to overtake the Americas as the biggest region before 2025.</p> <p>Not every rival is booming as much as Bernard Arnault's group, which has a highly polished operation. From a call centre in Brussels, Louis Vuitton has polyglot staff who kept in touch with customers using WhatsApp and offering virtual tours. It meant the shuttered shops gave a misleading picture.</p> <p>“That's why we all underestimated the recovery,” says Antoine Belge, analyst at BNP Paribas Exane. “The stores were closed but they were still selling.”</p> <p>It cannot last for ever. LVMH trades at about 30 times future earnings, a rather big bet that the growth will endure. When the broader stock market turns, American retail investors will rein in their luxury purchases. One false step in China — a culturally insensitive advertising campaign, for instance — and LVMH could be blacklisted. But for now, forget all that: pass the&#xa0;Moët.</p><p>Source: Tom Braithwaite 2022 'What did you do in the great pandemic? Bought handbags' FT.com 27 January.
