  "title": "The Case for Plain Vanilla Gets Its Day in Court --- 'Natural flavor' may taste the same, but plaintiffs say it isn't made of real beans",
  "text": "<p>Now a battle over vanilla is playing out in federal courts across the U.S., with more than 100 proposed class-action cases filed over vanilla flavoring, many by Mr. Sheehan, within the past two years. At issue is one question: Is vanilla really vanilla without vanilla beans?</p><p>On one side are plaintiffs' lawyers, like Mr. Sheehan, who argue in lawsuits that food manufacturers are duping consumers by implying products are made with vanilla when they contain at most a trace of the plant. On the other are companies -- McDonald's Corp., Wegmans Food Markets Inc., Trader Joe's and Chobani LLC among them -- that argue consumers don't expect to find real vanilla in their vanilla soy milk or vanilla Greek yogurt as long as it tastes like vanilla.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. said the suit's claims have no merit and its products are truthfully marketed and labeled. The suit is ongoing.</p><p>McDonald's said its soft serve doesn't include artificial flavors, colors or preservatives.</p><p>Spokespeople for Wegmans and Trader Joe's didn't respond to requests for comment. Chobani declined to comment.</p><p>Legal experts say that while food lawsuits typically come in waves, the vanilla lawsuits are unusual for both their specificity and their sheer number.</p><p>Vanilla flavor historically came from beans found in the pods of a finicky tropical orchid, grown in countries including Madagascar, said Kantha Shelke, a food scientist who teaches at Johns Hopkins University. Due to high costs and fluctuating supply, many manufacturers now instead use \"natural flavor,\" a catchall term for flavoring that uses ingredients including those derived from plants. Natural vanilla flavors are often made from wood pulp or using fermentation technology, Dr. Shelke said.</p><p>Pure vanilla extract has ranged from $100 to $200 a gallon in the past year, according to Daphna Havkin-Frenkel, a vanilla expert who owns New Jersey-based Bakto Flavors LLC. The common alternative, known in the industry as \"natural vanilla flavor with other natural flavors,\" which largely doesn't come from vanilla beans, costs about $50 a gallon and is more concentrated, she said.</p><p>Mr. Sheehan compared real vanilla to a Chanel bag and its alternatives to knockoffs.</p><p>\"Just because you can't tell the difference between something real and something fake, that doesn't make it OK,\" he said.</p><p>Several months after Mr. Sheehan's A &amp; W suit, he filed another about cream soda. Then, plaintiffs' attorneys targeted companies producing much of the dairy aisle: vanilla yogurts, soy milks, almond milks, coffee creamers, ice creams with black specks masquerading as vanilla beans.</p><p>Most of the vanilla suits claimed manufacturers were violating federal labeling requirements, which they said allowed businesses to compete unfairly under state consumer-protection laws.</p><p>In one suit filed in California against McDonald's in September, a woman said she was deceived when she purchased vanilla cones that contained natural flavor. She had expected real vanilla, said her lawsuit, which was filed by Mr. Sheehan.</p><p>In court documents asking the judge to toss the case, McDonald's lawyers argued that vanilla is a flavor, much like Rocky Road or Tutti-frutti. The lawyers included roughly 50 comments on a Facebook post from Mr. Sheehan's firm as evidence that a reasonable consumer wouldn't expect real vanilla.</p><p>Under a photo of a perfectly twisted soft serve, the post from Mr. Sheehan's firm said: \"Does your Vanilla Soft Serve Ice Cream contain real vanilla? Not according to class-action lawsuits and investigations.\"</p><p>The commenters mostly mocked the post or groused about broken soft-serve machines.</p><p>\"Anyone else hear their root beer ain't got any beer in it either??\" one wrote. Another pointed out that Goldfish crackers aren't made with gold. \"No Duh!\" wrote a third.</p><p>In a court filing, the woman's lawyers, who include Mr. Sheehan, called the Rocky Road and Tutti-frutti comparison off-base, saying those are flavors, not ingredients, like vanilla.</p><p>Mr. Sheehan, who filed most of these cases, usually in conjunction with other firms, isn't new to food litigation. He has also sued a company that makes the sweet bread known as Hawaiian rolls outside of Hawaii and another that makes carrot-cake doughnuts without real carrots. The cases are pending.</p><p>They haven't been near the scale of those over vanilla.</p><p>Mr. Sheehan might be best known for representing \"Subway Vigilante\" Bernhard Goetz in a 2015 eviction matter over whether he allegedly kept a three-legged pet squirrel in his Manhattan apartment. Mr. Goetz wasn't evicted after the squirrel dispute.</p><p>Most of the vanilla suits are still working their way through the legal system. Judges have dismissed six cases, according to Robert Guite, a lawyer at Sheppard, Mullin, Richter &amp; Hampton LLP who represents clients sued over vanilla.</p><p>In August, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn declined to dismiss the A &amp; W lawsuit, saying a reasonable consumer would expect the drinks were made with vanilla.</p><p>Another case, alleging Califia Farms LLC improperly labeled its vanilla nondairy beverages, settled for approximately $3 million in payments to consumers last year. Califia denied its products were mislabeled but agreed to change some packaging.</p><p>Mr. Sheehan said his sweetest victory came outside of court. Last April, he sued Wegmans, arguing the grocery chain's gluten-free vanilla-cake mix is misleading because its ingredient list includes natural flavor but not vanilla.</p><p>While the suit is pending, Mr. Sheehan recently noticed a change to the box. Above a picture of frosted yellow cake are two additional words: \"Naturally flavored.\"</p>",
