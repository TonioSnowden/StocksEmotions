  "text": "<p>\n  Six Square Metres </p><p>\n  By Margaret Simons </p><p>\n  Scribe, 120 pages, $15 </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  If you're spatially challenged like I am, you scratch your head over figuring out \"six square\" of any measure. If you're American, the \"Six Square Metres\" of Margaret Simons's title may jam your circuits. And if you're any sort of gardener other than the most urban, contemplating a 6-square-meter garden (once you've figured it out: I mentally lay myself side by side several times) evokes profound sympathies. </p><p>\n  But from her brick-paved backyard about the size of one and a half king-sized beds, or two-fifths of a North American parking space, or not-quite-six bath towels spread out together at the pool, the Australian writer collects a flavorful harvest of food for thought and, even better, for supper. Ms. Simons, who directs the Centre for Advancing Journalism at the University of Melbourne, has written several books on Australian politics and media, as well as earlier books on gardening. Once she gardened in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales on a much larger scale, complete with a rooster called Vronsky and the laying hens she can't have in town. Now that she lives in the city, just over the fence from a fast-food parking lot, she turns her attention to what is possible there -- polystyrene roof boxes, rat baits and all. </p><p>\n  She is, she insists, \"not very good\" at gardening. She warns us that she is \"not an expert, and this is not a how-to book\"; she is offering some \"gardening-related reflections\" from her greenish-thumb career. She allocates a full square meter of her city garden to the compost bin, to which she annually returns an ancient Barbie leg that migrated once from a toy box, taking pleasure that \"some people's idea of perfect womanhood\" will be mixed with \"dirt, and worms, and the real stuff of fertility.\" She contemplates the vigor of pumpkins, with their slithery guts full of seeds, along with parsnips and \"all those other unglamorous, sweet, fart-producing root vegetables that were once like money in the bank: a bulwark against desperation.\" </p><p>\n  Impractically, I look for flowers: I'd rather fill a vase than eat. Ms. Simons has more people to feed than I do, though she shares my affection for lavender and, despite her protests, offers some useful tips for both gardener and writer: Lavender must be pruned with steadfast resolve, lest it become woody and leggy, the horticultural manifestation of prolix. She reminds us of other ramifications of hesitant gardening, recalling both Richard II and his caterpillars and the conundrum of cultivating one's garden, pace Candide, in an era of global warming. </p><p>\n  \"What about,\" Ms. Simons asks, \"all the things you didn't sow but that you end up reaping anyway?\" There are plenty of those, literal and figurative. When we're lucky, like her, we end up with the \"family shrubbery\" to whom she dedicates her book: children and grands and steps and family friends. Making the most of what's sown is for Ms. Simons, always a virtue. She cuts broccoli flowers for display before ruthlessly pulling the plants in preparation for the next season. Similarly, I buy Brussels sprouts on the stalk, tie them with a red ribbon and call them a centerpiece, till they end up roasted for dinner. </p><p>\n  You can't put a ribbon on everything: Ms. Simons reflects on \"the power of human urine, and the power of the passage of time,\" grieving for a friend who swore that peeing on a lemon tree works wonders for its bearing. Her own experience accommodates the idea; a former partner agreed to do the same for her ailing lemon, which became \"vigorous and prolific.\" </p><p>\n  Inspired (perhaps inordinately, though we seem to share both big ideas and personal disorganization), I've calculated that my apartment balcony is about five square meters. \"In place of vales and hills,\" Ms. Simons observes stoically, thinking of Wordsworth, \"I have the view of the McDonald's drive-through.\" She responds by planting daffodils, \"uniform, and bright as paint,\" in a red pot on her deck. I usually do serial inside indulgences with paper-white narcissus bulbs all winter, cramming them into big pots for home or smaller ones for giveaways. </p><p>\n  This spring, like Ms. Simons, I'm soaking moonflower seeds to grow up the balcony railings and some jerry-rigged pieces of string, and adding in scarlet runner beans to eat as well as look at. Rainbow chard (its Australian cousin has the lovely name \"silverbeet\") will be planted when I figure out the right timing. I'm tracking down the most lurid Alpine balcony geraniums, potting the hydroponic grocery-store herbs (such a deal), and concluding that I'll keep at least one comfortable chair out, to read books like this one. Compost bins are against the condo rules, anyway. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Ms. Jensen is a writer and editor in northern Virginia. Her gardening leaves something to be desired. </p><p></p>",
