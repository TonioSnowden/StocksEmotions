  "title": "Obituaries: Engineer Exposed Space Shuttle Risks",
  "text": "<p>(WSJ April 5, 2021)</p><p>(END)</p><p>ALLAN J. MCDONALD</p><p>1937-2021</p><p>You believe your superiors are trying to conceal an inconvenient truth. Do you blow the whistle? Or discreetly roll your eyes?</p><p>That was the dilemma faced by Allan J. McDonald in February 1986 when a presidential commission was investigating the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle, which killed all seven crew members a few weeks earlier.</p><p>Mr. McDonald was an engineer for the maker of the solid-fuel booster rockets. During a hearing, he believed an official of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was glossing over a prelaunch debate on whether to proceed despite unusually cold temperatures in Cape Canaveral, Fla.</p><p>Seated in the background, Mr. McDonald waved his hands for attention and then stood up. He told the commission that he and other engineers had warned that low temperatures might cause a failure of synthetic rubber O-ring seals in the rocket's joints. The commission later found that such a failure was responsible for the explosion and that NASA had brushed aside a warning that could have saved the astronauts.</p><p>The engineer, who died March 6 at age 83, was praised for speaking out but said he didn't feel like a hero. \"The only real heroes were the seven astronauts who went up in flames that day,\" he said later. One lesson, he said, was that bosses should encourage underlings to speak freely.</p><p>Mr. McDonald's uninvited testimony was a shock to the commission appointed by President Ronald Reagan. In his memoir, \"Truth, Lies and O-Rings,\" the engineer recalled the reaction from William P. Rogers, chairman of the commission:</p><p>\"Who in the hell are you?\"</p><p>Mr. McDonald introduced himself.</p><p>\"Would you please come down here and repeat what you've just said because if I just heard what I think I heard, then this may be in litigation for years to come,\" Mr. Rogers said. That proved to be an accurate forecast.</p><p>Mr. McDonald maintained that NASA officials, eager to go ahead with the launch, pressured his employer, Morton Thiokol Inc. -- a point some of those officials disputed.</p><p>Engineers who warned about the effect of cold weather on the seals were asked to prove that the situation could lead to a disaster, Mr. McDonald said in a 2011 lecture. \"They could not do that,\" he said, \"But that's not the same thing as saying it's safe to fly.\" Senior executives atMorton Thiokol, overruling their engineers, then gave NASA \"the answer it wanted,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Rogers thanked Mr. McDonald and other engineers for giving their side of the story. \"If their warnings had been heeded that day and the flight had been delayed, there's no telling what would have happened,\" he wrote later. \"We might never have had the accident.\"</p><p>At work, however, Mr. McDonald was at times ostracized by colleagues who accused him of undermining the company's aerospace business. Morton Thiokol moved him out of his space shuttle duties in what he considered a demotion.</p><p>When members of the commission and Congress learned that he had been sidelined, they protested what they saw as punishment for telling the truth. The company responded by putting him in charge of a program to redesign the rocket boosters and allow a resumption of the space shuttle program.</p><p>The commission's report agreed with Mr. McDonald's argument that NASA officials should have paid more heed to the engineers' warning. When the commission released its findings in June 1986, NASA administrator James Fletcher called the report \"a very good one.\"</p><p>Allan James McDonald, the youngest of four children, was born July 9, 1937, in Cody, Mont. His father, who had only a few years of formal education, was a grocer and served as a deputy county assessor. His mother had been a teacher.</p><p>After retiring in 2001, he gave lectures on business and engineering ethics. He said the courage he showed in speaking out wasn't unusual.</p><p>\"I never considered myself a hero for doing my job in the best manner that I knew how and telling the truth about it,\" he wrote, adding that \"there are legions of good people out there every day defending their professional opinions and willing to speak the truth at some risk to their own job security. They just haven't been involved in such a high-profile news making event like me.\"</p>",
