  "title": "Canada Issues Apology for Turning Blind Eye to Military's Sexualized Culture; Canada's government acknowledges it failed to heed warnings to fix military culture",
  "text": "<p>\"Things can change, they must change and they will change. It is our most basic responsibility, our most important task,\" Ms. Anand said at an event accompanied by top military leadership. \"I apologize to the thousands of Canadians who were harmed because your government did not protect you.\"</p><p>The apology from Ms. Anand and Gen. Wayne Eyre, Canada's newly appointed chief of defense staff, follows a series of sexual-misconduct allegations earlier this year that rocked the government and military and sparked by public outcry.</p><p>The allegations targeted top members of military leadership and have led to charges filed against at least two senior officers, including a former top soldier.</p><p>They prompted a parliamentary probe in March of the Liberal administration's role in overlooking warnings about sexual misconduct in the forces. Lawmakers heard from some current service members who said they were victims of assault and harassment but feared coming forward due to possible career repercussions.</p><p>\"To those who shouted, until you could shout no more, at great personal risk, only to have no one listen to you, we are sorry. To those who came forward and were told to be quiet and not rock the boat and to think of your career, we are sorry,\" Gen. Eyre said.</p><p>The uproar also undermined Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his high-profile pledge to defend women's rights and fight harassment in the workplace. The military allegations, combined with initial problems with the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, weighed on the prime minister's popularity in the spring before it rebounded ahead of a summer election call.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau said the apology is about recognizing the mistakes of the past. \"We need to remember, these are lives of people that were impacted, [and] destroyed, in some cases, by sexual assault to which the Canadian Armed Forces regularly turned a blind eye. That needs to change.\"</p><p>Before Mr. Trudeau came to power in 2015, a report to senior officials warned about a military culture rife with vulgar language referencing women's bodies, sexual jokes and innuendos and unwelcome touching. The report said this behavior was conducive to sexual harassment and assault.</p><p>Mr. Trudeau in April appointed a former Supreme Court of Canada justice to examine the military's culture. In October, the government implemented one of the justice's early recommendationsâ€”to strip the military of the power to investigate and prosecute allegations of sexual misconduct within the service, and hand that responsibility over to civilian authorities.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Trudeau's cabinet fired Adm. Art McDonald from the role of chief of defense staff, saying the admiral no longer had the administration's confidence. He had been on administrative leave pending an investigation into allegations that he engaged in inappropriate behavior. Investigators said their probe didn't unearth evidence to support charges.</p><p>Attempts to reach Adm. McDonald weren't successful.</p><p>Adm. McDonald's predecessor, Gen. Jonathan Vance, faces an obstruction-of-justice charge. Canadian prosecutors allege the former top soldier attempted to impede the military police's investigation of sexual-misconduct allegations involving him by persuading a witness \"to make false statements about their past relationship,\" according to a court filing. A lawyer for Gen. Vance didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Last week, military police filed charges related to sexual assault and indecent acts against Vice Admiral Haydn Edmundson, who until recently was in charge of human resources at the armed forces. The case is now with civilian prosecutors in the province of Ontario. Brian Greenspan, a lawyer for Mr. Edmundson, said the vice admiral denies any suggestion of criminal misconduct, \"and looks forward to the opportunity to restore his distinguished reputation for service to our country.\"</p><p>Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com</p><p>Canada Issues Apology for Turning Blind Eye to Military's Sexualized Culture</p>",
