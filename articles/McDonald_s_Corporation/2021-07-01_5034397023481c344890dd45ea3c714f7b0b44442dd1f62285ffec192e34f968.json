  "title": "Au Bon Pain Bought by Restaurant Franchisee",
  "text": "<p>Ampex's deal for Au Bon Pain comes as franchisees gather power in the more than $620 billion U.S. eating and drinking sector. Once mom-and-pop operations with proprietors running a store or two, the largest franchisee companies today often own hundreds of restaurants across multiple brands. Some franchisees generate more sales than chains' parents.</p><p>Parent companies own a brand, handle its strategy and set standards, while its franchisees own and operate stores, hire employees and deal with customers. Franchisees typically sign multiyear contracts with set terms, and pay the parent companies upfront costs and ongoing fees.</p><p>An estimated 753,770 franchise establishments represented 7.5 million jobs and $670 billion of economic output in 2020, according to the International Franchise Association trade group. Restaurants are the biggest employers among franchised companies, with nearly six million workers as of May, according to data from payroll processor ADP.</p><p>Richardson, Texas-based Ampex Family of Brands declined to disclose the Au Bon Pain deal's value, but said it included assets and franchise rights for 131 additional locations. The deal was struck late Tuesday.</p><p>Ampex CEO Tabbassum Mumtaz said he intends to expand Au Bon Pain, even as transit hubs and commercial centers have yet to fully bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>\"There is a lot of green space,\" Mr. Mumtaz said. \"As the country returns to normal, we believe the cafes will, too.\"</p><p>Many franchisees have done better than independent restaurants during the pandemic because of their larger capital reserves and established to-go operations, according to chain executives and industry analysts. Franchisees' growing clout has allowed them more latitude to push back against company mandates and lobby chains for new products. McDonald's Corp. released a new chicken sandwich line earlier this year, following years of urging from franchisees.</p><p>Carrols Restaurants Group Inc., the largest U.S. Burger King owner, made $1.5 billion in sales last year.</p><p>San Francisco, Calif.-based Flynn Restaurant Group LP, the largest U.S. restaurant franchise, generates around $3.5 billion in sales across its Applebee's, Panera and other brands.</p><p>Au Bon Pain, known for serving pastries and beverages at airports and city downtowns, averaged around $1.5 million in sales per restaurant across 25 states and Thailand in 2019. Its locations have shrunk since JAB acquired the chain in 2017 as an addition to Panera Bread and converted many to the Panera brand. Since then, Au Bon Pain has scaled back to 171 branded restaurants from around 300.</p><p>Ampex struggled in the early days of the pandemic, though its sales later improved because of its scale and busy drive-throughs, the company said. Like many restaurant franchisees, Ampex benefited from millions of dollars in federal Paycheck Protection Program loans to help prevent layoffs. Established relationships with lenders also helped it weather the crisis, Mr. Mumtaz said.</p>",
