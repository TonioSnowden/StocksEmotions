  "text": "<p>\n  Abundance </p><p>\n  By Jakob Guanzon </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  The Night Always Comes </p><p>\n  By Willy Vlautin </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Paradise, Nevada </p><p>\n  By Dario Diofebi </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Wall Street bond-trader-turned-photojournalist Chris Arnade has explained that to begin to get a sense of the lives of poor people in America it is crucial to grasp the importance of two places: McDonald's and Walmart. For those who belong to what Mr. Arnade calls the country's \"back row,\" these serve as improvised community centers -- warm, well-lighted spaces with clean bathrooms (and in Walmart's case, free overnight parking) where they can connect with others without spending much money. </p><p>\n  Jakob Guanzon's debut, \"Abundance\" (Graywolf, 286 pages, $16), begins in a McDonald's and ends in a Walmart, and in between it depicts a harrowing 24 hours in the life of a penniless Minnesota day laborer and ex-felon named Henry, who lives in his truck with his son, Junior. The trip to McDonald's is to celebrate Junior's eighth birthday, for which Henry also plans to splurge on a discount motel room, where a hot bath and cable TV await. Such luxuries are also meant to prepare Henry for a job interview the following afternoon that could turn his fortunes around. \"Abundance\" is a novel of suspense that follows Henry's attempt to hold things together for the interview in spite of the obstacles -- illness, malnutrition, vagrancy laws, thieves, scammers and any of a thousand small, unforeseen expenses -- that make every day a tightrope act. </p><p>\n  The chapter headings, which track Henry's steadily evaporating funds -- in the first chapter he's got $89.34 -- reinforce the stakes of every purchase, every decision. Mr. Guanzon is good at registering the endless calculations that go into staying afloat, from the packets of sugar and ketchup pocketed to provide energy rushes during the day to the \"Goodwill suit that'd cost more to dry clean than purchase.\" Trying to enjoy a snack at the motel yields a moment of absurdity: \"Nothing on earth turns down money,\" Henry thinks, \"except old vending machines.\" </p><p>\n  Mr. Guanzon has also chosen to widen his story through lengthy interspersed flashbacks recounting Henry's marriage, his fateful friendship with a small-time drug pusher and his struggles to rehabilitate after his prison term. The context fleshes out Henry's active role in his poverty -- he's not simply a random victim of the system -- but it seriously diffuses the tension of the scenes in the razor's-edge present. The writing suffers in the shift from particularities to the kind of artsy, metaphor-laden exposition cultivated in creative-writing programs (a fight with his wife leaves Henry feeling \"lacquered . . . in a tarry resin of frustration and inadequacy\"). Ultimately, this promising first novel can feel curiously loose and profligate, as though it might have learned more from the punishing discipline that is all that separates Henry from disaster. </p><p>\n  In Willy Vlautin's \"The Night Always Comes\" (Harper, 208 pages, $26.99), Lynette has spent \"three years without looking up once,\" working multiple jobs (not all of them on the books), taking community-college economics courses and somehow caring for her mentally impaired older brother, all with the aim of saving up enough of a down payment to buy the house she rents with her mother in their gentrifying neighborhood in Portland, Ore. Manic-depressive episodes in her youth have left Lynette with bad credit and she needs her mother to assume the mortgage, but when the novel begins, the burned-out woman is having second thoughts about taking on an endless loan. Faced with the sudden ruin of her plans, Lynette sets off into the night to call in debts and favors, and the story follows her desperate, rain-soaked misadventures in the company of the city's lowlifes. </p><p>\n  As in \"Abundance,\" the pressures of poverty give the novel its vivid unpredictability, creating an almost constant temptation to lawlessness. Lynette feels speared on a paradox of the American Dream -- realistically, in order to become a responsible homeowner and caretaker, she has to cheat and steal. Which is to say, to be a good citizen she has to give up the idea of being good. \"That's what's been bothering me lately,\" says her mother, who has become jaded and exhausted by the hypocrisy. \"Why does it matter to feel bad about anything?\" </p><p>\n  Like Mr. Guanzon, Mr. Vlautin has some trouble integrating his characters' pasts into the narrative. Here it comes out in a number of unnaturally long-winded monologues. Nevertheless, \"The Night Always Comes\" is a taut, action-packed production with a memorable protagonist who never abandons her sense of moral truth amid the Darwinian scramble for cash. </p><p>\n  \"Las Vegas is a city of stories,\" muses a casino-dweller in Dario Diofebi's \"Paradise, Nevada\" (Bloomsbury, 494 pages, $28), to which a friend replies, \"And they're all about money, and power.\" Though this sounds obvious enough, the surprise in this debut is that it's power rather than money that drives the disparate cast of characters. Ray is a numbers genius and online poker champ whose self-worth relies on his ability to apply his \"game theory optimal strategy\" to live games; Mary Ann is a cocktail waitress who joins forces with other underpaid servers to sabotage the house; Lindsay is an investigative reporter looking for dirt on an iconic casino owner; and Tom is a mild-mannered low-stakes poker grinder trying to build up the nerve to be a big dog at the tables -- a \"beta,\" as his frat-boy roommate would put it, seeking a way to \"alphaness.\" </p><p>\n  Through these loosely linked storylines, Mr. Diofebi, a former poker professional, aims to present a complete picture of Las Vegas in all its sprawl and chaos. The opening lines -- \"Everything was at once extraordinary and dull. Dazzling and quotidian\" -- nod at its Dickensian ambitions, though it has more in common with slangy, hyperverbal David Foster Wallace-inspired doorstoppers that are sometimes affixed with the label \"hysterical realism.\" There aren't scenes so much as onslaughts of information, about the region's folklore or the mathematics of card counting (Ray's chapters have lines like \"BET 1.5 x pot 21 combos / 33.3% value: [AA; KK; QQ 16%] -- 13 combos\"). It's a dizzying experience, full of noise and flashing lights and only infrequent brushes with believable human behavior. Extraordinary and dull gets it about right. </p><p></p>",
