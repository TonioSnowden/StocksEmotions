  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start: Josh Harris</strong>, the US billionaire and former top executive at <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a266513-3cd8-4e32-bc10-208a5bbb4c0f#comments-anchor\">is exploring a bid</a> for <strong>Chelsea </strong>football club, said people familiar with the matter.</p> <h2>Tech sell-off grabs tiger cubs by the tail</h2> <p>We've posed the question time and time again: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdsCjokUGi0\"><em>what is <strong>SoftBank</strong>?</em></a></p> <p>But today DD would like to launch a new inquiry about <strong>Tiger Global</strong>.</p> <p>Like the elusive Japanese investment group subject to <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong>'s changing whims, the $90bn-in-assets investment firm run by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1d1c558-9a87-4843-9cd8-29ab203b7911\">“Tiger cub”</a><strong> Chase Coleman </strong>has gained notoriety making aggressive bets on technology companies.</p> <p>And also like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb02efc1-6dab-468b-9691-296b8e35d4dd\">shape-shifter</a> SoftBank, the bullish investment group descended from <strong>Julian Robertson</strong>'s <strong>Tiger Management </strong>hedge fund dynasty is difficult to pin down.</p> <p>What started out as a public stockpicking hedge fund under Coleman has evolved into a multipronged operation that has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54bb342c-230f-4438-a4d7-7cbde010ea1a\">risen to stardom</a> on its private investment funds — overseen by longtime executive <strong>Scott Shleifer</strong>.</p> <p>The pandemic had brought about a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ccfc6bbd-56b6-4cef-b89d-4f88ceb7b126\">golden era</a> of billion-dollar tech valuations in which Tiger's move-fast-and-break-things approach dominated, drawing in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11834bc1-f9b3-43a8-b142-7e890d85a11e\">eye-popping amounts</a> of fresh capital and the ire of Silicon Valley's parochial ranks.</p> <p>Tiger Global was willing to strike quicker deals for higher prices, and forgo board seats in the process. Traditional venture capital rivals such as <strong>Andreessen Horowitz</strong>,<strong> Sequoia Capital</strong> and <strong>Accel</strong> were forced to move faster and stomach more risk, or <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e6b7543-3000-45e5-aee8-e8ccc9b5f661\">chance being edged out</a> of their own territory.</p> <p>But while Tiger Global continues to make huge bets via its private markets arm, many of the fast-growing yet speculative companies it backed have gone public over the past few years. And they haven't lived up to their sky-high valuations.</p> <p>Tiger Global and its fellow “cubs” — including <strong>Philippe Laffont's</strong> <strong>Coatue Management, Glen Kacher's</strong> <strong>Light Street Capital </strong>and <strong>Andreas Halvorsen's</strong> <strong>Viking</strong> — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4af5c796-b8a5-4046-baf4-c9c7411929c2\">have been hit by “brutal” sell-offs</a> in technology stocks, our colleagues Laurence Fletcher and Akila Quinio report.</p> <p>Here are some of the numbers, according to FT sources (markets have continued to fall, so DD's best guess is that these figures have taken a further turn for the worse since they were gathered):</p> <p>One of the most painful holdings has been <strong>Peloton</strong>, the fitness group battered by ballooning losses and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29e18453-dfea-4236-a18c-2c3a018a843a\">bad PR</a> in which Tiger Global, Coatue, Light Street and Viking all held positions during 2021.</p> <p>But unlike that fateful <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3693cfe-ad2a-44d5-a447-46fc4edf6937\"><em>Sex and the City</em> episode</a>, many of the cubs' hedge fund peers saw the fitness group's tour de trouble coming from a mile away. </p> <p><strong>Odey Asset Management</strong>'s <strong>James Hanbury</strong> shorted Peloton until late last year, for instance, according to documents seen by the FT.</p> <p>“It's amazing they missed it,” said one industry insider whose fund made money betting against Peloton, about the cubs. “It wasn't like these issues were hidden.”</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8732989.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>It could be the case that Robertson's cubs are suffering from a case of pack mentality. Many have drawn criticism for significant overlap in their portfolio positions and similar penchants for placing aggressive bets in crowded, overvalued markets.</p> <p>But if Tiger Global is truly anything like SoftBank, DD ventures to guess Coleman won't appreciate being lumped in with the crowd.</p> <p>Case in point: partners at the firm are committing $1bn of their own cash to back seed funds that focus on early-stage start-ups, as The Information <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiger-global-partners-commit-1-billion-for-early-stage-tech-funds\">revealed</a>. Could its latest identity be as a family office?</p> <h2>Consolidation calls in Spain</h2> <p>Spanish telecoms group <strong>MasMovil</strong> drew a close to a complex love triangle on Tuesday when it announced that it had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d87edda4-81f9-40a1-ab15-3dc5e1859133\">entered exclusive talks</a> to merge with French rival<strong> Orange</strong> in Spain. </p> <p><strong>Vodafone</strong>, which had held talks with MasMovil since last year about a possible joint venture or sale of its Spanish business, was left out in the cold.</p> <p>If approved, the two companies will form a 50-50 joint venture valued at €19.6bn.</p> <p>MasMovil — which was bought out by a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f1bd080-aab2-46ec-870e-0edc65ae4878\">private equity trio</a> of <strong>KKR</strong>, <strong>Cinven</strong> and <strong>Providence Equity Partners</strong> in 2020 — isn't expected to stay private for the long term. Under the proposed merger, Orange would have the right to purchase a controlling stake in the event of a future IPO.</p> <p>The news could come as a blow to Vodafone, which has been under pressure to strike a deal for its Spanish business and will be overtaken in market share by the newly formed group.</p> <p>Earlier this year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/769c1d71-d2d8-44c8-947f-403229cfd54a\">activist investor <strong>Cevian</strong></a> took a stake in Vodafone and pushed for an overhaul of the business, adding to the sense of urgency for the British telecoms group.</p> <p>All isn't lost for Vodafone. Excessive competition in Europe has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87bf423f-b0f6-48e5-a5d8-87c0abc4b788\">squeezed prices to a pulp</a>, as Lex notes, where competition authorities have been uninterested in pushing for consolidation. A deal would lift margins for everyone involved as four major players become three.</p> <p>All parties stand to benefit from a green light from regulators because more European M&amp;A is needed to achieve the scale necessary in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0566d63d-5ec2-42b6-acf8-2c84606ef5cf\">global race</a> to build out 5G networks.</p> <h2>How far is Disney willing to go with sports betting? </h2> <p><strong>Disney</strong>'s chief executive <strong>Bob Chapek </strong>likes to say that “the consumer is our North Star”.</p> <p>When it comes to sports, customers are leading the company known for magic-peddling mice straight to the gambling table.</p> <p>Hence Chapek's determination to push deeper into sports betting, mainly through <strong>ESPN+</strong>, the streaming service of its sports cable network which links viewers directly to their online-betting platforms of choice. For legal reasons, DD reckons they won't market it as the happiest place on earth.</p> <p>Betting, will attract “the younger consumer . . . [who wants] to have gambling as part of their sports experience”, Chapek said during last month's results call.</p> <p>The question is how Chapek plans to make this happen. Disney's presence in betting is fairly modest. It acquired a 6 per cent stake in<strong> DraftKings</strong>, a fantasy sports and betting group, when it bought<strong> 21st Century Fox</strong> in 2019. It also has a deal with <strong>Caesars</strong>, <strong>ESPN</strong>'s exclusive sports book odds data provider and the owner of the Las Vegas studio where the channel films much of its betting programmes.</p> <p>A licensing deal with, say, DraftKings, Caesars or its Vegas neighbour<strong> MGM </strong>would allow ESPN to conquer a larger slice of the market without actually handling the mechanics of taking bets — a distinction that could be lost on some consumers who care about Disney's wholesome, family-friendly image. </p> <p>(Chapek isn't worried about this, pointing to internal research showing that ESPN's ties to sports betting aren't going to harm the Disney brand.) </p> <p><strong>Rich Greenfield</strong>, an analyst at<strong> LightShed</strong>, said Disney has other options — including merging ESPN with a sportsbook and creating a separate business. “My gut is they run ESPN as a cash cow and use it to build the Disney Plus streaming business,” he added. </p> <p>Disney will spend $33bn on content this year, up $8bn from a year ago, as it aims for profitability and about 240mn subscribers by 2024. </p> <p>“I think there are lots of strategic decisions to make,” Greenfield said. “It's not obvious what those decisions are.”</p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice</strong> has appointed <strong>Simon Tinkler</strong> as a senior legal adviser in a part-time role. He joins from <strong>Clifford Chance</strong> where he was a partner.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Barclays </strong>has appointed<strong> Corinne Grain</strong> as a managing director in senior relationship management, based in Paris. She was previously the bank's head of equities distribution for Europe, the Middle East and Asia.</p></li>  <li><p>Credit investment firm <strong>Canyon Partners</strong> has named its chief financial officer<strong> Luis Silva</strong>, head of European investments, and <strong>Davide Amico</strong> and real estate co-heads<strong> Robin Potts</strong> and<strong> Maria Stamolis </strong>as partners, according to a letter seen by DD. Partner <strong>Jonathan Heller</strong> and veteran investor <strong>Sergey Kamensky</strong> are leaving the firm.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Sixth Street </strong>has hired former <strong>TCV </strong>partner<strong> Nari Ansari</strong> as a senior leader on its growth equity investing team.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Smart reads</strong></p> <p><strong>Survival mode</strong> Russia's VTB was meant to rival Europe's biggest lenders. Moscow bankers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8ceaee9-aac4-42b7-b698-c3bf2a616f36\">speak to the FT</a> about how the country's global banking ambitions took a back seat to financing Putin's war machine, and are suffering as a result.</p> <p><strong>Londongrad's finest </strong>Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash made billions protecting the Kremlin's gas empire in his home country, and was investigated by the FBI for his ties to Russia.
