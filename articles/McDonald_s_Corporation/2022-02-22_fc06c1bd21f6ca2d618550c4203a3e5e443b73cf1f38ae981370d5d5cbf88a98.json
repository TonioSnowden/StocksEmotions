  "text": "<p>   \"We have come to the conclusion that we are not in control,\" said Mr. Gibson. \"That is not a comfortable place to be.\" </p><p>   Some firms such as QualTech Technologies Inc., a manufacturer of custom electronics in Willoughby, Ohio, now regularly turn to brokers for semiconductors and other components in short supply, sometimes at five or 10 times the normal cost. \"We might do it a couple of times a year in a very normalized market,\" said QualTech president David Vance. \"Now, we do it every day.\" </p><p>   The 38-person company has been able to pass along about half of the cost increases, Mr. Vance estimates, but the company absorbs the rest. \"It's not the customers' fault,\" he said. \"It's just the sheer inability for a small company to manage the velocity at which [prices] change.\" </p><p>   At Su Casa Furniture, a furniture and home goods retailer, employees now spend as many as 40 hours a week changing prices. Pre-pandemic, Su Casa repriced items twice a year. </p><p>   Vendors now routinely add surcharges of as much as 21% to items ordered months earlier. \"We have no other option but to eat that price increase,\" said Su Casa owner Nick Johnson, who has two stores in Maryland and two in Delaware. </p><p>   Businesses such as Su Casa have struggled to keep up with wages paid by McDonald's Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and other big employers. \"If somebody comes in to apply here and we tell them anything short of $15 [an hour], they don't even take the application,\" said Mr. Johnson, who has 12 full-time and 26 part-time workers. </p><p>   Sixty-five percent of small-business owners surveyed in February said hiring challenges are impacting their ability to operate at full capacity, according to a survey of more than 590 small businesses for The Wall Street Journal by Vistage Worldwide Inc., a business coaching and peer advisory firm. </p><p>   Advanced Supply Chain International, a supply-chain consulting business, is struggling to predict the future direction of wages, complicating its efforts to bid on five-year contracts. \"We don't have the working capital to fund a year of inflationary wages and wait for everything to catch up,\" said Christine Hopkins, chief executive of the Anchorage-based company, which is focused on the oil and gas and other asset-intensive industries. It has 20 employees, down from 190 in early 2020. </p><p>   Ms. Hopkins's company began going after higher-margin contracts that require it to lease and operate warehouse space, jobs it previously passed up because it deemed them too risky. \"It feels like there are less small businesses, and the bigger companies just got bigger,\" she said. </p><p>   Ethel's, the wholesale bakery outside of Detroit, last summer hired its first director of operations and purchasing, who spent much of his first few months negotiating contracts with important suppliers. The baker has increased inventory by 50% to help control pricing and minimize the risk of supply-chain disruptions, and set up a line of credit to cover the added expense. </p><p></p>",
