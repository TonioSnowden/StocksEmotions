  "text": "<p>McDonald's Corp. said it is temporarily closing its 847 restaurants in Russia, after investors and consumers called for the chain to cut ties with the country in light of its invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>The chain said it would continue paying the 62,000 people it employs there. McDonald's said it couldn't yet determine when it might reopen the restaurants in Russia, and will consider whether any additional steps might be required.</p><p>\"Our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine,\" Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said in a message to employees and other company personnel Tuesday.</p><p>McDonald's owns and operates 84% of its restaurants in Russia, with the rest run by franchisees, serving millions of customers daily, the chain said. The company said that both company and franchised restaurants will temporarily shut down in the country.</p><p>The New York State Comptroller, who oversees the state's public pension fund investments that owns McDonald's shares, had called on the company to review its Russian business to assess the best interests of the company and its shareholders, including the New York State Common Retirement Fund. Online petitions have circulated on social media in recent days calling for McDonald's and other U.S. restaurant chains to pull out of Russia.</p><p>McDonald's also owns and operates 108 restaurants in Ukraine, along with corporate offices, employing nearly 10,000 people. Those locations are closed, and the company is working to maintain its payroll system in the country to keep paying employees there, McDonald's said in an internal message last week.</p><p>Russia and Ukraine accounted for around 9% of McDonald's revenue last year given the high percentage of company owned restaurants, the company said in a filing. The countries accounted for 2% of sales across McDonald's, and less than 3% of operating income, the chain said.</p><p>McDonald's Will Temporarily Close Russian Locations</p>",
