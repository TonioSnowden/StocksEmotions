  "title": "Business News: McDonald's Raises Menu Prices --- Fast-food giant aims to keep pace with increased costs in U.S., citing jump in wages",
  "text": "<p>Average wage increases at McDonald's U.S. restaurants have continued from the company's second quarter, when executives reported they were up around 5% domestically during the period. Higher wages, including an average 15% increase this year at company-owned U.S. restaurants, is helping with recruitment, but not as much as anticipated, executives said.</p><p>\"Certainly I was hoping and expecting that we were going to see the situation improve maybe a little bit more quickly than what's materialized,\" Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski told investors on Wednesday.</p><p>The Big Mac maker also is paying more for paper, food and other supplies, executives said. McDonald's expects its commodity costs for the year to rise by 3.5% to 4%, up from the 2% they grew earlier in 2021, executives said.</p><p>Those higher costs are making their way to consumers, as McDonald's executives said they expect U.S. prices to be up about 6% this year compared with last year.</p><p>Companies across the globe are raising consumer prices in response to growing costs spanning distribution and freight to fuel and food. U.S. inflation in September remained at its highest rate in more than a decade, Labor Department data showed.</p><p>Starbucks Corp. said Wednesday it will increase average U.S. employee pay to $17 an hour from $14. Baristas who have been with the coffee chain for two or more years will get pay increases of as much as 5%, Starbucks said, and those with five or more years on the job will be eligible for a raise of up to 10%.</p><p>Many restaurants are raising menu prices to offset higher wages for cooks and servers and rising costs for meat, packaging, vegetable oil and other commodities.</p><p>McDonald's said global same-store sales in the quarter ended Sept. 30 increased 10.2% compared with the same period before the pandemic. U.S. same-store sales were up 14.6% compared with the equivalent 2019 period.</p><p>McDonald's said bigger order sizes and higher prices increased its revenue in the U.S., as did its new crispy chicken sandwich and celebrity-endorsed meals. Diners are placing more to-go orders and buying for larger groups than prior to the pandemic, contributing to higher sales per customer, executives said.</p><p>\"We are still selling more sandwiches, we're still selling more fries,\" Mr. Kempczinski said.</p><p>Quarterly net income climbed 22% from a year earlier, rising to $2.15 billion. Sales totaling $6.2 billion increased 14% from the previous year's period. Adjusting for one-time items, McDonald's said it earned $2.76 a share.</p><p>The company's sales and earnings topped analysts' expectations. McDonald's shares rose 2.7% to $242.73 each.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
