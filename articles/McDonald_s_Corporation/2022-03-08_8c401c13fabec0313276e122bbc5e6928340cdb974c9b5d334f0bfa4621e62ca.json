  "title": "Stolichnaya is rebranding to distance its Latvian-made vodka from Putin's Russia",
  "text": "<p>Stoli Group announced the rebrand, to simply “Stoli,” on Friday. In a statement, the Luxembourg-headquartered company said its founder's opposition to the Putin regime played a major role in the decision.</p><p>“While I have been exiled from&#xa0;Russia&#xa0;since 2000 due to my opposition to Putin, I have remained proud of the Stolichnaya brand,” Yuri Shefler, founder of&#xa0;Stoli Group, said in a statement. “Today, we have made the decision to rebrand entirely as the name no longer represents our organization. More than anything, I wish for ‘Stoli' to represent peace in&#xa0;Europe&#xa0;and solidarity with&#xa0;Ukraine.” &#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p><p>Stoli's production facilities have been based in Latvia since 2000, and last week the company said it was moving to exclusively use Slovakian grains to ensure a “100% non-Russian” product.</p><p>See: TikTok, AmEx, Netflix join list of companies suspending operations in Russia </p><p>Also: McDonald's to shutter all 850 of its locations in Russia over Putin aggression vs. Ukraine </p><p>And: Adidas joins Nike and other companies in pausing operations in Russia over Putin's invasion of Ukraine </p><p>“We have employees, partners and distributors in the region directly impacted. They are asking that we take a bold stand. This is one actionable, meaningful thing we can do to make it clear that we support&#xa0;Ukraine,”&#xa0;Stoli Group Chief Executive Damian McKinney said in the statement.</p><p>Recently, Russian vodka has been pulled off shelves of some stores in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.  as a sign of support for Ukraine. Stoli has gotten caught up in that — one liquor store owner in Michigan told the Associated Press  last week he had yanked Stolichnaya from his shelves, apparently believing it was Russian, and started promoting a Ukrainian brand instead.</p><p>The company also said it has made a financial commitment to World Central Kitchen , chef Jose Andres' nonprofit group that is helping feed Ukrainian refugees .</p><p>The Stolichnaya brand dates back to the early 1900s, but gained fame during the Cold War years as a rare Soviet export to the West. The state-run distillery was privatized after the fall of the Soviet Union, but Stoli Group and the Russian government have been embroiled in a trademark dispute  for nearly two decades.</p><p>Stoli Group was established in 2013, and besides its signature vodka, distributes rum, tequila, gin and wine brands in more than 175 markets worldwide.</p><p>Read on: Biden announces U.S. ban on Russian oil imports, conceding Americans will bear some cost</p>",
