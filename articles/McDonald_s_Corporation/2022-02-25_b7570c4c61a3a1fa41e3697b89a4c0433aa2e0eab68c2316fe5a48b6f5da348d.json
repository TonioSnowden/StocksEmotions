  "title": "Beyond Meat Hit by Slower Supermarket Sales of Plant-Based Food; Meat alternative maker says slowdown is temporary; Beyond is developing new products and ramping up efforts in grocery stores",
  "text": "<p>U.S. grocery sales dropped nearly 20% in the quarter, reflecting what Beyond said was lower demand, fewer shipping days versus the year-ago period, increased discounts and lost market share. Chief Executive Ethan Brown said the company considers lower grocery sales a temporary disruption to growth, and that it is taking multiple steps to rejuvenate sales, including launching new products and boosting sampling in grocery stores following a slowdown during the pandemic.</p><p>\"We certainly think the category is going to recover,\" Mr. Brown said on a conference call Thursday.</p><p>Beyond shares fell 15% in early trading to $41.58.</p><p>Mr. Brown said Beyond also had focused its U.S. innovation on restaurants last year, prioritizing business with fast-food chains and a joint venture with PepsiCo Inc. Earlier this year, Beyond introduced Beyond Fried Chicken in over 4,000 KFC stores, while McDonald's Corp. has expanded its U.S. test of the McPlant burger, developed with Beyond. Whether or not such products win a permanent place on menus will factor into Beyond's performance this year, the company said.</p><p>\"We are obviously working toward more permanent menu placement,\" said Mr. Brown.</p><p>Beyond's U.S. food-service sales grew 35% in the latest quarter, and the company added about 2,000 U.S. food-service outlets to its roster, compared with the prior quarter.</p><p>Beyond, founded in 2009, uses yellow pea protein, potato starch, canola oil and other ingredients to make burger patties, sausages and nuggets that aim to more closely replicate traditional meat's taste and appearance. Beyond and rival Impossible Foods Inc. have promoted their meat substitutes as friendlier to animals and the environment and have landed products on the menus of fast-food chains like Burger King, Carl's Jr. and White Castle, as well as major supermarkets.</p><p>Traditional meat producers have challenged those claims, raising questions about meat substitutes' nutritional content and in some cases seeking to prevent alternative products from using terms like \"beef\" or \"meat.\"</p><p>Beyond shares peaked above $234 in mid-2019 after the company's initial public offering at a price of $25 earlier that year. Shares have fallen since then as meat alternative makers have dealt with pandemic-related challenges and uncertainty around the products' growth prospects. Beyond's stock has fallen about 71% in the past 12 months.</p><p>Maple Leaf Foods Inc., a Canadian meat company that in 2017 acquired plant-based food maker Lightlife Foods, this week said that an internal company analysis showed that after years of rapid growth, the category had stalled.</p><p>\"All major brands and products across the category are experiencing similar challenges, which largely seems to be driven by consumers' experience in terms of taste, price, degree of processing and ease of preparation,\" said Curtis Frank, Maple Leaf's president.</p><p>Beyond's Mr. Brown said Thursday that his company continues to develop new products and is working to reduce the cost of its products versus traditional meat, a long-term goal that Mr. Brown has said would help convince more consumers to try the products.</p><p>Some of the pandemic-related challenges faced by the meat alternative maker will pass, Mr. Brown said, such as consumers' recent penchant for comfort foods over healthier ones and fewer opportunities for people to try Beyond's products in stores.</p><p>\"Sit tight,\" Mr. Brown told analysts on a conference call. \"We're going to be coming back, I think, the latter part of this year.\"</p><p>Write to Jesse Newman at jesse.newman@wsj.com</p><p>Beyond Meat Hit by Slower Supermarket Sales of Plant-Based Food</p>",
