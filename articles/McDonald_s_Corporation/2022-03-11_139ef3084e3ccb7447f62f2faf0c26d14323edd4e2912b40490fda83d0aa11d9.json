  "title": "The Lex Newsletter: Europe's Faustian pact with Putin has unravelled spectacularly",
  "text": "<p>In folk tales, the devil barters earthly bounty for souls at a road junction. But Europe's Faustian pact with Russia unravelled rather than coalesced at the crossroads of the Ukraine war this week.</p> <p>Vladimir Putin's barbaric assault on Ukrainians forced Europeans to reassess the cost of the gas heating German homes and the money paying for British trophy assets of oligarchs. Russia has exacted that price in acquiescence from both countries towards its repressive president and his coterie of oligarchs.</p> <p>This week was a turning point for Europe albeit that the toughest action — a ban on Russian oil imports — came solely from the US. View that ban in conjunction with UK sanctions on Roman Abramovich and the effects of other curbs and it is clear Russian financial influence is collapsing across democratic Europe.</p> <p>Please email me at <a href=\"mailto:Lexfeedback@ft.com\">Lexfeedback@ft.com</a> with your thoughts on Lex's coverage. Our analyses this week are divided into three categories: the oil embargo and its implications, oligarchs, and the wider financial repercussions of the conflict.</p> <h2>The oil embargo</h2> <p>At present this is a unilateral ban from the US with accompanying <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97c07bd5-4d57-44bf-8ac1-09f1879b97c7\">chilling effect</a>. Even before the announcement of the embargo, the oil price had risen, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d267e8b-4788-4431-80d3-fa319f9ee5dd\">making a packet</a> for US activist Carl Icahn. He sold out of <strong>Occidental Petroleum</strong> even as Warren Buffett bought in.</p> <p>If the slaughter of Ukrainians by the Russian military brings Europeans into the oil embargo too, massive disruption to energy supply chains would result. </p> <p>Lex envisages a series of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a66d457-75e3-4928-bc3b-c0919fa1be5f\">safety valves</a> venting some of the pressure on prices. The allies would release strategic reserves. Chinese and Indian refineries would buy more Russian crude. The United Arab Emirates and US shale drillers would increase output, the latter with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ab3e7fa-5ae0-4e75-84bd-8c1f36f779d1\">patriotism </a>as well as profit in mind.</p> <p>Oil traders such as <strong>Glencore</strong>, <strong>Trafigura</strong> and <strong>Glencore</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f1eff67-2c1a-4ec3-ae59-e6e3ec9810c2\">should do nicely</a> amid this global grinding of gears. Knowing where cargoes that are not under sanctions are available will make them popular with customers.</p> <p>Europe would still have to use less energy. It would also have to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23311e2d-753e-4129-b324-4439e670a4ed\">wean itself off Russian natural gas</a>. Germany would have to complete its liquefied natural gas terminal. The EU would need to install more interconnectors to join up gas pipes. And everyone would have to invest more money in renewables.</p> <p>Steeper energy prices are already <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a4ef6b4-10dc-4da4-9200-8957acf35c63\">hurting transport businesses</a> such as airlines, of which, post-pandemic, it may accurately be said “as one door shuts, another one closes”.</p> <p>You might say the same of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/878037e0-1fea-4db5-b0fe-6b454e235d94\">European banks</a>. <strong>UniCredit</strong>, <strong>BNP Paribas</strong> and <strong>Société Générale</strong> detailed their Russian and Ukrainian exposures this week. But the real blows to the sector will come from the postponement of interest rate rises and new, politically motivated curbs on payouts to investors. But banks do at least boast capital levels that airline bosses would die for.</p> <h2>Oligarchs</h2> <p>A Russian oligarch commissioned a friend of mine who is an upmarket builder to remodel his huge London mansion. “I need protective glass in the windows,” the client demanded. “Bulletproof?” my friend asked. “No, mortar-proof,” the client replied.</p> <p>The UK capital has earned the nickname “Londongrad” for its concentrations of offshore Russian wealth, much of it of dubious provenance. Applications have included real estate investment, cosying up to politicians in the ruling Conservative party and forestalling criticism in the British media through heavy expenditure on libel lawyers.</p> <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has claimed legal challenges were also to blame for a surprising lack of sanctions against some prominent oligarchs. This week, he grew a backbone as Russia intensified indiscriminate shelling of Ukraine's cities. The UK government imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs linked to the Kremlin, most notably Abramovich.</p> <p>Lex pointed out such sanctions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/652868ca-1699-4cd8-bc7c-8a3f4dc13a55\">could be swifter</a> to forestall asset liquidations. Abramovich had already put up for sale football club <strong>Chelsea</strong>, valued at £3bn, and a mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens. </p> <p>One of his two superyachts has reportedly left its berth in Barcelona. The Russian fleet of tycoon superyachts are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fdae8a9-9380-4a4d-a898-6a9f173df2fd\">steaming away</a> from European and US anchorages and towards less fastidious havens.</p> <p>Abramovich's assets also include a controlling stake in London-listed steelmaker <strong>Evraz</strong> and shares in <strong>Norilsk Nickel</strong>. Fears of sanctions against the nickel miner pushed up prices for the metal early this week. That jump triggered a squeeze on the short positions of Chinese tycoon Xiang “Big Shot” Guangda, including demands for extra cash margin.</p> <p>Lex expects the pattern of margin calls to repeat, not least on the hefty personal loans many Russian oligarchs have secured against shares whose value has now collapsed. The <strong>Moscow stock exchange</strong> may have closed two weeks ago partly to forestall the financial chaos these margin calls could create.</p> <p>The <strong>London Metal Exchange,</strong> meanwhile, suspended nickel contracts and cancelled some trades. This <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28a62f18-b25f-48fc-ad45-dc89c6ee7207\">reflected poorly</a> on the business, which is owned by China's <strong>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</strong>. Markets should stay open at all costs to permit open trading and price formation. Bargains must be honoured, not rescinded.</p> <h2>Repercussions</h2> <p>A deal with the devil at the crossroads ends with eternal damnation. Repercussions from the collapse of the west's bargain with Russia will lack that finality but be severe all the same.</p> <p>A swath of Russian banks and businesses have been barred from using large parts of the global financial system. They have been banned from using the <strong>Swift</strong> payments messaging system and from clearing dollars and sterling in the US and UK. <strong>Visa</strong> and <strong>Mastercard</strong> have suspended Russian operations. </p> <p>Claims that Russia will painlessly switch to China's <strong>CIPS</strong> payment system and its <strong>UnionPay</strong> card network <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e9c74da-923f-4c54-bf19-4e03786ab9af\">are facile</a>, in our view. CIPS is small and renminbi-based. Using UnionPay would require Russian banks to install IT infrastructure they can no longer buy from the west.</p> <p>Funding such investments would be tough anyway thanks to tit-for-tat financial boycotts and potential <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f166495-cf22-404d-a161-346a08ae511c\">Russian bond defaults</a>. <strong>Pimco</strong>, the big US bond fund manager, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1aa801b-dc46-4c9a-b455-1a3860a39342\">on the hook for billions of dollars</a>. There will be controversy over whether defaults have occurred and there will be buying opportunities for debt vulture funds.</p> <p>Ambiguity also abounds over how permanent or damaging US suspensions of companies' Russian businesses really are. Burger chain <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84cae29a-23b2-4508-a715-a4bb3c54307e\"><strong>McDonald's</strong> </a>and entertainment group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8af7ec1-bd37-48ea-85a3-4b7b92f73af8\"><strong>Disney</strong> </a>were among groups to pause activity in a market of only modest value to them.</p> <p>Lex is still available in Ukraine and I sometimes send article links to contacts there. I have covered six notable financial crises. This is the first in which I have found myself interviewing economists and bankers in cities being pounded by the artillery of an invader. </p> <p>I will leave you with three recommendations for books on oligarchs and their influence on the west. I make no apology for the fact that one is by current colleague Tom Burgis and another by former FT Moscow correspondent Catherine Belton. These books took courage and skill to write. They are:</p> <p><em>Putin's People</em> by Catherine Belton (William Collins)</p> <p><em>Kleptopia</em> by Tom Burgis (William Collins)</p> <p><em>Abramovich</em> by Dominic Midgley and Chris Hutchins (HarperCollins)</p> <p>Enjoy your weekend, whatever you're reading.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Guthrie<br></strong><em>Head of Lex</em></p><p>Source: Jonathan Guthrie 2022 'The Lex Newsletter: Europe's Faustian pact with Putin has unravelled spectacularly' FT.com 11 March.
