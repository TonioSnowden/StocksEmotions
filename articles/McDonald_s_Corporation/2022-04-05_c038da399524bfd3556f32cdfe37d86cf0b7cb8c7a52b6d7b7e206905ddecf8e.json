  "title": "Business News:  Westrock  Coffee to  Go Public  Via SPAC  ----  By Amrith Ramkumar",
  "text": "<p>   Westrock Coffee Holdings LLC is combining with a special-purpose acquisition company to go public with a valuation of roughly $1.2 billion, company officials said. </p><p>   Little Rock, Ark.-based Westrock sits in the middle of the supply chains for coffee, tea and other beverage ingredients, working with small-scale farmers around the world to eventually provide products for restaurants and brands such as Walmart Inc. and McDonald's Corp. It says its operations account for more than 20 million cups of coffee daily from sustainable, digitally traceable supply chains. </p><p>   Westrock is merging with Riverview Acquisition Corp., a SPAC, in a deal unveiled on Monday. </p><p>   Founded in 2009 to work with coffee farmers in Rwanda, Westrock calls itself a beverage-solutions provider for large companies and says it can do everything from package custom drinks to develop new coffee products. Consumer demand for such drinks surged in recent years. </p><p>   \"Our customers are riding that wave,\" Westrock Chief Executive Scott Ford said. </p><p>   Also called a blank-check company, a SPAC is a shell company that raises money from investors and lists publicly on a stock exchange with the sole purpose of merging with a private firm to take it public. After regulators review the deal and it is completed, the private company replaces the SPAC in the stock market. </p><p>   Such mergers have become popular alternatives to traditional initial public offerings, in part because companies going public can make projections that aren't allowed in traditional IPOs. Westrock says it expects to be profitable this year and for sales to increase more than 30% to about $960 million. </p><p>   As part of its deal, Westrock is raising a $250 million private investment in public equity, or PIPE, from investors including Southeastern Asset Management and the family investment office of the Haslams -- part owners of truck-stop operator Pilot Co. and owners of the National Football League's Cleveland Browns. </p><p>   That money and the $250 million the Riverview SPAC raised in August could be used to expand the business, though SPAC investors can withdraw their money before a deal is completed. Low share prices encourage withdrawals. </p><p></p>",
