  "title": "Donald G. Lubin Helped Ray Kroc Build McDonald's and Buy San Diego Padres; The lawyer, who has died at age 88, did a small legal service freeâ€”and won a big client's trust",
  "text": "<p>He refused to accept any payment for what he saw as a simple favor.</p><p>Ms. Martino was so impressed that she gave Mr. Lubin some billable work: making her will. Then she arranged for him to prepare a will for her boss, Ray Kroc, the head of McDonald's.</p><p>Mr. Lubin bonded with Mr. Kroc, joined the board of McDonald's in 1967 and remained a director for 37 years. Sonnenschein picked up a large share of the legal work as McDonald's expanded globally.</p><p>When Mr. Kroc bought the San Diego Padres baseball team in 1974, Mr. Lubin negotiated the deal and became the team's general counsel. Though the team failed to sign Reggie Jackson, he came away with an autograph for one of his sons.</p><p>Mr. Lubin, who died June 5 at the age of 88, offered this advice: Do even the smallest tasks well and clients will remember you fondly.</p><p>He became one of the biggest rainmakers at Sonnenschein and served as chairman of the Chicago-based firm in the early 1990s. Sonnenschein later merged into what is now the global law firm Dentons.</p><p>As a director of McDonald's, he argued for sticking to the core business, recalled Andrew McKenna, a former chairman of the chain. In the late 1960s, when Mr. Kroc was toying with the idea of developing a theme park, Mr. Lubin was among the advisers who talked him out of it.</p><p>Donald Gilbert Lubin was born Jan. 10, 1934, and grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y. His parents were immigrants from Eastern Europe. His father, Harry Lubin, arrived in the U.S. as a boy, joined the U.S. Cavalry and was part of an unsuccessful attempt to track down the Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa. The elder Mr. Lubin later co-founded a Manhattan-based maker of men's shirts.</p><p>Donald Lubin helped package shirts at his father's firm, played basketball and attended James Madison High School in Brooklyn, where he and Ruth Bader (later Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg) were both members of the Go-Getters Club. He worked as a dishwasher to help pay expenses at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. He graduated in 1954.</p><p>Four law schools accepted him: Harvard, Yale, the University of Pennsylvania and Columbia. Despite his parents' efforts to keep him in New York, he chose Harvard. Shortly after he arrived there, a mutual friend introduced him to Amy Schwartz, who was attending Wellesley College. When he proposed a first date, she demurred because she had promised to spend time with her parents, who were visiting. Her mother insisted that she should meet her suitor.</p><p>The romance survived his choice of a gift for her 19th birthday, a Mr. Potato Head toy, which became a long-running family joke. Within a few months, during an evening of dancing at the Rendezvous Room in New York's Plaza Hotel, Mr. Lubin proposed. They married in 1956.</p><p>He graduated from law school in 1957 and joined Sonnenschein. One of his early clients was Interstate Vending Co., which provided snack-dispensing machines and needed help with acquisitions.</p><p>Writing a will for Ray Kroc led to more legal work, both for Mr. Kroc's personal life and for the fast-growing McDonald's business. Mr. Lubin also became a close friend of Fred Turner, later chief executive of McDonald's.</p><p>J.R. Simplot, whose Idaho potato operations were huge suppliers to McDonald's, became another Lubin client. Mr. Simplot frequently hosted the Lubin family at his homes in Idaho and taught Mr. Lubin to ski.</p><p>As general counsel for the Padres, Mr. Lubin negotiated with stars including Willie McCovey, Rollie Fingers and Dave Winfield. It was a dream job for a man who spent his boyhood revering the Brooklyn Dodgers. He was present when Mr. Kroc, during the Padres' home opening game in 1974, announced over the public address system that his team's performance was \"the stupidest ball playing I've ever seen.\"</p><p>He also advised Mr. Kroc on philanthropy and helped set up what became the Ronald McDonald House Charities. Toting a leather briefcase, he continued reporting regularly to the office until his mid-80s.</p><p>Mr. Lubin, who had Parkinson's disease, is survived by his wife, Amy Lubin, their four children and eight grandchildren.</p><p>Among many other public-service roles, Mr. Lubin was a longtime supporter of the Ravinia music festival in Highland Park, Ill., and a former chairman of its board of trustees. Welz Kauffman, a former chief executive of the festival, recalled that Mr. Lubin sought to solve practical problems, such as how to bring busloads of people in more efficiently.</p><p>In the early 1980s, he had a more glamorous task: introducing a performance by Luciano Pavarotti. While dressing for the event, he remarked that he would be speaking in front of 16,000 people.</p><p>His wife replied: \"And you know what? Not one of them is coming to hear you speak.\"</p><p>Write to James R. Hagerty at bob.hagerty@wsj.com</p><p>Donald G. Lubin Helped Ray Kroc Build McDonald's and Buy San Diego Padres</p>",
