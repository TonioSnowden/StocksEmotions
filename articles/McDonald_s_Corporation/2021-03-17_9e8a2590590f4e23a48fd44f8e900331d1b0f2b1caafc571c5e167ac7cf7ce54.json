  "title": "Politics & Ideas:  Some Bipartisan Ideas for Congress  ----  By William A. Galston",
  "text": "<p>\n  The Biden administration's next big legislative initiative -- a \"build back better\" bill dealing with infrastructure and much else -- is at least several weeks away, and the Democrats are pondering what to do in the interim. I have a proposal: Before what will likely be another divisive debate, focus on legislation that enjoys substantial support across party lines. </p><p>\n  Skeptics will say that I have described a null set, but they are wrong. Though the last two years of the Trump administration were not notable for legislative achievement, bipartisan work continued behind the scenes, laying a foundation for progress this year. Here are four examples: </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  -- China. There is a growing consensus about the challenge Beijing presents to American interests. The Endless Frontier Act, which enjoys bipartisan co-sponsorship in the House and Senate, including by the Senate majority leader, is an obvious place to begin. The bill focuses on areas of science and technology that will be essential to our economy and defense in the coming decades, and it expands the mission of the National Science Foundation. Indiana's Todd Young, the bill's lead Republican sponsor in the Senate, tells me in an interview that \"we are making strategic bets, unapologetically.\" He is hoping for committee markups and consideration on the floor before the end of April. Moving this bill to the finish line should be a top priority. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  -- Immigration. Everyone knows that the status quo is obsolete and unworkable, but Congress has struggled for nearly two decades to fix it. In January, the Biden administration introduced a comprehensive reform bill, but the president has acknowledged that it won't move forward anytime soon. In the interim, however, some pieces may be brought up. </p><p>\n  The first bill addressing the \"Dreamers\" was proposed 20 years ago. Despite wide agreement across party lines that young people brought to the U.S. as minors deserve legal status if they meet certain criteria, nothing has happened. </p><p>\n  Sens. Dick Durbin (D., Ill.), and Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), recently reintroduced a bill that would create a path to legal permanent residence for Dreamers who pursue postsecondary education, work for at least three years or serve in the military. They'd also have to pass background checks, pay a fee, and have a high-school diploma, proficiency in English and U.S. history, and a clean criminal record. </p><p>\n  According to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, almost three million young people meet the age qualifications for this program, and many have already met the remaining standards. Can the House and Senate stop using the Dreamers as leverage and pass this bill? </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  -- Broadband. The pandemic has driven home the reality that high-speed internet access is the electricity of the 21st century. Without broadband, it is hard for businesses in rural areas to thrive and for patients to take advantage of remote medicine. In some urban areas, students have resorted to logging in to remote classes from McDonald's parking lots. </p><p>\n  Since January, several bipartisan bills have been introduced to extend broadband access to unserved communities. This effort will be similar to electrification in the 1930s, and it is straightforward to finance. In February the Federal Communications Commission said it has raised more than $81 billion from its latest auction of publicly owned spectrum to large corporations developing 5G networks. This is roughly what achieving universal broadband would cost, and it would be the most appropriate and productive use of the auction funds. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  -- Prescription-drug prices. Americans have been complaining about rising costs. The Senate Finance Committee has held extensive hearings on the issue, and the previous Congress reached bipartisan agreement on the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act of 2019. Among other provisions, the bill would require manufacturers to provide substantial rebates for drugs whose prices rise faster than inflation. </p><p>\n  The Congressional Budget Office found that the bill would save taxpayers $95 billion over the next decade, reduce out-of-pocket costs by $72 billion, and lower Medicare premiums by $1 billion. For reasons related more to election-year politics than substance, the bill failed to advance in 2020. It is time to revive it, make whatever modifications the committee deems necessary, and put it on the legislative calendar. No doubt the pharmaceutical companies will continue to object, as will those on the left who favor a more aggressive approach. </p><p>\n  Sen. Young says that after partisan divisions over the American Rescue Plan, \"it stands to reason that the Biden administration would look for something that brings us together.\" Indeed. Partisans in the House and Senate have sent most of the past decade debating their many points of disagreement, and the results speak for themselves. It would be refreshing if they spent a month or two every year focused on where they agree. </p><p></p>",
