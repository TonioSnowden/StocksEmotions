  "text": "<p>Board directors highlighted the risks of bitcoin adoption in El Salvador, which took up bitcoinBTCUSD as a legal tender in September, on its financial stability, financial integrity, consumer protection, and the associated fiscal contingent liabilities, according to a Tuesday report that evaluates El Salvador's economy.&#xa0;</p><p>The IMF stressed the importance for El Salvador of providing strict regulation and oversight for the new ecosystem containing bitcoin and the country's Chivo wallet, a government-backed crypto wallet that helps facilitate bitcoin transactions. However, they also highlighted the Chivo wallet's potential role in boosting financial inclusion.&#xa0;</p><p>El Salvador holds more than 1,500 bitcoin and plans to issue a $1 billion, 10-year bond backed by bitcoin this year.&#xa0;</p><p>Bitcoin is recently trading at around $36,959, almost half of its record high of $68,990.&#xa0;</p><p>In face of the bitcoin price downturn, El Salvador president Nayib Bukele, who pushed forward the country's bitcoin adoption, briefly changed his Twitter profile on Monday to that of a McDonald's employee, in reference to an internet meme, where crypto HODL'ers indicate their future career prospects when bitcoin plunges. McDonald's pays as low as $11 per hour.</p><p>https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1485664733122469900?s=20</p>",
