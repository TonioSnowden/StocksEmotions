  "text": "<p>After the extraordinary inhumanity of the Uvalde elementary school massacre two weeks ago, the US returned to a normal level of horror at the weekend. Over two days, 11 shootings left 15 people dead and 61 injured, <a href=\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting\">according to the Gun Violence Archive.</a> NPR described “a spasm of gun violence”. Yet the figures were far from unusual. </p> <p>The gun industry is shrugging off calls for tougher regulation. But it cannot disguise weakness in its business model, comparable even to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f2a85c29-e5fb-43bd-9ce7-c325051b11d7\">tobacco industry</a>. Both sell restricted, low-tech, potentially lethal products that generate little growth and lots of litigation. Guns are not even addictive.</p> <p>Sales — and the shares of gun makers — often rise sharply after mass shootings in anticipation of legislation. Not after Uvalde. Republicans oppose President Joe Biden's plan to prohibit assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Cynics believe there are simply too <a href=\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports/mass-shooting\">many mass shootings</a> in the US for any of them to become a catalyst event. </p> <p>Smith &amp; Wesson is up 12 per cent over the past month, but remains down nearly a third over 12 months. Vista Outdoor, which generates half its revenues from ammunition after selling its gun business, has shed 15 per cent of its value over the past year. Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co has declined by a similar amount.</p> <p>The sheer ordinariness of US trading in military-style firearms is underlined by buy-now-pay-later financing. Daniel Defense, which made the Uvalde shooter's weapon, is among businesses promoted by Credova. This credit company's website states payment options are provided by merchants or a business of North Dakota's Cornerstone Bank, a lender with federal deposit insurance.</p> <p>The centuries-old basic technology of firearms is prosaic too. Familiar brands keep margins up. But growth will therefore remain low — especially following the sales boom of 2021. Smith &amp; Wesson shares trade at about 6 times forward earnings. Sturm, Ruger is double that but at a one-third discount to the S&amp;P 500 index, according to S&amp;P CIQ.</p> <p>The industry is riddled with financial and litigation risks. Remington made the AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle used in the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting. The company filed for bankruptcy in mid-2020 for a second time in two years. It was struggling to pay debts and hefty legal fees. </p> <p>Many US products, from McDonald's hamburgers to Apple iPhones, have been rapid and enduring hits almost everywhere. Cheap firearms for the average householder remain an American cultural anomaly. Even US fund managers do not like the companies that make them.</p> <p><em>The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.
