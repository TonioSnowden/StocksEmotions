  "title": "McDonald's Sales Lifted by Higher Prices, Sandwich Campaigns; Chain says pandemic dining restrictions have improved in some locations",
  "text": "<p>Global same-store sales grew 12.3% compared with the previous year's period as European markets including France, the U.K. and Germany experienced fewer pandemic-related disruptions. The company's sales of $6 billion for the quarter were 12% greater than in the same period before the pandemic.</p><p>McDonald's said that while Covid-19 disruptions have generally eased, the chain still dealt with some government restrictions on restaurant operating hours, limited dine-in seating and some dining-room closures during the quarter. The Omicron variant that has driven a surge in Covid-19 cases globally didn't fully manifest during the company's recently ended quarter.</p><p>McDonald's reported per-share earnings of $2.23, after adjusting for one-time items, below analysts' expectations of $2.34 a share. Net income climbed to $1.6 billion, up 19% from the amount in last year's period.</p><p>The chain's total sales were in line with expectations.</p><p>McDonald's and other restaurant chains have been dealing with rising costs and a labor shortage, and the Omicron variant has exacerbated those problems. Some chains are limiting hours and switching to to-go service only in stores facing an increase in Covid-19 cases.</p><p>McDonald's Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said in an interview last month that the company's U.S. locations were open 10% fewer hours, on average, than before the pandemic because of short staffing.</p><p>McDonald's said last year that it was raising menu prices to keep pace with rapidly growing costs, with wages up at least 10% at U.S. restaurants. McDonald's executives estimated that U.S. prices would increase about 6% last year on an annual basis, because of increasing costs for labor, food, packaging and other materials.</p><p>Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com</p><p>McDonald's Sales Lifted by Higher Prices, Sandwich Campaigns</p>",
