  "text": "<p>Here are the top 10 most trusted brands among U.S. adults, according to the 2022 Most Trusted Brands report.</p><p>The report asked respondents how they valued things like pricing, customer service and ethical business practices â€” and to give their opinions on how much they trust a brand. Both of those responses were then combined to create Morning Consult's \"Net Trust\" score, which is how the brands were ordered for this survey's findings.</p><p>\"Band-Aid's value for price helps it earn and keep trust among U.S. consumers, even if its price point is slightly higher than that of generic brand competitors,\" the report reads.</p><p>Some of the top trusted brands in the U.S. are companies that sell household supplies that people use frequently, particularly health-related supplies. Such items as toothpaste and cleaning solutions are everyday items for millions of Americans.</p><p>Trust can be a major factor for consumers when they are deciding what to spend their money on.</p><p>\"Consumer trust is one of the best predictors of brand loyalty and purchasing consideration,\" Joanna Piacenza, head of industry intelligence at Morning Consult, told Adweek about the findings.</p><p>See also: Amazon, Microsoft, McDonald's and Citi to examine their impact on civil rights and racial equity. Will more companies follow suit?</p><p>The survey saw several companies drop off the top 10 most trusted list in the U.S. since 2020. The U.S. Postal Service, Amazon AMZN, Google GOOG, PayPal PYPL, and Chick-fil-A were among the brands that fell off the list. UPS UPS, The Weather Channel and Cheerios have remained in the top 10 on the list since 2020.</p><p>Responses from the Morning Consult Poll, which also featured data from other countries including China, France and Canada, were taken from March 3 to April 3, 2022, and sampled between 4,614 and 6,401 adults from those countries.</p><p>Toyota JP:7203 was the most trusted brand in Japan, Google was the top brand in India, Tim Hortons was the top brand in Canada, Alipay was the top brand in China and WhatsApp was the top brand in Italy.</p><p>Local origins is a big asset for brands trying to build trust. The top most trusted brand in six of the 10 surveyed countries was established in that country, according to Morning Consult. The 2021 edition of the report did not break down brands by country.</p><p>Band-Aid, CVS and Clorox among the 'most trusted brands' in the U.S., poll shows</p>",
