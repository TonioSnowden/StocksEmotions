  "text": "<p>US fast-food chain Wendy's is accelerating expansion in the UK and preparing to launch in France, Germany and Spain after a strong start to its return to the continent.</p> <p>The group, which has attempted to break into the UK market twice before, said it had been buoyed by sales at the five sites it has opened since it relaunched in Reading in June.</p> <p>Abigail Pringle, Wendy's international president and chief development officer, said revenues at the restaurants it had opened, which include locations in Croydon and Stratford, were “far more” than the chain had expected at £40,000 a week.</p> <p>As a result, Wendy's will up the pace of its UK growth, Pringle said, with a target of opening 50 locations next year on top of the five restaurants and five delivery-only or<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31240e24-32e2-411f-8976-2127d16568c8\"> “dark” kitchens</a> that it has launched this year. The new openings are an increase from a previous target of 10 new outlets in 2022.</p> <p>The sites will be a mixture of dark kitchens, dine-in restaurants and drive-thrus, the company said. It will open the delivery-only stores through a franchise agreement with SoftBank-backed Reef Technology, which operates dark kitchens on parking lots, and has signed two franchise partners to open Wendy's restaurants in Yorkshire and the east Midlands.</p> <p>It plans to open stores in the Republic of Ireland in 2023 and is seeking franchise partners to launch elsewhere in Europe.</p> <p>Wendy's operated outlets in the UK in 1980 and then again in 1992 but retrenched in 2001 saying that property costs were too high and it needed to focus on its core US business. Pringle said the US had “not been in a position of strength” — at the time its share price was roughly $5 compared with $21 now — but that third time around Wendy's was “the strongest we have ever been” having recently overtaken Burger King to become the second-biggest US fast-food chain by revenues.</p> <p>This month, the group reported sales growth of 5.3 per cent across its restaurants, which span 30 markets, reaching a total of $3.1bn in the three months to October 3. Net income rose 3.6 per cent to $41.2m but its margin in company-owned restaurants fell 2.5 per cent to 14.4 per cent because of higher labour and food costs.</p> <p>Wendy's operates 6,900 restaurants, 85 per cent of which are in the US. It is known for its square beef burgers originally designed to show off the quality of the chain's meat. The Wendy's equivalent of McDonald's Big Mac burger costs roughly £1 more.</p> <p>Pringle said the chain's “fresh beef” was “a key point of differentiation between us and, let's say, the other guys”.</p> <p>The UK has attracted several international fast food groups including Wendy's, the US chicken chain Popeyes and the Asian fast food group Jollibee during the pandemic. Out of all European countries, the UK shows the most interest in fast food online, according to a study of Google search trends by the kitchen equipment supplier Maxima this month.</p> <p>Peter Backman, an independent food industry analyst, said he was “sceptical” about Wendy's ability to succeed in the UK. “Whenever a burger chain comes over here they always talk about the quality of their beef. That might have resonance in the States but it doesn't really over here. People expect to be served reasonable stuff and on the other hand they are sceptical that a burger they get from a quick service will be high quality.”</p><p>Source: Alice Hancock 2021 'Wendy's readies European push as UK relaunch exceeds expectations' FT.com 25 November.
