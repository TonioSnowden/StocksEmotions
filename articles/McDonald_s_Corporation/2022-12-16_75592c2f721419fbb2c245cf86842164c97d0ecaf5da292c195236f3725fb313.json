  "title": "FIFA rebuffed Zelensky's offer to share message of world peace at World Cup final, report says; World soccer's governing body FIFA rebuffed an offer from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to share a message of world peace at the World Cup final, according to a CNN report.",
  "text": "<p>The source told CNN that Zelensky's office was surprised by the negative response. It's unclear if the message would be live, or taped, the report said. \"We thought FIFA wanted to use its platform for the greater good,\" the source told CNN, but noted that talks between Ukraine and FIFA are still underway.</p><p>See:  Qatar World Cup controversy means sponsors are walking a tightrope</p><p>MarketWatch has reached out to FIFA and Zelensky's office with a request for comment on this story.</p><p>Since Russia launched its deadly invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, Zelensky has used high-profile video link addresses to rally international support for his embattled nation. These have included addresses to the U.N. General Assembly, Congress, Britain's House of Commons, the German Bundestag, the European Parliament, and the G20 Summit, as well as video link appearances at the Grammys and the Cannes Film Festival.</p><p>The last World Cup was held in Russia, with Russian President Vladimir Putin in attendance as France defeated Croatia 4-2 in the final.</p><p>Now read: British band the Farm blocks McDonald's from using hit song in Qatar World Cup ad</p><p>The 2022 tournament is perhaps the most controversial in World Cup history, with Qatar — tapped as 2022 host on the same December day in 2010 as Russia was picked to host the 2018 tournament — facing a barrage of criticism over its treatment of migrant workers and approach to LGBTQ+ rights in the country.</p><p>The criticism of Qatar, which is the first Arab nation to host a World Cup, reached a crescendo before the tournament kicked off last month. During a press conference on the eve of the opening game, FIFA president Gianni Infantino launched into a lengthy defense of the decision to host the World Cup in Qatar, and accused the West of \"hypocrisy.\"</p><p>The Qatar World Cup is also the first to take place in the northern hemisphere's winter. Traditionally, the tournament takes place in June and July, but this year's tournament was moved to avoid Qatar's searing heat.</p><p>See Now: For Budweiser, Qatar World Cup has been a tale of tough logistics and quick thinking</p><p>Branding experts have warned that the controversial Qatar World Cup poses challenges for the big-name corporations involved in the event. FIFA's list of partners includes U.S. corporate titans Coca-Cola Co. KO and Visa Inc. V, who are both involved in the Qatar event. McDonald's Corp. MCD and Crypto.com are also World Cup sponsors.</p><p>The tournament's beer sponsor Budweiser, which is owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev BUD , has had a particularly eventful few weeks in Qatar. In an abrupt reversal just two days before the soccer showpiece kicked off last month, Qatar World Cup organizers banned beer sales in the tournament's eight stadiums.</p><p>The reversal of that decision appeared to take Budweiser by surprise, with the company reportedly tweeting \"Well, this is awkward …\" before deleting the post. Budweiser quickly shrugged off the beer ban and promised a huge victory party for the country that wins the soccer showpiece.</p><p>Could Qatar's 'reusable' World Cup stadium end up in Uruguay? There are some amazing plans for tournament venues.</p><p>Fox Sports, which is owned by Fox Corp.
