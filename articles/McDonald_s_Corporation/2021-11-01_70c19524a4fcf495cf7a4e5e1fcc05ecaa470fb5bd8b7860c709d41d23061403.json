  "title": "Arby's new sandwich goes toe-to-toe with a cult classic: McDonald's McRib",
  "text": "<p>The privately held chain, best known for menu items like roast-beef sandwiches, curly fries and the Jamocha shake, recently rolled out a Country Style Pork Rib sandwich as a limited-time fall offering. There's no mistaking what it's about: a direct challenge to McDonald's McRib — the ultimate exemplar of a popular menu item that returns with sudden fanfare, only to suddenly disappear.</p><p>Indeed, the McRib, which is returning once again this fall, has become more than a menu item. It's a cultural icon — an oblong-shaped sandwich with a boneless pork patty, designed to look like a set of ribs, as its star. Homer Simpson sang its praises (well, it was referred to as a Ribwich in the “The Simpsons” episode, but you get the point). Marketers have marveled how it became so popular (“the first viral fast-food phenomenon,” as it once was dubbed).</p><p>And ultimately, people just keep gobbling it up: A Wall Street Journal story once noted that McDonald's sold more than 60 million of the sandwiches over a three-year period — in spite of the fact it's available in such limited fashion.</p><p>See also:McDonald's put a McRib NFT on the menu for $20 — here's how to get one</p><p>Arby's appears to be doing two things with its challenger of a sandwich. First, it's asserting that it can have some fun with the competition: Just look at this commercial that mocks the McRib at every turn, calling it a “hilarious” bite. In the process, Arby's is playing up the lighthearted approach exemplified by its “We have the meats” branding.</p><p>But the chain is also trying to make the point that it aims to up what we think of as fast food — its devotees sometimes refer to it as America's most underrated fast-food chain — and it can do so with a sandwich that has real barbecue pork, as in actual pieces of smoked meat. Or as Arby's marketing executive Patrick Schwing told me: “We want someone to drive through the drive-through and say, ‘I can't believe I got this from a drive-through.'”</p><p>There's just one problem from my food-critic vantage point: As much as I hate to admit it, I, too, like the McRib (more on that later).</p><p>Mind you, I like Arby's new sandwich in some respects. It does have the meat — decent-size slabs of pork shoulder (not quite “ribs,” but close enough). And the meat tells us it's been smoked: Even before I knew the exact details behind the sandwich — I learned the pork comes via Sadler's, an East Texas smokehouse — I could tell this was the genuine thing just from its deep, kissed-by-burning-wood flavor. If anything, the sandwich suffers from being too smoky taste-wise.</p><p>The real issue, however, is that Arby's doesn't quite offset that smokiness in the right way. The sandwich is a heavy affair with its toppings of smoked gouda cheese, fried onion strings, mayo and barbecue sauce. (It's also a bit heavy in the nutrition department, with 500 calories, 23 grams of fat and 1,450 milligrams of sodium.) What it needs is something vinegar-y or crunchy to balance things out — say, pickles or raw onions (or perhaps pickled onions).</p><p>Meanwhile, there's the McRib, now in its 40 year of making occasional appearances on the Golden Arches menu. Let's be honest: This is more Frankenfood than real food. There's something unholy about pork that has been ground up and molded to resemble, well, a piece of pork. But McDonald's didn't get where it was without making things taste delicious (and, yes, without having a smart marketing strategy — would we care as much about the McRib if it was available all the time?). For its part, McDonald's didn't respond to a request for comment about its take on Arby's offering a competing sandwich, though it referred to a press release that touted the McRib as “tangy and tantalizing.”</p><p>The corporate hyperbole notwithstanding, the description isn't too far off the mark. What the McDonald's sandwich does is trick your taste buds in a beguiling way. The patty is like a beef hamburger, yet it's not — the flavor is a bit like that of a yummy pork breakfast sausage. And there's the barbecue sauce — way too sweet (and way too generously slathered on), but it somehow adds to the craveable factor (we're a nation that loves sugar, after all). And oh yeah, McDonald's put pickles and onions on its rib sandwich — smart move.</p><p>Ironically, Arby's may be helping McDonald's at its own game, says veteran fast-food analyst Mark Kalinowski. That is, it's giving McDonald's “a little bit of free publicity,” he says, even as it pokes fun of the McRib.</p><p>Ultimately, I say there may be room in the fast-food market for more than one rib sandwich — after all, there's room for gazillions of burgers. And this could be a case of different strokes for different folks: If you want real smoked meat, Arby's is clearly the place to go. If you want a porky, sweet sensation, make it McDonald's — while the McRib is still available, of course.</p>",
