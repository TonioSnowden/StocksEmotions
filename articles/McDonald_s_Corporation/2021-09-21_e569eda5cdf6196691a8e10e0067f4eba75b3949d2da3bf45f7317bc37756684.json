  "title": "McDonald's Plans to Make Happy Meal Toys More Sustainable; The fast-food chain is shifting some of its toys to plant-based materials, and the new toys will begin appearing in the U.S. in January",
  "text": "<p>\"Our entire supply chain has had to change with this,\" said Amy Murray, vice president of global marketing enablement. \"It has been a massive undertaking.\"</p><p>McDonald's is a big player in the toy market, purchasing around a billion toys a year globally for Happy Meals, the company said. The toys will cost the same for restaurant franchisees as those currently sold, according to McDonald's.</p><p>Companies from oil giants to food businesses have faced pressure to make their operations greener or focus more on climate-friendly endeavors. And investors, in some cases, have been the ones pushing for companies to do so.</p><p>Mondelez International Inc., maker of Chips Ahoy! cookies and Ritz crackers, a few years ago said all of its wrappers would be recyclable by 2025. Investors had pressured the company several years earlier to look at its packaging's environmental impact.</p><p>But as companies have touted their sustainable efforts, some have been accused of \"greenwashing\" or making deceptive environmental or social claims.</p><p>McDonald's said its effort would result in a roughly 90% reduction in virgin fossil fuel-based plastic use compared with 2018 levels, or the equivalent to more than 650,000 people eliminating plastics from their lives each year.</p><p>The company said it tested the new toys with children and restaurant owners, and families support their efforts to wean off plastics.</p><p>\"All our franchisees and customers see what's happening in the world,\" Ms. Murray said. \"They really want McDonald's to be relevant in the future.\"</p><p>McDonald's Plans to Make Happy Meal Toys More Sustainable</p>",
