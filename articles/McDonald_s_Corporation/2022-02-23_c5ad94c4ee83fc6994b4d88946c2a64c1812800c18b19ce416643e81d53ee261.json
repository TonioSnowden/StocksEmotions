  "title": "At Last, a Businessman Biden Can Blame for Raising Prices; Billionaire Carl Icahn ramps up his campaign against McDonald's.",
  "text": "<p>Carl Icahn has launched a proxy fight for two board seats at McDonald's Corp., as the activist investor pushes the fast-food chain to require its suppliers to change their treatment of pigs.</p><p>Mr. Icahn has a very small McDonald's stake and had been in talks with the company alongside the Humane Society of the United States for several weeks...</p><p>After the Journal reported Sunday that Mr. Icahn had nominated two directors, McDonald's confirmed it in a statement and said the board would evaluate his nominees.</p><p>For consumers who treasure breakfast bargains, there remains the hope that Mr. Icahn is merely engaged in a standard Manhattan charity-dinner virtue signal. Ms. Lombardo reports:</p><p>McDonald's said Mr. Icahn reported owning roughly 200 McDonald's shares—or about $50,000 worth. He typically takes stakes worth hundreds of millions of dollars in companies he targets . . . McDonald's in its statement Sunday also noted that Mr. Icahn is a majority owner of Viskase Cos., a company which makes among other things casings for sausages. It questioned why Mr. Icahn hasn't publicly called on it to adopt similar commitments to McDonald's.</p><p>The company's response also argues thatit has been leading the industry in moving toward more space for pregnant sows, and suggests that Mr. Icahn and the Humane Society have been demanding still more:</p><p>By the end of 2022, the Company expects to source 85% to 90% of its U.S. pork volumes from sows not housed in gestation crates during pregnancy. Despite industry-wide challenges for farmer and producers, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and global swine disease outbreaks, the Company expects 100% of its U.S. pork will come from sows housed in groups during pregnancy by the end of 2024 . . .</p><p>Despite McDonald's progress, Mr. Icahn has instead asked for new commitments, including to require all of McDonald's U.S. pork suppliers to move to \"crate free\" pork, and set specific timeframes for doing so. While the Company looks forward to promoting further collaboration across the industry on this issue, the current pork supply in the U.S. would make this type of commitment impossible. Furthermore, it reflects a departure from the veterinary science used for large-scale production throughout the industry, and would harm the Company's shared pursuit of providing customers with high quality products at accessible prices.</p><p>With inflation soaring recently to its highest level in 40 years, there could not be a worse time for McDonald's franchisees and customers to absorb another cost driver.</p><p>But for President Joe Biden, Mr. Icahn's new play for board seats represents perfect timing. The President has been catching flak from economic luminaries in his own party for his innumerate suggestionsthat businesspeople are to blame for Washington-made inflation.</p><p>Now we have a prominent capitalist raising his hand and seeking to force expensive changes that shareholders have not approved and that many customers surely will not like. Perhaps Mr. Biden should use his bully pulpit to oppose all political agendas that threaten the affordability of the beloved McMuffin.</p><p>***</p><p>In Other News</p><p>Meanwhile at the National Institutes of Health</p><p>Sharon Lerner writes at the Intercept:</p><p>This week, in response to ongoing litigation over public records related to coronavirus research funded by the federal agency, the NIH sent The Intercept 292 fully redacted pages rather than substantive material that could help us understand how the virus first came to infect humans . . . the most recent batch of documents, which the NIH sent The Intercept on Tuesday, underscores an ongoing lack of transparency at the agency. Even as members of Congress and scientists call for additional information that could shed light on the origins of the pandemic, 292 of 314 pages — more than 90 percent of the current release — were completely redacted . . . The remaining pages also contain significant redactions.</p><p>***</p><p>This Could Get Out of Hand Iris Samuels reports in the Anchorage Daily News:</p><p>An Alaska lawmaker is proposing retaliatory taxes on fish and oil exported from Alaska to Washington State after Washington lawmakers unveiled a plan to levy a 6-cent-per-gallon tax on fuel refined in Washington and exported to neighboring states.</p><p>\"Frankly, I'm tired of being thought of as a Washington colony,\" Rep. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, said on the House floor last week. \"I'm tired of them depending on us and taxing us for their needs and ignoring ours.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Just Asking \"Georgia man asks cops to let him 'smoke a joint' before going to jail,\" Macon Telegraph, Feb. 18</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.
