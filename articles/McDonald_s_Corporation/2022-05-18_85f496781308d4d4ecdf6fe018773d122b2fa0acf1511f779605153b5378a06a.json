  "text": "<p>The results in North Carolina showed both the power and limits to former President Donald Trump's ability to shape his party's future. His endorsement gave Mr. Budd a boost but couldn't save Mr. Cawthorn after a series of missteps that had cost the 26-year-old freshman support from a range of voters and local GOP leaders.</p><p>Mr. Trump's influence was being tested in several other Republican primaries on Tuesday. In Pennsylvania, his favored candidate for governor, state Sen. Doug Mastriano, won the party nomination to succeed Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, who is term-limited.</p><p>Mr. Trump's endorsed Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, was in a neck-and-neck contest in partial vote tallies with David McCormick, the former chief executive of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund. Kathy Barnette, a conservative commentator, made a late surge in opinion polls, but she trailed substantially behind the two front-runners.</p><p>Pennsylvania and North Carolina will be battlegrounds in November for control of the Senate, where each party now holds 50 seats and Democrats run the chamber because Vice President Kamala Harris can break ties.</p><p>Mr. Fetterman's victory over Rep. Conor Lamb, called by the Associated Press, occurred on a day when he also underwent a procedure to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator. His campaign said that the surgery, which came after Mr. Fetterman was hospitalized for a stroke Friday, was successful and that he was recovering well.</p><p>The Pennsylvania Senate race likely offers Democrats their best opportunity to pick up a seat now held by a Republican, as the current officeholder, Sen. Pat Toomey, is the only Republican senator retiring in a state President Biden carried in 2020.</p><p>Rep. Budd's victory in North Carolina, which was called by the AP, showed that Republican voters have remained loyal to Mr. Trump. His closest opponent, former Gov. Pat McCrory, had pursued a conservative course when he led the state, signing tax cuts into law and backing a \"bathroom bill\"\" that restricted access for transgender people and drew protests.</p><p>Mr. Budd will face Democrat Cheri Beasley, AP said. A former chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, she would be the third Black woman senator in history and the first Black senator from North Carolina.</p><p>Analysts predict that the race will be competitive but give Mr. Budd an edge in the November contest to succeed Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is retiring.</p><p>In western North Carolina, the AP said, Mr. Cawthorn lost to Chuck Edwards, a state senator whose business experience includes owning McDonald's franchises.</p><p>In other highlights of Tuesday's primaries, House races in Oregon and Pennsylvania were testing the power of the Democratic Party's liberal wing to overtake centrist candidates.</p><p>In Kentucky, incumbent Republicans Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Thomas Massie were renominated. The two iconoclasts have at times halted or voted against efforts to speed support to Ukraine in its defense against Russian invasion, arguing the measures risk escalating the war or wasting U.S. tax dollars.</p><p>Many states also had competitive contests for state legislative seats, mayor's offices and other posts. In Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, the state's attorney general, was unopposed for the Democratic nomination for governor. He will face Mr. Mastriano, a leading figure in pushing the state to review Mr. Biden's victory in the state's 2020 vote count over Mr. Trump.</p><p>In Idaho, Republican Gov. Brad Little was seeking a second term, but Mr. Trump had endorsed his challenger, the current lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin, who twice issued executive orders to loosen Covid-19 regulations while Mr. Little was out of state. Both were later reversed.</p><p>Democratic voters in several races had a choice between candidates aligned with the centrist and liberal wings.</p><p>In Oregon, Rep. Kurt Schrader, a member of the centrist group known as Blue Dog Democrats, was running for an eighth term. His challenger, Jamie McLeod-Skinner, was running to his political left. Mr. Schrader has drawn protests from his party's liberal wing for several actions in the current Congress.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
