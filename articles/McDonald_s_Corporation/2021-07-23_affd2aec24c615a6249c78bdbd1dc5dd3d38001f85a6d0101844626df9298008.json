  "title": "Sports:  Cyclists Make a Mad Dash to Tokyo  ---  After finishing the grueling Tour de France, dozens of riders scrambled to make their Olympic flight  ----  By Joshua Robinson",
  "text": "<p>   Paris -- Wout Van Aert was clearly in a hurry. As the Belgian cyclist tore up the Champs-Elysees and muscled his way across the finish line on Sunday, he became the first rider to be officially done with this year's Tour de France. </p><p>   With victory on the legendary stage to Paris behind him, Van Aert could then concentrate on the tightest turnaround of his summer: racing to the airport for a flight to the Tokyo Olympics. There was just one problem. Finishing first was in fact the surest way to be late. </p><p>   \"I guess I made myself in trouble,\" he said during the winner's mandatory press conference. \"I have to catch a flight tonight and all these interviews will take quite a while.\" </p><p>   Van Aert was one of more than a dozen riders in the Tour executing the high-wire sprint from a stage that finished shortly after 7 p.m. to an 11:25 p.m. Air France flight to Tokyo departing from the opposite side of Paris. </p><p>   Even for teams used to shuttling riders and bikes to races around the globe, Sunday was a hell-for-leather run. And just like in bike racing, no marginal gain was too small. </p><p>   \"We were gaining time everywhere we could,\" said Richard Plugge, the director of Van Aert's Jumbo-Visma team. \"It was quite a scramble.\" </p><p>   The journey to Tokyo has been an ordeal for everyone associated with the Olympics, including mountains of paperwork and endless Covid-19 tests. But few made it harder on themselves than Tour cyclists. The drill went: pedal through France for three weeks, snap a quick photo of the Arc de Triomphe, get on a plane to Japan. </p><p>   If you were lucky, you had time for a glass of Champagne. If you were Van Aert, you settled for a podium presentation, a couple of minutes with your wife and baby son, and then some chicken and rice or an omelet in the back of a car to the airport. \"Just so he didn't have to eat McDonald's in the airport,\" Plugge said. </p><p>   Somewhere in there, you also try to find room to clean up on the team bus, which is fitted with a shower smaller than an airplane bathroom. When Van Aert emerged, he changed into his Belgian national team kit and found a van with his Olympic bikes all packed and ready to fly. </p><p>   At the same moment, similar scenes played out up and down the Champs-Elysees. Denmark's Michael Valgren, of team EF Education-Nippo, was breaking down his bike and jamming into a box for Tokyo right on the street. And the three Olympians at Team AG2R Citroen, which included Rio gold medalist Greg Van Avermaet, made just enough time for a Champagne toast before hitting the road. </p><p>   But none had a smoother ride than the Tour's hometown favorites. </p><p>   Led by Team Cofidis' Guillaume Martin, the French Olympic quintet had the full force of the race organizers behind it. Martin dropped some luggage with his parents at the finish line, then picked up a suitcase that the national team had waiting for him. After a couple slices of pizza, he boarded a bus with four other compatriots, collected his business class ticket, and settled in for an express ride to Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport. </p><p>   The Tour had even arranged a police escort. </p><p>   Martin's Cofidis teammate Simon Geschke wasn't as efficient. The German delegation had been unable to book him on the Sunday night flight, leaving him to travel to Japan on Monday. </p><p>   The upside of such a frantic dash is that riders feeling good in the race's final week can carry that form straight into the Games, where the men's road race is Saturday with a 145-mile course featuring a climb up Mount Fuji. </p><p>   \"I really think that coming out of the Tour de France is the best way to perform a week later,\" Martin said. </p><p>   That's good news for Van Aert, who is in flying form after one of the most stunning Tour performances in recent memory. </p><p>   Even though modern cycling is supposed to be about specialization, he proved that the right, supremely gifted rider could be competitive on any type of terrain. Van Aert finished the race with victories in a bunch sprint, a time-trial, and a mountain stage. </p><p>   \"Actually, I can't believe it,\" he said. \"To finish with three victories in my pocket is just out of my expectations.\" </p><p>   Van Aert was even less sure of what to expect from his 6,000-mile trip from the Tour bubble to the Olympic bubble. His nostrils had been swabbed more times than he could remember to pass the various Covid-19 tests and he downloaded all the apps, QR codes, and other documentation required to enter Japan. </p><p>   Like everyone else inbound for Tokyo, Van Aert knew how much could still go wrong. </p><p>   But the sprint after the sprint -- the Champs to Charles de Gaulle -- wasn't one of them. </p><p>   Some 16 hours after the end of Stage 21, a peloton of bleary-eyed cyclists re-formed for an unlikely Stage 22: baggage claim of Tokyo's Haneda Airport. </p><p></p>",
