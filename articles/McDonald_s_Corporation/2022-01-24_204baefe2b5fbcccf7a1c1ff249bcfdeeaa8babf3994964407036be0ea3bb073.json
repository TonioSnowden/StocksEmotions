  "text": "<p>Nayib Bukele changed his Twitter profile to that of a McDonald's employee, in wake of the latest plunge in bitcoin that brought the cryptocurrency down as much as 50% from its highs.</p><p>https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1485031106982428677That's a reference to an internet meme, where HODL'ers indicate their future career prospects when bitcoin slumps. McDonald's pays as low as $11 per hour.</p><p>Bitcoin BTCUSD was relatively stable on Monday after a turbulent weekend, trading above $35,000 , a far cry from the roughly $69,000 it was trading at in early November.</p><p>Under Bukele's direction, El Salvador has been buying bitcoin, and uniquely has adopted it as legal tender. Coindesk reports the country now holds over 1,500 bitcoin, worth some $53 million in fiat Yankee dollars.</p><p>Financial markets have not been impressed. Since El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender, its 5-year credit default swaps have surged to 1,812.81 , from 412.54, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>",
