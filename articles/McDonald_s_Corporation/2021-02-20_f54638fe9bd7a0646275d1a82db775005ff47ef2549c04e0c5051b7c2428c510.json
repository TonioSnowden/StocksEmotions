  "text": "<p>S. Prestley Blake, who co-founded the Friendly's restaurant chain in 1935, never hesitated to introduce himself to more famous people. Seeking business advice, he called on James Cash Penney at the retailer's office in New York and Harlow Curtice, a former president of General Motors, in Michigan.</p><p>Ray Kroc, who later made McDonald's a global chain, sold milkshake equipment to Mr. Blake in the early 1950s. The two men stayed in touch to \"swap war stories about the food business,\" as Mr. Blake put it. In the 1960s, he traveled to Sikkim, then a Himalayan protectorate of India, to meet Hope Cooke, an American who married into royalty there.</p><p>\"Don't be afraid to ask other people for advice,\" he advised in \"A Friendly Life,\" his 2011 memoir.</p><p>He and his younger brother, Curtis, natives of Springfield, Mass., built a chain of more than 600family-style restaurants, mostly in the Northeast. In 1979, they sold it to Hershey Foods Corp. for $162 million. After Hershey sold the business in 1988, Prestley Blake accused the new owners of mismanaging the chain and waged a court battle against them. Recently sold again, to Amici Partners Group, the chain now has about 130 restaurants.</p><p>Prestley Blake died Feb. 11 at the age of 106. His brother, Curtis, died in 2019, at age 102.</p><p>In retirement, Prestley collected Rolls-Royce cars and built a replica of Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's mansion, in Somers, Conn.</p>",
