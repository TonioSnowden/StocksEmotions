  "text": "<p>For roughly half a century a segment of the food industry has been trying to persuade consumers to give up beef. Will the movement finally succeed? History says no, but some investors seem to believe that this time is different.</p><p>Their belief fueled an astonishing first-day gain of 163% in the company's shares back in May of 2019. The amazing rally continued into July of that year and after some thrilling ups and downs since then, the shares are now bouncing around the price of the initial offering, down close to 90% from the high. The Journal's Sam Goldfarb reports that the trading in convertible bonds of some companies is \"sending a warning signal\" and notes:</p><p>Based on where their bonds trade, cash-burning companies such as the plant-based protein company Beyond Meat, or real-estate broker Redfin Corp., are facing serious financial stress and pressure to start generating positive free cash flow, some investors said.</p><p>Beyond Meat has a $1.2 billion bond trading at around 40 cents on the dollar...</p><p>That hurts and it must come as quite a shock to some consumers of plant-based newspapers. Why, it was only in March of this year that a New York Times headline expressed such confidence that we were approaching the \"End of Beef\" that it proceeded directly to the question of what this event would mean for \"Our Sense of Self.\"</p><p>Many selves have long sensed that beef is delicious. But Ligaya Mishan wrote for the Times:</p><p>Nearly a fourth of Americans claimed to have eaten less meat in 2019, according to a Gallup poll. The recipe site Epicurious, which reaches an audience of 10 million, phased out beef as an ingredient in new recipes in 2020. Diners at some McDonald's can now sate their lust for a Quarter Pounder with a vegan McPlant instead. Faux meat products are projected to reach $85 billion in sales by 2030, according to a recent study by UBS, and Tyson Foods, one of the biggest beef packers in the United States, has hedged its bets by introducing its own plant-based line.</p><p>We can't help but wonder how many Americans claim to want a McPlant. All we can say for sure is that they haven't been ordering many. Just three weeks after the Times wrote about the \"end of beef\" and pondered the impact on ourselves, Tonya Garcia reported for MarketWatch:</p><p>BTIG analysts conducted channel checks at locations that are participating in the McDonald's Corp. test of the McPlant sandwich and say the plant-based sandwich, created in partnership with Beyond Meat Inc., isn't meeting expectations.</p><p>\"[F]ranchisee sentiment on the sales performance was underwhelming,\" wrote analysts led by Peter Saleh in a note...</p><p>\"We believe McDonald's may continue to test and even offer McPlant in higher income, urban markets that appear more receptive to plant-based meat offerings, but a wide-scale launch seems a ways off at this point,\" the note said.</p><p>It seems that franchisees were developing a sense that customers prefer beef. In fairness, the Beyond Meat executive team should not doubt themselves, because the problem is bigger than their company.</p><p>Kellogg Co. recently decided to jettison its plant-based foods division. Jessica DiNapoli and Hilary Russ of Reuters report that \"overall sales of meat alternatives have flattened\" and add:</p><p>MorningStar - a staple for frozen vegetarian food like Garden Veggie Burgers for decades - launched its meat-like product, Incogmeato, in 2019 to compete directly with Beyond and Impossible.</p><p>But it hasn't had the \"strongest launch,\" said John Baumgartner, senior consumer equity research analyst at Mizuho Securities. Now, consumers' appetite for plant-based burgers has cooled as new options flood the market.</p><p>\"It's a tough environment right now,\" Baumgartner said. \"The category is not going to grow as quickly as the early bulls anticipated. Volume is down.\"</p><p>The Reuters crew reports on Kellogg CEO Steve Cahillane and notes:</p><p>On a call with analysts last month, Cahillane said there had been \"irrational exuberance\" in meat alternatives generally.</p><p>\"The vegebubble is turning to vege-bust\" is the headline on a piece from Matthew Lynn in the U.K.'s Telegraph newspaper. He writes:</p><p>At one point the hoopla around plant-based meats made the dotcom bubble of the turn of the century look rational by comparison...</p><p>What went wrong? ... most of the meat and fish alternatives on the market so far are relatively expensive... When the economy was booming, jobs were plentiful, and real wages were rising, that was not a huge problem. Now that inflation is rampant, and food inflation most of all, it is a very different story... Meanwhile, there was no real evidence that plant burgers and fake chicken were healthier...</p><p>Perhaps one could write an entire book on this recent mania for fake meat and the customers who still largely reject it:</p><p>Our Burgers, Ourselves.</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Lisa Rossi helps compile Best of the Web.)</p><p>'Irrational Exuberance' on a Plate</p>",
