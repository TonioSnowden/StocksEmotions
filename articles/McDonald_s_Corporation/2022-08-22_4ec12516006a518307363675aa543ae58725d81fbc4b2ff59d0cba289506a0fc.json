  "text": "<p>Ms. Penrose's departure comes months after her seat on the McDonald's board was challenged by activist investor Carl Icahn, who criticized the fast-food chain over its suppliers' treatment of pregnant pigs. At the time, Mr. Icahn also targeted a seat held by Richard Lenny, the former chief executive of Hershey Co.</p><p>McDonald's Chairman Enrique Hernandez Jr. said Monday that Ms. Penrose has overseen the company's progress on climate, responsible sourcing and diversity, equity and inclusion goals.</p><p>\"We are grateful for all that she has done for McDonald's and the communities we serve,\" he said.</p><p>McDonald's said it has elected Marriott CEO Tony Capuano, J&amp;J Worldwide Chair of Pharmaceuticals Jennifer Taubert and Salesforce Chief Financial Officer Amy Weaver to the board effective Oct. 1.</p><p>The new additions increase the size of the board to 14, and increase the number of women on the board from three, including Ms. Penrose, to four.</p><p>The move also comes after executives warned last month that the business outlook remains uncertain amid inflation and weakening consumer sentiment.</p><p>McDonald's said last month that for the recently ended quarter, higher prices and value-menu offerings pushed same-store sales up 3.7% in the U.S. from a year earlier, outpacing analysts' expectations. Overall revenue, though, fell 3%, mostly because of the stronger U.S. dollar.</p><p>Write to Will Feuer at will.feuer@wsj.com</p><p>McDonald's Overhauls Board After Carl Icahn's Challenge</p>",
