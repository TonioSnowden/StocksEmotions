So what have we learned?</p> <p>For <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18cfeb9a-8596-4d23-badd-df9a62d510ab\">Big Tech</a>, it appears, the only way is up. It comes as no surprise that the sector profited handsomely during the crisis as lockdowns fuelled the shift to digital, whether for work, entertainment, news or for mundane everyday tasks such as buying groceries. What is exciting companies (and investors) more is the belief that many of those newly acquired habits are here to stay.</p> <p>The combined after-tax profits of <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Alphabet</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> hit $57bn, double the previous year and 30 per cent more than Wall Street had predicted, while sales at <strong>Shopify</strong>, whose software is used to run online stores and process payments, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbfb97ff-5c64-4093-9bb8-73e5f395510a#post-a9ceeada-cf33-42a0-ab13-8374ebf8d0b9\">passed $1bn for the first time</a>, rising 57 per cent year on year. Earnings from <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Amazon</strong> are still to come. </p> <p>Although the big jumps in profits will intensify efforts from regulators to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4db3aec8-b30f-4d97-84f9-ff9ffe1d2ff2\">curb Big Tech's growing power</a>, the opportunities, summed up by Microsoft chief Satya Nadella, are vast: “Five per cent of world GDP is tech spending, it's projected to double — the doubling is going to happen at an accelerated rate.”</p> <p>Financial services companies too are having a moment, buoyed by the economic recovery. </p> <p><strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>, Germany's biggest lender, reported its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09a57a07-ef2a-4adb-994f-5064dd808148\">best run of profits in a decade</a>, scrapping cost-cutting targets and raising guidance for full-year revenues, aided by provisions for bad loans 50 per cent lower than forecast. <strong>Barclays</strong> in the UK was similarly able to slash the reserves it had built up against <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a14025ea-db5c-4324-a53d-d81e2e6188cf\">pandemic-related loan losses</a>, reporting net income up £90m from last year to £2.1bn, easily beating analysts' expectations. <strong>Santander</strong>, Spain's largest bank, swung back to profit, aided by the surge in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2372ebaa-d37f-4292-a207-9299e1ba1aa9\">demand for used cars in the US</a> and a booming housing market in the UK. </p> <p>Even more impressive were results from <strong>Man Group</strong>, the world's largest listed hedge fund manager, which reported first-half performance fees <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3404c4fa-5ad9-4f29-bb90-94cd3900ed7f\">10 times higher than a year ago</a>, a sign of how strongly the $4tn industry has bounced back after a turbulent 18 months in financial markets.</p> <p>It has also been a good day for Big Pharma. <strong>Pfizer</strong> raised <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee45a6f3-1577-4d64-bd1f-462c7440de38\">sales forecasts for its Covid-19 vaccine</a> by a third to $33bn as it reported a 92 per cent rise in overall sales to $19bn and an earnings per share increase of 58 per cent to 98 cents. UK drugmaker <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong>, which does not yet have an approved Covid-19 shot, benefited from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d27d95e-f7dd-489d-975e-bfebb3b281ac\">increased sales from its vaccines</a> for meningitis, diphtheria and hepatitis as disruption from the pandemic faded. </p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p>The increase in infections across the US, driven by the Delta variant, has complicated the <strong>US Federal Reserve's</strong> timetable to begin “tapering” its support for the economy. A statement follows the end of the bank's two-day policy meeting at 2pm ET today. DC bureau chief James Politi <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b5992d3-967e-4a63-b159-a398654d6199\">examines the Fed's options</a>. </p> <p>The IMF highlighted the <strong>threat to global recovery</strong> from developing countries' limited access to vaccines as it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c037438-a24c-433a-aaf9-65ebbb29faf1\">upgraded growth projections</a> for richer nations and lowered them elsewhere. “Vaccine access has emerged as the principal faultline along which the global recovery splits into two blocs,” the IMF said. The Fund still expects overall global growth of 6 per cent this year. </p> <p>Strong export demand for semiconductors, cars and ships helped the <strong>South Korean economy</strong> grow at a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a77503a9-36be-4785-9fd4-131fc6a65bbc\">record 5.9 per cent</a> in the second quarter. The outlook is less certain as the country experiences a new surge in infections and a shortage of vaccines.</p> <h1>Business</h1> <p>US aircraft manufacturer <strong>Boeing </strong>said it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3969a61c-21cd-4a90-817f-f5ab725ecee1\">cut 10,000 fewer jobs</a> than it originally anticipated at the height of the pandemic as it reported its first quarterly profit since September 2019. Net income was $567m with revenues of $17bn.</p> <p><strong>General Electric</strong>, America's best-known industrial conglomerate and seen as a bellwether for the global economy, reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6cd1da01-8fac-4faf-9403-53b5756c388e\">better than expected second-quarter results</a>, powered by strong performances in its aviation and healthcare businesses. As many companies have flagged during earnings season, rising costs remain a serious concern. </p> <p><strong>UK employer confidence</strong> is “soaring” according to a new survey, even amid the current wave of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbfb97ff-5c64-4093-9bb8-73e5f395510a#post-5aae9e8d-d9ad-413a-9365-9a091f6d0c90\">staff shortages</a>. Another report said the number of companies in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbfb97ff-5c64-4093-9bb8-73e5f395510a#post-e345347f-30a4-4b7f-bdfc-c94350d50f6c\">significant financial distress</a> had fallen from a record high earlier this year as coronavirus restrictions were lifted. Defence workers, refuse collectors, tax office staff and prison warders have been added to the list of those <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d693571b-1c6f-46d2-9599-f09f2d1a1efe\">exempt from self-isolation</a> if they are “pinged” by the NHS app telling them they have been in contact with an infected person.</p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p>A consortium of big names including former US Treasury secretaries Timothy Geithner and Larry Summers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b417310-f1b6-4f8a-af46-c55b65231ac4\">proposed sweeping changes</a> to how the Federal Reserve deals with the $22tn market for <strong>US government debt</strong>. The aim is to prevent the type of turmoil experienced in March 2020 as the pandemic exposed the fragility of the market. </p> <p>The latest manifestation of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9f38230-58a4-4728-bb1d-f993ea1ce513\">booming commodities prices</a> is a record $9.1bn dividend from <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> on the back of soaring demand for iron ore from China's recovering economy. The company's half-year profits were $2.5bn larger than Rio achieved in all of 2020. The world's top 40 miners could record after-tax profits of $118bn in 2021, up 68 per cent from the previous year, according to PwC.</p> <p>Predictions for global markets range from a “Roaring Twenties” scenario that could boost equities markets to runaway inflation that could hurt stock and bond prices. <strong>Wei Li</strong>, global chief investment strategist at the BlackRock Investment Institute, argues in the FT that investors should keep a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6aa9a7f-195a-4b23-803b-839d2d868ab4\">strong focus on equities</a> during this unprecedented era of turbulence.</p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p><em>Scourge of the Economists</em> comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3250c4e8-1746-4286-979c-aa1739742366?commentID=b59589f0-2591-4127-9aa9-3e0ac627d1f1\">Let competitive forces fly in the airline recovery</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>The airline industry has always been a bonfire of investors' capital and government grants. That's not necessarily wrong — many forms of transport receive explicit or implicit state subsidy. However, the problem now is that we need to cut back greenhouse gas emissions very quickly and airlines depend on fossil fuels for now. That should have been a reason to withhold subsidy during the pandemic and let the airline industry go under. Trains are perfectly usable for most journeys. </p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>What are the world's top fashion designers, film directors, food writers and musicians reading and listening to?
