  "text": "<p>   McDonald's Corp. said it would offer $250 million in low-interest loans to new franchisees over the next five years as a way to help increase diverse ownership of its U.S. restaurants. </p><p>   \"We must challenge ourselves, even more, to invest in the future,\" McDonald's Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said Wednesday. </p><p>   Blacks, Hispanics and Asians accounted for 29.6% of all U.S. franchisees as of the end of 2020, while women made up 28.9% of domestic owners, McDonald's said. The company counted more than 2,400 U.S. restaurant owners as of the end of last year. </p><p>   McDonald's recently has put more focus on racial inclusion among its employees, franchisees and suppliers. The company this year tied executives' annual incentives to increasing the share of women and racial minorities in leadership roles by 2025. </p><p>   The fast-food company has received criticism from some local lawmakers and former franchisees over racial matters. Last year, McDonald's was sued by Black ex-owners, who accused the company of selling them subpar restaurants. The company's approach caused the number of Black owners in the U.S. to fall, the owners alleged. </p><p>   In its legal rebuttal, McDonald's said that it wasn't in the company's interest to have its franchisees fail and that it provides extensive resources to its owners to succeed in their businesses. </p><p>   Mr. Kempczinski in November apologized for a text to Chicago's mayor regarding the shooting deaths of two Chicago children, which critics called racially insensitive. Mr. Kempczinski has said the comments were wrong. </p><p></p>",
