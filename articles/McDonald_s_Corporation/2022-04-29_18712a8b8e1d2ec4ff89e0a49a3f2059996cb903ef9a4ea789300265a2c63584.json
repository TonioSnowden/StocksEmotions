  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 climbed 103.54 points, or 2.5%, to 4287.50, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 614.46 points, or 1.8%, to 33916.39.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 2.862% from 2.817% Wednesday. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Oil prices climbed, sending shares of energy companies higher, as government officials in Germany said the country is ready to stop buying Russian oil. Benchmark Brent oil rose 2.2% to $107.59 a barrel.</p><p>Traders said the stock market was poised for a rally following recent selloffs in tech stocks, including a big swoon earlier in April after Netflix earnings disappointed investors. With little visibility over how higher interest rates will filter through the wider economy, money managers say trading has been thin and prone to whipsaw moves in both directions.</p><p>\"Nothing goes down in a straight line and nothing goes up in a straight line,\" said Michael Antonelli, managing director and market strategist at Baird. \"You don't need a lot to move the stock market when everyone's this pessimistic.\"</p><p>Friday may bring a quick reversal to the tech sector's gains if aftermarket trading is any indication. Shares of Amazon.com fell 11% in late trading after the company posted its first quarterly loss since 2015 as sales growth slowed. Intel's stock fell 3.4% after hours as the company reported a decrease in quarterly earnings and lower demand for personal computers.</p><p>Apple shares fell 1.1% after hours. The iPhone maker posted stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue, and Chief Executive Tim Cook said supply constraints were lower than the December quarter.</p><p>While Thursday's gains for Meta's stock and technology more broadly were substantial, they pale in comparison to earlier-year losses. Meta's stock remains down roughly 39% this year, and the tech sector in the S&amp;P 500 is off nearly 15% from where it closed out 2021. In this month alone, inflation fears, worries about profit growth and turmoil overseas sent stocks tumbling.</p><p>Stock-market volatility hasn't been sustained at such a high level since the 2008 financial crisis, with the exception of the start of the pandemic, said John Roe, head of multiasset funds at Legal &amp; General Investment Management. Bond volatility is the highest since the financial crisis, he added.</p><p>Twitter shares rose 47 cents, or 1%, to $49.11 after the social-media company posted higher revenue and withdrew financial guidance ahead of its acquisition by Elon Musk. Southwest Airlines rose 96 cents, or 2.1%, to $46.90 on forecasts that the airline will turn a profit for the rest of the year.</p><p>Caterpillar shares fell $1.52, or 0.7%, to $212.44 after the industrial bellwether said margins fell in the first quarter. McDonald's said profit was higher than analysts had expected, pushing shares up $7.05, or 2.9%, to $254.19.</p><p>On the economic front, data showed the U.S. economy shrank at a 1.4% annual rate in the first quarter, its first contraction since the pandemic. Though the rate of decline is worrisome, some analysts said they aren't anticipating a recession given the underlying data. A big driver in the decline was a widening trade deficit, meaning the U.S. imported far more than it exported. Consumer spending also rose, a slight acceleration from the end of last year.</p><p>Overseas markets rallied. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.6% on strong earnings reports.</p><p>Chinese markets regained their footing after tumbling on concerns that lockdowns in major cities would slow growth in the world's second-largest economy. The Shanghai Composite Index edged up 0.6%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.7%. Early Friday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 0.8%.</p><p>The Nikkei 225 gained 1.7% Thursday after the Bank of Japan reinforced its commitment to low interest rates despite rising inflation. The central bank said it would purchase 10-year Japanese government bonds at a yield of 0.25% every business day. Japanese markets are closed Friday for a holiday.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
