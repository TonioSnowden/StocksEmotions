  "title": "Carl Icahn Targets Kroger Over Pork, CEO Pay; Billionaire investor seeks two board seats, broadening push to change how hogs are housed",
  "text": "<p>\"I remain very troubled by the glaring oversight of needless distress caused by your company's policies,\" Mr. Icahn wrote in the letter.</p><p>Kroger, the biggest U.S. supermarket operator in terms of sales, said in a statement that it isn't directly involved in the raising or processing of any animals but that it regularly engages with advocacy groups and its suppliers to understand animal-welfare topics.</p><p>The company said its executive compensation is aligned with shareholders' interests and mostly based on performance. Kroger said it has raised the average employee wage by 25% to $17 an hour over the past four years.</p><p>In its May 2021 proxy statement, Kroger reported that Mr. McMullen had an annual compensation of more than $22 million, while the median employee earned $24,617 in 2020.</p><p>The letter broadens Mr. Icahn's efforts to eliminate the use of gestation stalls, small crates that prevent breeding pigs, or sows, from turning around or interacting with other hogs on farms. Last month Mr. Icahn launched a proxy fight for two board seats at McDonald's Corp., pushing the burger giant to require its own suppliers to change their treatment of sows.</p><p>The use of gestation stalls is at the center of a debate over how pigs in the $43 billion U.S. pork industry are housed. The state of California, animal welfare groups like the Humane Society of the United States and Mr. Icahn have all been involved in pressing pork producers, restaurants and retailers to eliminate the stalls' use, saying they cause hogs unnecessary suffering.</p><p>Pork producers and suppliers have said that moving away from them would raise meat prices by causing farmers to spend millions of dollars changing their operations, while creating supply-chain chaos and risking pigs' health. Farmers have said the stalls keep sows, which can be aggressive, from fighting and injuring each other.</p><p>On Monday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear agriculture industry groups' challenge to a 2018 California voter initiative that set minimum animal welfare standards for pork sold within the state. California has since phased in provisions that now require that breeding sows have at least 24 square feet of floor space.</p><p>Agriculture groups, including the National Pork Producers Council and American Farm Bureau Federation, argue the law is an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, increasing costs for the out-of-state farms that produce nearly all the pork sold in California. The state says its animal-welfare standards don't discriminate against out-of-state businesses because California farmers are held to the same standards.</p><p>Lower courts have upheld the California law. The Supreme Court will hear the case during its next term, which begins in October.</p><p>Carl Icahn Targets Kroger Over Pork, CEO Pay</p>",
