  "text": "<p>Senior Democratic senators have laid out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38770267-8fed-49a9-a85a-1b9cc2e45d60\">detailed plans for a minimum tax</a> on corporate profits for 200 of America's biggest companies, as lawmakers from Joe Biden's party scramble to salvage a deal on his ambitious Build Back Better agenda.</p> <p>The new proposal from progressive Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Angus King of Maine and Ron Wyden from Oregon, who chairs the Senate finance committee, is intended to close tax loopholes and raise revenue for the Treasury.</p> <p>The lawmakers said the measure, which is expected to apply to 200 corporations, would require companies that report more than $1bn in profits to shareholders pay at least 15 per cent of those back in taxes. The measure is expected raise between $300bn and $400bn over a 10-year period, they said.</p> <p>The tax is designed to offset the cost of Biden's legislative plans to pour federal funds into early childhood education, public healthcare and clean energy.</p> <p>Kyrsten Sinema, the Democratic senator from Arizona who opposed earlier proposals to increase the corporation tax rate, endorsed the proposal. But Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the other Democratic holdout in the senate, did not comment it.</p> <p>Democratic lawmakers are rushing to clinch a deal on Biden's legislative agenda before the president flies to Europe for the G20 and COP26 meetings on Thursday.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.
