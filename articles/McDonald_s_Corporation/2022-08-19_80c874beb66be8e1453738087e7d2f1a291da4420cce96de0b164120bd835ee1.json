  "title": "FedEx Shipping Contractor Turmoil Intensifies as Peak Season Nears; Business owners whose companies deliver packages for FedEx Ground are preparing to voice their concerns at a Las Vegas expo",
  "text": "<p>\"FedEx Ground is out of touch with the economic health of its independent contractors,\" said Spencer Patton, a FedEx contractor and expo organizer based in the Nashville, Tenn., area, adding that contractors banding together could help improve their chances of securing concessions from the company. </p><p>FedEx says it is looking to operate its network more efficiently and would like its contractors to do the same. PHOTO: Gabby Jones for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Regarding associations formed for advocacy, FedEx said every business, including service providers, must determine whether membership is in their organizations' best interests. The company added that it won't negotiate with a committee and that agreements with service providers, or contractors, will continue to be negotiated individually. FedEx said it wouldn't be attending the expo.</p><p>For FedEx, dealing with unrest from a portion of its more than 6,000 contractors adds to management challenges for Chief Executive Raj Subramaniam, who took over the role from founder Fred Smith on June 1. FedEx is facing pressure from investors to improve profit margins and make the Ground segment—a major revenue contributor—more efficient.</p><p>The FedEx Ground contractors, many of whom are small businesses, buy their own trucks, hire drivers and sign contracts with FedEx that typically run for 12 to 18 months, with agreements detailing requirements for service levels along designated areas, safety and payment.</p><p>FedEx said it is constantly looking to operate its network more efficiently and encourages its contractors to do the same. It said that some of its facilities offer reduced diesel prices and that it structured payments to contractors indexed to weekly price changes. The company also said it accepted a higher percentage of requests to renegotiate contracts in July than ever before.</p><p>Mr. Patton, who runs a business delivering packages along 225 routes in the Midwest, has waged a public campaign against FedEx and posted videos on YouTube calling for contractors to join a trade association he created. The former hedge-fund owner also called for the company to consider its contractors as franchisees—similar to relationships that McDonald's Corp. has with operators of most of its restaurants—instead of independent contractors. Franchisers typically have to make more financial disclosures upfront to prospective franchisees.</p><p>\"Could FedEx do more to help us? Yes. But we can also be more efficient,\" said Tony Lin, a contractor based in Newburgh, N.Y. Mr Lin., who operates routes in New York and Connecticut, said his profit margins are thinner this year and that having a bigger business helped him buffer against some economic challenges.</p><p>FedEx said rapid growth in e-commerce propelled the average annual revenue of its service providers, more than doubling over the past four years to $2.3 million. Many contractors worked to buy more trucks, hire staff and pick up routes to handle the boom in business.</p><p>Parcel volumes from e-commerce shippers have waned in recent months. Since January, a number of contractors have sent letters to company officials, citing problems with FedEx's shipping forecasts and higher costs of fuel, wages and vehicle maintenance. Contractors have said they should receive a larger chunk of the fuel surcharge that FedEx charges its customers. Some have abandoned their routes after protracted losses, according to contractors interviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Executives and engineers from FedEx Ground in recent weeks have been talking with contractors at terminals across the country where delivery trucks are loaded. FedEx staff used PowerPoint presentations to illustrate to contractors that they could reduce costs by scheduling routes better and making sure drivers are out making deliveries for at least eight or so hours a day.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How do you think the tension between FedEx and its contractors can be resolved? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"Now with market conditions changing, FedEx Ground and service providers must all adapt and adjust again,\" said FedEx spokeswoman Jenny Robertson.</p><p>Some contractors interviewed by the Journal said the presentations didn't address their complaints.</p><p>The relationship between FedEx and its contractors has shifted from being collaborative to combative, said Satish Jindel, president of the research firm SJ Consulting Group. He said that FedEx needs to listen to feedback from drivers and contractors, but that contractors need to improve the way they explain their operations and expenses to the company.</p><p>If the conflict persists, \"the winner will be the competition,\" Mr. Jindel said.</p><p>In the year ended in May, the FedEx Ground segment accounted for about 36% of total revenue. The segment's operating profit declined 17%, underperforming the company's two other major units, Express and Freight.</p><p>The company said costs for insurance rose as more drivers got into accidents, and it cited a boost in transportation and wage expenses, which included paying more for contingency drivers when contractors walked away from their routes.</p><p>FedEx said last month it would suspend Sunday residential delivery in some rural areas to help improve efficiency and reduce costs, a move that some contractors had previously called for.</p><p>Later this month, contractors said they expect to receive a schedule issued by FedEx that includes how each of their businesses would be compensated during peak delivery season, which starts around November and runs through early January.</p><p>\"We have confidence in our contingency planning and ability to deliver for our customers during this time as we weather economic changes,\" said FedEx's Ms. Robertson.</p><p>Write to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.com</p><p>FedEx Shipping Contractor Turmoil Intensifies as Peak Season Nears</p>",
