  "title": "California Governor Signs Fast Food Bill, Opening Way to Higher Wages; Gov. Gavin Newsom signs bill into law on Labor Day, creating a state council to set minimum fast food wages",
  "text": "<p>In a statement, Mr. Newsom said the law will give fast food workers a \"stronger voice and seat at the table to set fair wages and critical health and safety standards across the industry.\"</p><p>\"I'm proud, on Labor Day, to sign that bill and enshrine it in law,\" Mr. Newsom said in a video statement released Monday.</p><p>Restaurant groups and franchisees lobbied aggressively against the bill and in recent days had urged Mr. Newsom to veto it, saying it would cause widespread price increases without improving existing worker protections.</p><p>In a statement, the International Franchise Association, which lobbies on behalf of restaurant chains such as McDonald's Corp. and Yum Brands Inc., accused Mr. Newsom of siding with special interests by signing a bill \"designed to hurt the franchise business model in California.\"</p><p>\"This bill is a fork in the eye to franchise owners and customers at a time when it hurts most,\" the statement said.</p><p>Many restaurant operators said they wouldn't be able to afford to hike wages so suddenly. California's current minimum wage is $15 an hour, and is set to increase by 50 cents on Jan. 1.</p><p>\"You can't charge enough for food to offset what will happen from a labor perspective,\" said Greg Flynn, president of Flynn Restaurant Group, which operates franchise brands in 44 states and owns 105 restaurants in California. \"California is already the most difficult state in the nation to operate as a restaurateur. This just makes it more difficult and less attractive.\"</p><p>Mr. Flynn, one of the largest restaurant franchisees in the United States and a major political donor to Mr. Newsom's past campaigns, said his California stores have some of the highest sales along with the greatest costs among his portfolio.</p><p>Passing the measure was a top lobbying priority for state and national leaders of the Service Employees International Union, who were also involved in the continuing national \"Fight for $15\" campaign to raise minimum wages across the country to $15 an hour.</p><p>Speaking to reporters shortly after the announcement, SEIU international President Mary Kay Henry called the new law one of the most significant pieces of labor legislation in a generation.</p><p>\"California fast food workers have set a new model for workers having more power across their industry,\" Ms. Henry said.</p><p>Ms. Henry said the union is currently discussing lobbying for similar legislation in other states but declined to provide further detail because she said the talks were preliminary. Ingrid Vilorio, a Jack in the Box Inc. worker in the Bay Area, told reporters that she and her colleagues considered their fight for the bill a \"fight between David and Goliath.\"</p><p>\"We want to thank Gov. Newsom because we believe that this will be echoed not just here, in California, but across the nation,\" Ms. Vilorio said in Spanish. \"We know that our fight isn't over just yet.\"</p><p>Mr. Newsom signed the bill just days after it passed the state Legislature, above objections from McDonald's and other major fast food brands that lobbied against the legislation.</p><p>The head of McDonald's U.S. business publicly criticized the bill, saying it unfairly targeted larger chains in the sector and had loopholes for certain restaurants, such as those that bake bread.</p><p>\"This is a clear example of picking 'winners' and 'losers,' which is not the appropriate role of government,\" wrote Joe Erlinger, McDonald's U.S. president, in a message last month.</p><p>Several California restaurant owners said they were weighing their options given the law's signing, including possibly adding table service to their locations to try to exempt themselves from the law. The new law applies to fast food restaurants that are part of a chain, with limited or no table service, and where customers order and pay before receiving their food.</p><p>Michaela Mendelsohn, an El Pollo Loco franchisee in Southern California, said she recently put on hold plans to add to her group of six stores because of the measure.</p><p>If wages shoot up, she added, she will consider eliminating cashier positions or installing kiosks in her California locations that allow customers to input orders.</p><p>\"We've gone too far here,\" Ms. Mendelsohn said. \"It's just really discouraging.\"</p><p>Some industry opponents said they have held preliminary discussions about mounting a referendum campaign that would aim to put the issue before California voters in 2024, and seek to invalidate the law.</p><p>An earlier version of the bill would have made fast food corporations jointly liable for labor violations along with their franchisees, which industry groups fiercely opposed, and would have allowed the council to set sector-wide policy on scheduling and workplace conditions.</p><p>Mr. Newsom and top officials in his administration played a crucial role in last-minute amendments that removed the joint liability provision, capped wage minimums, and curtailed the council's authority, according to several people familiar with negotiations.</p><p>Write to Christine Mai-Duc at christine.maiduc@wsj.com and Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com</p><p>California Governor Signs Fast Food Bill, Opening Way to Higher Wages</p>",
