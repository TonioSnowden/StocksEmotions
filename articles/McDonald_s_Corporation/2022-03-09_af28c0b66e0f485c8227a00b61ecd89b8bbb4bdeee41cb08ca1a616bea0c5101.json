  "text": "<p>   Some of America's best-known brands took steps to pull back from Russia on Tuesday, when Coca-Cola Co. said it would suspend operations in the country and McDonald's Corp. said it was temporarily closing its restaurants. </p><p>   PepsiCo Inc. said it was halting sales of its big soda brands there, such as Pepsi-Cola and 7UP,  but would continue to sell potato chips and daily essentials such as milk, cheese and baby formula. The snacks-and-drinks giant is exploring options for its business in Russia, including writing off the value of the unit, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Large Western companies are under increasing pressure to pull out of the country in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Many companies -- such as American Express Co., Shell PLC and Boeing Co. -- already have announced plans to suspend or scale back their operations. Those moves came after Western governments imposed sanctions on the country in retaliation for the invasion, and financial firms took steps that could close off Russia from global markets. </p><p>   McDonald's said it was temporarily closing its roughly 850 restaurants in the country and would continue paying the 62,000 people it employs in Russia. The company said it couldn't yet determine when it might reopen the restaurants in Russia and would consider whether any additional steps might be required </p><p>   Coke's business in Russia and Ukraine contributed about 1% to 2% of its operating revenues and income in 2021. The company had an ownership interest of about 21% in Coca-Cola HBC AG, Coke's bottling and distribution partner in the region, as of Dec. 31. </p><p>   Coca-Cola HBC and PepsiCo both import soft-drink concentrates to Russia from Ireland and bottle drinks in local plants. Coca-Cola HBC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   Unilever PLC also said it was suspending imports and exports of its products into and out of Russia. Unilever, which doesn't break out sales in the region, said it would continue to supply the essential food and hygiene products it makes in Russia. </p><p>   PepsiCo is reluctant to shut  its Russian unit, which includes a large dairy business it bought for about $5 billion a decade ago. In an email to staff on Tuesday, PepsiCo Chief Executive Ramon Laguarta wrote that the company has a responsibility to continue to operate there because tens of thousands of Russians depend on the company for their livelihoods and for daily essentials like milk and baby food. </p><p>   Revenue from PepsiCo's Russian unit was $3.4 billion in 2021 -- a decline of 30% from its peak of $4.9 billion in 2013 -- making it the third-largest market for the company after the U.S. and Mexico. The impact of writing off the Russian unit would be minimal because it contributes little to PepsiCo's earnings, some of the people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   PepsiCo has 20,000 employees in Russia. The bulk of its Russian business is Wimm-Bill-Dann, a dairy-and-juice company PepsiCo bought in 2011 for about $5 billion. </p><p>   Officials at PepsiCo's highest levels have discussed the geopolitical crisis in the region nearly every day since Russia invaded Ukraine in February, some of the people familiar with the matter said. For weeks they have evaluated different scenarios of how the business may be affected by supply-chain and other financial challenges stemming from the conflict and what steps PepsiCo may need to take, one of the people said. </p><p>   PepsiCo could write down the value of its Russian business to zero, modeling the process it used for its Venezuelan operations in 2015, some of the people said. The Venezuelan unit is still operating -- and PepsiCo still owns it -- but it doesn't contribute to the soda-and-snack giant's earnings. </p><p>   PepsiCo could take this opportunity to write off a business that hasn't generated as much revenue as the company had hoped, some of the people said. At the same time, PepsiCo takes a long view on emerging markets, and doesn't want to lose the goodwill of shoppers there, current and former executives said. </p><p>   Pepsi was among the first American brands to take hold in the Soviet Union. In 1959, the company organized a booth at the American National Exhibition in Moscow. With the help of Vice President Richard Nixon, PepsiCo executive Don Kendall offered a glass to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, who agreed to several refills and declared it \"refreshing.\"\" </p><p>   PepsiCo opened its first plant in the Soviet Union in 1974 after agreeing to a barter arrangement in which the beverage giant took its profit in Stolichnaya vodka. </p><p></p>",
