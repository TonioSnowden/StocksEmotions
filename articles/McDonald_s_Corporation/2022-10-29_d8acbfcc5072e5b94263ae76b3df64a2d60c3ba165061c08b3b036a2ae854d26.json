  "title": "What recession? Caterpillar keeps repeating that demand is 'healthy,' 'strong' and 'robust'; Stock heads toward record price gain after quarterly profit and revenue rise above expectations, dispelling fears of a slowdown",
  "text": "<p>The stock, which was seeing its biggest-ever price gain of $17.49, based on FactSet data going back to 1972, added about 115 points to the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, which was up 344 points.</p><p>When asked by William Blair analyst Larry De Maria on the post-earnings conference call whether the company is concerned about a potential recession or is doing anything to prepare for one, Chief Executive Jim Umpleby appeared to shrug off recession fears.</p><p>He acknowledged that the company is closely monitoring the macroeconomic environment but said that since laying out a \"competitive and flexible\" cost structure back in 2017, it has demonstrated that it can take action when needed.</p><p>\"Having said that, as we sit here today, we continue to see healthy demand across most of our end markets,\" Umpleby said, according to a FactSet transcript.</p><p>He reiterated later in his answer that the company continued to see \"healthy demand.\"</p><p>In the call's prepared remarks and the question-and-answer period, executives used the word \"healthy\" to describe demand at least seven times, \"strong\" or \"stronger\" no fewer than four times and \"robust\" once.</p><p>Umpleby's assertions come as many signs suggest the economy is slowing and risks of a recession are growing. The chief executive of fellow Dow component McDonald's Corp. MCD, Chris Kempczinski, said Thursday in the fast-food giant's post-earnings conference call that he expects a \"mild to moderate recession\" in the U.S.</p><p>Caterpillar's Umpleby did say that there has been \"some softening\" in demand for products that support residential construction, but that, he said, comes from a situation in which demand \"has been very strong.\"</p><p>He noted that residential construction only accounts for about 25% of sales in Caterpillar's Construction Industries (CI) business segment, while the rest is nonresidential construction, which he said remains \"more resilient.\" Overall, CI revenue accounted for 41.9% of total revenue.</p><p>\"But again, demand for our products in CI at a macro level still remains quite robust,\" Umpleby repeated.</p><p>It's not too unusual for Caterpillar to stress a theme in a post-earnings call by repeating certain words and phrases.</p><p>In the call following the company's second-quarter earnings report, which led to a 5.8% drop in the stock that day, the company said that demand remained \"healthy\" and \"strong\" but also used the words \"challenges,\" \"constraints,\" \"disruptions\" or \"pressures\" a total of 19 times to describe the supply-chain situation.</p><p>Caterpillar's stock has soared 15.8% over the past three months, while the Dow is little changed.</p><p>The earnings numbers</p><p>Before Wednesday's open, Caterpillar reported third-quarter net income that rose to $2.04 billion, or $3.87 a share, from $1.43 billion, or $2.60 a share, in the same period a year ago.</p><p>Excluding nonrecurring items, such as restructuring costs, adjusted earnings per share increased to $3.95 from $2.66, well above the FactSet consensus of $3.16.</p><p>Revenue grew 20.9% to $14.99 billion, beating the FactSet consensus of $14.36 billion.</p><p>Among Caterpillar's business segments, Construction Industries revenue rose 19.4% to $6.28 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $5.99 billion; Energy and Transportation revenue increased 21.8% to $6.19 billion, beating expectations of $5.55 billion; and Resource Industries revenue was up 30.5% to $3.09 billion, outpacing expectations of $2.96 billion.</p><p>Operating profit margin improved to 16.2% from 13.4% and total costs increased less than sales, rising 17.1% to $12.57 billion. For the fourth quarter, the company expects operating profit margin to be \"significantly\" higher than a year ago and \"slightly\" higher than in the third quarter.</p><p>Inventories continued to increase and were valued at $16.86 billion as of Sept. 30, up from $15.88 billion at the end of the second quarter and $15.04 billion at the end of the first quarter.</p><p>What recession? Caterpillar keeps repeating that demand is 'healthy,' 'strong' and 'robust'</p>",
