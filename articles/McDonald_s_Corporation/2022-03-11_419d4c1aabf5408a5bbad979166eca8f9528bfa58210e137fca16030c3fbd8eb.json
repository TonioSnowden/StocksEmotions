  "title": "Pressure Mounts for Western Companies Leaving Russia; Putin endorses plan to nationalize assets of foreign companies",
  "text": "<p>Separately, the Russian prosecutor general's office on Friday said it would ensure companies that have said they are pausing or exiting operations comply with the country's labor laws. More than 300 foreign companies have said they are leaving or temporarily suspending work in Russia, according to the Yale School of Management.</p><p>Read live updates on Russia's invasion of Ukraine</p><p>The planned departures and suspensions have left thousands of workers in limbo. Many companies, particularly retailers and manufacturers, have said their decision to stop operations was temporary. Others said they were related to the disruptionsanctions have had on supply chains. Still, others have committed to leaving for good.</p><p>Some Western companies have already accounted for the possible long-term loss of assets, detailing or warning of write-downs related to their businesses there. BP PLC, among the first big companies to say it would leave Russia, is relinquishing its nearly 20% stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft. The stake was valued at around $14 billion at year-end, and BP said it doesn't expect to recoup any of that.</p><p>\"We've effectively walked away from our business in Russia,\" said BP nonexecutive director John Sawers at a recent Wall Street Journal CEO Council event. Mr. Sawers said the value of BP's Rosneft stake is currently close to zero.</p><p>In most cases, though, companies have kept the door open to an eventual return. Many companies would struggle to keep businesses going inside Russia even if they didn't decide to pause or pull out: Sanctions imposed by the West have hit foreign companies' ability to execute basic tasks, such as bringing in parts, paying employees and getting paid for services done inside the country.</p><p>McDonald's Corp. said that its move to close its 847 Russian restaurantsis temporary, but that it will cost the burger giant roughly $50 million a month from supply chain and other costs. It said it will continue to pay the 62,000 people the company employs there.</p><p>Washington warned against a nationalization effort. \"Any lawless decision by Russia to seize the assets of these companies will ultimately result in even more economic pain for Russia\" and may invite legal action, White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted Thursday.</p><p>Nationalization or other such attempts at seizing or expropriating assets would hit companies very differently. For some, it could entail a relatively light financial burden—for instance, losing leases on stores or offices. Harder to assess is the risk of losing intellectual property in any nationalization. New owners installed by the Kremlin may be able to figure out how to make certain products made by foreign companies inside Russia, or continue to use Western brand names inside the country.</p><p>For other companies with operations that include expensive manufacturing equipment or logistics assets, such as warehouses and fleets of trucks, the hit could be heavy.</p><p>Mercedes-Benz Group AG said the potential risk from an expropriation of assets from its businesses in Russia could be as much as €2 billion, equivalent to $2.2 billion. The German luxury car maker made the comment in its annual report, which was published Friday.</p><p>Mercedes suspended exports of cars and vans to Russia on March 2 until further notice. It said Friday that in addition to any direct impact on its subsidiaries in Russia, Mercedes also has guaranteed about €1 billion in bank liabilities owed by its Russian subsidiaries. It ticked off financial exposure that included potential impairments of trade receivables, property, plants, equipment and inventories and the higher risks of insolvency at subsidiaries. \"These risks would be exacerbated by the potential expropriation of assets of Russian subsidiaries,\" Mercedes said in the report.</p><p>Some companies appeared to be moving pre-emptively to signal they are selling out. British American Tobacco PLC said Friday it had concluded that its ownership of its business in Russia is no longer sustainable and it would start a process to rapidly transfer it. It said it would continue to pay its 2,500 employees and \"do our utmost to safeguard their future employment.\"</p><p>One of the most vulnerable countries to any Russian nationalization is Germany, the biggest foreign investor in the country, according to Ernst &amp; Young, followed by China and the U.S.</p><p>Over the past two decades, German companies undertook 418 projects in Russia, more than any other European country, EY said. EY said manufacturing remained the most attractive sector for foreign investment in Russia, but in 2020 half the investment from Germany and the U.S. was in Russia's agricultural sector.</p><p>The auto industry has provided among the biggest western investments in Russia over the past 20 years. In the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraineauto makers around the world have stopped production and frozen business with Russia.</p><p>In 2021, German car maker Volkswagen AG produced about 118,000 cars at its plant in Kaluga, Russia. It also contracts assembly of VW brand and Skoda vehicles to a Russia company, GAZ Group, in Nizhny Novgorod, that produced 52,300 vehicles last year, VW said. VW also produced about 96,100 engines in Kaluga last year. The company said: \"It is not possible to predict at present what the long-term impact on our business in Russia will be.\"</p><p>Another big European investor in Russia is French car maker Renault SA. The company has taken control of Russia's AvtoVAZ, which makes Lada cars, and derives about 8% of its earnings before interest and taxes from Russia, according to research by Citi. Renault operates three plants in Russia, which could be forfeited if Moscow expropriates foreign-owned assets. A spokesman for Renault said it didn't have any comment.</p><p>Mr. Putin's move brought a rare public rebuke from one of Russia's most powerful businessmen, Vladimir Potanin.</p><p>Mr. Potanin, who is the chief executive and biggest shareholder in mining giant MMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC, said that nationalizing businesses would earn the distrust of global investors for decades to come.</p><p>\"This would take us back a hundred years to 1917,\" he said, referring to the Bolshevik Revolution, which led to nationalization of private business. Mr. Potanin said the decision by companies to leave Russia was \"somewhat emotional\" and may have come from the pressure of public opinion.</p><p>\"Therefore, it is likely that they will come back,\" said Mr. Potanin. \"And personally, I would keep that option open for them.\"</p><p>Alistair MacDonald contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Evan Gershkovich at evan.gershkovich@wsj.com, William Boston at william.boston@wsj.com and Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com</p><p>Pressure Mounts for Western Companies Leaving Russia</p>",
