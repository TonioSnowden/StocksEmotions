  "title": "World News: Politics Splits Two Ukrainian Brothers in War",
  "text": "<p>Father Iosif called and asked how he knew it was the Russians, not the Ukrainians, who were responsible. \"This is just what war is like,\" he said.</p><p>Vasyl hung up and began crying. He didn't speak with his brother for two months.</p><p>The friction between the brothers -- who were born in western Ukraine and grew up speaking Ukrainian -- is a microcosm of rifts affecting many Ukrainian and Russian families. For 59-year-old Iosif, who moved to Russia in 1989, the conflict is a just war to take back historically Russian lands. For the younger Vasyl, who stayed in Ukraine, it is a barbaric crime propped up by the Kremlin's lies.</p><p>Russia and Ukraine have historical and cultural ties stretching back centuries, and some 20 million Ukrainians have relatives in Russia. Many of those Ukrainians live in cities that have been targeted by Russian missiles and are the scene of atrocities by Russian soldiers.</p><p>But in Russia, TV propaganda backed by officials and the powerful Orthodox Churchhas convinced many that the invasion is a mission to prise Ukraine from the West's grasp and liberate its Russian-speaking population.</p><p>The two parallel realities have helped create a gulf between siblings, between parents and children, and between husbands and wives.</p><p>The Ivanchuk brothers both served in the Soviet army in the waning years of the Soviet Union, both lived in Kharkiv in northeast Ukraine as students, and both became priests at a time of spiritual revival as the atheist communist empire crumbled.</p><p>But while Vasyl came away from military service believing that dysfunction in Moscow's army reflected a society coming apart at the seams, Iosif recalls a Russian-speaking camaraderie later shattered by the Soviet collapse that tore Ukraine from Russia and allowed the West to take advantage. He calls himself Russian and praises the new churches built under President Vladimir Putin's rule as evidence that Russia holds the moral high ground.</p><p>\"The chaos that is happening in Ukraine is God's retribution,\" he says. \"They are trying to purge part of their population, and constantly place our country in the crosshairs.\" He says deaths of Ukrainian civilians are a regrettable side effect of Russian attacks on military objects, and believesVasyl isn't getting the full picture.</p><p>Many of his own views -- about a fascist government in Kyiv waging \"genocide\" against inhabitants of eastern Ukraine -- reflect the narrative promoted on Russian state TV, which he consumes alongside Ukrainian news sources.</p><p>Vasyl says he finds it hard to understand why Iosif denies Russian aggression when he has seen the footage of Kharkiv's destruction that Vasyl sends him over WhatsApp. Moreover, two of Iosif's sons lost jobs as managers at McDonald's after the chain withdrew from Russia, though they were later reinstated when it reopened under a different name.</p><p>\"I tell him: You have a smartphone, you have Telegram, you have alternative sources of information,\" Vasyl said. He and his siblings describe Iosif as a kind father and community member, who has welcomed refugees from eastern Ukraine into his church.</p><p>On May 29, Vasyl's birthday, Iosif called for the first time since the attack onVasyl's church. He listened silently for around 20 minutes, and when Vasyl asked about his children, Iosif sighed and said they were out of work. \"After three months of war he began to understand just a little about what is really happening,\" Vasyl said.</p><p>Later, when Russia conducted sham referendums in occupied parts of Ukraine last month and declared almost unanimous support there for annexation by Russia, Iosif said Russia had to respect the wishes of local residents.</p><p>Iosif said that if he could, he would go to see his brother in Kharkiv, where his beloved Orthodox saints are buried. But he wishes he could return to the Ukraine he lived in during Soviet times.</p><p>\"I understand my brother, and I hope I have his understanding,\" he said. \"I just want our relations to remain as they once were.\"</p><p>Vasylsaid he would struggle to forgive Russians for the pain they have caused. \"It's my duty to forgive, as a priest and a Christian. But I don't know,\" he said. \"I can't force my heart to do it. There's such a wound here, such enormous pain.\"</p>",
