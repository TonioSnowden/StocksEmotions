  "title": "Canada Strips Military of Powers to Investigate Sexual Misconduct; Defense minister says all investigations, prosecutions of sexual offenses in military to be handled by civilian law enforcement",
  "text": "<p>Academics who study sexual misconduct in the military had argued Canada lagged behind the U.S. and other jurisdictions in addressing sexual-misconduct complaints in the military, in part because legislative armed-services oversight is among the weakest relative to other major Western democracies.</p><p>Anita Anand, named Canada's defense minister last week, said the move would help the armed forces \"live up to its stated values and the expectations of Canadians,\" and was recommended by a former Supreme Court of Canada justice the government appointed this year to investigate sexual misconduct in the military. Ms. Anand is a lawyer and was a law professor before entering politics in 2019.</p><p>The former top-court justice, Louise Arbour, said in an Oct. 20 letter to defense officials that there is \"significant skepticism on the part of stakeholders and most importantly survivors, with respect to the independence and competence\" of the military to deal with sexual-misconduct complaints. \"This perception is pervasive in the armed forces and, I believe, a large segment of the population.\"</p><p>Megan MacKenzie, an expert on military culture and a professor at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, said what Canada intends to do is relatively unique in the Western world. However, she added some militaries are starting to give victims of sexual misconduct the chance to have their cases heard by civilian authorities \"precisely because of issues of trust, transparency and conflict of interest.\"</p><p>This year, Canadian military police investigated allegations of sexual misconduct against the country's former top soldier and his successor. Other senior military leaders also faced sexual-misconduct allegations that either prompted the officers to go on leave or postpone a planned promotion. The series of allegations targeting top brass has earned rebukes from Mr. Trudeau and other senior Liberal administration officials.</p><p>Related</p><p>* Canada Confronts Sexual Misconduct in Its Military (May 23, 2021)</p><p>* Military Justice Overhaul Reaches Key Level of Support in Senate (May 13, 2021)</p><p>In the case of Adm. Art McDonald, who took over as chief of defense staff in January, military police said in August its investigation didn't unearth evidence to support the filing of charges. Adm. McDonald remains on administrative leave and Mr. Trudeau said last month officials are reviewing his future. \"I've been exonerated,\" Adm. McDonald told The Globe and Mail newspaper in an interview published Oct. 12, adding he wanted to return as the country's top soldier. He didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Adm. McDonald's predecessor, Gen. Jonathan Vance, faces an obstruction-of-justice charge. Canadian prosecutors allege the former top soldier attempted to impede the military police's investigation of sexual-misconduct allegations by persuading a witness \"to make false statements about their past relationship,\" according to a court filing. A lawyer for Gen. Vance declined to comment.</p><p>In the U.S. Congress, a coalition of Democratic and Republican lawmakers are pushing for their own overhaul of the military justice system. A bill in the House of Representatives would create a special office within each serviceof the armed forces, reporting directly to the appropriate secretary, that would have jurisdiction over sexual assault and sexual harassment, among other things. That doesn't go as far as language in a Senate version of a bill that would enact a sweeping overhaul of the military justice system, stripping commanders of their authority to decide whether to prosecute all felony-level crimes, from sexual assault and harassment to murder and manslaughter.</p><p>The language in the Senate bill is based on legislation proposed by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) and Joni Ernst (R., Iowa), and would empower independent military prosecutors rather than commanders to decide whether cases should go to trial.</p><p>Write to Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com</p><p>Canada Strips Military of Powers to Investigate Sexual Misconduct</p>",
