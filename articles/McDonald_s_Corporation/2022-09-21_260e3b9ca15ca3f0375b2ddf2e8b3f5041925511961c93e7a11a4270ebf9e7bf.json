  "text": "<p>Chicago</p><p>---</p><p>My wife and I left Chicago in 2020 due to the crime and chaos, even though we lived in the supposedly safe neighborhood of Bucktown. Our decision was validated when, scant weeks later, a neighbor was shot in an attempted carjacking in the alley not 10 yards from our former home. He survived and, with his family, joined the Chicago exodus.</p><p>We hated to leave -- Chicago has so much to offer. But a vibrant cultural scene and dazzling architecture are hard to appreciate when you're ducking at every loud noise and constantly checking your rearview mirror. Many of our formerly active Chicago friends are simply laying low. McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski summed it up: \"McDonald's commitment to Chicago . . . it's not open ended and unconditional.\"</p><p>John Knoerle</p><p>Shorewood, Wis.</p>",
