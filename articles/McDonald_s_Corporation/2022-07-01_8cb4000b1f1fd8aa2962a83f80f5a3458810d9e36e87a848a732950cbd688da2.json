  "text": "<p>The move is one of the most drastic responses by the Kremlin so far to the flight of Western companies from Russia in the wake of the country's invasion of Ukraine in late February. Many Western firms have since said they would seek to leave Russia, and have started doing so in widely different ways. Shell, for instance, had already said it would exit its 27.5% stake in Sakhalin-2 as part of its plans to leave Russia, without specifying how.</p><p>Japan's Mitsubishi and Mitsui &amp; Co. own 10% and 12.5%, respectively, while Russian energy giant Gazprom PJSC owns the remaining roughly 50%.</p><p>The Kremlin has threatened to nationalize the assets of companies that leave Russia, but legislation proposed months ago hasn't progressed into law. Other Western companies that have sought to exit have found Russian buyers for their businesses.</p><p>On Friday, Exxon Mobil Corp. said it had made substantial progress winding down operations at a separate Sakhalin Island oil-and-gas project that wasn't subject to the Kremlin's decree. The company vowed in March to exit that earlier project, Sakhalin-1, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, leading to it taking a $3.4 billion accounting charge in the first quarter.</p><p>The Texas-based oil company said winding down operations has been enormously complex but that it had cut the Sakhalin-1 development's output by about 95% to about 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, supplying only enough natural gas required to meet the basic electricity and heating needs of its regional Russian customers.</p><p>McDonald's Corp. sold its chain of restaurants to a local franchisee, which has rebranded and reopened some of the stores. The fast-food giant didn't disclose a price. Canadian miner Kinross Gold Corp. said in April it had agreed to sell a giant Arctic Russian mine to a unit of Fortiana Holdings Ltd., a Russia-backed investment firm.</p><p>Political pressure on big energy companies, in particular, to cease or pull out of Russian operations mounted quickly after President Vladimir Putin's invasion. But amid a series of announcements about planned exits or divestments, it hasn't been clear how companies would go about unloading the holdings and partnerships. Other foreign buyers of Russian assets were seen as scarce, and many wealthy Russian individuals and entities were themselves cut off by sanctions and banking controls.</p><p>Some company executives and lawyers in recent months discussed options for ringfencing their assets, while winding them down and trying to preserve as much value as possible, and taking other legal steps in an effort to keep the holdings from falling back into Russian hands. Lawyers say that any steps by Russia to limit Western companies' options for selling the assets could give the companies grounds to argue indirect expropriation and seek remedies in international courts. Such processes would likely take years to resolve, lawyers say.</p><p>The new decree related to Sakhalin, signed late Thursday by Mr. Putin, gives foreign investors one month to ask to be allowed to keep their stake in the new entity. Russia would then make a decision. Stakes left on the table would be sold by the government.</p><p>A Shell spokesperson said the company is aware of the decree and is assessing its implications. \"As a shareholder, Shell has always acted in the best interests of Sakhalin-2 and in accordance with all applicable legal requirements,\" the spokesperson said. Representatives for Mitsui and Mitsubishi said the companies were also looking at the decree and holding talks with the Japanese government on what steps to take.</p><p>In May, Mitsui's boss said his company would push ahead with a separate Siberian natural-gas project, part of Tokyo's decision to continue relying on Russian energy.</p><p>The move drew a measured response from Tokyo. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he didn't think the decree would immediately affect current LNG shipments from Sakhalin island, which account for almost a 10th of the country's gas supply.</p><p>\"We need to think about how we respond by ensuring good communication with the business operators,\" he said.</p><p>Many foreign investors including U.S. and U.K. oil companies have largely written off their stakes in Russian assets.</p><p>In May, Shell took a $3.9 billion charge related to its Russia exit. Shell wrote down $1.6 billion tied to Sakhalin-2 assets alone, reflecting its loss of managerial influence and profit tied to the massive project. Another $1.1 billion piece of the Russia-related charges was tied to Shell's involvement in financing Nord Stream 2, a gas pipeline.</p><p>Shell has also said it would sell its Russian retail-station and lubricants business to oil giant Lukoil PJSC. Shell didn't disclose a deal value. The sale of the business, called Shell Neft LLC, included 411 retail stations in Russia and a lubricants-blending plant near Moscow. Shell previously had valued the business at about $600 million.</p><p>BP PLC took a $25.5 billion charge in its first-quarter results, largely driven by a write-down of its 20% stake in Rosneft Oil Co.</p><p>Jaime Llinares Taboada and Chieko Tsuneoka contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Mauro Orru at mauro.orru@wsj.com and Jenny Strasburg at jenny.strasburg@wsj.com</p><p>Russia Takes Control of International LNG Project</p>",
