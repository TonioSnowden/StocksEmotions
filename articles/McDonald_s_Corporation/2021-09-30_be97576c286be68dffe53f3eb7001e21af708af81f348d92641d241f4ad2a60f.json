  "title": "U.K. Police Officer Who Murdered Sarah Everard Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; Wayne Couzens receives a rare whole-life sentence for a crime that triggered ongoing debate about women's safety",
  "text": "<p>He later raped her and strangled her to death with his police-issue belt before burning her body, the court heard. Ms. Everard's remains were found several days later in a wooded area Mr. Couzens owned 60 miles southeast of the capital in Kent. He confessed to the crimes back in July.</p><p>The judge, Lord Justice Adrian Fulford, described Mr. Couzens' actions as \"grotesque,\" the British Broadcasting Corp. reported. The severity of the crime and the way it had undermined public confidence in the police merited the unusual whole-life sentence, Mr. Fulford said. In the U.K., these sentences are usually reserved for terrorism-related offenses or multiple murders, or the killing of police or prison officers or children.</p><p>In the wake of Ms. Everard's abduction, many women took to social media to recall instances in which they had been attacked or had near misses. Others shared tips on self-protection, from using a smartphone as an alarm to clenching keys between knuckles so as to inflict more damage if they had to fight.</p><p>Vigils were held in some cities, with participants demanding that women be able to go about their daily business without threat or intimidation. Police broke up the largest, on Clapham Common, near where Ms. Everard was abducted, and detained and handcuffed a number of women. London Mayor Sadiq Khan criticized the violent dispersal of the vigil, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson expressed concern, but London Police Commissioner Cressida Dick defended the policing.</p><p>The U.K. government has laid out plans to improve public safety, including funding better street lighting and more security cameras, in addition to a program to send undercover police to nightclubs and other potentially high-risk sites.</p><p>Women's safety continues to be a hot-button issue, and was given fresh momentum this month after the killing of schoolteacher Sabina Nessa. Ms. Nessa, 28, was attacked in southeast London on Sept. 17, with a passerby discovering her body in a nearby park. Garage worker Koci Selamaj has been charged with her murder. He has indicated that he will deny involvement, ahead of a plea hearing.</p><p>Antagonism toward police re-escalated in recent days after evidence presented in court showed Mr. Couzens had used his police identification to detain Ms. Everard before whisking her away in an unmarked car. Prosecutor Tom Little told the court that Mr. Couzens had used his authority as a police officer with the specific intention of abducting a woman. Security camera footage showed Ms. Everard got into Mr. Couzens' car after he confronted her on the street. It was the last time she was seen alive.</p><p>Lawmakers and women's rights groups have been especially critical of the police's failure to investigate previous allegations of sexual offenses by Mr. Couzens dating back to 2015, and for quashing protests criticizing the investigation of Ms. Everard's murder, which they say reveals the Metropolitan Police doesn't take women's safety seriously. An independent agency responsible for reviewing police conduct is investigating accusations that Mr. Couzens exposed himself in a McDonald's only three days before he abducted Ms. Everard.</p><p>\"If only he'd been sentenced for the previous complaints against him,\" opposition Labour lawmaker Jess Phillips said Wednesday on Twitter.</p><p>The Metropolitan Police acknowledged some failings before the sentencing began Wednesday. \"We are sickened, angered and devastated by this man's crimes, which betray everything we stand for,\" it said in a statement.</p><p>Write to James Hookway at james.hookway@wsj.com</p><p>U.K. Police Officer Who Murdered Sarah Everard Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>",
