  "text": "<p>Kempczinski on Monday afternoon planned to address U.S. employees, some at the company's Chicago headquarters and others virtually, regarding comments that “were wrong — plain and simple,” he wrote in an email to staff Friday.</p><p>“I am learning from this,” said Kempczinski in the message, viewed by the Wall Street Journal. “I believe that starts with more listening and learning from more people whose life experiences are different from my own.”</p><p>In an exchange&#xa0;with Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot this past April, Kempczinski referenced the shooting deaths of two city children, 13-year-old Adam Toledo and 7-year-old Jaslyn Adams. Jaslyn Adams was in a McDonald's drive-through at the time of the shooting.</p><p>An&#xa0;increase in murders&#xa0;that began last year in U.S. cities, including Chicago, is carrying forward into 2021. It has been concentrated in poor neighborhoods, typically Black and Hispanic, with persistent histories of violence. Adam Toledo was shot by Chicago police in a largely Mexican neighborhood on the city's West Side. Jaslyn Adams was shot by a gunman while sitting in a car with her dad in North Lawndale, a predominantly Black neighborhood also on the West Side.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.</p><p>More McDonald's news:</p><p>Wendy's is trying to beat McDonald's at the French fry game — our critic declares a winner</p><p>McDonald's put a McRib NFT on the menu for $20 — here's how to get one</p><p>Trending at WSJ.com:</p><p>Don't be that awkward colleague: a guide to office etiquette</p><p>Rich millennials would rather manage their own money, thank you</p>",
