  "text": "<p>Mr. Pace, a well-known figure in the world of sports marketing, died Feb. 8 after a snowmobile he was riding hit a tree in the Montana resort community of Big Sky. He was 64 years old.</p><p>The $5 footlong promotion, announced in 2008, was greeted with some skepticism. \"I had a lot of colleagues with experience in the category tell me it would never work, because the price was too high,\" Mr. Pace told The Wall Street Journal in 2014. \"Obviously, they were wrong, because we have sold billions of them at this point.\" He gave some of the credit to comical TV ads with a memorable theme song.</p><p>Subway faced a crisis in 2009 when a photo surfaced of Mr. Phelps holding a marijuana pipe. The company had to decide whether to keep working with the Olympic swimmer. Mr. Pace said he couldn't make a knee-jerk decision.</p><p>\"The next couple days were crazy,\" he said, as news organizations demanded information on how Subway would react. Mr. Pace noted that public perceptions of Mr. Phelps were starting to recover a few days after the photo appeared. Subway decided to stick with him. \"Like most Americans, we accept his apology,\" Subway said at the time.</p><p>Spotting another opportunity, Mr. Pace arranged in 2014 for Pelé to meet Mariano Rivera, the star Yankees relief pitcher. The result was a widely circulated photo of the two, with Pelé in a bright yellow Subway T-shirt.</p><p>Mr. Pace tangled with his own industry while serving as chairman of the Association of National Advertisers from 2015 to 2017. The association found evidence that media companies were using rebates to reward ad agencies for buying ad time or space on behalf of their clients. Instead of giving the money to the advertising client, some agencies were keeping it, the association believed. Many agencies denied they engaged in the practice.</p><p>Mr. Pace and others at the association hired an outside firm to investigate the rebates in 2016 and found they were widespread. That was embarrassing both for agencies and for chief marketing officers at the agencies' clients who may have overlooked the potential for abuse. Against opposition from some association members, Mr. Pace insisted on releasing the findings to the public.</p><p>As a result, advertisers insisted on new wording in contracts with ad agencies to make sure any rebates were disclosed, said Bob Liodice, chief executive of the association.</p><p>Leonard Anthony Pace, known as Tony, was born Aug. 3, 1957, and grew up in Cranford and Summit, N.J. His father was a management consultant, and his mother had been a kindergarten teacher.</p><p>He played on his high-school baseball team and was sports editor of the student newspaper.</p><p>At the University of Notre Dame, he studied economics and worked as a radio broadcaster and a writer and editor of the Observer student newspaper. He had a summer job writing about sports at a newspaper in Morristown, N.J. He earned an M.B.A. degree at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.</p><p>Early in his career, he worked at the ad agencies Young &amp; Rubicam and McCann-Erickson. He joined Subway in 2006 and stayed nearly a decade. His departure in 2015 came shortly after Subway severed ties with a longtime pitchman, Jared Fogle, who was later sentenced to more than 15 years in federal prison on charges of distributing child pornography and illicit sexual conduct with a minor.</p><p>At the time, Mr. Pace said his departure had nothing to do with the Fogle situation. \"I wanted to do something new,\" he said.</p><p>Subway grew rapidly during most of his time as chief marketing officer. By mid-2015, Subway had more than 27,000 U.S. restaurants, compared with about 14,300 for McDonald's Corp. But Subway sales slumped in 2014, suggesting that the company had expanded too fast and let quality slip.</p><p>In recent years, Mr. Pace had his own consulting firm, Cerebral Graffiti. He also was chief executive of the Marketing Accountability Standards Board, where his projects included a 2021 paper advising companies on ways to value their brands in financial terms.</p><p>He met Ellen Hyde when both were working at Young &amp; Rubicam. They married in 1999. She survives him, along with two children, his mother and five siblings.</p><p>He advised marketing executives to respond quickly to new opportunities. \"More than ever you need to be in the test-and-learn mode,\" he told The Wall Street Journal, \"because you can't wait for a general consensus to emerge on what is working and what isn't, because you may be late.\"</p><p>Write to James R.
