  "text": "<p>   Trian Fund Management LP, Wendy's Co.'s largest shareholder, said it is exploring an acquisition or another potential deal for the fast-food restaurant, as it works to improve sales and deals with rising costs. </p><p>   The activist hedge fund said it advised the fast-food restaurant chain's board that it intends to explore and evaluate a potential transaction, alone or with third parties, to enhance shareholder value, according to a securities filing Tuesday. A potential transaction could include an acquisition, merger or other deal that would result in control of Wendy's. </p><p>   Wendy's shares jumped 17% to $19.08 in after-hours trading Tuesday. </p><p>   Trian owns 19.4% of the company and is the company's largest shareholder, according to the filing. </p><p>   Trian is led by billionaire founders Nelson Peltz, Peter May and Ed Garden. </p><p>   Mr. Peltz is chairman of Wendy's, and Mr. May is vice chairman. </p><p>   Wendy's said its board will carefully review any proposal by Trian. </p><p>   The company has been fighting to win more consumers by increasing the number of its locations and menu offerings, including through new chicken sandwiches. </p><p>   The chain started a new breakfast business just as the pandemic first hit and has spent millions of dollars promoting and running it. </p><p>   Wendy's shares are down 32% this year, trailing rivals McDonald's Corp. and Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International Inc. </p><p>   The company told investors  this month that its traffic slowed in the three months ended April 3 and that lower-income consumers accounted for part of the drop-off. </p><p>   Sales among households earning less than $75,000 were weaker, Wendy's executives said in an earnings call. The chain raised prices in its first quarter and intends to do so again in its current period, executives said. </p><p>   Wendy's, like other fast-food chains, is grappling with rising costs. </p><p>   The company has told investors that its commodity costs were increasing faster than expected, driven by higher beef prices. Restaurant-level profit decreased in its first quarter, primarily due to commodity increases, the chain said. </p><p>   Trian, founded in 2005, first invested in Wendy's predecessor company that year. Mr. Peltz had served as a director of Triarc Cos., Wendy's previous business entity, starting in 1993 and has been a Wendy's director since 2008. </p><p></p>",
