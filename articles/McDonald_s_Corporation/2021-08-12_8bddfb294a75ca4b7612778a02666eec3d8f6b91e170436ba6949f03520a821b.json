  "text": "<p>Private employers are considering -- and making -- similar moves to keep employees and the public safe. On Wednesday, McDonald's Corp. and the New York Stock Exchange instated vaccination mandates for many employees. During the latest surge, states and cities have largely left these decisions to businesses and others, rather than attempt the types of sweeping mandates or lockdowns put into place during earlier surges.</p><p>Hawaii Gov. David Ige last week ordered that public school employees be vaccinated or tested regularly as part of a broader order affecting all state and county employees there. Several cities, including New York City, Oakland, Calif., and San Francisco, have recently enacted similar rules.</p><p>Also Wednesday, U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said he supports mandated vaccination for school employees if the Food and Drug Administration gives full approval of the vaccines.</p><p>\"I was hoping the FDA stamp would happen already but I respect that process,\" Dr. Cardona said at a virtual meeting with the National Press Foundation.</p><p>FDA officials are debating whether to give full approval to Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine as soon as this month.</p><p>Under California's public-health order, school personnel will need to prove they are fully inoculated by Oct. 15 or agree to weekly testing for the virus.</p><p>\"We think this is the right thing to do and we think this is a sustainable way to keeping our schools open,\" Mr. Newsom said at a news conference. \"It's the right thing to do to keep our most precious resource healthy and safe, our children here in the state.\"</p><p>The Democrat declined to say whether he plans to mandate eligible students to be vaccinated to attend school in the future. \"We'll consider that if necessary, but we believe this is a meaningful first step,\" he said.</p><p>Enforcement of the new rules at public and private schools will fall to local officials, said Alex Stack, a spokesman for Mr. Newsom. \"There's some discretion on how this gets enforced on the local level, but this is the law,\" he said.</p><p>California, which has long enrolled the most K-12 students of any state, had 6.65 million children in public and private schools in the 2019-20 school year, according to state and federal data.</p><p>The state order should help reduce the spread of Covid-19 in schools, particularly when combined with California's rule that all students and staff must wear masks indoors, said Shira Shafir, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p>\"I think it's a necessary measure. . .and hopefully other states will follow California's lead,\" Dr. Shafir said. \"Since children under the age of 12 are not eligible for vaccination as of yet, ensuring that the adults in the schools are vaccinated, coupled with mask wearing and testing, is the best way for children to return to in-person instruction safely.\"</p><p>Parent Katy Meza said despite all the regulations state and local officials have now put in place, she was still uncomfortable about sending her 9-year-old son, Matthew, to his school in South Gate, south of downtown Los Angeles.</p><p>\"After everything I have heard about the vaccine and people still getting Covid, I still don't feel safe,\" said Ms. Meza, whose elderly parents live with her. She said she will still send Matthew to school, however, given his poor experience with online learning.</p><p>Families and government officials nationwide are debating requirements for vaccines and masks as schools begin to open, especially in states like Florida and Texas, where local districts have fought state edicts against mask mandates.</p><p>As of Friday, at least four states had enacted laws that banned mask mandates for schools while other states, including California and Illinois, have required them, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures and state officials. Bans blocking schools and colleges from requiring Covid-19 vaccination or proof of vaccination passed in at least eight states as of last month. In some cases, the bans extend to other public entities and private businesses.</p><p>California's new mandate comes as Covid-19 cases, caused in large part by the Delta variant, have been growing across the nation. It mirrors a similar order that took effect last week for state employees, which didn't apply to teachers, as they work for local districts and not the state. California has also ordered that all healthcare workers be vaccinated by Sept. 30, with exceptions for those who have medical or religious reasons to decline.</p><p>Across California, 63.8% of residents over 12 are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, compared with 58.8% of those nationwide, according to state and federal health data.</p><p>The California Teachers Association, the state's largest umbrella teachers union that represents about 310,000 educators, said nearly 90% of its membership is vaccinated, based on internal survey data.</p><p>The heads of the CTA and the California Federation of Teachers, which together represent nearly all public school teachers in California, said they support the new state rules.</p><p>Blanca Gallegos, a spokeswoman for SEIU Local 99, which represents nearly 50,000 bus drivers, custodians and other school support staff, said her organization supports the state mandate, but wants districts to bargain with local unions over paid time for testing, sick leave for vaccine side effects and who would shoulder testing costs.</p><p>\"We just want to make sure the implementation takes into consideration the needs of frontline workers and their families,\" Ms. Gallegos said.</p><p>---</p><p>Talal Ansari contributed to this article.</p>",
