  "text": "<p>Two of Restaurant Brands' biggest divisions, Tim Hortons and Burger King, have struggled coming out of the pandemic. Covid-19 restrictions in Canada hurt sales at coffee chain Tim Hortons. Burger King, traditionally the second-biggest burger brand behind McDonald's Corp., in 2020 slipped behind Wendy's Co.</p><p>Toronto-based Restaurant Brands recently increased investment in its chains, which include Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and Firehouse Subs.</p><p>Mr. Doyle said he is confident his work will boost the company's stock, and was putting his own money behind it. \"My investment in this is the best indication I can give you that there's a lot of value that can be created here,\" he said.</p><p>Restaurant Brands last year installed another longtime Domino's executive to head Burger King's U.S. business. The company recently said it would spend $400 million to boost Burger King's U.S. advertising and store conditions.</p><p>Mr. Doyle will earn the performance-linked shares if Restaurant Brands' stock climbs to at least $81.32 in five years, with a maximum award if the company's stock increases to more than $122, the company said. Restaurant Brands shares rose 6.7% Wednesday to $63.75.</p>",
