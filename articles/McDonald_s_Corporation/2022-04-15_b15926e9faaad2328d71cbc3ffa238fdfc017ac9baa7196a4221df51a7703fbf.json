  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis:  Companies Add Up Russian Business Losses  ----  By Jean Eaglesham and Thomas Gryta",
  "text": "<p>   Global businesses are tallying up tens of billions in losses from their Russian operations as they grapple with the impact of asset sales, shutdowns and sanctions, according to public statements and securities filings. </p><p>   The cost to shareholders of Western companies' exodus from Russia will become clearer in coming weeks, as companies make their first earnings announcements since the invasion of Ukraine. </p><p>   More than 600 Western companies have said they would exit or cut back operations in Russia, say researchers at Yale University. </p><p>   Losses stemming from the pullout include the expected write-down, or complete write-off, of assets ranging from oil wells to car factories and consumer loans, according to statements by the companies. </p><p>   The effects will be felt well beyond the announcements that have come mostly from energy companies. A fifth of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 listed Russia subsidiaries for 2021, says data provider Calcbench. </p><p>   The biggest hit so far is expected to come from British oil giant BP PLC, which faces a potential loss of as much as $25 billion from exiting its nearly 20% stake in Kremlin-controlled oil producer Rosneft. </p><p>   At the other end of the scale, Swedish telecom company Ericsson AB this week made a provision of 900 million Swedish kronor, equivalent to around $95 million, for asset-impairment and other costs stemming from the indefinite suspension of its Russian operations. An Ericsson spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the disclosure. </p><p>   Russia-related impairments are likely to have the biggest impact on earnings of European companies, said Carla Nunes, a managing director at risk-consulting firm Kroll LLC. \"In the U.S., inflation and global supply-chain disruption are together likely to have a bigger impact,\" she said. </p><p>   The question of whether a company has to take a Russia-related earnings hit depends partly on whether it is disposing of assets, mothballing them, or just stopping sales in Russia, according to John McInnis, an accounting professor at the University of Texas at Austin. </p><p>   Under international and U.S. accounting rules, decisions about whether to impair an asset are based on its expected value over its lifetime. For assets that are being idled temporarily, that may mean companies \"could ride out for quite some time\" without taking impairments, Mr. McInnis said. </p><p>    McDonald's Corp. hasn't said whether it will take an accounting charge related to the closure of its 847 restaurants in Russia. Russia and Ukraine together contributed around 9% of the company's $23 billion global revenue last year. The burger chain has said the closures are temporary and it is keeping its 62,000 employees in Russia on the payroll. McDonald's didn't respond to requests to comment. </p><p>   Some companies are disposing of their Russian assets, rather than waiting. Heineken NV and Carlsberg A/S, the world's second- and third-largest global brewers, respectively, said last month they intend to exit Russia entirely. </p><p>   French bank Societe Generale SA has said its income would decline by more than $3 billion after it sells its stake in lender Rosbank and its Russian insurance units to one of the country's richest people. </p><p>   Societe Generale didn't disclose how much it is selling Rosbank for, but the French bank said the disposals would lead to a roughly 2 billion euros ($2.18 billion) write-off of the net book value of the sold assets, and a one-off noncash charge of about 1.1 billion euros. A company spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the previous disclosure. </p><p>   Oil-and-gas companies that have pledged to exit Russia typically are preparing to write off all the value of their assets. Exxon Mobil Corp. intends to exit its 30% stake in a massive oil-and-gas project it runs on Sakhalin Island in Russia's Far East. </p><p></p>",
