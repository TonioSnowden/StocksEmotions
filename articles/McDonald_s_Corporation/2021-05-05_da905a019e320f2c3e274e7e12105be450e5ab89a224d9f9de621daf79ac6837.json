  "title": "The Left vs. the Biden Jobs Boom",
  "text": "<p>\"The great economic boom of the 1990s lifted the fortunes of almost every disadvantaged group, including racial minorities, high school dropouts and single mothers,\" jubilated the Los Angeles Times in the late Clinton years.</p><p>\"America Is 'Fully Employed,' But Some Still Need Jobs,\" snarked the New York Times at the same stage of the Reagan boom.</p><p>A job may not be a solution for somebody who can't work or can't find a job, or who has behavioral problems or is disabled, but hiring binges are engines of social amelioration. We're on the cusp of such a boom now, or perhaps reacquainting ourselves with the Trump boom. Fifteen million job vacancies were begging by late March, five million more than before the pandemic. A McDonald's franchisee in Tampa is offering $50 to entice prospective workers to schedule an interview.</p><p>Perversely, the pandemic may be helping, keeping some experienced workers out of the job market and creating opportunities for others.</p><p>On the left, credible think tanks have advocated \"running a hot job market\" as a form of social policy. Now it falls to Joe Biden to husband this electoral gold for Democrats into 2022.</p><p>I've written before about the bad-policy buffer -- how much in anti-growth, anti-confidence gestures an otherwise sound economy can absorb. By his third reference in last week's congressional speech to taxpayers not paying their \"fair share,\" Mr. Biden seemed ready to fall to his knees and raise his fists to heaven. It won't surprise you that there's no metric for \"fair share\" but a big economic literature on deadweight loss -- how much it costs society to provide the government with a dollar of revenue. Mr. Biden's signature proposals, on capital gains and corporate income, are among the least efficient of all taxes.</p><p>His naggers to the left want a $15 minimum wage, a form of price regulation and a guarantee of joblessness for anybody whose productivity can't justify $15 an hour.</p><p>Every week he issues another $2 trillion spending plan so thinly fleshed out that it's obvious the White House is playing for a splashy headline, not a bill that will ever pass Congress or even be written.</p><p>The modern presidency is such a nonstop fusillade of verbal bushwa, it's hard to know when it's serious. Mr. Biden talks about saving the planet but has sent numerous signals that he will be satisfied with green pork. He and the godfather of his presidency, Rep. James Clyburn, are more focused on carefully meandering away from \"defund the police,\" which they know is death at the ballot box. Nor was Mr. Biden's ability to read the chessboard taxed by the choice to agree with Sen. Tim Scott's claim that \"America is not a racist country\" -- anything else would be death at the ballot box.</p><p>The 1994 crime bill. Forced busing in the 1970s. Coziness with Delaware's giant credit-card issuers. When Democrats tried to impeach Donald Trump over Ukraine, a bonus for some was the chance to air Biden family laundry as personified in son Hunter. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez chose the moment to lament that she was forced to share the Democratic Party with the likes of Joe.</p><p>Now he needs left-wing voters in the upcoming and typically low-turnout midterms. He knows their agenda is electoral poison. The balance point is becoming hard to ignore. If he can't give them policy victories, he can give them the white supremacist menace. Tom Edsall of the New York Times is their tribune. He once fretted that the racial obsessions of white progressives were a turnoff even to black voters. Now he supplies endless quotes from pet academics to certify that the Republican Party consists of racial reactionaries.</p><p>You haven't been paying attention if you haven't noticed that the Brian Sicknick investigation was deliberately dragged out by D.C. officials to delay confirming a statement by a named police union official on day one: Officer Sicknick died of a stroke. He wasn't murdered by pro-Trump insurrectionists, a false story planted by anonymous sources in the Times.</p><p>The whomping up of the right-wing extremist threat is an ugly part of Bidenism and catnip to left-wing extremists (we have both and they feed on attention). It brings electoral risks of its own so probably will be jettisoned in early 2022. In the meantime, consider it part of the price for the Biden jobs boom.</p>",
