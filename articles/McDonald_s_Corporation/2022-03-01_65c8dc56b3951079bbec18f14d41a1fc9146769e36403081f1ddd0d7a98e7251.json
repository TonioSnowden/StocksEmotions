  "text": "<p>Two days after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, the office of Volodymyr Zelensky released a video of the president and other top officials gathered outdoors at night-time in the heart of Kyiv's government complex.</p> <p>“We are all here defending our independence, our country and this will be the case going forward,” Zelensky said. “Glory to our defenders. Glory to Ukraine.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Despite some analysts questioning how resilient the Ukrainian state would be in the face of a Russian invasion — and the Kremlin's apparent belief that Zelensky would sue for peace within days — its government, economy and banking systems continued to function under emergency conditions, even as Russian troops surrounded the capital, Kyiv.</p> <p>“Our financial system is stable, the banking sector is working based on the rule of law, and we are making all the necessary social payments, like payments for disabilities, pensions for elderly people, and of course salaries,” Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's deputy prime minister, told the Financial Times in a video interview. “We are really happy and proud of the people in government who managed at a time of unprecedented war which the world has not seen in 75 years. We delivered on all of that.”</p> <p>For security reasons, officials are not disclosing information about their whereabouts, specific logistical arrangements or movements. </p> <p>“What a great question!” Stefanshinya said when pressed for information on the logistics of keeping the government running in a country under siege. “I will give you all the details in 12 months.”&#xa0;</p> <p>In a country that has been on a war footing with Russia since Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea and the subsequent conflict in the eastern Donbas region, the government had been laying the groundwork for operating under conditions of a full-scale attack for years.</p> <p>Kyiv's government quarter contains a labyrinth of underground passageways, and some MPs and government figures have dispersed to other parts of the city or elsewhere in Ukraine.</p> <p>In the immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion, Ukraine's parliament imposed martial law. Zelensky, as commander of the military, began ruling by decree and parliament suspended regular sessions. But MPs are still holding ad hoc meetings to help in areas such as co-ordinating humanitarian aid. &#xa0;</p> <p>“The military is running the country with the cabinet of ministers,” said Mariana Bezuhla, deputy chair of Ukraine's parliamentary committee on national security. “We are doing everything possible to provide support.”</p> <p>On Sunday, members of Ukraine's parliamentary finance and tax committee, working from their homes or underground shelters, convened a session, part of which was open to the public via Zoom link. </p> <p>The agenda included briefings by the central bank and from tax and customs officials about how the economy and public finance system were prepared to weather Russia's invasion by ground troops and missile attacks. </p> <p>“It doesn't help that we are underground or in metro stations, but we are trying to work, and everyone is trying to do everything we can,” Alyona Shkrum, an MP on the committee, said.</p> <p>After Thursday's invasion, Shkrum said: “We were told the first obligation is you have to stay alive; the second obligation is you cannot be captured by Russian forces, because if the Russian forces have MPs under their control, we will be forced to vote at gunpoint for some kind of capitulation.”</p> <p>She added: “The second order is more important.”</p> <p>Bezuhla, the MP, told the Financial Times key officials from Kharkiv had been moved before Russian forces on Tuesday shelled the city's main square, where government buildings are located. Many MPs were back in their constituencies, she added, to help manage the emergency, including supporting the flow of humanitarian aid. </p> <p>Supply chains have broken or been frayed in Kyiv and other cities, which have faced bread shortages and long queues at petrol stations and food stores. Some ATMs have run out of cash or imposed strict limits on withdrawals, but the banking system's electronic payments are still working. </p> <p>‘It's not like Russia, because we are linked to the world international system,” said Volodymyr Landa, deputy editor of Forbes Ukraine. “We can pay by cards in food stores. Electronic payments are still working.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Amid a surge of patriotism since the invasion, businesses have pitched into the war effort. Some companies have been paying salaries and taxes owed to the state in advance. </p> <p>McDonald's closed its fast-food restaurants for security reasons after the war started, but has been providing local governments with “products that do not require cooking”, such as rolls, doughnuts, milk, water and juices, the company said on Monday in a Facebook post with the hashtag #StandWithUkraine. Local restaurants from rival chain KFC said they were donating food for hospitals, territorial defence and the military. &#xa0;</p> <p>Zelensky's popularity has soared. A poll conducted at the weekend by agency Rating found that 91 per cent of 2,000 people surveyed said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the president's performance, up from about 60 per cent before the invasion. </p> <p>“He has resilience, passion and love for his people,” said Andy Hunder, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, which is operating from the western city of Lviv. “Cometh the hour, cometh the man.”</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/20f4f829-4ba6-4f25-9e51-8c19a2a8825b.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: John Reed in Lviv and Roman Olearchyk in Kyiv  2022 'Kyiv keeps wheels of state turning under Russian bombardment ' FT.com 1 March.
