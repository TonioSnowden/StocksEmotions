  "title": "Sanctions more than ethics have spurred corporate flight from Russia ",
  "text": "<p>Behold a heartwarming new world of ethically irreproachable self-sanitising supply chains, or that's the theory. On Tuesday, less than two weeks after Vladimir Putin's invasion, and citing the “needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine”, McDonald's symbolically <a href=\"https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/ourstories.Russia-update.html\">interrupted </a>more than 30 years of engagement with post-Communist Russia by temporarily closing its restaurants there. It was swiftly followed by Coca-Cola, Pepsi and Starbucks.</p> <p>Many of the corporate exits from Russia have involved companies not directly affected by sanctions. The big name before yesterday's gaggle of fast food and caffeine purveyors was Shell, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3d1d58a-b810-4200-aa52-27f3fedd0e5e\">announced</a> it would stop buying Russian oil even before a US and UK — still less an EU — embargo was in place. Minds may have been concentrated by a genuinely principled act, union-backed workers <a href=\"https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/workers-stanlow-oil-refinery-refuse-23295663\">refusing</a> to offload Russian oil to the Stanlow refinery in north-west England formerly owned by Shell, which it still supplies.</p> <p>Perhaps Putin has inadvertently achieved what thousands of earnest environmental, social and governance investment codes could not, and prompted companies to bring binding ethical judgments into their supply chain decisions. Sadly, that's a bit far-fetched. Looking at their operations in Russia and elsewhere, most multinationals seem far more driven directly or indirectly by official sanctions than by sudden fits of corporate conscience.</p> <p>The appearance of voluntary action may arise because it's not straightforward to map across specific European and US sanctions (for example, on banks and individuals) to companies <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-russia-corporations-that-have-pulled-out/\">ceasing Russian operations</a>. Few Hollywood studios, car producers, furniture stores, or consumer goods manufacturers have been directly forbidden from dealing with Russia, unlike exporters of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d0e97dd-b7e3-416c-98a0-a823838fbc96\">semiconductors </a>and other sensitive tech.</p> <p>But it doesn't seem likely that the precision-made accuracy of US and European sanctions on Russia has made such an impact. Instead, it's created an environment of such legal and financial hostility that risk-averse companies are staying clear. Being cancelled by indignant consumers is an important issue — that's probably what's driving the McDonald's and Coca-Cola decisions — but many corporates have more fundamental concerns. Will they unknowingly end up doing business with a sanctioned individual? Will they get prosecuted? Will they get paid? They might still earn profits in Russia, but can they get them out?</p> <p>The European sanctions on Russia are extraordinarily tough by historical standards, but the US remains by far the biggest player because of Washington's control of the dollar payments system, including the Swift messaging facility and the long reach of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a6613c7-f2f0-4111-aaca-88867c9b8a0a\">correspondent banking</a>. Compliance becomes so complicated that even if an activity or an entity isn't specifically sanctioned, any company wanting to retain access to the US banking and payments system needs a strong profit incentive to bother picking its way through the legal thicket.&#xa0;</p> <p>This is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acc48fc6-169a-11ea-b869-0971bffac109\">evident from Iran</a>, where the US's use of <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/03/04/how-sanctions-on-russia-will-alter-global-payments-flows-pub-86575\">secondary sanctions</a> — which threaten disconnection from the dollar payments system for companies doing business with banned entities — has deterred Europeans from transacting there. The EU, whose governments have a far less confrontational approach to relations with Tehran, has attempted legally to protect its companies via the so-called “<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/international-relations/blocking-statute_en\">blocking statute</a>”, which prohibits&#xa0;them from complying with extraterritorial foreign sanctions that the EU regards as illegal under international law. The EU set up a quasi-barter system called Instex which enables them to transact with Iran outside the dollar system. And yet European companies are keeping business transactions with Iran minimal, for fear of being cut off from US banking.&#xa0;</p> <p>The idea that US and European companies are independently developing a moral aversion to human rights abuses withers when confronted with their continued activities in autocracies such as China and Saudi Arabia. Those governments aren't Putin's Russia, but they do some pretty vile things, notably Saudi's <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/09/yemen-the-forgotten-war/\">indiscriminate bombing</a> of Yemeni civilians and China incarcerating a million Uyghurs in Xinjiang province.&#xa0;</p> <p>Both countries are generally <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2021/03/22/a-momentous-shift-in-us-public-attitudes-toward-china/\">unpopular</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/1/6/21050019/saudi-arabia-poll-unpopular\">American </a>and <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/10/06/unfavorable-views-of-china-reach-historic-highs-in-many-countries/\">European</a> <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/just-as-bad-as-each-other-what-the-british-public-think-of-saudi-arabia-iran-and-russia\">public</a> and yet multinationals maintain strong links there. In the UK, the Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich has decided to sell Chelsea FC, but a consortium led by Saudi's sovereign wealth fund owns Newcastle United. Volkswagen has stopped producing in and exporting to Russia and <a href=\"https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-stops-production-of-vehicles-in-russia-and-suspends-export-7771\">wrung its hands</a> piteously over violations of international law, but it's still happily building cars in Xinjiang. McDonald's <a href=\"https://www.mcdonalds.com.cn/news/20201225-new-restaurants-in-Xinjiang/\">opened two restaurants</a> in Xinjiang last year.</p> <p>The salient difference with Russia is that US and European governments aren't targeting Saudi and China with sanctions and turning public opinion further against them. Indeed, Joe Biden is <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/biden-saudi-trip-oil-b7a91070-8045-4155-9120-a35d59fd7603.html\">reportedly</a> asking Saudi Arabia to replace Russian oil. In Germany, a “<a href=\"https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/german-due-diligence-law/\">due diligence</a>” law making companies responsible for abuses in their supply chains — which would have focused attention on their Chinese operations — was watered down after pressure from German industry.</p> <p>The contrasting behaviour of rich world companies in different autocracies underlines that embargoes and boycotts don't generally just happen. Sanctions work when determined governments, particularly the US, weave dense webs of restrictions that warn companies to stay clear and lead public opinion towards the same conclusion. Jumping from Russia before you are pushed is self-interest: it is not an act of principle.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:alan.beattie@ft.com\"><em>alan.beattie@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Sign up for </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/trade-secrets\"><em>Trade Secrets</em></a><em>, the FT's newsletter on globalisation</em></p><p>Source: Alan Beattie 2022 'Sanctions more than ethics have spurred corporate flight from Russia ' FT.com 9 March.
