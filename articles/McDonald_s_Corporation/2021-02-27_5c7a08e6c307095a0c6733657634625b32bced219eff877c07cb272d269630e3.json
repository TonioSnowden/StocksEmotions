  "text": "<p>   The open-plan office was born in Germany in the 1950s, out of a belief that the walls and doors of traditional offices \"were barriers to communication, change and egalitarianism, and simply eliminating those partitions would fundamentally change the way people worked,\" writes Jennifer Kaufmann-Buhler in her new book \"Open Plan: A Design History of the American Office\" (Bloomsbury Visual Arts). The book includes a rich array of vintage photos tracing the development of the open-plan office in the U.S., such as McDonald's headquarters in Oak Brook, Ill., built in 1971, which featured a round meditation room with a 700-gallon water bed and a stereo system. </p><p>   In 1999, ad agency TBWA/Chiat/Day opened offices in a Los Angeles warehouse with shared \"cliff-dwelling\" workspaces in stacked shipping containers, as well as ficus trees and a basketball court. In 2015, Facebook created a  Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters of over 1 million square feet, the biggest open-plan office ever. The open-plan concept, Ms. Kaufmann-Buhler writes, \"has been repeatedly offered as a miraculous solution to various social, organizational, architectural and technological problems,\" but it has thrived because it lets companies \"fit more workers into less space.\" </p><p></p>",
