  "title": "Kearney Executive Expanded Scope of Business Consulting; Marvin Schiller, who has died at age 88, forged longer relationships with companies by increasing services and using performance-based fees",
  "text": "<p>Dr. Schiller rose through the ranks at Kearney as he showed an entrepreneurial instinct for consulting and an eye for expanding the firm's business with its clients beyond project-based work. He amassed a client list that included McDonald's Corp., Estee Lauder Cos., AT&amp;T and FedEx Corp. He became a partner in the firm in 1969.</p><p>Consulting firms during the 1950s and '60s were mostly limited to writing reports or conducting studies on specific problems identified by companies. A.T. Kearney &amp; Co., as it was known then, specialized in operational and corporate organization studies. Many of the reports languished at companies without ever being acted on.</p><p>Dr. Schiller created long-term engagements when companies often lacked in-house expertise in corporate restructuring, data analysis, automation, computers and buying supplies overseas.</p><p>Dr. Schiller died on Oct. 4 in Florida. He was 88 and had been under treatment for Alzheimer's disease and colon cancer.</p><p>\"He understood business situations and could size things up very quickly with clients,\" said Pat Byrne, a former chief operating officer for Kearney.</p><p>He guided Kearney's geographic expansion with offices in New York and California. His Kearney colleagues recalled him as an impeccable dresser with movie star looks. They said he also had a stern demeanor and a top-down management style that some of the firm's partners considered intimidating at times. But he was highly effective at convincing chief executives to embrace his recommendations and to hire Kearney to work on implementing them.</p><p>\"Clients would see him as somebody who is very smart, had a great presence and would tell them the truth, even if they didn't want to hear it,\" said Bob Duffy, a Kearney partner emeritus.</p><p>During the 1980s, Dr. Schiller was the first in the consulting industry to authorize the use of performance-based fees, said John Anderson, a Kearney partner for nearly 38 years. Kearney would defer some of its fees for a portion of the cost savings resulting from strategies the firm created and implemented. Kearney consultants began charging higher fees for work that yielded big improvements to clients' operations or business performance.</p><p>Performance fees became popular with companies because they considered the arrangements a way for consultants to be more invested in the outcomes of their work. Mr. Anderson said performance-based pricing is now widely used throughout the consulting industry.</p><p>\"Marvin really understood value pricing,\" Mr. Anderson said. \"He was the most articulate person I ever worked with.\"</p><p>Marvin Schiller, who was born in the Bronx, N.Y., on May 25, 1933, was the youngest of two children in his family. His father, a Russian immigrant, owned a mattress factory. An exceptional student, young Marvin skipped four grades in school and enrolled in Queens College in New York at age 15. As a high-school-age teen in college, he felt socially out of place and eventually dropped out. He joined the Army during the Korean War and was assigned to do evaluations on soldiers requesting mental-health services. The experience influenced his interest in studying psychology after mustering out of the military.</p><p>He completed a bachelor's degree at Queens College and then enrolled in Michigan State University, where he earned a master's degree and a Ph.D. in industrial psychology.</p><p>At Michigan State, he also met Nancy Klayf, who was a student there. They were married for 63 years and had three children.</p><p>He retired from Kearney at the end of 1994 as vice chairman of the firm. At the time, he was the second-largest shareholder in privately held Kearney, which was acquired by Electronic Data Systems Corp. in a 1995 cash-and-stock deal worth nearly $600 million.</p><p>Late in his career, Dr. Schiller and Nancy Schiller became advocates for mental-health treatment as they publicly shared their daughter Lori's long struggle with schizophrenia and the treatments to control the disease. After the Schillers moved to Boca Raton, Fla., from New York in the early 1990s, they started a life-skills program from their living room for people recovering from mental illness that later became the Welcome Home Program at a drop-in center in Delray Beach, Fla., operated by Ruth &amp; Norman Rales Jewish Family Services.</p><p>Dr. Schiller was an enthusiastic golfer and served as president of country clubs in New York and Florida. In his 70s, he played golf less often as he took up sculpting as a hobby. Ms. Schiller said he carved medium-size marble statues, including one of Buddha, based on statutes he saw in books or while traveling to other countries.</p><p>\"He had no idea he would be good at it,\" she said. \"He didn't know where [the talent] came from.\"</p><p>Write to Bob Tita at robert.tita@wsj.com</p><p>Kearney Executive Expanded Scope of Business Consulting</p>",
