  "title": "Business News:  McDonald's Plans for Downturn  ---  Burger giant's sales  growth hit by strong  dollar; company beats  earnings expectations  ----  By Heather Haddon",
  "text": "<p>   McDonald's Corp. said it is bracing for an economic downturn in the U.S. and Europe and it plans to keep its meals affordable relative to competitors to continue attracting consumers. </p><p>   The Chicago-based restaurant company said global same-store sales, or those in stores open at least 13 months, rose 9.5% during the latest quarter compared with the same period last year. Same-store sales increases in markets including the U.S., Germany, Australia and France were offset by challenges in China due to renewed government Covid-19 restrictions there, the chain said. </p><p>   McDonald's Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said business was strong despite broader economic concerns. \"There is increasing uncertainty and unease about the economic environment,\" Mr. Kempczinski said during an investor call Thursday. </p><p>   Some businesses are planning for a slowdown in the U.S. economy, with a number of companies slashing head count to try to shore up their balance sheets. New data Thursday showed the economy grew during the third quarter, but consumer spending cooled from July to September compared with the previous quarter. </p><p>   The burger chain said it expects increasing costs for food, materials and labor next year. </p><p>   Mr. Kempczinski said the company is planning for a mild to moderate recession in the U.S., and a potentially deeper and longer downturn in Europe. </p><p>   \"We are seeing consumer sentiment in Europe remain low,\" Mr. Kempczinski said. </p><p>   McDonald's said higher costs for energy, food and paper have particularly hurt its European franchisees, and it is prepared to back owners there with company funds on a limited basis. McDonald's provided cash to franchisees temporarily after the Covid-19 pandemic first hit to prop up owners experiencing sales losses. </p><p>   Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CEO Brian Niccol said Tuesday he expected a broader slowdown in consumer demand in the coming year, and though it has raised prices, the chain is promoting the restaurant brand's value. </p><p>   McDonald's said marketing featuring its core menu helped generate sales and bring in more orders in the U.S. during the quarter. The chain's Cactus Plant Flea Market Box, a Happy Meal geared toward adults, helped U.S. sales in the current quarter, with half of the toys selling out within days of its debut, the company said. </p><p>   Price increases also helped revenue. U.S. menu prices were up 10% on average in the third quarter compared with last year, McDonald's said. The company said it is trying to increase prices while still remaining a good value to customers seeking affordable meals. </p><p>   It said restaurants also are benefiting from prices rising faster at supermarkets than at eateries. </p><p>   For the third quarter, the weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar hurt McDonald's global revenue, despite higher menu prices and promotions helping to drive U.S. sales. </p><p>   The burger giant reported total sales of $5.87 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30, down 5% compared with the same period last year, but above the expectations of analysts polled by FactSet. McDonald's said its third-quarter revenue was up 2% compared with the same period in 2021 when accounting for the effects of currency fluctuations. </p><p>   McDonald's logged earnings of $2.68 a share on income of $1.98 billion, which fell 8% from the prior year. Per-share earnings were flat during the third quarter compared with the same period last year when accounting for foreign currencies, the company said. The results beat analysts' earnings expectations for the quarter. </p><p>   McDonald's said its exit from its Russian business led to a pretax charge of $1.28 billion for the nine months ended Sept. 30, while the sale of its Dynamic Yield technology system generated a $271 million gain. </p><p></p>",
