  "title": "Future of Everything: Sports:  New Rules  For Child  Athletes?  ----  By Louise Radnofsky",
  "text": "<p>   For almost four decades, Peter Donnelly has been pushing an idea he says others seemed to find unfathomable: When child athletes train hours a day, forgo a normal education and put themselves at regular risk of stress and injury, they're working, not playing -- and they need the legal protections that come with that. </p><p>   When it came to sport, \"there was a willful blindness to considering the negatives,\" says Dr. Donnelly, now an emeritus professor of the University of Toronto. \"What if McDonald's had the same accident rate, or anywhere that employs large numbers of young people, or schools? There would be huge commissions of inquiry, regulations and policies.\" </p><p>   Now, people may actually be listening to him. Dr. Donnelly was invited to write and deliver a white paper on the topic at a global conference last month in South Africa on the elimination of child labor. It's one of several signs for him that the idea of regulatory protections for young athletes could take hold in his lifetime. </p><p>   \"I'm going to be 79 . . . and I think, 'Am I going to see it?'\" he says. \"It's probably the best moment that I've seen.\" </p><p>   In recent years, revelations of widespread physical and emotional abuse stirred up by the Larry Nassar scandal, and then by a doping controversy involving a 15-year-old at the 2022 Winter Olympic Games, have cast a harsh spotlight on sports such as gymnastics and figure skating. This week, the International Skating Union, the governing body for figure skating and speed skating, voted to raise the minimum age requirement for senior-level competition from 15 to 17. </p><p>   Elite competitors in sports like these can practice 30 hours a week or more, performing dangerous skills, while barely in their teens. They are rarely subject to regulation -- in contrast to rules that govern what child actors can do, and the kind of restrictions that exist for college athletes, officially kept to 20 hours a week of participation by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. </p><p>   The implications of reconsidering child athletes as workers are varied, but could involve limits on training time, new standards and oversight for their training environments, and tougher rules on school attendance. Arguments for protections could even extend to minors competing on travel basketball or soccer teams, given that money is exchanged between adults for the athletes' participation. </p><p>   This concept is anathema to many administrators, parents and young athletes themselves, who say the children aren't being forced to pursue enviable dreams of glory. Indeed, they say, it's the children seeking long hours that build character and are essential if they are going to be successful in the sport they adore. Some also say it seems implausible that the children have an employer: It's not the parents paying coaches, nor the coaches getting paid, nor the national governing body taking them to competitions, where the athletes are primarily performing for themselves. </p><p>   But some former child athletes think their sports cultures could benefit from a shake-up, especially one that challenges the idea that more training hours are almost always better. </p><p>   \"The kids, they not only compete at how much they train -- and the parents and coaches, too -- but they also compete at who takes the least vacation,\" says Kiira Korpi, a Finnish champion figure skater who started her sport at the age of 4, was competing internationally at 11, and, at 33, has written and spoken out on what she experienced and what she saw. </p><p>   The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is one mechanism for enforcing protections for child athletes, Dr. Donnelly says. Countries such as Norway and Sweden have moved their youth sports programs under the guidelines of the convention, which effectively requires them to prioritize child welfare. </p><p>   In the U.S., there are indications that the theory of child-athlete labor could become a regulatory reality through other legal avenues. </p><p>   Michigan prosecutors last year were prepared to argue that the once-famed gymnastics coach John Geddert had profited from forced labor, the profit coming from the thousands of dollars a year he was paid to coach, and the forced labor depicted in examples where he had used his authority to coerce gymnasts to train through pain and injury. </p><p>   The case was never heard by a jury because Mr. Geddert -- described by his family as a devoted coach who loved his sport and his athletes -- died by apparent suicide the same day that two dozen human trafficking charges against him were announced. But the idea behind the prosecution is unlikely to fade away. </p><p>   As a law student at Marquette University in 2015, Kristin Hoffman argued in the Marquette Sports Law Review that child gymnasts and skaters could be regulated under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, or through an expansion of state laws for child actors, as well as by their sports organizations. Ms. Hoffman, now a Chicago-based lawyer focused on other areas, noted in her piece that she had been motivated to write it by her own childhood experience in gymnastics. </p><p>   The FLSA is an 83-year-old law best known for creating the right to a minimum wage, but it also prohibits \"oppressive child labor.\" </p><p>   It bars almost all work for the under-14s, with exceptions for activities such as casual babysitting and newspaper deliveries -- and child acting. It only permits work for 14- to 16-year-olds to the extent that it doesn't interfere with their schooling, and isn't in conditions that are bad for their health and well-being. </p><p>   A state entertainment-industry law like California's covering child actors, meanwhile, specifically restricts those aged 9 to 16 to a total of five hours of any kind of work on a day when school is in session, and seven hours when it is not. </p><p>   \"Elite child athletes could be considered employees under the FLSA and protected like other employed children,\" Ms. Hoffman wrote. </p><p>   The FLSA and other labor laws are constantly being reinterpreted through litigation -- and much of it is trending in the direction of major revenue-generating sports, at least, being work, said Daniel Altchek, a partner at Saul Ewing Arnstein &amp; Lehr LLP. </p><p>   \"The cases have definitely been moving towards, this is employment,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
