  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Business News:  Pilgrim's Pride Gets  Bid From Brazil's JBS  ----  By Dave Sebastian and Jacob Bunge",
  "text": "<p>   Brazilian meatpacking giant JBS SA said it plans to buy the portion of U.S. chicken processor Pilgrim's Pride Corp. that it doesn't already own, during a boom time for the chicken industry. </p><p>   The proposed offer, valuing Colorado-based Pilgrim's at about $6.5 billion, would fold the company further into JBS's global meat operations and take it private, JBS said. JBS already owns about 80% of Pilgrim's. </p><p>   The proposed deal is the second big chicken transaction to be announced this week. Sanderson Farms Inc., the third-largest U.S. chicken processor by volume, on Monday announced a $4.5 billion deal to sell itself to Cargill Inc. and Continental Grain Co., which run their own chicken businesses. </p><p>   U.S. poultry prices have surged this year as restaurants reopened for indoor dining and fast food chains, including McDonald's Corp. and Shake Shack Inc., rolled out new crispy chicken sandwiches. Wholesale prices for chicken breasts have roughly doubled since the beginning of the year, and wing prices have climbed to record levels. </p><p>   Pilgrim's in late July said it saw demand returning at its food-service business as more consumers got vaccinated and pandemic-related dining restrictions eased. Its second-quarter losses widened, though sales rose 29% as demand continued to recover from pandemic lows. </p><p>   Pilgrim's, established in 1946, is the second-largest U.S. chicken company by volume, running about 30 processing plants across the country along with dozens of hatcheries, feed mills and rendering operations. It has been expanding in organic chicken and has acquired other processed meat businesses, including a $952 million deal proposed in June for the United Kingdom and Ireland meats business of Kerry Consumer Foods. </p><p>   JBS's offer for Pilgrim's, at $26.50 a share in cash, represents a nearly 17% premium to Thursday's closing price of $22.68. JBS's proposal is subject to the approval of a special committee of Pilgrim's Pride board members. </p><p>   Shares of Pilgrim's Pride rose about 21% Friday. </p><p></p>",
