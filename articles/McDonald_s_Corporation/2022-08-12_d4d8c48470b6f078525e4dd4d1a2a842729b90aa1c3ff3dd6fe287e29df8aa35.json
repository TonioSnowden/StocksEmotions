  "text": "<p>    McDonald's Corp. will reopen some of its locations in Ukraine, about six months after Russia's invasion caused the fast-food chain to pause its operations there. </p><p>   \"We have decided to institute a phased plan to reopen some restaurants in Kyiv and western Ukraine, where other businesses have safely reopened,\" Paul Pomroy, McDonald's corporate senior vice president for international operated markets, said in an email message to employees. </p><p>   The company will be working to get the locations ready for reopening during the next few months, he said. He didn't say how many of the more than 100 stores it owns and operates in Ukraine would reopen, or provide a specific timeline. </p><p>   Ukrainian officials have said that businesses resuming operations in the country will support both Ukrainians and the economy. </p><p>   The capital city of Kyiv has somewhat returned to normal months after the invasion began, as the front lines of the conflict have been pushed farther away. The main effort in the war has been taking place in the Donbas area in eastern Ukraine. The only regional capital in Ukraine that Russia has captured since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion has been Kherson, which is in the southern part of the country. </p><p>   The fast-food chain closed its more than 800 restaurants in Russiain March. </p><p></p>",
