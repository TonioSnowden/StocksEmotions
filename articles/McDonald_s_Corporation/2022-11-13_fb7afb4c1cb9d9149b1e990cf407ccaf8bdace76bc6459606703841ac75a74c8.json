  "text": "<p>Pay for executive assistants varies by industry, too. Morgan Stanley is advertising an executive-assistant role that pays from $75,000 to $120,000. Hedge fund Two Sigma has a similar opening offering between $100,000 and $150,000. Queens College, part of the City University of New York, is looking for a confidential executive assistant, a role that pays around $70,000 to $79,000. Warner Bros. Discovery lists a role for talent executive assistant with a range of between about $60,000 and $111,000.</p><p>The listed ranges can help shed light on how companies make compensation decisions, a process that has long been a mystery to job seekers and employees. </p><p>Morgan Stanley is advertising an executive assistant role that pays up to $120,000.

Ms. Delgado accepted the job this fall and is relocating from California to New York City next month. \"Even to move internally within your organization, you can use the data in other job postings to negotiate a higher salary,\" the 30-year-old said.</p><p>Some employers are posting a single salary for certain roles. A general manager at a Panera restaurant in New York City lists a base salary of $83,500 rather than a range. At McDonald's a general manager can earn between $58,500 and $80,000 a year, while a Starbucks store manager will make between $64,400 and $97,200.</p><p>The owner of Ann Taylor is hiring for a marketing-operations manager for the retailer's Manhattan headquarters, with a salary range of $85,000 to $100,000. Uptown, Tiffany &amp; Co. is looking for a market-operations specialist who can expect to earn around $72,000 to $97,000.</p><p>Individuals should be cautious about drawing too many conclusions about salary ranges for jobs that look similar or even identical, said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at job site Indeed.</p><p>\"Those ranges refer to particular skills, what your experience looks like. Every input will move the range up or down,\" said Ms. Gudell. For an executive-level position, for example, a job managing global budgets would be worth more than one managing in-country budgets, she said. Many expectations and nuances of a job also won't be included in an online job posting, she added. \"It's not a perfect science.\"</p><p>Basit Dar, a client services analyst at an investment-banking firm in Manhattan, has lately been checking job listings for titles similar to his. He doesn't plan to leave his job, which mainly involves providing computer support to the firm's employees, but wants to see if his annual pay, at around $35,000, is in line with similar roles at other companies. Since he is a contractor who works through a staffing agency, Mr. Dar, 25, says his pay is lower than it might be for an in-house role.</p><p>He has looked up titles such as client services analyst, technical analyst, IT consultant and desktop engineer and found that the jobs have been largely comparable, he said.</p><p>The new law requires nearly all employers with staff in New York City to list pay on job postings, along with internal transfer or promotion opportunities. Companies hiring for remote positions that could conceivably be done from New York must also comply with the law and list minimum and maximum salary ranges, city officials have said.</p><p>New York's law doesn't require companies to include information on benefits, bonuses or additional stock-based compensation. Many employers note on listings that base pay can vary by location, skills and other factors. Though the law requires employers to post \"good-faith\" ranges, what that means in reality is up to some interpretation, executives say.</p><p>Companies that advertise the same jobs in multiple locations sometimes list different pay ranges. American International Group Inc., the insurer, for example, said it would pay between $140,000 and $175,000 a year for a senior compensation manager in New Yorkâ€”and 7% to 12% less across the Hudson River in Jersey City, N.J., which also requires pay ranges in job ads.</p><p>AIG declined to comment.</p><p>Regional pay disparities have always existed, but most workers haven't previously had much opportunity for direct comparisons, said Julia Pollak, chief economist at online job platform ZipRecruiter. \"Workers in other areas with lower costs of living are paid less, but that hasn't been so transparent or so easily detectable in the past.\"</p><p>Write to Lauren Weber at lauren.weber@wsj.com</p><p>Wanted: Paralegal.
