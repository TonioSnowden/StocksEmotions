McDonald's pays as low as $11 per hour.</p><p>Bitcoin BTCUSD was relatively stable on Monday after a turbulent weekend, trading above $35,000 , a far cry from the roughly $69,000 it was trading at in early November.</p><p>Under Bukele's direction, El Salvador has been buying bitcoin, and uniquely has adopted it as legal tender. Coindesk reports the country now holds over 1,500 bitcoin, worth some $53 million in fiat Yankee dollars.</p><p>Financial markets have not been impressed. Since El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender, its 5-year credit default swaps have surged to 1,812.81 , from 412.54, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>",
