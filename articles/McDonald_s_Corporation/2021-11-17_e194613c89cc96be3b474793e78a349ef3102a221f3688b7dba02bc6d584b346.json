  "text": "<p>Shareholders rightly demand the sacking of chief executives when corporate performance flags or bad behaviour demands change. This month, Barclays investors are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/654a345c-d0e6-4ff9-a5bd-5e740ad59fd0\">questioning the board</a> over its own performance following the pay award given to erstwhile CEO Jes Staley. Staley resigned by mutual agreement following a regulatory investigation into his description of his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p> <p>Given the nature of his departure, it is not surprising that a generous farewell is unpopular. The Investor Forum, which engages with UK companies in the name of big investment managers and pension funds, has received complaints from three members about Staley's lucrative send off. This includes the remainder of his £2.4m salary plus another £120,000 in pension payments for the year.</p> <p>Yet failing some new, damning evidence from the FCA, the payments will be made. </p> <p>Any pay deal between the Barclays board, led by chair Nigel Higgins, and Staley is likely to fall under the contractual terms of payment in lieu of notice — a PILON. These must go ahead unless the board has sufficient evidence of gross misconduct. Dismissing Staley without adhering to severance clauses would have created the opportunity for lawsuits. That could breach the board's fiduciary responsibilities. </p> <p>Severance payments have been handed out to CEOs departing in controversial circumstances before, including Martin Sorrell from WPP. Some are more contested than others. McDonald's sued former CEO Steve Easterbrook in 2020, long after he left the company, seeking to recover payments.<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/05/19/business/economy-stock-market-news\"> Investors continue to pursue the board </a>over its handling of Easterbrook's dismissal.</p> <p>Executive bonus schemes can be more easily halted in the event of&#xa0;misconduct. Past remuneration can be clawed back, and bonuses and incentive share plans cancelled, via so-called malus clauses.</p> <p>Both Barclays and disgruntled shareholders need a clearer steer from the FCA on the Staley investigation. The board has stood by Staley. Without proof of wrongdoing, the bank can hardly avoid fulfilling its obligations. A final report, or at least an update, from the FCA will come this month. As Staley has stated his intent to clear his name, the process is likely to go on well past the normal deadline.</p> <p>The Barclays board will remain in the spotlight throughout the process. One question it can expect to be asked is whether it hired the right man in the first place.</p><p>Source:  2021 'Barclays/Jes Staley: pay-off may grate, but it remains on the cards' FT.com 17 November.
