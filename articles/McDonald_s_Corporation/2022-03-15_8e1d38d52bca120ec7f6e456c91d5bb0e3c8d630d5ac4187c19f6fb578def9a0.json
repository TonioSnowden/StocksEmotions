  "text": "<p>Imperial Brands, the maker of Gauloises and Davidoff cigarettes, plans to transfer its Russian operations to a “local third party”, a means of exiting the country that rival British American Tobacco has said would avoid retaliation from Russian authorities. </p> <p>The London-listed company, which employs 1,000 people in Russia and has a factory in the south-western city of Volgograd, said on Tuesday that it had “begun negotiations with a local third party about a transfer of our Russian assets and operations”.</p> <p>Russian president Vladimir Putin's decision to send troops into Ukraine last month has sparked a corporate exodus from Russia, with groups from McDonald's to BP announcing plans to exit or suspend their operations. </p> <p>As the wave of companies disavowing Russia has grown, Putin said last week that the country would find “legal solutions” to seize assets from international groups that had decided to close their operations in the country. “With regards to those who are planning to close their production facilities, we must act decisively,” Putin said.</p> <p>Imperial said last week that it was merely suspending operations in Russia. The company on Tuesday declined to comment on Putin's threat to seize assets and said its means of exiting was taken in the best interests of Imperial's local workforce. </p> <p>“Clearly, there is a benefit to doing this in an orderly way rather than in a disorderly way,” the group said.</p> <p>Imperial's decision to transfer assets to a local third party follows a similar move from BAT on Friday. Announcing its decision, Kingsley Wheaton, chief marketing officer at BAT, told the Financial Times that suspending activities or closing operations in Russia, rather than transferring them, would be regarded as “deliberate bankruptcy” and could lead to criminal charges being brought against the company's management.</p> <p>“[Russia] will regard that as deliberate bankruptcy and . . . will pursue management of the company and potentially bring criminal charges,” he added.</p> <p>Imperial said its staff in Russia would continue to be paid while talks continued with the local third party, which it declined to give any further details on. </p> <p>Russia accounted for only a fraction of Imperial's revenues and earnings, so there would be a “relatively small impact” from its exit, with its full-year revenue guidance little changed.</p> <p>The move by Imperial came on the same day that Inchcape, one of the UK's largest car distributors, also announced plans to “transition” its operations in Russia, which generated about 10 per cent of its sales last year. </p> <p>“In light of the current circumstances, we have concluded that the group's ownership of its business interests in Russia is no longer tenable,” said Inchcape. “Therefore, working in conjunction with our OEM [carmaker] partners, we have initiated a process to transition our Russian business.”</p> <p><em>With additional reporting by Peter Campbell in London</em></p><p>Source: Ian Johnston in London 2022 'Gauloises maker Imperial Brands to make full exit from Russia ' FT.com 15 March.
