  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Musk Urges McDonald's to Take Dogecoin Payments  ----  By Omar Abdel-Baqui",
  "text": "<p>   Elon Musk wants McDonald's Corp. to start accepting dogecoin for payment. </p><p>   \"I will eat a happy meal on tv if @McDonalds accepts Dogecoin,\" Mr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla Inc., said in a tweet Tuesday. He has repeatedly touted dogecoin, including this month when he said Tesla would accept the cryptocurrency for payment for some merchandise. </p><p>   The price of dogecoin rose 3.2% Tuesday, according to Kraken Data. </p><p>   McDonald's later tweeted \"only if @Tesla accepts grimacecoin,\" in reference to the purple character featuring in some of the fast-food company's ads. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   The tweets come after cryptocurrency prices -- including dogecoin -- have fallen sharply in recent days. </p><p>   Dogecoin, initially started as a joke in 2013, is in the top 10 by market value for cryptocurrencies, according to CoinMarketCap. Its value tends to fluctuate based on what Mr. Musk says about the volatile cryptocurrency. </p><p>   When pressed to explain what dogecoin was during a \"Saturday Night Live\" performance in May 2021, Mr. Musk, who was hosting the show, eventually said, \"Yeah, it's a hustle,\" which sent the cryptocurrency's price falling. </p><p>   The price of dogecoin has lost roughly 80% of its value since Mr. Musk's SNL appearance. </p><p>   In addition to accepting dogecoin for payment for some merchandise, Tesla last year bought $1.5 billion in bitcoin. While Mr. Musk initially said Tesla would also accept payments in bitcoin, the company later suspended that initiative after Mr. Musk expressed concerns about high levels of fossil-fuel use for bitcoin mining. </p><p></p>",
