  "text": "<p>McDonald's &amp; Its Franchisees</p><p>* McDonald's to Back Diverse Restaurant Owners (Dec. 8, 2021)</p><p>* The Franchise Relationship That Powers Small Business Is Fraying (Nov. 30, 2020)</p><p>* McDonald's Seeks Dismissal of Discrimination Lawsuit Filed by Black Former Franchisees (Oct. 23, 2020)</p><p>* McDonald's, Chipotle and Domino's Are Booming During Coronavirus While Your Neighborhood Restaurant Struggles (Oct. 12, 2020)</p><p>* McDonald's Franchisees Plan Push for Stronger Sales (Oct. 10, 2018)</p><p>* McDonald's Franchisees Grumble That Restaurants Are No Cash Cow (Oct. 9, 2018)</p><p>In a shift that could affect some of the chain's longest-tenured restaurant operators, McDonald's is also requiring that next-generation heirs put up more cash to keep operating their locationsâ€”and to designate a single family member as the operator. Current McDonald's franchisees can designate several heirs, such as the children of a parent owner, to take over their McDonald's restaurants as part of their agreement with the chain.</p><p>\"This change is in keeping with the principle that receiving a new franchise term is earned, not given,\" McDonald's said in the message to franchisees regarding the changes.</p><p>Franchisees run 95% of the company's U.S. restaurants. McDonald's anticipates it will begin to implement the franchising changes next January.</p><p>McDonald's, the world's biggest fast food chain, relies heavily on its franchisees, who own and operate McDonald's locations while paying the chain royalties to use its branding, marketing and supply chain.</p><p>The arrangement, which is also used by fast food giants like Wendy's Co. and Burger King, is a way for restaurant companies to focus on high-level operations while entrusting day-to-day operations to individual operators, who maintain a stake in the performance of each restaurant.</p><p>The pandemic fueled tensions between many franchisees and corporate parents across restaurants, hotels and retail shops, as both sides navigated an unprecedented disruption to business. Franchisees pushed back on store upgrades, promotional discounts and fees they said were excessive in light of the crisis. Companies imposed shifting rules in response to changing government mandates.</p><p>Many fast-food restaurant chains recovered their sales from the pandemic last year as Americans flocked to their drive-throughs, boosting franchisee profits. Valuations of chain restaurant franchises grew, prompting turnover as some owners retired and sold their businesses.</p><p>Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com</p><p>McDonald's Tightens Restaurant Ownership Rules as it Looks for New Franchisees</p>",
