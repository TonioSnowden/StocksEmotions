  "text": "<p>The suspect in a New York City subway shooting that left 10 people wounded and traumatised the city was arrested by police on Wednesday and charged in federal court.</p> <p>Frank James, 62, had been sought by police after Tuesday's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7389c4e-a2d4-4829-a21e-b047d4d66bfa\">attack</a>. He was apprehended without incident in Manhattan's East Village after a tip, police said. Several US media outlets later reported that the tip came via a phone call from James himself.</p> <p>James, who has previously posted rants on social media about race, mental health and other matters, was upgraded from a “person of interest” to a suspect in the investigation on Wednesday morning. He was the subject of an extensive manhunt that involved hundreds of detectives. </p> <p>“My fellow New Yorkers, we got him. We got him,” Eric Adams, the city's mayor, announced on Wednesday afternoon. &#xa0;</p> <p>According to police, James boarded a Manhattan-bound N train on Tuesday morning and detonated two smoke grenades at 8.24am before firing at least 33 bullets from a 9mm handgun at fellow passengers. He was wearing a gas mask, construction helmet and an orange high-visibility vest.</p> <p>Among his belongings found at the scene were a hatchet, gasoline and a key to a U-Haul rental van that police later recovered in Brooklyn. That helped them identify James as a suspect.</p> <p>“We hope this arrest brings some solace to the victims and the people of the city of New York,” said Keechant Sewell, New York police commissioner.</p> <p>James has been arrested on nine previous occasions in New York, according to police, including for possession of burglary tools and a criminal sex act. He also has three previous arrests in New Jersey, they said. The gun he allegedly used in the attack was purchased in Ohio in 2011.</p> <p>James has been charged in federal court with conducting a terror attack on mass transit. Authorities did not say what the motive was for the attack.</p> <p>Responding to the tip, police originally searched a McDonald's restaurant in the East Village for James. They later found him nearby, at St Mark's Place and First Avenue.</p> <p>Tuesday's attack crystallised residents' fears that New York was sliding back towards its violent past after a surge in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a444b43e-ba40-48b5-a064-fa51c591cc32\">shootings and hate crimes</a> that began during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The subway has been a particular source of concern. Several employers said that it had become the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f988ad5-5cb8-424f-bce4-ce71ed42f16e\">biggest obstacle to convincing</a> their employees to return to the office. That, in turn, is hampering the city's ability to recover from the pandemic-induced shutdown and clouding its prospects.</p> <p>Police said they believed James had evaded capture by quickly boarding another train, although they cautioned that it was early in the investigation.</p><p>Source: Joshua Chaffin in New York 2022 'Subway attack suspect arrested in New York City' FT.com 13 April.
