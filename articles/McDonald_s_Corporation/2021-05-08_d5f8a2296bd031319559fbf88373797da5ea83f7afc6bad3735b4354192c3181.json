For everyone else, let's go.</em></p> <h1>Olympic sponsors' silence on Xinjiang is telling</h1> <p>It has been nearly a decade since an <strong>Olympic Games </strong>without a geopolitical or public health crisis in the run-up.</p> <p>There was a gay rights controversy before <strong>Sochi 2014</strong>, the Zika virus before <strong>Rio de Janeiro 2016</strong>, nuclear tensions with North Korea prior to <strong>Pyeongchang 2018</strong>, and <strong>Tokyo 2020</strong> was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p><strong>Beijing 2022</strong> is no different. Western governments, including the US and UK, have labelled China's treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang a genocide. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92d57e46-4c63-46f2-be08-de8a9954256e\">Talks over a potential Olympic boycott</a> are as real as they have been in a generation.&#xa0;</p> <p>That is causing hand-wringing among Olympic sponsors, with conversations about Xinjiang “swirling” among the games' commercial partners. The Financial Times contacted dozens of companies that are sponsoring Beijing 2022 and <strong>Team USA</strong> to inquire about these concerns. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf07dfb7-f70a-4008-8ab1-2b23bfbfb84d\">All but two did not comment</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The gulf between behind-the-scenes queasiness over Xinjiang and public reticence to speak out has serious implications.</p> <p>For one thing, sponsors can't simply plunk down hundreds of millions for marketing rights to gain the brand exposure of the Olympics as a global event, but avoid criticism that comes with related geopolitical issues.&#xa0;</p> <p>For another, the <strong>International Olympic Committee </strong>cannot afford a sponsor revolt, since corporate backers comprise nearly one-fifth of its revenue.&#xa0;</p> <p>Even before Xinjiang became a focus, some large multinationals had decided that the Olympics are no longer worth the cost. <strong>McDonald's</strong> and <strong>General Electric</strong> each ended their decades-long partnerships with the IOC before the Beijing 2022 cycle.</p> <p>The IOC is already reforming the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/594d2320-5326-11e6-9664-e0bdc13c3bef\">bidding process</a> for host cities, partly in response to public referendums in many Western cities rejecting the multibillion-dollar expenses of hosting the games.&#xa0;</p> <p>China's treatment of Uyghurs is a grave concern that goes far beyond the scope of sports marketing. It could well prompt a rethink of just what risks Olympic sponsors are willing to take.&#xa0;</p> <p><em>Read the FT analysis of Olympic sponsors' silence on Xinjiang </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf07dfb7-f70a-4008-8ab1-2b23bfbfb84d\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Football's next battle: owners versus the fans</h1> <p>Singaporean billionaire <strong>Peter Lim</strong> owns <strong>Valencia CF</strong>, one of Spain's biggest football clubs. Fans complain he uses their team for personal enrichment, such as speculating on players by trading in Europe's multibillion-euro transfer market.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I can do 101 things to make money, and money that I believe I can better control,” said Lim, in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7611e5f0-f1fc-4f5e-8983-4e4e1c263324?\">wild, forthright interview</a> with the FT this week. “This is something quite nice. I wake up, I own a football club and I see what happens next. It's nothing more.”</p> <p>For Lim, Valencia is a “trophy asset”, one that allows him to socialise with the sport's rich and famous. He has no desire to sell, but believes the club is worth substantially more than the €100m he spent to acquire a majority stake in 2014. Instead, Lim has engaged in a fire sale of players, arguing runaway spending on footballers is no longer sustainable.&#xa0;</p> <p>This approach to club ownership reveals a growing disconnect between some wealthy overseas investors drawn to the sport's huge global audiences, and local fanbases who still view football clubs as primarily a source of community pride.</p> <p>That chasm has been exposed further by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17139eed-0ca9-44e2-b3d5-afde0f63fc10\">botched</a> launch of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1af5993-21ed-4b92-9679-27f71482f76d\">breakaway</a> <strong>European Super League</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Last weekend, <strong>Manchester United</strong> fans, protesting against the US billionaire <strong>Glazer family</strong> that owns the English club, even <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a083a4e-8f29-4f0c-9277-b8bcf8c48ccf\">stormed the pitch</a> at Old Trafford in angry scenes.&#xa0;</p> <p>Growing discontent has led fans to seek ways to engage in the running of their clubs.</p> <p>In Valencia's case, <strong>Libertad VCF</strong>, a supporter's group, is <a href=\"https://libertadvcf.com/\">attempting to corral thousands</a> of individual Valencia shareholders to join forces with a combined 5 per cent stake. At that threshold, under Spanish law, the group can better scrutinise club operations, such as gaining access to contracts or appointing a board member.&#xa0;</p> <p>Changes are afoot elsewhere. <strong>Chelsea</strong> said this week that three supporters will be invited to attend board meetings and participate in the club's decision making process. The UK government has begun a “fan-led review of football governance” in the country.</p> <p>Some English fans would love to adopt German football's “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b6146cc-11a3-11e8-940e-08320fc2a277\">50+1</a>” system, where in most cases, clubs must be majority-owned by their members.&#xa0;</p> <p>That model has its drawbacks, such as making clubs unattractive to foreign investors. That helps to partly explain why <strong>Bundesliga</strong>, Germany's top tier, is dominated by <strong>Bayern Munich</strong>, the nation's wealthiest club and a darling of German corporate sponsors. Still, attempts to tweak the 50+1 system have failed thanks to resistance from fan groups.</p> <p>Fans across Europe are increasingly seeking a seat in boardrooms, not just in the stands. Rich owners may find supporters can no longer be easily ignored.</p> <p><em>Read the FT's interview with Valencia's Peter Lim </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7611e5f0-f1fc-4f5e-8983-4e4e1c263324?\"><em>here</em></a><em> and the statistical analysis of Manchester United under the Glazers </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f52a13bf-a772-47d9-9378-6146532c02d9?\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Apollo's $5bn sporting bet on Yahoo</h1> <p>Since the heady days of the dotcom boom, <strong>Yahoo</strong>, the internet darling of the late 90s and early 2000s, has been spiralling into oblivion. Respected tech executives such as <strong>Marissa Mayer</strong> and <strong>Tim Armstrong</strong> all miserably failed to return the Silicon Valley company to its past glories.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Apollo </strong>has other ideas. This week, the US investment firm <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef0992ec-1d4f-4030-95a9-d950e47338e1\">agreed to pay $5bn</a> to <strong>Verizon</strong> to purchase Yahoo and other digital properties. <strong>David Sambur</strong>, co-head of private equity at the firm, told Scoreboard that buying Yahoo isn't the most obvious deal out there, but “that's on purpose”.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>What Apollo has spotted, believing others haven't, is that hundreds of millions of sports fans hit up Yahoo's web pages. The private equity firm believes it can turn those fans into sports-betting, cash-generating customers.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Yahoo is the number four global internet property with 900 million monthly active users, a huge customer base,” said Sambur. “So there are tons of opportunities with the sports asset”.</p> <p>Technically, Yahoo already has a sports betting business but what it lacks are gambling licences. Apollo has more than 200 licences in the US and elsewhere, which could come in handy as more states have legalised US sports betting since a federal ban on it was struck down in 2018.</p> <p>Moreover, Apollo has a ton of experience in gambling.&#xa0;</p> <p>It has had a few home runs, such as its takeover of UK bookmaker <strong>Gala Coral</strong> in 2010, which later merged with <strong>Ladbrokes. </strong>It has also had its share of spectacular failures, such as its acquisition of <strong>Harrah's Entertainment</strong> (aka <strong>Caesars</strong>) in 2008 for $31bn, which subsequently went bankrupt.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>To be sure, Apollo isn't the first firm with gambling finesse to link up with sports media. Most notably, in January 2020 casino firm <strong>Penn National Gaming</strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4be0d6d3-ccab-48df-83e4-0b726273ccac\"> acquired a one-third stake</a> in sports blog <strong>Barstool Sports</strong> for $163m in cash and stock.&#xa0;</p> <p>The playbook effectively amounts to gambling companies paying for customers. Wall Street has kept a close eye on those acquisition costs, which some estimates have hovering between $300 and $800 per punter.&#xa0;</p> <p>So far, Penn's share price has more than tripled since linking up with Barstool. Apollo is betting that it can ride the same wave.&#xa0;</p> <p><em>Read the FT analysis of the Apollo bid for Yahoo </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8144393-48b6-4b92-81b7-47ad69d17b7c\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h2>Highlights </h2> <ul>  <li><p>The organisers of the<strong> Indian Premier League </strong>were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92b615cd-6610-4628-95a7-d394db690912\">forced to suspend</a> the lucrative cricket tournament after several players tested positive for Covid-19.
