  "text": "<p>Band members said they were devastated by the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes in the U.S. and wanted to speak out against the discrimination.</p><p>\"Everyone has their own history,\" said V, another BTS member. \"We hope today is one step forward to respecting and understanding each and every one as a valuable person.\"</p><p>There were 279 anti-Asian hate crimes reported in the U.S. in 2020, according to the most recent available data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. That is a 77% increase from the previous year, according to the FBI.</p><p>Mr. Biden signed legislation last year strengthening the country's response to hate crimes in the wake of recent violence against Asian-Americans. The law designated an official at the Justice Department to expedite the review of hate crimes and requires the attorney general to issue guidance to state and local law-enforcement agencies on how to establish online reporting for hate crimes.</p><p>It's not the first time a musician has stood at the press briefing podium. Last summer, pop star Olivia Rodrigo promoted Covid-19 vaccines.</p><p>BTS has become one of the most popular bands in the world, selling millions of singles and breaking online viewership records. Their impact extends beyond music. When McDonald's Corp. hired them to endorse a meal, the company said, it led to an increase in sales.</p><p>BTS played four shows in Las Vegas in April, the K-pop band's first in-person shows in the U.S. since it went on break in December. The band took time off to spend the holidays with family and friends, according to the group's management company Big Hit Music.</p><p>More than 250,000 people tuned in Tuesday to the live feed of the press conference on YouTube, according to the streaming site. Fans also lined up outside of the White House in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the band.</p><p>\"We still feel surprised that music created by South Korean artists reaches so many people around the world, transcending languages and cultural barriers,\" said Jungkook, another band member.</p><p>Write to Joseph De Avila at joseph.deavila@wsj.com</p><p>BTS Discusses Anti-Asian Discrimination With Biden in White House Visit</p>",
