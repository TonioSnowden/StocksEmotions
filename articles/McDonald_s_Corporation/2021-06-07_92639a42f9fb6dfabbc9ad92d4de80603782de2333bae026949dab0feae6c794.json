  "text": "<p>   By the time Robert Misener heard about GameStop Corp.'s frenzied rally in January, the meme stock was already well on its way to becoming a national sensation. For the 50-year-old Florida resident, it was a signal to buy. </p><p>   Mr. Misener, who in the past had largely invested in blue-chip companies, was gripped by a fear of missing out and excited by talk of squeezing hedge funds. He pulled the trigger, near the top, buying as high $349.48 a share. </p><p>   Then, the videogame retailer's stock crashed -- and crashed hard. Within days, it appeared Mr. Misener's hopes for big gains had evaporated. </p><p>   Mr. Misener's story could have ended there. Instead, in February, as GameStop's stock careened toward $40, Mr. Misener did what at the time seemed unthinkable: He kept buying. Amid the wreckage, he started discovering there was a lot to like about GameStop, he said. He bought in again, and again -- seeing it as an investment in the company's future. </p><p>   Today, Mr. Misener has earned more than $18,500 in paper profits from his GameStop position, buoyed in part by a surprise resurgence in meme stocks over the past two weeks. GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and other stocks popular with individual investors on social media have soared and swung wildly in recent sessions, even as the broader stock market has been stuck in place. </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 logged a modest 0.6% advance last week, while GameStop climbed 12%, building on the previous week's 26% rally. With an outperformance like that, many individual traders said, it is hard not to be loyal. </p><p>   Mr. Misener is one of several traders who have transformed into GameStop true believers, amassing large positions in the stock, with no intention of selling soon. Some, like Mr. Misener, had never stepped foot in a GameStop store or spent much time playing videogames. Now, hardly a day goes by when GameStop isn't on their minds. </p><p>   Individual investors' gamble on GameStop earlier this year has often been framed as an impulsive, adrenaline-fueled bet, led by online traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum. Many don't deny at least some of that is true. But many said they have also turned their positions into an opportunity to get in early on a company that they expect will look drastically different in a year's time. </p><p>   \"Tesla had naysayers and Amazon had people who were against it, but it's those two companies, and now GameStop, that are transforming a whole mind-set and methodology for how to do business,\" said Mr. Misener, a manager at a tech-services company. \"This could be huge.\" </p><p>   Driving that theory for many traders is one man: Ryan Cohen, the co-founder of pet-supply retailer Chewy Inc., who has ascended within months from GameStop's activist investor to the company's nominee for chairman. Only in his 30s, Mr. Cohen has been called an e-commerce wunderkind after selling Chewy to PetSmart Inc. for $3.35 billion. </p><p>   Many individual investors are betting Mr. Cohen can replicate that success at GameStop by steering the company into the digital age and away from years of declining revenue and failed experiments. As evidence, some point to GameStop's recent hires with ties to e-commerce, as well as Mr. Cohen's November letter to GameStop's board. In that, he emphasized the need for GameStop to become a \"technology-driven business\" that offers competitive pricing and strong customer service. Investors are hoping for further insight from GameStop Wednesday, when it announces its first-quarter earnings and holds its annual shareholders meeting. </p><p>   In a recent securities filing, GameStop acknowledged the need to respond to the shifting landscape. But making the transition won't be easy, especially in an industry that is growing increasingly competitive. </p><p>   Like other companies, GameStop is emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic with a loyal band of shareholders that it didn't have a year ago -- some of whom could transform into customers. Both GameStop and AMC have taken advantage of the meme-stock mania by selling more stock to strengthen their balance sheets. GameStop also announced recently it had taken steps to eliminate long-term debt. </p><p>   Many skeptics have warned that a meaningful transformation will take time and that the company has yet to reveal much about specific next steps for how it will reinvent itself. They also have cautioned that GameStop, on a fundamental basis, isn't worth its current stock price. GameStop shares closed Friday at $248.36, a more than 1,200% increase in 2021 that gives it a market value of about $17.5 billion. In contrast, Michael Pachter, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities, has a $39 price target and a sell rating on the stock. </p><p>   \"There is a disconnect between fundamentals and valuation,\" Mr. Pachter said. \"And Ryan Cohen still hasn't told us what his strategy is.\" </p><p>   Unlike pet supplies, which are typically recurring purchases, Mr. Pachter said, videogame customers don't tend to buy with as much regularity. Plus, he noted, GameStop still has a vast network of about 4,800 stores -- and recently made public the coming departure of Chief Executive George Sherman. </p><p>   Many individual investors said Mr. Cohen's bold approach with GameStop leadership is what earned their trust. It also simultaneously thrust him to celebrity status on forums like WallStreetBets. There, users call him \"Daddy Cohen,\" while swapping ideas on the meaning behind his cryptic tweets. One February tweet, of a frog emoji and a picture of an ice cream cone from McDonald's Corp., sent individual investors into a frenzy and coincided with a 104% one-day jump in GameStop shares. </p><p></p>",
