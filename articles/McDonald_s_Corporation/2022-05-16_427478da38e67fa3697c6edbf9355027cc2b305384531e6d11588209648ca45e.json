  "title": "McDonald's exit from Russia puts growth plans in disarray, analyst says; McDonald's operations in Russia will be a hard sell, GlobalData says, driving as much as a $1.4 billion charge",
  "text": "<p>McDonald's is looking for a local Russian buyer — and the name, logo, branding and menu will be removed from the sold locations. It expects to take a primarily non-cash charge of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion.</p><p>\"The fact that McDonald's owns most of its restaurants in Russia means there is an asset rich business to sell. However, given the circumstances of the sale, the financial challenges faced by potential Russian buyers, and the fact that McDonald's will not license its brand name or identity, it is unlikely the sale price will be anywhere near the pre-invasion book value of the business,\" GlobalData said.</p><p>McDonald's MCD news comes after many companies announced their departure from the country, or plans to otherwise cease business relations or investment there. McDonald's previously announced the closure of its 850 locations in the region. The company says it will continue to pay its workers until a deal is sealed.</p><p>See: Franchisees still operating in Russia have generated backlash. Here's why restaurant chains still favor this business model.</p><p>Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said in Monday's letter that McDonald's has become convinced of its inability to do business there after asking a set of questions, including \"Is our presence in the market brand-enhancing to our global operations? And does it make good business sense?\"</p><p>\"Unfortunately, the answer to each of these questions is currently no — and I don't see that changing for the foreseeable future,\" Kempczinski said.</p><p>McDonald's stock is down 9.2% for the year to date while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA has slumped 11.4% for the period.</p><p>McDonald's exit from Russia puts growth plans in disarray, analyst says</p>",
