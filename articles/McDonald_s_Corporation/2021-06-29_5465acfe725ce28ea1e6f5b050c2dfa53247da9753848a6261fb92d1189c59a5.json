  "title": "Hands Off The Chocolate Fountain --- Buffets are back -- with new policies and gloves",
  "text": "<p>Supermarkets and restaurants are restocking self-serve food bars that they closed last year. But the spreads can be different. Complimentary gloves are offered near the utensils. Reservations may be required. The chocolate fountain is roped off.</p><p>Some buffets are offering fewer items as labor and food costs balloon. Sometimes employees have to serve the food behind plexiglass, instead of allowing guests to serve themselves.</p><p>None of that bothers Kevin Schu. \"It felt like a blessing,\" said Mr. Schu, 34, who went with a friend to Yummy Buffet in Coal Township, Pa., at the end of last month to find a packed restaurant. He had soup, sushi rolls, sesame seed balls and ice cream. \"It felt amazing,\" said Mr. Schu.</p><p>Outside of Chicago, in Cicero, Ill., locals have awaited the opening of a new Golden Corral buffet. A line of several dozen people stretched outside into the parking lot by a nearby Walmart on opening day last month. Some dressed up for the occasion.</p><p>Alma Sanchez, a dental assistant working inside the local Walmart, brought her partner, in-laws and six kids. Ms. Sanchez, 34, who got drive-through food only occasionally at McDonald's at the height of the pandemic, was delighted that she could eat with her family though she asked for a table farther away from the crowds and sanitized everything in her midst.</p><p>\"I tried everything. Everybody was excited,\" said Ms. Sanchez, who made three trips to the buffet for chicken, fish, mashed potatoes and banana pudding.</p><p>At the Cicero Golden Corral, it has taken entrepreneurial efforts by co-owners Linda and Hassan Musaitif to coax customers -- particularly kids -- to not sneak behind the plexiglass walling off the chocolate fountain to dip their fruit into the flowing sweets. The owners hung signs discouraging the act, but some kids reached around the plastic's side to dip in their strawberries regardless, Mr. Musaitif said. The brother and sister duo has since covered up the security gaps by the fountain with sheet pans to discourage dipping. Workers now dip fruit into the molten chocolate for customers. \"The guests are not getting to the chocolate fountains on their own,\" he said.</p><p>The owners said they are focused on cleaning, even getting the carpet cleaned multiple times a week. \"It's immaculate,\" Ms. Musaitif said. Still, the biggest challenge in running the buffet is retaining enough workers, she said. Turnover has been high, as with other restaurants, she said. Customer demand has been strong a month after the grand opening, the owners said. The line starts out into the parking lot a half an hour before opening, and lasts until 8 p.m., she said. Some customers go three to four times a week, particularly those with kids. \"They are getting a lot of value for their buck,\" Ms. Musaitif said. The all-you-can-eat buffet is $10.99 for lunch for adults, and $15.99 for dinner.</p><p>Las Vegas allowed buffets to restart last month, too, though some are now asking customers to make reservations. Bacchanal Buffet, a $74.99-a-head smorgasbord of crab legs, shrimp cocktail and prime rib at Caesars Entertainment Inc.'s namesake casino in Las Vegas, is one of them, taking bookings for the first time since 2012. The company said it introduced a reservation system to limit wait times and reduce the amount of guests in line. It is limiting walk-in customers.</p><p>Diego Lacayo, a 31-year-old electrician in Las Vegas, made a reservation at Bacchanal as soon as he heard it was coming back and had about four plates of bone marrow, lobster bisque and tiramisu. He and other customers spoke at the entrance and in lines about how happy they were to be back, giving each other suggestions on where to find certain dishes. \"I missed the entire buffet experience,\" he said.</p><p>Americans get a taste of indulgence and excess at a flat price through buffets, which began to gain mass popularity in the U.S. in the 1940s in Las Vegas. The El Rancho Vegas introduced a \"Buckaroo Buffet\" to keep gamblers inside its casino by offering unlimited food for one price.</p><p>Golden Corral, which calls itself the nation's largest grill-buffet chain, has made changes -- gloves in nearly all buffet stations and replacement of serving utensils every 20 minutes. The company, based in Raleigh, N.C., cordoned off most of its signature chocolate fountains for the first time in its 48-year history, with workers dipping fruit for customers instead to avoid crowding and improve sanitation. \"The buffet business will never be the same,\" said Chief Executive Officer Lance Trenary.</p><p>Betsy Standage, who lives in Arizona, said she has been hunting for buffets over the past year with her husband. She finally found one she liked in Show Low, Ariz., that had no distancing requirements and allowed customers to serve themselves. When food is served by someone else, she said, it isn't the same. \"You want to take a spoonful of what you want,\" said Ms. Standage.</p><p>Other fans say returning to buffets feels like a reunion. Jeremy Betts, who lives in Trempealeau, Wis., recently went back to a buffet he has been going to for roughly 20 years.</p><p>He was surprised that the quality and variety of food ranging from pepper chicken to lo mein had remained the same as before. \"I had been waiting,\" he said.</p>",
