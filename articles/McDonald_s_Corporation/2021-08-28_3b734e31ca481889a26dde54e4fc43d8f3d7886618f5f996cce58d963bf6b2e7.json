  "text": "<p>One thing was clear: A meme lord now occupied the boardroom.</p><p>Mr. Cohen, who became GameStop 's chairman in June, is one of several company insiders who post outlandish memes or tweets and have cult-like followings in forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets. They include Tesla's Elon Musk and AMC 's Adam Aron , who are now known in the online communities as \"Daddy Elon\" and \"The Silverback.\" Mr. Cohen goes by \"Papa Cohen.\"</p><p>Their social-media strategies are risky but can be effective: GameStop 's share price remains up almost 1,000% for the year. Tesla has a roughly $700 billion market value -- more than five times General Motors Co . and Ford Motor Co . combined. AMC 's stock, meanwhile, is up more than 1,800% thus far in 2021.</p><p>Name: Ryan Cohen / Reddit nickname: \"Papa Cohen\"</p><p>Title: GameStop Corp. chairman</p><p>Mr. Cohen's ice cream-and-frog post wasn't the first or last cryptic tweet from the GameStop investor who now owns roughly 12% of the company's shares. Previously, Mr. Cohen was in charge of pet-supply retailer Chewy Inc ., the company he co-founded, before selling it for more than $3 billion in 2017.</p><p>In the months after he joined GameStop 's board, Mr. Cohen tweeted a photo of a tombstone bearing the words, \"RYAN COHEN R.I.P. DUMB ASS,\" and posted a picture of himself with chopsticks up his nose. It garnered thousands of likes and retweets and inspired countless discussions across the internet -- and created ardent followings in real life.</p><p>His Feb. 24 ice cream-and-frog tweet enthralled amateur traders on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum. One trader guessed that Mr. Cohen had signaled he wanted shares to leap like a frog. Another surmised that Mr. Cohen would fix GameStop just as McDonald's tried to fix its troubled ice cream machines. Others on Reddit predicted the ice cream itself hinted at a big announcement. \"Ryan Cohen 's tweet = Big news coming this Sundae?\" one Reddit user wrote. A spokesman for Mr. Cohen declined to comment.</p><p>Name: Adam Aron / Reddit nickname: \"The Silverback\"</p><p>Title: CEO, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc.</p><p>The boss of the world's largest movie-theater chain is a graduate of Harvard Business School who was well versed in communicating with Wall Street before he got to AMC in 2016. This year he learned how to speak to a new audience: the nonprofessional trader.</p><p>It began when AMC 's stock soared thanks to a push from Reddit users. Mr. Aron started following scores of these investors to see what they were tweeting. He also shared memes that referred to Reddit jokes. In May, he tweeted a meme of his head photoshopped onto promotional material for the movie \"The Godfather,\" though the title was replaced with \"The Apefather,\" an homage to everyday traders who call themselves apes. \"And the hilariously funny memes keep coming,\" he tweeted alongside the picture. He also tweeted a photo of the movie poster for \"Gorillas in the Mist\" with his face replacing Sigourney Weaver's.</p><p>\"They don't want to be interacting with, I think you might say, a dry, boring suit talking corporate speak,\" Mr. Aron said in an interview. Sometimes on Twitter , he said, \"I'm explaining real corporate news that's going on . . . other times we're just laughing and smiling and winking a little bit.\"</p><p>Name: Elon Musk / Reddit nickname: \"Daddy Elon\"</p><p>Title: CEO, Tesla Inc.</p><p>Few have better demonstrated how taking some risk on social media can pay off than Mr. Musk, the billionaire who runs electric-car maker Tesla. He frequently posts nonsensical memes and hurls insults at critics, while his tweets often become market-moving events.</p><p>Yet Mr. Musk's Twitter habit hasn't been without controversy, including a 61-character tweet three years ago: \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.\" Tesla's stock finished up 11% on the day of the news before then falling for 15 of the next 20 trading days. Mr. Musk and Tesla each paid a $20 million fine in a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the tweet, and agreed the company would sign off on any written statements on Twitter by Musk that could be deemed material.</p><p>Securities regulators have since flagged Mr. Musk, who could not be reached for comment, as being in violation of that policy. Still, he keeps tweeting. When Mr. Musk added #bitcoin to his Twitter biography one January morning -- around the same time as a tweet that said \"In retrospect, it was inevitable\" -- the price of bitcoin gained nearly 15% within the first hour after the tweet was sent.</p>",
