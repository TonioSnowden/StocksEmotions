  "title": "European Police Aim to Keep Young Hackers From Slipping Into Cybercrime; Teenagers and children, some as young as 8, can acquire simple skills of criminal hacking, police say. COPS, a Dutch group to steer young people away from cybercrime, is being replicated in Finland, Denmark and elsewhere",
  "text": "<p>Police more often focus on protecting children from online predators. The new programs, however, aim to also shield the digitally gifted young from an undertow of illegal enterprise on the web. Keeping young people from cyber missteps is more efficient and less expensive than the long investigations and surveillance tools needed to catch established hackers, said Floor Jansen, a cybercrime specialist who joined the Dutch national police's renowned High Tech Crime unit in 2012 and who started COPS in 2020. She is now deputy head of the High Tech Crime unit.</p><p>\"If you wait for somebody to develop a complete cybercriminal career, society loses, the police loses, but also the person loses,\" Ms. Jansen said of aspiring cyber delinquents. The COPS program has cost around 150,000 euros, or $151,000, a year, excluding staff salaries, she said.</p><p>One of Ms. Jansen's early projects was modeled on an initiative in the U.K. to identify young people committing their first criminal hacking offense, and give them mentoring and cybersecurity education. Ms. Jansen and her eight-person team communicate regularly with police in other European countries about their work and are organizing a conference in October through Europol, the European police agency, where they will instruct other law enforcement groups on preventing young people from getting into hacking.</p><p>Kids who spend a lot of time on computers can get in over their heads.</p><p>Barbara Gemen, a human resources professional, worried for years about her son's online activities. He started hacking when he was 8, often breaking into Wi-Fi networks at the local McDonald's and other places, she said.</p><p>Ms. Gemen sought advice from her son's school and the police, but didn't get any help, she said. So she started reading his browsing history and looking up terms to understand what he was up to.</p><p>The fork in the road came when people her son met through an online game asked him to hack companies and send them stolen information. The boy got scared—and told her, Ms. Gemen said. She helped him break off contact.</p><p>Now a COPS workshop leader, Ms. Gemen said she wants to help parents understand what isn't OK for their children to do online—like launching denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that take down websites.</p><p>\"They don't know it can be their own son or daughter,\" she said of parents. Now 20, her son is a student and a volunteer with the Dutch police.</p><p>Entry to the cybercriminal underworld can occur quickly, given the right set of circumstances.</p><p>\"An individual can become an international cybercriminal in a week irrespective of their age, if they have the understanding, the experience and the connections,\" said Greg Francis, a former cybercrime investigator for the U.K.'s National Crime Agency who consults with the Dutch COPS program.</p><p>Besides workshops for parents, the COPS staff invite children and teenagers who score high on a digital skills challenge to workshops where they learn about illegal online activity, as well as about lawful career paths in cybersecurity and gaming.</p><p>Research shows that those with an early interest in hacking have strong technical skills and often an interest in gaming, said Julia Davidson, a professor of criminology at the University of East London. She is among the researchers working on a European Union-funded cybercrime survey of around 8,000 young people.</p><p>\"The problem will even grow bigger over time. It's useless if we only make arrests and don't look at other things like disrupting or preventing,\" said Matthijs van Amelsfort, the head of the Dutch police's High Tech Crime unit, which has taken down major cybercrime groups.</p><p>In Finland, suspects identified in 30% of all solved cybercrimes last year were under 18, according to Viivi Lehtinen, project manager of the Cybercrime Exit program at the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation. Suspects in 59% of solved cybercrime cases were under age 30, she said.</p><p>Hacking tools and instructions for knocking out websites are simple to find, Ms. Lehtinen said.</p><p>\"You can commit a crime only by clicking. It's been made so easy. When you think about someone who is 10 years old, how do you prevent that from happening?\" Ms. Lehtinen said.</p><p>Finland plans to start a pilot intervention program targeting young hackers next year, Ms. Lehtinen said.</p><p>The focus on preventing cybercrime, rather than response after the fact, is new for some officers, said Niels Denny Sorensen, leader of the department of digital investigation at the Danish Police.</p><p>In April, the police created an \"online patrol\" to interact with young people on social media, focusing on a range of crimes including sexual abuse and terrorism. The 10-person department is now working with the Danish police's cybercrime investigators to learn about hacking, and plans to start monitoring for cybercrime this year, Mr. Sorensen said.</p><p>With the pandemic came a surge in the amount of time everyone spent online—including children—prompting Portugal's public prosecutor's office to create a guide for those aged 12 to 16 on legal and illegal online behavior, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>In the Netherlands, the COPS team has begun advising other Dutch investigative units on preventive techniques. Last year, the High Tech Crime unit arrested a 24-year-old and a 15-year-old suspected of selling hacking tools through a private Telegram group. They also searched the home of an 18-year-old suspected of being involved.</p><p>The COPS team urged those who made the arrests to enter the Telegram group and inform the other members that their associates were caught, said Wouter Klijnsoon, a COPS intervention specialist.</p><p>That step is key, he said. \"People might feel invincible and anonymous online,\" he said, \"and we try to show you're not.\"</p><p>Write to Catherine Stupp at Catherine.Stupp@wsj.com</p>",
