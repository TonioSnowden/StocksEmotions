  "title": "California Fast Food Wages Would Be Set by Government Under Bill Passed by State Senate; Representatives for chains including McDonald's persuaded Legislature to remove provision holding them liable for labor violations by franchisees",
  "text": "<p>A previous version of the bill passed by the state Assembly in January also allowed the council to oversee workplace conditions such as scheduling and made restaurant chains joint employers of their franchise's employers, potentially opening them to liability for labor violations.</p><p>Representatives for companies including McDonald's Corp., Yum Brands Inc. and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. succeeded in having those provisions removed in negotiations via amendments over the past week, though they still oppose the bill.</p><p>\"This is the biggest lobbying fight that the franchise sector has ever been in,\" said Matthew Haller, president of the International Franchise Association, a trade group whose members own many fast food restaurants.</p><p>A University of California, Riverside School of Business study commissioned by the franchisee association found that setting minimum wages between $22 and $43 would generate a 60% increase in labor costs and raise fast-food prices by about 20%.</p><p>California's current minimum wage is $15 and is set to increase by 50 cents on Jan. 1.</p><p>The state Assembly, which like the Senate is controlled by Democrats, is expected to pass the modified version of the Fast Act before the end of California's legislative session on Wednesday. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom then has 30 days to decide whether to sign or veto the bill.</p><p>Mr. Newsom hasn't taken a public stance on the current version of the bill, but his Department of Finance opposed the original version.</p><p>Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com and Christine Mai-Duc at christine.maiduc@wsj.com</p><p>California Fast Food Wages Would Be Set by Government Under Bill Passed by State Senate</p>",
