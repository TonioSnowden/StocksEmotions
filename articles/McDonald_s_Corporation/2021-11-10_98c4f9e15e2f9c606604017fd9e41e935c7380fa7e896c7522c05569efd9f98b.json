  "text": "<p>The stock market is open on Veterans Day, and most other businesses stay open during the federal holiday, as well.</p><p>And many of them are offering special discounts and perks for veterans this year.</p><p>That includes Krispy Kreme DNUT and Dunkin' dishing free donuts; IHOP and Denny's flipping free pancakes, and StarbucksSBUX pouring free coffee. Nearly all of these deals are for in-store customers only — so online orders are excluded. More Veteran's Day food deals include free entrees from Olive Garden and Applebee's. And all of these deals are for veterans as well as active military members.</p><p>Read more:All she wants for Christmas is a Big Mac?
