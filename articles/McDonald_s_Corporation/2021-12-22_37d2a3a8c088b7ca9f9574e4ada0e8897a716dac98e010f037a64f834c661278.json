  "title": "Technology:  McDonalds  To Sell  Digital  Startup  ----  By Kimberly Chin",
  "text": "<p>   McDonald's Corp. said it would sell to Mastercard Inc. a digital startup that it acquired nearly three years ago in a bid to boost sales at drive-throughs and digital kiosks. </p><p>   Dynamic Yield Ltd., which helps retailers provide personalized digital promotions to consumers using streams of customer data, has operated as a stand-alone company within the chain since its acquisition. For McDonald's, it provides personalized offers for customers of its stores. It also works with other retailers to boost online sales. </p><p>   McDonald's said it would continue to work with Dynamic Yield and Mastercard to bring the technology to additional markets. McDonald's has worked with Mastercard on several of the fast-food chain's digital initiatives, it said. </p><p>   The companies declined to disclose the terms. </p><p>   McDonald's installed the Dynamic Yield suggestive-selling technology across thousands of drive-throughs and kiosks in the U.S., U.K., Australia and Canada, with the technology suggesting additional menu items for customers to buy upon placing their order. </p><p>   Franchisees have questioned the system's performance in the past year. McDonald's has said that a review of transactions found that Dynamic Yield's technology had contributed to sales less than originally reported. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Heather Haddon contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
