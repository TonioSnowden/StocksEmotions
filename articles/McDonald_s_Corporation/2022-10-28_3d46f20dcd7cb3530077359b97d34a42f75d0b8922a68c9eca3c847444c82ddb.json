  "title": "McDonald's Is Cool Again --- Savvy marketing pushes chain past headwinds",
  "text": "<p>Analysts knew that business was relatively strong at the burger chain, but it still blew past their expectations for the third quarter. Comparable sales rose by 9.5% globally from the same period a year earlier and 6.1% in the U.S., despite economic headwinds. Systemwide sales rose by 2%, and by 9% in constant-currency terms. More than 60% of McDonald's revenue is international -- among the highest of American fast-food chains -- and it was forced to sell its large Russia business this year.</p><p>The golden arches tend to shine in bad times, though, and this was no exception. For example, U.S. customer traffic to fast-food chains was very weak in August, according to Placer.ai data cited by Credit Suisse, falling by 6.9% from a year earlier. McDonald's logged a 3.1% traffic increase, though. It is seen as relatively good value in its category and is especially strong in breakfast, which is now doing far better than lunch and dinner as old commuting habits return to prepandemic patterns.</p><p>But part of the answer is savvy marketing and a solid digital strategy, and those bode well for the future. One-third of systemwide sales in major markets are now digital, and the U.S. app has 25 million active customers.</p><p>CEO Chris Kempczinski cited \"culturally relevant marketing campaigns\" worldwide during Thursday's investor call. The chain's U.S. Camp McDonald's promo through its app, a \"virtual camp experience featuring the hottest lineup of food deals, menu hacks, limited-edition merch and music performances from amazing artists,\" was a hit over the summer. And, though it came just after the end of the quarter, so were its adult Happy Meals, featuring collectible figurines. U.S. foot traffic rose by a whopping 37.1% year over year the week of Oct. 3, when they were introduced, according to Placer.ai, compared with average traffic growth of 4.3% over the preceding four weeks.</p><p>Another savvy marketing stunt was revived just recently is the McRib sandwich that the chain has hinted might be on its farewell tour. \"Enjoy our famous pork sandwich as if it's your last!\" Like nostalgia, fear of missing out is a tried-and-true tactic.</p><p>Of course, times could get a lot worse with economists lifting the estimated odds of a recession in the U.S. and especially in Europe. The continent's energy crisis might require targeted aid from the parent company to franchisees socked with surging power bills. With very high European exposure compared with peers, that could get expensive.</p><p>Generally, though, McDonald's has been a safe port in global economic storms. During the recession surrounding the financial crisis, for example, its stock had a total return of 2.15% compared with a 4.4% drop for an S&amp;P 500 subindex of restaurants and a 35% loss for the S&amp;P 500. McDonald's also outperformed the broad market during the 2001 recession, but not as soundly.</p><p>With the stock trading at 25 times prospective earnings, according to FactSet consensus -- the same multiple as its broader industry group -- investors don't need to overpay for a proven performer that clearly has its mojo back.</p>",
