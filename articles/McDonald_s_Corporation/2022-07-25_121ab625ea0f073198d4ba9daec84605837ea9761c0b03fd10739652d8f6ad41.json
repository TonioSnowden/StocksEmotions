  "text": "<p>Walmart Inc. warned that higher prices for food and fuel are causing consumers to pull back, hurting the retail giant's profits for the current quarter and fiscal year.</p><p>The company, which warned in May that it was stuck with too much unsold goods, said it was having to cut prices to reduce merchandise levels at its flagship chain and Sam's Club warehouse chain, which would crimp its profits.</p><p>The announcement sent Walmart's shares down more than 8% in after-hours trading Monday. It opened a week when a raft of global brands and multinational companies—from McDonald's Corp. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. to Visa Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.—are slated to update investors on their latest quarterly results and the outlook for the rest of the year.</p><p>Inflation has been running near the highest levels in decades and the Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates this week as it seeks to fight higher prices. Several high-tech companies have warned in recent days of slowing growth, and leaders of some of the biggest banking companies have cautioned they see a high risk of recession.</p><p>Walmart said higher prices for food and fuel have hurt sales of general merchandise, especially apparel, which generate higher profit margins for the company. Overall, the company expects comparable store sales, excluding fuel, for its Walmart U.S. division to rise 6% in the second quarter from a year ago, but the growth is coming from less profitable items. The company is slated to give its full second-quarter report Aug. 16.</p><p>(More to Come)</p><p>Write to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com</p><p>Walmart Cuts Profit Outlook as It Lowers Prices to Move Goods</p>",
