  "text": "<p>After reading your Lex note (“McDonald's/fried chicken: pecking order push”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f942fa2c-4ddb-4e4c-974a-227b97eb18f5\">Lex</a>, March 31) we think there are other facts that readers need to know. </p> <p>The column asserts that McDonald's is struggling to post growth. But during investor updates we've shared that we've been refranchising. Specifically, we've gone from 81 per cent franchised to 93 per cent franchised between 2014 and 2018. </p> <p>Cumulative sales across franchised and company-owned restaurants grew $12bn from 2014 to 2019, with 2019 sales exceeding $100bn. </p> <p>As a result, during this period McDonald's increased operating income from $1bn to $9bn, operating margin efficiency from 29 per cent to 43 per cent, free cash flow and average restaurant cash flows were at or near record highs in most major markets in 2019. </p> <p>Lex goes on to assert that 2020 was a performance failure for McDonald's. But in the fourth quarter, McDonald's delivered its strongest quarter of the year, recovering nearly 99 per cent of fourth quarter 2019 global comparable sales (and dare I remind readers, there was not a global pandemic in the fourth quarter of 2019). </p> <p><strong>Michael Gonda</strong> <br><em>Chief Communications Officer, McDonald's <br>Chicago, IL, US</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: McDonald's puts its finances on the menu' FT.com 7 April.
