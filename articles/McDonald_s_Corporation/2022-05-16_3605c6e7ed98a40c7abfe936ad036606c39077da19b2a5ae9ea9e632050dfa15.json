  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>Could Covid be the undoing of the Chinese economic miracle? Figures released today show that lockdowns to enable President Xi Jinping's zero-Covid strategy are enacting a significant toll on economic activity.</p> <p>Industrial production, the motor that drove China out of the initial Covid shock in early 2020, dropped 2.9 per cent in April. This ran counter to expectations of a slight increase.</p> <p>Meanwhile, retail sales, the country's main gauge of consumer activity, slumped 11.1 per cent year on year, compared with forecasts of a 6.6 per cent fall from economists polled by Bloomberg.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10010084.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Today's data are a stark reminder of the economic damage being done by China's zero tolerance approach to coronavirus, enacted through citywide lockdowns, mass testing and quarantine centres. Xi has reaffirmed his commitment to the policy as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69ac0449-c6f9-4b30-a346-bd6716e735e5\">the tool to eradicate Covid</a> ahead of his bid for a third term in power later this year, but it is expected to have deep ramifications, not just for China but for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9318db50-e0c3-4a27-9230-55ff59bcc46e\">global supply chains</a>.</p> <p>The immediate future looks equally difficult for the world's second-largest economy and its neighbours. The benchmark coal price for the Asian market was pushed to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/970dd075-c4c9-44e1-93ee-029dc2bee716#post-a2100412-c3b8-412b-8c31-9dbfabb830b4\">record high</a> today because of weak supplies from Australia.</p> <p>High-energy coal shipped from the Australian port of Newcastle was assessed at almost $400 a tonne by Argus, a price reporting agency. That topped the previous high set in March after the invasion of Ukraine raised gas prices, pushing power stations to burn coal to generate electricity instead.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Sweden formally <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/970dd075-c4c9-44e1-93ee-029dc2bee716#post-ac49a5d5-cc4a-468d-b41f-e59bbafd630a\">announces Nato application</a></p></li>  <li><p>Lloyd Blankfein warns of ‘<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce305e83-fd33-4ed2-9662-8e04764d83a2\">very, very high risk</a>' of US recession</p></li>  <li><p>Boris Johnson calls for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0672dec7-ef91-410a-9da6-aa93e9d635ae\">‘sensible' solution</a> to Northern Ireland trade dispute</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/970dd075-c4c9-44e1-93ee-029dc2bee716\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>The economic gloom has spread to the EU. Today, Brussels <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf9794ee-6b0d-4a50-a433-91cd76fab7a0\">cut its growth forecasts further</a> and lifted its inflation outlook, blaming the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>Both the EU and euro area are set to expand by 2.7 per cent this year, significantly lower than the previous forecast of 4 per cent. Inflation is now expected to surpass 6 per cent, with some central and eastern European countries likely to see double-digit price rises in 2022.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>British manufacturers are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8127dbfd-a464-4ee5-9581-ff1edb22e20c\">bringing production back to the UK</a>, reversing the “offshoring” trend of recent years because of concerns about how the pandemic and Brexit have disrupted supply chains. Three-quarters of companies have increased the number of their British suppliers in the past two years, according to a survey by Make UK, the manufacturers' trade group.</p> <p>A key part of the problem for Europe in its effort to wean itself off Russian oil and gas is the existence of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd4aeffe-d243-49c7-9f4e-152ee54a4f26\">infrastructure “pinch points”</a> across the continent. Jonathan Stern, research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said many projects being reconsidered have been planned for years but rejected as not commercially viable when assessed against cheap Russian gas supplies. That assessment has now changed.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p>G7 foreign ministers have warned of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d76bbe5-1163-473b-82cf-c327f3672134\">global hunger crisis</a> unless Russia lifts its Ukraine blockade. Speaking at the conclusion of a three-day meeting in Germany on Saturday, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said some 25mn tonnes of grain were stuck in Ukrainian ports that were being blockaded by Russian forces — “grain that the world urgently needs”.</p> <p>Inflation has returned to haunt Brazilians, triggered by the surge in global food and fuel costs. At 12 per cent, it is now at an almost two-decade high and officials are increasingly concerned that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/999cdb06-d068-4fd0-9892-1781101d59d3\">price pressures are becoming entrenched</a> across the economy.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p>America's <strong>shale oil companies</strong> are enjoying a cash bonanza, following months of capital restraint by a sector that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84e228a9-9e97-4445-9527-2b7ed80283a7\">suddenly finds itself in demand</a> thanks to the global energy crisis. Operators will generate about $180bn of free cash flow — operating income minus capital and maintenance outflows — this year at current crude prices, according to research company Rystad Energy.</p> <p><strong>McDonald's</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21a9a482-3a87-42b4-8c70-81b3a25bbcea\">announced</a> that the invasion of Ukraine means it can no longer run outlets in Russia. The Chicago-based company, which operated 850 restaurants in Russia and employed 62,000 people, is looking for a Russian buyer that would retain these staff. It said it expected to book a non-cash charge of $1.2bn to $1.4bn for the exit.</p> <p><strong>Renault</strong> has sold its Russian business Avtovaz, which made the Lada, to a state-backed car institute <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/515d978a-16c9-4af9-a8b8-4c5abdfd1ee7\">for two roubles</a>. The French company's exit highlights the meagre options facing businesses trying to leave Russia without huge losses on their investments.</p> <p><strong>Ryanair</strong> chief executive Michael O'Leary has warned that the outlook for flying remained fragile and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fd4a355-3665-4b56-a14f-712a6bf9d503\">vulnerable to new shocks</a>, as the carrier reported a loss of €355mn for the 12 months to the end of March, down from €1.015bn the year before. O'Leary added the airline would “do very well” over the summer if travel was not disrupted by a new coronavirus variant or the war in Ukraine spreading.</p> <p>City centre <strong>shopping malls</strong> may at last be evolving into multipurpose hubs for business and leisure as well as shopping, as envisaged by their 20th century creator, Vienna-born architect Victor Gruen. But reinvigorating older centres will require investment, a challenge in a cash-strapped sector that has suffered from brutal value destruction, according to an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f024fd8-ade5-4468-9cb0-0a73d2a66364\">FT analysis of the property sector</a>.</p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p>Anger about high bonus payments for executives, often paid on top of hefty salaries, is easy to understand. But now studies have found that the whole system of paying people to hit targets is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f397fb4-da63-4ccd-bac1-343828540bf2\">flawed</a>. This is in large part because a lot of bonus systems are outdated in an age of knowledge work, writes FT columnist Pilita Clark.</p> <p>Male managers in the UK are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/022eecef-940f-453c-aaa9-eeabec83aa28\">blocking efforts</a> to improve the gender balance at British companies, according to research by the Chartered Management Institute. Two-thirds of the male respondents in the survey of 1,149 managers said they believed their organisation could successfully manage future challenges without gender-balanced leadership. The survey follows <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b12e7173-f9bb-42cd-9dfc-8b9e44a4cf33\">widespread condemnation of sexist remarks</a> directed at <strong>Aviva</strong> chief executive Amanda Blanc at the company's AGM last week.</p> <p>Packing up a workspace is a huge task, but one Oxford scientist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1364c955-e9f9-46c1-80e5-3114e6beabd3\">did just that</a> and moved his team to the Netherlands, in part to be closer to his family after 14 years of working in the UK and partly to avoid the adverse consequences of Brexit for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5dc0dda-b9d2-4ec1-bce4-cf3d0693a4ff\">British science</a>.</p> <p><em>Get the latest worldwide picture with our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker/\"><em>vaccine tracker</em></a></p> <h1>And finally . . . </h1> <p>The FT has a new columnist, critical communications strategist Rutherford Hall. He kicks off this week by offering some (rather suspect) advice to London-based Russian businessman (don't on any account say oligarch) Oleg on why <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5da587b-6b25-4c13-9e96-0b0cd1f75405\">building a new swimming pool</a> in the upstairs of his South Kensington mansion might not be the best way to improve his image.
