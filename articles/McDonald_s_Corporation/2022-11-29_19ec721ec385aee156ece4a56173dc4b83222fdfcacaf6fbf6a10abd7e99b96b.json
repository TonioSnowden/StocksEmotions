  "title": "In 'Glass Onion,' an Art Collection That Says 'Rich Jerk'; When great art is supposed to signal bad taste, you hang the Rothkos upside down. The 'Knives Out' sequel's creative minds on inventing a sight-gag $1 billion collection.",
  "text": "<p>Art abounds in the new movie which opened in theaters last week and hits Netflix Dec. 23. In the film, entrepreneur Miles Bron, played by Edward Norton, has a collection featuring the most expensive artworks in the world. His private island includes what the audience is told is a Banksy-designed dock that emerges from the sea when boats arrive. One of his friends compares his not-so-humble abode, which includes a menagerie of glass sculptures teetering precariously in the living room, to the Tate Modern.</p><p>And, yes, he has the actual Mona Lisa on display. He explains to his loathsome fellow \"disrupter\" chums that it's on loan from the Louvre, which is shut down for the pandemic. (The movie takes place in May 2020.)</p><p>Miles's art is more than just set decoration. In director Rian Johnson's twisty whodunnit—a sequel to 2019's \"Knives Out,\" once again featuring Daniel Craig's suave Southern detective Benoit Blanc—everyone in this ostensible paradise is a potential murderer. What Miles chooses to hang on his walls is a window into his psychological profile. Look closely and you may be able to decipher just what kind of man he is.</p><p>\"He has a lot of actually amazing masterpieces in his home, but it was important that the context those masterpieces were set in indicated that he thought of them mostly as possessions,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"I think a lack of self awareness is the biggest signpost for Miles in all things, and his taste in art had to definitely reflect that.\"</p><p>Creating an ostentatious fake art collection for one of the fake richest men in the world fell largely to production designer Rick Heinrichs, a frequent collaborator of Tim Burton. Much of the art in the film are replicas of real paintings. Other works are originals created by Mr. Heinrichs and his crew.</p><p>To begin assembling Miles's collection Mr. Heinrichs and Mr. Johnson looked at a list of the most expensive known private artwork sales in history. They also added some personal favorites such as Hockney's \"Nichols Canyon,\" of which Mr. Johnson had a print in his bathroom during high school.</p><p>There is no cohesive theme. \"For all of us, it had to be just the wrong side of gauche and bad taste,\" set decorator Elli Griff said.</p><p>Miles's taste—or lack thereof—is largely, according to Mr. Heinrichs, guided by two principles. The first is money. He buys what other people tell him is worthwhile to own because he can. The second: perceived coolness.</p><p>\"He wants to be seen as a cool bro, he wants people to be impressed by his alt sensibilities, his disrupter status,\" Mr. Heinrichs added.</p><p>To that end, Mr. Heinrichs created some originals that echo the likes of subversive artists such as Banksy. For example, Mr. Heinrichs made a plaster cast of a giant baby's head, blindfolded it and hung it so it appeared to be crying gold tears.</p><p>Similarly, hidden among Miles's collection of glass sculptures is a torso made up of balloons—a nod to Jeff Koons. \"I was thinking of Jeff Koons as a sort of prototypical bad-boy artist,\" Mr. Heinrichs said. \"Of course, Miles is attracted to that. Probably doesn't even really get it, but he knows he's cool because he's got it.\"</p><p>The glass figures were initially created using a mix of real and faux glass. But the production's prop warehouse burned down, destroying the sculptures that were already in the process of being made. Mr. Heinrichs relocated efforts to a glass factory outside Prague, which brought his designs to life.</p><p>For paintings, Mr. Heinrichs and assistant set decorator Sonja Nenadic enlisted artisans on location in Serbia to create exact recreations of art the filmmakers licensed for use. Among them, Jean-Michel Basquiat's \"In This Case\" featuring a skull figure against a red backdrop, which sold for $93.1 million in 2021.</p><p>\"They were really observing pigment thicknesses and color,\" Mr. Heinrichs said.</p><p>James Gemmill, a scenic artist and veteran of films including \"Paddington\" and \"The Da Vinci Code,\" was responsible for the \"Mona Lisa.\" Mr. Heinrichs said even the back of da Vinci's portrait had to look accurate because on screen it was housed in a glass case. \"I wasn't sure if you were going to see it,\" he said—he wanted to make sure he was covered if someone did.</p><p>Though the action is happening largely in front of the artworks, the gallery walls are full of gags for the viewer. A version of a real Francis Bacon crucifixion image hangs nearby portraits of Ronald McDonald in the style of Francis Bacon. In Miles's Grecian-inspired dining area, there's a mosaic featuring Kanye West in ancient garb. \"It's subtle, but it's there,\" Mr. Johnson said of Mr. West's likeness. Miles also, of course, has an enormous shirtless portrait of himself hanging in his den.</p><p>When Mr. Johnson saw the Rothko, titled \"Number 207 (Red over Dark Blue on Dark Gray),\" hanging above Miles's sitting area, he asked if the abstract painting was hung correctly. Mr. Heinrichs said it was. Johnson wanted him to flip it. \"The Rothko is actually upside down,\" Johnson said. \"I love the idea that Miles has no idea.\"</p><p>Even if the art is designed to make fun of Miles, Mr. Johnson said he and the cast members were impressed by the creations that surrounded them. \"Edward would walk around the set like he was shopping,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"Like, 'I'll take this and this.'\"</p><p>He couldn't, Mr. Johnson said: \"For all those ones that are actual works of art we have to destroy them at the end of the shoot.\"</p><p>More in film</p><p>* The Thanksgiving Movie Your Family Will Actually Agree On</p><p>* How Will Ferrell Became the King of Christmas</p><p>* Now in a Theater Near You: Cannibalism, Vomit and Severed Fingers</p><p>* Candace Cameron Bure Wants to Put Christianity Back in Christmas Movies</p><p>* How 'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' Fans Plan to Mourn Chadwick Boseman at the Movies</p><p>In 'Glass Onion,' an Art Collection That Says 'Rich Jerk'</p>",
