  "text": "<p>   LONDON -- Matthew Payne turned on the BBC last Sunday for commentary on the St. Leger Stakes horse race, the final leg of the English Triple Crown. </p><p>   Instead, he got a two-hour update on the whereabouts of Queen Elizabeth II's coffin in Scotland from the news-and-sports radio station. </p><p>   \"They're forcing it down your throat,\" said the 55-year-old from outside London. He said he respects the queen, but \"it's literally suffocating. It's too much.\" He noted the queen was a horse-racing fan herself: \"I don't think she would have wanted this.\" </p><p>   Britain is nearing the end of a week-plus mourning period for the late queen, the country's longest-ruling monarch, whose 70 years on the throne won her widespread popularity. Her death, at age 96, set off long-planned ceremonies and events across Scotland, where she died, and the British capital, London.The country's TV channels have scrapped regular programming to broadcast live updates, often via helicopter, of the movement of the queen's coffin. There have been processions and vigils. </p><p>   Some Brits are starting to grumble it's overkill. A survey of nearly 3,000 people in Britain conducted Tuesday by pollster YouGov said that 49% of people thought there was too much coverage of the queen's death, while 41% said it was about right. A few folks, 2%, said there wasn't enough. </p><p>   The queen's death has triggered an outpouring of emotion. Hundreds of thousands have turned out for nationwide events. A line to pay final respects as she lies in state in London has snaked more than 4 miles. Complaints largely don't reflect disenchantment with the queen or the royal family, but the disruption some of the pomp and circumstance has caused. </p><p>   A state funeral is planned for Monday, which the government declared a public holiday. The funeral has led to the cancellation or delay of hospital procedures, soccer matches, industry conferences, medical exams -- and other people's funerals. Schools and grocery stores will be shut on Monday. McDonald's won't open until 5 p.m. that day. </p><p>   Matches from soccer's Premier League to the lowest professional tiers of the sport were postponed. That upset Adam O'Grady-Marshall, who had bought $85 train tickets to see his hometown team, Peterborough United, play last weekend. </p><p>   \"Madness,\" said Mr. O'Grady-Marshall, a 39-year-old graphic designer in northern England. He and friends traveled anyway to the empty stadium to browse the team store. \"Epic amounts of money have gone down the drain for businesses and customers,\" he said. </p><p>   The funeral has also rearranged vacations. Ian Holland planned to head from Liverpool to London to watch ABBA Voyage, a concert in which the Swedish band is represented by holograms. The Monday show was canceled, but with train tickets and a hotel already booked, he and friends will travel anyway. </p><p>   \"I'm sure we'll find a pub and play darts or something,\" the 36-year-old chef said. \"But the whole royalty thing isn't for me, so we'll just go keep out of trouble and have a little trip while one of the wildest and most expensive funerals on taxpayer money happens.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Michael Wright contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
