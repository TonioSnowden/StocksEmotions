  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  \"You know what the funniest thing is . . . it's the little differences.\" </p><p>\n  Like a Royale with Cheese, Vincent Vega, the \"Pulp Fiction\" character played by John Travolta, might find Vkusno &amp; tochka's \"fish burger\" a slightly off version of the more familiar Filet-O-Fish. But the company that replaced McDonald's in Russia, sans Big Macs and Coca-Cola due to Western boycotts over its invasion of Ukraine, is only the latest in a long line of chains mimicking the golden arches. </p><p>\n  Some exist in the few places McDonald's hasn't planted its flag such as North Korea's Samtaesong (three big stars). A company specializing in tours of the hermit kingdom chose its words carefully when commenting on the quality of the burger chain: \"Well, it is fair to say that Samtaesong probably wouldn't last long in a competitive and mature fast-food market. . . .\" </p><p>\n  Israel's MacDavid, which opened in the late 1970s, wasn't legally kosher according to the U.S. chain, which sued it for trademark infringement. It quickly dropped its Big Mac and has shriveled to a single outlet in Haifa since McDonald's arrived years later. Less is known about the fate of Kazakhstan's McDoner, which existed before McDonald's roared into the former Soviet republic. </p><p>\n  Try as they might, the pattern has been the near extinction of local imitators once the American original arrives, but there is always hope. As MacDavid's owner David Magen defiantly told United Press International when facing down the fast-food giant in court: \"Did they invent the hamburger?\" </p><p></p>",
