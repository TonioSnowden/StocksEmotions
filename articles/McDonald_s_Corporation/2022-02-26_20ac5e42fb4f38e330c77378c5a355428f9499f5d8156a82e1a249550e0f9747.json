  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Beyond Meat's Supermarket Sales Fall 20%  ----  By Jesse Newman",
  "text": "<p>   Beyond Meat Inc. shares dropped Friday after the plant-based meat alternative maker reported a bigger-than-anticipated quarterly loss and a sharp decline in U.S. grocery sales. </p><p>   The California-based company late Thursday reported an $80.4 million net loss for the three months ended Dec. 31, saying weaker demand for its products in U.S. supermarkets compared to year-earlier levels more than offset higher revenues from the company's international and U.S. food-service business. </p><p>   U.S. grocery sales dropped nearly 20% in the quarter, reflecting what Beyond said was lower demand, fewer shipping days versus the year-earlier period, increased discounts and lost market share. Chief Executive Ethan Brown said the company considers lower grocery sales a temporary disruption to growth, and that it is taking multiple steps to rejuvenate sales, including launching new products and boosting sampling in grocery stores following a slowdown during the pandemic. </p><p>   \"We certainly think the category is going to recover,\" Mr. Brown said on a conference call Thursday. </p><p>   Beyond shares closed down 9.2% Friday, partially recovering from an even steeper drop. </p><p>   Mr. Brown said Beyond also had focused its U.S. innovation on restaurants last year, giving priority to business with fast-food chains and a joint venture with PepsiCo Inc. Earlier this year, Beyond introduced Beyond Fried Chicken in over 4,000 KFC stores, while McDonald's Corp. has expanded its U.S. test of the McPlant burger, developed with Beyond. Whether or not such products win a permanent place on menus will factor into Beyond's performance this year, the company said. </p><p>   Beyond's U.S. food-service sales grew 35% in the quarter, and the company added about 2,000 U.S. food-service outlets to its roster, compared with the prior quarter. </p><p>   Beyond, founded in 2009, uses yellow pea protein, potato starch and other ingredients to make burger patties, sausages and nuggets. </p><p>   Beyond shares peaked above $234 in mid-2019 after the initial public offering at a price of $25 earlier that year. Shares have fallen since then as meat alternative makers have dealt with pandemic-related challenges and uncertainty around the products' growth prospects. Beyond's stock has fallen about 71% in the past 12 months. </p><p></p>",
