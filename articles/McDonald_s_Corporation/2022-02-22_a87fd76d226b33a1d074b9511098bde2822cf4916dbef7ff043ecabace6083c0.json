  "text": "<p>* SoFi Technologies slipped 3.1% ahead of the bell. The lender is buying banking-software maker Technisys for about $1.1 billion, the latest in a string of deals designed to transform it into a one-stop financial shop.</p><p>* Shares of Digital World Acquisition Corp., the blank-check company that is merging with Donald Trump's social-media venture, surged 28%. The platform, Truth Social, has gone live in the U.S., but some would-be users reported being unable to create an account or received error messages when trying to do so. Others were prompted to join a wait list.</p><p>* Results are due from Home Depot and Macy's before the open.</p><p>* Technology stocks were set to lead losses at the open, and major names were slipping. Apple ticked down 1.1% premarket, Tesla slipped 2%, Microsoft fell 1.1%, Alphabet shed 0.8% and Meta Platforms was down 1.6%</p><p>* McDonald's shed 0.9% premarket. Carl Icahn has launched a proxy fight for two board seats at McDonald's, as the activist investor pushes the fast-food chain to require its suppliers to change their treatment of pigs.</p><p>* DraftKings shares dropped 6% premarket. Both Needham and Wells Fargo cut their price targets for the stock.</p><p>* Unisys fell 4.5% off hours. The IT company reported revenue growth of 1.4% in 2021, but a net loss from continuing operations.</p><p>* Palo Alto Networks, Agilent Technologies, Virgin Galactic and Toll Brothers are among the companies reporting earnings after the close.</p><p>Chart of the Day</p><p>* Investors are wagering that the recent pain in the stock and bond markets will intensify. Short sellers are adding to their positions against the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Exchange-Traded Fund Trust, which tracks the broad U.S. stock index, at the fastest rate in nearly a year.</p><p>Write to James Willhite at james.willhite@wsj.com</p><p>DWAC, Virgin Galactic, Exxon Mobil, DraftKings: What to Watch When the Stock Market Opens Today</p>",
