  "text": "<p>Vladimir Putin and Joe Biden have accepted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22996c27-4882-4297-a845-228857bc382e\">“the principle” of a summit</a> to ease tensions over Ukraine, the White House and French presidency said, capping a series of increasingly urgent diplomatic efforts led by Emmanuel Macron to defuse the crisis.</p> <p>The possibility of a meeting between the Russian and US presidents follows days of rising fears that Moscow will launch a full invasion of Ukraine. These concerns were heightened over the weekend when Belarus said 30,000 Russian troops participating in joint drills would stay in the country indefinitely.</p> <p>The Kremlin said on Monday that there were “no concrete plans” for such a meeting, but did not rule out the option. “It is too early to speak of any concrete plans to arrange some sort of summit,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. But he added: “A meeting is possible if the heads of state decide it is useful.”</p> <p>Instead, he pointed to a potential meeting between Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, and Sergei Lavrov, Russian foreign minister. “We understand that this week a meeting of Lavrov and his US counterpart is possible. Also, we do not exclude the possibility of ministers of France and Russia,” Peskov said. Putin is due to address a session of Russia's security council on Monday. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>On the ground: </strong>On Ukraine's eastern front lines, an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a2de3d7-0486-4af4-8e45-0afc18b40213\">FT reporter could hear heavy shelling</a> on Ukrainian army positions.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Interview: </strong>Germany's finance minister raised fears that Russia could retaliate against western sanctions by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b23082f5-030d-42df-be8b-3d55ef613b1a\">cutting off gas supplies</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Opinion: </strong>Western officials believe that if Russia attacks, it might use the brutal tactics deployed in Chechnya and Syria.
