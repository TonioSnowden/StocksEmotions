The deep discount marks the 1957 price of the flame-broiled burger traditionally topped with lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, ketchup, pickles and onions, which normally costs around $4 today.</p><p>“In 1957, Burger King changed the game with the introduction of the Whopper sandwich — an iconic, flame-grilled burger prepared your way (with 1,024 potential combinations, to be exact),” Burger King North America head of marketing communications Zahra Nurani wrote in a statement. “And now, 64 years later, we're excited to celebrate our beloved burger by offering The Whopper for its original price of 37 cents exclusively to Royal Perks members.”</p><p>Read more: Tesla's $1,900 ‘Cyberquad' EV for kids sold out, restocked and sold out again</p><p>The throwback deal is only available to Burger King's Royal Perks members, however, and must be ordered online or on BK's app.</p><p>Rival burger chain McDonald's MCD recently ran a similar promotion, dishing Egg McMuffins for just 63 cents (rolled back from its modern-day $3.99 price) in November to mark the breakfast sandwich's 50th birthday.
