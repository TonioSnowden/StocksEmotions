  "text": "<p>Devotees of deep-fried foods say they carry indulgent, therapeutic properties that healthier fare—salads or grilled chicken—can't match.</p><p>Fried chicken \"satisfies the inner self,\" says Libby Friz, a television writer who lives in Los Angeles, making her feel like \"a cat asleep in a sun spot.\"</p><p>In Ellsworth, Wis., known as the state's cheese curd capital, dairy processor Ellsworth Cooperative Creamery can't keep up with orders for the cheesy nuggets, which are often deep-fried, says Chief Executive Paul Bauer. The creamery's cheese-curd business grew 38% in 2021 and sales in the first two months of this year are up another 24%, Mr. Bauer says, as grocery orders soar for its Cajun and hickory bacon-flavored curds, and more restaurants add Ellsworth's beer-battered variety to their menus. Companies that specialize in battering, breading and seasoning are having a field day with curds, he says. </p><p>A basket of fried cheese curds PHOTO: Angela Owens/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>\"Those guys are going like gangbusters,\" says Mr. Bauer. \"The market has changed to comfort food.\"</p><p>While the health risks of fried food are plentiful, nutritionists say there can be an upside: Consuming greasy morsels and meals can reduce the effects of stress on the bodyand can even help people produce more serotonin, which can lessen feelings of depression.</p><p>Whether it's fried eggs or deep-fried Oreos, Kansas native Spencer Mustoe agrees. \"Generally, if you start your day with hearty comfort food, you know that it's either about to become a great day or you're already well into a great day,\" says Mr. Mustoe, who works for a startup software company.</p><p>The number of fried foods on restaurant menus in the U.S. rose 5% in the first three quarters of last year, according to market-research service Mintel Menu Insights. Demand for fried-chicken sandwiches has sparked an arms race among restaurateurs, with at least 10 major U.S. fast-food chains including McDonald's Corp., Shake Shack Inc. and Jack in the Box Inc. introducing the sandwiches during the pandemic.</p><p>Lamb Weston Holdings Inc., a key supplier of french fries to fast-food chains, says America's \"fry attachment rate\" has increased. The measure, which refers to the rate at which consumers add french fries to their orders, rose to 24% of orders from 22% before the pandemic. </p><p>Would you like waffle fries with that? PHOTO: Angela Owens/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Lamb Weston executives said recently that even rising prices aren't lessening consumers' appetites for their fries. \"What's the elasticity of a french fry?\" says Tom Werner, Lamb Weston's CEO. \"Right now, we haven't seen it.\"</p><p>Those orders are giving the nation's deep fryers a workout and putting wear and tear on the equipment. From March 2020 through the end of 2021, repair calls for deep fryers at restaurants rose 93% due to higher utilization, says Daniel Estrada, CEO of 86 Repairs, which coordinates repair services for restaurants.</p><p>The deep-fried surge isn't boosting business everywhere. WW International Inc., formerly known as Weight Watchers, is lamenting that fewer consumers want to diet. Online searches for diet programs this January were down 20% from a year ago, which is a big blow to its business, the company said on an earnings call March 1.</p><p>\"Traffic and search right now continues to be under pressure,\" says Mindy Grossman, WW's outgoing CEO at the time. \"That's the industry-wide trend.\"</p><p>Certified nutritionist Vanessa Spiller says the pandemic was a difficult time for many people, with normal routines disrupted and boundaries between work and home blurred. \"People go to nostalgic foods to feel better,\" she says. \"We are definitely coming out of the pandemic less healthy.\" </p><p>Fried chicken wings with bbq sauce PHOTO: Angela Owens/The Wall Street Journal</p><p>Tyler Singletary, a technology startup executive who lives in Brooklyn, says his go-to is chicken-fried steak. The thin slice of beef, which is breaded, fried and smothered in Southern-style white gravy, makes him nostalgic for what his mother used to cook. \"She just called it cube steak,\" he says.</p><p>Health-conscious consumers are looking for ways to indulge their fried-food cravings at home, too. Air fryers,countertop convection ovens that make food taste fried by circulating hot hair at high speeds, were among the most popular holiday gifts of 2021.</p><p>People are using the appliances to fry everything from cauliflower to entire pork tenderloins, without the hot oil of a deep fryer, says Bob Nolan, head of demand science at Conagra Brands Inc. More than 40% of U.S. consumers own air fryers, according to Mintel.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Did the pandemic change the amount of fried food you consume? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"Air fryers have exploded in popularity,\" Mr. Nolan says. \"People are looking for crispy, restaurant-quality food. But a big, giant thing of grease is not appealing to millennials.\"</p><p>Some fryers have been exploding literally. In November, an air fryer blew up when a student at Michigan State University placed it on an electric burner and accidentally turned on the burner, according to local news reports.</p><p>Wanda Yee, who lives across the U.S.-Canada border in Vancouver, British Columbia, says her air fryer regularly sets off her fire alarm. But that hasn't stopped her. A few weeks ago, Ms. Yee relocated the appliance outdoors to continue frying her spring rolls, waffle fries, chicken wings and almost everything else she cooks.</p><p>\"Our air fryer has been working perfectly once we moved it to our patio,\" she says.</p><p>Write to Annie Gasparro at annie.gasparro@wsj.com and Jesse Newman at jesse.newman@wsj.com</p><p>Demand for Comfort Food Greases Market for All Things Fried</p>",
