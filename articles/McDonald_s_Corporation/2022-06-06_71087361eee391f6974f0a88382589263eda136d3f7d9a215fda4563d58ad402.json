  "text": "<p>\"They can do a lot more in Fiji,\" said Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, Fiji's attorney general, from his office overlooking a stretch of tropical ocean. \"It's not only about having McDonald's in Fiji.\"</p><p>The Pacific, with its key shipping lanes, fisheries and strategic position, has emerged as a hot spot in the great power rivalry between the U.S. and China. And nowhere has diplomacy been as intense as in Fiji, a nation of nearly a million people and whose capital, Suva, has been called the New York of the Pacific.</p><p>The visit by Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China, who fist-bumped Fijian officials as he strode down a red carpet at an airport near Suva, capped a flurry of recent diplomatic activity. In February, Fiji hosted U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the first visit by a sitting secretary of state in nearly 40 years. Kurt Campbell, the National Security Council's coordinator for the Indo-Pacific, visited in April, and days before Mr. Wang's visit, Australia's new foreign minister, Penny Wong, arrived.</p><p>The jet-setting shows that the U.S. and its allies know they need to strengthen their relationships with Pacific countries, whose friendships have been based on a shared but increasingly distant history of fighting together in World War II.</p><p>\"I will acknowledge, for the U.S. to increase its game, we need to do a better job at increasing our bilateral engagement,\" said Tony Greubel, the charge d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Fiji and currently the top diplomat in the country.</p><p>What's not clear is if those efforts can blunt China's campaign for closer ties in the region, which is raising concerns that Beijing could eventually establish a military presence in strategically important islands near U.S. territory. China has denied it intends to set up a military base.</p><p>\"We see China everywhere,\" said Netani Rika, a former editor of the Fiji Times, one of the country's main media outlets, pointing out that an unfinished, Chinese-financed skyscraper in Suva is hard to miss. \"That is a symbol of China's visibility.\"</p><p>Chinese officials have said their overtures aren't a threat to any nation and are aimed at helping fellow developing countries grow their economies.</p><p>The U.S. was involved with building infrastructure during the war, and many Pacific airports began as airstrips for military use. China, however, has pushed hard in recent decades to enhance its standing, filling a gap in infrastructure financing and deepening relationships with Pacific leaders, some political observers said.</p><p>Washington has always been committed to the Pacific, according to U.S. officials, though it has become more of a focus recently.</p><p>In February, Mr. Blinken released an Indo-Pacific strategy that called for more diplomatic and security resources to be allocated to the Pacific. The Biden administration has also built alliances to counter China's influence, including an economic platform called the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. In one diplomatic victory for the U.S., Fiji was the first Pacific island nation to join the group.</p><p>Mr. Greubel said the U.S. will be adding staff at the embassy -- which serves five countries, including Fiji -- and is looking at opening embassies in some countries where it currently doesn't have a diplomatic presence. He said more staff will be arriving for the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID, which will intensify work to help Pacific countries deal with climate change and could expand to areas such as economic development, education and healthcare.</p><p>Mr. Greubel said the U.S. already contributes to multilateral institutions that provide aid and financing to Pacific nations; offers equipment and training opportunities to Fiji's military, which is active in United Nations peacekeeping missions; supports people-to-people exchanges; and helped to provide vaccines and other public-health support during the pandemic. Looking ahead, he said, Washington could provide more opportunities for people in the Pacific to study or train in the U.S.</p><p>\"We have a brand,\" said Mr. Greubel, noting that many of Fiji's tourist hotels are American chains and that the U.S. is Fiji's biggest export market. \"We have a lot of soft power.\"</p><p>One problem with the U.S. strategy of offering financing through multilateral forums is that when a project gets funding, it is unclear that it is U.S. money, said people involved with international development in the region.</p><p>U.S. standing was also hurt when the Trump administration quit the Paris climate accord, making it appear the U.S. wasn't serious about climate change, which many in the Pacific consider an existential threat, the people said.</p><p>Although Mr. Wang, China's foreign minister, didn't secure a wide-ranging regional agreement at a summit with Pacific leaders in Fiji, China still signed bilateral economic agreements with some nations during his recent tour of the region. That includes Kiribati, which in 2019 switched diplomatic ties to Beijing from Taipei.</p><p>In Fiji, where Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama faces an election within months, some of his rivals said they worry about China's influence. Sitiveni Rabuka, seen as Mr. Bainimarama's main opponent, said he would bring Fiji closer to its traditional Western allies.</p><p>Many people here remain partial to the U.S. Jay Colati, a 29-year-old bartender in Suva, said he favors the U.S. over China given Fiji's shared history with Western nations. But he said the U.S. should be more visible in the Pacific.</p><p>\"All we see is the Chinese flag all over,\" he said.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
