  "text": "<p>US companies will have two months to implement the Biden administration's new Covid-19 “vaccine or test” mandate or face fines as high as $130,000, officials have announced.</p> <p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) said on Thursday it would begin enforcing the new rules, which will apply to any company with 100 employees or more, from January 4.</p> <p>Joe Biden said in September he would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9eb2e1f-965f-462c-bfcd-ca4339cb5ca9\">introduce</a> the mandate as coronavirus infection rates climbed and vaccination rates slowed. The US president said it would help protect workers from Covid, although Republican governors have fiercely opposed it, threatening to sue the administration.</p> <p>“Higher vaccination rates protect our workers, reduce hospitalisations and deaths,” said one senior US administration official. “This is good for workers and, importantly, this is good for the economy.”</p> <p>While the January deadline means employers will not have to implement the mandates before Christmas, it could prove difficult for retailers in particular, whose busiest time comes in late December and early January. They had sought a 90-day implementation period for the mandate. </p> <p>David French, senior vice-president for government relations at the National Retail Federation, a trade group, said: “The Biden administration has chosen to declare an ‘emergency' and impose burdensome new requirements on retailers during the crucial holiday shopping season.”</p> <p>The rules will force companies with at least 100 employees either to make sure staff are fully vaccinated or take a test every week. All federal departments and agencies, government contractors and healthcare providers that received money from government-run insurance schemes would have to enforce a stricter vaccine mandate — without an option to get tested weekly in lieu of getting a jab — for their employees.</p> <p>Employees will not necessarily have to present proof of their vaccination status and will be allowed to sign a statement saying they are vaccinated and that they understand there could be criminal penalties for lying.</p> <p>Employees who refuse to get vaccinated will have to get tested on a weekly basis with something other than an at-home test. Osha is not forcing companies to pay for those tests, but many states do.</p> <p>They will also have to wear masks and maintain their distance from each other in the workplace.</p> <p>Devjani Mishra, an employment lawyer at Littler Mendelson, said: “A lot of employers will struggle with the cost and administrative burden of making employees carry out tests. It is an alternative to a vaccine mandate, but not a very appealing one.”</p> <p>For private companies, the mandate will be enforced by Osha, which will investigate a company if an employee complains it is not complying with the mandate, as well as carrying out limited spot checks.</p> <p>Osha will have the power to fine businesses $13,653 for each minor violation, and as much as $136,532 if the violation is deemed “wilful”.</p> <p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will be able to enforce its own penalties against healthcare companies that fail to comply. If those providers continue to refuse to implement the rules, they will face the prospect of being cut off the government health insurance programmes altogether.</p> <p>Biden came into office on a pledge to bring the Covid pandemic under control. But after a promising start to the year, when the country's rapid vaccine rollout helped to bring down infection rates and deaths, the virus began to spread rapidly once more, fuelled by the rise of the Delta variant and the slowing vaccination rate. Although the case rate is lower than its summer peak, the US is still averaging almost 70,000 new cases daily. </p> <p>Since the president's announcement in September, many large companies have <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/here-are-companies-mandating-vaccines-all-or-some-employees-n1275808\">announced strict vaccine mandates</a>, including Delta Air Lines, Goldman Sachs and McDonald's. </p> <p>Republicans and some employee groups reacted angrily to the new rule however. Richard Burr, the most senior Republican on the Senate health committee, said on Thursday: “I did not believe that federal government mandates will solve our problem. We're seeing cops and firefighters quit, pilots engaged in sick outs, the nation's military contractors worry about our preparedness — personnel are fired over these mandates.”</p> <p>Republican governors in states such as Texas and Florida have threatened to thwart the Osha rule by challenging it in court and introducing their own prohibitions on vaccine mandates.</p> <p>But Biden administration officials said their rules would supersede any state laws, and that they had the legal power to do so because the pandemic was a national emergency.</p> <p>One senior official said: “A virus that had killed more than 745,000 Americans, with more than 70,000 new cases per day currently, is clearly a health hazard that poses a grave danger to workers.”</p><p>Source: Kiran Stacey in Washington 2021 'US companies given two months to implement Covid vaccine mandate' FT.com 4 November.
