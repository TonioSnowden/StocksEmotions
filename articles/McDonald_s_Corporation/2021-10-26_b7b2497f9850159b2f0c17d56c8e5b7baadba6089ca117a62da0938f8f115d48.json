  "title": "Mastercard Introduces Accessible Card Design for Blind Users; The new Touch Card will use distinct notches to help distinguish between a debit, credit or prepaid card",
  "text": "<p>Some banks and other card issuers already offer designs with a notch on the side and other features. Barclays PLC provides a notched debit card, for example, with a bright stripe and arrow to indicate which way to insert the card.</p><p>Mastercard wanted to expand on existing designs without overcomplicating them, said Raja Rajamannar, the company's chief marketing and communications officer.</p><p>\"If you are partly impaired, or totally impaired, you don't need to learn a lot,\" Mr. Rajamannar said. \"All you need to see is OK, there are different shapes.\"</p><p>Features meant to make products accessible to a wider range of consumers have been rolling out across sectors. The Bank of England in March said it would make its £50 note textured so it is distinguishable by feel, McDonald's Corp. is upgrading its self-service kiosks to make them more accessible by the end of the year, and companies such as International Business Machines Corp. and Wix.com Ltd. offer tools to help developers scan their websites for accessibility problems.</p><p>Mastercard worked with the Royal National Institute of Blind People in the U.K. and the nonprofit Visions/Services for the Blind and Visually Impaired in the U.S. to discover pain points in existing cards, according to the company. It forwent using Braille on its new cards, called Touch Cards, because its research found that many people who are blind don't use it, Mastercard said.</p><p>Its new designs are available for other card companies to use as well.</p><p>The designs could boost security for people with vision problems by alleviating the need to ask strangers for help identifying which card to use, said Virginia Jacko, who is blind and president and chief executive of Miami Lighthouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired Inc., a training center for people who are blind or have vision impairment.</p><p>Many people who are blind already have their own methods to differentiate between cards, such as cutting off a piece of one or adding a sticker, said Samuel Proulx, who is blind and works as an accessibility evangelist at Fable Tech Labs Inc., an accessibility-testing platform. The notch designs align well with these methods, he said.</p><p>Notched designs might also end up becoming helpful to people without vision problems, similar to the way that ramps to the sidewalk from the street have benefited not only people in wheelchairs but people with strollers, suitcases and delivery carts, Mr. Proulx added.</p><p>Write to Ann-Marie Alcántara at ann-marie.alcantara@wsj.com</p><p>Mastercard Introduces Accessible Card Design for Blind Users</p>",
