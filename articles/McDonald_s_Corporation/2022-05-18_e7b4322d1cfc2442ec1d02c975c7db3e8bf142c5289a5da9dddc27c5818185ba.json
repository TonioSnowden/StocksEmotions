  "text": "<p>For-Up-to-the-Minute News from Tuesday's Primaries, See WSJ's Live Blog</p><p>The results in North Carolina showed both the power and limits to former President Donald Trump's ability to shape his party's future. His endorsement gave Mr. Budd a boost, but couldn't save Mr. Cawthorn after a series of missteps that had cost the 26-year-old freshman support from a range of voters and local GOP leaders.</p><p>Mr. Trump's influence was being tested in several other Republican primaries on Tuesday. In Pennsylvania, his favored candidate for governor, state Sen. Doug Mastriano, won the party nomination to replace Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, who is term-limited.</p><p>Mr. Trump's endorsed Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, was in a neck-and-neck contest in partial vote tallies with David McCormick, the former chief executive of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund.</p><p>Pennsylvania and North Carolina will be battlegrounds in November for control of the Senate, where each party now holds 50 seats and Democrats run the chamber because Vice President Kamala Harris can break ties.</p><p>Mr. Fetterman's victory over Rep. Conor Lamb, called by the Associated Press, came on a day when he also underwent a procedure to implant a pacemaker with a defibrillator. His campaign said that the surgery, which came after Mr. Fetterman was hospitalized for a stroke Friday, was successful and that Mr. Fetterman was recovering well.</p><p>The Pennsylvania Senate race likely offers Democrats their best opportunity to pick up a seat now held by a Republican, as the current officeholder, Sen. Pat Toomey, is the only Republican senator retiring in a state that President Biden carried in 2020.</p><p>Rep. Budd's victory in North Carolina, which was called by the Associated Press, showed that Republican voters have remained loyal to Mr. Trump. His closest opponent, former Gov. Pat McCrory, had pursued a conservative course when he led the state, signing tax cuts into law and backing a \"bathroom bill'' that restricted access for transgender people and drew protests, including from business leaders.</p><p>Mr. Budd will face Democrat Cheri Beasley, AP said, a former chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court, who would be the third Black woman senator in history and the first Black senator from North Carolina.</p><p>Analysts predict that the race will be competitive, but give Mr. Budd an edge in the November contest to replace Republican Sen. Richard Burr, who is retiring.</p><p>In Western North Carolina, the Associated Press said, Mr. Cawthorn lost to Chuck Edwards, a state senator whose business experience includes owning McDonald's franchises.</p><p>In other highlights of Tuesday's primary elections, House races in Oregon and Pennsylvania will test the power of the Democratic Party's liberal wing to overtake centrist candidates.</p><p>Idaho's Republican governor is defending his seat against a challenge from the state's Trump-backed lieutenant governor. In Kentucky, incumbent Republicans Sen. Rand Paul and Rep. Thomas Massie were renominated. The two iconoclasts have at times halted or voted against efforts to speed support to Ukraine in its defense against Russian invasion, arguing that the measures risk escalating the war or wasting U.S. tax dollars.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What will the primaries reveal to you in advance of the midterms in November? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Many states also have competitive contests for state legislative seats, mayor's offices and other posts. In Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, the state's attorney general, was unopposed for the Democratic nomination for governor. He will face Mr. Mastriano, a leading figure in pushing the state to review Mr. Biden's victory in the state's 2020 vote count over Mr. Trump.</p><p>On Tuesday, the most prominent test Mr. Trump's ability to shape the Republican Party's future is the Senate race in Pennsylvania, where the former president waded into a GOP primary that had seemed to narrow into a contest between Messrs. Oz and McCormick, both wealthy candidates who have built résumés stocked with professional success.</p><p>Mr. McCormick had been ahead in most publicly available polls until Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Oz, star of the recently ended \"The Dr. Oz Show'' on television. Mr. Oz took the lead in many polls after the endorsement.</p><p>The two candidates and their allies ran millions of dollars in negative television ads, and, in tarnishing each other, risked creating a lane for a third candidate to rise. Late polls suggested that this was happening, as Kathy Barnette, a conservative commentator, made a late surge in public opinion polls. But partial vote totals suggested that Ms. Barnette's apparent surge had faded, as she trailed substantially behind the two front-runners.</p><p>In the former steel town of Aliquippa, Pa., retired nanny Nancy Pienkosky, 78, said she voted for Mr. Oz in the Senate race and Mr. Mastriano in the gubernatorial primary. \"I'm voting for whoever Trump says,\" said Ms. Pienkosky, who said she had been a registered Democrat before switching parties to support Mr. Trump in 2016.</p><p>Andy Dlinn, 69, a financial adviser in Pittsburgh, said he had been impressed by Mr. McCormick's record and decided to vote for him. He said he was puzzled by Mr. Trump's endorsement of Mr. Oz in that race.</p><p>\"I'm a big Trump supporter,\" said Mr. Dlinn. \"But I'm not sure what's going on there. I know a lot about Oz, and he's not a conservative.\"</p><p>Mr. Trump has endorsed dozens of candidates this year in addition to Mr. Oz. In early 2021, he gave a \"complete and total'' endorsement to Mr. Cawthorn.</p><p>The freshman has since made a series of headline-grabbing missteps, such as twice having a gun confiscated at an airport, and has said that House colleagues had used drugs and invited him to an orgy, assertions that House GOP leadership denounced as untrue.</p><p>Mr. Cawthorn dismissed the criticism as attacks from the political left, but several local groups and political leaders endorsed his leading opponent in the eight-candidate primary field. Mr. Trump on Monday said he still supported Mr. Cawthorn, saying in a social-media post that the candidate had made \"foolish mistakes'' but deserved a second chance.</p><p>In Idaho, Republican Gov. Brad Little is seeking a second term, but Mr. Trump has endorsed his challenger, the current lieutenant governor, Janice McGeachin, who has called herself an early supporter of Mr. Trump's first presidential campaign and practiced a controversial style of politics, twice issuing executive orders to loosen Covid-19 regulations while Mr. Little was out of the state. Both orders were later reversed. Ms. McGeachin has also called for audits of the 2020 election results in all 50 states, despite Mr. Trump's lopsided, 30-percentage-point win in Idaho.</p><p>Democratic voters in several races have a choice between candidates aligned with the party's centrist wing and liberal wing.</p><p>Mr. Fetterman, who is 52 years old, said over the weekend that doctors informed him that he didn't suffer cognitive damage from his stroke and that he was \"on my way to a full recovery.\" His campaign said Monday that he wouldn't attend a Tuesday night party to watch the voting results. </p><p>Oregon Democratic Rep. Kurt Schrader, a centrist, faces a primary challenge from a progressive. PHOTO: Celeste Noche for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>In Oregon, Rep. Kurt Schrader, a member of the centrist group known as Blue Dog Democrats, is running for an eighth term. His challenger, Jamie McLeod-Skinner, is running to his political left.</p><p>Mr. Schrader has drawn protests from his party's liberal wing for several actions in the current Congress, including his vote in committee against a measure allowing the government to negotiate the price of prescription drugs. Critics said Mr. Schrader was too close to the pharmaceutical industry. Mr. Schrader said that provision, which was part of the Democrats' package of spending on social programs and efforts to reduce climate change, would die in the Senate, and he proposed an alternative.</p><p>Mr. Biden, in a rare endorsement, is backing Mr. Schrader, while several county Democratic groups in the district have endorsed Ms. McLeod-Skinner.</p><p>In western Pennsylvania, state Rep. Summer Lee has been endorsed by the liberal group Justice Democrats in her bid for an open seat in the Pittsburgh area, as well as by Sen. Bernie Sanders and members of the \"squad'' of progressives in Congress, such as Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.</p><p>Her leading opponent, Steve Irwin, a lawyer who led the Pennsylvania Securities Commission, is backed by a number of longtime Democratic officeholders, among them Rep. Mike Doyle, who holds the seat now, and Rich Fitzgerald, the county executive of Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh.</p><p>Ms. Lee backs the Green New Deal, Medicare for All and other elements of the progressive agenda. Mr. Irwin would lower the age of eligibility for Medicare, a position identified with centrists in the party.</p><p>Eliza Collins, John McCormick and Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Aaron Zitner at aaron.zitner@wsj.com and Kris Maher at kris.maher@wsj.com</p><p>John Fetterman Wins Democratic Senate Primary in Pennsylvania; Trump-Backed Candidates in Focus Nationwide</p>",
