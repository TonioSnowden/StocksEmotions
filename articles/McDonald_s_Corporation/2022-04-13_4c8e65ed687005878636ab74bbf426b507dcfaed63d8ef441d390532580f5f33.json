  "title": "Gum-Banning Singapore Now Has a Sticker Problem; The famously spotless country gave out stickers to the vaccinated, and now they're everywhere",
  "text": "<p>Outside, scores of discarded badges ended up stuck to railings, walls, signs, traffic-light posts—practically any surface within arm's reach, even plants. Some of the rules were eased recently, but the unwanted pandemic souvenirs remain.</p><p>Beyond the visual blight, the stickers leave behind a gummy, hard-to-clean residue. All this in a country that famously banned chewing gum three decades ago to keep public spaces spick-and-span.</p><p>The habit's rapid spread, even in a litter-conscious locale, reflects humanity's susceptibility to the \"imitation effect,\" said Tan Ern Ser, a sociology professor at the National University of Singapore. He explained that without formal rules, people tend to copy others. \"Once someone starts the ball rolling…and with no repercussions, then 'sticking all over the place' becomes the norm,\" he said. </p><p>Even plants are stuck with discarded stickers.

It became the norm in 2020 for entry to government medical centers, which allowed entry only after visitors completed a health declaration.</p><p>The housekeeping team at Singapore General Hospital has spent an inordinate amount of time scraping the stickers from elevator buttons, signs and pathways to nearby subway and bus stops. In response, the hospital put up more than two dozen large boards near exits and along pathways that asked people to leave their used stickers there. The boards included large, bolded messages such as \"KEEP FIGHTING\" and \"THANK YOU.\"</p><p>Lee Peishi, the hospital's senior manager of environmental services, said cleaning crews still race to remove errant stickers \"so that others don't follow suit,\" echoing Prof. Tan's copycat observation.</p><p>To many, pasting stickers doesn't count as littering because they aren't tossed to the ground, said Denise Dillon, who teaches environmental psychology at James Cook University in Singapore. \"If you need to bin your sticker, but there's no bin around, you're likely to just stick it on something else,\" said Ms. Dillon, who acknowledged doing it herself.</p><p>Singapore last year imposed laws that allowed only fully vaccinated people and those with exemptions to dine in restaurants and open-air food outlets. The rules extended to malls and libraries. Millions of stickers were handed out, and they quickly started showing up throughout the city landscape, drawing broad complaint. </p><p>A bus stop in Singapore has boards to collect used stickers.

Some ended up on the ground and stuck to people's shoes.</p><p>In response, the mall's marketing team put up an art installation made up of 2- and 3-foot tall eggs for people to decorate. The eggs drew most of the roughly 42,000 stickers handed out over a few weeks, before a rule change last year freed malls from issuing the labels, a Downtown East spokeswoman said. The installation has since been dismantled and the eggs recycled.</p><p>Adeline Tay, a 26-year-old retail saleswoman, said she covered her cellphone case in used stickers when the pandemic entry rules kicked in, and her family used them to decorate plant pots at home.</p><p>After seeing the stickers plastered everywhere, Ms. Tay began filming herself peeling them off, and she posted a video on TikTok, where she has tens of thousands of followers. \"It's what I do on a daily basis,\" Ms. Tay said, \"removing one or two stickers as I go along with my day, with the hope of spreading more awareness.\"</p><p>Earlier this year, Liew Jia Yi, a 32-year-old artist, printed 40 large posters with drawings of pineapples to help publicize a community arts project. A local food center issued yellow and orange stickers to customers, who were encouraged to use the disposable badges to transform Ms. Liew's posters into impromptu collages. Government workers got the ball rolling, pasting on the first stickers. \"Others followed,\" she said. \"It was a bit like a social experiment.\"</p><p>Last month, the Singapore government announced that restaurants and other food outlets wouldn't have to check every diner, but hospitals and clinics must continue with the system.</p><p>Castoff stickers proved helpful to Andrew Lim and his friends on a recent weekend evening. Hungry for fast food, they were hunting for a McDonald's restaurant in a busy shopping district when one of the pals spotted a cluster of bright red stickers decorated with golden arches and the words \"I'm fully Vaxed!\"</p><p>They saw others pasted nearby and followed them to the local burger outlet. \"It was basically like Hansel and Gretel mixed with the Hot and Cold game,\" Mr. Lim said. \"Instead of a trail of breadcrumbs, it's stickers.\"</p><p>Gum-Banning Singapore Now Has a Sticker Problem</p>",
