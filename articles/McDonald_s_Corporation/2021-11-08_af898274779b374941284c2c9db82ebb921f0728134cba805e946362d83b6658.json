  "text": "<p>\"p.s. tragic shootings in last week, both at our restaurant yesterday and with Adam Toldeo [sic]. With both, the parents failed those kids which I know is something you can't say. Even harder to fix,\" Mr. Kempczinski wrote in the text, which became public recently.</p><p>All of wokedom came down on the CEO. \"It's clear to us you're the one who has failed here,\" said a group of 12 organizations, including the Service Employees International Union, in an open letter. \"Your text message was ignorant, racist and unacceptable coming from anyone, let alone the CEO of McDonald's.\" The group staged a protest outside the company's headquarters.</p><p>It's a sign of our destructive times that saying in a private text that adults have some responsibility for the fate of their children is unacceptable. A spokesperson for Mayor Lightfoot criticized \"victim shaming.\"</p><p>The Journal reports that Mr. Kempczinski has taped a video to McDonald's employees apologizing for his text and what he describes as his limited worldview.</p><p>The Chicago Sun-Times homicide tracker reports that as of Monday there were 693 murder victims in Chicago so far in 2021, including 57 under the age of 18. Chicago officials fail to stop the carnage and apologize for nothing, while progressives focus on a CEO for a politically incorrect text. And Democrats wonder why Americans are rejecting their woke ideology.</p><p>The Woke Police Hit McDonald's</p>",
