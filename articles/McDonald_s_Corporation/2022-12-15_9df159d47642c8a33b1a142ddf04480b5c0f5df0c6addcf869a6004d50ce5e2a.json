  "text": "<p>\n  [THE BEST THEATER OF 2022] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  It is tempting to cast a wide net in assembling a list of the best theater of the past year, perhaps even to give a gold star to every production that made it to the boards during 12 tumultuous months. Theaters were canceling performances, postponing openings and announcing that cast members were out with Covid-19 on an almost daily basis. Imagine the desolation of ticket-buyers learning that even stars we might imagine soaring above us mortals -- Hugh Jackman, of \"The Music Man\" -- were kept offstage by the virus. </p><p>\n  Actors are obviously not more susceptible than anyone else to infectious diseases, but it would be mighty peculiar if the inhabitants of River City, Iowa, were all disporting themselves gaily onstage wearing N-95 masks. Actors are on the front lines of theater, necessarily unmasked, necessarily in close proximity. So in assembling my list of the most memorable productions of 2022, I kept returning to how many superlative performances I saw -- and at what cost they could have come. </p><p>\n  I'll start with the remarkable return of Lea Michele, whose career lifted off when she starred in \"Spring Awakening.\" I won't go over the details of l'affaire  \"Funny Girl\"; there's no meat left on that bone. What is worth celebrating is the captivating performance Ms. Michele gives in the role of Fanny Brice -- heretofore considered almost untouchable ground. Buoyantly, boisterously funny, affecting as needed, and supercharged with that seasoning we call stardust, Ms. Michele turned a solid but magic-free staging into a white-hot ticket. </p><p>\n  \"Funny Girl\" is laser-focused on its central character, but many of the shows that registered in my pantheon of unforgettable experiences from the past year were ensemble works. Tom Stoppard's \"Leopoldstadt\" -- the best play of the year -- features a cast of more than two-dozen actors, virtually unheard-of for Broadway plays. In Mr. Stoppard's cumulatively devastating work, they portray several generations of a Viennese family in the first half of the 20th century, as the tides of history, and the horrors of the Holocaust, consumed young and old alike. What is remarkable is how convincingly the actors, sometimes with little stage time together, transmit a palpable sense of a family under siege -- loving, fraying, suffering together, but also dying apart. </p><p>\n  Another unforgettable ensemble brings to disturbing life the troubled characters of Bruce Norris's \"Downstate,\" a truly unsettling play. Set in a group home where men convicted of sexual offenses involving minors live, the play doesn't shy away from the grisly details of their crimes; nor does it avoid delving into the moral and ethical questions regarding their virtual banishment from society. Only a writer of Mr. Norris's fearless nature could have pulled off the uncanny feat of making this seemingly repellent material compelling and strangely moving -- aided by a flawless cast, many from Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre Company, where the production began. </p><p>\n  Also first produced at Steppenwolf was Tracy Letts's \"The Minutes,\" which made it to Broadway after a two-year delay. Here an ensemble cast -- led by Mr. Letts himself and the veterans Blair Brown and Austin Pendleton -- met the challenges of a play that depicts the comically tedious details of a city council meeting while underneath boils a macabre mystery about the absence of a council member. Mr. Letts, author of the Pulitzer Prize winner \"August: Osage County,\" combined in this work his taste for the ghoulish and his wry analysis of the serious strangeness of average people. </p><p>\n  Obviously it does not take a stage full of actors to enthrall. \"Cost of Living,\" Martyna Majok's Pulitzer Prize winner, about two disabled people and their caregivers, or would-be caregivers, commendably brought to Broadway by Manhattan Theatre Club, featured just four actors but had the bruising emotional depth of an intimate epic. And sometimes just two will do the trick, as in the case of Samuel D. Hunter's \"A Case for the Existence of God,\" a delicate drama about two men of different backgrounds -- a gay black mortgage broker, played by Kyle Beltran, and a white man, played by Will Brill, in the process of divorcing as he wrestles with financial problems -- who discover a common bond in their beloved young daughters. Another superb two-hander was \"Chester Bailey,\" by Joseph Dougherty, a World War II drama about a psychiatrist treating a young patient whose mind refuses to accept the truth about a horrific accident. That the two actors who played the roles were father and son -- the inestimable Reed Birney and Ephraim Birney -- gave an extra layer of texture to a play already rich in it. </p><p>\n  It was a lackluster year for musicals, but fortune smiled in giving us two chances to bask in the warmth of \"Kimberly Akimbo,\" which played Off Broadway early in the year and moved to Broadway in the fall, with all its ebullient, offbeat appeal intact. Chief among its manifold delights is the radiant performance of Victoria Clark as a teenager afflicted with a terminal disease that causes her to age prematurely. Balancing the vulnerability of a 15-year-old with the maturity that Kimberly's affliction brought with it, Ms. Clark delivers a performance of uncanny naturalness. Her unforgettable turn is complemented by a flawless ensemble, giving bright life to the witty book and lyrics by David Lindsay-Abaire and music perfectly attuned to the show's admixture of the sorrowful and the celebratory by Jeanine Tesori. </p><p>\n  The other musical highlight is an evergreen, if you can forgive the mild pun: a bliss-inducing staging of Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's \"Into the Woods.\" Productions of this show are all but perennials, but the director, Lear deBessonet, assembled a celestial (if shifting) cast, who brought out all this beloved work's virtues: whimsy balanced by acidic wisdom, a score that continues to dazzle with its variety, and -- in this staging -- the musical's deliciously frenzied roots in farce. </p><p>\n  Concluding, and in a sense capping, a year of unforgettable performances was Audra McDonald's transcendent turn in the Broadway premiere of Adrienne Kennedy's \"Ohio State Murders\" -- the first Broadway production of Ms. Kennedy's long career. (She is 91 years old, and her often surreal, densely lyrical plays have been produced at nonprofit theaters since the 1960s.) </p><p>\n  \"Ohio State Murders\" is a dark and deeply disturbing play, chronicling traumatic events in its protagonist's life, including the loss of a child. But Ms. McDonald's natural incandescence onstage -- and she is onstage for its entire duration -- made it shine with rich meaning. A theatrical year that was continually shadowed by the calamity of Covid thus ended on a luminous note. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  Mr. Isherwood is the Journal's theater critic. </p><p></p>",
