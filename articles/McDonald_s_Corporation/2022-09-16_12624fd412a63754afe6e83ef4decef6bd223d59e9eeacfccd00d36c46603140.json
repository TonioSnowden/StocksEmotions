  "title": "Why McDonald's, Google and other big businesses may have to take responsibility for many more workers; Biden administration's NLRB wants to replace Trump-era regulations that made it easier for companies to avoid responsibility for labor violations and harder for workers to organize",
  "text": "<p>The National Labor Relations Board issued a notice of proposed rule-making earlier this month, saying it aims to provide a clear joint-employer standard that would expand to include companies that don't have direct control over all aspects of an employee's working conditions, \"so long as those forms of control bear on employees' essential terms and conditions of employment.\" The rule could take effect next year.</p><p>The proposed regulations could affect large companies that outsource liability by hiring vendors and subcontractors, or adopting the franchise model by changing the standard by which companies would be considered \"joint employers,\" who deal with direct as well as indirect employees. Workers who are not directly employed by large companies could try to hold those companies accountable for labor violations.</p><p>See also: FTC sends a warning to Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and other 'gig-work' companies</p><p>\"In an economy where employment relationships are increasingly complex, the board must ensure that its legal rules for deciding which employers should engage in collective bargaining serve the goals of the National Labor Relations Act,\" NLRB Chairman Lauren McFerran said in a statement.</p><p>If adopted, the change could affect household names such as McDonald's MCD and 7-Eleven, which use the franchise model, as well as Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG -owned Google, whose workforce includes a large percentage of temps, vendors and contractors both for tech jobs and service positions. In fact, Google's temp and contract workers reportedly outnumber its full-time employees.</p><p>The labor board's proposal comes as efforts to unionize grow, which isn't an accident of timing, according to John Logan, a professor of labor studies at San Francisco State University. \"These campaigns are giving the [labor board] the opportunity to rewrite rules,\" he said, adding that the NLRB can point to instances of labor-law violations and say \"this is why we need this new rule.\"</p><p>Logan also said that if the NLRB changes the rule, he foresees court challenges by big companies.</p><p>For example, \"if there were a large-scale or nationwide union campaign at a franchise restaurant at which there were lots of allegations of unfair labor practices, the board could issue a consolidated cease-and-desist order that would apply nationwide,\" Logan said. That would probably cause a large company to protest and take legal action.</p><p>Meanwhile, there's a unionization drive going on at Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. META that involves mailroom workers who are directly employed by Canon Business Process Services, a vendor hired by Meta. Canon is refusing to recognize the union in that case because the vote ended in a tie, but the Teamsters allege Canon engaged in antiunion activity and that a majority of workers actually signed union-authorization cards.</p><p>See: This obscure band of Facebook workers is in the middle of a union fight</p><p>Logan said it's hard to know whether Meta would be considered a joint employer and have to negotiate with that union under the proposed regulation change. But because Meta is such a high-profile company that has seen a lot of union activity among its service workers, he said the implications are interesting.</p><p>\"This is an area where there has been a lot of labor activism,\" he noted.</p><p>Groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the International Franchise Association are speaking out against the proposed rule change. The rule \"proposes to take away [franchise owners'] independence,\" said Michael Layman, a lobbyist for the IFA, in a statement.</p><p>A policy official at the Chamber of Commerce told The Wall Street Journal that \"contracting as a whole could face legal jeopardy in the context of this rule.\"</p><p>The current joint-employer regulations, which limited the joint-employer standard to companies that directly control workers' conditions, were put in place by former President Donald Trump's labor board and became effective in April 2020.</p><p>The five-member NLRB — currently made up of three Democrats and two Republicans, who issued a dissent against the proposed changes — is inviting public comment through Nov. 7. Responses to those comments are due by Nov. 21. A final rule could take effect early next year, according to labor attorneys who are blogging about the proposed change.</p><p>In-depth: Lyft and Uber tried to change the law.
