  "title": "Diverse Mix of Candidates Compete to Replace U.K.'s Boris Johnson; Unlike the U.S., greater diversity at top ranks in Britain comes from the right, not left",
  "text": "<p>Beyond the numbers lies an interesting twist to British politics that makes it stand out, particularly compared with the U.S. In the U.K., it is the Conservative Party that has long broken new ground when it comes to party leadership, even if its rank-and-file are still predominantly white. The opposition Labour Party, meanwhile, has always been led by white males. It is the opposite of the U.S., where the Democrats have long been more diverse than the Republicans, which have only nominated white males as presidential candidates.</p><p>\"It is a remarkable achievement that this change came from the right,\" says Matthew Goodwin, a politics professor at the University of Kent. He says Labour, like the Democrats, had invested heavily in identity politics.</p><p>Tory Margaret Thatcher was the first female British prime minister. In the 19th century, Conservative Benjamin Disraeli became Britain's first, and so far only, prime minister of Jewish origin. The three last Conservative chancellors of the exchequer have been ethnic minorities. Nadhim Zahawi, the current Treasury chief, who arrived in Britain age 11 after fleeing Iraq, says he was the product of \"the British dream.\"</p><p>Behind this mix of candidates lies one of the Conservative Party's great strengths: its willingness to adapt to win elections, say political analysts and party officials. Officials trace the current mix of candidates back to the early 2000s, when Conservative leaders realized their lawmakers were too male and white to appeal to more liberal voters. Without diversity, its electoral future looked bleak.</p><p>\"Our base is too narrow and so, occasionally, are our sympathies. You know what some people call usâ€”the Nasty Party,\" warned Theresa May, a white woman who would later become Britain's second female prime minister, back in 2002. David Cameron, who took leadership of the party shortly after, began the process to ensure Conservative candidates were put in place that better reflected society at large.</p><p>In the U.K., Tory lawmakers are selected by their district Conservative association. In solidly Conservative districts Mr. Cameron ordered that the short-list of candidates to be lawmaker was more diverse. That meant parachuting highly rated minorities and women into districts that were nearly 99% white, says Rob Ford, professor of political science at the University of Manchester.</p><p>\"The reason he was able to do this was because the predominantly white voters bought the argument,\" says Mr. Ford. \"They knew their party struggled with ethnic minorities and liberal voters.\"</p><p>Nearly two decades later that strategy is bearing fruit. Before the mutiny that ousted Mr. Johnson, seven of his roughly 20 cabinet members were from ethnic minority backgrounds.</p><p>Some analysts say that class is more of a barrier to social attainment than race in Britain, particularly in the Conservative Party, which has long been criticized for stacking its cabinet with graduates from elite universities. Mr. Sunak, for instance, was educated at Winchester College, a private school famed for producing a large number of British political leaders. Others had a steeper hill to climb. Ms. Badenoch worked in McDonald's to put herself through college.</p><p>Mr. Sunak has come under scrutiny over a different issue: his wealth. His wife's father created a successful Indian IT company Infosys Ltd. Mr. Sunak has faced criticism after his wife used a non-domiciled status that allowed her not to pay British tax on her earnings outside the U.K. She has since changed her tax status. Mr. Sunak says he is proud of his father inlaw's business achievements.</p><p>The newfound diversity hasn't affected government policy in any notable way, says Mr. Goodwin. Many in the cabinet, for instance, cheered an increasingly strict immigration policy. Home Secretary Priti Patel, whose Indian parents fled to the U.K. from Uganda, has overseen a plan to permanently send migrants who arrive illegally by boat or truck to the African country of Rwanda.</p><p>Mr. Goodwin argues that policies will matter far more than identity in determining the Tories ability to hold on to working-class voters it acquired during a 2019 election, because British voters \"aren't that bothered\" about race. Mr. Sunak, for instance, was briefly one of Britain's most popular politicians on record after delivering a large pandemic bailout plan when chancellor.</p><p>Halima Begum, the chief executive of Runnymede Trust, a think tank that studies race issues, says she is impressed by the qualities of the ethnic minority candidates but in the end that isn't the important question. \"The ethnicity of our next [prime minister] is in many ways of secondary importance. What matters most is that the nation's next leader does their very best by the country.\"</p><p>While roughly 40% of the U.S. population identify as ethnic minorities, Britain has a far smaller share. About 8% of the British population are Asian-British, from countries like India and Pakistan, while another 3% are Black, mostly from former British colonies like Jamaica.</p><p>Although the race for the top job is more diverse than ever, the British parliament still isn't representative of the country as a whole. There were 65 lawmakers from ethnic minorities elected in 2019, according to parliamentary figures. That number would have to rise to 93 lawmakers to be in line with the British population as a whole. Nor is the Conservative Party particularly diverse. Only a quarter of Tory lawmakers are women. Labour has more women lawmakers and more minorities than the Tories but has so far only had white male leaders.</p><p>Change has been very gradual. The House of Commons had its first Catholic lawmaker in 1832 and the first practicing Jewish lawmaker took his seat in 1858. The first woman to take her seat in parliament was American-born Nancy Astor in 1919. It wasn't until 2002 that a person of ethnic minority background took a seat in a government cabinet.</p><p>When Mr. Sunak moved to rural Yorkshire to act as a Conservative lawmaker back in 2014, he used to joke that his family represented the total immigration to the overwhelmingly white northern English agricultural district. He says he was warmly welcomed to the district where he acquired the nickname \"the maharajah of the Yorkshire Dales\" on account of his large personal wealth.</p><p>In 2019 Mr. Sunak recalled how after his selection as a lawmaker, he invited his grandfather to Parliament. The old man, who moved to the U.K. from India in the 1960s, suddenly stopped in the vast gothic central lobby, took out a phone and called a friend, Mr. Sunak later recalled.</p><p>\"I just want to let you know where I am,\" his grandfather said on the phone.</p><p>Write to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com</p><p>Diverse Mix of Candidates Compete to Replace U.K.'s Boris Johnson</p>",
