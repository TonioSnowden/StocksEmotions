  "text": "<p>The burger, ketchup and soda companies make for an appetizing trio in more ways than one. All three reported results on Wednesday that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. For that, they can largely thank strong customer demand, even in the face of price increases. McDonald's stock rose 2.7% Wednesday, Coca-Cola gained 1.9% and Kraft Heinz was little changed.</p><p>Kraft Heinz said its organic net sales, a closely watched measure that strips out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency movements, rose 1.3% from a year earlier in the third quarter. That is impressive considering the elevated demand in 2020 for food at home. Analysts expected a small decline. Compared with the same period of 2019, organic sales were up 7.6%.</p><p>Unlike in 2020, the rise in organic sales this time was due entirely to price increases rather than underlying volume, which was essentially unchanged from a year earlier. This is positive since it shows the company has the pricing power to pass through inflationary pressures on to consumers. Strikingly, the company's gross margins, while down from last year, are around the same level as before the pandemic at 32%.</p><p>At McDonald's, customers have returned to stores with their wallets wide open: Global comparable sales grew 13% from a year earlier in the quarter and 10% from the same period in 2019. In the U.S., comparable sales were up 15% over two years. That strong performance has continued into October, the company said on a conference call with Wall Street analysts. McDonald's raised prices by 6% to compensate for higher labor and food costs. Customers seem to be taking it in stride. Foot traffic rose from a year earlier, while average check sizes remain high due to higher menu prices and larger orders.</p><p>If not for some lingering impacts of Covid-19, that performance would have been even stronger. Stay-at-home policies in Australia and vaccine mandates for customers in France hampered sales. A tight labor market in the U.S. meant some locations had to dial back late-night hours and couldn't serve customers as quickly as normal.</p><p>The background at Coca-Cola is somewhat different. Organic sales grew 14% from a year earlier in the third quarter, but that was against a sharply lower base: The company's sales were battered in 2020 at out-of-home venues such as stadiums, bars and the like. Still, Coca-Cola said underlying unit volume in the third quarter was ahead of 2019 levels. Pricing was firmer: Price and sales mix contributed 6 percentage points to the 14% rise in organic sales. On a conference call, Chief Executive James Quincey said U.S. consumers seem to be responding better compared with a similar round of price rises \"four or five years ago.\"</p><p>In short, food and beverage is one area where price increases aren't taking away from demand. It rarely pays to bet against the appetite of the American eater.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
