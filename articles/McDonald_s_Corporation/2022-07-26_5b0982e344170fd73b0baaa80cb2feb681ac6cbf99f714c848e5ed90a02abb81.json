  "title": "Coca-Cola and McDonald's Will Be Last to Feel the Squeeze; Consumer staples are fulfilling their traditional role in investor portfolios of providing some resiliency amid a downturn",
  "text": "<p>Less dramatic, but also encouraging, were results from McDonald's, which said global comparable sales increased 9.7%, while U.S. sales were up 3.7%, driven by price increases. Both companies were trading up around 2% Tuesday morning in a weak session for stocks generally.</p><p>When tough times hit, consumers first tend to delay purchases of big-ticket items such as cars or mattresses, Coca-Cola Chief Executive James Quincey said on a call with analysts. As things continue to worsen, they might start to trade down to private-label groceries, but trading down in beverages comes even later when people are really feeling pinched. \"So we tend to have long lead times heading into a recession,\" he said.</p><p>This analysis fits with a statement from Walmart on Monday afternoon, which said that consumers are spending more on groceries and consumables due to inflation, leaving less money for general merchandise.</p><p>At McDonald's, lower-income consumers in the U.S. are trading down to more value items and fewer combination meals, the company's chief financial officer said, but \"high single-digit\" price increases are keeping the chain's top line growing.</p><p>At the same time, Coca-Cola's Mr. Quincey said there has been \"a big, important reprioritization\" within consumer budgets toward things like travel that consumers \"have missed out on over the last couple of years.\" This is especially helpful for Coca-Cola, which gets a large portion of sales from venues such as restaurants, theme parks, stadiums and the like. Away-from-home business, he said, is \"about as good as it's even been.\"</p><p>Consumer staples, in short, are fulfilling their traditional role in investor portfolios of providing some resiliency amid a downturn. But in this unique postpandemic situation, some like Coca-Cola are also offering unusual upside growth. Coca-Cola stock is up around 7% so far this year, compared with a 17% decline in the S&amp;P 500. That is refreshing indeed.</p><p>Write to Aaron Back at aaron.back@wsj.com</p><p>Coca-Cola and McDonald's Will Be Last to Feel the Squeeze</p>",
