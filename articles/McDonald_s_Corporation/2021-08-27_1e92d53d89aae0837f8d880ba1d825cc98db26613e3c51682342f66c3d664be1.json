  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>Britain's summer — such as it was — is barely over but the nation has already begun to fret about Christmas. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe7d9102-569b-4730-9141-1cac70222d2e\">Labour shortages</a> are triggering fears of empty shelves.</p> <p>Fast-food outlets are already buckling. Nando's, where teenagers flock for half a chicken and two sides, had to shut a few dozen stores. “Piemaggedon” looms over <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af306fb2-a356-4c08-a7ff-9b3589b6aae7\">Greggs</a>, a popular purveyor of pasties and cakes. McDonald's is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cac1ad22-26fd-47a3-b871-5e9e973f794d\">scratching milkshakes</a> from British menus. Prosecco has run dry in some pubs. Now Britons face the apocalyptic prospect of Christmas sans mince pies. </p> <p>A shortage of lorry drivers and factory workers is evident in the US and elsewhere too. But Britain's problems are compounded by the estimated 25,000 drivers who left the country after Brexit, a chunk of the overall shortage of 90,000, according to Logistics UK numbers. Long hours in the saddle make this gruelling work for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f832d86-827e-4596-999d-e0618364dbe3\">median hourly pay</a> of £11.80.</p> <p>The market response — pay more — has been more muted than in areas such as professional services. </p> <p>Bottlenecks are cropping up on the ocean too. Freight rates on the China-US west coast route are up 10-fold on pre-pandemic levels. A shortage of spare capacity, always a temporary phenomenon in the gung-ho world of shipbuilding, is twinned with the more permanent need to curb emissions.&#xa0;</p> <p>Maersk is dipping more than a toe in the water with a $1.4bn investment in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c33aeed1-7731-400a-b54f-83916f1ddb23\">carbon-neutral ships</a>. In the absence of industry agreement over fuels, Maersk has plumped for “green” methanol, produced by anaerobic digestion and other means. But production is a challenge, says Lex; ammonia or hydrogen could be better options.</p> <p>Carmakers have been battling a different problem over what makes them go: exploding batteries. General Motors recalled another 73,000 of its Chevy Bolt mass market electric cars and says it will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0663fb58-1e92-4a21-9ab9-46c362cafd12\">seek reimbursement</a> from supplier LG Chem.&#xa0;</p> <p>The latest round of battery replacement will add $1bn to recall expenses of $800m. GM wants LG Chem to pick up most of that. Batteries produce 40 per cent of LG Chem's profits, with electric car power making margins of just 1.4 per cent. The unit offers investors the best hope of strong growth, says Lex, but a mooted listing will now secure a cheaper valuation than had initially been planned.&#xa0;</p> <p>Lithium, cobalt and other minerals being corralled into the transition towards a greener economy are in rich supply in Afghanistan, at least if you believe the hopelessly bullish estimates.</p> <p>Either way, extracting it is a whole different ball game. Many projects fell apart amid political strife, corruption and warfare. Resources will be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dafa5a17-1fff-4f3c-96ff-ec0e951c210e\">no easier to exploit</a> under a new iteration of the Taliban. To political instability, add logistics. Afghanistan is a landlocked region with a threadbare railway network. Miners would need to build their own transport infrastructure. </p> <p>This was a week of topsy-turvy happenings. In the league of fantasy M&amp;A, Lex took a look at what <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/613179f2-0dae-4b53-8cbe-636c858b6684\">J Sainsbury</a> might be worth to a private equity buyer.&#xa0;With Wm Morrison the subject of a bidding war, the UK's number-two supermarket hoved into view.</p> <p>Lex calculates that a leveraged bid for the asset-rich, cash-generative business could generate an annualised return on equity investment of almost 30 per cent over five years. There's a decent land bank and ability to wring out some margin improvement; add in a higher exit multiple and the fantasy buyer bags a healthy return.</p> <p>Profits appeared to be falling into a fantasy land of their own in China. The nominally communist nation is making a show of returning to brass tacks, with equal opportunities and income redistribution.&#xa0;</p> <p>That has put tech companies in a spin, prompting ecommerce platform Pinduoduo to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e4946b5-1e91-4260-b162-3b4028082b4d\">pledge to donate $1.5bn</a> of earnings. While investors drove the share price up by a fifth, Lex cautions foreign investors to increase their risk weighting on Chinese companies.</p> <p>Few corporate entities are more divorced from reality when it comes to numbers than space start-ups. Take Sir Richard Branson's satellite launch start-up Virgin Orbit, now going public via a blank-cheque vehicle in a deal that gives it an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b3d3a6d-0765-4e58-8f33-b051b924bcfb\">enterprise value of $3.2bn</a>. That is more than 213 times this year's expected revenues of $15m or — for those prepared to bank on the future — 2.1 times 2025 forecast revenues.</p> <p>Still, Virgin Orbit's launch technology puts it a cut above the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX. Its system has the potential to send up payloads from runways all over the world. Successful satellite launches have provided proof of concept. As moonshot investments go, Virgin Orbit is one of the better-grounded options. </p> <p>Enjoy your weekend.</p> <p><strong>Louise Lucas</strong><br><em>Lex writer</em> </p><p>Source: Louise Lucas 2021 'Best of Lex: empty shelves and fantasy M&amp;A' FT.com 27 August.
