  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis:  Companies Weigh Risk of Asset Seizures  ---  After Putin backs  nationalization plan,  foreign businesses pull  out or pause operations  ----  By Evan Gershkovich, William Boston and Georgi Kantchev",
  "text": "<p>   Western companies have started to tally the cost of a long-term exit from Russia, after President Vladimir Putin endorsed a plan to nationalize foreign assets after many businesses said they would pause their Russia operations in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. </p><p>   Mr. Putin has backed the plan floated earlier this week by a senior member of his dominant United Russia party. Such a move would help prevent job losses and maintain Russia's ability to produce goods domestically, said Andrei Turchak, the secretary of the general council of the United Russia party. </p><p>   The Russian prosecutor general's office on Friday said it would ensure companies that have said they are pausing or exiting operations comply with the country's labor laws. More than 300 foreign firms have said they are leaving or temporarily suspending work in Russia, according to the Yale School of Management. </p><p>   The planned departures and suspensions have left thousands of workers in limbo. </p><p>   Some Western companies have accounted for the possible long-term loss of assets, detailing or warning of write-downs related to their businesses there. BP PLC, among the first big companies to say it would leave Russia, is relinquishing its nearly 20% stake in Russian oil producer Rosneft. The stake was valued at about $14 billion at year-end; BP said it doesn't expect to recoup any of that. </p><p>   \"We've effectively walked away from our business in Russia,\" said BP nonexecutive director John Sawers at a recent Wall Street Journal event. The value of BP's Rosneft stake is near zero, he said. </p><p>   In most cases, though, companies have kept the door open to an eventual return. Many firms would struggle to keep businesses going inside Russia even if they didn't decide to pause or pull out. Sanctions imposed by the West have hit foreign companies' ability to execute basic tasks, such as bringing in parts, paying employees and getting paid for services done inside the country. </p><p>   McDonald's Corp. said that its move to close its 847 Russian restaurants is temporary, but that it will cost the burger giant roughly $50 million a month from supply chain and other expenses. It said it would continue to pay the 62,000 people the company employs there. </p><p>   Washington warned against a nationalization effort. \"Any lawless decision by Russia to seize the assets of these companies will ultimately result in even more economic pain for Russia\" and may invite legal action, White House press secretary Jen Psaki has tweeted. </p><p>   Nationalization or other such attempts at seizing or expropriating assets would hit companies differently. For some, it could entail a relatively light financial burden -- for instance, losing leases on stores or offices. Harder to assess is the risk of losing intellectual property. New owners installed by the Kremlin may be able to figure out how to make certain products created by foreign companies inside Russia, or continue to use Western brand names in the country. </p><p>   For other companies with operations that include expensive manufacturing equipment or logistics assets, such as warehouses and fleets of trucks, the hit could be heavy. </p><p>   Mercedes-Benz Group AG said the potential risk from an expropriation of assets from its businesses in Russia could be as much as $2.2 billion. </p><p>   Some companies appeared to be moving pre-emptively to signal they are selling out. British American Tobacco PLC said  ownership of its business in Russia is no longer sustainable and it would start to transfer it. The company said it would continue to pay its 2,500 workers and \"do our utmost to safeguard their future employment.\" </p><p></p>",
