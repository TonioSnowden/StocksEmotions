  "title": "Carl Icahn to drop proxy fight over treatment of pregnant pigs at Kroger; Investor says in letter to shareholders he has concluded he was likely to lose the campaign, as he did with McDonald's",
  "text": "<p>He wrote that these campaigns were different from his typical fights given that the two companies are performing well financially, which makes it less likely the campaigns would gain adequate shareholder support. However, he said he doesn't believe their boards are holding their management teams accountable with respect to the treatment of animals or the welfare of their employees.</p><p>At the center of both campaigns were gestation crates used by the companies' pork suppliers to house pregnant pigs. Farmers have said the small crates make breeding more efficient and safer, while Mr. Icahn and his nominees say they are inhumane given that the spaces are so small the pigs can't turn around.</p><p>He has also criticized the pay disparities at Kroger and McDonald's between average workers and executives, saying their compensation policies contribute to lagging productivity. It is an issue he frequently levies at a range of companies.</p><p>An expanded version of this story appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Popular stories from WSJ.com:</p><p>* Ukraine Counterattack Takes Back Parts of Strategic Donbas City</p><p>* Dollar's Climb Stalls Amid Mixed Economic Signals</p><p>* The Altered Lives of America's School-Shooting Survivors</p><p>Carl Icahn to drop proxy fight over treatment of pregnant pigs at Kroger</p>",
