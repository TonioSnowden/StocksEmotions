  "text": "<p>\"They're forcing it down your throat,\" said the 55-year-old from Watford, a town outside London. He said he respects the queen, but \"it's literally suffocating. It's too much.\" He noted the queen was a horse-racing fan herself: \"I don't think she would have wanted this.\"</p><p>Britain is nearing the end of a week-plus mourning period for the late queen, the country's longest-ruling monarch, whose 70 years on the throne won her widespread popularity. Her death, at age 96, set off long-planned ceremonies and events across Scotland, where she died, and the British capital, London. The country's TV channels have scrapped regular programming to broadcast live updates, often via helicopter, of the movement of the queen's coffin. There have been processions and vigils.</p><p>Some Brits are now starting to grumble it's overkill.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Is Britain's response to the queen's death appropriate? Join the conversation below.</p><p>A survey of nearly 3,000 people in Britain conducted Tuesday by pollster YouGov said that 49% of people thought there was too much coverage of the queen's death, while 41% said it was about right. A few folks, 2%, said there wasn't enough.</p><p>The queen's death has triggered an outpouring of grief and emotion. Hundreds of thousands have turned out for various events across the country. A line to pay final respects as she lies in state in London has snaked more than 4 miles long. Complaints largely don't reflect disenchantment with the queen or the royal family, but the disruption some of the pomp and circumstance has caused.</p><p>A state funeral is planned for Monday, which the government declared a public holiday. Combined with the overall mourning period, the funeral has led to the cancellation or delay of hospital procedures, soccer matches, industry conferences, medical examsâ€”and other people's funerals. Schools and grocery stores will be shut on Monday. McDonald's won't open until 5 p.m. that day.</p><p>The queen's death has also temporarily shut down one of Britain's most popular exports, soccer. Matches from the Premier League to the lowest professional tiers of the sport were postponed. That upset Adam O'Grady-Marshall, who had already bought $85 train tickets to see his hometown team, Peterborough United, play last weekend.</p><p>\"Madness,\" said Mr. O'Grady-Marshall, a 39-year-old graphic designer in Leeds, northern England. He and friends traveled anyway to the empty stadium to browse the team store. He didn't end up buying anything. \"Epic amounts of money have gone down the drain for businesses and customers,\" he said.</p><p>The postponements reverberated across the continent. Soccer officials rescheduled Champions League and Europa League matches between British and European teams, prompting disbelief outside the U.K. At a match against Barcelona, fans of German soccer team Bayern Munich held up a banner on Tuesday that said: \"Last minute match delays and bans because of a royal's death?! Respect fans!\"</p><p>The funeral has also rearranged vacations. Ian Holland planned to head from Liverpool to London to watch ABBA Voyage, a concert in which the Swedish band is represented by holograms. The Monday show was canceled, but with train tickets and a hotel already booked, he and friends will travel anyway.</p><p>\"I'm sure we'll find a pub and play darts or something,\" the 36-year-old chef said. \"But the whole royalty thing isn't for me, so we'll just go keep out of trouble and have a little trip while one of the wildest and most expensive funerals on taxpayer money happens.\"</p><p>The government and the palace have long defended the costs of the monarchy, saying it is relatively cheap on a per capita basis. The institution boosts Britain's soft power overseas and sense of unity at home, and it brings in tourist dollars, officials say.</p><p>The recent royal disruptions are also now testing some people's patience.</p><p>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said this past week it would postpone an exam for doctors in training, which had been scheduled for Monday, by four months. A group representing these trainees said such a move was disheartening. \"Delays cause a significant mental toll, as well as potentially affecting training progression,\" it said on Twitter on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for the Royal College said it has been in discussions with the trainees on a better option.</p><p>The Monday holiday also closes down Britain's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, which administers driving tests. That blindsided David Bowler, a 32-year-old project manager in Manchester who had recently turned down a job because he couldn't drive. His appointment for Monday was the earliest one he could book back in May. \"I just don't understand for the life of me why the funeral wasn't on a Sunday,\" he said.</p><p>Jo Rigby said she had no intention of following a Tuesday request from British Cycling, the country's sports governing body, for all cyclists to stay off their bikes during the funeral.</p><p>\"The majority of people who use a bike [use it] as transport, to get to work, travel to meetings, carry heavy shopping,\" Ms. Rigby, a London-based marketing executive, said.</p><p>British Cycling's request was followed by a swift U-turn. The body apologized for its earlier advice, saying instead that cycling clubs should just consider whether it would be appropriate to hold events on Monday.</p><p>Center Parcs, a popular chain of vacation lodges in parks and forests, infuriated some guests by announcing that it would close on Monday. It has asked that guests checking out on Monday leave by 10 a.m., instead of being allowed to use the facilities all day as normal. It also asked anyone due to check in Monday to arrive on Tuesday instead.</p><p>That means Laura Magor, 33 years old, can't cap off a weekend with brunch at the on-site Pancake House to celebrate her birthday, which she shares with both her mom and sister.</p><p>She said her ire was directed not at the monarchy but at Center Parcs, which won't let her cancel the whole weekend but instead offered a 15% discount. She is also concerned that the ambience will be less than celebratory. \"Because there's so many angry people, what's the atmosphere going to be like in this place?\" she said. \"Is it going to be a not very nice weekend?\"</p><p>A spokesman for Center Parcs said the decision was taken \"as a mark of respect and to allow as many of our colleagues as possible to be part of this historic moment.\"</p><p>Michael Wright contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com, Alistair MacDonald at alistair.macdonald@wsj.com and Denise Roland at Denise.Roland@wsj.com</p><p>Ceremonies Around Queen's Death Draw Awe, Respect...and Some Grumbling in the U.K.</p>",
