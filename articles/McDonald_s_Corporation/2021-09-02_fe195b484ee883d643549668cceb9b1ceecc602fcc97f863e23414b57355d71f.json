Users who currently allow their fans to Super Follow them will have a Super Follow badge on their profile.</p><p>According to Twitter, there are four prerequisites that users need to be eligible to set up Super Follows on their accounts — in addition to adhering to Twitter's Super Follows Policy. Those qualifications are:</p><p>Have at least 10,000 followers</p><p>Have tweeted at least 25 times within the last 30 days</p><p>Be based in the U.S.</p><p>Be at least 18 years old</p><p>Adding some sort of subscription service to Twitter is something that has been discussed for years as an opportunity to bring in revenue.</p><p>Twitter&#xa0;has been free to join since it was founded in 2006.</p><p>Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story.</p><p>See also: ‘Now Hiring 14 &amp; 15 year olds': Oregon McDonald's looks to combat labor shortage</p><p>“The first thing we want to focus on is that economic incentive to people who are contributing to Twitter,” Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and the digital payments company Square SQ, said earlier this year. “That can come through a regular subscription, that can come through content unlock, that can come through tipping. There is a host of things and right now we are just studying and prioritizing what those things look like.”</p><p>In February, Twitter announced it was getting into the newsletter business after the company acquired editorial content platform Revue in January.</p><p>Other monetization features Twitter has tried this year are the tip jar, ticketed Spaces and a shopping section.</p><p>Twitter's stock is up 13.93% over the past three months, compared with a 7.9% gain for the S&amp;P 500 SPX over that same period.</p>",
