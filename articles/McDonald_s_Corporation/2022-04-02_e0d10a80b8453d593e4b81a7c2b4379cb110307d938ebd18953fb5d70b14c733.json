  "text": "<p>These returns made it here, inside an Internal Revenue Service building, but the numbers written on them may not reach IRS computer systems for months, leaving taxpayers without refunds or any way to know if their paperwork has even been received. If there is a fire, everything is gone.</p><p>In the long run, the path out of the IRS's catastrophic paper jam is technology that would encourage more e-filing and accelerate the process of turning any remaining paper into electrons. According to the national taxpayer advocate, an in-house critic who calls paper the IRS's kryptonite, the agency is two decades behind states in being able to scan returns that were prepared with software before being printed and mailed. The IRS, citing years of underfunding, says it is working on that and other improvements.</p><p>In the short run, the IRS has diverted modernization funding to find more people -- thousands of them -- who will circle numbers with red pens, stamp documents and manually type data into the system, seven days a week, late into the night, to get the government finally caught up on tax year 2020.</p><p>Yet, the IRS is hiring into a headwind as it competes with private employers for entry-level workers.</p><p>With the unemployment rate again nearing its five-decade prepandemic low, finding all those people poses an extraordinary challenge for the IRS, one the agency is now racing to solve.</p><p>Part of the answer to Ogden's line of tax-return carts is a line of people, 14 miles away in Clearfield. They are jammed into an IRS job fair and spilling onto the sidewalk, drawn by the prospect of stable government jobs that pay at least $15.61 an hour, plus benefits.</p><p>Spencer Donaldson, 33, said he was driven to apply for an IRS job to get away from the stress of his work as a $14-an-hour assistant manager at an understaffed Domino's Pizza Inc. location.</p><p>Compared with Domino's, he said, \"It's not going to be that bad.\"</p><p>The fair is the agency's third in three weeks after the government announced it was hiring 5,000 people at the three main paper-processing centers: here in Ogden; another in Austin, Texas; and one in Kansas City, Mo.</p><p>As of late March, due to the cascading effects of pandemic closures, new tax provisions and staff attrition, the paper backlog topped 9 million individual returns. While about 90% of tax returns are e-filed, that still leaves millions of paper submissions. The IRS still processes those just like it did in the mid-1990s.</p><p>In a typical year, the hallways would swell with paper during the tax-filing season and then empty out. Seasonal workers would get furloughed.</p><p>Now, employees walk past work they can't finish yet, those rolling carts carefully placed inside rectangles of black-and-yellow tape so they don't block the halls. Seasonal workers haven't been furloughed in four years, said Scott Wallace, who runs the Ogden operation.</p><p>Agency officials have said they hope to reach normal levels by the end of the year, and the sooner they can hire people, the sooner they can clear the backlog.</p><p>For these jobs, the IRS's rivals aren't accounting and law firms seeking high-paid professionals. Instead, it is fighting against anyone else trying to find workers in Ogden's hot job market. Unemployment in the metro area was at 2.3% in January, the ninth-lowest among 389 U.S. regions tracked by the Labor Department.</p><p>In Ogden, agency officials say they are competing for workers with Amazon.com Inc., Target Corp., FedEx Corp. and even with tuition benefits offered by McDonald's Corp.</p><p>They have been struggling with attrition rates of 25% to 30% annually. That, says IRS manager Brett Bemenderfer, is driven partly by what happens when you hand a young worker a red pen and instructions on how to circle numbers so someone else can enter them into a computer.</p><p>\"That's not quite their passion that they're looking for,\" said Mr. Bemenderfer, a 23-year agency veteran.</p><p>To compete, IRS officials say they are trying to improve their child-care subsidies, highlight the 10% premium for nighttime work, note the possibilities for advancement, allow flexible schedules and offer $500 referral bonuses to current employees who bring in new ones.</p><p>The job fair was a test of what is known as direct-hire authority, which bypasses normal federal hiring processes.</p><p>Typically, applicants must apply online and wait to be contacted, a process that officials say can take six to eight months and is designed to ensure fair competition for jobs. But people who need the money won't wait for that.</p><p>And the system can be frustrating. Sandra Stradling said she had worked at the IRS 20 years ago and wanted to return but never got any response from the federal government's jobs website.</p><p>\"I thought I was doing everything right,\" she said. \"I kind of gave up.\"</p><p>With the new authority from the Biden administration and Congress, the IRS can send a team of recruiters and its top human-resources executive into Ogden and make tentative job offers on the spot. Workers who then pass background checks on their criminal and tax records can start within 30 to 45 days.</p><p>Ms. Stradling, who lives in Arizona in the winter, got a ride from a relative who was heading north and split the gas money, so she could come to the job fair. She and her nephew, Tyler Mackey, both had job offers by the end of the day.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
