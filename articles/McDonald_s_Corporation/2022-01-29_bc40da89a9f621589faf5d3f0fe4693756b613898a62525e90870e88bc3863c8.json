  "text": "<p>\n  [The trusted advisers of top business leaders] </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  During Mary Dillon's eight-year run as chief executive of Ulta Beauty Inc., its market capitalization nearly tripled to more than $18 billion. Its number of stores doubled. And the beauty-products retailer significantly enlarged its array of luxury brands. </p><p>\n  Her childhood was far from luxurious, however. Her parents -- a steelworker and a homemaker -- raised Ms. Dillon and five siblings in a Chicago bungalow with a single bathroom for much of her early life. She partly paid for her degree from the University of Illinois in Chicago by waitressing at a burger joint, cleaning apartments and tutoring. </p><p>\n  She chose a business major because \"I knew I needed to get a job right out of school,\" she says. \"I didn't even know what an executive was.\" </p><p>\n  Quaker Oats Co. soon picked Ms. Dillon for its brand-management training program. She got her first executive role at Quaker by age 27. PepsiCo Inc. acquired her employer in 2001, and Ms. Dillon eventually advanced to running Pepsi's Quaker Foods division. </p><p>\n  She next led global marketing for McDonald's Corp. </p><p>\n  In 2010, Ms. Dillon made a radical industry shift, accepting the CEO job at U.S. Cellular Corp. She jumped to Ulta Beauty in 2013. Ms. Dillon, now 60, remains its executive chair. </p><p>\n  Here are four of her trusted advisers. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Andy McKenna </p><p>\n  Chairman emeritus of McDonald's Corp. </p><p>\n  Mr. McKenna has known Ms. Dillon since her 2005 arrival at McDonald's, where he then chaired the board. He told Ms. Dillon she should keep her style uncomplicated because \"it's what sets you apart.\" Her honest, straightforward approach \"left no doubt about what she said and meant,\" Mr. McKenna recalls. His comments persuaded Ms. Dillon to deliver an informative but fun speech before thousands of franchisees at a McDonald's 2008 convention. She even refused to use the company-provided speech coach, Ms. Dillon says: \"I did it my own way.\" </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Sol Trujillo </p><p>\n  Chairman of Trujillo Group LLC </p><p>\n  The two met during a Pepsi leadership-development program in 2002. She was a marketing vice president, and he was a Pepsi board member. Mr. Trujillo, a telecom-industry veteran, later encouraged Ms. Dillon to become CEO of U.S. Cellular. \"I watched her first transform the wireless company\" and next, Ulta Beauty, he says. Mr. Trujillo, who chairs the non-profit Latino Donor Collaborative, also broadened her understanding about the power of Latino consumers in the U.S. \"She has taken the [advice] to heart, which has led to market-leading growth for Ulta,\" he says. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Anne Mulcahy </p><p>\n  Former chairwoman and CEO of Xerox Corp. </p><p>\n  The longtime Xerox leader -- and Target Corp. director -- coached Ms. Dillon about effectively expressing her views during board meetings once Ms. Dillon landed her first corporate directorship at Target in 2007. When Ms. Dillon stepped down as Ulta Beauty CEO, Ms. Mulcahy proposed that she be very picky about her future pursuits. This idea \"definitely came from my own learning and mistakes\" following her 2009 retirement from Xerox's helm, Ms. Mulcahy says. While being selective, Ms. Dillon recently joined the board of startup Daily Harvest, a subscription food service. </p><pre>\n </pre><p>\n  Tracee Ellis Ross </p><p>\n  Actress, producer and CEO of Pattern Beauty </p><p>\n  The executives bonded during 2018 talks where Ms. Ross selected Ulta as the first retail partner for Pattern Beauty. Founded by the Black actress, Pattern Beauty offers haircare products to people with curly, coily and tight textured hair. Ms. Dillon chose her as Ulta Beauty's first diversity and inclusion adviser. \"Tracee brings a unique perspective\" in driving greater internal accountability for essential diversity initiatives, she says. Ms. Ross says she counseled Ms. Dillon that increasing diversity often requires \"looking at the spaces where inequity is baked in . . . and hard to see.\" </p><p></p>",
