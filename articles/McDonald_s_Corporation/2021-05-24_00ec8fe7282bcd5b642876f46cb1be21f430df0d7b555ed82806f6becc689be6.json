  "title": "World News:  Navalny  Vies to  Stay in  Public Eye  ----  By Ann M. Simmons",
  "text": "<p>   MOSCOW -- When Alexei Navalny returned to Russia in January after what supporters and Western officials say was an attempt on his life, he knew it was a gamble. </p><p>   Prosecutors had made clear that he would face almost certain imprisonment, potentially sidelining the only opposition leader in years to have rattled Russian President Vladimir Putin. </p><p>   Friends and associates say Mr. Navalny, 44 years old, was acutely aware of how other dissidents had largely fallen from view after leaving Russia and he didn't want to share their fate. Since his return and subsequent detention, his team has instead upped the stakes, releasing charged videos about alleged government corruption and other material online. </p><p>   Mr. Navalny embarked on a hunger strike to demand access to appropriate medical care, a move some observers believe was also intended to ensure he remains in the public eye after he was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in a prison camp. </p><p>   But as Russian authorities work to shut what remains of his movement, the coming months could determine the outcome of Mr. Navalny's standoff with the Kremlin and reveal what, if anything, will succeed him. </p><p>   Russia's most prominent dissident has long used his talents as a showman to galvanize opposition to Mr. Putin's government. During recent court appearances he has quipped about ordering in food from McDonald's and tauntedRussia's leader, calling him a \"naked, thieving king.\" </p><p>   To some of his supporters, he possesses something of a messianic quality. Doctors in Berlin, where he had been flown for treatment after collapsing on a flight from Siberia to Moscow last year, determined he had been exposed to Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve agent. Mr. Navalny, who blames the Kremlin for the attack, was in a coma for weeks. The Kremlin has denied harming Mr. Navalny. </p><p>   He has often posed for photographs with admirers. When some followers lost their jobs after turning out for street protests on his behalf, he wrote a message of thanks last week for his aides to post online. \"Together we will definitely build a country in which no one can be fired for their political views,\" it said. </p><p>   Mr. Navalny is deeply and ruthlessly ambitious, his critics say, and his fixation on being Mr. Putin's sole true challenger means there is no obvious successor. If he is out of sight for a protracted period, his whole movement could falter. </p><p>   \"He doesn't care what views he has -- liberal, fascist, communist, whatever,\" said Sergey Markov, the pro-Kremlin director of the Institute for Political Studies in Moscow. \"This man is a fanatic for power. He is ready to give his life for personal power.\" </p><p>   Other critics labeled Mr. Navalny a stooge of the West after he began publishing bruising critiques of Mr. Putin's Russia. </p><p>   However, Mr. Navalny doubled down on his attacks, helping organize antigovernment protests in 2011 and pivoting to a new foundation aimed at exposing corruption in government circles, telling his supporters that it was time to \"throw off the chains,\" as he put it in a blog post. </p><p>   Mr. Navalny has amassed more than 6.5 million subscribers on YouTube and has used Instagram and Telegram to push his ideas on improving public services and living standards. </p><p>   But it is his videos about corruption that he says is endemic among Russia's elites that made himsuch a significant thorn in the Kremlin's side. </p><p></p>",
