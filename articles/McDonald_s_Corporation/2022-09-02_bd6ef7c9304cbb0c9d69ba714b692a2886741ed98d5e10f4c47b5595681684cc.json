  "text": "<p>\"The business case for diversity is clear, but it's still an elusive concept and can be difficult for companies to manage,\" said former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, now a partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP. Her firm launched a dedicated practice this summer for civil-rights and racial-equity audits, and its clients include Amazon.com Inc. Ms. Lynch, who served in the Obama administration, is leading the review into whether Amazon's employment practices have disparate racial impacts on its hourly workforce.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What effects might race and diversity audits have on big business? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Amazon said its audit has been in development for some time and a nonbinding shareholder proposal, brought by the New York state comptroller, was withdrawn after the company agreed to commission its own review. The company said the decision wasn't in response to pressure from labor groups or unions.</p><p>Some high-profile audits of recent years were in response to negative publicity. Facebook commissioned an audit after criticism of its platform management and workplace culture, while Airbnb Inc. undertook a self-evaluation in response to concerns that both customers and property owners faced discrimination on the vacation-rental platform.</p><p>Starbucks Corp. announced an internal review after a 2018 incident, which sparked protests, in which Black men were wrongly arrested and removed from a Philadelphia store. Starbucks apologized and the company and city reached settlements with the men.</p><p>That audit was conducted by another former U.S. attorney general, Eric Holder, a partner at Covington &amp; Burling LLP who has done similar work for clients such as Uber Technologies Inc. and is currently leading a number of audits, including of Verizon Communications Inc. and of Citigroup Inc.</p><p>Citigroup said its review will examine how it can help close the racial wealth gap, including by providing better access to banking and credit for communities of color. Verizon announced its audit in May, saying it would examine its equity efforts in its workplace and the communities it serves. Starbucks didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The audits might at first glance appear to be a departure from the traditional work of large corporate law firms, but Mr. Holder said the reviews are \"different sides of the same coin.\"</p><p>\"You are defending companies when it comes to these kinds of matters, but on the other side, you are trying to identify weaknesses and strengths to make recommendations for actions that will correct the negative things,\" Mr. Holder said.</p><p>Pressure for racial-equity audits gained steam in the wake of the murder of George Floyd in 2020, prompting shareholders as well as state attorneys general to push for companies to conduct deeper looks at diversity, equity and inclusion.</p><p>This year, there have been 44 shareholder proxy proposals for audits, up from 19 in 2021, according to data provided by the Sustainable Investments Institute, a nonprofit that tracks the issue.</p><p>This year also saw the first majority shareholder votes passing nonbinding proposals calling for audits, including at McDonald's Corp., Johnson &amp; Johnson, Home Depot Inc. and Apple Inc. Others, including Amazon, Verizon and JPMorgan Chase, agreed to audits in the face of requests from investor groups. Microsoft Corp. also recently announced it would conduct an audit.</p><p>The recent push for these audits has expanded beyond analyzing workforce data, pay-equity issues and internal practices to also look at how companies affect their communities, said Brenda Lee, vice chair of the antidiscrimination practice at Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP.</p><p>\"There is pressure coming from all sides,\" Ms. Lee said.</p><p>Wilmer's practice, which was formalized five years ago, features a team of 30 attorneys including Debo Adegbile, who currently serves on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and several former Justice Department lawyers. The firm is handling eight reviews currently and demand is increasing, Ms. Lee said.</p><p>Lawyers say the scope of the audits varies considerably, but they generally involve analyzing a company's policies, interviewing employees and executives, and drawing input from communities affected by the business.</p><p>The size of the legal teams varies as well. Covington, for example, estimated that between eight and 12 lawyers work on an audit at a given time. Clients generally expect the firm to complete the report within 12 months, the firm said.</p><p>While it's still early to see the full impact of audits completed in recent years, some companies already have adopted recommendations and created new programs related to diversity, said Laura Murphy, a business consultant and civil-rights advocate who wrote audit reports on Airbnb and Facebook.</p><p>Uber's board adopted recommendations made by Mr. Holder in 2017, including creating a new reporting system for employee complaints and adopting a rule that requires at least one woman or underrepresented minority candidate to be interviewed for key positions. Airbnb has continued to gather data on how its Black customers experience the platform, and has tweaked its reservation process.</p><p>Uber and Airbnb didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Facebook also updated many of its internal practices, including hiring diversity officers and updating its policies on targeted advertisements. The audit \"better positioned the company to address the ever-changing landscape of civil-rights challenges,\" said Roy Austin, vice president of civil rights at Facebook parent Meta Platforms.</p><p>As racial-equity reviews build in momentum, some of their supporters have expressed concerns that big corporate law firms might have a conflict of interest in defending their clients' reputations.</p><p>\"There is a risk that firms will be doing this to get more billable hours, and not to challenge the status quo at the company,\" Ms. Murphy said.</p><p>Dieter Waizenegger, executive director of SOC Investment Group, which has led shareholder proposals demanding civil-rights audits, said outside law firms are equipped to do the work but need to offer critical feedback and transparency.</p><p>\"We need to be clear,\" he said \"This is not about being a corporate defense effort.\"</p><p>Mr. Holder, who spent six years as attorney general under President Obama, said that a firm's prior relationship with a company might raise questions, but said it's important to make it clear to clients that the investigations aren't intended to cover up shortcomings.</p><p>He recalled telling leaders at one company, \"Here's the deal: We're going to do this audit, and this might be the last work we do for you, because I can assure you that we will be objective and hold nothing back.\"</p><p>\"We continue to do work for that company, even though we released damning results,\" Mr. Holder said.</p><p>Law Firms Jockey to Help Companies Manage Diversity and Equity</p>",
