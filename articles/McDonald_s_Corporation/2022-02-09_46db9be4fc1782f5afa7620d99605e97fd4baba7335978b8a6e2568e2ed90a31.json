  "title": "Business News: Chipotle Raises Its Menu Prices --- Chain looks to fund building of hundreds of stores, many for online ordering",
  "text": "<p>For the company's fourth-quarter ended Dec. 31, Chipotle reported per-share earnings of $5.58, after adjusting for one-time items, exceeding analysts' expectations of $5.25 a share, according to FactSet. The restaurant chain reported net income of $133.5 million, down from $191 million a year earlier.</p><p>The chain's total sales were $2 billion, above expectations.</p><p>The company's shares rose 7% in aftermarket trading Tuesday to $1,556.</p><p>Chipotle's shares had been down more than 16% this year as investors grew concerned about how rising costs were affecting restaurants.</p><p>The Newport Beach, Calif., company said Tuesday that price increases helped boost its sales during the period. It increased prices by 4% in December, with menu prices now up around 10% overall compared with last year, the company said. Chipotle's same-stores sales were up 15.2% for the period compared with last year.</p><p>Chipotle Chief Executive Brian Niccol said that the chain will likely increase prices again this year to offset growing wage and food costs.</p><p>\"I just don't see the inflation, unfortunately, going away anytime soon,\" said Mr. Niccol. He said he has \"chuckled\" about comments made earlier in the pandemic about cost increases being short term: \"It sure doesn't look transitory to me.\"</p><p>Starbucks Corp., McDonald's Corp. and many other chains said they have increased prices as costs have grown and expect inflation to continue to be a concern this year.</p><p>Chipotle raised prices on its meals last year, with the chain saying it was particularly to help cover the cost of wage increases for hourly workers. It has also increased prices on food ordered through food-delivery apps compared with in-store costs.</p><p>Chipotle said that costs grew during the quarter, particularly for beef, freight and avocados. Wages were also up during the period compared with last year.</p><p>The company said Tuesday that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 began to weigh on its sales growth in December and last month.</p><p>Restaurant chains, including Chipotle, have limited hours and seating during the recent coronavirus surge as they have struggled to have sufficient staffing.</p>",
