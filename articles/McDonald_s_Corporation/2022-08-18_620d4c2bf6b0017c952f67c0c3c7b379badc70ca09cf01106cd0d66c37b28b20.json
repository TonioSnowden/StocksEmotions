  "title": "Mark Wahlberg-backed gym chain F45 goes from ab crunches to credit crunch",
  "text": "<p>The workout regime at F45 Training is designed to challenge the body, but also seems to toughen the mind. Every day, tens of thousands of fitness enthusiasts in cities from Anchorage, Alaska, to Johannesburg descend on identically laid-out gyms where, for 45 excruciating minutes, they tackle a circuit of high-intensity exercises that burn calories and build muscle. </p> <p>“When you leave this studio,” the Hollywood movie star Mark Wahlberg said after a recent pre-dawn session, “you feel like you can accomplish anything.”</p> <p>Wahlberg, who invested in the gym brand in 2019, has sold nearly $13mn worth of shares this year and remains one of the largest shareholders. The company completed an initial public offering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/374dacb3-b9f7-4848-9d27-8053c349e5d5\">valuing it at $1.4bn</a> last year after a lockdown-defying growth sprint that marked a stark contrast with YogaWorks, Town Sports International and other once-ubiquitous fitness operators that entered bankruptcy during the coronavirus pandemic. </p> <p>By the end of last year, F45 counted nearly 1,800 gyms in dozens of countries, and had signed contracts with local franchise operators to open about 1,500 more.</p> <p>Yet just as the broader <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ca0fbd4-0f7a-408b-9b77-8e576e2b62be\">gym industry is recovering</a>, F45 has run aground. The company's shares, which peaked at more than $17 a year ago, have recently traded as low as $1.35 and closed at $2.23 on Wednesday. In an unscheduled announcement last month, the chain said it was parting company with chief executive Adam Gilchrist, firing most of its workforce and cutting by about two-thirds the number of new gyms it expects to open this year. </p> <p>This week, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/689494d4-e7fd-465f-890f-3f606bace796\">F45</a> reported a quarterly net loss of $35mn on revenues of $30mn and announced it had begun searching for Gilchrist's successor. Interim chief executive Ben Coates said he was implementing a “cost reduction plan to align the company more closely with macroeconomic conditions and current business trends”.</p> <p>Those drastic actions — prompted by the sudden unavailability of an off-balance sheet financing facility that was supposed to fuel the latest stage of the company's growth — underscore how businesses that thrived on cheap capital during the pandemic are facing painful adjustments as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/global-inflation\">inflation </a>bites and central banks raise rates. </p> <p>“It doesn't need to be as big as it is,” said one person whose company has staked millions of dollars on F45's US expansion. “It was risky growth.”</p> <p>The reversal also points to vulnerabilities in a financial model that has until now been F45's strength. Shortly after opening its first gym in Sydney a decade ago, Gilchrist's team began turning the high-tech workout into a sophisticated franchise business that opened new locations at a pace rivalling the early years of McDonald's, Starbucks and other mighty brands. </p> <p>Unlike full-service gyms, which require expensive kit and cavernous real estate, F45 thrives in small spaces. At a recent session above a pharmacy in lower Manhattan, two coaches gave pep talks while TV screens showed the proper form for movements that included squats and crunches. A dozen class members completed the circuit, and by the end they seemed exhausted. “You crushed it,” one of the instructors told participants.</p> <p>Everything about that workout, from the choice of muscle-shredding resistance exercises to the blaring electro-synth remixes of 1980s pop songs, was devised at F45's corporate offices in Austin, Texas. But while programming decisions are made centrally, ownership of the gyms is local, with franchise operators putting up the capital and making their own decisions about where to set up, who to hire, and how much to charge.</p> <p>A typical proprietor is Donald Jordan, who is now suing the company, according to court filings from earlier this year. He enjoyed an F45 workout so much while travelling in the Middle East that, on returning home to Michigan, he signed up to open three gyms of his own on the outskirts of Detroit. </p> <p>Jordan agreed to pay a fee of at least $40,000 for each location he planned to open, according to franchise agreements reviewed by the Financial Times. He also committed to stock each location with $122,000 worth of equipment bought directly from F45, including heart monitors, sound system gear, weights, signage and staff uniforms. Jordan declined to comment. </p> <p>Those upfront charges, which fall due before a gym even opens its doors, account for a significant portion of the money F45 receives from franchisees. That may have encouraged top executives to focus on expansion. </p> <p>“What Adam really tried to do since the IPO is just turbocharge that growth,” said a person who has had extensive discussions with top F45 executives. “He did everything to try to meet the projections that he laid out. The result was a self-inflicted wound.”</p> <p>F45 did not provide a comment from Gilchrist, who is still a director of the company.</p> <p>Breakneck growth has made F45 a voracious consumer of capital since at least 2019, when Wahlberg contributed alongside other investors in a $110mn funding round. The former New Kids on the Block singer turned Oscar-nominated actor offers more than just money, promoting F45 on Instagram alongside other lifestyle businesses including Municipal gymwear, the Hallow prayer app, and a casual dining chain called Wahlburgers. </p> <p>“Mark's not going to get on a plane and go to your grand opening,” said one franchisee. “But if you're opening a gym in Las Vegas, he'll definitely show up if he's already there.”</p> <p>About a year after Wahlberg's investment, F45 made its first abortive attempt to go public, announcing a merger with Crescent Acquisition Corp, one of a breed of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a560343-69eb-4e36-9833-cc579a7dc8ad\">special purpose acquisition vehicles</a> that were at the centre of a feverish summer of Wall Street dealmaking. That transaction, which had been expected to value the gym chain at $845mn, fell apart. Instead, last year's IPO raised $279mn for the company, much of which was used to pay down debt.</p> <p>Twelve months later, all but $14mn of the remaining IPO cash has been spent, and F45 has come within $10mn of maxing out a $90mn line of bank credit that is one of its few remaining sources of liquidity. About $9mn of the total has gone to top executives in the form of bonuses, severance payments for Gilchrist, and a retention deal for the chief financial officer. Much of the rest was used to buy equipment that F45 expected to sell to new franchisees ahead of their grand openings. </p> <p>Some of that gear has been arriving at a container ship terminal near Los Angeles, according to company disclosures, but it is unclear when it will be needed. As recently as May, F45 announced a deal with Fortress Investment Group, an alternative asset manager, to provide $150mn in off-balance sheet financing that would have allowed franchisees to pay their start-up costs — including the money they owe F45 — with borrowed funds. </p> <p>That facility became unavailable after F45's falling share price tripped the Fortress facility's covenants. F45 executives held talks with Fortress about unblocking it in exchange for warrants or other sweeteners, according to two people familiar with the discussions, but the conversation went nowhere. F45 said it “had always contemplated exploring alternative franchise financing options”, and that no money had been drawn from Fortress when F45 formally terminated the facility on Sunday.</p> <p>Unable to borrow through F45 or to raise financing of their own, more than 170 would-be franchisees have cancelled contracts under which they were expected to open new gyms. Another 300 new openings could be subject to cancellation, although F45 says it expects many of those to go ahead as planned. </p> <p>While several gym operators told the FT they remained committed to F45 and planned to resume their expansion plans when financing becomes available, not everyone is so optimistic.</p> <p>Jordan, who once aspired to build his own fitness empire in Michigan, is instead fighting F45 in court. In a lawsuit filed earlier this year, he alleges the chain misled him about the likely profits at his three planned locations, a claim that F45 denies. Two of the three envisaged gyms never opened; at the third, Jordan estimates he has racked up losses of $1.3mn so far.</p><p>Source: Mark Vandevelde in New York 2022 'Mark Wahlberg-backed gym chain F45 goes from ab crunches to credit crunch' FT.com 18 August.
