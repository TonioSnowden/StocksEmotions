  "text": "<p>Meanwhile, Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal and Capital One Financial Corp. are postponing their return-to-office date, citing a rise Covid-19 cases. Capital One will require returning employees to be fully vaccinated, while NBC will require that status for U.S. employees.</p><p>McDonald's Global Chief People Officer Heidi Capozzi said in the message to U.S. employees: \"A resurgence of infections caused by Covid-19 variants has many of us uneasy.\" She added, \"We've heard from many of you that you would feel more comfortable returning to the office if you had more certainty your colleagues were vaccinated.\"</p><p>McDonald's, the largest U.S. burger chain in terms of sales and locations, said it is not mandating vaccinations for restaurant workers, but it is giving employees at its owned locations up to four hours of paid time off to do so. McDonald's vaccine mandate and Sept. 27 deadline also applies to suppliers and contractors who visit the company's headquarters or other U.S. offices, it said.</p><p>Capital One on Wednesday also delayed the reopening date for its offices from Sept 7. to Nov. 2. \"Unfortunately, we have watched the Delta variant tear a hole through the steady course of improvement in COVID-19 outcomes that we had been experiencing,\" Capital One Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank wrote in an email to employees. Mr. Fairbank's email also stated that the bank will require employees to be fully vaccinated when they return to the office. Returning to the office will be strongly encouraged for vaccinated employees, but not mandatory. Contractors, vendors and visitors to the bank's offices will also have to be vaccinated.</p><p>Unvaccinated employees will continue to work from home and will be \"supported\" in doing so, the email said. The company's vaccine policy will apply through at least the first quarter of 2022. The vaccine requirement doesn't apply to bank branch employees but Covid testing will be required for unvaccinated employees.</p><p>On the NBCUniversal developments, Comcast Chief Administration Officer Adam Miller said the company, which had been planning for a large-scale return to the office after Labor Day, is moving that date to Oct. 18 at the earliest. Until then, Mr. Miller wrote, employees who are fully vaccinated can return to the office on a voluntary basis.</p><p>NBCUniversal will require its U.S. employees returning to the office to be fully vaccinated, Mr. Miller wrote, and will require those employees to provide details of their vaccination status. In recent months, some employees at NBCUniversal's New York office have tested positive for Covid-19 after coming into the building, according to a person familiar with the matter. Another person said that number is relatively small compared with the nearly 10,000 employees who have been coming into the office daily.</p>",
