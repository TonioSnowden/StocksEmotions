  "title": "Where's My Midnight McMuffin?  Curtailed Menus Draw Protests  ---  Fans demand return of beloved items  that disappeared during the pandemic  ----  By Heather Haddon",
  "text": "<p>   Caitlyn Romanski was sitting in her car in a Panera Bread Co. parking lot, alone and confused. The 21-year-old college junior couldn't figure out what she would do without the Chicken Tortellini Alfredo that Panera had yanked from menus during the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>   There was no substitute for the comfort derived from that roughly $10 plate of pasta, the University of Kentucky student said. She didn't like Italian chain Fazoli's similar option as much. Olive Garden's was good, but more expensive. A self-described horrible cook prone to burning grilled cheese, Ms. Romanski resorted to making Knorr pasta packets at home. </p><p>   She took her grievance to the internet, starting a petition at Change.org calling on Panera to serve her favorite pasta again. She shared it with the site's more than 100 million users. More than 530 people have signed on to her cause. </p><p>   \"All that I ask is that they bring back the Chicken Tortellini Alfredo pasta back,\" the Chicago native said. </p><p>   A spokesman said that Panera couldn't guarantee tortellini pasta would return, but that other favorite items such as French onion soup have re-emerged. </p><p>   The pandemic has left Americans with fewer choices, whether it's motorcycles, Tab, Zico coconut water or cookies. </p><p>   Devoted customers have started social-media accounts and online petitions demanding that McDonald's Corp. bring back snack wraps and that KFC release potato wedges from purgatory. </p><p>   \"Without variety, there is boredom,\" Kinzey Baker, a 17-year-old high-school student in Ohio, wrote in her petition asking KFC to return potato wedges to its menu. \"We need flavor, we need texture, we need fun, we need our potato wedges!\" she wrote. </p><p>   KFC started taking potato wedges off menus before the pandemic as part of a move to new \"secret recipe\" fries and isn't looking back, said Andrea Zahumensky, the brand's U.S. CMO. </p><p>   \"It was time to bid farewell to our beloved potato wedges in favor of a new fan favorite,\" Ms. Zahumensky said. </p><p>   Change.org, a website started by two Stanford University students that calls itself \"the world's largest social change platform,\" has become a hotbed of agitation for food companies to bring back items they dropped during the pandemic. </p><p>   The site said the number of petitions calling for the return of a food item rose 66% last year to nearly 1,900. </p><p>   The online appeals have put some companies in a pickle. Those that discontinued less-popular or complicated items to simplify operations during the pandemic said they were able to cut down on supplies and staff training time. </p><p>   \"We've seen significant benefits with our streamlined menus,\" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said last month. That meant ending all-day breakfast early in the pandemic. </p><p>   That's not sitting well with some McGriddles and McMuffin fans. \"It can't be,\" said Randy Daye Jr., a 32-year-old Mercer, Pa., resident. \"Everyone I know loved the all-day breakfast.\" </p><p>   McDonald's official Twitter account responds almost daily to customers asking for all-day breakfast. \"We feel you,\" McDonald's recently wrote to a Twitter user who said she was pregnant and just wanted a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit at 12:30 a.m. \"We're still figuring out how and when to bring All Day Breakfast back to our menus.\" </p><p>   In addition to all-day breakfast, the burger giant axed grilled-chicken sandwiches, salads, bagels, Go-Gurt kids yogurt and other menu items around late March. Many haven't returned. </p><p>   Thousands of people have signed onto more than a dozen petitions calling for the return of snack wraps, an item that was sold regionally until June. </p><p>   \"What's Joe Biden's plan to bring back chicken snack wraps,\" one fan wrote on Twitter before the inauguration last month. </p><p>   Hundreds of people signed petitions calling for the return of Post Consumer Brands' Waffle Crisp cereal, which one described as tasting \"like watching Saturday morning cartoons in your pajamas.\" </p><p>   Post said in December that it would bring Waffle Crisp back. \"We saw the Change.org petitions . . . all three of them,\" Post wrote on Instagram. </p><p>   After a torrent of tweets about missing Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes and its Spicy Potato Soft Taco item, Taco Bell last month said it would bring them back in March. Taco Bell president Mark King said the chain was working with Beyond Meat Inc. on new plant-based proteins to satiate vegetarians miffed by their removal. </p><p>   \"It's a new year with new possibilities,\" Mr. King said in a video that featured his mouth and eyes superimposed onto a potato. \"We're working hard to make things right.\" </p><p>   Taco Bell hasn't budged on its decision last fall to drop Mexican Pizza -- so far. Krish Jagirdar, a 31-year-old partner at a New York venture-capital firm, said he and other South Asian Americans who don't eat meat grew up loving a vegetarian version of the pizza. Mr. Jagirdar made an online petition calling for the pizza's return. It drew nearly 160,000 signatures. </p><p>   \"I really just wanted to get the word out that this was happening,\" said Mr. Jagirdar, who said efforts to re-create thepizzas at home didn't hit the spot. </p><p>   David Gibbs, CEO of KFC- and Taco Bell-owner Yum Brands Inc., said Mexican Pizza could come back. </p><p>   \"One of the things about being in this role is, everywhere you go and when somebody finds out what you do, they have a lot of feedback and opinions and thoughts on our products and our menus,\" he said in an interview. </p><p></p>",
