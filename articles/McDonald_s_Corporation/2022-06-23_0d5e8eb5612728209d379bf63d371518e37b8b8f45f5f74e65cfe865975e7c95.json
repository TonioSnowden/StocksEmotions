  "text": "<p>In a shift that could affect some of the chain's longest-tenured restaurant operators, McDonald's is also requiring that next-generation heirs put up more cash to keep operating their locationsâ€”and to designate a single family member as the operator. Current McDonald's franchisees can designate several heirs, such as the children of a parent owner, to take over their McDonald's restaurants as part of their agreement with the chain.</p><p>\"This change is in keeping with the principle that receiving a new franchise term is earned, not given,\" McDonald's said in the message to franchisees regarding the changes.</p><p>Franchisees run 95% of the company's U.S. restaurants. McDonald's anticipates it will begin to implement the franchising changes next January</p><p>Write to Heather Haddon at heather.haddon@wsj.com</p><p>McDonald's &amp; Its Franchisees</p><p>* McDonald's to Back Diverse Restaurant Owners (Dec. 8, 2021)</p><p>* McDonald's Seeks Dismissal of Discrimination Lawsuit Filed by Black Former Franchisees (Oct. 23, 2020)</p><p>* McDonald's Franchisees Plan Push for Stronger Sales (Oct. 10, 2018)</p><p>* McDonald's Franchisees Grumble That Restaurants Are No Cash Cow (Oct. 9, 2018)</p><p>McDonald's Tightens Restaurant Ownership Rules as it Looks for New Franchisees</p>",
