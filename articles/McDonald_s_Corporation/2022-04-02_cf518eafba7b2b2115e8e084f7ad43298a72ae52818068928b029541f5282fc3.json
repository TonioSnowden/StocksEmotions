  "title": "REVIEW --- How Much Longer Can Baseball's 100-Year Monopoly Last? --- The Supreme Court has exempted the majors from antitrust claims because of the sport's unique status, but challenges are mounting.",
  "text": "<p>This legal protection has given baseball a privileged position and largely protected it from competition -- so far. Challenges have been brewing recently. Last year three Republican U.S. senators sought to remove the exemption as punishment for Major League Baseball's decision to move the All-Star game out of Georgia to protest the state's new voting law. This year a Democratic senator also endorsed the idea, out of frustration with the team owners' lockout of players that delayed Opening Day until April 7. Neither complaint, though, had much to do with the antitrust exemption's origin or effects.</p><p>In the early 1910s, the upstart Federal League was trying to establish itself as a third major baseball league alongside the American and National leagues. It enticed players away from the two established majors, but the leagues fought back in court and held players to their contracts, which all contained a \"reserve clause\" binding them to their teams for life. On top of that, the established ball clubs snapped up some of the Federal League's teams and either shut them down or imported them into their own leagues.</p><p>The new league folded in 1915 but not before suing the other two leagues and their club owners, claiming that baseball operated as a monopoly in violation of the Sherman Act, adopted in 1890. At the heart of the suit was the clause that gave teams the exclusive and perpetual right to re-sign, trade or \"reserve\" the player from being raided by any competitor. Players couldn't shop around; they couldn't apply for a job elsewhere or gain leverage for raises. The owners all committed not to poach each other's players. Monte Ward, a player and Columbia Law School alumnus, described the system as giving \"one set of men a life-estate in the labor of another.\"</p><p>The judge in the lawsuit delayed his ruling until the Federal League teams went bankrupt and mostly settled; he admitted in the courtroom that he was afraid an adverse decision would have harmed the game. Four years later that judge, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, was chosen by the club owners to be their first baseball commissioner.</p><p>One Federal League team refused to settle, however, and brought a new antitrust suit. The team won at the trial level, but the decision was overturned on appeal, and the case finally made its way to the high court. In 1922, the Supreme Court decided that baseball wasn't the type of interstate commerce intended to come under the Sherman Act, which at the time was primarily applied to trade in commodities. Eventually, the court's understanding of interstate commerce expanded to include businesses more like baseball, including other sports. But as any slugger understands, timing is everything.</p><p>In the century since, the Supreme Court has reconsidered its decision on a few occasions but has stuck to its precedent. The most memorable challenge, Flood v. Kuhn, came in 1972. Curt Flood was a star outfielder for the St. Louis Cardinals who woke up one day to discover that he had been traded to the Philadelphia Phillies. Flood objected, but he had little bargaining power. \"I do not feel I am a piece of property to be bought and sold irrespective of my wishes,\" Flood wrote to baseball's commissioner, Bowie Kuhn. When that failed, he sued, claiming that the reserve clause violated antitrust law.</p><p>The civil-rights movement loomed large in the background. Flood, a Black man, thought of himself as advancing economic rights of ballplayers, whose wages were being suppressed by a group of all-white owners. On television, sportscaster Howard Cosell challenged him: \"You're a man who makes $90,000 a year, which isn't exactly slave wages.\" Flood famously replied, \"a well-paid slave is nonetheless a slave.\"</p><p>Baseball's defense was, and has always been, that without the antitrust exemption the game could hardly survive. Clubs contend they need a guarantee that they'll recoup their investment in players; that baseball is inherently different from other businesses and more worthy of protection, because of its role in nurturing a cherished pastime at the heart of American culture; and that the sport has already relied on the exemption for a century. However, none of the other three major sports leagues in the U.S. enjoy such a privilege, and one of them, the National Football League, has higher revenues.</p><p>The lower-court decisions in Flood v. Kuhn predictably followed the Supreme Court's precedents. \"The game is on higher ground; it behooves everyone to keep it there,\" wrote the trial judge. Curt Flood's biographer Brad Snyder archly observed, \"There was something about baseball that turned cerebral judges into pennant-waving schoolboys.\"</p><p>The Supreme Court again decided to keep the exemption. Before Justice Harry Blackmun, who wrote for the majority, got to any of the legal issues in his opinion, he recounted \"the ensuing colorful days\" since baseball's founding, quoted two baseball poems and listed 88 legendary players by name.</p><p>\"To non-athletes, it might appear that petitioner was virtually enslaved by the owners of major league baseball clubs who bartered among themselves for his services,\" wrote Justice Thurgood Marshall in dissent. \"But athletes know that it was not servitude that bound petitioner to the club owners; it was the reserve system.\"</p><p>Though Flood lost the battle, the players ultimately won the war. Over time, the strength of the reserve clause was reduced through arbitration. Free agency was introduced in 1976, and in 1998, Congress passed the Curt Flood Act, which took away the exemption as it applies to major league players themselves.</p><p>But baseball still enjoys the exemption in other ways. Under the MLB constitution, each baseball club is assigned an exclusive geographical area. In any other industry, this would be patently illegal -- McDonald's can't veto a Burger King on the same block. When the Oakland A's were considering a move to San Jose, which is in the San Francisco Giants' territory, San Jose filed a lawsuit alleging that this territorial carve-up was illegal under the Sherman Act. It was thrown out of court.</p><p>And the exemption still benefits MLB in the minor leagues, where players make starvation wages and have virtually zero bargaining power. The latest court challenge, in fact, comes from minor-league owners accusing major-league teams of colluding in cutting affiliations with 40 minor-league teams. If the plaintiffs lose, they plan to appeal to the Supreme Court, where some see a spark of hope. In a 2021 case in which the NCAA was denied an exemption from the Sherman Act, Justice Neil Gorsuch signaled a willingness to reconsider baseball's exemption, using such adjectives as \"unrealistic,\" \"inconsistent\" and \"aberrational\" to describe it.</p><p>In the world outside of baseball, antitrust is having a moment thanks to public frustration over the dominance of big tech, rising corporate profits and a newly invigorated agenda in the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission. For baseball's privileged exemption, it may be the bottom of the ninth with two outs and two strikes.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Ufberg is co-founder of New Vessel Press and a student at Berkeley Law School.
