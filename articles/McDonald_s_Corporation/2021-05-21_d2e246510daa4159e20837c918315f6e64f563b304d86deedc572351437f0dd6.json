Take our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2021-05-21/\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd1db09d-13d2-465a-a7aa-a4aa0ffdaa91\">came into force early on Friday</a> ending an 11-day conflict that has killed at least 232 Palestinians and 12 Israelis.</p> <p>The Egypt-mediated truce triggered celebrations on the streets of Hamas-controlled Gaza, as the worst fighting in seven years came to a close. </p> <p>The fighting led to huge levels of destruction across the densely populated Gaza strip, which is home to 2m people, as Israeli warplanes and artillery attacked Hamas positions. </p> <p>The truce followed “intensive high-level discussions, hour by hour” from the&#xa0;US, including multiple calls between President Joe Biden and his counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu. </p> <p>The US president had come under intense pressure from members of his own Democratic party in recent days, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c49d151-2635-41ee-9a63-73b241e048ce\">including congresswoman Rashida Tlaib</a>, to take action to end the conflict. </p> <p>Egypt, which mediated the ceasefire along with the US and Qatar, said on Thursday it would send two security delegations to Tel Aviv and the Palestinian territories to ensure the implementation of the ceasefire. </p> <p><em>US foreign policy and defence correspondent Katrina Manson talks to the </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7cda7f50-546b-4f14-b2f8-ad6e507bc18a\"><em>FT News Briefing podcast</em></a><em> on the prospects for the ceasefire.</em></p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>China</strong> vaccinated more people against coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c8473cb-a3b1-4178-a65d-e136793548cc\">in 10 days this month</a> than it did in the first quarter, catapulting it into the top five countries for&#xa0;<a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker\">daily delivered doses</a>&#xa0;on a per capita basis.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Japan</strong> has approved the Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines for Covid-19 but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e71d01f-d825-4642-8071-99f547aacc3f#post-1abba91f-12d9-43d7-8d0e-41d268a9c739\">it will not use</a> the AstraZeneca jab in its public programme.</p></li>  <li><p>Joe Biden has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e71d01f-d825-4642-8071-99f547aacc3f#post-6cd3f82d-2d8b-40d1-997e-5807aed46130\">signed into law</a> a bill aimed at addressing the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes in the <strong>US </strong>during the pandemic. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Argentina</strong> has introduced <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e71d01f-d825-4642-8071-99f547aacc3f#post-00071551-8ed7-4c94-81a8-217318cbd669\">new curbs</a> on business and leisure operations as it tries to ward off a new wave of coronavirus infections.</p></li>  <li><p>Activity at <strong>eurozone</strong> businesses <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8208eca-3932-4783-b8a5-23e82e198223\">has expanded</a> at the fastest pace for more than three years, according to a closely watched survey released on Friday.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Follow the latest on our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e71d01f-d825-4642-8071-99f547aacc3f\"><em>live blog</em></a><em> and </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/newslettersignup-coronavirus\"><em>sign up</em></a><em> for our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-business-update\"><em>Coronavirus Business Update</em></a> <em>newsletter.</em></p> <h2>In the news</h2> <p><strong>US proposes global corporate tax rate of at least 15%</strong> The Biden administration has signalled that it will accept a 15 per cent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d41da77e-93d0-4b96-95c3-98ca3f9a6696\">global minimum tax</a> on large multinational companies, in international talks aimed at increasing revenues from corporations that operate across borders.</p> <p><strong>Morgan Stanley shake-up </strong>Chief executive James Gorman kicked off a succession battle with a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/248cbea8-6dbe-4c97-b194-e68dbe121d1f\">string of leadership changes</a> at the US bank, including the promotion of two top deputies, Ted Pick and Andy Saperstein.

What is more surprising, though, is the criticism from some former officials in previous Democratic administrations, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ecf08d1b-88e3-4c0e-ae3d-8242f52db278\">writes Gillian Tett.</a></p> <p><strong>The hypocritical attack on chief executive pay</strong> Pay revolts are very much in keeping with the ESG zeitgeist. But institutional investors are bothering too much about pay at high-performing companies. Rather than trying to make chief executives poorer they should worry about making their clients richer, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07edfbb2-783f-481a-9e70-79ca1d643b87\">argues companies editor Tom Braithwaite</a>.</p> <p><strong>How can the world get to net zero emissions by 2050?</strong> The International Energy Agency <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9a03568-1cb1-4218-a519-5fcbe528d03a\">has mapped out a pathway</a> that it says is “narrow but still achievable” if the world is to cut carbon dioxide emissions to nearly zero and limit global warming to 1.5C. But meeting this goal would require a total transformation of the global economy over the next three decades.</p> <p><strong>Vaccine row shows why we need to rethink intellectual property</strong> Once upon a time, monarchs would hand out monopolies to favourites, but a modern society cannot be handing out IP to whoever seems most sympathetic, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28f6db2b-3459-44a6-bc86-5191a2952ba7\">says Tim Harford</a>. </p> <p><strong>Why we travel — and why we shouldn't stop </strong>Tourism is back but not as we knew it. Tom Robbins argues that for all its flaws, the industry <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/fd66019e-d960-4187-968f-ca2206081f30\">deserves to be brought back to life</a>: “The reality is that there is good tourism and bad tourism, and we need to think more often about the difference.”</p> <h2>Video of the day</h2> <p><strong>We know what you did during lockdown</strong> We gave up our privacy to fight Covid-19, can we get it back? <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/0685a4ba-7b0b-442b-b38e-3f73101a6943?playlist-name=editors-picks&amp;playlist-offset=0\">An FT Film </a>explores how Covid-19 has exposed the tension between the need for data to track and trace, and the right to privacy and justice.</p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Jennifer Creery and Emily Goldberg  2021 'FirstFT: Today's top stories' FT.com 21 May.
