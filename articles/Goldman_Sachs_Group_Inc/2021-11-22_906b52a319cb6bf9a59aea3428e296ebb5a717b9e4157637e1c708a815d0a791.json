  "text": "<p>Italy's Eni said it planned to retain a 70 per cent stake in the retail and renewable power business it intends to list next year, and that it will rename it Plenitude.</p> <p>The planned initial public offering of its retail, renewables and mobility units is the biggest structural move yet by an oil and gas major in response to pressure to reduce carbon emissions and pivot to greener forms of energy.</p> <p>Claudio Descalzi, Eni's chief executive, said on Monday that the new business, which aims to deliver fully decarbonised energy products to all its customers by 2040, would be able to grow faster on its own.</p> <p>“This will free up more cash for Plenitude, the new company, to develop renewables by itself and leave us more space, more free cash flow to invest in the transformation of the company,” he told the Financial Times.</p> <p>Eni plans to sell up to 30 per cent of the new company, Descalzi said, in a process to be run by Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse and Italian investment bank Mediobanca.</p> <p>Oil and gas producers, which face a higher cost of capital than pure renewables businesses, are under pressure to invest more in clean energy while still generating profits from legacy assets to pay shareholders and fund the transition.</p> <p>So far most competitors, including Shell and BP, have argued that they will be better able to succeed as integrated companies. Eni predicts that under the new structure Plenitude will have access to cheaper funding, but still benefit from the continued integration of the renewables division and the gas and power retail business.</p> <p>Eni said the name, which means abundance, was chosen to represent the new company's “integrated, diverse proposition” as well as its “end to end approach to sustainability”.</p> <p>The three divisions, dominated by retail business Eni gas e luce which has about 10m customers, is forecast to make combined earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of €600m this year. Eni hopes that will rise to €1.3bn by 2025.</p> <p>Descalzi said he would not speculate on a potential valuation for the new company because of the different multiples the market tended to apply to renewables companies compared with traditional retail businesses. “We are the first to put together and create this type of vehicle,” he said.</p> <p>RBC Capital Markets has forecast a possible valuation of “close to €10bn” based on a figure about eight times the 2025 earnings forecast.</p> <p>Eni said Plenitude would have net debt of about zero at the start of 2022 and invest an average of €1.8bn a year until 2025, with about 80 per cent of capex focused on renewable power generation. </p> <p>Eni's renewable power arm at present has almost 2GW of installed capacity. The company expects that to grow to 6GW by 2025 and 15GW by 2030. BP, in comparison, aims to have 20GW of renewable energy capacity by 2025 and 50GW by 2030.</p> <p>The mobility arm is the second-largest operator of vehicle-charging points in Italy with 6,500 across the country. It plans to roll out more than 31,000 charging points by 2030, including an expansion of the network into other parts of Europe.</p> <p>As part of broader efforts to transform Eni and realise more value during the energy transition, Descalzi said he was also considering an initial public offering for Norway's Var Energi, in which Eni holds a 70 per cent stake.</p> <p>“To face this transition you need a new business, a new financial model, you cannot do business as usual,” he said.</p><p>Source: Tom Wilson in London 2021 'Eni renames transition spin-off Plenitude ahead of planned IPO' FT.com 22 November.
