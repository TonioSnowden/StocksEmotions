  "title": "Ukrainian Startups Secure Funding Even as War Endures; Early-stage investor FF Venture Capital raises $30 million fund to invest in Ukrainian companies and founders",
  "text": "<p>\"Our thesis is that Ukraine will win the war, will become a member of the European Union and there will be plenty of money flowing for the country to innovate,\" said Mr. Adamski. \"We believe the money will be there because the talent and government support will be there.\"</p><p>FFVC's Blue &amp; Yellow Heritage Fund, which recalls the colors of the Ukrainian flag, will invest in startups working on enterprise software, financial technology and several other industries.</p><p>When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February, Ukraine had just come off its best funding year ever. In 2021, Ukrainian companies garnered $832 million in venture capital and private equity, with more than half coming from outside the country, according to AVentures Capital, a Ukraine-based investment firm. Funding grew almost 50% over the previous year and the 28 exits in 2021 set a record.</p><p>While Ukrainian startups have proven resilient since the invasion—with many relocating at least some of their employees either to towns in the country's west or to Poland and other parts of Europe—valuations and funding have shriveled, according to local investors.</p><p>There is no data yet available on how much they have shrunk. However, the value of venture capital-backed funding rounds worldwide fell almost 60% in August compared with the same month last year in the wake of surging inflation and the economic slowdown, while the number of transactions fell by almost a quarter, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>Mykhailo Sapiton, an analyst at SID Venture Partners, estimates that the number of Ukrainian venture capital deals is down by at least 50% this year compared with the same period in 2021. But he expects a quick spring back, with funding returning to its prewar level by the end of next year. SID, which relocated most of its employees from Ukraine to Lisbon after the invasion, has invested in 13 Ukrainian startups this year.</p><p>\"Ukrainian startups are forced to look abroad for funding and markets even more than before and that's positive in the long run,\" said Mr. Sapiton.</p><p>As those startups look beyond their borders, that could be a buying opportunity for western funds. Before the war, the most active foreign funds in Ukraine included Andreessen Horowitz, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., TMT Investments PLC and Almaz Capital, according to AVentures.</p><p>Ukraine has had some recent blockbuster startup success stories. Three Ukrainians founded Grammarly, a spelling and grammar assistant that uses artificial intelligence, and recently received a $13 billion valuation. Several other startups backed by western venture capital topped the $1 billion valuation last year.</p><p>\"It's hard for western VCs to accept the risk of the war, but the reward is potentially very big,\" said Nykyta Izmaylov, the founder of N1, a relatively small investment fund that has relocated many of its workers to Lisbon. \"The hardest part for a startup is usually finding the right people and in many cases in Ukraine they are in place and just need the war to end.\"</p><p>In June, N1 invested $500,000 in a fintech startup, which Mr. Izmaylov says likely would have cost at least five times that amount before the start of the war. Another company he might invest in had a $7 million valuation before the war and that has fallen to about $1 million.</p><p>For some startups, attracting foreign investment comes with upsides, including often a relatively higher valuation than they would get from a domestic fund, a bigger check and partners who can be a bridge to later-stage investors, something that many Ukrainian startups struggle with.</p><p>\"Attracting foreign investments was crucial to not only get cash, but also to work with committed, smart partners to support us in technical product development and our growth strategy, especially in the U.S., which is our main market right now,\" said Anastasiia Gliebova, chief executive and co-founder of V-Art, a Ukrainian startup that uses blockchain technology to license brands' digital art, photos and other content.</p><p>Despite the war, V-Art's revenue has risen more than fivefold since the beginning of the year, she said. The two-year-old company, which counts SID as one of its investors, is aiming to raise more money next year to fund its expansion plans.</p><p>Recent battlefield gains have buoyed Ukrainian founders and investors, but many said a realization has set in that the conflict is likely to drag on for some time.</p><p>\"Many people in the Ukrainian startup community joined the army, but many others decided that their best contribution would be to keep doing what we used to do—build businesses that add value, bring foreign money to Ukraine and employ people here,\" said Alex Serdiuk, the CEO of Respeecher, which makes voice-cloning software that is used in films and television shows.</p><p>Write to Eric Sylvers at eric.sylvers@wsj.com</p><p>Ukrainian Startups Secure Funding Even as War Endures</p>",
