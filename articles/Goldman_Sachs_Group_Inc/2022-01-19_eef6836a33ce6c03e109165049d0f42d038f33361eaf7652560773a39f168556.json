  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>New data today showed UK prices rose at their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9188e191-4c1c-4968-a3af-9a43f086de6b\">highest rate for 30 years</a> in December, fuelling the country's cost-of-living crisis and putting more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates.</p> <p>Consumer price inflation hit 5.4 per cent in December, up from 5.1 per cent the previous month, and could yet pass six per cent in the spring when energy price rises take effect, just as new tax increases kick in. Both will hit poorer households particularly hard, as will the continuing growth in food prices, one of the key contributors to December's increase.</p> <p>Inflation was also running significantly ahead of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8c8fd49-70f2-4d7e-953d-9ee7b00db00c\">earnings</a>, which rose at just 3.8 per cent in the three months to November, despite labour shortages.</p> <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, speaking to MPs in Westminster this afternoon, acknowledged that higher inflation would last longer than originally forecast. Investors now expect four UK rate rises from the BoE by November. </p> <p>Pressure to increase rates to combat inflation is being felt by policymakers across the world. In the eurozone, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd81b2e6-652b-4c0e-ba17-ed2679c34762\">bond market investors</a> are betting that central banks will speed up their attempts to withdraw stimulus programmes, while in the US, investors are now pricing in up to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb684de4-fa00-4791-a062-fdcd737a08d2\">four rate rises </a>from the Fed this year. </p> <p>Fear of rising inflation has even spread to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/716d4d9e-da87-4ecd-9414-969bdb36406e\"> policymakers in Japan</a>, a country that has battled against deflation for decades. </p> <p>Oil prices meanwhile continued their upward trajectory, hitting a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70f58398-8911-45d3-b1b0-cc16c4ac184d\">seven-year high</a> on Tuesday. The US has urged leading producers to speed up production to help control inflation but Opec and its allies have stuck to their plan for more gradual increases.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/088d3368-bb8b-4ff3-9df7-a7680d4d81b2\"><em>Bookmark this</em></a><em>: Our global inflation tracker allows you to track data and trends by country, including house prices and food costs.</em></p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The rate of US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f12f0ae-7df4-4a0e-ab24-52bf9b378d6e#post-0f3cf490-779b-4596-86db-4d1bbd624c88\">new home construction</a> climbed to its highest level in nine months in December </p></li>  <li><p>Canadian consumer prices hit their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f12f0ae-7df4-4a0e-ab24-52bf9b378d6e#post-9a0bec29-27f5-449b-ba1e-07afd288b76f\">highest level in 30 years</a></p></li>  <li><p>Infections in the Americas have reached a new peak with 7.2m new cases in the past week (Reuters)</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f12f0ae-7df4-4a0e-ab24-52bf9b378d6e\"><em>live blog</em></a><em> or catch up with our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/top-stories-today\"><em>Top Stories Today</em></a><em> audio summary for the latest news in under three minutes. </em></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p><strong>UK business groups</strong> welcomed today's government decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f12f0ae-7df4-4a0e-ab24-52bf9b378d6e#post-ef202925-6742-41a9-bdf1-a45396b7f4b5\">end Covid restrictions</a> in England. Matthew Fell, CBI chief policy director, spoke of “clear benefits to being in the office, such as collaboration and on-the-job learning”. “Blanket work-from-home guidance has had significant downsides for city centre trade in sectors such as hospitality and retail,” he added.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>Our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9348c644-288f-42e7-9f4b-edea8b71be5b\">new interactive</a> reveals the damage wreaked by the pandemic on the <strong>UK's high streets</strong>. Central London and other large cities, perhaps unsurprisingly, have suffered most from lockdowns and the shift to remote working, but the damage is widespread. Enter your postcode to see how your local services have fared.</p> <h2>Global latest</h2> <p><strong>Bill Gates </strong>called for governments to invest in preventing the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1ab6cee-4f84-4a85-9c53-9f5f444359d4\">next global pandemic</a>. The philanthropist lamented the failure to address vaccine inequity: “When we talk about spending billions to save . . . trillions of economic damage and tens of billions of lives, it's a pretty good insurance policy,” he said. The UN urged <strong>pharma companies</strong> to make Covid shots more widely available: its strategy to vaccinate 40 per cent of people in all countries by the end of 2021 and 70 per cent by the middle of this year is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d0364cf-dde6-4c7c-a14a-461f73894b19#post-31deefa8-86bd-476e-976a-8207a7880463\">well behind target</a>.</p> <p>The World Bank warned of a wave of “disorderly defaults” from the <strong>world's poorest countries</strong> as they face up to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b5f4b54-2f80-4bda-9df7-9e74a3c8a66a\">$11bn</a> surge in debt repayments after using the capital markets to fund their pandemic response. A G20 plan to help indebted countries has fallen far short of expectations.</p> <p>Our new special report <strong>The World 2022 </strong>examines the continuing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/world-2022\">fallout from the pandemic</a> and the other global challenges facing policymakers, from rising inflation to climate change.</p> <p><strong>Venezuelan</strong> president Nicólas Maduro said his country had returned to growth for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03e918f5-e316-483e-871a-bf47da919340\">first time in eight years</a>, ending a period during which its economy had shrunk by 75 per cent, turning what was one of the largest economies in South America into one of its smallest. The FT Editorial Board highlighted the challenges facing the region, calling for “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c53ac469-4f3e-4cb3-af4a-e2c9c842aa36\">pragmatic solutions</a> that leave behind ideological debate”.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/924cd998-aa89-460c-a745-ed8f5b881c1d\">Monday's Road to Recovery</a> we described how China's “zero-Covid” policy was hitting domestic consumption. It's now hitting <strong>domestic animals</strong>. After suspected cases of animal-to-human transmission, Hong Kong is culling hamsters and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48bcaeea-4478-4cef-b728-60079e06cbd9\">quarantining visitors to pet stores</a>.</p> <h1>Need to know: business</h1> <p>One business sector that continues to shine is luxury goods. <strong>Burberry </strong>today raised its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/887aa4f2-1fa2-4def-ab74-ac465bc0c938\">full-year profit forecasts</a> after sales rose more than expected in its latest quarter. <strong>Prada</strong> and <strong>Richemont</strong> have also reported surges in sales.</p> <p>The picture is very different for the auto industry. Shares in <strong>Toyota</strong>, the world's biggest carmaker and Japan's most valuable company, yesterday suffered their worst intraday fall since the pandemic began, after it said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f12f0ae-7df4-4a0e-ab24-52bf9b378d6e#post-a7765229-6840-4509-8045-eb74da7efb60\">semiconductor shortages</a> would be likely to cause it to miss its annual production target.</p> <p>Record investment banking and wealth management income helped <strong>Bank of America'</strong>s profit jump 28 per cent in the fourth quarter. However, profits at Wall Street rival <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83fea40d-eae7-4386-be34-013ed963589e\">fell 13 per cent</a> year on year, thanks to bumper bonus payouts and a drop off in revenues at its trading arm. Goldman's full-year profits hit $21.2bn, more than double 2020. <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> also reported falls in trading revenues, accompanied by a small rise in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7c1961f-09c4-4109-8c25-89acb00264b9\">investment banking</a>.<br><br>Boris Johnson's staff would have been better off partying down their local <strong>Wetherspoon's </strong>rather than allegedly breaking lockdown rules in their Downing Street offices, the UK pub chain said as it warned of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f12f0ae-7df4-4a0e-ab24-52bf9b378d6e#post-96678f29-174d-47e8-b259-6ca4b54f22e9\">first-half losses</a>. As well as plenty of highly trained managers able to deal with high jinks and ample CCTV, the company said “there would have been a number of advantages for the nation”.</p> <h1>The World of Work</h1> <p>Whether through choice or necessity, many workers have taken up <strong>second jobs </strong>during the pandemic, but how should managers deal with team members' “side hustles”?
