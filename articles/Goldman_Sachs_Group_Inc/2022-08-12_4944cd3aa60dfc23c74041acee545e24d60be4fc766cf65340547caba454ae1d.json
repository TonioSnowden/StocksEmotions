  "title": "'The War of Nerves' Review: The Age of Nuclear Paranoia; Was the Cold War between the Soviet world and the West an economic and political one—or a largely psychological struggle?",
  "text": "<p>This is not a new argument. It was a staple of nuclear disarmament and nuclear freeze movements, from the 1950s through the 1980s, to cast the entire Cold War standoff as a kind of global psychopathology, a product of irrational fear, hysteria and \"attribution error,\" in which both sides shared blame in precisely equal proportion for a conflict that was about nothing but conflict itself.</p><p>Suggesting that the psychological dimension is neglected territory for Cold War scholars, Mr. Sixsmith in his preface tosses off an airy dismissal of conventional accounts of the period. \"Histories of the Cold War—charting facts and dates, speeches and events, stalemates and standoffs—are not in short supply.\" But neither, in fact, are serious treatments of the question that Mr. Sixsmith says he is out to examine, \"the way this extraordinary period shaped not just the experiences but the thinking of millions of people.\"</p><p>One of the very first histories of the era, Eric F. Goldman's near contemporaneous \"The Crucial Decade,\" described the period 1945–1955 as the \"Years of Neuroses.\" And as John Lewis Gaddis notes in his superb 2005 synthesis, \"The Cold War: A New History,\" political scientists have long recognized the existence of \"security dilemmas,\" in which each side reacts to the efforts of the other to make itself safer, resulting in \"an ever-deepening whirlpool of distrust from which even the best-intentioned and most farsighted leaders find it difficult to extricate themselves: their suspicions become self-reinforcing.\" The Byzantine psychological ramifications of a conflict in which war could be threatened but never fought due to the atomic bomb have always been front and center to its practitioners and chroniclers.</p><p>Mr. Sixsmith is no apologist for Soviet Communism. He makes clear at the outset that he sees the roots of the U.S.-Soviet rivalry in fundamentally incompatible values, the West espousing freedom and individuality, Russia servitude and collective security. A student of Russian literature and a former BBC correspondent stationed in Washington and Moscow, he writes admiringly of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher for their psychological acumen and willingness to break free from conventional Cold War thinking. One of his most psychologically penetrating and haunting chapters looks at the soul-crushing effectiveness of the fear that Communist states instilled in the minds of their own citizens. He quotes the Czech film director Miloš Forman: \"The worst evil was self-censorship, because that twists minds; that destroys your character. . . . That's what they wanted; they wanted everyone to feel guilty.\"</p><p>Mr. Sixsmith also offers a well-wrought psychological portrait of double agents, above all their egotistic sense of having escaped the conventional norms of human conduct. While some were driven by money, none regarded what they had done as treason. To become a spy in the first place was to enter a world unloosed from ethical moorings, in which the larger purpose and justification were quickly swallowed by the nature and demands of the job itself. As a 1954 White House report on CIA covert operations concluded: \"There are no rules in such a game.\"</p><p>This is an aspect of the Cold War conflict where Mr. Sixsmith's focus on the psychological, and the hall-of-mirrors symmetry of the opposing sides, is its most persuasive. In fact, I wish he had pursued the point further to explore the devastating loss of trust in government that remains the enduring psychological hangover of America's Cold War embrace of covert operations. \"Plausible deniability,\" conceived as a way to have it both ways—free to engage in espionage, economic sabotage, disinformation, subversion, covert military action, and other tactics long associated with despotic regimes, while publicly upholding traditional American principles of truth, openness, and fair play—left a deep scar in the nation's psychological and moral fabric.</p><p>The perspicacity of Mr. Sixsmith's insights varies considerably. He draws nuanced psychological portraits of Stalin and Reagan, but elsewhere, particularly in his one-dimensional analysis of Harry Truman's decision-making, does not venture beyond pop-psychology bromides. He has fun pointing out the phallic and orgasmic imagery of nuclear weaponry depicted in \"Dr. Strangelove,\" but misses here an opportunity to probe one of the more serious psychological consequences of the Cold War. The film's entire dark comedy, after all, turns on the disconnect between the nuclear-strike mission the U.S. military has relentlessly trained to carry out and the utter incredulity of all involved when an order is actually given to do so. The mental gymnastics and dissociation required to make \"credible\" a threat that only a lunatic would deliver on, apotheosized at the height of the Cold War in the deployment of tens of thousands of battlefield nuclear weapons (even nuclear land mines and artillery shells) is a rich subject that still awaits the treatment it deserves.</p><p>The author's focus on the psychological becomes a distorting lens when he turns to the origins of the Cold War. In trying so hard to apportion the fault of misperception to both sides, he takes at face value an assertion by a Russian official that \"conflict might have been avoided if the West had paid more attention to Soviet sensitivities,\" and portrays Stalin, for all his acknowledged bluffing and lying, as fundamentally justified in the positions he took from the perspective of Soviet perceptions of their own interests. \"Ultimately, and ironically,\" Mr. Sixsmith insists, \"the Cold War would grow from disagreements about the best way to maintain prosperity and peace, not from a desire on either side to fight.\"</p><p>Here is where messy historical facts intrude upon Mr. Sixsmith's neatly wrought psychodrama. For instance: From the very start of America's entry into World War II, FDR pledged to pursue a postwar settlement that would avoid the mistakes of the past. \"This time we will know how to make full use of victory,\" he promised in 1942. Woodrow Wilson's vision of a League of Nations would be revived in a United Nations with power to deter and punish aggression; the World Bank and International Monetary Fund would stabilize the world's economies to head off the depressions and economic upheavals that were seen as a major cause of wars. As John Lewis Gaddis observes, this was \"a multilateral vision that assumed the possibility of compatible interests, even among incompatible systems.\" Stalin, on the other hand, \"assumed no such thing.\" Ideologically committed to the belief that the collapse of capitalism was inevitable and capitalist states were certain to go to war with one another, he steadfastly worked to undermine U.S. efforts for stability, peace and reconstruction in war-ravaged Europe. \"The coming of peace,\" Mr. Gaddis notes, \"accomplished the only objective—military victory—that the U.S.S.R. shared with anyone else.\"</p><p>Mr. Sixsmith skates lightly over all of this history. He barely mentions the series of Soviet actions that finally dashed Americans' expectations, widely held across the political spectrum, that postwar cooperation with its wartime ally would continue. Regarding Stalin's commitment at Yalta to free elections in Poland and the Baltic states, Mr. Sixsmith writes, \"Stalin was worried about the future security of the Soviet Union—he admitted as much—but there is no indication that he felt he was reneging on the agreements he had made.\" In fact, Stalin admitted privately that was exactly what he was doing. \"Don't worry,\" he reassured his foreign minister. \"We can implement it in our own way later. The heart of the matter is the correlation of forces.\"</p><p>These were not \"disagreements about the best way to maintain prosperity and peace\": Stalin simply had no interest in peace, stability or prosperity for Europe, which he expected would sooner or later fall under complete Soviet domination. \"All Germany must be ours,\" he commented in 1946.</p><p>Even so, it was not until the 1948 Soviet-backed Communist coup in Czechoslovakia left no possible doubt as to Stalin's intentions—another of those pesky \"facts and dates\" Mr. Sixsmith does not trouble himself with—that isolationist Republican senators like Robert Taft, who had initially joined the Soviets in denouncing the Marshall Plan (\"global New Dealism,\" the Taftites jeered), swung their support behind this decisive declaration of American commitment to Europe and containment of Soviet ambitions.</p><p>In trying to balance the ledger, Mr. Sixsmith repeatedly equates actual Soviet transgressions with American transgressions that existed solely in Russian imagination and propaganda. In 1948, the U.S. State Department published the text of the secret Hitler–Stalin Pact that perfidiously divvied up Poland between the two states in 1939. \"The release of the Secret Protocol signaled the end of restraint,\" the author writes. \"Psychological warfare would no longer be shackled by ethical considerations; lies and fake news became as powerful as the truth.\" But of course there was nothing unethical, much less fake, in releasing the verbatim text of this historically shocking document. The same could hardly be said for the Soviet fabrication that followed: a false story accusing the U.S. of attacking East Germans' potato crop with biological weapons.</p><p>Mr. Sixsmith predictably invokes the phenomenon of confirmation bias—the psychological tendency to seek out evidence confirming a pre-existing belief—to explain many of the mutual misperceptions of the Cold War. It is a failing, alas, that afflicts authors too.</p><p>Mr. Budiansky's books include \"Code Warriors: NSA's Codebreakers and the Secret Intelligence War Against the Soviet Union\" and \"Journey to the Edge of Reason: The Life of Kurt Gödel.\"</p><p>'The War of Nerves' Review: The Age of Nuclear Paranoia</p>",
