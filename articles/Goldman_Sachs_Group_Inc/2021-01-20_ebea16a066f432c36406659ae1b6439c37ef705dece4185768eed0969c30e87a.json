In a sign of the nervousness in Washington, a dozen National Guard soldiers were removed from inauguration duties on Tuesday, including two who were removed due to suspected links to extreme rightwing groups.</p> <p>In one of his final acts as president, Donald Trump pardoned <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f90bf48e-3d49-4f17-8c56-4f3a42471f06\">Steve Bannon</a>, his former top White House aide, who was charged last year with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4c7e924-0252-4ec4-89ef-7c1716ae6b71\">defrauding hundreds of thousands of Trump supporters</a> who donated to a crowdfunding campaign to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. Mr Bannon had pleaded not guilty and was released on bail pending his trial.</p> <p>Rapper Lil Wayne, who recently pleaded guilty to possessing a loaded, gold-plated handgun and faced up to 10 years in prison, was also among the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-regarding-executive-grants-clemency-012021/\">more than 100</a> individuals from the worlds of business, politics and entertainment to be pardoned.</p> <p>The pardons came in the final hours of one of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/272e81f3-b731-4c28-b4c2-9eb798717b46\">the most tumultuous presidencies</a> in US history that ended in the storming of the Capitol building.</p> <p>Mitch McConnell, the outgoing Republican Senate majority leader, on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50c5b978-1339-436d-b3bf-5987cf1ca87f\">blamed the outgoing president</a> for the siege on January 6 ahead of an impeachment trial that will begin once Mr Trump leaves office. </p> <p>In his final pre-recorded remarks before he departs the US capital for Florida, Mr Trump said the movement he started as US president was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/edc2f7ad-5458-4ee4-9040-3da0a19461bc\">“only just beginning”</a>.
