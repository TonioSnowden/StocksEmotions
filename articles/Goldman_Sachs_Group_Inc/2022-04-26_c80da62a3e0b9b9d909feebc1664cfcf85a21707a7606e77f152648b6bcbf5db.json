  "title": "It's 'Hollywood Liberal' vs. 'Wall Street Insider' in Pennsylvania Negative-Ad Fight; Dr. Oz and former hedge-fund CEO David McCormick spend millions to tarnish each other in a key Senate GOP primary",
  "text": "<p>Mr. McCormick, 56 years old, is a West Point graduate and former Treasury Department official who until January ran the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates. Mr. Oz, 61, is a physician and star of \"The Dr. Oz Show,'' the health-focused program that ended its 13-season television run in January.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Which Senate candidate do you think GOP voters will choose in the Pennsylvania primary, and why? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Now, each man is trying to turn the other's accomplishments into liabilities. Mr. Oz's campaign casts Mr. McCormick as a \"Wall Street insider\" and highlights his former firm's investments in China. Mr. McCormick's allies portray Mr. Oz as a \"Hollywood liberal\" who has called for gun restrictions and praised Hillary Clinton and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who most conservatives deeply dislike.</p><p>Each says the other is insincere in backing the Trump-style \"America First\" principles that many GOP voters support, though Mr. Oz won help in blunting that argument when former President Donald Trump endorsed him this month.</p><p>\"All you're really hearing is them dissing each other,\" said Maryann Bricker, a Republican voter in the central Pennsylvania borough of Carlisle. \"It's all very confusing to me, because you don't know what to believe.\" Her takeaway: \"I don't personally care for either one of those candidates.\"</p><p>While negative ads are a staple of political campaigns, voters in Pennsylvania have little prior information to help them judge what they are hearing, as neither Messrs. McCormick nor Oz has run for office before or taken a high profile in the state's civic life. Though both have Pennsylvania roots, they had lived elsewhere for much of their adult lives and moved back only recently.</p><p>Both parties say the Pennsylvania race is particularly important in determining control of the Senate next year, one reason it has drawn significant campaign spending. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is retiring, creating the only open GOP-held seat this cycle in a state President Joe Biden carried in 2020.</p><p>Because it is easier to win an open seat than to defeat an incumbent, Democrats see a pickup opportunity, while Republicans are eager to defend the seat. The winner of the May 17 GOP primary will compete in November against the winner of the Democratic contest, in which Lt. Gov John Fetterman and Rep. Conor Lamb are the leading candidates.</p><p>Both Messrs. McCormick and Oz have used their wealth to push to the front of the multicandidate scramble for the GOP nomination. Mr. McCormick has lent his campaign nearly $7 million and Mr. Oz about $11 million, Federal Election Commission records show. The money, combined with millions of dollars from allied groups, has funded the second-most expensive Senate primary of the year so far as measured by TV ads, after the Republican contest in Ohio, data from the ad-tracking firm AdImpact shows.</p><p>Other Republicans in the May 17 primary include Carla Sands, the U.S. ambassador to Denmark under Mr. Trump; businessman Jeff Bartos, the GOP's nominee for lieutenant governor in 2018; and Kathy Barnette, an author and Fox News contributor. They are hoping that the two front-runners tarnish each other enough that voters reject them both. Ms. Barnette, the Fox News commentator, says that is already happening.</p><p>\"They are spending a tremendous amount of money to sell a message, and they have yet to break out of the mid-20s\" in voter support in polls, said Ms. Barnette, who would be the first Black female Republican in the Senate.</p><p>The scant polling in the race shows Messrs. McCormick and Oz leading the field, but tentatively. Few polls show any candidate winning more than one-quarter of the vote, and several find that many voters are undecided.</p><p>More than 40% of Republicans had yet to pick a candidate in a recent Franklin &amp; Marshall College poll, and only a third said they were firmly decided. More GOP voters had an unfavorable view of Mr. Oz than a favorable view—39% to 27%. Mr. McCormick's image was more favorable than unfavorable, but half of voters said they didn't know enough to give an opinion.</p><p>In a debate Monday evening, the topic of attack ads was one of the first questions asked by moderators.</p><p>Mr. Oz said Mr. McCormick's ads were \"designed to try to fool the electorate\" and that Mr. Trump \"saw right through him and he therefore did not endorse Mr. McCormick.\"</p><p>Mr. McCormick, asked to respond to a TV attack ad claiming that he profited from business in China, said very little of his business dealings have been in China and that \"it's just disingenuous for Mehmet to say that.\"</p><p>Messrs. McCormick and Oz are aiming the largest volume of their ads at a strip of central Pennsylvania counties that runs from Harrisburg south to Lancaster and York, AdImpact data show. The region has the largest concentration of GOP primary voters other than metropolitan Philadelphia, and it is among the most conservative areas of the state.</p><p>While the candidates are introducing themselves in some upbeat ads, interviews with voters in the area suggest that the negative ads are resonating most.</p><p>\"I'll tell you one person I'd never vote for is Dave McCormick,\" said Ernest Greer, 74, a retired manufacturing worker in York County. \"He's a hedge-fund manager, and I think they ought to do away with hedge-fund managers, myself…They buy businesses, close it down and move jobs overseas.\"</p><p>Mr. Greer cited ads from the Oz campaign in which Mr. McCormick is shown praising China. \"His outfit did a lot of business in China…If he was the only choice, I wouldn't vote for U.S. senator.\"</p><p>TV ads and online posts gave Rob Greiner misgivings about Mr. Oz., even after Mr. Trump endorsed the physician earlier this month. \"My gut is telling me that he's been more leaning liberal for many years. It seems now he's making a switch,\" said Mr. Greiner, who backed both of Mr. Trump's presidential campaigns.</p><p>Mr. Greiner, 45, a security supervisor at a nuclear plant, said he feared Mr. Oz would turn into a \"Republican in name only\"—or RINO—\"and I'm not sure that's in Pennsylvania's best interests.'' Mr. Greer said the same of Mr. McCormick: \"He's a RINO-type Republican, and I can't stand them.\"</p><p>Republican state Sen. Mike Regan, whose district includes part of York County, said he was so unfamiliar with Mr. Oz before meeting him for coffee that he didn't recognize the candidate when he walked in the door. \"I was somehow picturing Dr. Phil,\" Mr. Regan said. Once he posted on Facebook that he had decided to endorse Mr. Oz, the comments posted in response quickly told him how much negative information was resonating with voters.</p><p>\"It was all, 'He's a RINO,' \" Mr. Regan said. \"It was right down the line of political-consultant negative ads.\"</p><p>For Mr. McCormick, Wall Street ties are a point of sensitivity. Connections to the finance sector have helped him raise significant sums: More than 60 employees of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. contributed to his campaign during the first quarter of 2022, FEC records show. Mr. McCormick is married to Goldman partner Dina Powell McCormick, a senior national security official in the Trump administration.</p><p>His backers also include hedge-fund billionaire Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel, who has given $7.5 million to a pro-McCormick super PAC that has spent more on TV ads on the race than any other entity. \"If we can get people like David McCormick to give up incredibly successful careers, in the peak of their careers, to go into public service, I'm just for people like that,\" Mr. Griffin said in a recent interview.</p><p>And yet several voters cited Mr. McCormick's hedge-fund background, as portrayed in negative TV ads, as a reason to treat his candidacy with caution. Mr. McCormick all but bypassed his leadership of Bridgewater while recounting his biography at a recent appearance in Lititz, a borough in Lancaster County. He introduced himself to voters as a high school and West Point wrestler—the sport is big in Western Pennsylvania—who became an Army Ranger and served in the first Gulf War. After stints as a software executive and in government \"I went on to another successful business\"—a reference to running the hedge fund.</p><p>Mr. Oz, for his part, has been working to rebut claims that his past statements show him sympathetic to some restrictions on guns and natural-gas fracking. \"And they are saying Mehmet is not a conservative? What a bunch of crap,\" said Ben Carson, the housing secretary under Mr. Trump, at an appearance Thursday with Mr. Oz.</p><p>Mr. Oz has been running TV ads touting his endorsement by Mr. Trump. Mr. McCormick has answered with an ad that shows him with a group of supportive motorcyclists, who hold up a Trump banner.</p><p>Write to Aaron Zitner at aaron.zitner@wsj.com and John McCormick at mccormick.john@wsj.com</p><p>It's 'Hollywood Liberal' vs. 'Wall Street Insider' in Pennsylvania Negative-Ad Fight</p>",
