The selloff in bonds helped push the German 10-year bund yield BX:TMBMKDE-10Yinto positive territory for the first time in three years.</p><p>“The market keeps focused on the tightening agenda of the Fed, and it is now pricing four interest rate increases for this year,” said Althea Spinozzi, senior fixed income strategist at Saxo Bank, in a note to clients.</p><p>She added that the focus Wednesday will be on a 20-year US Treasury auction, “a tenor not loved by investors. Weak demand could cause rates to go further up in the long part of the yield curve.”</p><p>The Fed is scheduled to meet next Tuesday and Wednesday, though many think January will be too soon to pencil in the first interest-rate hike. But “there's a very good chance that policy makers will indicate a hike is on the way when the QE program draws to a close in two months time,” said Matthew Ryan, senior market analyst at Ebury, in a note.</p><p>U.S. data ahead includes building permits and housing starts for December, due at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Investors will get earnings updates from Morgan Stanley MS, Bank of America BAC, UnitedHealth UNH and Procter &amp; Gamble PG ahead of the market's open. Disappointing results from Goldman Sachs GS on Tuesday also weighed on investor sentiment on Wednesday.</p><p>Crude oil prices CL00BRN00 were once again climbing, after reaching levels not seen since 2014 on Tuesday. Oil extended gains late in that session amid reports that an explosion disrupted flow through the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline between Iraq and Turkey.</p><p>On Wednesday, the International Energy Agency predicted global oil demand will exceed pre-pandemic levels this year due to increased vaccination against COVID-19 and milder recent waves of the virus.</p><p>West Texas Intermediate crude for February delivery CLG22 was last up 1.5% to $86.77 a barrel.</p><p>Read:RBC analyst says was wrong on Exxon as oil giant upgraded to sector perform</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>ASML Holding shares ASML rose more than 2% in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor-equipment maker reported better-than-forecast fourth-quarter earnings, predicted a 20% rise in sales this year and doubled its dividend to €5.50.</p><p>SoFi Technologies Inc. shares SOFI climbed 19% after the financial-technology group said that it won regulatory approval to become a bank holding company.</p><p>Shares of Zogenix Inc.
