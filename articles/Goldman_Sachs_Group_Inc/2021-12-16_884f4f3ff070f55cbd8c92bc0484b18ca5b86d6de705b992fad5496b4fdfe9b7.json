  "title": "Stocks Rise After Fed Rate Shift",
  "text": "<p>Stocks had pulled back this week as investors awaited the update from the central bank. Some investors said that uncertainty about the Fed's next moves, rather than unhappiness with the potential changes in monetary policy, may have weighed on stocks in recent sessions.</p><p>The market's reaction to the Federal Reserve's statement was \"almost like a sigh of relief,\" said Anu Gaggar, global investment strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network. \"It's like that uncertainty has been lifted.\"</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 gained 75.76 points, or 1.6%, to 4709.85, closing less than 0.1% away from a record. Ten of the U.S. stock benchmark's 11 sectors rose, while the energy group declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 383.25 points, or 1.1%, to 35927.43. The Nasdaq Composite climbed 327.94 points, or 2.2%, to 15565.58.</p><p>Accommodative monetary policy has helped propel U.S. indexes to dozens of records since the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic sent stocks swooning in early 2020. Low interest rates have made it easy for companies to borrow and pushed investors toward stocks.</p><p>Surging consumer prices have intensified the focus by Fed officials on curbing inflation, raising questions among investors about how quickly the central bank would pare back its asset purchases and lift its short-term benchmark rate. U.S. inflation hit a 39-year high in November, and producer prices jumped.</p><p>\"What's really coming in context is that inflation is hotter for longer than expected and the Fed is acknowledging it,\" said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank, before the Fed's afternoon announcement. \"There's also the view that new variants are not just a concern for growth, but a concern for inflation.\"</p><p>Oil prices ticked higher after the Fed statement, with global benchmark Brent crude adding 0.2%. The International Energy Agency said Tuesday it had reduced its forecast for 2022 energy demand, citing the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, and cut its supply outlook.</p><p>The emergence of the Omicron variant has injected volatility into markets in recent weeks as investors question whether their previous expectations for the economy still hold. The first large real-world study showed that the efficacy of two Pfizer Inc. shots declined against the strain, both for infection and hospitalization. The variant accounts for about 3% of cases in the U.S.</p><p>\"Our view is that Omicron passes,\" said Alex Chaloff, co-head of investment strategies at Bernstein Private Wealth Management. \"It's more worrisome that there continue to be these mutations and new strains.\"</p><p>In new economic data, retail sales rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in November, slowing from October's pace. Economists had predicted an 0.8% increase amid the holiday shopping season.</p><p>U.S. government bond yields rose, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbing to 1.460% from 1.437% Tuesday. Yields rise as bond prices fall.</p><p>Among individual stocks, Eli Lilly shares climbed $25.90, or 10%, to $275.28 after the pharmaceutical company raised its full-year guidance.</p><p>Shares of chemical company Albemarle fell $4.04, or 1.7%, to $239.79 after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the stock.</p><p>Bitcoin climbed along with stocks. At 5 p.m. New York time, it traded at $49,221.12, up 1.95% from Tuesday, according to CoinDesk.</p><p>The dollar fell against the euro and British pound but rose against the Japanese yen. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against rival currencies, fell 0.2%.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.3%. Early Thursday, Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average was up 1.6%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 0.6% and Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 was down 0.6%. S&amp;P 500 stock futures were down 0.1%.</p>",
