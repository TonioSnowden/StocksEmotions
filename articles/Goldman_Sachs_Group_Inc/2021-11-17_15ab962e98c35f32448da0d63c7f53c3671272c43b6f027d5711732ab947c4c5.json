On Tuesday, the investment committee for Mass PRIM, as the $98.5 billion system is known, approved a recommendation that would let its staff commit up to 40% of its annual private-equity allocation to co-investments.</p><p>Oaktree Capital Management has closed its largest fund to date, gathering $15.9 billion to invest in troubled industries and credit-constrained companies, Chris Cumming reports for WSJ Pro Private Equity.

Panelists at the Milken Institute's Asia Summit in Singapore singled out several of these as return drivers, including backing crossover funds, which invest in private firms and then hold their positions following public listings. The discussion also focused on backing private-equity fund managers and investing in sustainable businesses as ways to improve returns.</p><p>The board of the nation's largest pension fund voted Monday to use borrowed money and alternative assets to meet its investment-return target, even after lowering that target just a few months ago, Heather Gillers writes for The Wall Street Journal. The $495 billion California Public Employees' Retirement System raised its allocation target for private equity to 13% from 8% and added a 5% allocation to private debt. The moves reflect the dimming prospects for relatively safe publicly traded investments by households and institutions alike and sets a tone for increased risk-taking by pension funds around the country.</p><p>Upcoming Pro Event</p><p>WSJ Pro is hosting the Sustainable Business Forum on November 17.
