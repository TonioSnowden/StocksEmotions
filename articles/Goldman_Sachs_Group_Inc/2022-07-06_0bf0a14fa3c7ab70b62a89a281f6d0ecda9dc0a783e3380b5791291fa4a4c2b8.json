Analysts said technical factors were also at play, with crude futures sliding through key support levels.</p><p>In a note Wednesday, analysts at Sevens Report Research, said \"WTI materially violated the uptrend line dating back to the beginning of the year when Russia first invaded Ukraine, which prompted the surge beyond $100/barrel mark.\"</p><p>The early May closing low of $99.43 should be viewed as a \"near-term line in the sand as if it is broken, downside momentum could continue to build,\" they wrote, adding that Tuesday's trend bread hadn't yet shifted the outlook to bearish \"but it did shift our outlook from bullish to neutral on a short- to medium-term time frame, with rangebound trading in the upper $90s to $115/ barrel area becoming increasingly likely.\"</p><p>In related news Wednesday, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries announced the passing of Mohammad Barkindo, the group's \"much-loved\" secretary general since 2016.</p><p>From an oil viewpoint, \"we don't expect much change from this,\" as he was due to leave his position at the end of the month, said Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at The Price Futures Group.</p><p>See: OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo dies</p><p>Meanwhile, oil supply data from the Energy Information Administration will be delayed to Thursday due to Monday's holiday.</p><p>On average, analysts polled by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights expect the EIA to report a fall of 1.2 million in U.S. crude supplies for the week ended July 1, along with an inventory decline of 500,000 barrels for gasoline and increase of 1 million barrels for distillates.</p><p>European natural-gas prices fell sharplyon Wednesday, after a strike by Norwegian oil and gas workers that threatened to further pressure a market already under significant strain from Russia's war in Ukraine was called off.</p><p>U.S. oil prices dip into a bear market</p>",
