  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start: Everton Football Club</strong> is in talks to secure new financing after suspending sponsorships with companies connected to sanctioned Russian billionaire <strong>Alisher Usmanov</strong>, people with knowledge of the matter <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/725912a4-b4d8-4d45-8ce5-740a81572734?\">told the FT's Samuel Agini</a>.</p> <h2>Cake and conspiracy: the 1MDB trial barrels on</h2> <p><strong>Tim Leissner</strong> “wanted to be a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f27d719-19e5-4949-93ad-5de742242476\">hero at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong></a>”, he said in a Manhattan courtroom last week. </p> <p>When a prosecutor asked the former banker what fate he hopes to receive now, he responded: “I hope I don't have to go to prison, sir.”</p> <p>The same stunning reversal in ambition also applies to <strong>Roger Ng</strong>, the ex-Goldman banker who was once Leissner's subordinate and is on trial for fraud over Malaysia's <strong>1MDB </strong>scandal.</p> <p>For DD readers needing a refresh on the multibillion-dollar pillage of the Malaysian state investment fund, we broke down the saga <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d144764c-42f4-4f56-aadb-2e86d1bfa114\">here</a>. Goldman has said it was lied to by Malaysian officials and 1MDB, while Leissner has testified to lying to the bank during its internal review of 1MDB transactions.</p> <p>A lot has happened since then. Ng, Goldman's former head of investment banking in Malaysia, is on trial for conspiring to launder money and violate an anti-bribery law, charges for which he pled not guilty.</p> <p>US prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d12b19ad-9c0b-4ebc-8598-f936862c0044\">claim</a> he received more than $35mn in funds misappropriated from the 1MDB fund for his role in bribing officials and moving stolen money to offshore bank accounts. <strong>Marc Agnifilo</strong>, Ng's lawyer, said the banker had “nothing to do” with the $35mn payment.</p> <p>They've also accused Ng of cultivating close ties to Malaysian financier <strong>Jho Low</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/827d5727-3cf7-4881-8925-ca8812628539\">alleged mastermind</a> behind the fraud who remains at large and denies wrongdoing. Agnifilo has sought to focus on Leissner's own relationship with the financier, which continued after the banker left Goldman.</p> <p>Both men face significant prison time — up to 30 years for Ng and up to 25 for Leissner, who has agreed to co-operate with the US government in the hope of receiving a lesser sentence. </p> <p>The former Goldman south-east Asia chair has already pleaded guilty for his role in the conspiracy. He's admitted to spending his roughly $60mn share of the stolen proceeds on luxuries including a 170ft yacht and investments in Italian football team <strong>Inter Milan</strong>.</p> <p>His testimony now<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/829f619d-7a9c-4c4b-9e1d-82ee8706e085\"> threatens to drag</a> down Ng — along with Malaysian politicians and Abu Dhabi government officials.</p> <p>One interesting titbit: the two used code words on<strong> BlackBerry</strong> messenger while concocting the scheme, Leissner alleged, using “cakes” to refer to money owed to the “bakery” — aka those who were promised bribes.</p> <p>But Leissner hasn't proved himself to be particularly trustworthy, something Ng's lawyers have latched on to throughout his account of events.</p> <p>The defence attempted to poke multiple holes in Leissner's story, such as his version of a meeting with Low, Ng and others during which the two discussed receiving potential kickbacks. The problem, according to Ng's attorney: Leissner had booked a flight to Hong Kong that night.</p> <p>Leissner's personal life is just as tangled. He testified to Photoshopping divorce papers so he could marry his now-estranged wife, former model <strong>Kimora Lee Simmons</strong>, and to being temporarily engaged to the niece of a Malaysian state's chief minister while married to another woman.</p> <p>Now Leissner, <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Finance/A-rare-cunning-liar-1MDB-trial-weighs-ex-Goldman-star-s-credibility\">deemed by</a> the defence as “a rare, cunning liar”, insists that it's “time to do the right thing”.&#xa0;</p> <p>With at least two more weeks of the trial to go, Ng's future could depend on whether his former boss can convince the jury that he has finally chosen the righteous path.</p> <h2>AMC strikes gold</h2> <p>Of the myriad strange things that DD didn't expect to happen this year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cc442a9-28da-4bcd-88a2-fda1404f0ef6\">meme-ified cinema chain</a> <strong>AMC Entertainment</strong> taking a stake in a gold mine would have been pretty high on the list.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the cinema chain took a step <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef488b74-db73-478c-99b9-717c4f2db9b4\">in an unexpected direction</a>, buying a 22 per cent stake in Nevada-based miner <strong>Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation</strong>.</p> <p>The surprising link between both parties is Hycroft's largest shareholder, the New York-based hedge fund <strong>Mudrick Capital</strong>.</p> <p>Mudrick lent hundreds of millions of dollars to AMC and also netted a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c561ec52-25b4-4700-8d3f-56c002a46a86\">quick profit</a> from buying and rapidly selling its shares last summer. </p> <p>It also had a role in Hycroft's tumultuous history. The mining company fell into bankruptcy in 2015, emerged later that year, and then went public via a merger with a Spac launched by Mudrick's founder <strong>Jason Mudrick </strong>during the peak of the blank-cheque boom in June 2020.</p> <p>AMC is spending $27.9mn for 22 per cent of Hycroft — an investment matched by billionaire metals investor<strong> Eric Sprott</strong>. As part of the financing, Hycroft also has a deal with <strong>Sprott Resource Lending</strong>, the investor's private lending arm, to roll up its principal debt into a single payment due in 2027.</p> <p>The odd deal could be the beginning of a greater foray by AMC into meme-stock companies.</p> <p>Chief executive <strong>Adam Aron</strong> acknowledged the strangeness of the transaction: “To state the obvious, one would not normally think that a movie theatre company's core competency includes gold or silver mining.”&#xa0;</p> <p>He added that AMC's “enormous success . . . as well as communicating with individual retail investors” are skills that will be used to help Hycroft boost its share price.</p> <p>The tactic appears to be working. Hycroft's shares jumped 13 per cent while AMC's rose 7 per cent. </p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43cad2e0-133a-452b-9d7b-95574287128f?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">Lex</a> notes, the hype may be enough for the Redditors. Day-traders boasting of “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4916c465-99ec-46f4-a889-df845ad1bcd2\">diamond hands</a>” have suddenly found themselves holding gold and silver too. </p> <h2>UniCredit's dealmaking strategy takes another hit</h2> <p>Less than 12 months ago, DD might've put money on <strong>Andrea Orcel</strong> to lift Italy's <strong>UniCredit</strong> out of its rut.</p> <p>When he took the helm of the Italian lender in April 2021, the kick-boxing banker had the support of UniCredit's politically fraught board on his side — which had previously clashed with his predecessor <strong>Jean Pierre Mustier</strong>. </p> <p>But Orcel has been dealt a one-two punch that has put him on the defensive. </p> <p>His first order of business to orchestrate a takeover of Italy's<strong> Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5446c2f2-4fed-4894-bf7f-7b1b884e9607\">crumbled in October</a>. More recently, the war in Ukraine has foiled UniCredit's attempt to buy <strong>Otkritie</strong> — a Russian bank now subject to western sanctions — and further weighed on its shares.</p> <p>Prospects for a rumoured takeover of smaller Italian lender<strong> Banco BPM</strong> — in line with UniCredit's domestic M&amp;A strategy — are looking grim, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/878037e0-1fea-4db5-b0fe-6b454e235d94\">as Lex noted</a>.</p> <p>On Monday, Orcel announced that he's pondering an exit from Russia, in line with rivals <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>, Goldman and <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>, after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fae7d5b7-112b-4b41-931c-e53643ab4d36\">warning</a> it could lose up to €7bn should its Russian business be wiped out in an “extreme scenario”.</p> <p>Looks like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5da35450-cc8c-402f-93d9-3e381ea396ad\">the boisterous Orcel</a> could be in for his biggest fight yet.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> <a href=\"https://investegate.co.uk/glaxosmithkline-plc--gsk-/rns/appointments-to-designate-haleon-board/202203151000028160E/\">has appointed</a> six directors to the board of its new consumer health division <strong>Haleon</strong>, which is about to be spun off from its parent company.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Credit Suisse </strong>has named<strong> Rob Cox</strong>, the global editor of<strong> Reuters</strong>' Breakingviews, as group head of corporate communications.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Andreessen Horowitz</strong> has hired former federal prosecutor <strong>Michele Korver </strong>as its new regulatory head.
