  "title": "Pro Bankruptcy Briefing: Aeromexico to Exit Chapter 11; Latam Creditor Deals Approved; Evergrande Faces Forced Sale of Land",
  "text": "<p>Aeromexico cleared to leave chapter 11. A bankruptcy judge in New York said on Friday that she would confirm Grupo Aeromexico SA B de CV's proposed reorganization plan after the company reached settlements with two groups of creditors. The restructuring plan will make Apollo Global Management Inc. the airline's largest shareholder and preserve a 20% stake for Delta Air Lines Inc., a key business partner of Aeromexico. Court approval came after Aeromexico settled with two groups of creditors that had argued they were being treated unfairly compared with others that are financing the company's exit from chapter 11.</p><p>Latam approved for $1.55 billion deal with plan sponsors. The judge overseeing Latam Airlines Group SA's bankruptcy approved settlements worth nearly $1.55 billion with three investment funds that are seeking to sponsor its exit from chapter 11, ruling against other unsecured creditors. The agreements cover disputes over aircraft leases that the creditor funds purchased on the secondary market, court papers show. The creditors' claims of $850 million and $695 million, respectively, are being allowed against Latam, despite objections from the official committee of Latam's unsecured creditors as well as a trustee for Chilean bondholders.</p><p>Evergrande faces forced sale of Hong Kong land it pledged for loan. Receivers have been appointed over land in Hong Kong that China Evergrande Group used as collateral for a $520 million loan, but the sale of the plot won't affect the company's broader restructuring, the troubled developer said. Evergrande was notified on Wednesday about the move, which relates to a plot of undeveloped residential land located in Yuen Long, the property company said in a filing late Sunday in Hong Kong. It didn't name the lender. The creditor is Los Angeles-based distressed-debt manager Oaktree Capital, which used the land as collateral for a secured loan it extended to Evergrande, a person familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Distress</p><p>Credito Real seeks emergency loan. Mexico's largest non-bank lender Credito Real SAB de CV is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to arrange rescue financing to pay down its bonds due next month. The company asked the bank for potential sources of new financing secured by the company's assets to cover the coming maturity on a 170 million Swiss franc ($180 million) note and avoid default, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Long considered an investor favorite, the company's bonds have lately fallen out of favor, declining by as much as a third from their trading levels a few months ago, when they were valued close to 99 cents on the dollar. Fitch Ratings and S&amp;P Global Ratings also downgraded Credito Real earlier this week by three and two notches, respectively, citing the company's dwindling liquidity and the coming maturity of the Swiss franc-denominated bond.</p><p>Bankruptcy</p><p>Purdue, Sacklers appeals case begins in April. An appeals court in Manhattan is scheduled to hear aurgements over Purdue Pharma LP's bid to reinstate a $4.5 billion settlement the bankrupt drugmaker reached with its owners from the Sackler family. The hearing will be held during the week of April 25 on an expedited basis as the appeals court considers legal protections shiedling Sackler family members from civil opioid suits. Purdue's bankruptcy plan and related settlement with the Sacklers was voided last year by a federal judge after a handful of state attorneys general and the Justice Department's bankruptcy watchdog challenged it. — Jonathan Randles</p><p>Economy</p><p>Stock-market jitters don't endanger economy just yet. The past few weeks of stock market turmoil don't mean the economy is about to be derailed, but rather that the recovery is maturing and no longer needs low interest rates, economists and Federal Reserve officials say.</p><p>Meanwhile Bank of America has shifted its outlook for monetary policy in a decidedly hawkish direction and now expects more rate rises this year than even the most aggressive forecast from a central banker.</p><p>\"We feel like the communications we have with market participants and with the general public are working and that financial conditions are reflecting in advance the decisions that we make.\"</p><p>— Jerome Powell</p><p>Markets</p><p>Investors sour on muni funds. Waning interest in muni debt in 2022 marks a reversal from 2021 when investors poured money into muni bond funds as federal stimulus and a bustling economy bolstered state and local government credit. That trend drove down the cost of school construction, sewers and other capital projects but now those expenses are rising.</p><p>Consumers</p><p>New York eviction ban ends, but tenants find ways to stay in homes. Some pandemic safeguards and local laws have delayed evictions for many of the state's delinquent tenants, as they have in a number of cities across the country. Tenant attorneys across the state are also filing a flurry of new court motions to try to fend off evictions or to buy tenants more time.</p><p>But those procedures and protections can only temporarily delay the eviction process. Many renters owe five-figure sums. Some New York lawmakers and housing advocates say that unless tenants get access to additional rental-assistance funds, a wave of evictions looks inevitable.</p><p>International</p><p>Argentina, IMF restructure $44 billion bailout. Argentine President Alberto Fernández said Friday that his government reached a deal with the International Monetary Fund to restructure a $44 billion bailout that would help the South American country avert a debt default and currency meltdown after being locked out of global financial markets. The IMF's bailout was the biggest in the fund's history, and the 22nd it provided to Argentina. Latin America's third-biggest economy has inched from one financial crisis to another over the past 70 years as a result of excessive public spending and unsustainable debt, economists say.</p><p>In Other News</p><p>SPAC-backed Rehab provider ATI Physical Therapy is seeking fresh capital and working with lenders to address debt maturity.
