  "text": "<p>Away From Bugatti</p><p>Volkswagen AG is selling the Bugatti hypercar business to create a new company jointly owned by the Croatian electric car startup Rimac Automobili and VW's sports car unit Porsche AG, as the auto industry's pivot to electric vehicles transforms the elite world of super high-performance sports cars.</p><p>The deal marks the end of an era for Bugatti, one of the most recognizable names in the world of super luxury vehicles, after two decades spent under ownership of the German auto giant, which is now shifting to electric vehicles.</p><p>Rimac will be the majority shareholder with a stake of 55% in the joint venture, while Porsche holds the rest and will also retain its 24% stake that it holds in Rimac directly. The venture is expected to be officially launched in the fourth quarter of this year and will be based in Zagreb.</p><p>-- William Boston</p><p>---</p><p>GLENCORE</p><p>Tony Hayward to</p><p>Retire as Chairman</p><p>Tony Hayward, who stepped down leading BP PLC in the wake of the fatal Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, is retiring as chairman of Glencore PLC, the commodities giant he presided over for eight years.</p><p>Mr. Hayward's departure was expected and comes after his tenure had been extended beyond that typical of a U.K. chairperson, as Glencore's board looked for a new CEO and managed a succession of regulatory probes.</p><p>The retirement of Mr. Hayward completes a changing of the guard at Glencore. Longtime Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg stepped down last week and was succeeded by Gary Nagle, who was previously a senior executive at the company.</p><p>Mr. Hayward will be succeeded at the end of the month by veteran mining executive Kalidas Madhavpeddi, Glencore said Monday.</p><p>Mr. Hayward oversaw Glencore's response to a series of major international regulatory investigations that have bedeviled the commodities trading and mining group, putting pressure on its share price.</p><p>-- Alistair MacDonald</p><p>---</p><p>CREDIT SUISSE GROUP</p><p>Swiss Bank Hires</p><p>Goldman Tech Officer</p><p>Credit Suisse Group AG hired a top technology executive from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the latest revamp to the Swiss bank's management team in the wake of twin scandals.</p><p>Joanne Hannaford will become the bank's new chief technology officer and chief operating officer, replacing James Walker in the COO role. Mr. Walker will become deputy chief executive officer at Credit Suisse's U.S. holding company, the bank said.</p><p>Credit Suisse reeled from a $5 billion-plus loss from family office Archegos Capital Management this spring, and its reputation also took a hit from the March bankruptcy of a financing partner, Greensill Capital. The bank ousted several executives, including two members of its management team. New Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio started reviews into risk management, strategy and culture via a board committee and outside consultants.</p><p>Mrs. Hannaford held senior engineering roles at Goldman Sachs over a 24-year career at the bank in London and New York. Goldman made her a partner in 2014. She will start Jan. 1.</p><p>A Goldman Sachs spokesperson declined to comment.</p><p>-- Margot Patrick</p>",
