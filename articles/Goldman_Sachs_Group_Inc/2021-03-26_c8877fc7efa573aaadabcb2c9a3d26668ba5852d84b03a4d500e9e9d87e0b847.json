  "text": "<p>The Federal Reserve is <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210325a.htm\">preparing to</a> do away with Covid-19-era restrictions on bank dividends and buybacks. US banks that clear the next round of stress tests with sufficient capital will be allowed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7c36b73-ea8b-4fff-a4bc-27353296ecf4\">resume dividend increases</a> at the end of June. The current cap on stock buybacks will also be lifted. </p> <p>For banks awash in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73177be1-71cf-4e31-9590-a296a2ba16c7\">excess capital</a> this could spur vast payouts. Bank of America calculates that large banks could return as much as 10 per cent of their market cap in buybacks and dividends between the fourth quarter of this year and the third quarter of 2022.</p> <p>But if banks are serious about getting back in investor good books they should eschew large buybacks. This would signal confidence in their ability to generate cash through the recovery cycle.&#xa0;</p> <p>Pre-pandemic, share buybacks have been Wall Street's preferred route of returning capital to shareholders. Unlike dividends paid at regular intervals, management can decide for themselves on the best time to buy stock. They also help to boost earnings per share — a key determinant of executive pay — by reducing outstanding shares. Citigroup, for example, bought back nearly $18bn of its shares in 2019, more than three times the sum paid out in dividends.</p> <p>Companies like to justify buybacks in terms of discipline and confidence. Yet the moment when companies have plenty of spare cash tends to coincide with rising share prices, making it an expensive exercise. </p> <p>The KBW Bank index is up more than a fifth this year and has rallied more than 70 per cent over the past 12 months. Shares in JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs both reached new highs this month. With the exception of Citigroup and Wells Fargo, the six biggest US banks all trade well above book value.</p> <p>This should continue as the US economy bounces back and rising interest rates boost lending margins. If loan demand recovers banks would be better off putting their excess capital to work than splashing out on mega buybacks. <br></p><p>Source:  2021 'US banks: don't get excited about buybacks just yet' FT.com 26 March.
