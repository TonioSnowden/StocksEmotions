  "text": "<p>The U.S. and European economies slowed sharply in June as surging prices of energy and food weakened demand for other goods and services, surveys last week showed, underlining how gloomy the outlook has become as Russia's war in Ukraine saps global growth and high inflation prompts central banks to jack up interest rates.</p><p>For China, that pullback in overseas spending means that it can't rely on exports to propel a robust rebound from its lockdown-induced doldrums, as it did after the initial outbreak in early 2020.</p><p>Instead, Beijing is banking this time on an infrastructure splurge to power its economy. China's cabinet, known as the State Council, on Thursday announced plans to borrow 300 billion yuan, equivalent to $44.8 billion, to help finance major infrastructure projects. Local governments have already borrowed 3.4 trillion yuan to finance infrastructure investment so far this year, according to Goldman Sachs.</p><p>Many economists, though, are doubtful that big investments will be enough to offset a sinking real-estate market and subdued consumer and business confidence.</p><p>Urban unemployment was 5.9% in May, higher than the government's target of 5.5% or lower, while joblessness among those age 16 to 24 rose to a high of 18.4%.</p><p>China's official purchasing managers index for nonmanufacturing sectors posted a reading of 54.7 in June, a big jump from the previous month's 47.8, the National Bureau of Statistics said Thursday.</p><p>The surge was led by a rebound in construction and the services sector, where the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions unclogged transportation blockages and allowed people to return to stores and restaurants.</p><p>The reading was the highest since May last year, survey data shows, and follows three straight months of declines as lockdowns blanketed major cities such as Shenzhen and Shanghai. A reading above 50 indicates activity is expanding rather than shrinking.</p><p>Manufacturing activity returned to growth, but the rebound was weaker than economists were anticipating. The purchasing managers index for the manufacturing sector notched up a reading of 50.2, higher than the previous month's 49.6, but lower than the 50.5 reading expected by analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Overall production rose, but new export orders were weak, the survey showed, highlighting fading global demand.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
