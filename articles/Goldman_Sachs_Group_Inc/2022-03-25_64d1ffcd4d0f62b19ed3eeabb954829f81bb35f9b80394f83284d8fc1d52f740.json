  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start: </strong>An investor group led by <strong>Los Angeles Dodgers </strong>owner<strong> Todd Boehly</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85584dae-10db-44dd-a922-e94047ce8606\">is going head-to-head</a> with another led by private equity billionaires <strong>Josh Harris</strong> and <strong>David Blitzer </strong>in the £3bn race to buy <strong>Chelsea Football Club</strong>, said people with knowledge of the matter.</p> <h2>Advisers think twice about Pamplona</h2> <p>Eighteen years ago <strong>Alex Knaster</strong>, a Moscow-born, <strong>Harvard</strong>-educated banker who ran Russia's <strong>Alfa-Bank</strong> in the late 1990s and early 2000s, founded <strong>Pamplona Capital Management</strong>.</p> <p>Since then, the private equity and hedge fund business has grown to about $9bn under management, boasting ties with blue-chip advisers and based at one of London's swankiest addresses, just yards from The Dorchester hotel on Park Lane. </p> <p>But it has a problem. At least four-fifths of its firepower comes from <strong>LetterOne</strong>, the investment vehicle in which <strong>Mikhail Fridman</strong>, <strong>Petr Aven</strong> and <strong>German Khan </strong>own stakes, DD's Kaye Wiggins and Antoine Gara <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/8a63e341-4747-4019-92bc-9286b7516668\">report</a>. The three were sanctioned following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. </p> <p>LetterOne isn't sanctioned and Pamplona is “free to continue its day-to-day operations”, the private equity group said, adding: “Any suggestion that Pamplona is at risk of being sanctioned is entirely incorrect.”</p> <p>Still, it raises difficult questions for those blue-chip advisers. <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>and <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> have paused new business with Pamplona while<strong> UBS</strong>,<strong> Houlihan Lokey</strong> and <strong>Nomura </strong>are taking legal advice about dealing with the private equity group. </p> <p>It's a sign of how years of ties between Russian cash and the City of London have left bankers and lawyers scrambling to understand how to deal with entities that are not sanctioned but are linked to people who are. </p> <p><strong>Waystone</strong>, a Cayman Islands firm that provides directors for private funds in the tax haven, resigned from all of its roles in relation to Pamplona funds on March 4 — days after the EU <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1837a20-6147-45c5-876c-add96ee8432c\">sanctioned</a> Fridman and Aven. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Pamplona faces a huge task. It said it would hand back LetterOne's money and wind down three funds, which could be done by selling LetterOne's stakes or the companies that Pamplona had bought. </p> <p>Another company facing issues: UK healthcare retailer <strong>Holland &amp; Barrett</strong>, which is owned by LetterOne and similarly is not subject to sanctions, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e3cb5bd-ce3f-4da6-b033-f50a5df8ab78\">struggling to make</a> a scheduled interest payment to its lenders because a bank is having issues processing the transaction. </p> <h2>The chaos deepens at Toshiba</h2> <p>Nervous phone calls and tallying votes from hedge funds and other investors went on until late into Wednesday night at <strong>Toshiba</strong>, ahead of a cliffhanger vote that could have led to one of Japan's most prominent conglomerates compelled to reopen talks with circling private equity buyers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8083091c-f8b3-41d3-a4f5-0da8af803cb1\">It didn't happen</a>.</p> <p>Instead, shareholders voted against two proposals — one by management and another by Toshiba's second-largest shareholder, the highly secretive hedge fund<strong> 3D Investment Partners</strong>.</p> <p>3D had suggested reopening take-private talks but was defeated at an extraordinary general meeting, despite backing from a proxy advisory firm, several hedge funds and even one external board member. </p> <p>The potential private equity sale had been agitated for by other major Toshiba investors including Singaporean fund <strong>Effissimo</strong> and the US fund <strong>Farallon Capital</strong>. </p> <p>The Japanese conglomerate's more optimistic investors had hoped that a victory for the Singapore-based activist would mark the end of a tumultuous era for Toshiba, which has led to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e7ce077-7ae2-4551-a5fd-5e9e6093db8a\">forced resignations</a> of two chief executives and raised the possibility of the company being taken private in what would have been the country's largest-ever buyout.</p> <p>A proposal by management to hive off the company's devices business and split the conglomerate in two was also rejected by shareholders, leaving investors and executives in a stalemate.</p> <p>The meeting was punctuated by questions from embittered shareholders and bewildered former factory workers who complained that management has turned their back on them in favour of overseas hedge funds.</p> <p>However, some investors told our colleagues in Japan that the stand-off could be a good thing as it could allow Toshiba's chief to offer up some radical ideas.</p> <p>With neither management nor investors getting their say, it's now back to the drawing board for the 146-year-old conglomerate and its new chief <strong>Taro Shimada</strong>. He has three months until the company's AGM to revamp the strategy or again try to convince investors about one of the options defeated this week. </p> <p>The former <strong>Siemens</strong> executive, who joined Toshiba three years ago and has overseen its digital transformation has said little publicly about the proposals. Investors say that he has shown his support for the take-private option behind closed doors. Given that this week's meeting was more a temperature-taking exercise than a legally binding vote, the take-private option could return to the table once again. </p> <h2>Another oligarch-linked property mystery</h2> <p>Last week DD dug into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f4685ef-3e8a-420f-928d-a3a479f94813\">the mystery of Sutton Place</a>, the centuries-old Tudor mansion in Surrey that could very well belong to Uzbekistan-born Russian multi-billionaire <strong>Alisher Usmanov</strong>.</p> <p>But it's not the only property enigma surrounding the sanctioned oligarch, as DD's Rob Smith and the FT's Cynthia O'Murchu, George Hammond and Samuel Agini <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/8d620d96-4859-464d-9050-f770a7d6604a?\">reveal</a>.</p> <p>Earlier this month, real estate services company <strong>CBRE </strong>began marketing Liverpool's<strong> Royal Liver Building </strong>to potential buyers for about £90mn.</p> <p>It is working on behalf of a group of investors who acquired the building for £48mn in 2017, of which the largest stakeholder is<strong> Everton Football Club </strong>owner <strong>Farhad Moshiri</strong>. </p> <p>The British-Iranian businessman owns 49.9 per cent of the property, the FT discovered, despite the fact that CBRE had marketed the sale on behalf of <strong>Corestate Capital</strong>, a property investment group that only owns 35 per cent of the building.</p> <p>Even more curiously, the building was put up for sale just days after Usmanov, a longtime associate of Moshiri's, was <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-announces-sanctions-against-russian-oligarchs-alisher-usmanov-and-igor-shuvalov\">sanctioned by the UK</a>. </p> <p>As the FT revealed earlier this month, Everton's finances have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/725912a4-b4d8-4d45-8ce5-740a81572734\">taken a hit</a> from the economic retaliation against Usmanov. The club is currently on the hunt for new sponsors after cutting ties with <strong>USM Holdings</strong> (of which Moshiri is a shareholder) and other companies tied to Moshiri's former Russian associate.</p> <p>Everton also happens to be one of the Royal Liver Building's tenants, with sales documents sent to prospective buyers showing that the club accounts for 14 per cent of the building's letting income. </p> <p>Moshiri has been coming under increasing scrutiny over his relationship with Usmanov. Earlier this week, the BBC<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60825983\"> reported</a> that he served as a link between Usmanov and a number of luxury properties including the Sutton Place mansion. &#xa0;</p> <p>Moshiri's spokesperson denied this, telling the BBC that he “has never been nor is he now involved in the management and/or control of the Sutton Place Property Unit Trust”.</p> <p>Questions hanging over both Sutton Place and the Royal Liver Building underscore the deeply convoluted ownership structures that have made the UK a preferred destination for billionaires to park their cash discreetly.</p> <p>Usmanov is well versed in the practice. A spokesperson for the industrialist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/alisher-usmanov-ex-arsenal-shareholder-russian-bilionaire-assets-sanctions\">claimed to The Guardian on Tuesday</a> that most of the billionaire's UK properties and his yacht had been “long ago transferred into irrevocable trusts”.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-24/morgan-stanley-taps-blanchard-to-replace-passi-in-syndicate-role?srnd=premium&amp;sref=OziMsGoK\">has replaced</a><strong> Pawan Passi</strong>, the head of its Americas equities syndicate who was put on leave amid <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d14c8bf-d6fd-4cb0-b654-9dfdc4254bc1\">twin probes</a> into the bank's block trading business, with <strong>Arnaud Blanchard</strong>, the chief operating officer of its global capital markets business, per Bloomberg.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Roger Barron</strong>, <strong>Paul Hastings</strong>' global vice-chair of M&amp;A based in London, is leaving the firm to enter private practice.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Unilever </strong>veteran <strong>Isabelle Esser </strong>has joined the board of <strong>Tate &amp; Lyle</strong> as a non-executive director. She will also begin the role of chief research innovation and food quality safety officer at <strong>Danone</strong> next month.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Oil and oligarchs </strong>BP helped pull back the iron curtain during the fall of the Soviet Union, leading the western gold rush into one of the world's most resource-rich economies, as chronicled in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9238fa2-65a2-4753-a845-ce8129f93a0c\">this FT Big Read</a>.</p> <p><strong>Racist real estate</strong> US home values have soared in the nation's most affluent enclaves during the pandemic.
