  "text": "<p>Top News</p><p>Covid-19 Delta Variant Pummels China's Services Sector</p><p>China's official nonmanufacturing purchasing managers index, which tracks activity in the construction and services sectors, plummeted to 47.5 in August, from 53.3 the prior month, according to data released Tuesday by the National Bureau of Statistics, breaking through the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction. The 47.5 reading—which fell well short of economists' forecasts for a reading comfortably above 50—marks the measure's first dip into contractionary territory since February 2020, at the height of the initial explosion of the coronavirus, which led to the lockdown of the province of Hubei.</p><p>Derby's Take: Funds Rate Softens, Raising Specter of Technical Rate Boost</p><p>By Michael S. Derby</p><p>Since around mid-August, the effective federal-funds rate has started to slide after having been firmed up earlier in the summer following a technical rate increase from the Fed. The funds rate, having hung around 0.10% for most of the summer, ticked down to 0.9% on Aug. 18, and ticked down again to 0.8% on Monday. If the funds rate stays soft or gets softer and that shift proves persistent, the Fed may have to react by lifting again the settings of its rate-control tool kit.

The investment bank estimates that between 2.5 million and 3.5 million households are behind on rent and owe landlords as much as $17 billion, amid a slow pace of government aid to renters. \"The strength of the housing and rental market suggests landlords will try to evict tenants who are delinquent on rent unless they obtain federal assistance,\" the note says. That may not have much of a negative effect on the national economy, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. They say in the note that \"Our literature review indicates a small drag on consumption and job growth from an eviction episode of this magnitude.\"</p><p>—Michael S.
