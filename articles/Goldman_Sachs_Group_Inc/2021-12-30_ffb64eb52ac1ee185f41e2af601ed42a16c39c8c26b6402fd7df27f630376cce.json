  "text": "<p>   Shares of Victoria's Secret &amp; Co. soared Wednesday after the lingerie seller said it plans to buy back $250 million of its own shares and reported strong sales growth during the holidays. </p><p>   Shares rose as much as 15% before closing up 12% at $54.50. </p><p>   The company said it will purchase its stock through an accelerated share-repurchase program with Goldman Sachs. Victoria's Secret will receive 4.1 million shares on Dec. 31, and the company said the program would close by the end of the first quarter of 2022. </p><p>   Victoria's Secret has been working to turnaround its image, relying less on supermodels in ads and including more models with diverse body shapes. The company has made other tweaks: bringing back its swimwear business in addition to selling maternity bras and shapewear. </p><p>   In August, the company spun off from L Brands and started trading as a stand-alone company. </p><p>   Victoria's Secret Chief Executive Martin Waters said Wednesday the company had strong sales growth during the Thanksgiving shopping weekend and a \"rush of business\" as it got closer to Christmas. </p><p>   The company, which has around 1,400 stores world-wide, stuck with its previous estimate that sales in its fourth quarter will either rise as much as 3% from the same quarter a year ago, or remain flat. </p><p></p>",
