  "title": "SumUp struggles to €8bn valuation as tech sell-off hits UK fintech",
  "text": "<p>SumUp has become the latest European fintech to be hit by a global sell-off in technology companies, after the London-based start-up raised funds giving it a valuation of €8bn (£6.9bn), less than half the price tag suggested for the group earlier this year.</p> <p>SumUp, which provides payments services for small merchants, said on Thursday it had raised €590mn split evenly between debt and equity at an enterprise value of €8bn. However, in January <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-26/payments-firm-sumup-said-to-seek-new-funds-at-22-billion-value\">it was reported</a> that SumUp was targeting a value as high as €20bn, which would have made it one of the UK's most valuable start-ups.</p> <p>Marc-Alexander Christ, chief executive of SumUp, said that he proceeded with the round despite the lower valuation because it would give “peace of mind to investors, that even during a black swan event . . . we can still raise money”.</p> <p>He added that the company “doesn't necessarily need the money, we are close to break even”, but that the extra funding provided a buffer for a “rainy day” and could be used to finance acquisitions as start-up valuation.</p> <p>The funding round, the start-up's first since 2017 when Christ said it was valued at closer to €400mn, was led by private equity firm Bain Capital. BlackRock, Centerbridge, and Crestline were among other asset managers to invest.</p> <p>SumUp is far from the only payments company affected by investors souring on what were until recently some of the world's most highly valued technology companies. </p> <p>Last week, it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b6ff18d-e990-4578-886b-a22cb1878a5e\">reported</a> that Swedish “buy now, pay later” business Klarna — which for a time was Europe's largest privately held company — is trying to raise new cash at less than half its peak $46bn valuation.</p> <p>SumUp and Klarna are suffering from the sell-off in listed tech companies, which have plunged about 25 per cent this year. Investors have been spooked by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77665e8d-e3bb-4fc7-8547-b368c8b90f47\">actions taken by central banks to tame inflation</a>, the anticipated slowdown in consumer spending from the cost-of-living crisis and the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>Christ said he was actually “happier” to be valued at €8bn, noting that the value is still 20 times larger that compared with five years ago.</p> <p>“It definitely makes life easier,” he said. “I can very comfortably say the €8bn is a true and fair valuation, because that's the price people put on the company in the worst of markets. I don't think the price will ever be any lower than that.</p> <p>“I wasn't really involved in the $22bn valuation . . . the market was overheated [and] there were all sorts of rumours at the time,” he said. “Someone looked at public numbers and guessed at what could be.”</p> <p>SumUp, which was founded in 2012, works with 4mn small businesses globally, providing merchants with a business account and card, as well as invoicing tools and other payment services.</p> <p>Christ said even though the business is growing organically, he would consider using the new funding further acquisitions. </p> <p>“In this environment we think we will see good opportunities for M&amp;A deals once people realise that money is not free any more,” the founder said.</p> <p>Last year, it bought US customer loyalty site Fivestars, for $317mn. The fintech has snapped up other point-of-sale businesses, including UK-based company Goodtill and Tiller, which is headquartered in Jersey.</p> <p>It bought Polish ecommerce company Shoplo in 2019, which boosted its active users by 1mn.</p> <p>SumUp has also raised debt over the past few years to help fund its expansion. Last year, it raised €750mn from Goldman Sachs, Temasek, Bain Capital Credit, Crestline, and Oaktree. </p> <p>Christ said the company's current debt amounts to just over €1bn.</p><p>Source: Stephen Morris and Emma Dunkley in London 2022 'SumUp struggles to €8bn valuation as tech sell-off hits UK fintech' FT.com 23 June.
