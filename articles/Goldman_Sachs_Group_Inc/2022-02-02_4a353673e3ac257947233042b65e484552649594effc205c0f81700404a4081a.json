  "title": "Alphabet  Ad Sales  Drive  Strong  Results  ----  By Tripp Mickle",
  "text": "<p>   Google parent Alphabet Inc. posted another quarter of strong sales growth, capping a year when profit nearly doubled despite mounting regulatory pressure that threatens the search company's future. </p><p>   The company's dominance in online search, video and internet ad sales made it one of last year's leading beneficiaries of an upswing in digital advertising. Last year, small and large businesses flooded into the ad market to win customers who spent early parts of the pandemic sequestered in their homes. </p><p>   Alphabet on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter revenue of $75.33 billion, an increase of 32% from a year earlier when ad spending began to swell in anticipation that the economy would snap back in 2021 after the Covid-19 pandemic receded. </p><p>   Profit rose by a third, closing out a year when the company's annual profit increased by almost $36 billion from 2020, more than the profits of Goldman Sachs Inc. and Visa Inc. combined. </p><p>   The company also said that it would do a 20-for-1 split of its stock. The move comes after Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc. split their own shares in recent years. </p><p>   The quarterly sales gain was the lowest the company has recorded for a three-month period since late 2020 and marks a deceleration from the 41% increase reported for the July-to-September quarter. The moderating growth has divided investors, with some optimistic Google will extend its momentum over the coming year as Covid-19 wanes and travel returns, while others fear TikTok will dent YouTube's video dominance and rising costs will lower margins. </p><p>   The divide has been apparent in the company's share performance this year. </p><p>   After rising 65% last year, shares fell more than 10% in January amid a broad market selloff. Shares rose almost 9% in after-hours trading on Tuesday. </p><p>   The results were the first in a series to come from tech's leading ad companies. Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. reports on Wednesday and Snap Inc. will post results on Thursday. </p><p>   The biggest peril for Google comes from regulators in the U.S. and Europe who are filing lawsuits and proposing legislation to curtail its dominance. In the U.S., the company faces separate antitrust lawsuits against its ad-tech, search and app-store businesses, as well as state cases over claims it deceptively collected customers' location information. </p><p>   It also faces proposed legislation that would limit tech companies' ability to favor their own businesses as well as a new bill being led by Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah) that would force it to divest itself of its ad-tech unit. </p><p>   At best, the challenges will saddle the company with legal fees and discourage acquisitions that could draw regulators' ire, according to analysts. At worst, the company could be forced to unload some business units to comply with judicial rulings or new laws. </p><p>   Alphabet Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said that he has urged Congress to take its time on potential legislation, noting the importance of avoiding \"unintended consequences.\" </p><p>   He said the company has encouraged Congress to focus on areas where there is widespread agreement, such as protecting children online, and to avoid hurting \"American competitiveness by disadvantaging, solely, U.S. companies.\" </p><p></p>",
