  "text": "<p>In business school, many McKinsey consultants undoubtedly would have read the <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Motivation/Kerr_Folly_of_rewarding_A_while_hoping_for_B.pdf\">classic 1975 paper</a> “On the Folly of Rewarding ‘A' While Hoping for ‘B'”. Steven Kerr, the paper's business executive author, described the ways organisations can trip themselves up when their incentive systems are unwittingly constructed to violate their stated values. Universities, for example, say they value teaching skills, yet base academic promotions on research output.</p> <p>When it comes to management consulting, McKinsey and its peers profess to thoughtfully help CEOs to grow long-term value for all stakeholders. But in the cut-throat hallways of professional services firms, the only way up is to generate as much revenue as quickly as possible.</p> <p>On Thursday, the vaunted boardroom whisperer McKinsey shared its updated values. Circumstances were unpleasant. The consultancy has agreed to a total<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85e84e12-6dda-4c91-bde4-8198e29a6767\"> $574m</a> settlement with virtually every US state and several territories. They had pursued McKinsey for its role in helping Purdue Pharma and others peddle the opioids that fuelled a nationwide addiction crisis. Emails and other documents discovered and disclosed revealed a discussion on the possible destruction of documents. McKinsey has not admitted wrongdoing.</p> <p>The consultancy said it has updated its code of conduct as well as redefined how it will accept clients and mandates. The proof of reform is a willingness to embrace principles when they reduce the bottom line</p> <p>Professional advisers have long avoided culpability for the bad behaviour of those they advise. This is partly because of formal detachment. In the case of lawyers, social value is ascribed to even the guilty and notorious receiving the best possible counsel. But as banks, law firms and consultants are known to draw upon the “best and brightest” the temptation also arises to worship blindly these human gods and dismiss their frailties.</p> <p>In the past year, scandals involving Wirecard, 1MDB and others have implicated several high-status firms. Yet the likes of Goldman Sachs still dominate league tables and can apparently write modest cheques to resolve their troubles. It may be that prospective clients need to start punishing firms whose alleged conduct has been poor. If values are not enough for the likes of McKinsey to make better choices, then a pain in the P&amp;L may be the only behavioural cue that really works.</p><p>Source:  2021 'McKinsey: A/B testing' FT.com 4 February.
