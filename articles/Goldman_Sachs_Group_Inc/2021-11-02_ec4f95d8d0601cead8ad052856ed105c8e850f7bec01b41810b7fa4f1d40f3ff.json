  "text": "<p>BlackRock, the largest institutional investor in THG, has sold almost half of its stake in the UK ecommerce group after a sharp fall in the share price in recent months.</p> <p>The world's largest asset manager sold 58m shares in THG at 195p per share, according to bookrunner Goldman Sachs, a 10.3 per cent discount to the closing price on Monday. </p> <p>As of October 13, BlackRock owned a 9.55 per cent stake in the group across multiple active and passive funds, according to Capital IQ data, and was the largest investor after THG's founder and chief executive Matthew Moulding, who owns about 15 per cent of the company.</p> <p>THG, formerly known as The Hut Group, floated at 500p a share in September 2020. A post-listing rally took the stock to almost 800p. However, its shares have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea3565cb-dd5c-445c-b9d7-80ca19bff9ec\">under sustained pressure</a> in recent months, reflecting investor concerns about governance, strategy and valuation.</p> <p>BlackRock's active funds bought into THG before its initial public offering. One person close to the asset manager said reducing the stake reflected “prudent risk management as the stock has fallen”. </p> <p>The person added: “We still support management and remain invested in the company. We believe in the stock's fundamentals and there have been improvements on the governance side.” </p> <p>But one analyst who follows the company said that while it was unwise to “get too carried away by single shareholder decisions”, BlackRock had been close to the company since about 2014 and seemed to have “just rushed for the door in the wake of the stock cratering”.</p> <p>“You can't help but wonder what they've picked up on to cause such a hasty withdrawal,” the analyst added.</p> <p>THG has three main business units: Beauty and Nutrition, both of which are ecommerce operations selling brands such as Espa and Myprotein direct to consumers, and Ingenuity, which provides ecommerce technology products and services.</p> <p>Ingenuity has drawn scrutiny since May, when THG said it had granted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad173723-47a5-4d44-8cd0-1b5e11c44db6\">an option to buy</a> a 20 per cent stake in the business to funds linked to Japanese investment group SoftBank at a price that implied an enterprise value of £4.5bn for the entire unit.</p> <p>Analysts and investors have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7466fff9-d827-4902-8e9f-4b61a26201a7\">struggled to reconcile</a> this valuation. It is £2bn&#xa0;higher than the current market capitalisation of the whole of THG and the group has never disclosed a profit for Ingenuity. The division has reported contract wins but revenues are growing from a small base.<br><strong><br></strong>THG has sought to improve its governance and transparency. Andreas Hansson, a managing director at SoftBank, is joining its board, and it is recruiting a non-executive chair. The company, meanwhile, has brought forward the end date of a “special share”&#xa0;arrangement that allows Moulding to veto a hostile takeover.</p> <p>Some retail investors have been buying the stock. A report on Tuesday by Interactive Investor, the UK's second-largest investment platform, said that THG was the third most bought equity on its platform during October, behind online retailer Boohoo Group and British Airways owner IAG.</p> <p>THG shares fell 6 per cent to 205p on Tuesday morning.</p> <p>BlackRock declined to comment. THG did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Jonathan Eley and Joshua Oliver</em></p><p>Source: Harriet Agnew and Bryce Elder in London 2021 'BlackRock sells almost half its stake in THG' FT.com 2 November.
