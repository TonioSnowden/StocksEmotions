  "title": "Pressure at Firm Triggers  $30 Billion Stock Selloff  ----  By Juliet Chung and Maureen Farrell",
  "text": "<p>   One mystery in a dramatic year on Wall Street has been the identity of a trader whose persistent purchases have sent shares in ViacomCBS Inc., Discovery Inc. and a handful of other companies surging even when the broader market was down. </p><p>   People familiar with the transactions said the answer is former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang. Late last week Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG swiftly unloaded large blocks of shares in those companies and others, part of the liquidation of positions at Mr. Hwang's Archegos Capital Management. </p><p>   The sales approached $30 billion in value, some of the people said, and fueled a 27% plunge Friday in shares of Viacom -- an unusually large decline in a widely held, large-capitalization stock on a day with no significant company-specific news. Billions of dollars in market value in other companies were wiped out as the sales continued, surprising market participants who called the size and speed of these stock sales unprecedented. </p><p>   The liquidations appear to have left Archegos, which managed an estimated $10 billion of personal wealth for Mr. Hwang and his family, under extreme pressure following heavy losses. People close to the stock sales said that the bulk of the selling has been completed. </p><p>   Class A shares of Discovery dropped $15.85, or 27%, to $41.90 on Friday, the largest percentage decrease since September 2008. And a punishing day-long selloff for ViacomCBS continued, as the shares dropped $18.12, or 27%, the largest percentage decrease on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data going back to 1990 </p><p>   Shares of a U.S.-listed Chinese entertainment company, iQIYI Inc., also sold in block trades Friday as part of the unwinding, fell 13% to $17.43. </p><p>   Discovery released a statement in response to the selloff on Friday reaffirming its guidance to Wall Street. </p><p>   The losses mark the latest public setback for the publicity-shy Mr. Hwang, whose prior firm, Tiger Asia Management LLC, in 2012 pleaded guilty to a criminal fraud charge. Tiger Asia also agreed to pay $44 million to settle civil allegations by U.S. securities regulators that it engaged in insider trading of Chinese bank stocks. </p><p>   Mr. Hwang and Archegos's co-chief executive, Andy Mills, didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>   According to people familiar with the fund, the highly leveraged Archegos took big, concentrated positions in companies and held some positions via swaps, contracts brokered by Wall Street banks that allow a user to take on the profits and losses of a portfolio of stocks or other assets in exchange for a fee. </p><p>   The use of swaps allowed Mr. Hwang to maintain his anonymity, even as Archegos was estimated to have had exposure to the economics of more than 10% of multiple companies' shares. Investors holding more than 10% of a company's securities are deemed to be company insiders and are subject to additional regulations around disclosures and profits. </p><p>   Stock blocks sold Friday amounted to 10% or more of shares outstanding in companies including online luxury retailer Farfetch Ltd. and New York-listed Chinese tutoring company GSX Techedu Inc. </p><p>   The episode reignites debate over whether the use of swaps presents a market vulnerability. </p><p>   The dynamics are reminiscent of the market upheaval in late January, when meteoric surges in GameStop Corp. and other companies popular with individual investors upended hedge funds' short bets against the companies. Here, though, a major actor in supporting companies' share prices appears to have been undone by his continuing to add to leveraged bets as markets soared, a strategy that fell apart when some of those bets started to reverse on him. </p><p>   Mr. Hwang's strategy began backfiring in recent weeks as the stock price of companies Archegos had significant exposure to, including in China Internet search giant Baidu Inc. and Farfetch, began to sell off. Baidu's stock price rose sharply in February, but by mid-March, its shares had dropped more than 20% from its highs. </p><p>   Farfetch's stock followed a similar trajectory, dropping more than 15% off its February highs by March. </p><p>   The announcement of additional financing by ViacomCBS early last week put further stress on Archegos, said people familiar with the matter, with news of the deal sparking a slide in the shares and adding to Archegos's mounting losses. The fund by that time had started selling some of its position in ViacomCBS to try to offset its losses, adding to pressure on the stock. </p><p>   ViacomCBS shares had surged 160% since the start of the year through March 22, with the launch earlier this month of its new Paramount+ streaming service contributing to gains. Discovery also recently launched a streaming service, which analysts said buttressed its stock price. </p><p>   Still, ViacomCBS stock at times rose even as the broader market fell the week of March 15, leading some traders to speculate a ViacomCBS investor was propping up its price and trying to squeeze short sellers. In a short squeeze, short sellers are forced to buy back shares to close out their losing bets, pushing prices sharply higher in the process. </p><p>   Similarly, GSX's resilient stock price despite heavy attacks from activist short sellers and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission had perplexed hedge funds shorting the stock. Goldman and Morgan Stanley on Friday sold a total of nearly 33 million shares of GSX in block trades, traders said. </p><p>   Multiple banks including Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche, Credit Suisse Group AG, and UBS Group AG served as prime brokers to Archegos, meaning they processed its trades and lent it cash and securities. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Gunjan Banerji, Benjamin Mullin and Jim Oberman contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
