  "text": "<p>The FCPA, which bars companies from paying bribes to foreign public officials, has become one of the government's most potent tools for policing business overseas. The law applies to U.S. companies and to foreign companies listed on a U.S. stock exchange or with other U.S. ties.</p><p>Since the early 2000s, the Justice Department's enforcement of the law has led to a string of blockbuster settlements with some of the world's most well-known companies, including a $1.6 billion fine involving Siemens AG in 2008 and a $2.9 billion fine for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reached last year.</p><p>Mr. Kahn joined the Justice Department's fraud section, part of its criminal division, in 2010, and became chief of its FCPA unit in 2016.</p><p>In recent years, Mr. Kahn held a number of senior positions in the fraud section and criminal division. But he continued to be a key steward of the department's FCPA program, appearing on panels about the antibribery law at compliance conferences and at an appeals court hearing involving a former Alstom SA executive who was charged with violating the law.</p><p>Write to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com</p><p>Foreign Bribery Prosecutor Daniel Kahn Departs Justice Department</p>",
