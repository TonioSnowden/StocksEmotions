  "title": "Linse Capital Nets $700 Million to Back Late-Stage Startups in Industrial Tech; Puerto Rico-based growth equity firm aims to be one of the largest shareholders in its portfolio companies before it cashes out",
  "text": "<p>The capital will be allocated across the firm's flagship fund—Linse Capital Fund I—and two co-investment vehicles that will be used to make follow-on investments into two of its portfolio companies. The flagship fund will receive $563 million, while $137 million will be dedicated to autonomous-drone startup Skydio Inc. and Verkada Inc., which develops cloud-based building security systems, Linse said.</p><p>Linse plans to target startups operating in four sectors: transportation, energy, logistics and real estate. The firm's managers believe that these industrial-tech startups have been overlooked by venture capitalists because challenges for each company can be highly specific and require extensive expertise to solve, said Bastiaan Janmaat, Linse's managing director.</p><p>\"It's riskier, but then if you break through those risks, and you succeed in getting to some level of traction, then all those risks become a moat around your business and it's very difficult to displace you; it's hard for other startups to compete with you,\" Mr. Janmaat said.</p><p>Recent U.S. legislation adds subsidies and tax incentives that will make investing in the industrial-tech sector attractive, he added.</p><p>U.S. venture investors committed roughly $6 billion to industrial and energy startups during the third quarter of 2022, according to a report by consulting firm Ernst &amp; Young.</p><p>Linse's strategy is to back only a handful of new companies each year, investing between $100 million and $400 million in each business throughout its involvement, Mr. Janmaat said. The firm aims to become one of the largest shareholders in its portfolio companies by the time it is ready to sell, he added.</p><p>For instance, Linse was an early investor in ChargePoint Inc., an electric-vehicle charging infrastructure company. Linse said it was the largest shareholder when the company held its initial public offering in 2021.</p><p>Linse has raised roughly $1.1 billion from limited partners including more than 400 family offices and investment firms. Investors include affiliates of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. and investment arms of public companies in the transportation, energy, logistics and real-estate industries. Linse counts Germany-based vehicle maker Daimler Truck AG and mobile-phone operator Taiwan Mobile as limited partners.</p><p>Mr. Janmaat said that Linse executives also commit their own capital to the firm.</p><p>\"Puerto Rico is an efficient place tax-wise to be able to recycle a lot of your earnings back into the funds that we raise,\" Mr. Janmaat said about why the firm is based in the U.S. territory.</p><p>Linse Capital was founded in 2015 by former Kleiner Perkins partner Michael Linse. Messrs. Linse and Janmaat worked together previously as investors at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and now co-manage Linse Capital.</p><p>Write to Marc Vartabedian at marc.vartabedian@wsj.com</p>",
