  "title": "China's 5.5% Growth Target Is a Big Reach; Russia's invasion of Ukraine and soaring oil prices are latest obstacle to hitting growth targets in pivotal year politically for Xi Jinping",
  "text": "<p>Now, new threats are arising: Rapidly rising Brent crude oil prices, now above $120 a barrel, and a likely further slowdown in global growth and trade due to the conflict in Ukraine. China's enormous trade surpluses, which already were expected to decline this year as developed economies further reopen and shift consumption back toward services, will come under more pressure.</p><p>The biggest immediate headwind is rising oil prices. As the world's largest crude importer and energy consumer, China can't avoid a big hit from crude prices which are now up by close to $30 a barrel since late February. Every $20 rise in oil prices knocks about 0.3 percentage point off China's growth, says Goldman Sachs, meaning a hit of half a point this year if oil prices average $135 a barrel for the rest of the year as the bank forecasts.</p><p>Meanwhile, despite some tentative positive signs in late 2021, China's critical property sector—which typically drives around 20% of the economy—remains deep in the doldrums. Weekly floor space sold in 30 large and medium-size cities, which had begun to recover in late 2021 following easier mortgage-lending standards, has recently fallen back again. A renewed rash of property developer defaults and payment delays has spooked markets and helped push Chinese bond yields, which had been trending down, back up again.</p><p>The big hope for 2022 is fiscal policy: While the official deficit forecast ticked down marginally and the quota for local government special project bonds has been held steady, a big chunk of unspent bond proceeds from last year could help boost infrastructure spending.</p><p>But there are two problems: First, overall financial conditions appear to be tightening again in the wake of renewed real-estate jitters, meaning higher fiscal spending could be offset by a pullback from households and firms. And second, such special project bonds typically only account for about 20% of total infrastructure spending, notes HSBC. The lion's share is funded by off-budget sources, including land sales—currently under heavy pressure from the property downturn—and borrowing by so-called local government financing vehicles. Since the latter are heavily dependent on the bond market, rising yields there will weigh on infrastructure investment, too.</p><p>In a critical political year when General Secretary Xi Jinping is bidding for a third term atop the Communist Party, local officials will be under strong pressure to deliver on growth. That translates into an elevated risk of fudged numbers this year. But to hit anything like 5.5% growth in reality—rather than just on paper—substantially more stimulus, in particular the monetary variety, will be needed.</p><p>Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com</p><p>China's 5.5% Growth Target Is a Big Reach</p>",
