  "text": "<p><strong>Just Eat Takeaway</strong>&#xa0;will be ejected from the FTSE&#xa0;100 after index compiler FTSE Russell switched its nationality from the&#xa0;UK&#xa0;to&#xa0;the Netherlands. </p> <p>A change in domicile will make the takeaway ordering group ineligible to be included in the FTSE&#xa0;UK&#xa0;Index Series, <a href=\"https://www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-uk-index-series-indicative-quarterly-review-changes-september-2021\">FTSE Russell said</a>. </p> <p>Dechra Pharmaceuticals, defence group Meggitt and Wm Morrison Supermarkets are all in line for promotion to the FTSE 100 at the next review, which will be framed around closing prices on August 31 and announced the day after. ITV, Just Eat and engineer Weir Group are in line to drop out. </p> <p>On Tuesday's standings Just Eat was the FTSE 100's 38th biggest company with a market value of £14.7bn. The company, which was formed by the merger in 2020 of Just Eat with Amsterdam-based Takeaway.com, has been fending off calls from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52cff7e0-0b24-404c-8bb5-0a4ee177204f\">activist investor Cat Rock Capital</a> to divest assets or explore a merger with a larger rival.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Waste management group <strong>Augean</strong> said it had agreed to a £341m buyout offer from an investment fund consortium, which trumped an earlier bid from Morgan Stanley Infrastructure. Augean said it was recommending the 325p a share offer from Eleia, a vehicle comprising of funds managed by Ancala Partners and Fiera Infrastructure. Morgan Stanley had in July offered 280p per share for Augean.</p> <p>Builders' merchant <strong>Grafton </strong>said it was on track to meet full-year guidance in spite of supply chain disruption. Half-year results from Grafton showed underlying operating profit more than trebling to £142.4m as revenue grew 46.1 per cent to £1bn. </p> <p>Activist investor Cevian Capital has raised its stake in insurer <strong>Aviva</strong> to 5.02 per cent from 4.95 per cent in June, a stock exchange filing showed. </p> <p><strong>Costain</strong>, the construction engineering group, said it was on course to deliver full-year results in line with expectations. It posted an interim adjusted pre-tax profit of £9.4m, up 147 per cent year on year, and reported contract wins over the period with a total value of £334.3m.</p> <p><strong>Sopheon</strong> said performance has remained solid as the software maker implemented a new strategy to switch customers on to services contracts. The company posted an interim profit of £370,000, up 12.5 per cent year on year.</p> <p><strong>Clipper Logistics</strong>, which runs delivery services for retailers including John Lewis and Superdry, posted an annual profit up 33.8 per cent to £21.7m. It said the new financial year had started strongly and trading was in line with its recently upgraded guidance. Group revenue for its year ended April rose by 39.1 per cent to £696.2m.</p> <p><strong>Nostrum Oil &amp; Gas</strong> said it had disposed of its rights and obligations to drill in the Rostoshinskoye field in north-western Kazakhstan ahead of a contract expiry next year. Disposal was the most cost-effective option for the company, it said. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>The <strong>US House of Representatives</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35409788-f5f3-466e-9095-ab0a55ff98b2?emailId=6125ba380266fa0004fa2812&amp;segmentId=22011ee7-896a-8c4c-22a0-7603348b7f22\">approved the framework</a> for Joe Biden's $3.5tn domestic spending package after Democrats reached a deal to advance the legislation following days of tense talks within the party. The 220-212 vote on the so-called budget resolution marked a crucial step towards enacting the president's&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffb784da-a06d-4b01-87bd-e526f2cebc19\">economic agenda</a>.</p> <p><strong>TPG</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/688edf60-c912-443d-b2a3-4cef8a2d778b\">appointed Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase</a> to work on an initial public offering, inching closer to an outcome that the private equity firm contemplated for much of the past decade but delayed while it shifted strategy and recovered from the poor performance of some investments.</p> <p><strong>T Rowe Price</strong>'s top-rated active fund manager David Giroux has&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67142c8b-d4f2-4eef-9d34-1f66da3cb5c2\">backed away</a>&#xa0;from a “rich” US equity market, reflecting nerves among investors about the lofty valuations that have become entrenched since markets rebounded from the pandemic lows of last year.</p> <p><strong>OnlyFans</strong> founder Tim Stokely has blamed&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b8ce71c-a87a-440e-9f3d-58069ca0480b\">“unfair” treatment</a>&#xa0;by banks for forcing him to ban pornography on the social media platform, a decision that caused an outcry from the site's users and sowed doubt over its future.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> The decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61ee57ff-673a-44d6-830e-3aa2b52041ea\">extend a deadline</a> for companies to certify manufactured products with a new UK quality mark is ideology again colliding with reality and losing. </p> <p><strong>Brooke Masters</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c24c9c5c-859f-4773-bb23-8f937a6f4cde\">success of Cambridge</a> as a tech hub has lessons for others who would emulate Silicon Valley. Patience and a flexible approach to ownership have made the university town a safe place to do risky things.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Just Eat Takeaway faces ejection from FTSE 100' FT.com 25 August.
