  "title": "U.S. News: Pace of Rate Rises Stirs Some Concern",
  "text": "<p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has said the central bank isn't trying to cause a recession, but it can't fail in its effort to bring down inflation. \"I wish there was a painless way to do that. There isn't,\" he said last month.</p><p>Still, several analysts worry the Fed is on track to raise rates higher than required, potentially triggering a deeper-than-necessary downturn.</p><p>\"They've done a tremendous amount of tightening,\" said Greg Mankiw, a Harvard University economist who advised President George W. Bush. \"Recessions are painful for a lot of people. I think Powell's right that some pain is probably inevitable. . .but you don't want to cause more than is necessary.\"</p><p>Until June, officials hadn't lifted rates by 0.75 point, or 75 basis points, since 1994. They usually preferred making smaller quarter-point increases that gave them more time to see their economic effects.</p><p>\"I would slowly ease the foot off the brake,\" Mr. Mankiw said. \"That means probably for a given meeting, if they're debating 50 or 75, go with 50 instead of 75.\"</p><p>Former Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn agrees it is near time for Fed officials to slow their rate increases. \"They need to downshift soon. They need to somehow downshift without backing off,\" he said.</p><p>Fed officials left rates near zero last year as they focused on spurring a strong labor market recovery. The war in Ukraine this spring sent commodity prices higher and fueled concerns that inflation might become embedded into wage and price contracts.</p><p>\"Moving in these 75-basis-point steps was effective when the Fed had a long way to go. It becomes more problematic when they need to calibrate policy more carefully, and I believe we're approaching that point,\" said Brian Sack, who ran the New York Fed's markets desk from 2009 to 2012 and is now the director of economics at hedge-fund manager D.E. Shaw.</p><p>Some Fed critics say the current surge in inflation is the result of global disruptions rather than an overheated U.S. labor market, and they are pointing to signs that prices have begun to fall for a swath of goods and services, including commodities, freight shipping, and housing.</p><p>Housing costs have contributed notably to inflation in recent months amid large increases over the past year in residential rents. But housing demand is falling sharply as the 30-year mortgage rate nears 7%, a 16-year high -- a direct result of the Fed's rate increases. Home prices started to fall this summer in more U.S. markets, and economists at Goldman Sachs expect price drops of between 5% and 10% nationally by the end of next year. Apartment rent increases also have begun to slow.</p><p>Asset prices have also taken a beating,which tends to reduce spending and investment.A portfolio invested 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds is down nearly 20% this year.</p><p>\"The housing market doesn't look pretty, and that will eventually spread to the rest of the economy,\" said Mr. Mankiw. Lower asset prices will, too, at some point, he said.</p><p>Fed officials are cautious about expecting inflation to fall because it has consistently defied such forecasts over the past year. Some have pointed to risks of additional economic disruptions -- for example, higher energy prices this winter if Russia suspends oil sales.</p><p>Eric Rosengren, who headed the Boston Fed from 2007 until last year, said he sees the Fed's projected policy path as broadly appropriate. \"If anything, I think the risks show they're going to have to raise rates a bit more than they're suggesting,\" he said.</p>",
