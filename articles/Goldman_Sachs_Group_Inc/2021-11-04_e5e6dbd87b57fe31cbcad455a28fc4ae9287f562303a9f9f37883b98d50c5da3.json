  "title": "U.S. News: Murphy Ekes Out a Narrow Win in N.J.",
  "text": "<p>The Associated Press declared Mr. Murphy the winner Wednesday evening, when the Democrat was ahead by about 19,000 votes out of more than 2.4 million ballots cast.</p><p>Mr. Murphy campaigned on his record during his first term in office, touting the legalization of marijuana and increases to the state's minimum wage during his tenure. In recent weeks, both President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris appeared with Mr. Murphy in the state.</p><p>Mr. Ciattarelli criticized Mr. Murphy's fiscal policies and promised to cut state spending. Mr. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive who was first elected in 2017, raised taxes on millionaires and expanded educational programs.</p><p>New Jersey has the highest property taxes relative to home value of any state, according to a study released this summer by the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based think tank that generally favors lower tax rates.</p><p>Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than one million in the state, according to the New Jersey secretary of state's office. That's up from a Democratic advantage of around 700,000 voters in 2009, when Republican Chris Christie defeated Jon Corzine's bid for a second term.</p><p>New Jersey doesn't require recounts in close elections, but a candidate can request one from a judge if they have reason to believe there has been a vote-counting error.</p><p>Mr. Murphy said late Wednesday the results showed that New Jersey voters wished to continue with the direction he has set. \"We need to keep moving forward on our shared journey to a stronger and fairer New Jersey,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Ciattarelli's campaign spokeswoman, Stami Williams, said all options remain on the table. \"With the candidates separated by a fraction of a percent out of 2.4 million ballots cast, it's irresponsible of the media to make this call when the New Jersey secretary of state doesn't even know how many ballots are left to be counted,\" Ms. Williams said.</p><p>Polls in the weeks before the election projected Mr. Murphy with a comfortable lead, and Republicans said the closer-than-expected result was a sign of voter frustration.</p><p>During the campaign Mr. Murphy said he provided stable management during the Covid-19 pandemic, and Monmouth University polls showed his job approval rating remained above 50% since the virus arrived in March 2020.</p><p>Mr. Ciattarelli has criticized Mr. Murphy's requirement that school students wear masks in the classroom and faulted the governor for a policy early in the pandemic that allowed nursing homes to accept Covid-19 patients from hospitals. Mr. Murphy said masking is needed to keep children safe and called the coronavirus nursing home deaths a tragedy.</p><p>Voters' concerns about Covid-19 waned in the weeks leading up to the election, leaving an opening for Mr. Ciattarelli's core fiscal campaign theme, said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.</p><p>Julie Roginsky, a Democratic consultant who worked for Mr. Murphy during his 2017 campaign, said he could have had a stronger showing if he had focused more on affordability and less on national trends. \"It turns out that you can't ignore the No. 1 issue that voters in New Jersey have had for the last 30 years -- affordability and property taxes -- and expect to win,\" she said.</p>",
