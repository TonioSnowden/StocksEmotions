Need we say more?&#xa0;</p> <p>In recent days shares in the gaming retailer have rallied almost 2,000 per cent, sent Wall Street into meltdown, and made a trader with the username “DeepFuckingValue” a household name.&#xa0;</p> <p>Unless you've been living under a rock (in which case, congrats, and can we join you?), you've probably heard about the GameStop saga.</p> <p>If not, here's a quick recap: a bunch of traders — many amateurs — got together on the online discussion forum <strong>Reddit</strong> and decided they were going to pump up GameStop's share price to get under the skin of some short-sellers.&#xa0;</p> <p>The event, unlike many others, has prompted a lot of soul searching on Wall Street. Hedge funds, in particular, seem to be going through the five stages of grief.&#xa0;</p> <p>One of the hedge funds that has felt the wrath of Redditors is <strong>Melvin Capital</strong>. The group, which tends to run a pretty aggressive short book, had bet that GameStop shares would fall.&#xa0;</p> <p>We don't have the exact details of when this bet was made and how big it was but considering GameStop shares have gone from about $5 in August 2020 to almost $350 on Wednesday, it's safe to say Melvin was bleeding a lot.&#xa0;</p> <p>So much, in fact, that founder <strong>Gabe Plotkin</strong>'s old boss stepped in for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1791269f-fe8c-47e3-b933-62125ee83242\">a much-needed capital injection</a>.<strong> Steve Cohen</strong>'s <strong>Point72 Asset Management</strong> put in $750m while <strong>Ken Griffin</strong>'s <strong>Citadel</strong> added another $2bn.</p> <p>Melvin appeared to reach acceptance quicker than the market by exiting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8be64f49-7c90-4fae-8370-c5c5c96d812c\">the bet against GameStop</a>. It had lost $3.75bn in the first three weeks of January, much of which was down to the Gamestop trade going horribly wrong.</p> <p>It was Melvin's misfortune that captured the attention of Plotkin's fellow professional traders and made GameStop a hot topic. Hedge funds don't tend to care much about how their rivals are performing but they do care if they perceive a systematic threat that could wreak havoc on their own portfolios.&#xa0;</p> <p>And so here we are. Reddit traders are “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae1ecff4-9019-4a2a-97ea-55a3cd15c36a\">weaponising</a>” financial derivatives against Wall Street, the creators of financial derivatives, in a war of attrition. The contagion <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acc1dbfe-80a4-4b63-90dd-05f27f21ceb2\">has spread to Europe</a> where day traders are on the hunt for the next GameStop.&#xa0;</p> <p>Are we looking at the new masters of the universe? Unlikely. But day traders have managed to play hedge funds at their own game and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AOC/status/1354536220110577664\">Schadenfreude is real</a>.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Hong Kong's new exit interview?</h2> <p>“Hong Kong as we know it is dead,” a hedge fund adviser <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2acb077f-9f81-4457-9932-5223334facee\">told the FT</a> in June when the Chinese government approved new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16be5051-bf0a-4676-beb7-b781973bbff5\">national security laws</a> on the territory designed to clamp down on the growing political unrest.</p> <p>Six months later, the dark prophecy may be coming true.</p> <p>For the hordes of fund managers and bankers that have for decades basked in Asia's premier glittering financial hub, the crackdown meant the former British colony would no longer enjoy the same perks of doing business — namely exemption from the tariffs and restrictions imposed on mainland China.&#xa0;</p> <p>But as they bid their final goodbyes, many financiers flocking to greener pastures received <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76f88fc4-a0c2-42dd-8419-5956477c4a4a\">one last phone call</a>. It was the Hong Kong authorities, and they had a simple question: “Why?”</p> <p>Asset management executives and others described the calls as new and unusual, pressing for detailed explanations behind their decisions to leave.&#xa0;</p> <p>But both Hong Kong's <strong>Securities and Futures Commission</strong> and the <strong>Hong Kong Monetary Authority</strong> played down suggestions of any official campaign or survey of financial institutions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2acb077f-9f81-4457-9932-5223334facee\">relocating</a> out of the territory.</p> <p>Likely on the receiving end of one of those calls was US activist hedge fund <strong>Elliott Management</strong>, founded by billionaire <strong>Paul Singer</strong>, which is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f47107f8-8f9e-4a42-85d4-52c4b3707a13\">exiting Hong Kong</a> after spending the past 15 years making a name for itself out of the region with campaigns including a $2.5bn investment in <strong>SoftBank</strong>, and an ongoing six-year battle with the <strong>Li</strong> family's <strong>Bank of East Asia</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Elliott will move staff based in Hong Kong to its offices in London and Tokyo, which will soon be its only Asian base. It's worth mentioning that a source close to Elliott told our FT colleagues the move has been in the works since 2018 and isn't related to the civil unrest unfolding there.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, it's not alone in abandoning Hong Kong — companies have begun <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3478b85-2be5-449b-90b1-c4ffe78150d8\">quietly reducing</a> headcount in the region or leaving altogether while increasing hiring in rival hubs like Singapore and Tokyo, in what recruiters have called an under-the-radar operation to evade China and Hong Kong's crosshairs without ruffling Communist party feathers.</p> <p>Despite these Irish goodbyes, it may be the case that China has taken notice.</p> <h2>Ferragamo sizes up</h2> <p>Executives in the upper echelons of management at<strong> Salvatore Ferragamo</strong> are waiting for the other shoe to drop as the dynasty behind the luxury brand considers a leadership overhaul.</p> <p>Unlike luxury houses with billionaire backers <em>à la </em><strong>LVMH </strong>and<strong> Bernard Arnault</strong>, smaller brands like the Italian leather maker have been decimated by the pandemic. The brand's revenues dropped 38.5 per cent during the first nine months of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019, as shoppers remained in lockdown limbo.</p> <p>It's a sharp deviation from last year, when the <strong>Ferragamo</strong> family, which owns a 54 per cent stake in <strong>Ferragamo Finanziaria</strong>, the holding company that controls the brand, explored selling a minority stake to raise capital.</p> <p>But several investors approached with the deal took issue with the Ferragamos' stronghold over the company's governance, which wouldn't budge even if a sale went through, the FT's Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f2e91150-77ad-4474-8e20-28083a6f8fc4\">reports</a> from Milan.</p> <p>And besides, the damage from the coronavirus crisis was enough to scrap those plans. “Covid-19 has been a tsunami for the company but the family loves it and it [is not ready] to sell,” said one of Silvia's sources.</p> <p>Awaiting the family's next move is creative director <strong>Paul Andrew</strong>, a British footwear designer, and chief executive <strong>Micaela Le Divelec</strong>, a former <strong>Gucci</strong> executive, whose efforts to appease a deep-pocketed new generation of Chinese millennials failed to impress.</p> <p>The duo's contracts are unlikely to be renewed, Silvia reports, meaning Le Divelec would be the second chief to depart the company in recent history, following <strong>Eraldo Poletto</strong>'s exit after less than two years on the job <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/adb00dea-1c99-11e8-956a-43db76e69936\">in 2018</a>, as Ferragamo struggled to keep pace with more sought-after labels.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's good news for <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> banker <strong>Claudio Costamagna</strong>, though, who will join the board following the resignation of longtime Ferragamo aid <strong>Giuseppe Anichini</strong>, and whoever replaces <strong>Ferruccio Ferragamo</strong>, Salvatore's eldest son, who helped steer the company through its 2011 IPO.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Walgreens Boots Alliance </strong>has named <strong>Starbucks</strong> chief operating officer<strong> Roz Brewer</strong> as chief executive.
