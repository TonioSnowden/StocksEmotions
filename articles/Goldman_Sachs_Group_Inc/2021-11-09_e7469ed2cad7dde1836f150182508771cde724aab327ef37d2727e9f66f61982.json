  "title": "Pro Bankruptcy Briefing: Chinese Bond Selloff; Mexican Lender Rattles Investors; AMC Shows Pandemic Strains",
  "text": "<p>China's junk-bond selloff intensifies. What began early this summer as a confidence crisis around industry giant China Evergrande Group has spread to several of the country's real-estate firms. At least four developers have defaulted on dollar bonds since September, sparking the biggest selloff that China's international junk-bond market has ever seen.</p><p>And the hits keep coming. Property developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. now says it would speed up asset disposals after missing a payment on a wealth-management product last week. The cumulative cost of reining in real-estate speculation could slow China's growth for years to come, even if it succeeds in avoiding the worst-case scenario of a severe housing correction.</p><p>Meanwhile Evergrande, the country's largest junk-debt issuer, has so far been able to avert a default by making overdue interest payments on its international bonds shortly before the expiration of their 30-day grace periods. The troubled property giant is now scraping together more cash as payments loom ahead, selling some of its stake in a film and media producer.</p><p>Credito Real bonds sink on accounting concerns. Bonds backing Mexican nonbank lender Credito Real S.A. B. de C.V. fell after the company said in a private call that higher interest margins in the third quarter were due to an accounting change rather than borrower repayments. The disclosure fuels some longstanding concerns about the Mexican nonbank sector, a popular target of short sellers.</p><p>Distress</p><p>AMC reports narrower loss as moviegoers return to theaters. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. reported a sharply narrowed quarterly loss as moviegoers returned to theaters, but the company's chief executive said AMC is far from out of the woods. Unlike other major theater chains, the company also must contend with an investor base of thousands of opinionated shareholders who have lobbied its CEO to incorporate changes that initially seemed like temporary pandemic fixes but now look permanent.</p><p>\"We'd not normally be smiling at an attendance level that is half what it was two years ago.\"</p><p>— AMC Entertainment CEO Adam Aron</p><p>Bankruptcy</p><p>Puerto Rico kicks off bankruptcy-exit trial. The U.S. territory kicked off a trial on its bankruptcy-exit plan as the oversight board steering the restructuring efforts argued that most creditors \"enthusiastically\" support the proposed terms.</p><p>Ending the bankruptcy requires convincing Judge Laura Taylor Swain that Puerto Rico's plan treats all creditors fairly when the government's largest single liability—its monthly pension obligations—aren't being reduced. The pension plans in question cover 167,000 retired workers, or 5% of Puerto Rico's population.</p><p>Parent of GC Services files for prepackaged bankruptcy. The parent company of debt collector GC Services LP filed for bankruptcy, aiming to exit quickly with backing from Benefit Street Partners LLC, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other creditors. Despite being \"operationally sound,\" the company said it filed for bankruptcy to deal with its high degree of indebtedness, roughly 14.5 times its 2020 Ebitda.</p><p>Bankrupt payroll lender Alpha Latam names winning bidder. Alpha Latam Management LLC said private equity-backed CFG Partners is the winning bidder for its Colombian loan portfolio, with a $149 million offer. The purchase must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.</p><p>Alpha Latam, which makes payroll loans in Mexico and Colombia, filed for bankruptcy in August. CFG, based in Puerto Rico, makes unsecured personal loans in Panama and the Caribbean, according to its website, and is backed by private equity firm BayBoston. The initial lead bidder had been Cerberus Capital Management LP, which offered $137 million. — Becky Yerak</p><p>‘South Park' creators approved to buy Mexican eatery. The creators of \"South Park\" won bankruptcy-court approval to buy restaurant and family entertainment center Casa Bonita out of bankruptcy, giving them control of the Denver-area establishment years after its appearance in an episode of the hit cartoon show. The judge overseeing Casa Bonita's chapter 11 case signed off on the $3.1 million deal Friday after superfan Andrew Novick withdrew a competing offer.</p><p>Despite the exposure Casa Bonita gained from the \"South Park\" episode, which first aired in 2003, the company behind the restaurant filed for bankruptcy protection in April, citing the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the dining industry. — Andrew Scurria</p><p>Economy</p><p>Fed officials flagged high inflation and worsening public-health as key economic risks. Several regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents said Monday they expect today's high levels of inflation to cool, but some added that if they don't, the central bank might need to raise rates to help bring price pressures back in line.</p><p>Separately, the Fed said the potential for U.S. public health to worsen is one of the greatest near-term risks to the financial system, the Federal Reserve said, while noting that asset prices are susceptible to large declines should investor sentiment shift.</p><p>\"Asset prices may be vulnerable to significant declines should risk appetite fall, progress on containing the virus disappoint, or the recovery stall.\"</p><p>— The Fed's semiannual Financial Stability Report.</p><p>In Other News</p><p>The U.S. Supreme Court declined an opportunity to reexamine a 1992 ruling that bankrupt debtors cannot ditch a lien on an underwater property.
