  "title": "Former Goldman Sachs Banker Convicted of Bribery, Money-Laundering in 1MDB Case; Jury finds Roger Ng guilty on charges connected to multibillion-dollar looting of a Malaysian government fund",
  "text": "<p>The verdict capped a nearly two-month trial and delivered a win to the Justice Department in its yearslong push to hold individuals accountable for the looting of 1Malaysia Development Bhd., a state-controlled economic development company known as 1MDB. The global scandal has been a black mark for Goldman and led to the conviction of a former prime minister in a Malaysian court.</p><p>Federal prosecutors accused Mr. Ng of conspiring with a well-connected financier and a former Goldman partner to pay off officials to win the Wall Street bank lucrative business deals with 1MDB. Goldman raised $6.5 billion in bond offerings for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013, earning hundreds of millions of dollars in fees.</p><p>Much of the $6.5 billion was diverted to offshore bank accounts and shell companies to pay bribes and kickbacks, according to prosecutors. The stolen money was allegedly used to buy a $250 million yacht and luxury real estate and to finance the movie \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\"</p><p>Mr. Ng, the first defendant in the U.S. case to face a jury, took part in the scheme to win accolades at Goldman and to notch $35 million in kickbacks, prosecutors alleged.</p><p>\"Why did he do it?\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith said of Mr. Ng during closing arguments. \"Simple: Glory and greed.\"</p><p>Mr. Ng, a former managing director at Goldman and a Malaysian national, had been in New York awaiting trial since 2019.</p><p>His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said during the trial that his client was innocent and was a scapegoat for former Goldman partner Timothy Leissner, who previously pleaded guilty to violating antibribery laws and conspiring to launder money. Mr. Leissner has been cooperating with federal investigators and was the government's star witness at the trial.</p><p>Over several days of testimony, Mr. Leissner described how he, Mr. Ng and Malaysian financier Jho Low plotted whom to bribe during a 2012 London meeting and crisscrossed the globe to seal deals. Prosecutors have accused Mr. Low of masterminding the heist and using his relationships with top Malaysian government officials to steal $1.42 billion for himself and his associates. Mr. Low has been indicted but is still at large.</p><p>Mr. Agnifilo said Mr. Leissner, Mr. Ng's former boss, wasn't credibleand was testifying in hope of securing a lenient sentence.</p><p>Mr. Leissner told jurors that he received more than $60 million of stolen funds. He also admitted that he initially provided false information to federal investigators when he began cooperating.</p><p>Write to James Fanelli at james.fanelli@wsj.com</p><p>Roger Ng and the 1MDB Scandal</p><p>* Ex-Goldman Banker, a Key 1MDB Trial Witness, Challenged on Testimony (March 2)</p><p>* At Trial, Lawyers Present Clashing Portraits of Goldman Sachs Banker (Feb. 14)</p><p>* Ex-Goldman Banker in 1MDB Case Yields on U.S. Extradition (Feb. 16, 2019)</p><p>* Malaysia's 1MDB Decoded (Nov. 22, 2015)</p><p>Former Goldman Sachs Banker Convicted of Bribery, Money-Laundering in 1MDB Case</p>",
