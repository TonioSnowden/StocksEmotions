  "title": "Goldman Sachs pulls back from retail banking in latest overhaul",
  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs said it was pulling back from its highly touted foray into retail banking to focus on its traditional strengths serving big corporations and wealthy investors as part of a sweeping reorganisation under chief executive David Solomon.</p> <p>Solomon said the Wall Street powerhouse was trying to align its online retail bank operations with its wealth management business, adding the latter was “a better place for us to be focused than to be out massively looking for consumers”.</p> <p>“The concept of really being broad with a consumer footprint is not really playing to our strengths,” he told CNBC. “But when you look at our wealth platform . . . the ability to add banking services to that and align it with that actually plays to our strength.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/980562d6-2db0-4b25-a349-b83d4b86bea7\">Goldman</a> announced its restructuring as it reported third-quarter net income of $3.1bn, or $8.25 a share, down 43 per cent from $5.4bn, or $14.93 a share, a year ago. That beat analysts' estimates of $2.9bn, or $7.75 a share, according to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg, but was still the group's fourth straight quarterly decline.</p> <p>“The scaling back of consumer makes sense,” said Christian Bolu, banking analyst at Autonomous Research. “It's a case of really focusing on existing clients, which probably are very high value, high net worth . . . rather than spending the money to go chase new clients.” </p> <p>Under the revamp, Goldman will fold its trading and investment banking business into one unit as it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dbc28137-e8fe-4c9e-a69c-123a0bd2c5ce\">shrinks from four divisions to three</a>. The plan was announced as the Wall Street bank contends with a prolonged slowdown in investment banking fees. </p> <p>“These organisational changes represent an important and purposeful evolution in our strategic journey, positioning us well to deliver for our clients and unlock shareholder value,” Solomon said in a memo to employees that was seen by the Financial Times.</p> <p>The move reflects the reality that Solomon <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30c61d67-8af9-474e-872a-b0c75258a781\">has yet to convince investors</a> that Goldman has changed substantially from the investment banking and trading-driven house that he inherited four years ago and merits a superior stock market multiple.</p> <p>The reorganisation, the bank's second in less than three years, will break Goldman's consumer business into two areas, reducing the prominence of its push into consumer banking through online retail lender Marcus. Since its launch in 2016, Marcus has come under investor and internal scrutiny over losses and escalating costs.</p> <p>The three divisions will be: a merged investment bank and trading unit; an asset and wealth management division that will house Marcus; and the newly formed Platform Solutions business comprising the rest of Goldman's retail banking operations, such as its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e7086fa-ba0d-4ef7-86e8-35f0907df68a\">Apple credit card partnership</a> and online lender GreenSky as well as the fledgling transaction banking business.</p> <p>Goldman shares rose 2.3 per cent in New York.</p> <p>In the third quarter, the group's net revenues totalled $11.98bn, down from $13.6bn a year earlier but ahead of analysts' forecasts for $11.4bn. Revenues from its trading division, which has benefited from heavy activity during recent market volatility, came in ahead of analysts' estimates.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2022 'Goldman Sachs pulls back from retail banking in latest overhaul' FT.com 18 October.
