  "text": "<p><strong>One FT investigation to start:</strong> Two Deutsche Bahn employees alleged that some senior staff at the state-owned railway company misused corporate funds as part of widespread fraud at one of Europe's largest infrastructure projects. Full story <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7373c137-80ce-4a23-8257-9be3e8af0297\">here</a>.</p> <h2>India's IPO fever begins to fade</h2> <p>It was backed by a star-studded cast of dealmakers from <strong>Alibaba </strong>founder <strong>Jack Ma</strong>, <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> and<strong> SoftBank</strong>'s <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong>.</p> <p>But the stock market debut of tech darling <strong>Paytm</strong>, India's largest-ever IPO, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da21a31a-7b4b-4067-93e3-b228285be0e0\">turned out to be a flop</a>.</p> <p>Shares in the fintech group plunged by<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81d2e1a7-d2c5-43e9-9835-fcd3ce375c6e\"> more than a third</a> in its first two days as a public company, making it one of the worst debuts in Indian stock market history. Shares in the group, which raised $2.5bn and was valued at $20bn, have since bounced but remain about 17 per cent below their issue price.</p> <p>“Obviously the way the stock behaved . . . was unexpected,” Paytm's chief financial officer <strong>Madhur Deora</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81d2e1a7-d2c5-43e9-9835-fcd3ce375c6e\">told the FT</a> earlier this week. “We're totally sensitive to the fact that some of the shareholders who have backed us would not have expected this performance either in the share price,” he said.</p> <p>So what happened? One culprit could be the aggressive pricing. A ruthless regulatory crackdown by Beijing on China's tech giants, which thwarted the mega-listing ambitions of Ma's own <strong>Ant Group</strong>, set the stage for India's contenders to shine. </p> <p>Coupled with India's booming mobile payments industry — fuelled by the growing affordability of smartphones in previously under-developed regions — the conditions seemed perfect for a lofty valuation.</p> <p>Timing was also a perceived advantage. Five years ago, the government's demonetisation initiative suddenly wiped out almost 90 per cent of the cash in circulation, turbocharging the company's user numbers.</p> <p>But fierce competitors were lurking in the shadows. The Indian government's <strong>Unified Payments Interface</strong> digital payments infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0172916e-1a5e-11ea-97df-cc63de1d73f4\">cut into its core business</a>, as <strong>Google</strong>,<strong> Amazon</strong> and <strong>Walmart</strong>-owned <strong>PhonePe</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b18390a7-10e9-4068-8de3-eb2e59012838\">further edged</a> Paytm out of the market. </p> <p>A mobile commerce <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/reliance-agm-jiomart-testing-integration-with-whatsapp-says-mukesh-ambani/articleshow/83809734.cms?from=mdr\">alliance</a> between <strong>Facebook</strong>'s <strong>WhatsApp </strong>and <strong>Reliance Jio</strong>, the mobile phone group controlled by India's richest man <strong>Mukesh Ambani</strong>, also poses a threat.</p> <p>Paytm's billionaire backers and advisers at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> and <strong>Citigroup</strong>, left with all foam and no pop, have little to toast to now. </p> <p>The lukewarm listing has also skimmed much of the froth off India's effervescent IPO market, as investors <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/29b64b68-7499-475c-a26d-ec24714ded6d?\">reassess the values</a> of the country's other tech superstars bound for the <strong>Bombay Stock Exchange</strong> and other international bourses.</p> <p>SoftBank's other racehorses, <strong>Oyo</strong>, the budget hotel group that filed a draft prospectus<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b73cc6b-413f-432e-a9ca-beafdcf2da25\"> to raise $1.1bn</a> last month, and <strong>Ola</strong>, a ride-sharing group planning an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41c617ce-7ce8-4cdf-a418-4b60bd72e2e2\">upcoming listing</a>, are looking less like shoo-ins.</p> <p>“Valuations are running ahead,” said <strong>Mohit Nigam</strong>, a fund manager at<strong> Hem Securities</strong> in Mumbai. “We as investors have to be cautious ahead of the upcoming IPOs because these guys, no matter how good their businesses are . . . one cannot overlook profit and cash flows.”</p> <p>But some Indian tech groups are still rolling high. Shares in <strong>Zomato</strong>, the food delivery company listed in July, more than doubled from its IPO price. Insurance aggregator <strong>PolicyBazaar</strong> and online beauty retailer <strong>Nykaa</strong> are also staying strong since their listings earlier this month.</p> <p>Some of Paytm's biggest investors haven't given up. <strong>BlackRock</strong> and the<strong> Canada Pension Plan Investment Board </strong>were among a group of anchor investors that kept purchasing Paytm shares even after the stock plummeted on Tuesday and Wednesday, as Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-25/blackrock-canada-pension-bought-more-paytm-shares-after-plunge?sref=OziMsGoK\">reports</a>.</p> <p>The weeks to come will show if other investors are still in the betting mood. </p> <h2>Taxpayer on the hook: energy edition</h2> <p>When <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> paid a visit to the headquarters of <strong>Bulb</strong> in Bishopsgate, London in July, he left a luminous review. “Seems incredible to me,” he said of the UK's seventh-largest energy supplier, which offered customers 100 per cent renewable electricity.</p> <p>In the end, it was. Bulb collapsed into “special administration” this week. </p> <p>That means taxpayers are on the hook for a £1.7bn loan to keep the failed company running until April, one of the biggest bailouts since taxpayers propped up <strong>RBS</strong> and <strong>HBOS</strong> during the financial crisis. And they'll be <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/49168b53-83f0-4a85-bca9-589c69ef1d02\">exposed</a> to further rises in wholesale gas prices, which could add hundreds of millions of pounds to the bill. </p> <p>Bulb's founders <strong>Amit Gudka</strong> and <strong>Hayden Wood</strong> own almost half of the company, Sifted <a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/bulb-collapse-shareholder-losses-investors/\">reports</a>. Outside investors including <strong>Yuri Milner</strong>'s <strong>DST Global</strong> and <strong>JamJar Investments</strong>, the fund set up by the founders of <strong>Innocent Drinks</strong>, also stand to lose out. </p> <p>Bulb was operating in a market where analysts had been warning of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d9ad0af-745b-48fa-a956-c50305d6079f\">disaster waiting to happen</a>, because too many companies were offering lossmaking deals with inadequate hedging strategies in place. </p> <p>The start-up, founded in 2013, had grown fast. But it was perennially lossmaking, thinly-capitalised and with thin margins, FT's Helen Thomas <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3e80afe-6efe-41ab-a301-cccccd09ee53\">writes</a>. </p> <p>The problem: the government capped consumers' energy prices, while allowing start-ups chasing growth at all costs to take huge amounts of commodity price risk. </p> <p>In effect, that risk was backstopped by the state. </p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Deutsche Bank </strong>has hired <strong>Chris Byrne</strong> and <strong>Paul Frankfurt </strong>as managing directors in its UK corporate broking unit, based in London. They join from <strong>BNP Paribas</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Ray O'Rourke</strong>, chief executive and founder of <strong>Laing O'Rourke</strong>, the UK's largest privately owned construction group, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1e45316-a87a-4b82-9aaa-326f4f0d9ee8\">plans to step down</a> after 45 years, making way for its new head to lead the group to a stock market listing.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Teeing up billions </strong>LIV Golf Investments, a new company majority owned by the $450bn Saudi sovereign wealth fund, has set out to revolutionise golf.
