  "text": "<h1>Lure of $1.3bn battle brings sovereign bond supremo out of retirement</h1> <p>Unlike <strong>Bill Ackman,</strong> <strong>Paul Singer</strong> and <strong>Dan Loeb, </strong>the name <strong>Jay Newman </strong>has little household recognition outside of the esoteric world of sovereign debt restructuring. </p> <p>Until recently, the 69-year-old was enjoying his retirement, split between Florida and upstate New York, after a more than four-decade career on Wall Street. And boy had he earned it. It was Newman who led <strong>Elliott Management</strong>'s battle to force the Argentine government to pay out on its defaulted debt. The 15-year struggle encompassed the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/edb12a4e-0d92-11e2-97a1-00144feabdc0\">brief capture</a> by Elliott of an Argentine naval vessel crewed by more than 200 sailors in a Ghanaian port in 2012, and the activist fund's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04896594-b506-11e3-a746-00144feabdc0\">attempted seizure</a> of satellite launch slots that Argentina had agreed with <strong>Elon Musk</strong>'s<strong> SpaceX</strong>. </p> <p>When the wager came good for Elliott in 2016 after Argentina agreed to settle the claims of “holdout” creditors, it yielded $2.4bn for the activist. And it earned a place in history as one of the greatest hedge fund trades ever. </p> <p>Meanwhile, with Newman's courtroom days behind him — or so he thought — he had been writing a thriller, <em>Undermoney</em>, with a synopsis reminiscent of an <strong>Ian Fleming</strong> yarn. The book is “an electrifying thriller about a group of American patriots who secretly take over the world's largest dark money operation with the help of a beautiful female CIA agent”, its publisher claims. </p> <p>But one siren call proved just too strong for Newman to resist. Our hedge fund correspondent <em>Laurence Fletcher </em>has the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0eb70a27-1878-4a26-a8ad-95fcc191b0f0\">inside story</a> on how he has been hired by the shareholders of <strong>Devas Multimedia</strong>, a satellite and telecoms company embroiled in a fight with the Indian government. Devas is trying to collect $1.3bn it has been awarded by international tribunals after the cancellation of a contract it had with an Indian state-owned company. But the government refuses to pay.</p> <p>“Time is on the side of creditors,” Newman tells Laurence. “Going to court isn't fun. But, if that's what it takes, we do it.” </p> <h1>Casino Royale? Inside the race to be Europe's Robinhood</h1> <p>What do banana bread, <strong>Joe Wicks</strong> and day trading have in common? All three experienced a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a51fa513-423e-4e93-9097-bef36129d0a4\">surge in favour</a> during the pandemic. And the platform of choice for the wave of Americans punting with their stimulus cheques: super-slick trading app <strong>Robinhood</strong>.</p> <p>Now the race to become the Robinhood of Europe is heating up, following its decision last summer to abandon its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/422641ff-1905-421e-b986-444ac4a6d9ee\">UK launch</a>. The contestants are split across Continental Europe. But they agree on one thing: filling the shoes of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81e9871b-5d12-480b-87a8-454b69e11958\">US meme-stock broker</a> is not the name of the game. They are keen to emphasise long-term investing over the single-stock speculation that drove the frenzy in the US.&#xa0;</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3cbfa1f-d712-46b6-8595-ebe36b6c7162\">this analysis</a> of the fledgling “Americanisation” of European share trading, my colleague <em>Joshua Oliver</em> explores how a horde of competing apps such as <strong>Trade Republic</strong>,<strong> Freetrade </strong>and<strong> Scalable Capital </strong>are drawing their battle lines. </p> <p>Their wariness of comparisons to Robinhood reflects not only the US app's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45d0a047-360f-4abf-86ee-108f436015a1\">chequered reputation</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a244aa0-70c4-45b0-bb6d-a2214fc10018\">regulatory scrutiny</a> hanging over both “gamification” of trading and payment for order flow; there is also a business argument in play. </p> <p>As <em>Madison Darbyshire</em> in New York reported recently, many Robinhood customers use the app for their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e35f869b-fd93-43f0-b9e8-43e6e2e631f1\">“fun” money</a> but keep their “real” money on a more traditional platform such as those of <strong>Fidelity</strong> or <strong>Charles Schwab</strong>. In a sector where building scale and accumulating assets is key to survival, European players want to win the long-term loyalty of the next generation of savers and undercut more expensive traditional rivals. </p> <p>“The brokerage market is not a winner-takes-all market,” says Scalable co-founder <strong>Erik Podzuweit. </strong>“I think a handful will survive, but not too many.”</p> <h1>Chart of the week</h1> <p>Europe's escalating gas supply crunch has pushed up the price of allowances linked to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1595f64-5a31-4e7b-bf98-9f5fcbb4e970\">carbon emissions</a> as energy producers switch over to cheaper but dirtier coal. EU carbon allowances last week topped €65 a tonne for the first time, and allowances under the UK's nascent cap and trade system hit a record £76 (€88) a tonne. Markets editor <em>Katie Martin</em> argues that climate change is finally <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/798acc2a-b180-4efe-8ab2-f259b7455e7a\">getting real</a> for investors. </p> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Keep it in the family</strong> An investigation by the Wall Street Journal found that 131 federal judges broke the law by hearing cases involving firms in which they or their family had a financial interest (<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/131-federal-judges-broke-the-law-by-hearing-cases-where-they-had-a-financial-interest-11632834421\">WSJ</a>)</p> <p><strong>Yin and Yang</strong> Silicon Valley venture capitalist Peter Thiel has poured millions into far-right politicians with anti-big-tech agendas.
