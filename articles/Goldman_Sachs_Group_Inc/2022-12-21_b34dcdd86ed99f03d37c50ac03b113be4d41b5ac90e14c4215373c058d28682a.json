  "text": "<p>The discrepancies were earlier reported by the New York Times.</p><p>Representatives for Mr. Santos deferred questions to his attorney, Joseph Murray, who didn't respond to a message seeking comment. In a statementposted to Mr. Santos's campaign account Monday, Mr. Murray said the candidate was weathering a \"shotgun blast of attacks.\"</p><p>Democrats said the discrepancies, as well as additional questions about Mr. Santos's finances, should be looked at before Mr. Santos is seated. \"There are so many red flags,\" New York State Democratic Committee Chairman Jay Jacobs said.</p><p>While many Washington Republicans have been silent on the matter in recent days, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, at least one Long Island Republican has said Mr. Santos should address the matter.</p><p>Nassau County Republican Chairman Joseph Cairo said the discrepancies were serious. \"Every person deserves an opportunity to 'clear' his/her name in the face of accusations. I am committed to this principle, and I look forward to the congressman-elect's responses,\" Mr. Cairo said.</p><p>Republicans next year will hold a narrow 222-212 majority in the House with one vacancy. Mr. Santos backed Mr. McCarthy for speaker. Mr. McCarthy can't lose more than four from his conference, if all Democrats back their leadership, as they traditionally do.</p><p>A representative for the California Republican didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Santos last month defeated Robert Zimmerman, a Democratic National Committee member, by 8 percentage points. The district includes the North Shore of Nassau County as well as parts of Queens and Suffolk County. Incumbent Democrat Tom Suozzi didn't seek re-election; he unsuccessfully ran for governor.</p><p>Mr. Santos lost handily when he challenged Mr. Suozzi in 2020. His election this year against Mr. Zimmerman drew some national attention because both men are gay, and Mr. Santos is the first openly gay person elected to Congress from Long Island.</p><p>On Tuesday, fellow New York Rep.-elect Dan Goldman, a Democrat and former federal prosecutor who was counsel to the impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump, called on the FBI to investigate possible campaign lies and false statements in disclosure filings.</p><p>One outside watchdog group also raised concerns about a spike in Mr. Santos's finances. At the time of his 2020 campaign, Mr. Santos disclosed no major assets, according to a filing with the House Clerk, and listed a commission bonus from LinkBridge Investors as the only compensation over $5,000.</p><p>In September of 2022, his disclosure filing said he was the managing principal of the Devolder Organization, which is described as a consulting firm that incorporates one of Mr. Santos's family names, and was valued at between $1 million and $5 million. He also declared an apartment in Rio de Janeiro worth up to $1 million and checking and savings accounts totaling at least $1.1 million, which weren't listed in 2020.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think of the questions raised about George Santos's record? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Mr. Santos listed at least $3.5 million of income earned from the firm in 2021 and 2022.</p><p>\"When you have somebody who had almost no assets and now suddenly has millions—the question is, who does he owe allegiance to?\" said Susan Lerner, executive director of the government-watchdog group Common Cause New York.</p><p>Mr. Murray, the attorney for Mr. Santos, didn't respond to questions about the Devolder Organization.</p><p>Mr. Zimmerman said in an interview that he and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee tried to raise questions about Mr. Santos's biography to reporters before Election Day. \"In a midterm election of 435 congressional races and a governor's race dominating the attention, it was very difficult to break through,\" he said.</p><p>Natalie Andrews contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jimmy Vielkind at Jimmy.Vielkind@wsj.com</p><p>George Santos Was Just Elected to Congress.
