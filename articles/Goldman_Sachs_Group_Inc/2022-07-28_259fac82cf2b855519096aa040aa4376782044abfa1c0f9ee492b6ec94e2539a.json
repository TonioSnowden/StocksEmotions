  "text": "<p>The provision \"reflects a reduction in the market value of the structured notes and additional accrued interest that would be payable to investors on rescission,\" it said in a statement.</p><p>The unusual incident at Barclays has been a significant speed bump for new chief executive C.S. Venkatakrishnan, who took over from Jes Staley in the top job in November, and has raised questions over its internal controls.</p><p>Venkatakrishnan described the trading blunder as \"disappointing\" and said the bank has worked to improve its internal controls, commissioning an external review into the incident.</p><p>The hit marred an otherwise strong quarter for Barclays's corporate and investment bank, with fixed income, currencies and commodities trading surging by 71% to £2bn, and its stock trading unit up by 82% to £1.4bn.</p><p>Overall pre-tax profit within its corporate and investment bank was down 48% to £784m for the second quarter, with a drop in dealmaking fees also hitting the unit. However, before the £1.3bn in provisions for the trading error, Barclays's CIB revenue was up 35% to £4bn.</p><p>The bank will also pay $200m for an expected penalty from the US regulators for how its staff have used mobile devices. Banks have taken a hit from a regulatory investigation into the use of communication tools and client communication over social media platforms such as WhatsApp, with total charges across the sector expected to hit $1bn.</p><p>Across the bank, net profit was down 48% to £1.1bn in the second quarter, which was above market expectations, while revenue of £6.7bn also exceeded analyst predictions.</p><p>Barclays made £554m from investment banking fees during the second quarter, a decline of 37% which was a smaller drop than most of its major rivals. Equity capital markets revenue, which has slumped over the course of this year, was down 84% to just £37m.</p><p>Dealmaking fees have slowed at most investment banks during the second quarter, with revenue at Wall Street banks JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declining by around 55% and by 41% at Goldman Sachs. UBS's investment banking fees fell by 57% for the period while Swiss rival Credit Suisse's dealmaking fees tumbled by 78%.</p><p>The $130bn deal boom of 2021 has ebbed away so far this year, as surging inflation and other economic fears have hit M&amp;A and volatile markets have dried up equity deals and gridlocked financing for large transactions.</p><p>Barclays has continued to hire senior dealmakers as it eyes market share gains, according to senior dealmakers. It recently took on Arif Vohra as co-head of its financial institutions group in Europe from Bank of America, and Enrico Massaro as head of the consumer and retail group for the region.</p><p>However, it has also lost key bankers including Yann Krychowski, its co-head of investment banking in France, who is joining boutique Centerview and Nacho Moreno, who led its investment bank in Spain and switched to Credit Suisse.</p><p>The UK lender ranks sixth by investment banking fees so far in 2022, at $1.6bn, according to data provider Dealogic, up from seventh at the same point last year having leapfrogged Credit Suisse.</p><p>This story originally appeared at FNLondon.com</p><p>Barclays sets aside $1.6 billion for trading blunder</p>",
