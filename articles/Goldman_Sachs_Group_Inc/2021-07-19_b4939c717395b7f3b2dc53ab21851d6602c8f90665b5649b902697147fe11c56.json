  "text": "<p>Bill Ackman's special purpose acquisition company has abandoned plans to buy a $4bn stake in Universal Music Group after a backlash from regulators and investors.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The acquisition of a 10 per cent stake in Universal Music, home to artists such as Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga, will instead be done by the billionaire's Pershing Square hedge fund.&#xa0;</p> <p>The restructuring marks the end of Ackman's efforts&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d77d9883-6b01-4458-9180-8579aa4d346f\">to strike a first-of-its-kind deal</a>&#xa0;through his Spac, Pershing Square Tontine Holdings, after it agreed last month to buy the stake from Vivendi, Universal Music's owner.&#xa0;</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://pershingsquareholdings.com/pershing-square-holdings-ltd-provides-update-to-investors-3/\">letter to PSTH investors on Monday</a>, Ackman blamed problems that regulators at the US Securities and Exchange Commission had with the unconventional structure of the Spac deal.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Our decision to seek an alternative initial business combination (IBC) was driven by issues raised by the SEC with several elements of the proposed transaction — in particular, whether the structure of our IBC qualified under the NYSE rules,” Pershing said. </p> <p>Spacs raise money from investors through a public listing and typically seek to combine with a private company through a merger. However, the deal between Ackman's PSTH and Universal Music broke that mould. Rather than merging with the label, PSTH investors would have become shareholders in Universal Music ahead of its listing later this year.&#xa0;</p> <p>In an interview with the Financial Times, Ackman said PSTH had tried to address concerns by the Wall Street regulator about the deal, including that the transaction could result in an unregistered investment company rather than a Spac, but ultimately its proposals bore no fruit. </p> <p>“They raised a whole bunch of objections over time, all of which we thought we could manage until they raised that this is not a good business combination, and then we were done,” he said. <strong><br><br></strong>One of PSTH's suggestions — to create a trust that would hold the Universal Music shares for investors until they were registered with the SEC in September — would have potentially left short-term shareholders unhappy because their investment would be illiquid for four months.<strong><br><br></strong>In his letter, Ackman acknowledged that he underestimated the negative reaction from PSTH investors to the deal's complexity and structure.</p> <p>“We also underestimated the transaction's potential impact on investors who are unable to hold foreign securities, who margin their shares or who own call options on our stock,” he wrote. </p> <p>Shares in PSTH, which have dropped 18 per cent since the deal was announced in early June, were flat in early New York trading. PSTH now has 18 months to complete a new transaction and Ackman added that he would pursue only conventional Spac deals.</p> <p>In a separate statement, Vivendi confirmed the change and said Pershing Square would still buy a 5 to 10 per cent equity stake. If it is less than 10 per cent, it will offer the rest for sale to shareholders before Universal Music is hived off into a standalone <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fff7048b-1c0d-45a8-ad5b-ff277d34097f\">company</a> in September.</p> <p>Vivendi had planned the sale of a last slice of Universal Music, the world's biggest music label and its most profitable business, as a way to bring in cash ahead of the separation. It has already sold 20 per cent of Universal Music to a consortium controlled by China's Tencent. </p> <p>The carve-out will be done via a distribution in kind, in which existing shareholders of Vivendi will become shareholders in the new company, recently valued at €35bn and to be listed in Amsterdam. </p> <p>Activist investors such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eabf7d93-32fe-42cd-a0ac-71665380a0a4\">Bluebell Capital</a> had pushed Vivendi to tweak the conditions of the Universal Music separation in a public campaign but had stopped short of agitating to stop it. Vivendi won overwhelming support for the move at a shareholder vote <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/20ae2427-0944-487c-aac0-99286f6c438f\">in June</a>.<br><br>The value of music companies has soared in recent years as streaming services such as Spotify revived the industry, reaping billions in royalty payments to music labels. </p> <p>The industry's “big three” labels — market leader Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Music — control almost 80 per cent of the market, which is forecast to more than double by 2030 to reach $45bn, according to Goldman Sachs.&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Arash Massoudi and Oliver Ralph in London, Ortenca Aliaj in New York and Leila Abboud in Paris 2021 'Bill Ackman abandons Spac plan to take $4bn stake in Universal Music' FT.com 19 July.
