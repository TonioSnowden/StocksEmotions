The news put pressure on other shipping stocks and dented overall investor sentiment, analysts said, as FedEx CEO Raj Subramaniam, told CNBC late Thursday that the global economy was likely headed for a recession.</p><p>Stock in rival UPS Inc. UPS slid 6%, while retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. AMZN and Target Corp. TGT were also lower. FedEx's gloom spread overseas with Deutsche Post AG XE:DPW and Royal Mail PLC UK:RMG both tumbling.</p><p>Read: 'Simply staggering.' FedEx hit with downgrades, price target cuts as warning shocks Wall Street.</p><p>\"The fact that FedEx expects the US economy to enter into a recession has made traders trade carefully, and there aren't many who are willing to buy the market,\" said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, in a note to clients.</p><p>\"It is highly likely that we will see a similar message from other companies in the coming days as well, and that may make the overall sentiment even more adverse. The fact is that more and more CEOs are feeling pessimistic about the global economy, and this may not be the best environment for global markets to do well,\" Aslam.</p><p>Need to Know: A further 27% drop in the S&amp;P 500 could be coming if inflation hawks are right, Goldman Sachs team warns</p><p>Another blow came from General Electric Co.

Some forecasts are even calling for a 100 basis-point rate hike next week.</p><p>Thursday's data was a mixed bag with U.S. retail sales and weekly jobless claims offering signs that the economy is still holding steady, though two regional gauges of manufacturing slightly contracted.</p><p>The only data on tap Friday is the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, due at 10 a.m. Eastern, with the report's inflation expectations reading set to be closely eyed.</p><p>Technology stocks were again expected to lead the way south on Friday, as the two-year Treasury yield continued to trade more than 40 basis points above that of the 10-year yield. That so-called inversion often suggests market participants are expecting an economic slowdown.</p><p>The yield on the 2-year Treasury note was setfor a seventh straight rise on Friday, a day after reaching its highest level since October 2007. The 2-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD02Y was last up 4 basis points to 3.901%, while the 10-year yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Ywas up 1 basis point to 3.465%.</p><p>Jittery investors continued to push the dollar DXY higher, with the British pound GBPUSD dropping below $1.14 for the first time in 37 years. The currency's weakness was exacerbated by weaker-than-expected retail sales data.</p><p>U.S. stock futures slide as FedEx warning rattles investors</p>",
