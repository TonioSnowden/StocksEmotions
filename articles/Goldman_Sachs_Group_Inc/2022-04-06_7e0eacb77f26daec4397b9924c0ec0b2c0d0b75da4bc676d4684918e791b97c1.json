  "title": "Salad Days are Over for Asian Tech—and Not Just in China; Sea Ltd, Southeast Asia's largest internet firm, has pulled out of India's e-commerce market as it seeks to prioritize profits over growth",
  "text": "<p>Singapore based Sea Ltd, the parent of popular game \"Free Fire,\" pulled its e-commerce business Shopee out of India last week: closing its doors on a market that is expected to see 291.2 million shoppers spending $85.5 billion on online retail by 2025, according to Forrester Research. The decision was met with a sigh of relief from analysts—who believe Sea must control expanding e-commerce losses. Sea's New York-listed shares are down about 66% from their October peak, when the company's market capitalization was above $200 billion. Shopee accounts for about half of Sea's revenue, with gaming and financial services making up the rest.</p><p>Sea, which is also battling Grab and Indonesia's GoTo for control of its home Southeast Asian market, has turned cautious on capital spending in the face of its weakening gaming business—a cash cow that turbocharged the expansion of lossmaking Shopee. Shopee is now the reigning e-commerce champion in Southeast Asia. But total bookings for its gaming business, a metric the company employs to estimate cash spent by users, are expected to be down 35% in 2022. The company no longer has a font of easy cash to burn on hypercompetitive markets like India.</p><p>Instead, it is betting on smaller but more profitable markets like Brazil. The crowded Indian online retail market isn't for the faint of heart: It is price-sensitive, defined by deals and discounts, and requires substantial cash investments to make a dent. Shopee was in India for less than six months. Meanwhile, Walmart-owned Flipkart, Reliance Industries, Amazon, and Tata Group collectively control more than 80% of the Indian market, Forrester Research estimates. Shopee has also made some other tactical withdrawals recently: Shopee's India exit, which it blamed on \"global market uncertainties,\" comes a month after it departed France.</p><p>Perceptions of regulatory unfriendliness might also have played a role. Though the company says the developments are unrelated, Shopee's exit from India followed a ban of its hit game \"Free Fire\" by the Indian government amid a clampdown on Chinese apps. Tencent is one of Sea's large shareholders.</p><p>The company itself is starting to emphasize broad-based profitability more explicitly: Sea sees Shopee in Southeast Asia and Taiwan becoming profitable on an adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization basis before allocation of headquarter costs during this year, and to self-fund growth by 2025. Analysts, meanwhile, are largely happy to see it depart India. Morgan Stanley sees the move as \"a clear positive,\" saying Shopee struggled to make underlying unit economics work due partly to low average order values and high logistics costs. Goldman Sachs also gave the move the thumbs up, saying it would boost profitability.</p><p>Sea probably won't be the last emerging Asian tech firm that will have to start picking its battles much more carefully in the months ahead—particularly if the dollar keeps rising and the global economic picture keeps weakening.</p><p>Write to Megha Mandavia at megha.mandavia@wsj.com</p><p>Salad Days are Over for Asian Tech—and Not Just in China</p>",
