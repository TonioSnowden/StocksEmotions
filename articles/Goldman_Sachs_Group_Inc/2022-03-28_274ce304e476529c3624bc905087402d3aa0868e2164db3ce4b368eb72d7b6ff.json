  "text": "<p>The swing in Chinese technology stocks in the past few weeks has been phenomenal. The Kraneshares CSI China Internet exchange-traded fund, which tracks offshore Chinese technology listings, had its worst week ever for the week ended March 11, logging a 19% drop. Then it rebounded 29% the week after—its best ever weekly performance.</p><p>The key turning point was a supportive message from a meeting of top policy makers, chaired by China's economic czar Liu He. Though there were no concrete policies announced, the tone was music to investors' ears, especially the bit specifying that any policy that could affect the market should be coordinated with financial regulators first. Soothing language on the overall regulatory crackdown and regarding the delisting risks faced by U.S-listed Chinese companies also helped.</p><p>All of this is a signal that policy makers probably don't want to see the market go lower—definitely not in the stomach-churning fashion that preceded the abrupt turnaround. Economic stability is a policy priority in 2022 given that President Xi Jinping will likely seek a precedent-breaking third term at the Communist Party's head this fall. It helps that Chinese stocks are already trading at historically cheap levels. The Hang Seng Index is trading at 8.6 times forward earnings, compared with a 10-year average of 10.3, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>Stock buybacks might also provide support in the coming months. Alibaba increased its share-buyback program to $25 billion from $15 billion last week. That is roughly equivalent to 8% of its market value. Smartphone maker Xiaomi said last week it would buy up to $1.3 billion of its own shares. Goldman Sachs said the cash-to-market capitalization ratio has reached a record high of 23% for companies in the MSCI China index, excluding financials.</p><p>But in the long run, the fundamentals of the consumer internet business may indeed have shifted. Alibaba and Tencent both reported the slowest growth since they went public in their most recent earnings reports. In other words, the sort of enormous cash generation that can fund big buybacks in the future might get trickier. For now, investors seem to still be pricing in a less rosy future: Even after the recent rebound, many Chinese technology stocks are still worth less than half what they were at their peak.</p><p>The market probably has found a bottom for the near term. Returning to the glory days is a different matter.</p><p>Write to Jacky Wong at jacky.wong@wsj.com</p><p>Chinese Tech Stocks Are Back. Their Glory Days Aren't.</p>",
