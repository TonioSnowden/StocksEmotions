  "text": "<p>FBI agents searched former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Fla., on Monday, which people familiar with the matter said was part of an investigation into Mr. Trump's handling of classified information...</p><p>Legal historians said they couldn't remember a case in recent history in which the FBI searched the home of a former president. The search marked an escalation of the Justice Department's investigation into aspects of Mr. Trump's final days in office and is expected to ripple through the run-up to November's midterm elections.</p><p>Officials can face up to five years in prison for removing classified materials to an unauthorized location.</p><p>One reason no one can remember such a case is because a President, acting under his Article II constitutional powers as commander in chief, is the authority on what material in the executive branch is classified and what is not classified. He can make such determinations up until the moment he leaves office.</p><p>Some have suggested a double standard in that the FBI just seized documents from Mr. Trump's home, but in 2016 exonerated Hillary Clinton on her handling of classified materials and her use of a home server without even giving Justice prosecutors a chance to do their lawful duty to determine whether charges should be brought. There's the additional issue that Mrs. Clinton had been only a cabinet secretary and any limited authority she had over classifications would have been delegated by the president.</p><p>Over at the New York Times Maggie Haberman, Ben Protess and Adam Goldman helpfully note:</p><p>The law governing the preservation of White House materials, the Presidential Records Act, lacks teeth, but criminal statutes can come into play, especially in the case of classified material.</p><p>Criminal codes, which carry jail time, can be used to prosecute anyone who \"willfully injures or commits any depredation against any property of the United States\" and anyone who \"willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates or destroys\" government documents.</p><p>Samuel R. Berger, a national security adviser to President Bill Clinton, pleaded guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge for removing classified material from a government archive.</p><p>Well, he didn't just remove them. A 2015 obituary in the Washington Post noted:</p><p>By most accounts, Mr. Berger made repeated trips to the National Archives to refresh his memory about the Clinton national security team's work to foil a bin Laden plot. He was caught smuggling out a handful of sensitive documents, destroying some at his office and lying about possessing them.</p><p>Was Berger concerned that Team Clinton's \"work to foil\" bin Laden wouldn't appear especially diligent with the benefit of hindsight? Regardless, smuggling, destroying and then lying about documents related to an issue of eminent importance to national security resulted in a misdemeanor plea for the Clinton loyalist.</p><p>As for this week's FBI visit to Mar-a-Lago, Justice would first have needed to persuade a judge of probable cause that evidence of a crime might be found at Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>But the sad recent history of the FBI shows that the bureau is prone to mislead judges on issues related to Mr. Trump, and the judiciary is not especially offended by such falsehoods.</p><p>This column noted in January of 2021:</p><p>The government employees of the \"resistance\" who never accepted Donald Trump as our president have finally performed a useful public service. Together with the judges of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, they have demonstrated for all Americans how easy it is to turn the spying tools of the federal government against domestic political opponents.</p><p>Even after the Obama-appointed inspector general of the Department of Justice found \"at least 17 significant errors or omissions\" in a series of approved surveillance warrant applications to spy on Trump associate Carter Page—and even after a criminal conviction of an FBI attorney for doctoring an email to make it appear that the patriotic Mr. Page had never assisted U.S. intelligence—... judges are still refusing to apply any significant punishment to the government officials who misled them.</p><p>Matt Zapotosky of the Washington Post reported that day on the FBI's Kevin Clinesmith:</p><p>The former FBI lawyer who admitted to doctoring an email that other officials relied upon to justify secret surveillance of a former Trump campaign adviser was sentenced Friday to 12 months of probation, with no time behind bars.</p><p>As if it wasn't bad enough to offer such a light punishment for a crime that went right to the heart of our democratic process, the disgraceful U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia James Boasberg actually expressed sympathy for the offender. The Journal's Byron Tau reported:</p><p>\"Mr. Clinesmith has lost his job in government service—what has given his life much of its meaning,\" said Judge Boasberg.</p><p>This column observed:</p><p>The judge responsible for punishing an attorney who helped the FBI abuse its powers to target a political campaign and then a presidency with a collusion hoax that poisoned our politics for years is concerned about the criminal's personal search for meaning? Instead of community service, perhaps Judge Boasberg should have just ordered Clinesmith to live, laugh and love.</p><p>Just like every other American, Donald Trump has rights. And given recent history the FBI deserves no presumption of innocence.</p><p>***</p><p>James Freeman is the co-author of \"The Cost: Trump, China and American Revival.\"</p><p>***</p><p>Follow James Freeman on Twitter.</p><p>Subscribe to the Best of the Web email.</p><p>To suggest items, please email best@wsj.com.</p><p>(Teresa Vozzo helps compile Best of the Web.)</p><p>The FBI, the Judiciary and Trump</p>",
