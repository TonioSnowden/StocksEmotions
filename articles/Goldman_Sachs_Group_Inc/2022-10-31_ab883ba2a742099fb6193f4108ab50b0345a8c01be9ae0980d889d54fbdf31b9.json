  "title": "U.S. Stocks Fall With Focus on Fed; Central-bank officials are expected to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point Wednesday",
  "text": "<p>Traders are shuffling their holdings ahead of Wednesday, when traders think Fed officials are almost certain to raise interest rates by another 0.75 percentage point. The focus will be on remarks by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, which could bring clues about whether the Fed may slow the size and pace of rate increases, or continue strong efforts to tame rising prices.</p><p>For most of the year, the Fed's fastest interest-rate increases since the 1980s have battered markets, but signs of moderation in October helped propel stocks toward monthly gains. The Dow gained about 14% this month, its best monthly result since 1976. In October speeches, some Fed officials said they are considering whether their December meeting should bring a slower pace of tightening as the central bank tries to balance controlling inflation and avoiding a sharp economic contraction.</p><p>Specifically, investors want to know if December will yield yet another 0.75-percentage-point rate increase, or whether the Fed will downshift to a half-percentage-point move. Bets in futures markets show that traders see roughly even odds of either outcome, according to CME Group.</p><p>\"I'm anticipating hearing Powell walking a fine line, trying to point out some of the positive data without the market taking it as a full-blown pivot,\" Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said of his expectations for Mr. Powell's remarks Wednesday.</p><p>Whatever the size of December's move, economists caution that high inflation—still at an 8.2% annual rate in September—will keep the Fed on track to bring rates up well into next year. Over the weekend, economists at Goldman Sachs raised their estimate of how high the Fed's target interest rate will eventually climb, forecasting rate increases through March. The bank now expects the Fed's target to reach 4.75% to 5% next year, up from the current range of 3% to 3.25%.</p><p>The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which closely tracks monetary-policy expectations, rose to 4.499%, from 4.422% on Friday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 4.074% from 4.009% Friday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>Investors are also poring over third-quarter earnings, which have helped boost some companies such as United Airlines and JPMorgan, whose reportsshowed resilience in a turbulent economy. Some major tech companies such as Microsoft, on the other hand, have seen selloffs after posting lackluster results. This week, nearly a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies will post their latest figures.</p><p>In 4 p.m. trading, tech stocks were among the companies that led the S&amp;P 500's losses. Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, lost 6.1%, continuing last week's slide that followed a disappointing earnings report. Apple shares fell 1.5% as Foxconn, a major contributor to Apple's iPhone production, struggled with a Covid-19 outbreak at a factory in China.</p><p>With more rate rises on the horizon, it is difficult to take much comfort in the stock market's October rally, said Paul Eitelman, chief investment strategist for North America at Russell Investments. Russell has avoided buying into stock-market dips this year, cautious about how an economic downturn could bring further losses.</p><p>\"I think there's still critical issues that we need to get through as global equities investors in the months ahead,\" Mr. Eitelman said. \"Until the labor market slows down, U.S. monetary policy is going to be a headwind for markets going forward.\"</p><p>Chicago wheat futures rose 6.4% to $8.83 a bushel after Russia said it would suspend participation in the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports. If shipments of Ukrainian grain are halted, the suspension will likely drive up the global price of wheat, corn and other vital food products. Corn rose 1.6% to $6.20 a bushel.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, fell 1% to $94.83 a barrel. Overall, oil climbed 7.8% in October, the first month of price gains since May.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.3% Monday, contributing to a 6.3% rise in October.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes closed with mixed performances. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.8% and South Korea's Kospi added 1.1%. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.2% and China's Shanghai Composite fell 0.8%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Fall With Focus on Fed</p>",
