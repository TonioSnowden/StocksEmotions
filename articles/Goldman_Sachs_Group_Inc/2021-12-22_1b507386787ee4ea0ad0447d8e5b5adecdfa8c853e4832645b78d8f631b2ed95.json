  "title": "Pandemic Fuels West Palm Beach Office Market",
  "text": "<p>The two projects and two other Related developments are set to increase the total office space in the city's central business district by more than 50% to 4.3 million square feet, from 2.8 million square feet last year, according to data from CBRE Group Inc.</p><p>West Palm Beach has long been overshadowed by the richer and more famous Palm Beach to the east. It never had much office space, partly because finance professionals visited only on weekends or for a few weeks during the winter, returning to their New York offices by the spring. \"You came here in the summer and it was a different market than the winter,\" said Related's chairman, Stephen Ross.</p><p>The pandemic is starting to change that. With their offices closed for months, many finance professionals moved to South Florida to work remotely. Meanwhile, the pandemic pushed more companies to rethink their office strategy and open outposts in places where taxes and housing costs are lower, such as Florida. West Palm Beach is also benefiting from a new rail line to downtown Miami that opened in 2018.</p><p>\"People can telecommute now and it's more widely acceptable,\" said John Criddle, an executive vice president at CBRE. He said he has never seen the leasing market this busy and expects the city's office sector to double over the next few years.</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and investment firm Elliott Management Corp. have signed leases at a recently completed Related development in West Palm Beach. Gopal Rajegowda, a partner at Related, said that 75% of the West Palm Beach office space it leased out over the past 18 months went to companies new to the city.</p><p>Florida overall has benefited from business relocations during the pandemic. Miami has been attracting both financial and technology companies from high-tax states like New York and California.</p><p>New York-based Related, best known for developing the Hudson Yards neighborhood in Manhattan, has a long history of building in South Florida and has been active in West Palm Beach for decades. Mr. Ross is also the owner of the Miami Dolphins football team.</p><p>Related's two new West Palm Beach projects, designed by Arquitectonica and Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, would span around 450,000 square feet each and include offices, retail space and a theater. The company is applying for a rezoning to build the projects and, if successful, plans to complete them in three years.</p><p>Related is also developing a 25-story office tower designed by David Childs, and it bought three West Palm Beach office properties and two senior-housing projects this year, cementing its position as the dominant private landlord in the city center. The firm would control close to 4 million square feet of real estate -- including nearly 2.5 million square feet of office space -- in West Palm Beach once the two latest projects are completed.</p><p>Mr. Ross traced the growing demand for office space in West Palm Beach to the early months of the pandemic. \"People came down here and stayed until sometime in June, July before they went north again, and they saw what Florida was like during those months,\" he said. \"I think that opened up a whole dynamic that didn't exist before.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
