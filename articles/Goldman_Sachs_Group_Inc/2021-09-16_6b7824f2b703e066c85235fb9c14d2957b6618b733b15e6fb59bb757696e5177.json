  "text": "<p><strong>One wild thing in German banking to start</strong>: Deutsche Bank has pulled a research report accusing German financial regulators and the country's outgoing conservative-led government of serious failures less than two weeks ahead of the hotly contested federal election. Here's our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a81640b2-5f75-49b2-bb87-f09b99162f7c\">must read story</a> from Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt.</p> <h2>Choo-choo: Canadian Pacific deal with Kansas City Southern is back on track</h2> <p>Six months ago the Financial Times revealed that <strong>Canadian Pacific</strong> had agreed to acquire <strong>Kansas City Southern</strong>, the first major railway merger in two decades.&#xa0;</p> <p>On Wednesday the two companies renewed their vows. What happened in between was one of the most riveting takeover battles in recent memory.&#xa0;</p> <p>It pitted CP and its larger rival <strong>Canadian National</strong> against each other to secure an asset that will create the first ever end-to-end railway line connecting Canada to Mexico through the US. Here's a quick recap.&#xa0;</p> <p>On March 21 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d4c383a-b3ee-415d-beaf-3cc7a6dc5993\">CP announced</a> it had reached an agreement to buy KCS for $275 a share, comprising $90 in cash and the remainder in CP stock, valuing the US railroad at about $29bn including debt.&#xa0;</p> <p>KCS's board had a change of heart less than two month later. On May 13 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5643aa9-bd39-48b0-9591-8a93e34c7065\">CN successfully gatecrashed</a> the deal with a cash-and-stock offer worth $320 a share, valuing the company at about $34bn including debt.&#xa0;</p> <p>At this point, you'd think that the only way CP could make a comeback was with a bid higher than CN's. That didn't happen. Why? All along, CP was convinced that theirs was the only deal that could obtain regulatory approval.</p> <p>CP's strategy to wait on the sidelines worked.&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e4b10ce-5769-4206-a6e0-dfb3cbb3a357\">On August 31</a>, the <strong>US Surface Transportation Board </strong><a href=\"https://prod.stb.gov/news-communications/latest-news/pr-21-37/\">rejected</a> CN's request to create a temporary voting trust, a key component in how the deal was structured because it would've allowed KCS shareholders to get paid before receiving full regulatory approval.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>That was the turning point.&#xa0;</p> <p>The message from the regulator was clear: CN's deal with KCS, which would have created the third-largest US railway operator, held the potential to harm the public interest. Game over.&#xa0;</p> <p>Before the STB made its views known, CP sweetened its old offer, increasing it to $300 a share.&#xa0;</p> <p>It was a tactical move to facilitate a swift re-engagement with KCS, especially since a CP-KCS merger would not face much regulatory push back as it would create the smallest out of six rail operators in North America.</p> <p>That's exactly what happened <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e217acc-95fe-4037-975a-2786ca490c79\">on Wednesday</a>. KCS terminated its deal with CN and announced its new combination with CP.&#xa0;</p> <p>For its trouble CN is walking away with $1.4bn in pay-offs. But it now faces a revolt from one of its biggest shareholders, <strong>TCI</strong>'s<strong> Chris Hohn,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.tcifund.com/files/corporateengageement/canadiannationalrailway/TCI%20-%20Board%20Nominees%20Special%20Meeting.pdf\">is seeking to overthrow</a> its leadership and some of its board.&#xa0;</p> <h2>GreenSky: David Solomon and the circle of life</h2> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> chief <strong>David Solomon</strong> is on a dealmaking spree.&#xa0;</p> <p>Just weeks after snapping up <strong>NN Investment Partners</strong>, the investment management arm of the Dutch insurer <strong>NN Group</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd064398-2030-4260-84e3-f442d42cd2d1\">for €1.6bn</a>, he has struck another multibillion-dollar acquisition.&#xa0;</p> <p>Goldman said on Wednesday it has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9897043-cde9-491a-8417-831bf3b89002#comments-anchor\">agreed to buy</a> <strong>GreenSky</strong>, the online loans provider, for $2.2bn.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The deal comes as the US investment bank tries to entrench itself in the consumer lending business, a key profit driver for Wall Street rivals including <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>.</p> <p>Goldman launched its own online lending platform in 2016, which has had <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-tries-banking-for-the-masses-its-been-a-struggle-11569643252\">its own issues</a>, as reported by The Wall Street Journal.&#xa0;</p> <p>Named after Goldman's founder, Marcus emerged on the scene during the marketplace lending boom when companies such as <strong>Lending Club</strong> and <strong>OnDeck </strong>promised to disrupt traditional lenders by facilitating loans to borrowers through online platforms.&#xa0;</p> <p>The money mostly came from external financing, however, often from the very institutions they were trying to displace.&#xa0;</p> <p>GreenSky is no exception. The company, which offers “buy now, pay later” services, relies on funding partners such as banks for its loans. It services a $9bn portfolio but has struggled to achieve the success of some of its peers in the sector.</p> <p>Before the announcement of the deal, GreenSky shares were down 70 per cent from their $23 initial public offering price in 2018.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Atlanta-based company has also been criticised for its lending practices with <strong>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau </strong>handing GreenSky a <a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-takes-action-against-fintech-company-greensky-for-enabling-merchants-to-secure-loans-for-consumers-without-their-authorization/\">$2.5m fine</a> in July for enabling merchants to take out loans on behalf of consumers without their knowledge.&#xa0;</p> <p>GreenSky and Goldman <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12af3b94-e774-11e8-8a85-04b8afea6ea3\">are no strangers</a>, of course.&#xa0;</p> <p>The investment bank took the lead role in its IPO, splitting about $50m in fees. Months later, when GreenSky shares had declined by more than two-thirds, Goldman was forced to admit that it had been “wrong” about the company and downgraded GreenSky's 12-month price target from $31 to $11.</p> <p>Now Goldman has snapped it up for $12.11 a share, to be paid in Goldman stock.&#xa0;</p> <p>So goes the circle of life on Wall Street.&#xa0;</p> <h2>When things get hostile in Tokyo</h2> <p>Last week the man who probably ranks as Japan's most flamboyant and certainly most outspoken banker, <strong>Yoshitaka Kitao</strong>, caught Japan's buttoned-up financial sector by surprise.</p> <p>Kitao's online brokerage <strong>SBI</strong> launched <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a863d9d-b081-4a9e-99d7-dbcd828aab75\">an unsolicited tender offer</a> that would more than double its existing stake in <strong>Shinsei Bank </strong>to 48 per cent.&#xa0;</p> <p>That would have been bold enough on its own, writes the FT's Leo Lewis from Tokyo.&#xa0;</p> <p>But Kitao also wants to oust the Shinsei board and replace it with one of his own suggestion. That's aggressive stuff to throw at a company with which, until very recently, SBI was hoping to secure deeper business ties.&#xa0;</p> <p>The FT has been tracking for some time the gradual <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb484545-31d4-451c-838b-4f2b14a298b4\">establishment of hostile deals</a> into the mainstream of Japanese dealmaking, but this fight seems more likely than others to become a landmark.</p> <p>The fun really began on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d71381fd-cb63-4841-a28a-59fd70942535\">when the FT broke the news</a> that Shinsei had engaged <strong>Morgan Stanley </strong>as an adviser on takeover defence strategies, and that the tactic currently under discussion was a “poison pill” that could in theory see Shinsei offering heavily dilutive stock acquisition rights.&#xa0;</p> <p>The reality, though, is that Shinsei's plan is primarily about buying time: the poison pill would have to be voted on by shareholders at an extraordinary meeting, which would require a two-thirds majority of its investors to approve.&#xa0;</p> <p>SBI's 20 per cent stake makes that bar almost impossibly high, but it does at least mean that everything — including SBI's tender offer — goes into limbo for some months.&#xa0;</p> <p>Plenty of time for Shinsei to come up either with alternative bidders or to sit down again with SBI and discuss closer business ties on friendlier terms. </p> <p>Whatever happens, precedents will be set and the entire market is watching this one very closely indeed.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>DD exclusive: <strong>PJT Partners </strong>has hired the veteran European dealmaker <strong>René Proglio</strong> as a partner in its advisory group based in Paris. Proglio left <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> in May after 17 years, most recently serving as a vice-chair and country head for France. Before joining Morgan Stanley, Proglio was a partner at<strong> Arthur Andersen </strong>where he spent 20 years.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Rothschild</strong> has appointed the former UK cabinet secretary <strong>Mark Sedwill</strong> to its supervisory board. He will replace <strong>Anthony de Rothschild</strong>.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Les Wood</strong>, who has been chief financial officer of<strong> Tullow Oil </strong>since 2017, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/33005a51-0ac1-4760-aa15-4c9c6f70728a\">will step down</a> at the end of March.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Robert Stebbins</strong>, former general counsel for the US Securities and Exchange Commission, has rejoined <strong>Willkie Farr </strong>as a partner in New York, where he will head the firm's corporate governance practice.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Houlihan Lokey</strong> has hired <strong>Stephen Lee </strong>as a managing director and head of its technology and cyber security practice. He joins in Chicago from <strong>KPMG</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>PayPals </strong>India's Paytm was supposed to be the country's digital payments darling with the ambition to rival Ant Group's Alipay.
