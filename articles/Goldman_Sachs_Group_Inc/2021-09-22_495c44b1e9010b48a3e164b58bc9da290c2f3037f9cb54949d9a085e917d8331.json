  "text": "<p>Last week, Byju's agreed to purchase Los Altos, Calif.-based coding platform Neuron Fuel Inc., which does business as Tynker, for an undisclosed amount. The deal followed the acquisition of Redwood City, Calif.-based reading platform Epic Creations Inc. for $500 million in July.</p><p>The summer deals bring Byju's closer to its goal of investing $1 billion in the U.S. ed-tech market, co-founder and chief executive Byju Raveendran said. Tynker and Epic have collectively been used by 110 million children worldwide and bolster Byju's' offering for its core age group.</p><p>The ed-tech industry has been on a tear since the start of the pandemic as children picked up learning online while schools were fully or partially closed. Globally, startups in this sector have nabbed $7.82 billion from investors in the first eight months of the year, outpacing the $6.07 billion they raised in the same period of 2020, according to CB Insights. Byju's is the world's most valuable ed-tech startup at $16.5 billion, according to CB Insights.</p><p>Byju's had around 45 million students on its platform before gaining approximately 55 million more in the past year thanks to the tailwind of the pandemic, said co-founder and board member Divya Gokulnath, who is also Mr. Raveendran's wife. The bulk of Byju's users are in India.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Top News</p><p>Zoom CEO Eric Yuan at the company's offices in San Jose, Calif., in 2019.

Mr. Gensler likened the thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence to the so-called wildcat banking era that took hold in the U.S. from 1837 until 1863 in the absence of federal bank regulation. Before President Abraham Lincoln created the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, banks issued their own currencies, which they sometimes refused to redeem for their purported value in gold or silver. \"I don't think there's long-term viability for five or six thousand private forms of money,\" Mr. Gensler said in a virtual event hosted by the Washington Post. \"So in the meantime I think it's worthwhile to have an investor-protection regime placed around this.\"</p><p>Apple Is Working on iPhone Features to Help Detect Depression, Cognitive Decline</p><p>Apple Inc. is working on technology to help diagnose depression and cognitive decline, aiming for tools that could expand the scope of its burgeoning health portfolio, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
