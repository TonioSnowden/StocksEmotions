  "text": "<p>And November is set to kick off with what's widely expected to be another jumbo hike from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell (on Wednesday), as investors simulateously look (and hope) for signs of a softening up in rate-hiking plans. Big jobs data will finish off the week.</p><p>Our call of the day comes from Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. equity strategist, Mike Wilson, who two weeks ago went from one of Wall Street's biggest bears to a tactical bull. He digs into that rationale in a Sunday note to clients.</p><p>\"Bottom line, inflation has peaked and is likely to fall faster than most expect, based on M2 growth. This could provide some relief to stocks in the short term as rates fall in anticipation of the change. Combining this with the compelling technicals, we think the current rally in the S&amp;P 500 SPX has legs to 4000-4150 before reality sets in on how far 2023 EPS estimates need to come down,\" said Wilson.</p><p>M2 money supply represents less-liquid savings, money market accounts and CDs, and when that number is falling, it can mean consumers are emptying their savings. Here's his chart showing how he thinks CPI will follow M2.</p><p>Wilson believes company executives \"have/will remain mostly silent on 2023, which means estimates will stay elevated until it becomes obvious just how negative the operating leverage has become and/or companies are forced to discuss 2023 forecasts during 4Q earnings results in January/February,\" he said, adding that \"lower lows for the S&amp;P 500 are stll ahead after this rally is over.\"</p><p>\"We realize that going against one's core view in the short term can be dangerous (and maybe wrong-headed), but that's part of our job. It's like a double-breaking putt in golf â€“ hard to make, but you still gotta try,\" said Wilson.</p><p>Read: After a stellar October, the bear market may still have room to run</p><p>The markets</p><p>Stocks DJIA SPX COMP are off to a weaker start, again led by tech, while bond yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y BX:TMUBMUSD02Y creep higher and the dollar DXY keeps climbing.
