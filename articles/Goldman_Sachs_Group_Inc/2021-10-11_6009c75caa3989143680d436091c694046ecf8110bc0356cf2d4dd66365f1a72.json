  "title": "Southwest's flight disruptions are just the latest headache for airlines",
  "text": "<p>Southwest LUV canceled nearly 2,000 flights over the weekend with hundreds more delayed, leaving passengers stranded. The stock was down nearly 3% in midday trading Monday, compared with a flat U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS and S&amp;P 500 index SPX.</p><p>Despite the stock losses, Wall Street seemed to view the weekend snags as having a limited impact on the stock and the company's bottom line.</p><p>More worryingly, however, the cancellations “bring into question whether (Southwest) is operating too stretched a schedule, relative to its limited staffing levels,” Stephen Trent at Citi said in a note Monday.</p><p>Savanthi Syth at Raymond James said it would also add to Southwest's unit cost pressure, and “may exacerbate strained labor union relations.”</p><p>The airline blamed the widespread cancelations on weather “challenges” in some of its Florida airports, compounded by “unexpected” air-traffic control issues in the same areas.</p><p>The FAA said Sunday on Twitter that no air traffic staffing shortages had been reported since Friday. Flight delays and cancellations did occur “for a few hours” on Friday afternoon and evening due “to widespread severe weather, military training, &amp; limited staffing” in the Jacksonville, Fla., area, it said.</p><p>“Some airlines continue to experience scheduling challenges due to aircraft and crews being out of place,” the FAA said.</p><p>Other airlines, however, did not report problems as acute as Southwest's, even those with several Florida hubs. The pilots' union have said that the cancellations were not part of labor-related protests.</p><p>The situation was made worse because there were fewer flights available for rebooking.</p><p>Southwest in August said it would run fewer flights through the end of the year, apart from holiday windows, in a bid to match flights to demand and to its ability to operate and staff flights.</p><p>The company has made a push to hire more workers, offering referral bonuses for its employees and other incentives, with an eye on November and December holiday travel.</p><p>Related:Goldman Sachs cuts ratings on American and JetBlue, but says it's still ‘positive' on airlines</p><p>Southwest was not alone in either strategy: Airlines cut capacity to stay afloat as bookings dried up during the pandemic and continue to be below 2019 bookings despite an uptick in the summer.</p><p>And new demands related to the pandemic, including more incidents involving unruly passengers, have led to overworked employees.</p><p>Earlier this month, IATA said it expects demand to reach 61% of 2019 levels in 2022 and remain at 40% this year. The airline industry worldwide is still looking at losses of $11.6 billion in 2022.</p><p>IATA also turned more pessimistic for this year, expecting losses of $$51.8 billion versus an estimate for $47.7 billion in losses estimated in April.</p><p>“The magnitude of the COVID-19 crisis for airlines is enormous. Over the 2020-2022 period total losses could top $200 billion,” IATA said. “To survive airlines have dramatically cut costs and adapted their business to whatever opportunities were available.”</p><p>Don't miss:The biggest risk facing investors this earnings season is lurking just beneath the surface</p><p>Bright spots include airlines' air cargo business, and domestic travel is likely to near pre-crisis levels by next year, IATA said. International travel remains a “challenge.”</p><p>U.S. airlines, in particular, also have had to make do without a demand bump from business travel, historically a bridge between the end of the summer and the start of the holiday season.</p><p>With the continuing resurgence of COVID-19 cases and concerns about the delta variant, however, a resurgence in business travel is expected for the January conference season.</p><p>Shares of Southwest have gained nearly 12% so far this year, compared with advances of around 7% for the Jets ETF and of around 17% for the S&amp;P.</p>",
