Brexit, however, continued <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ea08966-35c7-4c0c-95e1-048e70b03343\">to dog Boris Johnson's attempt</a> to project the image of a confident “convening” country. </p> <p>There are big questions about whether the G7's delivery will match its rhetoric on vaccines, climate and the effort to create a global infrastructure drive to rival China's Belt and Road Initiative, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/501551f1-5624-469c-bcf3-c31544de0e1e\">writes Gideon Rachman.</a></p> <p><em>Read more of our G7 coverage on </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/G7-japan\"><em>FT.com</em></a><em> and listen to Sebastian Payne discuss whether Brexit </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04d1af74-53a2-4b36-9fba-381094bc45c4\"><em>overshadowed</em></a><em> Johnson's efforts to forward his Global Britain agenda.</em></p> <h1>Five stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Netanyahu ousted </strong>Israel's parliament has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0824e22-2e42-4d80-b0fa-574c6b12b9dd\">voted in a new government</a>, ending the 12-year grip on power of rightwing stalwart and five-time premier Benjamin Netanyahu. Naftali Bennett, an ultranationalist, will lead an&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a243b4d-4f31-4c6c-963f-721699bf4870\">eight-party ruling coalition</a>&#xa0;that stretches from the fringe left to the extreme right and is buoyed by support from an Islamist party. Netanyahu's dethronement has been slow and grinding — but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18f00186-af55-4fbf-9bda-5e71e7683965\">is it the end</a> of Israel's longest-serving leader?</p> <p><strong>2. Goldman Sachs ramps up cobalt trading</strong> The Wall Street bank has been active in cobalt markets since last year but has more recently dipped into physical purchases of the metal for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12ea44c7-d940-4b75-bd94-4fd2116c1c76\">according to people familiar with the matter</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>3. BNP Paribas under fire over lossmaking forex trades </strong>The French bank is facing allegations that its traders <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/3a471ac3-3adc-44bc-8657-4e84f2702f06\">mis-sold billions of euros</a> of lossmaking foreign exchange products to Europe's largest wine exporter, amid a widening controversy that has enveloped Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.</p> <p><strong>4. Toshiba board chair rebuffs calls to quit </strong>Osamu Nagayama, the chair of Toshiba's board, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4535a1a-f55b-4713-b6cc-f7dccce64f77\">rebuffed shareholder calls</a> for him to resign at a 75-minute press conference on Monday and sought to blame the company's crisis on a former chief executive who was forced to resign in April. A four-hour emergency board meeting on Sunday resulted in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40d18872-59cb-4f62-863e-e92eaa5cfc94\">exit</a> of four senior executives. </p> <p><strong>5.
