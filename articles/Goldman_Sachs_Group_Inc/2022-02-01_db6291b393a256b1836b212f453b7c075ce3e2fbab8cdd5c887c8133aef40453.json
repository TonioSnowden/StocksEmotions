  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> Following its $550mn purchase of sports website The Athletic, The New York Times Company has <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/029701be-0095-4601-9610-dc96a4bd5cf9\">struck a deal</a> to acquire Wordle, the popular online puzzle game that seems to have hooked everyone in the media world (including some of us at DD).</p> <h2>Vodafone becomes the latest FTSE 100 company facing activist pressure</h2> <p>Another day, another UK company under pressure from an activist investor.</p> <p>The latest situation is taking shape at <strong>Vodafone</strong>, where Europe's largest activist fund<strong> Cevian Capital</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/769c1d71-d2d8-44c8-947f-403229cfd54a\">has called for</a> an overhaul of the UK mobile group's board and portfolio of assets.</p> <p>The fund, which is also pushing for change in the UK at education group <strong>Pearson </strong>and insurer <strong>Aviva</strong>, has built an undisclosed stake in Vodafone and has been engaging with its board and management for months.</p> <p>Cevian's arrival is less than shocking, the FT's Helen Thomas<a href=\"https://ft.com/content/61c278e5-e3c0-4a76-855c-0a4ddd15a0f7\"> explains</a>. Vodafone's chronic underperformance and a lack of faith in boss <strong>Nick Read</strong> (the company's stock has fallen 20 per cent since he took the top job in 2018) are enough to send activists circling.</p> <p>The gaggle of City grandees and non-executives lacking in telecoms experience on Vodafone's board is another easy shot. But perhaps the most striking thing is just how open Vodafone's other long-only shareholders are to welcoming an activist on board.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Millington</strong>, head of UK equities at top-10 Vodafone shareholder <strong>Abrdn</strong>, said Cevian's push to restructure the Vodafone portfolio and drive consolidation was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ff46517-dcf0-4c81-9373-c417c82b56b5\">“very sensible”.</a></p> <p>And activists aren't the only ones upending UK plc. Private equity groups have been snatching up British companies at<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/315a02d1-6606-433e-b6f4-1989f2fad27d\"> a record pace</a>.</p> <p>Buyout firms are targeting UK companies for many of the same reasons as activists, targeting underperforming companies at a time when the country's equities are relatively cheap compared to other markets.</p> <p>US hedge fund <strong>Third Point</strong>, which last month <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4fc6926-e991-43ca-9ac8-3b1478c23dd5\">called for a break-up</a> of <strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong>, summed up a common argument among the activists in the UK by asserting that the oil group had “too many competing stakeholders” resulting in “an incoherent, conflicting set of strategies attempting to appease multiple interests but satisfying none”.</p> <p><strong>Nelson Peltz</strong>, the billionaire activist behind <strong>Trian Partners</strong> who has set his sights on <strong>Unilever</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5644e85-b0f7-443d-a949-1ff7d5b33374\">understands</a> the game well. </p> <p>The UK consumer giant's failed £50bn takeover of drugmaker <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong>'s consumer health division has sent shareholder discontent to an all-time high. (GSK itself has been a<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05b4f736-31dd-4c11-b908-cd23297d6db9\"> hot zone for activists</a>).</p> <p>Like Cevian, Peltz knows the best strategy is to offer stability in a period of disarray.</p> <p>As one person close to the board of <strong>Procter &amp; Gamble</strong>, the site of one of Peltz's<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/764273e7-4ec3-39b6-9bf2-df3ed268e3ca\"> biggest campaigns</a>, put it to the FT: “Nelson is actually helpful . . . the key to his success is that he thinks very much operationally, rather than just some sort of <strong>McKinsey </strong>guy who wants to split the company.”</p> <h2>Elliott and Vista's creative mega-deal</h2> <p>From seizing Argentine warships to offering scathing public rebukes of corporate strategy,<strong> Paul Singer</strong>'s investment firm <strong>Elliott Management </strong>has always been aggressive in getting what it wants.</p> <p>Now, there's a new and lucrative tool in Elliott's toolbox: the use of copious amounts of leverage. </p> <p>On Monday, Elliott's private equity arm <strong>Evergreen Coast Capital</strong> and <strong>Vista Equity Partners </strong>struck a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e03aba67-b7df-487d-a33f-937b75b59b99\">$16.5bn buyout</a> of <strong>Citrix Systems</strong> that stands as the year's first big leveraged buyout.</p> <p>A feature of the deal is how little cash Elliott and Vista plan to put into Citrix. </p> <p>Instead of spending any new money, Vista is contributing its ownership of <strong>Tibco Software</strong> for a 65 per cent stake in the new combined company, sources told DD.</p> <p>Meanwhile Elliott and its co-investors are putting about $2.3bn of equity into the deal, but about half is the rollover of its roughly 10 per cent equity stake in Citrix.</p> <p>The remainder of the deal will be made up with a massive $17.5bn financing package. About $15bn will be done via secured and unsecured debt, and there will be a $2.5bn preferred equity financing.</p> <p>Highly leveraged deals like Citrix have paid off for Elliott. </p> <p>In November, the activist investor and <strong>Veritas</strong> <strong>Capital </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24519628-9c86-4b6e-b38c-e03142afa3ee\">made a roughly ten-times return</a> on the $17bn sale of <strong>Athenahealth</strong>. They had used mostly debt to finance their $5.7bn takeover.</p> <p>Elliott and Vista have had their fingerprints on Citrix for some time. </p> <p>Elliott first invested in Citrix in 2015, pushing for a spin-off of its <strong>GoTo </strong>meetings business, which was eventually sold to <strong>LogMeIn </strong>for $1.8bn in 2016. In early 2020, Elliott and <strong>Francisco Partners</strong> took LogMeIn private for $4.3bn.</p> <p>Elliott's re-entry into Citrix came after it announced a $2.3bn acquisition of <strong>Wrike </strong>from Vista last year, a poorly received deal that spurred Citrix's shares to plunge about 25 per cent in 2021.</p> <p>The genesis of Monday's deal came from Elliott speaking to Vista about how Citrix could jettison Wrike, two people told DD. Elliott then considered a straightforward buyout of Citrix, before choosing a merger with Tibco. The combined IT infrastructure giant will probably make more acquisitions, sources say.</p> <p>One deal that's unlikely to happen is a re-merger of LogMeIn and Citrix under Elliott's ownership, said a source.</p> <h2>Private equity lawyers pocket plenty from the talent war</h2> <p>If you want to find the busiest associates in law's so-called magic circle, look no further than the private equity lawyers. </p> <p>In the case of international firm<strong> Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer</strong>, they happen to be feeling a little more flush too. </p> <p>The firm handed out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48b46c1e-7245-400a-99cd-38070fe69628\">an extra bonus</a> to its private equity lawyers last year, the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48b46c1e-7245-400a-99cd-38070fe69628#comments-anchor\">Kate Beioley</a> reports, amounting to about £50,000 for some mid-ranking lawyers, over and above their usual year-end payouts. </p> <p>The latest round of bonuses comes after last year's boom in M&amp;A and private equity activity sparked a fierce talent war for lawyers. </p> <p>Firms like American heavyweight <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong>, known for its supercharged private equity practice, offers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4c29c47-64ce-45e7-b5d7-6da3c65866d6\">highly competitive</a> sums to new recruits, which in turn pressures their international rivals to keep up. </p> <p>Its methods have proved effective. Last year Freshfields lost <strong>Vincent Bergin</strong> — a partner who had worked on deals for buyout firm <strong>CVC</strong> — and private equity partner<strong> Keir MacLennan</strong> to Kirkland.</p> <p>Mid-ranking lawyers aren't the only ones being paid more flexibly. In the face of pressure to reward star partners, elite firms have taken steps in recent years to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d13a9ba-6e91-4063-9e85-b1b8184f9f4a\"> dismantle so-called pure lockstep</a> pay structures that mean partners of the same vintage will be paid the same.</p> <p>One partner at a City law firm thinks Freshfields' decision is sound. It is “absolutely bonkers to have a one-size-fits-all approach”, they said. Let's hope lawyers in other divisions feel the same way. </p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Steve Koltes</strong>, co-founder of European private equity firm <strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/872b42a8-7685-4684-ac0c-c3c8f5f0be8e?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">is stepping down</a> this year as the company works on plans for a stock market listing.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Macro Advisory Partners</strong> has appointed <strong>Mark Carney</strong>, former governor of the<strong> Bank of Canada</strong> and the <strong>Bank of England</strong>, as senior counsellor.
