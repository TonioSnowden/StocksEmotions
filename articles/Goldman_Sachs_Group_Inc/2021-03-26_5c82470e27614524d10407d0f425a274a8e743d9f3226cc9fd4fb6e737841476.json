  "title": "Consortium raises bid for Kaz Minerals to £4bn",
  "text": "<p>The battle for control of Kaz Minerals looks to be drawing to a close with the consortium bidding to take the copper miner private making a £4bn final offer.</p> <p>Nova Resources, which is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5b98591-6cd4-46ec-a6db-a8c9d8c202e6\">controlled by Kaz chair Oleg Novachuk</a> and metals tycoon Vladimir Kim, raised its takeover offer to 850p per share, in addition to a special dividend due to shareholders of 27 US cents that was previously to be withheld. The sweetened proposal was worth 869p per share in total, up from 780p&#xa0;previously. &#xa0;</p> <p>Through Nova Resources, Novachuk and Kim made an initial 640p cash offer in October for the 61 per cent of the company they did not already own. That bid was immediately knocked down by two of Kaz's biggest minority shareholders, CFC Management and RWC Partners, who said it materially undervalued the company's assets and projects. Nova then increased its offer to 780p in February but Kaz Mineral's share price has continued to trade well above that level on the back of a surge in the price of copper, which recently hit a 10-year high.</p> <p>To take Kaz private Nova needs acceptance from 75 per cent of shareholders. Investors including Novachuk and Kim who represent nearly 60 per cent of the shares had backed the lower offer.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>Aviva</strong> has concluded a restructuring programme by agreeing the sale of its Polish division to Allianz for €2.5bn in cash, its eighth disposal of a non-core division in as many months. The sale “significantly improves” Aviva's financial strength with an increase in excess capital of £1.5bn and a boost to net asset value equivalent to 46p per share, the insurer said. </p> <p><strong>Stagecoach </strong>said it sees a positive outlook for regional bus services thanks in part to government support, including a new National Bus Strategy for England. A trading update revealed unchanged conditions since December. With state support in place, Stagecoach's local bus operations continue to generate an operating profit while its London network has been operating normally and will deliver an operating profit slightly ahead of the prior year, the company said.</p> <p>Engineer <strong>Smiths Group</strong> said it is on track to meet full-year expectations after delivering a £67m pre-tax profit for the half year ended January, down 4 per cent year on year. The company said trends were improving in the second half, supported by restructuring, with an interim dividend raised by 6 per cent to 11.7p per share reflecting confidence in medium and longer term prospects. Separately, Smiths announced a contract win with Heathrow airport to upgrade X-ray security scanners. </p> <p>Software maker <strong>Idox</strong> said trading in the first quarter has been robust and in line with the board's expectations. The company said it was setting up an in-house merger and acquisition team to investigate opportunities after completing the sale of its content division earlier this year. </p> <p><strong>Oxford Instruments</strong>, the scientific tools and systems maker, said revenue for its full-year ending March will be marginally ahead of last year. It said end markets were resilient and order growth has remained good, particularly in China, with the strongest growth across semiconductor applications.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p>Mark Zuckerberg denied his social media platform paved the way for the storming of the US Capitol on January 6 by allowing misinformation, hate speech and online extremism to flourish. The <strong>Facebook</strong> chief executive was appearing in front of a House panel on Thursday via video link. Alongside him was <strong>Twitter</strong> chief executive Jack Dorsey and <strong>Google's</strong> head Sundar Pichai. The Silicon Valley executives faced a barrage of criticism over their content moderation failures during <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39a699fc-1730-4a5d-b43e-634ebe189d79\">a bruising hearing</a>.</p> <p><strong>Amazon</strong> has told <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60b9f312-3b81-4b8d-952c-4a59d6d2b254\">the Texas Supreme Court</a> it is “not realistic” to expect the company to vet the products sold on its platform, arguing it was not to be held responsible when items bought on Amazon.com cause harm to consumers. The court will determine whether Amazon should be considered liable after a 19-month-old child was left severely injured when she ingested a lithium battery from a remote control sold by a Chinese seller on the platform, which the plaintiffs argued failed to meet industry safety standards.</p> <p>US private equity firm <strong>General Atlantic</strong> is in talks with Goldman Sachs to refinance a controversial €300m loan from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/1b922032-dfbe-4026-acf0-cc26be850f32\">Greensill Capital</a>, which filed for UK insolvency this month and whose German banking arm is now at the centre of a criminal investigation.&#xa0;The collapse of Greensill Capital has shone a harsh light on an unusual loan General Atlantic, known as one of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdb7f2fe-7589-457e-8c5d-e5f515c557da\">the most savvy investors</a> in Silicon Valley, drew from the lending specialist.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>In the near term, Cineworld is relying on cinemas reopening but in the long term management faces questions about whether it can <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/740f6c69-deb6-4258-abd1-29aad5296a3a\">bring down debt</a>.</p> <p><strong>Merryn Somerset Webb</strong> <br>Remember child trust funds (CTFs), Gordon Brown's attempt to make sure that all young people had something to their name when they turned 18?
