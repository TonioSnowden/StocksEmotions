  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>The yen's plunge to a 20-year low against the dollar will hand a significant advantage to foreign bidders in the competition for Japanese assets and drive a wave of inbound dealmaking, the chief executive of Nomura <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5e72c7c-f2ca-4020-866c-25970b42a506\">told our colleagues in Tokyo</a>.</p> <p>Speaking of which, check out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/0c0cec42-5264-4812-b5cc-0bc386030fce\">this video</a> by the FT's Leo Lewis about how Toshiba ended up becoming Japan's top takeover target.</p> <p><strong>In today's newsletter: </strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>A boardroom battle with Birkin bags</strong></p></li>  <li><p><strong>A crypto meltdown&#xa0;</strong></p></li>  <li><p><strong>China's frosty capital markets</strong></p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Lichtenstein vs Drake</strong></p> <p>The protagonists in major transactions often like to make deal toys or “tombstones” carved out of Lucite to commemorate the successful closing of a transaction. </p> <p><strong>Warren Lichtenstein</strong> in 2020 offered <strong>Eileen Drake</strong> something more practical, if luxurious. </p> <p>If the chief executive of <strong>Aerojet Rocketdyne</strong> could meet Lichtenstein's expectations in selling the defence contractor, a Birkin bag awaited. The fashion accessory can fetch more than $100,000.</p> <p>Those were happier days for the pair. Lichtenstein, a longtime big shareholder and director at Aerojet, had brought Drake to the California company in 2015. </p> <p>Today, the two are locked in one of the ugliest boardroom brawls in recent memory.</p> <p>Drake described the Birkin bag bargain in her testimony in a Delaware courtroom and Lichtenstein, in his court appearance, confirmed the offer though disputed what his criteria were to award it. </p> <p>Aerojet would go on in 2020 to announce a $4.4bn sale to <strong>Lockheed Martin</strong>. However, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ceb4116a-ce1f-4501-8b5c-413810ebb1e7\">deal died earlier this year</a> after <strong>Lina Khan</strong>'s <strong>US Federal Trade Commission</strong> sued to block it.</p> <p>Since then, Drake and Lichtenstein have waged a fight to take control of the Aerojet board, each running rival slates against each other set to culminate in a June 30 shareholder meeting. </p> <p>They're also each suing each other over mutual accusations of wrongdoing amid the battle. At the heart of the fight for control of the future board is who controls the board today, an oddly knotty question, as DD's Sujeet Indap <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35221c0e-4c29-47a4-9b46-bc8504cc7674\">reports.</a></p> <p>There are eight Aerojet directors and, believe it or not, Drake and Lichtenstein have four loyalists each (pro tip: always have an odd number of directors to avoid stalemates like this).&#xa0;</p> <p>As such, neither side can claim the mantle as the company slate.</p> <p>There is the possibility that the sides settle prior to the vote. Regardless of how the stand-off plays out, don't expect any gifts to be exchanged between Drake and Lichtenstein. &#xa0;</p> <h1>Celsius triggers crypto meltdown</h1> <p>DD doesn't typically dedicate too much space to crypto coverage. After all, there are plenty of other<a href=\"https://digitalassets.ft.com/\"> great parts</a> of the FT that have you covered.</p> <p>But in the past year many regular subjects of this newsletter — such as <strong>SoftBank</strong> and <strong>Tiger Global</strong> — have started pouring big money into the space. And now the sheer carnage in crypto is becoming harder to ignore.</p> <p>Yesterday crypto lender<strong> Celsius</strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25ac1667-9f50-4f16-b553-448ea4582613\"> blocked customers</a> from pulling funds from its platform under the pretence that it was trying to protect its “community”. That's code for the company is unable to meet its obligations. </p> <p>News that Celsius was blocking withdrawals came just after its chief executive, <strong>Alex Mashinsky</strong>, challenged critics at the weekend to find “even one person who has a problem withdrawing”. That didn't age well. </p> <p>As the FT's Bryce Elder explains in this excellent<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d503e3c-d624-4331-8c7f-4c7c42239472\"> Alphaville post</a>, Celsius was forced to gate redemptions either because it is functionally insolvent — ie it lacks liquidity — or it is balance sheet insolvent. Bryce says it isn't inconceivable that it could be the latter. </p> <p>Quick to follow was <strong>Binance</strong>, the world's largest crypto exchange, which hours later halted withdrawals of bitcoin as prices tanked by 20 per cent. </p> <p>Binance's founder <strong>Changpeng Zhao</strong> initially said it was a “temporary pause” that would last about 30 minutes, before conceding that it would take “a bit longer” to fix.</p> <p>This is just the latest in a series of unfortunate events for the crypto market, which has been embraced by institutional as well as retail investors. </p> <p>Celsius' troubles are bound to turn up the heat at CDPQ (short for <strong>Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec</strong>), the second-largest pension fund in Canada, which just eight months ago touted its “thorough” due diligence on the company. </p> <p>“We are very careful . . . our DD process is very serious,” Alexandre Synnett, chief technology officer for CDPQ told the FT.&#xa0;</p> <p>While any criticism of the crypto industry is usually met with fierce resistance and accusations of<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mashinsky/status/1535767334668861440\"> spreading FUD</a> — fear, uncertainty and doubt — DD is increasingly coming to the conclusion that perhaps crypto is just a FAD.</p> <p>On the other hand: when has supermodel <strong>Gisele Bündchen </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50d1aecb-f5b7-4695-bb7b-3b795ebbd6ed\">ever been wrong</a> about financial matters?</p> <h1>Xi's IPO market</h1> <p>Almost a year since Beijing began a ruthless crackdown on China's technology sector, the question has become: should Wall Street call time on its long and lucrative trade in Chinese stocks?</p> <p>The numbers certainly don't look good. About 95 per cent of the $35bn raised by Chinese listings this year was done locally in Shanghai and Shenzhen. </p> <p>That's bad news for investment banks like <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>, which over the past decade have brought in billions of dollars in revenues on the back of New York and Hong Kong listings by loads of Chinese tech groups.</p> <p>As one senior syndicate banker at a Wall Street investment bank lamented: “The US is proving very, very difficult.” And hopes that New York's China deals pipeline could be redirected to Hong Kong have so far been in vain, since Beijing still hasn't released the final rules of its new regime for offshore initial public offerings.</p> <p>But the loss of access to foreign listings channels by Chinese corporates is only one part of the story as <strong>Xi Jinping</strong> pushes forward with plans to reshape his country's equity capital markets.</p> <p>Government-led funds with a war chest of more than $900bn are splashing cash at strategic sectors where the Communist party wants to foster a new generation of national champions. </p> <p>And instead of disruptive tech platforms chasing the game-changing success of <strong>Alibaba</strong> and <strong>Tencent</strong>, China's IPO pipeline is pumping out chipmakers, electric vehicle outfits and biotech start-ups that officials view as vital to China's future tech supremacy and national security.</p> <p>Even <strong>Bain &amp; Company</strong> is wary of investing in Chinese companies that lack clear state backing, flagging a need to “think about the sectors that can actually benefit from a policy perspective”.</p> <p>If that sounds like a far cry from the days of <strong>Sequoia</strong> and <strong>SoftBank</strong> funding dynamic start-ups with plans to reshape the Chinese economy, that's because it is. </p> <p>As the FT's Hudson Lockett reports in this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5b81ea0-5955-414c-b2eb-886dfed4dffe\">Big Read</a>, things are only going to get weirder as Xi attempts to wed market forces to Communist party policy.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Former federal prosecutor <strong>Preet Bharara </strong>is joining law firm <strong>WilmerHale</strong>.
