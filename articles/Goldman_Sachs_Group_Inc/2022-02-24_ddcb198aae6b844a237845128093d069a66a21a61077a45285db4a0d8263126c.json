By 2019, he was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/035be220-199a-11e9-b93e-f4351a53f1c3\">fully under siege</a> from<strong> Edward Bramson</strong>, one of Britain's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c127e24-d2e3-11e8-a9f2-7574db66bcd5\">most feared activists</a>, who was vying for Staley to scale back investment banking in favour of credit cards and retail operations. </p> <p>So when the pandemic sent banks' earnings and loan-loss reserves snowballing and a historic dealmaking boom sent investment banking revenues to record heights, DD wondered if Staley had some sort of crystal ball. His aggressive investment strategy shift is still paying off, as Barclays' profit <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7f22c43-3c2b-441c-8774-b2225dafd8f0\">more than quadrupled</a> in the fourth quarter. </p> <p>Only, Staley never had psychic tendencies, as DD readers are well aware, because he would have known that his past was about to come back to bite.</p> <p>In November, Staley suddenly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b96a25c2-a5e1-4d06-8278-ed1f703f2dfd\">found himself out of the job</a> after an investigation by UK regulators into his 15-year relationship with disgraced financier and sex offender <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>. Staley's connections to Epstein date back to the early 2000s, when he ran JPMorgans private bank, of which the late paedophile was a key client.</p> <p>On Wednesday it wasn't Staley who stood before investors to deliver the bank's latest earnings, but his top lieutenant and fellow JPMorgan alum <strong>CS Venkatakrishnan</strong>, known as Venkat. </p> <p>Even before Staley's fall from grace, Venkat was considered a top candidate for CEO alongside Barclay's then-global head of banking <strong>Paul Compton</strong>. The two were installed opposite each other in senior roles at the investment bank to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5074afb7-9c1f-4bbb-b0cb-c765d4cfe736\">“prove their mettle”</a> in September 2020. </p> <p>When Venkat was appointed chief, Compton stepped in as sole head of the investment bank. But just because he came in second doesn't mean he's missing out.</p> <p>Formerly the bank's head of global markets, Venkat took a pay cut when he accepted his new £2.7mn annual salary, Barclay's fourth-quarter results revealed. Though that figure could grow as high as £9.45mn for this year after factoring in various bonuses and benefits.</p> <p>Even more interestingly, a gander through Barclays' pillar 3 disclosures (see below) reveals that only one employee earned more than €11mn in 2020 (about $12.4mn), and a source close to the bank tells the FT's Stephen Morris that person is none other than Compton, Venkat's second-in-command.*</p> <p>That pay could likely grow even higher in 2022, the person added, since Compton had been co-heading the investment bank with Venkat prior to Staley's abrupt departure.</p> <p>A spokesperson from Barclays declined to comment on whether Compton was its top-earner in 2021.</p> <p>Wednesday's earnings also revealed that longtime finance director <strong>Tushar Morzaria </strong>has retired, and will be replaced by his deputy <strong>Anna Cross</strong>. </p> <p>Despite all the reshuffling in the wake of Staley's exit, the former chief's modus operandi is still very much present. His successor has vowed to maintain Staley's core strategy of moulding Barclays' investment bank into a Wall Street contender.</p> <p>Something else of Staley's has been left behind too: millions of pounds in unvested share awards, which the UK lender will keep frozen until the regulatory probe into his past relationship with Epstein concludes. </p> <h2>Buying into the beautiful game&#xa0;</h2> <p>Private equity just can't get enough of football. </p> <p><strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong>, <strong>Hellman &amp; Friedman</strong>, <strong>Silver Lake</strong> and <strong>Oaktree Capital</strong> are circling France's top league, where clubs have struggled to compete against the financial might of their rivals in England, Germany and Spain.</p> <p><strong>Ligue de Football Professionnel </strong><a href=\"https://ft.com/content/57ba9898-a346-4554-9a90-97845900a3e0\">is inviting formal bids</a> for a stake in a new company that will market its broadcast rights in a deal that could be worth €1.5bn.</p> <p>Luxembourg-based CVC has been here before, agreeing a similar structure to invest in Spain's La Liga, despite being forced to exclude<strong> FC Barcelona </strong>and<strong> Real Madrid</strong>, the two biggest clubs in the competition.</p> <p>In a different way, it's also familiar ground for Silver Lake and Oaktree. Silver Lake has a stake in Ligue 1 team <strong>Espérance Sportive Troyes Aube Champagne </strong>and Oaktree owns French Ligue 2 club <strong>Caen</strong>. (Both have also struck football deals outside France: Silver Lake has a stake in <strong>City Football Group</strong>, which owns<strong> Manchester City</strong>, and Oaktree has financed Italy's <strong>Inter Milan</strong>.)</p> <p>That raises the prospect of bidders claiming that their rivals are tarnished by potential conflicts. &#xa0;</p> <p>That Ligue 1 is inching closer to private equity firms shows the sport's changing attitude towards partnering with big outside investors, although clubs in the German <strong>Bundesliga </strong>and Italy's <strong>Serie A </strong>rejected offers last year. </p> <p>League-wide deals are perceived to be less risky than buying or lending to an individual club. But many investors are separately lining up to buy teams or provide debt in a sector that is unloved by banks, which have to weigh up the risk of inciting a fan protest if loans go sour.</p> <p>Funds overseen by <strong>Ares Management Corporation</strong> took a minority stake in <strong>Atlético Madrid </strong>last June. US investment firm<strong> ALK Capital</strong> owns <strong>Burnley</strong>, the <strong>Premier League </strong>club, while <strong>Orkila Capital </strong><a href=\"https://www.clubbrugge.be/en/news/club-brugge-strengthens-owner-structure-view-future-growth\">acquired</a> almost a quarter of Belgian champions <strong>Club Brugge </strong>last July and Miami-based <strong>777 Partners </strong>owns a stake in Spain's <strong>Sevilla</strong> and bought Italy's <strong>Genoa</strong> last year.</p> <p><strong>MSD Partners</strong>, the private equity firm linked to computing billionaire <strong>Michael Dell</strong>, has lent to Burnley and Premier League rivals<strong> Southampton </strong>and <strong>West Ham</strong>.</p> <p>Want to learn more about the flood of funds into the beautiful game and hear from some of its most influential figures?
