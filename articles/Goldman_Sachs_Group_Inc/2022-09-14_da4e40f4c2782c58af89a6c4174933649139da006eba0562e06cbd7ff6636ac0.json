  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Corteva to Lay Off 5% of Staff  ----  By Patrick Thomas",
  "text": "<p>    Corteva Inc. is preparing to lay off roughly a thousand of its workers across the globe as part of the seed and pesticide maker's broader restructuring plan. </p><p>    Corteva, which was part of DowDuPont before it was spun out of the industrial conglomerate in 2019, said at an investor presentation on Tuesday that it is laying off about 5% of its 21,000-person global workforce. The company is a top supplier to Iowa soybean producers, Brazilian corn operations and other farmers around the world. </p><p>   The agricultural giant is the latest company to announce plans to shrink its workforce as costs for labor, raw materials and transportation pressure businesses. Ford Motor Co. said last month it would shed 3,000 jobs, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recently said it was preparing to lay off hundreds of employees. Corteva officials said Tuesday that the company plans to exit from about 35 countries and focus on 110 countries,  such as in North America, Europe and Brazil. </p><p></p>",
