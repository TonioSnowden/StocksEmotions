  "text": "<p>On another note, this weekend will mark the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks here in the U.S. Many of us will reflect back on the day and perhaps mourn the losses of loved ones, friends, neighbors or colleagues. The private-equity community lost a number of its own that day, including Christopher Mello and David Retik, who at the time worked for what was Alta Communications, and Brian Dale, a founding partner at what was Blue Capital Management. Loved ones and colleagues of Mr. Mello and Mr. Retik haved helped carry on their legacies through the David E. Retik Christopher Mello Foundation, a nonprofit organization that to date has donated more than $2 million in grants to support a host of different charities. Meanwhile, David Retik's widow Susan Retik formed another nonprofit in partnership with Patti Quigley, whose spouse also died in the attacks, called Beyond the 11th, which supports Afghan widows.</p><p>As we head into the weekend, I leave you with words from a TedTalk Susan gave (if you haven't seen it, you can check it out here). \"Humanity is not something that just happens.
