  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Friday's Markets: Dow Jumps 800 Points On Easing Rate Fears",
  "text": "<p>Indexes have bounced back after the S&amp;P 500 last week tumbled into a bear market, defined as a 20% drop from a recent high. The broad market index finished the week up 6.4%, though it is still down about 18% from its last record close in January.</p><p>The Dow industrials gained 5.4% for the week, while the Nasdaq rallied 7.5%. All three indexes recouped their losses from the previous week.</p><p>Stocks tumbled earlier this month on concerns that the Fed could push the economy into a recession as it tightens monetary policy to combat inflation. Market indexes rebounded this week after bargain-hunters swooped in to buy cheap stocks and -- in a paradoxical twist where bad news was good news -- some worse-than-expected economic figures fueled investors' hopes that the Fed might become less hawkish.</p><p>\"It's clear that economic activity is cooling, which should cool down inflation. That together is rather positive,\" said Luc Filip, head of investments at SYZ Private Banking.</p><p>The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment dropped in June to its lowest-ever recorded level, according to survey data released on Friday. The drop highlighted the grim mood among Americans as inflation eats into their purchasing power and recession fears loom.</p><p>The university also revised its May reading of inflation expectations over the next five to 10 years, lowering them to 3.1% from 3.3%. The revision fueled some optimism that the Fed wouldn't be as aggressive about raising interest rates, analysts said, and added to market gains after the survey's release at 10 a.m. ET. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had cited the survey's May reading for long-term inflation expectations in explaining last week's 0.75 percentage point rate increase.</p><p>Earlier, the U.S. composite purchasing managers index, which measures activity in manufacturing and services, fell to a five-month low on Thursday.</p><p>Data from interest-rate derivatives markets suggests that traders think the Fed could be cutting rates by the second half of next year. \"Growth is coming down, maybe even sooner than expected. That should allow the Fed to soften at some point,\" said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank.</p><p>Matt Stucky, senior portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, warned that this past week's rebound doesn't mean the market has hit bottom. The Fed will need more evidence that it is winning the fight against inflation before it steps back from raising interest rates, he said.</p><p>All 11 sectors of the S&amp;P 500 ended Friday in positive territory, with materials, financials, technology and consumer-discretionary stocks among the strongest performers. Bank stocks got a boost from the Fed's annual stress tests, released late Thursday, which gave the country's biggest lenders a clean bill of health. Shares of Wells Fargo rose $2.86, or 7.5%, to $40.76 on Friday, while Goldman Sachs added $16.58 per share, or 5.8%, to $302.75.</p><p>The close of trading saw heavy volumes Friday as index provider FTSE Russell rebalanced its stock benchmarks, an annual event in which it adds and removes companies from indexes tied to trillions of dollars of investments. The managers of passive funds tied to those indexes generally buy or sell those stocks around 4 p.m. ET on the day of the so-called Russell rebalance, to ensure their funds track their benchmarks accurately.</p><p>Nasdaq said a record 3.3 billion shares, worth $63.8 billion, changed hands in the closing auction that sets official end-of-day prices for Nasdaq-listed stocks. The New York Stock Exchange said it had the fourth-largest close in NYSE history, as its closing-auction volume hit 2.3 billion shares worth $79.3 billion.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
