  "text": "<p>Pearson shares climbed 23%, to just under 800 pence.</p><p>Pearson said both offers “significantly undervalued the company and its future prospects” as the London based publisher's board unanimously rejected the offers.</p><p>Apollo earlier had said in a statement to the London Stock Exchange that it was “in the preliminary stages of evaluating a possible cash offer.”</p><p>Even with Friday's surge, the stock is still 6% lower than its August highs. It's been hurt by a drop in U.S. higher educational courseware as enrollments declined.</p><p>Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs are Pearson's advisers. Barclays is advising Apollo.</p>",
