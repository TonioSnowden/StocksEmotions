  "title": "PayPal to Buy Japan's Paidy for $2.7 Billion; Set to close in the fourth quarter, it's the latest in a flurry of deals involving 'buy now, pay later' companies",
  "text": "<p>U.S.-listed PayPal says it has more than 400 million consumers and merchants in more than 200 markets. Its business has grown rapidly with the shift from cash and in-store card spending to digital payments and e-commerce. PayPal has used the pandemic's shift toward contactless payments to push into big chain stores via QR codes.</p><p>In the second quarter, PayPal handled more than $300 billion of payments for the first time in its history.</p><p>PayPal will pay for Paidy primarily in cash, it said late Tuesday. It expects the deal to close in the fourth quarter and to minimally dilute earnings per share, as measured on a non-GAAP basis, or not in line with generally accepted accounting principles.</p><p>Paidy lets Japanese shoppers make purchases online and then make monthly payments in a consolidated bill at a convenience store or via bank transfer.</p><p>The company uses proprietary technology to score creditworthiness, underwrite transactions and guarantee payment to merchants, and says its 3-Pay monthly installment offering has more than 6 million registered users.</p><p>Paidy will continue to operate its existing business, retain its own brand, and continue to be led by Russell Cummer, founder and executive chairman, and Riku Sugie, president and chief executive.</p><p>Paidy's backers include George Soros's sons Jonathan and Robert. In April, Paidy said it had raised a total of $120 million of so-called Series D funding from the two men's family offices, JS Capital Management LLC and Soros Capital Management LLC, as well from the investment managers Tybourne Capital Management Ltd. and Wellington Management.</p><p>BofA Securities Inc. acted as financial adviser to PayPal, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. advised Paidy.</p><p>Write to P.R.
