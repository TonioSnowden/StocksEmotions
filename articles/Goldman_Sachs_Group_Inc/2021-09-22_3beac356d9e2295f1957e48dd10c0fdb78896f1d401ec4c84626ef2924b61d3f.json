  "text": "<p>The Democratic-controlled US House of Representatives passed a bill to avert a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5fb0614d-ea49-48c6-a6fb-0f7a23dfa2ae\">government shutdown</a> on October 1 and extend the US debt limit until December next year, setting up a high-stakes stand-off with Republicans that risks spiralling into a full-blown fiscal crisis. </p> <p>The party-line vote on Tuesday night, with 220 Democrats voting in favour of the bill and 211 Republicans opposing it, highlights the deep polarisation in Congress over the most basic <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fbba9770-ce1c-46d6-9ec0-c51063b6f96e\">budgetary policies</a>. </p> <p>The proposed legislation passed by the House is highly unlikely to be approved by the Senate, where at least 10 Republicans would need to support it in order to advance. </p> <p>If the stand-off over government funding remains unresolved by the end of the month it would lead to the closure of many federal operations on October 1 — and if no compromise is reached on the borrowing limit, the US may be forced into a damaging default on its sovereign debt. Earlier this month Janet Yellen, Treasury secretary, warned Washington risked running out of cash during the month of October unless Congress took action to increase the debt ceiling. </p> <p>“A default would be a catastrophic blow to the nascent economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, wrote in a note on Tuesday. “Global financial markets would be upended and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations.” </p> <p>In a letter sent to Yellen on Tuesday, top members of the US government advisory group known as the Treasury Bond Advisory Committee warned of “severe consequences” should the department be left with insufficient funds to cover its debt payments.&#xa0;</p> <p>“If a protracted fight over the debt limit casts doubt on the creditworthiness of the US government or the timeliness of its debt payments, the Treasury market would likely experience significant disruptions that could spark broader market stress,” Beth Hammack, global treasurer of Goldman Sachs and chair of TBAC, wrote in the letter with co-chair Brian Sack,&#xa0;director of global economics for the DE Shaw group.</p> <p>“We are concerned that prolonged debt ceiling uncertainty could cause long-lasting reputational and economic impacts on Treasury securities,” they added. “Legislative debate that brings the federal government perilously close to defaulting erodes investor confidence, raises the prospect of a downgrade in the US's credit rating, and could have damaging effects on demand for Treasuries right as our nation's debt rises to new peaks.”</p> <p>“To default would be unthinkable, but even to risk that outcome would be reckless and irresponsible,” Hammack and Sack warned.</p> <p>Congressional Republicans have opposed increasing the debt limit on the grounds that it would imply their consent to president Joe Biden's multitrillion-dollar spending agenda, which they are trying to block. However, a rise in the debt ceiling would allow the Treasury to borrow to cover past spending, including measures wholeheartedly approved by Republicans during the Donald Trump's administration. </p> <p>The political friction over government funding and the debt ceiling between Democrats and Republicans comes as lawmakers within Biden's party are struggling to coalesce around a plan to pass his $3.5tn expansion of the social safety net, coupled with climate change measures and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/452fb8b3-fd2a-4403-8f2e-43f8895a9131\">tax increases</a>. Moderate Democrats are demanding a smaller package, including more modest tax rises on the wealthy and businesses, but progressive Democrats are baulking. </p> <p>The House legislation passed on Tuesday would also provide more than $34bn in additional funding for Afghan refugee aid and disaster relief following a spate of damaging floods and wildfires across the US in recent weeks. </p><p>Source: James Politi in Washington and Colby Smith in New York 2021 'House Democrats approve lifting US debt ceiling and averting government shutdown' FT.com 22 September.
