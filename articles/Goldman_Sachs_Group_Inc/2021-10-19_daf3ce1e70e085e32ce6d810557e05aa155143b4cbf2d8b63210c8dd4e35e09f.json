  "text": "<p>Just weeks after lambasting British business leaders for relying on cheap overseas labour, Boris Johnson struck a very different tone with their global counterparts as the prime minister rolled out the “green carpet” at a net zero-focused London investment summit. </p> <p>The government brought together some of the world's top investors on Tuesday — from BlackRock chair Larry Fink and Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates — alongside cabinet ministers at London's Science Museum, which had been recast for the day as a showcase for British innovation. </p> <p>This was the prelude to meetings between government officials and executives to win future overseas spending on the UK's green infrastructure and technology — and to help reverse a slide in foreign investment since the Brexit referendum.</p> <p>Ministers stalked up and down the front row of the event. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, investment minister Gerry Grimstone and transport secretary Grant Shapps led the charm offensive ahead of a speech by Johnson.</p> <p>The event attracted investors representing $24tn, according to the prime minister, who said he welcomed “each and every” dollar to the UK, and talked up the need for a combination of “innovation, capitalism and a strong government lead”.</p> <p>“Now is the moment for you to buy into a country that has longstanding and natural advantages as a home for investment,” he said.</p> <p>Johnson highlighted the “new freedoms” outside the EU that would allow the UK to better regulate a wide range of areas, from financial services to tech, promising investors that the British government will “be with you every step of the way”.</p> <p>Many in the room had already felt the warm embrace of the UK establishment at a dinner the previous evening with the lord mayor of London. A more select VIP list was invited to eat with the prime minister, including Gates, who announced a £400m investment in green tech. </p> <p>Ministers played up comparisons with a similar event held by French president Emmanuel Macron in June, which claimed to have generated more than €3bn in investment.</p> <p>While Macron used the ornate setting of the palace of Versailles to woo more than 100 chief executives from companies such as Microsoft and Alibaba, the UK government asked the royal family to host a reception at Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening. </p> <p>Financiers were given pointers about how to address the Queen: “ma'am to rhyme with jam”, according to Grimstone, who described a “friendly competition” with the French for investments. </p> <p>Despite jokes about the electric coaches taking the visiting bosses to Windsor, there was a serious intention to beat the scale and the sums pledged at the Paris event, with more than £10bn of investments announced on Tuesday.</p> <p>But the £6bn promised in offshore wind power projects by Iberdrola had been reported before. Other deals, such as the £1.5bn pledged by developer Prologis in net zero warehouses, were already committed, if not announced, before the summit. Emily Thornberry, shadow trade secretary, said many pledges were “re-announced and most of them years from delivery”.</p> <p>Grimstone said the success of the summit would be in future investment rather than “snapshots good for promotional purposes” around the event.</p> <p>He described the attendees as “targets”: they should expect further calls to get them to commit funds to the UK.</p> <p>His task is to reverse the downward trend in foreign investment to the UK. A survey by EY shows a decline in the number of foreign direct investment projects in the UK since a peak in 2017. That reversed a trend that involved the number of projects nearly doubling in the previous six years.</p> <p>Grimstone said: “It would be amazing if it hadn't gone down in 2019. This country lived with the uncertainty of Brexit. People outside the country got bored with it.”</p> <p>Investors at the Science Museum were also optimistic that the summit could mark a turning point. </p> <p>Amanda Blanc, chief executive of insurer Aviva, said the meeting was “crucial”, adding: “Attracting more investment into the UK is a national priority . . . the UK is starting from a strong base and [this] is all about making the UK an even more attractive investment destination.”</p> <p>Inge Berge, cofounder of Norway's Wastefront, which is developing a £100m tyre recycling plant in Sunderland, said that “these kinds of events need to happen in order to get people to put it on the agenda in order to get the changes”. </p> <p>But Nigel Driffield, professor of international business at Warwick Business School, said it would be tough to reverse the downward trend in foreign investment.</p> <p>“They might generate a few headlines from it but there is no real sign of a bounceback yet,” he added. “The UK's main value proposition was as a bridge into Europe and now we are going to be more limited in attracting firms that just want to do business here.”</p> <p>Johnson's words contrasted with his comments at the Conservative party conference this month, when he accused British business of wrongly relying on cheap foreign workers.</p> <p>Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturing body Make UK, said on Monday there was “a feeling within industry that the government is still fighting the last war and sees business as the enemy within”.</p> <p>Grimstone acknowledged that this was an event not directed at UK business. “It wasn't for them,” he said. “The whole purpose of this was to bring these large global investors to Britain to invest in Britain.”</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Leila Abboud, Jim Pickard and Valentina Romei</em></p><p>Source: Daniel Thomas in London 2021 'Britain courts global players to boost post-Brexit investment' FT.com 19 October.
