  "text": "<h2>Dealmakers brace for a new era in US antitrust&#xa0;</h2> <p>Late last year a Democratic-led group of US lawmakers issued a damning 449-page Congressional report comparing Big Tech to the monopolies seen in the era of “oil barons and railroad tycoons”.</p> <p>Needless to say, its targets didn't respond well. <strong>Amazon </strong>responded with a <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/fringe-notions-on-antitrust-would-destroy-small-businesses-and-hurt-consumers?asc_campaign=commerce-pra&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.businessinsider.com%2Ftech-reactions-antitrust-report-2020-10&amp;asc_source=browser&amp;tag=biauto-41330-20\">scathing blog post</a> that hit back at “the presumption that success can only be the result of anti-competitive behaviour”.</p> <p>The public spat was perhaps foreshadowing what was to come: a new sheriff in town, confirmed by congressional Democrats, who happens to be one of Big Tech's most vocal critics.</p> <p>DD readers need no introduction to <strong>Lina Khan, </strong>the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57cd6686-d1ee-4321-ae35-a8e1fc7f0813\">new chair</a> of the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong>, who is keen on returning the US regulator to its trustbusting origins.</p> <p>As part of this overhaul, Khan wants to look at US merger guidelines — a set of rules that help regulators determine what to look for when deciding if a merger is illegal, as the FT's Kiran Stacey reports in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eba8d3d7-dba7-4389-858c-5406c31b413d\">this Big Read</a>.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Khan and her fellow Democratic commissioners have already voted to rescind two FTC policies. The first imposed limits on how the agency could use its regulatory powers to prosecute antitrust cases and the second limited the circumstances under which companies had to seek approval before mergers.&#xa0;</p> <p>“These changes are going to make dealmakers think about things differently,” a senior Democrat working for the commission told the FT.</p> <p>A big shift was announced last week: if the regulator is unable to review a merger ahead of time, it reserves the right to take action after the fact.&#xa0;</p> <p>That decision stems from the “tidal wave” of merger cases filed thus far (2,573 notifications in the first nine months of this fiscal year, already 50 per cent more than were received in all of 2020) at a time when its staff numbers and budget have seen better days.</p> <p>An avalanche of cases isn't the only obstacle threatening the FTC's plans. Large companies and law firms have embarked on a poaching spree, tempting commission staff with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/046d42d1-ec0b-4649-af6a-592430b5668c\">eye-popping sums</a> as they gear up to take on a more aggressive FTC.</p> <p>“Private firms are paying quite a bit more than they were six months ago,” said<strong> Ian Conner, </strong>who left as head of the FTC's bureau of competition in March to join<strong> Latham &amp; Watkins</strong>. “A first-year associate can now earn over $200,000 in the private sector. At the FTC they would be on $60,000 to $70,000.”</p> <p>The FTC's first big test will arrive in the next few weeks when it decides whether to refile its case against <strong>Facebook</strong>.</p> <p>The stakes are high. The case, which a judge <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bedb65dd-53c9-4e31-b3d7-c85a40fdb104\">dismissed</a> in June, could ultimately result in either the break-up of the social media company — or a demoralising defeat for Khan's new regime.&#xa0;</p> <h2>DraftKings makes a big bet on online casinos</h2> <p>The Houston billionaire <strong>Tilman Fertitta</strong> has fully embraced the boom in blank-cheque companies.&#xa0;</p> <p>The owner of the <strong>Houston Rockets</strong> basketball team has set up a series of special-purpose acquisition companies with the investment bank <strong>Jefferies</strong> as co-sponsor. One of those Spacs, <strong>Landcadia II</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5da01704-9191-4f0f-b2d6-eaf8f5b6b308\">merged</a> last year with <strong>Golden Nugget Online Gaming</strong>, a business owned by Fertitta himself.&#xa0;</p> <p>The deal valued GNOG at $745m, though about a quarter of the $690m in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1768012/000110465920077710/tm2023623d3_ex99-2.htm\">proceeds from the transaction</a> was used to pay down the company's debt.</p> <p>Now, less than a year after GNOG became a public company, <strong>DraftKings</strong> has swooped in to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f857e397-adab-4b95-b308-caa59b8d2b49\">buy the business for $1.56bn</a> — doubling its valuation. As part of the all-stock transaction, GNOG shareholders will receive 0.365 DraftKings shares for each common share they own.</p> <p>The US fantasy sports outfit, as most of our readers by now know, is one of the most successful groups ever to go public through a blank-cheque company (its shares are up more than 400 per cent from the $10 price at which Spacs list).</p> <p>For that price, DraftKings will get access to GNOG's more than 5m customers and some added commercial benefits from partnering up with <strong>Fertitta Entertainment</strong>, the business empire owned by Fertitta, which is also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/753d33d1-5a59-41dd-907d-25d76e373fe7\">going public</a> through a Spac at a <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fertitta-entertainment-inc-announces-amendment-to-merger-agreement-with-fast-acquisition-corp-301323791.html\">revised</a> $8.6bn valuation.</p> <p>The real prize is GNOG's so-called iGaming accounts, where users bet online on the outcome of any sort of live event, including casino games. Sports betting is seasonal whereas iGaming happens all year around, which makes it more lucrative for operators.&#xa0;</p> <p>While DraftKings is moving forward with more dealmaking, its earlier tie-up with <strong>SBTech</strong> has come under scrutiny following a <a href=\"https://hindenburgresearch.com/draftkings/\">report</a> by the short seller <strong>Hindenburg Research</strong>. The company recently announced it has been subpoenaed by the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the valuation for GNOG makes sense. Fertitta seems to think DraftKings got a cheap deal. “They underpaid for this and I woke up this morning struggling,” <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/08/09/draftkings-ceo-and-tilman-fertitta-on-golden-nugget-online-gaming-deal.html\">he told CNBC</a>, the business news channel.</p> <h2>Private equity takes the moral high ground</h2> <p>We told you <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfed9c06-c090-4404-9983-648c1dbaa045\">yesterday</a> about private equity's tussle with Big Tobacco for control of <strong>Vectura</strong>, a FTSE 250-listed company that sells inhalers.&#xa0;</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b860f52-ddf7-447b-bd74-c44b25a69da7\">latest twist</a>: the private equity bidder, <strong>Carlyle</strong>, is trying to win even with a lower-priced bid — by laying claim to the moral high ground.</p> <p>The firm said on Tuesday that its 155p-a-share offer, below rival <strong>Philip Morris International</strong>'s 165p bid, was final — calling a halt to a planned auction.&#xa0;</p> <p>Still, Carlyle urged shareholders to sacrifice the extra 10p a share from the maker of <strong>Marlboro </strong>cigarettes, in favour of a deal that it said would be better for “the company and its wider stakeholders”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Has private equity ever won a deal in this way?
