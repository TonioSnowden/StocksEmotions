  "title": "Altria Slashes Value of Juul by 70%; Marlboro maker's stake now values e-cigarette company at $1.3 billion, compared with $38 billion in 2018",
  "text": "<p>Altria Group Inc. slashed Thursday the value of its investment in Juul Labs Inc. by about 70% following the Food and Drug Administration's decision to order the e-cigarette company off the U.S. market.</p><p>The maker of Marlboro cigarettes now holds its Juul stake at a price that values the vaping company at about $1.3 billion, a fraction of the startup's $38 billion valuation when Altria bought a stake in 2018.</p><p>With the latest write-down, the stake for which Altria paid $12.8 billion in 2018 is now valued at $450 million.</p><p>The reduced valuation is below a level that allows Altria to exit a noncompete agreement and bring to market its own e-cigarettes. The tobacco giant said Thursday that for now, it had opted not to be released from that agreement because the arrangement was still beneficial to Altria. But the tobacco giant now has the freedom to explore acquisitions of other e-cigarette brands, Chief Executive Billy Gifford said Thursday on a call with analysts and reporters.</p><p>The noncompete agreement gives Altria board-designation rights and more voting power with its Juul shares than it would have if it asked to be released from the deal. Juul must also obtain Altria's consent for any sale of more than 4.9% of Juul's voting power or equity to a competitor of Altria.</p><p>Altria most recently had valued Juul at about $4.6 billion as of March 31.</p><p>The FDA in June ordered Juul to pull its e-cigarettes off the U.S. market, saying the vaping company hadn't submitted sufficient evidence that they were safe. The agency later said it would suspend its ban on Juul's products while the e-cigarette maker appeals the FDA's decision.</p><p>In court filings last month, Juul said the FDA overlooked more than 6,000 pages of data the company had submitted on the aerosols that users inhale. Juul also said the agency failed to consider the totality of Juul's evidence, which the company said established that the public-health benefits of Juul products significantly outweighed the potential risks.</p><p>\"We have the science and evidence to demonstrate that our products do, in fact, meet the statutory standard of being appropriate for the protection of the public health,\" a Juul spokesman said Thursday, referring to the standard that e-cigarette makers must meet for their products to stay on the U.S. market. In its appeal, Juul will address the issues raised by the FDA and show that Juul's products should be authorized, the spokesman said.</p><p>In writing down its Juul stake, Altria cited the unknown outcome of Juul's appeal and uncertainty around Juul's ability to maintain adequate liquidity.</p><p>Juul burned $123 million in cash in the first quarter of this year and had less than $300 million in cash on hand in late June, according to people familiar with the matter. Juul has been working with its legal advisers on options that include a possible bankruptcy filing, The Wall Street Journal has reported. The vaping company is also exploring financing options, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg News earlier reported that Juul was exploring financing options.</p><p>Juul's sales volume plummeted by 30% in the two weeks ended July 16 because of confusion around the FDA's order and the subsequent stay, according to Goldman Sachs analyst Bonnie Herzog. At the same time, Reynolds American Inc.'s Vuse brand, which has replaced Juul as the No. 1 e-cigarette in the U.S., gained market share. Meanwhile, the decline of Altria's cigarette sales slowed, Ms. Herzog said.</p><p>Altria's revenue fell 5.7% to $6.5 billion in the quarter ended June 30, as consumers facing higher prices for gas and other expenses bought fewer cigarettes or switched from Marlboro to discount brands.</p><p>Altria's 2018 investment in Juul was intended to help the company pivot to alternative products as cigarette sales declined.</p><p>The investment has been plagued with difficulties. Regulators and lawmakers, who blamed Juul for fueling a jump in underage vaping, cracked down on the vaping industry and the startup was hit with thousands of lawsuits. The Federal Trade Commission sued to unwind the deal. Juul's sales fell after it voluntarily stopped selling sweet and fruity flavors in the U.S. and halted most of its U.S. marketing. Now the vaping company's future is in question as it prepares to submit an appeal of the FDA's decision to order it off the market.</p><p>Juul has said it never targeted underage users and has been working to regain the trust of regulators and the public.</p><p>Altria said Thursday it continued to believe that e-cigarettes including Juul could play an important role in helping cigarette smokers switch to less-harmful alternatives.</p><p>Write to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com</p><p>Altria Slashes Value of Juul by 70%</p>",
