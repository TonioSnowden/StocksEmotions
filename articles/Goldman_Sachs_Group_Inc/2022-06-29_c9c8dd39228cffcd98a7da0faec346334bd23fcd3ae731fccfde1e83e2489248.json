The shares are down by half since the end of 2014, when Walgreens completed the buyout. </p> <p>Pessina stepped down as chief executive to become executive chair two years ago, as retailers saw business plunge amid coronavirus lockdowns. His successor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f8a017b-00dd-498f-a96a-c3ef0af2d06f\"><strong>Roz</strong> <strong>Brewer</strong></a>, the former <strong>Starbucks</strong> operating chief, is now tasked with unwinding the takeover entirely. </p> <p>The Boots sale process, run by <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, has been difficult for several months. </p> <p><strong>CVC</strong>, whose would-be bid was being overseen by <strong>Dominic Murphy</strong> — the man behind KKR's original 2007 buyout — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d40fb2b-9793-40e3-9c5f-707b311df0f9\">took itself out of the running</a> early on. </p> <p><strong>Bain</strong>, which was planning to bid with CVC, also passed on the opportunity, concerned that the deal might not generate good returns. </p> <p><strong>Mohsin </strong>and<strong> Zuber Issa</strong>, the billionaire brothers behind petrol station company <strong>EG Group</strong> and UK supermarket <strong>Asda</strong>, were also interested in Boots but never submitted a binding bid.</p> <p>That left a joint bid from <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> and <strong>Mukesh Ambani</strong>'s <strong>Reliance Industries</strong>, which was still being pursued into the weekend, sources told DD.</p> <p>But Walgreens pulled the plug, underwhelmed by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1b87c30-59a7-476f-8df4-8c2ffb064e76\">what was offered by Apollo</a> — not typically one to overpay for assets, especially with little competition.</p> <p><strong>Goldman</strong> <strong>Sachs</strong> has already had a tough time with UK retail deals after struggling to distribute the debt backing <strong>Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice</strong>'s takeover of <strong>Wm Morrison</strong>. </p> <p>Walgreens will remain on UK high streets for now. But has it missed its exit opportunity ahead of grim economic times on the horizon?</p> <p>There was a time just before the pandemic when KKR was considering a $70bn buyout of all of Walgreens, drawing caution from <strong>Blackstone</strong> chief <strong>Stephen</strong> <strong>Schwarzman</strong>, who questioned whether the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9824af60-049d-11ea-a984-fbbacad9e7dd\">industry could pull off such a big deal</a>.</p> <p>Now, as financing markets plumb lows reminiscent of the crisis era, the question is whether much of anything will get done this summer.</p> <h1>Europe's mad dash for Spac deals</h1> <p>European dealmakers may have caught Spac fever later than their Wall Street counterparts, but the symptoms have proven just as painful.</p> <p>DD readers are by now well-acquainted with characters such as <strong>Jean Pierre Mustier</strong>, the former <strong>UniCredit</strong> boss, and <strong>LVMH</strong> founder <strong>Bernard Arnault</strong>.</p> <p>The two Frenchmen <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f523768d-41af-492c-95b0-ff5d23a30539\">teamed up</a> last year with former <strong>Bank of America</strong> banker<strong> Diego De Giorgi</strong> and <strong>Tikehau Capital </strong>to launch <strong>Pegasus Europe</strong>, the continent's largest special purpose acquisition company, with their sights set on Europe's red-hot financial services sector.</p> <p>But more than a year after it raised €484mn in a listing in Amsterdam, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/240293a8-20ed-4cf3-a5ec-63dc1c2d9076\">go-to destination</a> for European Spacs at the time, Pegasus is among many of the continent's blank-cheque companies that have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d732fe11-e18b-4b8b-8432-27827d22040e\">failed to find a merger target</a>, the FT's Owen Walker and Sarah White report.</p> <p>The biggest obstacles to getting a deal done? Lofty fintech valuations that Mustier and De Giorgi were unwilling to meet, which made it difficult to agree on price. </p> <p>“The Pegasus Europe guys made two mistakes,” said one European investment banker involved in Spacs. “They raised too much money and they defined the scope [of the target] too narrowly.”</p> <p>Time is ticking for Pegasus and the 57 other European blank-cheque companies that have yet to find a target.</p> <p>Like most Spacs, Pegasus has two years from the date of its listing to nail down a merger. That gives it until next May, though it can seek shareholder approval for a six-month extension.</p> <p>Not all European Spacs are stuck in purgatory. In May, Tikehau and Arnault's separate vehicle <strong>Pegasus Entrepreneurs</strong> <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/06/22/2467452/0/en/Business-combination-of-Pegasus-Entrepreneurs-with-FL-Entertainment-secured-FL-Entertainment-expected-to-list-on-1st-July.html\">struck a deal</a> to list <em>Master Chef </em>and <em>Black Mirror</em> producer<strong> Banijay</strong>.</p> <p>And unlike most investors, Spac sponsors have been feeling optimistic about the recent market turmoil. As soaring inflation <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c0028ad-72a7-4176-8922-6729f6a3cc75\">dries up</a> the record amount of investment poured into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/fintech\">fintechs</a> in 2021, Pegasus could finally find a deal at a lower valuation. &#xa0;</p> <h1>A Big Four firm's big ‘no-no'</h1> <p>Here's a quick test for DD readers.</p> <p>Cheating is (a) bad, (b) very bad, or (c) even worse when you're in the business of holding other companies accountable. </p> <p>Jokes aside, <strong>EY</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2fd2a584-3e20-466b-98d7-d26a750aeb90\">has been fined</a> a record $100mn by the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> to resolve claims that dozens of its employees cheated on the ethics portion of the <strong>Certified Public Accountants</strong> exam. </p> <p>The SEC have very kindly summed up how bad this looks for EY: “It's simply outrageous that the very professionals responsible for catching cheating by clients cheated on ethics exams of all things,” said <strong>Gurbir Grewal</strong>, director of the SEC's enforcement division.</p> <p>Believe it or not, this isn't the first time employees at one of the Big Four have been caught cheating. <strong>KPMG </strong>paid a $50mn penalty in 2019 for exam cheating and illegal tip-offs. </p> <p>According to the SEC, EY has been fined twice that sum partly because it misled regulators when they made inquiries after the KPMG scandal. EY said nothing to the SEC or the <strong>Public Company Accounting Oversight Board</strong>, even while launching an internal investigation that confirmed instances of cheating. </p> <p>This is obviously terrible public relations for EY, which as DD readers know is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d715734c-701c-4c97-b0b3-44050f48f6b1\">weighing plans</a> to split its audit and advisory practices globally.</p> <p>EY said that its response to “this unacceptable past behaviour has been thorough, extensive, and effective”, adding that it would take steps to “strengthen” commitments to “compliance, ethics, and integrity”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Hopefully none of those steps are a multiple-choice exam. </p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>' co-chair of global M&amp;A <strong>Michael Carr </strong>is retiring after 25 years at the Wall Street investment bank, according to a memo seen by DD. He will stay on as an advisory director following his retirement.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Jupiter Fund Management</strong> chief executive <strong>Andrew Formica</strong> is retiring after only three years in the role, with the asset manager having underperformed its rivals. He will be replaced by its chief investment officer, <strong>Matthew Beesley</strong>, who joined from rival <strong>Artemis </strong>earlier this year. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04a7024d-c339-4cb8-82ae-af05f4ce12c9\">More here</a> from Lex.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Akash Ambani</strong> has been named chair of his father Mukesh Ambani's<strong> Reliance Jio</strong>, marking the beginning of a succession plan within one of Asia's wealthiest families.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Walt Disney</strong>'s board <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/6eb1016e-78cb-4a65-b871-c3095f07bc51\">has voted unanimously</a> to extend<strong> Bob Chapek</strong>'s contract as chief executive for three years.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>McDonald's</strong> has named <strong>Ian Borden</strong> as its chief financial officer, effective in September.
