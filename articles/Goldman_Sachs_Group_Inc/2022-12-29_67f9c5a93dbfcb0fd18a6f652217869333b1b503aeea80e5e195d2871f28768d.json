Heather Boushey, a member of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, told the FT that although there were “challenges”, new legislation would be “pushing in the other direction”. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a05016c1-3365-4e08-91ea-314d278e830e\">Read the full story</a>.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Negative Covid tests required for China travellers</strong> The US is to <a href=\"http://email.newsletters.ft.com/c/eJyNkkGPFCEQhX_NcKsJFDQNhz6YmE08qz-ggKpd4kz3CIwT_73suurVhAMk9d5H3iu-Ur18KptO6FfkBXzQK7iIEQITgtdGTGInwReVafDz0X5uOz_6hcfgpm7tKPc8tn6j9g0G96F4M9MLvYsWVdkkuSio-nFvmbder7cLA79yoXP7UTOruqFGNIgBUWvtz-KWTClFLFbYOT45_Y_ZzzLO-biql02WHEXyVGEJfnGSJAiJzToUXDWrVPdS9-eNSx1Hq3RRl-1ljFs_2Q8nfJrn8Xi8-81HPvbB-5g3St6v1hUgiQxO_AK0ogPGGF3GhcoaTvaJf-d3sh__J8ET-s7P10l4k3hNBj0HKPPHkJZpn-MaQaJOhQP5NRd1qX1Ob4vPxGKCs06K11ZrwTXrRbWtU6OXM6ed28zpPZvG3-_8piRrbDbBQOJI4AxrIGtfn7a4tZgZlVeDZy2z3jkvtfUBMoB6JXWfHX2917khJiaTHMISYwQ3VZDWmGF2G8guszpd_lC5fOa9fKnXv6sQ9GQ02jvlUY_9FZNskGQC4GKnX3AJCJmAs9XirRFt7S_hxcv0\">require negative Covid-19 tests</a> for air passengers travelling from China as countries rushed to impose restrictions after the abrupt end of Beijing's zero-Covid containment policy resulted in a surge in cases. The measures are intended to “slow the spread” of the virus in the US following the surge in China and are being implemented because of “the lack of adequate and transparent epidemiological and viral genomic sequence data being reported from” Beijing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Related read:</strong> Hong Kong has <a href=\"http://email.newsletters.ft.com/c/eJyNksGuGyEMRb8m7ByBYRhYsKhUPanrth9gwOShTmZSII369yWvr-22Egss-fpY95qvVLdPOciIdkVewDq5gvHowTEhWKmKimyKs1kkGnw52s-w86NvPAY3cWtHvqcR-o3aNxjch-Cg5iy0xmsUOZRofEHRj3tLHHq93jYGfnKhc_tRE4saUCIqRIcopbTnYpZEMXrMurAxfDLyH7Ofyzin4ypegzRkVuVZEpWsyMpYjNHOrRi9S4pFrHuu-yVwruNolTaxhdcxbv2kP5zwZb7H4_E-bxbp2AfvY_7IOF9yQlgjMhhnEHz0CspckbONE8Un_cK__Tvpj__j4Alt58t1Et4kVpJCyw5y0QniggaSXz0UL2NmR3ZNWWy1z-6w2ERclDPalGyllrLgmuQiWujU6PXMcec2fXr3pvH3O78pSSudlFMQ2RMYxRJI62eps1mzki5bMXjGMuOd_aW2PqAMoF5J3GdGX-91XojyUcVpw-K9BzNVEFefYGbrSC8zOpn_UDl_5j1_qde_p-DkZDTaO6VRj_2JidqVqBzgov3T4AiETMBJy2K1KlLrX_Ray30\">dropped almost all of its remaining Covid-19 restrictions</a> and scrapped compulsory testing for arrivals as the city aims to revive its pandemic-hit economy and catch up with Beijing's abrupt exit from zero-Covid.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>3. ‘Moron premium' looms over the UK economy</strong> The damaging effects of Liz Truss's radical economic experiment are still being felt in the UK, more than two months after she resigned as prime minister, writes our economics expert Chris Giles. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7bad4783-e6d1-4776-8fa7-4188bbb9d86f\">Find out what they are</a>.</p> <p><strong>4.

Employees of embattled tech groups are flooding secondary markets — where stakeholders in a private company sell shares to third parties — as the industry's former darlings like Klarna and Stripe have been forced into aggressive cost-cutting measures, according to brokers and investors.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Opinion: </strong>Silicon Valley once set the standard for corporate success with a simple strategy: innovate rapidly and splash out to woo customers.

It includes human resources executives, government bureaucrats, regulators, socialists, Harvard graduates, Harvard MBAs, lawyers, accountants, Joe Biden, the media and “the woke people”. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5680bb94-4fda-4bb5-887a-62ca1b4341fd\">Find out why he's worried about capitalism</a>.</p> <p><strong>China begins to reopen after three years of isolation </strong>While China is being hit by an unprecedented wave of Covid-19 cases, the world's second-largest economy is starting to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f2170ab-3c59-4659-bb15-a7e722f1f129\">show signs of coming back to life</a>, and an outgoing tourism boom is predicted. However, the prospect of an influx of Chinese travellers potentially carrying the virus — as well as possible future variants — has already led countries including the US, Italy, Japan and India to institute testing requirements for Chinese arrivals.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>First person:</strong> Having dodged the virus for nearly three years, it was ironically in Beijing — Xi Jinping's zero-Covid citadel — that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa047a9a-a86e-416c-8d7a-56e7fbeca502\">it finally caught up with me</a>, the FT's Asia news editor Joe Leahy writes.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Subscription box companies struggle to adjust to life after lockdowns</strong> During the pandemic, receiving a home-cooking meal kit was both an evening activity and a way to avoid heading to the grocery store.
