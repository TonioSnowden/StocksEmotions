  "text": "<p>Cerberus is an active investor in the region's fragmented financial-services industry through its funds. It has taken stakes in Deutsche Bank AG, HSH Nordbank and other lenders—with mixed success—and buys portfolios of nonperforming loans and other assets.</p><p>Mr. Horta-Osório was lauded in European finance for turning around the U.K.'s Lloyds Banking Group PLC as chief executive, and received a British knighthood in 2021. For nine months, he oversaw a strategy shift at Credit Suisse following the collapse of two clients, Archegos Capital Management and Greensill Capital.</p><p>He had to resign from the Credit Suisse chairman's role this year, following a board investigation into his travel and personal conduct. Some of the travel breached Covid-19-related government rules, which Mr. Horta-Osório said was unintentional.</p><p>Credit Suisse said in July it would make fresh changes to its strategy after reporting three consecutive quarterly losses and failing to win over investors.</p><p>That month, Mr. Horta-Osório took a role as a senior adviser at Italy's Mediobanca Banca di Credito Finanziario SpA. In Portugal, his native country, conglomerate Impresa recently hired him as vice chairman, and he joined the board of family-held José de Mello Group in September.</p><p>The banker has longstanding ties to industrial magnates and financiers from his previous positions. He spent almost two decades at Banco Santander SA and worked at Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. early in his career.</p><p>He is on the board of Brazilian billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann's investment vehicle, INPAR, and previously was a director at the Agnelli family holding company, EXOR NV.</p><p>Write to Margot Patrick at margot.patrick@wsj.com</p><p>António Horta-Osório Adds Cerberus Role to Post-Credit Suisse Portfolio</p>",
