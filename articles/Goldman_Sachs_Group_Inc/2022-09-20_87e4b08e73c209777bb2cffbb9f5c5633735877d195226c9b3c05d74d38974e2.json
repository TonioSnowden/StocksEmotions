  "text": "<p>The consensus expects the index's net profit margins to climb to a new high of 12.8% in 2023, according to FactSet data, but Goldman strategists believe these forecasts are \"too optimistic and will be cut\".</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 ended last week below the 3,900 level, which was viewed as an important area of technical support and could trigger a deeper slide to the index's 2022 low at 3,666.77 set on June 16. The S&amp;P 500 SPX suffered a 4.8% weekly fall, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA logged a 4.1% drop and the Nasdaq Composite COMP declined 5.5%.</p><p>See: 'Some twisted logic about valuation multiples': Stock-market investors appear complacent as rates rise, warns Morgan Stanley</p><p>Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson, one of the Wall Street's most vocal bears who correctly predicted this year's stock market selloff, suggested that \"reality\" has not been priced in yet, as \"investors may face a volatile path in the absence of an 'event' to clear the decks\".</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 rallied off the June lows and reached a high of 4,305 in mid-August, but then the retreated back below its 50-day moving average (see chart below). According to strategists led by Wilson, it is not a good sign.</p><p>\"We are oversold again and that means bear market rallies can continue to occur in the absence of a market clearing event that forces capitulatory behavior,\" wrote Wilson in a Monday note. \"We remain bearish both fundamentally and technically on a 3-month basis, more neutral on a 9-12 month basis and open minded on a day-to-day basis.\"</p><p>\"With that backdrop, we continue to recommend owning more defensively oriented companies with earnings stability and high operational efficiency,\" he added.</p><p>See: Stocks may be headed for more pain as second half of September is historically 'very bearish'</p><p>U.S. stocks opened sharply lower on Tuesday, as investors await the central bank's meeting that's expected to result in another supersize rate increase.
