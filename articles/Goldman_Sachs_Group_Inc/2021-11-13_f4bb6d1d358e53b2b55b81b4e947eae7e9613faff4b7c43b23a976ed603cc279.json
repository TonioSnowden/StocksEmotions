  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Bullish Options Activity Centers on Tech",
  "text": "<p>Many traders have turned to options to bet on tech stocks. Around half of all options activity in October was tied to shares of Tesla Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. alone, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Much of the bullish call-options activity has been concentrated in stocks within the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index, according to Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Many investors have also turned to the options market to profit from the continued rally in stocks including Nvidia Corp., Qualcomm Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. All three of those stocks are up more than 18% this month, compared with the S&amp;P 500's roughly 1.7% advance. They notched gains this past week and defied the Nasdaq Composite's 0.7% loss.</p><p>Options can magnify bullish or bearish bets by allowing investors to put down a relatively small sum of cash for an outsize return if their bets prove to be correct. The contracts have become a popular way for investors to ride the nearly relentless momentum in the stock market higher and higher, at times piling into the same popular trades.</p><p>Some traders and strategists have said that the heavy trading activity can exacerbate stock moves, leading to bigger rallies while potentially making market swoons sharper when they do appear.</p><p>The frenzied options activity in recent weeks shows how many investors are positioning for stocks to keep rising even after the S&amp;P 500 hit more than 60 fresh highs this year and gained 25%.</p><p>\"I definitely expect them to go up,\" said Sharita Glass, a 51-year-old individual trader in Jacksonville, Fla., on stocks.</p><p>Ms. Glass started trading last year, and since then stocks have steadily risen, making call options tied to tech stocks such as Apple Inc. and Amazon one of her favored strategies. When stocks are falling, she typically shies away from trading.</p><p>\"During this period of time of me learning about the stock market, it was heavily in the green most days,\" Ms. Glass said. She said she recently sold out of her Apple and Amazon call options to pour money into the Shiba Inu coin cryptocurrency.</p><p>Options trading has soared this year and, by one measure, hit a fresh high in October. More than $890 billion of single-stock options changed hands on Oct. 29, the highest level ever, according to Goldman data. And activity in the options market has continued to eclipse stock trading, based on the notional value of options changing hands.</p><p>Tesla's recent lurch higher coincided with a burst of activity in the options market. At times, almost one out of every two dollars spent in the listed U.S. options market went toward Tesla bets.</p><p>\"This can drive more pronounced trends and momentum than you would otherwise see,\" said Greg Boutle, head of U.S. equity and derivative strategy at BNP Paribas. But he said, \"There is a risk that if people step back from that for whatever reason, it could exacerbate a reversal.\"</p>",
