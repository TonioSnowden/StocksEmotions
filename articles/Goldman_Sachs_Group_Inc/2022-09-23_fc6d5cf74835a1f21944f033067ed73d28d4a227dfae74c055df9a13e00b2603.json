The 5-year rate BX:TMUBMUSD05Y also broke through 4% on Friday, but failed to hold on to that level.Wednesday's interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve and hawkish comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell have led to an aggressive readjustment of expectations in markets, pushing the 2-, 10- and 30-year yields to multiyear highs this week. The ICE Dollar Index DXY also continued to shoot up to its highest levels of the past 20 years on Friday.</p><p>Market participants remain concerned that the U.S. economy may slip into recession as the Fed could go too far in its monetary tightening cycle. U.S. stocks slumped further on Friday and headed for weekly losses. Meanwhile, the spreads between 2- and 10-year yields went further below zero, to as little as minus 53 basis points at one point, in an ominous sign for the economic outlook.</p><p>Need to Know: Growling Powell causes Goldman to cut its S&amp;P 500 price target.
