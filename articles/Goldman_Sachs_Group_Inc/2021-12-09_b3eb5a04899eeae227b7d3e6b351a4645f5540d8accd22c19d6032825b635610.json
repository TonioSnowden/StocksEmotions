  "text": "<p>British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday announced COVID-19 passes would be mandatory for entry into nightclubs or large venues and urged individuals to once again work from home. The government has warned of cases doubling every two or three days.</p><p>Sven Jari Stehn, economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a note on Wednesday that given that new information on the omicron variant is trickling out slowly right now, “it is difficult to have strong conviction for the outcome of the upcoming MPC meeting.” The Bank of England's Monetary Policy meeting is scheduled for Dec. 16.</p><p>“Previously, we had thought a 15[basis point] hike in December was more likely than not, but this was a close call. We now think risk management considerations will dominate in next week's [monetary policy committee] deliberations,” said Stehn, in a note.</p><p>Meanwhile travel-related stocks were trading lower in London. Expectations of more restrictions around the globe were weighing on the sector, despite, Pfizer's PFE assessment that three vaccines can “neutralize” the omicron variant — based on an early, lab study, said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at&#xa0;IG.</p><p>“The U.K.'s move to new restrictions points toward the expected playbook for the weeks to come, and could well put some pressure on equity markets in what is normally a fairly positive time,” Beauchamp wrote in a note.</p><p>Shares of International Consolidated Airlines UK:IAG fell 3.7%, InterContinental Hotels UK:IHGIHG shares were down 2%. Wizz Air UK:WIZZ shares fell 3.7%. Rolls-Royce UK:RR shares also declined top decliner, despite a trading update from the aeroengine manufacturing company.</p><p>Rolls-Royce said it restored positive free cash flow in the third quarter and a gradual recovery international flying, alongside a market recovery for its power systems were helping to drive that performance. The stock has lost 16% in the past month, noted Beauchamp.</p><p>On the move higher were shares of Moonpig UK:MOON, up over 2% after the recently floated online greeting-card and gift platform&#xa0;said Thursday first-half 2022 pretax profit fell on lower revenue, but sees full-year revenue to be at the upper end of guidance.</p>",
