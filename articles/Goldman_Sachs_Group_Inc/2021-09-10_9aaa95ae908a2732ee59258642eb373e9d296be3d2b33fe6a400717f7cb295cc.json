White House officials have said 80m people, about half of the US workforce, would be covered by the mandate, though the plan has yet to be finalised by the Department of Labor.</p> <p>A separate executive order will require federal government employees and contractors to be vaccinated, a measure that will affect about 2.5m people.</p> <p>The moves came as the number of new Covid-19 cases in the US reached<a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailycases\"> about 140,000 a day</a>, a level last seen in the spring before vaccines were universally available. Despite plentiful supplies, the US jab rate is <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker/?areas=gbr&amp;areas=isr&amp;areas=usa&amp;areas=eue&amp;areas=can&amp;areas=chn&amp;areas=ind&amp;cumulative=1&amp;doses=total&amp;populationAdjusted=1\">lower</a> than that of many European countries.</p> <p>President Biden expressed frustration at some people's reluctance to get inoculated. “Our patience is wearing thin,” he said. “Your refusal has cost all of us.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Although many congressional Republicans oppose the new rules — Elise Stefanik, chair of the Republican conference in the House of Representatives, has called them “illegal mandates from a power hungry government” — several businesses have independently introduced similar measures. They include investment bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eed019a6-903f-4cfc-aaa1-777f00fa148a\">Goldman Sachs</a> and professional services firm Deloitte, while this week it emerged that oil major <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4edfefb-4fba-46d9-bef3-2cfdba57bdb3\">Royal Dutch Shell</a> had considered doing so.</p> <p><em>Sign up for the </em><a href=\"https://healthcare.live.ft.com/?reference=firstus&amp;utm_source=bem&amp;utm_medium=firstus&amp;utm_campaign=2021pfutureofamericanhealthcare\"><em>FT Future of American Healthcare</em></a><em> event on September 14 to hear FT journalists, policymakers and business leaders discuss how US healthcare is developing, from prospects for legislation and reform to the rise of telehealth and the evolution of hospitals.</em></p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p>While Biden gets tough on vaccination, the <strong>US Federal Reserve could soon crack down on inflation</strong>, according to an FT poll of leading academic economists. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a7a4edd-b656-4d6a-b608-454241d0288e\">survey</a>, conducted in partnership with the FT by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, suggests a much more aggressive approach to tightening pandemic-era monetary policy than the Fed's most recent projections. Just over 70 per cent of respondents believe that the Fed will raise rates by at least a quarter of a percentage point in 2022 — far earlier than the 2023 lift-off from today's near-zero levels that Fed officials pencilled in back in June.</p> <p>Complicating the picture for Fed policymakers, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a804c0c-791c-48cb-be09-872788f71451\">US Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week</a> that <strong>the unemployment rate for black Americans</strong> ticked up to 8.8 per cent in August, despite the same measure for US workers overall declining to 5.2 per cent. Fed chair Jay Powell has said he is watching racial divergences in the job market as he makes policy decisions. The new data could indicate that historical disparities in unemployment rates are persisting, despite a narrowing of the gap between black and white workers in the labour market before the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>The <strong>European Central Bank</strong> said yesterday that it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8a78a9f-8e81-403a-a1be-9ad8e6199e72\">buy fewer bonds</a>, in a sign of confidence in the eurozone's economic recovery. After a two-day meeting of its governing council, the bank announced that its €1.85tn pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP) would run at a “moderately lower pace” from the €80bn-a-month level it had sustained since March. The decision follows a strong <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22265aff-1593-4658-942c-9170bfe28b94\">rebound</a> in eurozone growth and inflation.</p> <p>The outlook across the Channel is less bright. The <strong>UK's Office for National Statistics</strong> said today that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a2ed9e3-545b-4b38-81b6-1d0d4bedbdd0\">output rose just 0.1 per cent in July</a> compared with the previous month, well below the 1 per cent expansion in June and weaker than the 0.6 per cent growth forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. It was the weakest monthly performance since January and left gross domestic product 2.1 per cent below February 2020 levels, the last full month before the pandemic hit.</p> <h1>Business</h1> <p><strong>EasyJet</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c2d5a82-c548-4f5a-aa06-3ad250855e72\">rejected a takeover approach</a> from Hungarian rival <strong>Wizz Air</strong>, saying that the board “had no hesitation in rejecting” the proposed “low premium and highly conditional all-share deal”. Wizz Air's move could be the first sign of a potential <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58f4394f-af0f-45ef-80c0-8403eb05b882\">wave of consolidation</a> in Europe's airline industry as it emerges from the pandemic, says FT acting transport correspondent Philip Georgiadis.</p> <p>Also emerging from the pandemic is southern Europe's <strong>holiday industry</strong>, with a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3062679-88c7-49e8-be91-498b6894a317\">surge in visitors</a> that has exceeded operators' expectations. In July, about 2.4m air passengers travelled to and from Mallorca, Spain — more than double the number in the same month in 2020, but still more than 40 per cent down on pre-pandemic 2019. Greek air traffic in August was about 90 per cent of the level for the same month in 2019.</p> <p>British genomics company <strong>Oxford Nanopore</strong> has unveiled plans for an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0d77f75-d619-4b2b-9030-f22bfce4d8f8\">initial public listing</a> on the London Stock Exchange. Spun out of the University of Oxford in 2005, the company makes DNA sequencing devices that have become essential in identifying and tracking the spread of Covid-19 variants around the world. Analysts said the listing could value it at about £4bn.</p> <p><strong>Top Glove</strong>, the world's biggest manufacturer of rubber gloves and one of the corporate success stories of the pandemic, can <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e46bde0-355e-46fb-920b-f059fc5b84b5\">once again sell its products in the US</a> after an import ban imposed following allegations of forced labour was lifted. The news sent the Malaysian company's shares up by as much as 10 per cent in early trading before falling back and will allow it to relaunch a proposed $1bn dual listing in Hong Kong.</p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p><strong>Stock markets</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a0e7b4a-851e-4fbb-8ee5-ef8a4a7f7c8f\">rose worldwide earlier today</a>, as hopes of a thaw in US-China relations offset investor uncertainty over central banks' withdrawal of pandemic-era support. News of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5527d9e5-ed0d-416d-8bd2-e9b12732f16d\">call</a> between US president Joe Biden and Chinese president Xi Jinping helped nudge up the Stoxx Europe 600 and FTSE 100 in early trading, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.9 per cent. </p> <p><strong>Investor uncertainty</strong> is a current theme in the UK, says FT columnist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4029852-ad8d-420f-b129-4b15b2801410\">Merryn Somerset Webb</a>. The Conservative government's recent tax rise, its high spending and the Bank of England's “endless money printing” are all disconcertingly reminiscent of the 1970s, she says. In such woozy times, the best bet for the British equity investor may be small caps, which “have had a tremendous year”, with the FTSE Small Cap index up nearly 50 per cent in the past year. Sometimes, it seems, it pays to think small.</p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p><em>DarkMatter</em> has no doubts about Shell's right to consider a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4edfefb-4fba-46d9-bef3-2cfdba57bdb3?commentID=ac43d044-10b4-4e8a-8202-05f3a3f8d4a7\">vaccine mandate</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Companies have the right to require their employees to be vaccinated. They need to protect their employees from non-vaccinated individuals. Those who do not comply should be terminated. Employees do not have the right to endanger their coworkers. </p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong> may be cutting-edge in technological terms, but they also have many of the trappings of a quasi-mystical cult, according to Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan and Robin Wigglesworth. They take a fascinating dive into the world of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e787670-6aa7-4479-934f-f4a9fedf4829\">crypto diehards</a> in this weekend's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/magazine\">FT Magazine</a>.</p><p>Source: Neville Hawcock 2021 'Biden cracks down with Covid vaccine mandates' FT.com 10 September.
