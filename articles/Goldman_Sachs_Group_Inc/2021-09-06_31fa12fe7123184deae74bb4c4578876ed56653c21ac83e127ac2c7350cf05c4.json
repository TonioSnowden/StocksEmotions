  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs plans to cash in on the global boom for private equity by listing Petershill Partners, which buys stakes in alternative asset managers, in a deal that could value the portfolio at more than $5bn.</p> <p>Petershill Partners, which owns minority stakes in 19 alternative asset companies with a combined $187bn of assets under management, said on Monday that it was considering an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. </p> <p>A flotation would make it the largest listed alternatives business in London.</p> <p>If it goes ahead, the IPO plans to raise $750m by issuing new ordinary shares, giving Petershill more firepower to make acquisitions. Separately, it will also sell existing ordinary shares to achieve a free float of 25 per cent, meaning it can be included on the FTSE index. </p> <p>The listing is set to value the entire business at north of $5bn and would probably take place in a month, according to people familiar with the situation.</p> <p>When Petershill was set up by the Wall Street bank in 2007, it was the first of a series of groups created to take stakes in private equity and alternative investment managers, seeking to benefit from the recurring revenue streams of management and performance fees that they generate. Competitors include Dyal Capital, Blackstone's Strategic Capital Holdings and AlpInvest Partners.</p> <p>The planned Petershill IPO is further evidence of Goldman chief executive David Solomon's determination to grow the US bank in areas that earn regular fees, such as asset and wealth management, while reducing its reliance on volatile businesses including equities and bond trading. Last month it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd064398-2030-4260-84e3-f442d42cd2d1\">bought the asset management arm</a> of Dutch insurer NN Group for €1.6bn.</p> <p>Investors have been increasing their exposure to private equity and private debt in a search for returns in an environment of low interest rates. Assets in the overall alternatives industry are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 9.8 per cent, from $10.7tn in 2020 to $17.2tn by 2025, according to data provider Preqin.</p> <p>Petershill's earnings distributable to partners have more than doubled from $108m in 2018 to $243m in 2020, and reached $310m for the 12 months to June 30, according to the company.</p> <p>Its 19 minority investments in alternative companies were previously held in funds managed by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. </p> <p>Petershill is part of the alternatives business within GSAM. Goldman had $402bn in alternative assets at the end of the second quarter and covers private equity, real assets, private credit, hedge funds and alternative risk premia.&#xa0;</p> <p>Last year Solomon combined&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ef9ffe2-12a3-11ea-a225-db2f231cfeae\">Goldman's merchant bank</a>&#xa0;with its traditional asset management business. The&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5cb6d932-2057-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b\">expanded division</a>&#xa0;now encompasses everything from Goldman's proprietary&#xa0;investments made with its own balance sheet, to funds managed on behalf of third-party investors. This is an area that the chief executive has earmarked for growth, as part of the US bank's desire to become more like US alternatives platform Blackstone.</p> <p>According to Goldman's annual report last year, it raised $40bn in alternatives from third-party investors — it is targeting $150bn in fundraising&#xa0;over five years.</p> <p>Petershill's holdings include Caxton Associates, one of the world's oldest and best-known hedge funds, Ross Turner's Pelham Capital and technology buyout firm Accel-KKR.</p> <p>The company has appointed an independent board led by chair Naguib Kheraj, the former Barclays finance director who is also chair of specialist pensions insurer Rothesay Life and deputy chair of Standard Chartered.</p> <p>In its 14-year history, Petershill has raised and deployed $8.5bn of capital across a broad range of strategies including private equity, private credit, private real assets and absolute return.</p> <p>About four-fifths of Petershill's assets are in private markets managers and the remainder in hedge fund strategies. The majority of new acquisitions are expected to be in private capital managers, and it is targeting sectors like technology, healthcare and ESG that are likely to benefit as the world emerges from the pandemic.</p> <p>Ali Raissi, co-head of the Petershill group, said in a statement that “this IPO would be a natural next step in the evolution of the offering to partner firms”.</p> <p>The firm's other co-head, Robert Hamilton Kelly, said the deal “would provide shareholders with access to the growth and profitability of the alternatives industry” and give investors exposure to “the economics of a highly cash-generative company that benefits from stable, long-term fee-related earnings”.</p> <p>The Financial Times reported last month that the five biggest listed US private capital companies had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d85c0a3-8f52-4b43-8fa7-36c0391562de\">more than tripled</a> in combined value since the depths of last year's market sell-off, as investors have sought to benefit from the hefty fees they rake in from the boom in unlisted assets.</p> <p>In July, UK-based Bridgepoint Advisers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/181f6b11-9dad-4e92-b2e8-52cc9a43090b\">raised £300m</a> in another London IPO and the stock of the buyout group has risen 12 per cent since.</p><p>Source: Harriet Agnew and Stephen Morris in London 2021 'Goldman Sachs plans IPO for $5bn Petershill Partners' FT.com 6 September.
