  "title": "China's Private Developers Abstain From Land Auctions as 'Red Lines' Draw Blood; Regulatory limits on borrowing and a concerted push to rein in debt-fueled property market threaten key driver of economic growth",
  "text": "<p>The results from auctions in 22 major cities over the past three months show that after years of government messaging and ad hoc measures aimed at cooling the debt-fueled real-estate sector, the latest policies are biting—and drawing blood—in an industry that by some reckoning accounts for a third of China's economic output.</p><p>Painting a wider and gloomier picture, Beijing-based China Index Academy's research shows that across 300 Chinese cities, local governments' land revenues fell 7% in fiscal 2021, reversing an 18% increase in 2020 and falling to the lowest level since 2014.</p><p>To be sure, broader-based Finance Ministry figures published last month show revenue from land sales and related income rising 3.5% last year. Still, that is the smallest growth in five years and a significant slowdown from 2020's 15.9% increase.</p><p>While state-owned enterprises and local government financing vehicles stepped in to fill the gap in the market vacated by developers, the private sector has long been the driver that has pushed auction prices higher. Without the private developers in the bidding mix, the average premium that buyers paid was 2.6% over the asking price in the latest round, down from 14.7% immediately before the clampdown, according to real-estate data company Beijing Zhuge House Hunter Information Technology Co.</p><p>\"Cash-strapped private developers have been struck by the 'three red lines' policy and have no money to bid,\" says Zhang Kai, director of China Index Academy's department overseeing land sales. \"State-owned enterprises have to fill the gap left by private developers to save the market and support local governments.\"</p><p>China Vanke Co., one of the nation's biggest private developers, bought the rights to just three new projects in December, with a gross floor area of 384,000 square meters, or 4.1 million square feet. That compares with its 34 new projects covering 5.3 million square meters a year earlier, according to Hong Kong stock exchange filings.</p><p>And that all points to a longer shift toward moderating prices at auction—with knock-on impacts on local government revenues.</p><p>China's local authorities have long used land sales to fill their coffers, which contributed more than 40% of their revenue excluding direct transfers from the central government, according to official data. Two decades of rising land prices have provided the cash flow needed to finance a pyramid of debt, much—and possibly most—of which is hidden off balance sheet. Any long-term drop in auction revenue will threaten their ability to service those debts.</p><p>A squeeze in local government budgets will also sting at a time when Beijing is looking to them to provide more social services as part of Mr. Xi's broader \"common prosperity\" drive.</p><p>In China, all land is publicly owned—by the state in urban areas and by village collectives in rural zones. Local land auctions aren't for ownership, but for long-term land usage rights, with all revenue going into the pockets of the local authorities.</p><p>While real estate revenues have declined before—dropping 6% as recently as 2015, China Index Academy data show—the latest crackdown has been effective after years of government talk, with features that analysts have said are longer term in nature.</p><p>In addition to the \"three red lines,\" which capped assets-to-liabilities, debt-to-equity and cash-to-short-term debt ratios, authorities early last year overhauled the auction system. The country's 22 biggest cities now hold three discrete rounds of land sales each year, rather than dribbling out lots. The move sought to rein in reckless borrowing by developers to fund bids on unpredictable land supplies, as well as to weed out weaker companies.</p><p>Those policy shifts, coupled with private property developers' withdrawal from the market and the continuing burden of China's strict pandemic controls, now threaten to further destabilize the balance sheets of local governments.</p><p>\"Weaker growth in tax revenue and an outright drop in land sales revenue will both weigh on regional and local governments,\" says Jack Yuan, a senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service. \"Fiscal deficits will remain large.\"</p><p>At least so far, private property developers' exit from the land-auction market has been offset in part by state-owned property developers and local government financing vehicles—entities set up to fund infrastructure projects.</p><p>The central government's willingness to allow these vehicles to prop up land auctions may have limits, however. Local governments set up the entities as a workaround to evade earlier borrowing caps. They now represent a major reservoir of hidden debt—more than $8 trillion worth at the end of 2020, equivalent to more than half of China's annual economic output—according to Goldman Sachs.</p><p>The intervention of state-backed bidders helped mitigate the impact of the private sector's withdrawal from the latest auctions, with 17.8% of lots unsold compared with 41% in the second round. In the first round, only 8% of land parcels were unsold.</p><p>But for local authorities, weaker land sales revenue will still intensify \"the policy dilemma between supporting growth and deleveraging, and especially so in less developed provinces with weaker fundamentals,\" says Moody's Mr. Yuan.</p><p>In the northeastern city of Changchun, where temperatures this time of year can fall as low as minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit, more than 80% of land parcels put up for sale by the city went unsold in the latest auctions, according to official data.</p><p>Faced with the troubling signals from the land-auction market and other economic indicators, Beijing has shifted in recent weeks toward easing some regulations.</p><p>China's central bank lowered its benchmark lending rates in December and January, encouraging banks to extend more home loans while making it easier for cash-strapped property developers to unload distressed assets.</p><p>Even so, analysts at Fitch Ratings expect land sales to remain weak this year, as a projected 10% to 15% decline in new-home sales deters developers from replenishing their land banks.</p><p>While many analysts believe Beijing will further relent in its property crackdown as the economic pain mounts, market sentiment likely won't recover quickly.</p><p>\"Policy has bottomed out, but it will take some time before the market bottoms out,\" Mr. Zhang said.</p><p>Bingyan Wang and Xiao Xiao contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com</p><p>China's Private Developers Abstain From Land Auctions as 'Red Lines' Draw Blood</p>",
