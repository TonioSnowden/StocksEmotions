  "text": "<p>Hello all and sundry, and welcome to another issue of FintechFT. I hope those of you in the UK managed to avoid too much Jubilee monarchical madness (unless that's your cup of tea) and the rest of you got some insight into this Sceptred Isle.</p> <p>This week, Akila Quinio in Paris talks European tech valuations, the US brings its first legal action regarding insider trading for an NFT and I talk to Marc-Alexander Christ at mobile point of sale provider SumUp.</p> <p>Thoughts or feedback on today's newsletter?

Reach Imani at <a href=\"mailto:imani.moise@ft.com\">imani.moise@ft.com</a>. </p> <p><em>PS I'll be interviewing Jonas Templestein</em>, <em>the co-founder of Monzo Bank, at the FT Future of Finance summit on June 16-17. We'll be live-streaming from the heart of Europe's leading tech festival, The Next Web (TNW).&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://on.ft.com/3iqcsaQ\"><em>Register for&#xa0;free&#xa0;today</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>After record-breaking quarter, fintech funds face prospect of drying up &#xa0;</h1> <p>Marc Menasé has not come across filings for a challenger bank's funding round in a long time. The French chief executive of Founders Future, who backed his country's leading “superapp” Lydia, is expecting a downturn in fintech valuations, “just like everywhere else”. </p> <p>On the face of it, European fundraising looks strong. Across the continent, fintech fundraising hit new records in the first quarter of the year — up 9 per cent from its previous peak, according to Dealroom data. This is despite global fundraising being down 10 per cent from its all-time high in the same quarter. Italy even welcomed its first unicorn since the dotcom boom, with buy now, pay later Scalapay raising $497mn in February.</p> <p>But the delayed nature of investing, with deals closing three to five months after they have been filed, means that record-breaking fundraising figures out of Europe could be concealing a cloudier outlook as investors expect cheaper valuations in the coming months. </p> <p>European investors could soon feel the domino effect from US public markets and crossover funds that had placed bets on fintech. Already, this has resulted in delayed negotiations and sometimes cheaper valuations than what would have been expected six months ago.</p> <p>Another example came when Europe's most valuable fintech company, the Swedish payments group Klarna, announced last month that it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d49fcc62-43a3-4a84-8e4a-e57f28e8386c\">cutting 10 per cent of its workforce</a> following speculation that it was planning to raise money at a much lower valuation.</p> <p>Some think this type of course correction is necessary in a sector where valuations have soared. </p> <p>“So many entrepreneurs in Europe want to disrupt one segment of fintech without looking at the market at large,” says Menasé. “It is a healthy correction for all of those ‘nice to have' fintechs, especially series B and above”.</p> <p>Behind the record-high fundraising figures, a proliferation of Web3 and crypto deals has also been pushing the numbers up.</p> <p>Deals in blockchain companies jumped 77 per cent compared to the last quarter; their total amounts accounted for 18 per cent of the global share of crypto deals in the first quarter of the year, according to data provider CB insights.</p> <p>“Web3 very clearly characterised most of our deal flow in fintech for the first quarters [of the year], with two main thematic categories being infrastructures and more vertical projects around NFTs and NFT transaction,” said Menasé.</p> <p>But beyond the apparent buzz, the sector is not immune to a slowdown in the coming months either, warns Ivan de Lastours, who leads BPI France's blockchain branch. Web3 is still perceived as “a little more risky,” he says. </p> <p>After crypto markets crashed in the last month, upcoming deals could see “prolonged and delayed negotiations”, de Lastours says. </p> <p>European investors are “taking a step back to think and negotiate”, adds de Lastours, who says they are more cautious and measured than their US counterparts, who have more dry powder and more crypto funds.</p> <p>The US raised more than twice the amount of money raised in Europe to fund blockchain companies in the first quarter, when it closed 19 mega-rounds compared with only three in Europe. “It's a more risky approach in the US . . . they are still dancing because the music hasn't stopped.” (<em>Akila Quinio</em>) </p> <h1>Fintech Fascination</h1> <p><strong>US brings first insider trading case involving NFTs</strong> A former employee of non-fungible token marketplace OpenSea has been charged with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6dfc63e-9078-4612-bda5-71224c9d6fb5\">trading on confidential information</a>, reports Hannah Murphy. Nate Chastain, OpenSea's former head of product, has been formally accused of wire fraud and money laundering, in what US prosecutors say is the first case of its kind involving digital assets.</p> <p><strong>DeFi wobbles in the wake of Luna crash </strong>Joshua Oliver, Scott Chipolina and Eva Szalay take a dive into the woes facing “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c10bc6f7-abbe-45dc-9367-042186c3336f\">decentralised finance</a>”, a favourite of cryptocurrency advocates who see it as a tool to escape intermediaries such as banks. The value of assets linked to DeFi such as Ether, the second-biggest crypto token, has taken a hit from the $40bn collapse of cryptocurrency Luna. </p> <p><strong>Rising rates spell trouble for Brazil's fintechs</strong> Disrupters in South America's largest economy are facing headwinds, writes Michael Pooler, as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5db29f5c-aaa6-49c3-8829-7c7f6d0ab743\">the age of low interest rates ends</a>. Players such as Nubank have shaken up a banking system which has left millions underserved, but customers could bear the brunt of rising costs of business.</p> <h1>Quick-fire Q&amp;A</h1> <p>I recently spoke to Marc-Alexander Christ, co-founder of SumUp which provides mobile point of sale technology. Founded in 2012, the company's products are used by around 4mn small merchants across 34 countries. Last March, it announced €750mn in funding from Goldman Sachs, Temasek, Bain Capital Credit, Crestline, and funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, bringing its financing total to around $1bn.</p> <p><strong>How have small merchants adapted to the pandemic? </strong>While it was a tough time, it also gave them an opportunity to invest in becoming more digital. That meant card payments, but also alternative ways of going to market such as online stores and things like delivery. In terms of big structural trends, we've seen a shift from cash to cards over [the] last ten years that has been helping us. While the pandemic might have helped with a bit of acceleration, merchants are becoming more digital themselves. The problem we're solving is a global one — small merchants are underserved whether they're in Chile or Manchester. There are different local requirements, but the core is the same.</p> <p><strong>How has the payment system changed in recent years? </strong>Payments is unfortunately a relatively slow industry. Think about how long it took to move from magnetic stripe to chip, and then to near-field communication (which allows for contactless payments with phones). All these developments move payments to the background because people want to focus on buying things. Educating merchants and consumers takes some time — I think where we are today with near-field communication card readers is good, but optimising further is quite challenging. We have yet to see something like a WeChat, Alipay or Venmo emerge in Europe.</p> <p><strong>How does the UK's fintech scene hold up? </strong>London has always been the capital for financial services, and it's a good city to get talent in, and to bring to talent to. Obviously Brexit doesn't necessarily help, but it's still at a very strong point. With regards to visas, if you hire quite a lot of people and have people learn how the process works, it's more of an annoying overhead. There are bigger topics to deal with.</p> <p><strong>What are your thoughts on the state of the fintech market? </strong>The shift from growth to value is a healthy development. If you look at valuations today compared to 2019, everybody is still up; it's only if you compare them to the wild times of mid-2021 that a lot of people have lost value. I think if you zoom out to a macroeconomic point of view, a lot of the fintechs create some real value in society and over say 10 years we will see a fair value emerging. Thinking about funding, I think there was too little discipline in terms of pulling the plug if a start-up didn't perform over the past decade.</p><p>Source: Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan 2022 'Europe's era of lofty fintech valuations may be coming to an end' FT.com 6 June.
