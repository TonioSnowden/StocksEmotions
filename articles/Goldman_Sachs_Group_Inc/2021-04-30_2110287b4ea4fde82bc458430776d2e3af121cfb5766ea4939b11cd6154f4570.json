  "text": "<p>AstraZeneca reinstated 2021 targets after its first-quarter earnings doubled, in spite of the drag from its non-profit Covid-19 vaccine.</p> <p>Covid jabs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01d22a56-e606-45d4-a127-86ad03761993\">generated $275m in revenue</a> for AstraZeneca. Excluding its contribution, group revenue for the quarter rose 15 per cent year on year to $7.3bn, which beat analysts' forecasts.</p> <p>For the full year AstraZeneca targeted revenue increasing by a low-teens percentage with core earnings per share rising faster, to between $4.75 and $5. The guidance implied EPS growth of 18 per cent and 24 per cent, which matched market expectations.</p> <p>Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca's chief executive, said the strong performance was despite the pandemic delaying the diagnosis and treatment of many conditions. “We delivered solid progress in the first quarter of 2021 and continued to advance our portfolio of life-changing medicines,” he said. “We expect the impact of Covid to reduce and anticipate a performance acceleration in the second half of 2021.”</p> <p>Core EPS rose 55 per cent to $1.63, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.48, though its reported tax rate of 8 per cent was much lower than anticipated thanks in part to a non-taxable gain from its sale in February of US drug developer Viela Bio. At the headline level EPS doubled to $1.19.</p> <p>Analysts said that excluding the operating loss of around $50m from the Covid jab, earnings figures were slightly disappointing as profit sharing agreements and pricing pressure in China had held back margins.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>Darktrace</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6cf0cec0-7774-428f-ae83-5bd6479ae9f6\">cyber security software maker</a>, priced its London flotation at 250p per share ahead of today's market debut to give the company a maiden value of £1.7bn. Bookrunners to the float had been marketing the stock at between 220p and 280p. Darktrace said its float had raised £143.4m with the sale of new equity with existing shareholders selling a further £21.7m before the overallotment option.</p> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> posted a record quarterly pre-tax profit of £2.4bn, up more than 160 per cent year on year and better than the consensus forecast of £1.8bn. Unlike peers the bank did not reverse charges booked to cover bad loans at the height of the pandemic but its credit impairment charge for the first quarter was just £55m, compared with a £2.1bn charge the year before. For the full year the impairment charge will be “materially below that of 2020” and Barclays said it intended to reduce provision levels if current trends persist. Cash costs including a dividend and share buyback meant the bank's capital buffer, as measured by common equity tier one ratio, was down 0.5 of a percentage point to 14.6 per cent.</p> <p><strong>Hikma Pharmaceuticals</strong> said in a trading update that 2021 “is off to a good start with performance in line with our expectations”. Injectables and branded medicines are “performing well” on the gradual return of elective surgeries and the generics business is “having a good start to the year”, meaning revenue from that division will be at the top end of previous guidance, Hikma said. </p> <p>Vets group <strong>CVS</strong> said trading has remained strong since its interim results in late March with a steady increase in customer demand from the end of the last quarter. The easing of lockdown restrictions means revenue for the full year ending June will be ahead of current management expectations and adjusted underlying earnings&#xa0;will be “comfortably” ahead, CVS said. </p> <p>Engineer <strong>Rotork</strong>&#xa0;said trading since the start of the year has matched expectations. Order intake has been only modestly below 2020 levels and commodity cost inflation has been largely offset by a January price hike, it said. </p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Amazon</strong> has reported its second straight quarter of $100bn-plus sales, comfortably beating Wall Street's targets as it continues <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2b05040-3164-46f3-8bd5-399e6214ea74\">to reap the rewards of pandemic conditions</a>. Net income more than tripled to $8.1bn, helping push Amazon shares up 3 per cent to a record above $3,590 in after-hours trading. </p> <p><strong>Twitter's</strong> user growth <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7ea5a49-2a67-4461-b4e2-96ad2f478673\">fell short of expectations</a> for the third quarter in a row, and it issued tepid revenue guidance despite benefiting from a broader surge in digital advertising spending during the pandemic. The update from the San Francisco-based social media group bucked the trend this week from Big Tech that beat forecasts and Twitter shares fell more than 10 per cent in after-hours trading.</p> <p>Quantum computing could be brought to bear on some of the most complex calculations in financial markets <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bbff5dfd-caa3-4481-a111-c79f0d38d486\">within five years</a>, according to research jointly conducted by <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>. The bank's research, conducted with quantum start-up QC Ware, looked into using quantum machines to price complex derivatives using a set of calculations that rely on so-called Monte Carlo simulations.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>John Gapper</strong> <br>Governments ruled the skies in the days of Sputnik and the Apollo missions. But in the intervening decades the balance of space power has tilted from countries to companies — and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49514bb1-fed0-4efe-8d86-b314ca66df40\">SpaceX founder Elon Musk</a> is taking the lead.</p> <p><strong>City Insider</strong> <br>Jamie Dimon raised hackles this week by delivering&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0dd2a0a9-19b5-4904-b624-d7bf613b2ef8\">a memo</a>&#xa0;some saw as patronising and prescriptive.
