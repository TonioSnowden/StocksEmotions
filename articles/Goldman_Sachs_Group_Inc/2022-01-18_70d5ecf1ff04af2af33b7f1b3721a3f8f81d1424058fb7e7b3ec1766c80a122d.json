  "text": "<p>The chief executive of Goldman Sachs has warned of “wage inflation everywhere” after a big jump in expenses hit fourth-quarter profits at the Wall Street bank. </p> <p>In an interview with the Financial Times, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83d330b3-e1fd-424c-b2d6-d79682b9b348\">David Solomon</a> said that Goldman like other large companies was contending with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e9907d0-06ea-469e-8f32-e07dcd69f1a8\">higher wage demands</a> from its employees. “There's no question that inflationary pressures around compensation had an impact,” he added.</p> <p>Solomon was speaking after Goldman on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter net income of $3.8bn, or $10.81 per share, compared with $4.36bn, or $12.08 per share, in the same period last year. </p> <p>That was a bigger drop than analysts had predicted, with the consensus forecast for net income at about $4.1bn, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p> <p>Goldman shares closed down 7 per cent at $354.40. </p> <p>Headcount at Goldman grew 8 per cent in 2021 to 43,900 while pay also jumped as the bank paid <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51c4638b-2663-4fa2-9fa3-8608d488d227\">bumper bonuses</a> to reward staff — particularly investment bankers — for record annual profits last year. </p> <p>Pay including bonuses was up 31 per cent year on year in the fourth quarter at $3.2bn, more than the $2.9bn analysts had forecast. Annual salary expenses were up 33 per cent at $17.7bn in 2021, mirroring the bank's net revenue growth for the year. </p> <p>Bank stocks were already under pressure after JPMorgan Chase <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1828f7a3-97ad-46e2-806f-97987c079b9d\">warned on Friday</a> that it would miss profitability targets this year in part owing to higher expenses. Goldman exacerbated those worries by reporting operating expenses of $7.3bn for the fourth quarter, up 23 per cent from a year earlier and more than the $6.4bn analysts had expected. </p> <p>The results “are a stark reminder that wage inflation is hitting the banking sector hard”, said Octavio Marenzi, chief executive of Opimas, a capital markets management consultancy.</p> <p>Despite earnings missing estimates in the fourth quarter, full-year net profit for 2021 came in at $21.2bn, more than double the level in 2020 and easily the largest in the bank's history. </p> <p>Revenue earned in investment banking from advising on mergers and acquisitions, initial public offerings and debt deals was up 45 per cent to $3.8bn in the fourth quarter due to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6dfdd78a-e229-4524-a400-144396524eb6\">surge in dealmaking</a> activity. JPMorgan last week reported investment banking revenue rose 28 per cent year on year to $3.2bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>It was the eighth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth for Goldman's investment bank, although analysts expected the streak to end in early 2022 following the high bar set last year.</p> <p>However, the dealmaking boom failed to make up for a weaker performance in the bank's trading division. Revenue at the unit, which had a bumper year in 2020 because of heavy trading volume during the pandemic, was down 7 per cent at $3.98bn year on year, missing analysts' forecasts of $4.3bn.</p> <p>Solomon said: “There's nothing to change our view of the [trading] business.”</p> <p>Asked about the decline in Goldman's stock price on Tuesday, Solomon said: “I like it better on days when the stock goes up . . . We're focused on executing our plan, not on short-term gyrations of the stock price.” </p> <p>The investment banking and trading divisions accounted for more than 60 per cent of Goldman's revenues. The units are still by far its biggest profit engines two years after Solomon <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f5e13448-4296-11ea-abea-0c7a29cd66fe\">outlined plans</a> to focus on newer businesses such as consumer and transaction banking.</p> <p>Solomon said he would give investors a “refresh” on the bank's targets next month.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2022 'Goldman Sachs' David Solomon warns of ‘wage inflation everywhere' as expenses jump' FT.com 18 January.
