  "text": "<p>How best to spend £9bn? According to Ivan Menezes, Diageo's long-serving chief executive, it's on Diageo shares. </p> <p>The world's biggest distiller said on Wednesday that it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4727818-83b6-4435-aa52-b66204f19355\">resuming a cash return programme</a> paused last April at the start of the pandemic. Forecast-beating profit growth in the year to date justified the resumption of share buybacks, which came about a year earlier than analysts had been forecasting. Shareholders can expect another £3.25bn returned by mid-2024 on top of the more than £5.75bn Diageo has spent on repurchases in the previous four years. </p> <p>Buybacks are in vogue on the back of a blowout first-quarter earnings season. Exceptional post-lockdown trading has combined with easy credit conditions and an uncertain outlook to favour repurchases, which are much easier than dividends to switch on and off at short notice. </p> <p>So far, Wall Street has been the pace setter — US companies spent a record-breaking $484bn on share buybacks in the first four months of 2021 according to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7adb226-e9a6-4cd8-9049-35d55c211ca4\">Goldman Sachs</a> — but European peers of all sizes are now following suit. </p> <p>Unilever's first-quarter update in April included <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18ac6662-f8e2-42be-b96f-e34281bda107\">a pledge to spend €3bn</a> on buybacks by the end of 2021. Mike Ashley's Frasers Group, which since its last trading update in December has called repeatedly for more state aid for retailers, last week pleased investors and baffled analysts by launching a £60m buyback. </p> <p>The coming wave of cash returns promises a compensation of sorts after Covid-19 gave European corporates an excuse to reset ordinary dividends. Europe's historic prioritisation of a fat and relatively reliable dividend yield often gets the blame for long-term corporate under-investment versus the US, which shows up both in relative acquisition firepower and capital expenditure as a proportion of sales. </p> <p>Can prioritising buybacks over dividends make European companies more nimble and opportunistic? It's an idea that's counter to one of the most common criticisms put forward by the type of investor who talks about repurchases as a form of stock manipulation. </p> <p>Buybacks are nothing more than a drain on cash that would otherwise stimulate economic growth, they argue. Management's job is to find investment opportunities, not to speculate on when their own shares are undervalued. </p> <p>Other common complaints include a lack of clear disclosure around new share issuance for employee bonuses, which can refill the equity bucket as quickly as it's being drained. And whereas investors are asked to believe in the hypothetical future benefit of swapping their cash for a reduced share count, directors have a much clearer incentive to artificially boost earnings-per-share metrics ahead of their stock options vesting. </p> <p>All of which brings us back to Diageo. The latest leg of its buyback comes as shares nudge towards a record high, having rallied 35 per cent from the March 2020 trough. Management will struggle to claim they look undervalued by any measures, already trading at the upper end of the long-term range at about 25 times next year's earnings. </p> <p>Yet what else can Menezes do? Diageo's acquisition targets are few and far between: more than half of the world's top 100 spirit brands are owned by it, Pernod Ricard of France and Chinese group Baijiu, according to HSBC research. </p> <p>A potential combination of Pernod Ricard and US distiller Brown-Forman looks like the sector's only remaining mega merger. By contrast, Diageo's recent spending has been organic expansion of ready-to-drink cocktails and bolt-on deals for makers of hard seltzers, a market still valued in millions rather than billions having not existed before 2015.</p> <p>And, importantly, Diageo is not funding its capital returns by forgoing investment opportunities. Mostly it's swapping equity for cheap debt on which interest payments are tax deductible. </p> <p>Diageo's biggest future costs likely relate to the possible tidying up of part-owned divisions including the Moët Hennessy joint venture and United Spirits of India. Locking in higher dividends might stymie its negotiating position, whereas there's an opportunity cost to letting balance sheet capacity go spare awaiting agreements that could never arrive. </p> <p>Menezes's cash return policy has looked pretty shrewd so far; investors owe him the benefit of the doubt. </p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Diageo's cash return plans are no reason for a stiff drink' FT.com 12 May.
