Together, they have closed acquisitions worth more than $50bn.</p> <p>The Luxembourg-based outfit has been a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/20df2e3e-ceea-47f9-997a-8c143193d4bb\">mainstay</a> in DD as it rolled up coffee, cosmetics and restaurant groups. &#xa0;</p> <p>There has been palace intrigue too. Top operating partner <strong>Bart</strong> <strong>Becht</strong> departed in 2019 after falling out with his peers. A year later, JAB was ensnared in a legal battle with Mars, where current chief executive <strong>Olivier</strong> <strong>Goudet</strong> cut his teeth before decamping to JAB.</p> <p>Reflecting on a decade of deals this past March, Goudet took stock of JAB's performance and concluded the group had fallen short of a 15 per cent return target. </p> <p>Now, Goudet is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f32bee39-0ddf-47a3-8560-67838e7c9089\">setting his sights on petcare</a>, which he hopes will drive better returns. Since 2019, JAB has spent more than $11bn on the sector.</p> <p>But the US<strong> Federal Trade Commission</strong> has challenged some of those deals as part of a broader push against private equity takeovers.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10575538.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>In June, the regulator ordered JAB to divest two vet clinics in less than a month.</p> <p>Chair <strong>Lina</strong> <strong>Khan</strong> has said the actions “allow the FTC to better address stealth roll-ups by private equity firms like [JAB] and serial acquisitions by other corporations”.</p> <p>JAB was attracted to pet care because ownership is surging, especially among millennial households that may choose to raise a Labrador instead of a child. Vet spending isn't discretionary. In the 2008 crisis, some pet owners said they'd spend on the pup instead of their prescriptions.</p> <p>“The love of pets . . . will continue to be important no matter what the economic environment is,” said <strong>David</strong> <strong>Bell</strong>, a former <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> banker who has handled big JAB deals including the $18.7bn takeover of <strong>Dr Pepper</strong>.</p> <p>Buyers now face a crowded market and the risk of overpaying. The secret is also out on JAB. When it started rolling up coffee shops in 2011, few knew about it.</p> <p>“JAB pursued the coffee strategy under the cover of night. No one knew what they were doing and no one really cared,” said someone close to the firm. “If <strong>Nestlé</strong> knew what JAB was when it got into coffee, they would have made every attempt to thwart them.”</p> <p>That is precisely the pressure JAB now faces from the FTC and its arch rival, Mars.</p> <h1>Troubled deals like Twitter have merger arbs salivating</h1> <p>It's not just <strong>Twitter</strong>. A series of big M&amp;A deals don't look so certain to close. </p> <p>In the case of the beleaguered social network, the challenge is a mercurial multi-billionaire who suddenly has cold feet over forking over $44bn. But other deals now on the rocks face various maladies. </p> <p><strong>Microsoft</strong>'s acquisition of <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> is not threatened by any shortage of cash. But the mood among competition authorities in the US and abroad isn't so favourable to trillion-dollar companies looking to build even bigger empires. </p> <p>And <strong>Frontier</strong>'s bid for rival discount carrier <strong>Spirit Airlines</strong> has an unclear path because <strong>JetBlue</strong> has come in with a knockout offer.</p> <p>These diverse factors have created a golden era for merger arbitrage funds that bet on when and if signed M&amp;A deals will close. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/1619148.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>“From a risk/reward perspective, it's a more attractive environment since there are real strategic rationales you can underwrite as an arb,” said one executive at a merger arb fund.</p> <p>DD's Sujeet Indap <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d304b10-c266-4ecd-826f-093ba030ef73\">looked at the landscape</a> and has this conclusion: up in the air are several high profile tie-ups in which discount spreads have widened out to more than a juicy 10 per cent.</p> <p>Bet right and the winnings can be substantial. Shares of <strong>Tenneco</strong>, which <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> had agreed to acquire for&#xa0; $20 per share, had recently fallen to under $15 on worries that the leveraged buyout could collapse. But this week, as financing for the deal is coming together, shares rose above $19 on the basis that it looks more likely to close. &#xa0;</p> <p>One wild card that hasn't really intruded into the arb game for years: central bank tightening. When discounting back future pay-offs, investors are now forced to use sharply higher interest rates in their models.</p> <p>Even with the fertile environment, Twitter remains the situation that the buyside cannot look away from. </p> <h1>Farewell, Bill Spackman</h1> <p>When <strong>Bill Ackman</strong> launched his special purpose acquisition company in July 2020, investors clambered to put their money into the vehicle. </p> <p><strong>Pershing Square Tontine Holdings</strong> raised $4bn — the largest Spac ever — with Ackman's hedge fund promising another $1bn to $3bn in funding. That meant PSTH had at least $5bn in the bank to get itself a deal. </p> <p>The pool of possible companies was small — the Spac acquires a stake in a private group, thereby taking it public. So PSTH was looking at targets with valuations of more than $25bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Despite talks of a big name acquisition such as <strong>Airbnb</strong>, <strong>Stripe</strong> or even <strong>Bloomberg</strong>, PSTH has come out empty-handed. </p> <p>Ackman <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60c6d73b-dda1-4ba6-8896-d5c8558f89dd\">notified shareholders</a> on Monday that he will be returning the money to investors and liquidating the Spac. He was just weeks away from a two-year deadline within which he would've had to find a deal.</p> <p>He said the quick economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic had affected his ability to find a target because the traditional route to public markets — an initial public offering — remained open and most high-quality businesses chose it. </p> <p>In many ways, it's unfortunate that Ackman's Spac didn't get to the finish line. </p> <p>He structured the vehicle in a way that would've probably kept a lot of the chancers out of the market. The billionaire investor didn't take any founder shares, an important component of the traditional Spac structure that is enormously lucrative for those launching the vehicle. </p> <p>Needless to say, no one replicated this model because it removed the perks of launching a Spac. </p> <p>Ackman also tried his hand at striking a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e819d8c9-2f0f-43f5-a652-1dd216da31f1\">novel transaction</a> by using the Spac proceeds to buy a $4bn stake in <strong>Universal Music Group</strong> at a $40bn valuation, but without taking the company public. The deal was extremely complex and didn't go down well with shareholders or regulators, who thought it looked more like a hedge fund investment than a Spac deal. </p> <p>But it isn't curtains just yet. Ackman is trying his hand at another Spac-like innovation — the Sparc. Investors in a special purpose acquisition rights company have the option, but not obligation, to participate in a deal. </p> <p>Who knows? A Sparc might just fly with investors. </p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36d5eb1d-e140-473c-8e3a-478470200a80?\">has hired</a> <strong>Jared Cohen</strong> as its president of global affairs.
