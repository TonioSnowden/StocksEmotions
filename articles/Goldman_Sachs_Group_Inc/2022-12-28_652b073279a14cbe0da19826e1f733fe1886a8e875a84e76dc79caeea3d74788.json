  "title": "Is George Santos Believable-ish? The Republican representative-elect's denials are almost as imaginative as the tales he told during the campaign.",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Santos claimed to have worked for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. They never heard of him. His defense was that he worked for firms that had partnerships with Goldman and Citi and arranged \"capital introductions\" for his clients. \"It was stated poorly,\" Mr. Santos explained. When asked about it on Fox News by former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Mr. Santos continued to insist it was all just an \"embellishment,\" which he could explain except that it would be beyond the ability of reasonable people to understand. He added, \"I'm not a fraud. I'm not a fake.\"</p><p>Mr. Santos is aggrieved that listeners think these false claims might make him unfit to serve in Congress. \"I'm not a criminal,\" he told WABC radio host John Catsimatidis.</p><p>Mr. Santos admitted that he once skipped out on paying his rent, insisting he's \"not embarrassed by it.\" He didn't have the money, he said, because he was paying for his mother's cancer treatments. Asked about making good on the debt, he replied, \"We didn't pay it off. I forgot about it.\" Forgetting about a large debt? He'll fit right in on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Communications professionals have long recognized the challenges of issuing a public denial. The listener is likely to overlook the denial and actually hear the opposite of what the speaker is trying to say. But the most damaging part of Mr. Santos's story is that national Republicans knew the details of his official biography were suspect and did nothing. Senior Republican staffers have told reporters that these falsehoods were widely known and became a running joke.</p><p>Didn't your mother tell you that you're known by the company you keep? She was right. By letting these falsehoods fester, Republicans planted themselves in the path of distrust. Who can believe anything George Santos says? What does his word mean? Do Republicans want him as the emblem of their new generation?</p><p>Mr. Santos's interview with Ms. Gabbard demonstrated the downside of the advice so many media advisers give their clients: \"Just answer the question you wish you had been asked.\" Mr. Santos seems to believe that if he keeps repeating that Democrats like Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren lied too, and that he only \"embellished\" his background and \"made a mistake,\" it will crowd out the well-documented lies. Ms. Gabbard asked him, \"Have you no shame?\" It was a rhetorical question but a fair one. And that's the real shame.</p><p>Ms. Spaeth, a Dallas communications consultant, was President Reagan's director of media relations, 1983-85.</p><p>Is George Santos Believable-ish?</p>",
