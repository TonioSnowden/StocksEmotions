  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>The world's most-indebted property developer is now offering homes at a 28 per cent discount to angry investors seeking repayments on its bonds. Offices are available at a 46 per cent discount. China's Evergrande, submerged in a debt crisis, is doing everything it can to preserve cash.</p> <p>Protests have broken out as investors in Evergrande stocks and bonds, which offered yields of as much as 13 per cent, are faced with losses. China's property sector has become a target of scrutiny as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2377dae-0d52-4f6f-92ba-099f922b966d\">regulators</a> try to cool speculation. </p> <p>Foreign investors spooked by government meddling across Chinese sectors are likely to pull more money out of the country. Still, MSCI China's multiple hovers close to the top of its 10-year range. Valuations do not invite a contrarian stance just yet, says Lex. </p> <p>Beijing is targeting new sectors faster than investors predicted. Amid increased oversight of gambling hub Macau, casino operator Wynn Resorts has received a $1.5bn credit line from Bank of China. Sales are slowing as the government starts an overhaul of gambling laws. </p> <p>Lex thinks the most worrying aspect of this is the possibility that new laws will restrict the number of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31c2a055-9425-4c54-be41-4867a2153b6e\">casino operating licences</a>. That could lead to operators going out of business. Wynn's latest loan agreement reflects those concerns, including certain mandatory prepayment provisions should Wynn Macau lose its rights to gaming operations. Share prices of casino operators Wynn Macau and SJM Holdings are down more than half this year.</p> <p>There are safer bets to be had in companies that use technology to make money in less controversial leisure pursuits. Sporting goods company Vista Outdoor is buying golf-simulator maker Foresight Sports in the hope of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d4fb36b-c524-4051-a2c0-41228c1f6b4f\">bringing new players</a> to an old game. Vista, which is paying $474m for Foresight, gains high-tech products including a $14,000 monitor that helps golfers improve their swing. The deal comes at a good time. Golf equipment sales are surging. In total, the industry pulled in more than $2.8bn in revenues last year.</p> <p>Technology is still disrupting advertising businesses, too. S4 Capital, the digital-only agency founded by Sir Martin Sorrell, is at full steam. Organic net revenues are set to grow 40 per cent this year. S4's market value of £4bn is up 12 times in the past two years. Lex thinks the shares reflect <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b314cded-92c6-489e-af71-77622506a5ec\">wider optimism about the sector</a>. </p> <p>For the financial industry, however, technology is not always a cure-all. New recruits at investment banks may be hoping that automation will cut their hours. But Lex thinks it could simply <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d3248a6-25e6-4abf-bf9d-088c16b3316c\">add to the workload</a>. Fancy software will not change investment banking's incentive structure. </p> <p>In finance, tech claims of disruption often ignore the ways in which existing infrastructure is hard to uproot. Lex points out the irony of fintechs entirely reliant on the incumbents from which they are trying to take business. Fintech platform GreenSky, for example, receives financing from funding partners such as Bank of Montreal. Goldman Sachs is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/518d690f-0049-4973-b83c-18e37b9be1d3\">acquiring GreenSky</a> for $2.2bn, which implies a greater than 50 per cent premium. But Goldman's own share price is riding high. It is a good time to make acquisitions. </p> <p>For UK law firm Keystone Law, digital first is a founding principle. The Aim-listed company gives support to self-employed lawyers working remotely. Top-line growth, averaging 21 per cent a year over the past five years, comes from recruiting more lawyers. If conventional law firms start to offer remote working as standard, Keystone may find it more difficult to add new lawyers. Shareholders must hope that in law, disruption remains a distant prospect. </p> <p>Enjoy your weekend,</p> <p><strong>June Yoon</strong><br><em>Lex writer</em></p><p>Source: June Yoon 2021 'Best of Lex: Who disrupts the disrupters?'
