  "title": "World News:  Brazil's Economy Grows as Virus Rages  ---  Soaring agricultural  exports fuel rise of  1.2% in first quarter,  even as cases surge  ----  By Jeffrey T. Lewis and Samantha Pearson",
  "text": "<p>   SAO PAULO -- Brazil's economy has returned to pre-pandemic levels, lifted by the biggest stimulus in emerging markets and a return to normal activity by many Brazilians who have ignored scientists' calls to remain in lockdown as Covid-19 rages across the country. </p><p>   In data released on Tuesday, the economy grew 1.2% from the fourth quarter, boosted by agricultural exports, taking Latin America's biggest economy back to its size at the end of 2019 before the beginning of the pandemic. Economists had forecast growth of less than 1%. </p><p>   \"People were up and about, generating GDP, but at a cost to public health, as we saw from the Covid numbers,\" said Alberto Ramos, an economist at Goldman Sachs. But much of the growth came from pent-up demand during the pandemic, he said, adding that the country is still struggling to diversify its economy away from commodities. </p><p>   \"We have to grow the hard way, which is through investment and productivity growth, and that's a challenge for Brazil,\" Mr. Ramos said. </p><p>   As Brazilians fill shopping malls and bars, about 77 people are still dying from Covid-19 every hour. More than 460,000 Brazilians have died from the disease. </p><p>   Public-health experts also blame the country's lax handling of the pandemic for creating the conditions for the emergence of the P.1 variant, which has spread to more than 30 countries and is wreaking havoc across Latin America. </p><p>   Brazil's third consecutive quarter of growth was driven by a 5.7% rise in the powerful agriculture sector from the previous three months, as well as a 4.6% rise in investments over the same period. </p><p>   Another reason Brazil's economy has bounced back so quickly is one of the world's biggest stimulus packages. The government spent the equivalent of 8.3% of its annual economic output last year in stimulus, most of it in cash handouts to residents of up to $233 a month, according to the International Monetary Fund. </p><p>   That helped ensure that the economy contracted just 4.1% last year, about half the size of the economic contraction in many of Brazil's neighbors. </p><p>   Brazil's stimulus was the biggest of any major emerging market, roughly double the percentage spent by China or India and compared with just 0.7% of GDP in Mexico, which saw its economy contract by a far larger 8.3% last year. The downside for Brazil is that the government piled on debt, which is now at 86.7% of GDP -- a level considered unsustainable for developing countries that need to borrow. </p><p>   \"The aid payments were absolutely critical. Without [them] we wouldn't be where we are today,\" said Mr. Ramos. \"But was it worth it? We enjoyed a great meal, but the bill will come next,\" he said. </p><p>   Much of Brazil eased lockdown restrictions this year, preventing bigger declines in consumer spending even as the aggressive P.1 variant swept the country and prompted a surge in new infections. </p><p>   Consumer spending declined 0.1% in the first quarter and contracted 1.7% from a year earlier, while government spending was down 0.8% from the fourth quarter and declined 4.9% from a year earlier. </p><p>   \"The impact of the pandemic last year was very big, and demand for credit collapsed. We haven't seen anything similar in the lockdowns this March and April,\" said Sergio Furio, chief executive officer of the Brazilian online lender, Creditas. \"We're very optimistic for 2021 and 2022, all the numbers we're seeing point to a recovery in credit demand.\" </p><p>   In other parts of Latin America, countries have struggled to recover after the region's economy contracted 7.5% in 2020, the worst downturn in two centuries, according to the United Nations. </p><p>   In Peru, a strict lockdown last year caused the economy to contract 11%, the second-worst contraction in South America after Venezuela. The lockdown initially resulted in the loss of about half of the jobs in Lima, Peru's government said. With no social safety net and few savings, workers in the vast informal economy couldn't comply with orders to stay home, making it impossible for the government to maintain a stringent lockdown. </p><p>   In Argentina, the economy contracted 10% in 2020, the third-biggest slide in the region, with businesses rattled by one of the world's longest lockdowns. The IMF expects Argentina's economy to grow 5.8% this year. </p><p>   While many Brazilian informal workers had no choice but to leave home to feed their families, President Jair Bolsonaro has also encouraged Brazilians to defy lockdown restrictions by state governments, telling them late last year to \"stop being a country of sissies.\" </p><p>   Political scientists said the fast economic recovery could help increase the chances of Mr. Bolsonaro's re-election next year, despite widespread criticism of his handling of the pandemic. He faces a challenge from the former leftist president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, with polls showing a tight race. </p><p>   \"This was just what Bolsonaro had been hoping for,\" said Rafael Cortez, a political scientist at Sao Paulo-based consulting firm Tendencias. \"His hope is that in 2022, when more people have been vaccinated, that public opinion will turn to the economy again and this will give him the edge.\" </p><p>   Brazil's powerful agricultural sector also shielded the economy from the worst of the pandemic. The weak currency helped, boosting farm exports from the country, the world's biggest producer of soybeans, coffee, and sugar. </p><p>   Farmers grew a record crop of soybeans in the first quarter, and good commodities prices on global markets also boosted incomes. High prices on world markets for iron ore delivered another boost for Brazil, the world's second-largest producer behind Australia. </p><p>   \"Economic activity suffered a tough blow last year, but what stayed strong was commodities,\" said Pedro Paulo Silveira, chief economist at the Nova Futura brokerage in Sao Paulo. \"And world demand will stay strong for those things, so that will help growth here for the rest of this year, too.\" </p><p>   Economists are forecasting GDP contracted in the second quarter from the first after Brazil's state and local governments began to impose tighter social distancing measures in March and April as deaths and infections from Covid-19 began to rise again. The recovery is expected to resume in the second half of the year as Brazil's vaccination programs slowly advance and activity picks up again. </p><p></p>",
