  "title": "Goldman Sachs 'devastated' after 'beloved' employee killed in NYC subway shooting; A suspect has been arrested in the unprovoked shooting of Daniel Enriquez on a Manhattan-bound Q train. Andrew Abdullah, 25, is expected to face a murder charge. His motive is 'a big mystery' NYPD said.",
  "text": "<p>\"According to witnesses, the suspect was walking back and forth in the same train car and, without provocation, pulled out a gun and fired it at the victim at close range as the train was crossing the Manhattan Bridge,\" said Corey during a press conference at the Canal Street subway station.</p><p>A suspect was arrested on Tuesday, with police saying his motive for the unprovoked attack was \"a big mystery.\" Andrew Abdullah, 25, was expected to face a murder charge in Enriquez's death.</p><p>Read more: Suspect arrested in fatal shooting on New York City subway</p><p>Police officers and emergency medical technicians tried resuscitating Enriquez once the train stopped at Canal Street, but he later died at Bellevue Hospital. No one else was hurt.</p><p>Solomon said the investment banking firm was \"devastated\" to hear the fatal shooting took one of its \"beloved\" employees.</p><p>\"Daniel Enriquez was a dedicated and beloved member of the Goldman Sachs family for nine years,\" said Solomon in a statement, as reported by outlets including Bloomberg. \"He worked diligently to support our Macro Research team in New York and epitomized our culture of collaboration and excellence. We are devastated by this senseless tragedy and our deepest sympathies are with Dan's family at this difficult time.\"</p><p>The shooter, whom police described as a \"dark-skinned male who is heavyset with a beard,\" fled the train once it pulled into Canal Street. He was described as wearing a dark-colored hooded sweatshirt, gray sweatpants and white sneakers at the time of the shooting.</p><p>Police officers stopped Abdullah about a block and a half away from the subway station. But he wasn't wearing the dark hoodie at the time, and he had a backpack that hadn't been mentioned, so officers let him leave — but took down his name. After reviewing surveillance footage later, investigators learned that the shooter removed the sweatshirt after the shooting.</p><p>The Legal Aid Society, which is representing Abdullah, asked the public not to make assumptions about the case. \"Mr. Abdullah deserves vigorous representation from his defense counsel, and that is what The Legal Aid Society will provide,\" the organization said in a statement.</p><p>This is the second shooting on the NYC subway in just six weeks, after 10 people were shot and at least 13 others injured — but none killed — on an N train in Brooklyn on April 12. It was the worst subway attack in decades. Frank R. James, 62, was later arrested on federal terrorism charges over the mass shooting following a 30-hour manhunt.</p><p>And in January, Michelle Go, 40, was pushed in front of an oncoming train and killed in another unprovoked attack. The suspect, Martial Simon, was mentally ill and homeless, and has been declared unfit to stand trial.</p><p>NYPD chief Corey said that the police department is continuing to push more officers into the subway system.</p><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul tweeted that \"everyone deserves to feel safe on our subways,\" and said her office is working with the MTA and the NYPD.</p><p>Enriquez's sister Griselda Vile told the New York Times that her brother lived in Park Slope, and was heading into Manhattan for brunch on Sunday. But he had largely avoided the train during the pandemic because he was worried about his health.</p><p>\"It's horrific, this is a horror movie,\" she said.</p><p>Goldman Sachs 'devastated' after 'beloved' employee killed in NYC subway shooting</p>",
