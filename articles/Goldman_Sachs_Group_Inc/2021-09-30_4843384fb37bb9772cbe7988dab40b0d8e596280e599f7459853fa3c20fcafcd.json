  "title": "UK economic bounceback stronger than previously thought",
  "text": "<p>The <strong>UK economy</strong> bounced back more strongly than previously thought in the second quarter of this year as British consumers rushed to splash the cash they'd stashed during lockdown. UK gross domestic product increased by 5.5 per cent between April and June rather than the 4.8 per cent estimated in August. </p> <p>Household consumption accounted for 4 percentage points of the rise, after Covid-19 restrictions started to lift in April. While household spending rose by 8.9 per cent, the household savings ratio fell from 18.4 per cent in the first quarter — the second highest on record — to 11.7 per cent in the second.</p> <p>Despite the boom, the economy is still smaller than it was at the end of 2019. But the gap is now only 3.3 per cent, rather than the 4.4 per cent previously estimated. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Bad news if you're a <strong>London homeowner</strong>: the capital was the region with the slowest price growth in the three months to September, according to data from Nationwide. Prices in the capital rose 4.2 per cent year-on-year, down from 7.3 per cent in the previous quarter. Nationally, annual <strong>house price growth</strong> eased from 11 per cent in August to 10 per cent in September.</p> <p>Genomics group <strong>Oxford Nanopore</strong> has priced its IPO, putting it on course for a £3.4bn market capitalisation when conditional dealings in its shares start this morning. </p> <p>Fast-fashion retailer <strong>Boohoo</strong> has half-year results out. While revenues were up by a fifth on the same period last year to £976m, pre-tax profits fell by almost two-thirds to just £25m. The retailer said growth had picked up further in September, but that higher freight costs and wages in its distribution centres meant that adjusted ebitda margins would be lower than it previously thought. </p> <p><strong>Deliveroo</strong> is launching a rapid grocery delivery service with Wm Morrisons, putting it in competition with the likes of <strong>Getir</strong>, <strong>Gorillas</strong> and <strong>Zapp</strong>. Deliveroo already delivers from 4,600 supermarkets and convenience stores. But it will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c9dc06c-a14a-47c5-a67c-e58b8f055455\">now open its own “dark store”</a> service in South-West London in partnership with the supermarket chain under the name Deliveroo Hop. </p> <p>In other news out overnight, ministers are planning to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54b437ad-4683-434e-89aa-e26772092b31\">switch green surcharges</a> from <strong>electric to gas bills</strong> to encourage consumers to switch to lower-carbon alternatives, <strong>Deloitte</strong> has confirmed a surge in UK profits helped by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d00f5495-c664-41fc-ab50-ab40a1c74b89\">public sector pandemic contracts</a> and the <strong>Met Office</strong> is using <strong>DeepMind's</strong> AI tech to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/602235aa-7039-472a-80cf-55fa3519ea06\">forecast the weather better</a>. </p> <p>And finally it is farewell to the <strong>furlough scheme</strong>, which ends today. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission has accused a former <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> compliance analyst of making more than $471,000 from trades using confidential information he gleaned from his role at the bank, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0b5b99a-0531-48d5-85d8-f18d0510f69a\">our correspondents report</a>. US pet retailer Petco Health and Wellness, US-headquartered Norwegian Cruise Line and the UK company GW Pharmaceuticals were among the companies linked to the trades. The employee in Goldman's Warsaw office has since resigned. </p> <p>The glasses maker <strong>Warby Parker</strong> gained a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f820990-35a6-4b4a-b0ff-9e2f9e189c9d\">$6bn valuation</a> in a direct listing in New York yesterday, more than double that achieved during a recent private fundraising round. </p> <p>Paris-based satellite operator <strong>Eutelsat</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f928a4af-6e45-4536-8802-64fe7a27c55a\">turned down</a> an unsolicited takeover offer from French telecoms billionaire <strong>Patrick Drahi</strong>. Drahi offered to pay roughly €12 per share for Eutelsat, according to a person familiar with the matter, compared with a €10.35 closing price in Paris yesterday. Analysts have anticipated a period of consolidation in the satellite sector. But there are few synergies between Eutelsat and Drahi's telecoms and cable assets. </p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>Columnist and Alphavillain <strong>Jemima Kelly</strong> is finally coming back to the office. She's nervous about trying to concentrate in a bustling newsroom, having to look tidy, and the messy business of dealing with other human beings. But as she explains <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8405b3cf-2eb5-4255-8dfa-8729eab85f07\">in this touching column</a>, what she fears most is losing the sense of wellbeing she's often felt during these months of isolation.</p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'UK economic bounceback stronger than previously thought' FT.com 30 September.
