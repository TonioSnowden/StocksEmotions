If Black were to come back as soon as tomorrow, the $455bn investment group he founded 30 years ago would already have changed beyond recognition.</p> <p>That is because Rowan wasted no time in reinventing Apollo as a weighty financial institution that functions less like a Wall Street investment partnership than a diversified national bank, as DD's Mark Vandevelde and Sujeet Indap explain in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b1a1c63-5920-4876-829f-e3f1552a3903\">this deep-dive</a>.</p> <p>By merging Apollo with <strong>Athene Holding</strong>, the insurance company that he helped to create a decade ago, Rowan is turning a nimble asset manager into a lumbering insurance company that itself carries more than $200bn in assets.</p> <p>It underscores how Apollo has transformed itself from a scrappy buyout shop into a linchpin of the US financial system.</p> <p>But it's a risky move, which left some investors puzzled about why Apollo's billionaire founders had decided to put so much more of their own wealth on the line.</p> <p>Speaking of Apollo, Sujeet has just published a book on the bankruptcy fight of the famous casino <strong>Caesars</strong> from a half decade ago,<em> The Caesars Palace Coup</em>.</p> <p>The $27bn 2008 Caesars buyout, led by Apollo's Rowan and <strong>David Sambur</strong>, eventually degenerated into a free-for-all featuring the likes of <strong>GSO Capital Partners</strong>, <strong>Elliott</strong>, <strong>Oaktree</strong> and <strong>Appaloosa</strong> along with a who's who of Wall Street bankers and lawyers.&#xa0;</p> <p>Come for the juicy stories of corporate treachery, but stay for the intricate details of how the Masters of the Universe play a complex chess match to make fortunes in troubled companies.&#xa0;</p> <p>Order the book Sujeet co-wrote with Max Frumes on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Caesars-Palace-Coup-Billionaire-Corruption/dp/163576677X\">Amazon</a> or <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/the-caesars-palace-coup-how-a-billionaire-brawl-over-the-famous-casino-exposed-the-power-and-greed-of-wall-street/9781635766776\">Bookshop.org</a>, or many <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=The+Caesars+Palace+Coup+buy&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03XkjGBEGhe4lenQs4wqcY8gkS9vA%3A1616454510958&amp;ei=biNZYL_rOayy5NoPxYyDuAU&amp;oq=The+Caesars+Palace+Coup+buy&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQghEKABMgUIIRCgAToLCAAQsQMQgwEQsAM6BwgjEK4CECc6CAghEBYQHRAeUNBnWOlrYPptaAFwAHgBgAGXAogBxwaSAQUwLjQuMZgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrIAQHAAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_2q6ngsXvAhUsGVkFHUXGAFcQ4dUDCA0&amp;uact=5\">other online booksellers</a> and enjoy <a href=\"https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1r08390k0ns0k/Apollo-Caesars-and-Wall-Street-s-Billionaire-Brawl-for-Control-of-a-Gaming-Empire\">this excerpt</a> from Institutional Investor while you wait.</p> <h2>Canadian Pacific strikes biggest deal of 2021</h2> <p>Two rail operators <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d4c383a-b3ee-415d-beaf-3cc7a6dc5993\">inked the largest takeover deal</a> of the year this weekend.&#xa0;</p> <p>But to understand <strong>Canadian Pacific Railway</strong>'s purchase of US operator <strong>Kansas City Southern</strong> for $28.9bn, we need to go back 10 years in time.</p> <p>One late summer afternoon in 2011, railroad turnround legend <strong>Hunter Harrison </strong>and <strong>Bill Ackman</strong> lunched at Manhattan's <strong>Museum of Modern Art</strong>.</p> <p>The activist investor behind <strong>Pershing Square</strong> was hatching a boardroom coup at CP, and he wanted Harrison to be its new chief executive. “Bill, you can't afford me,” Harrison said, half-jokingly, according to <a href=\"https://financialpost.com/feature/how-bill-ackman-convinced-hunter-harrison-to-ride-the-rails-again\">his biography</a>. He could, as it so happened.</p> <p>Under Ackman's new regime, the Canadian operator unsuccessfully <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/efb39cd6-ffe3-11e5-ac98-3c15a1aa2e62\">approached</a> US rival <strong>CSX</strong>, and then <strong>Norfolk Southern</strong>, about potential mergers in 2014 and 2016. Both targets insisted that the <strong>Surface Transportation Board</strong>, the US regulator, was so unlikely to approve a deal that it wasn't worth considering.</p> <p>Harrison unexpectedly resigned and hopped aboard CSX <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8fa0b06-02cb-11e7-ace0-1ce02ef0def9\">in 2017</a>, a move orchestrated by activist fund <strong>Mantle Ridge</strong>. He <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2fdad16-e348-11e7-8b99-0191e45377ec\">died</a> less than a year later at the age of 73.</p> <p>But the tenacious railway turnround artist, who at one shareholder meeting declared himself fit to run the company while hooked up to a portable oxygen machine, might've appreciated that CP has finally struck a deal after multiple failed M&amp;A attempts.</p> <p>News of the potential deal comes just months after Kansas City Southern rejected a takeover bid last September from a <strong>Blackstone</strong> and <strong>Global Infrastructure Partners</strong>-led consortium that valued its shares at $21bn.</p> <p>If successful, the tie-up will connect railways between Canada, the US, and Mexico for the first time, emboldened by what the two parties hope to be a booming post-pandemic US economy and a new free trade agreement between the three countries.</p> <p>But US regulators have stood in CP's way before, reluctant to let the country's seven “Class I” rail operators diminish in number.</p> <p>Seeing that Kansas City Southern is the smallest of the lot, the acquirer may argue that the combination will be less of an antitrust headache, and create jobs in the process.</p> <h2>Four homes, a jet, a helicopter and an estate: inside Sanjeev Gupta's world</h2> <p>The market for £42m houses in London's Belgravia is small — or “very rarefied”, as local estate agents say.&#xa0;</p> <p>For the metals magnate <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong>, however, snapping up one such home (where neighbours include Russian oligarch <strong>Oleg Deripaska</strong> and Ukrainian oligarch <strong>Gennadiy Bogolyubov</strong>) was a matter of adding another multimillion-pound property to a collection.</p> <p>Gupta also owns a £19.5m property in Sydney, a £3m estate in Wales, a villa on Dubai's man-made <strong>Palm Jumeirah</strong> and the <strong>Jahama Highland Estates</strong> in Scotland.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Sanjeev plants flagpoles in the ground by buying a home wherever he sets up a new business,” a family friend <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d5956d2-33e0-4ab0-a6d9-76cf63929bd9\">told the FT</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Other accoutrements include a private jet, a helicopter and an extensive collection of Scotch whisky — and Gupta is known to have entertained friends in Sydney on a 31-metre yacht.&#xa0;</p> <p>Catch up <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d5956d2-33e0-4ab0-a6d9-76cf63929bd9\">here</a> on the story of the remarkable wealth Gupta has amassed as he has built a global industrial empire using opaque financing and generous government support.</p> <p>He bought the six-storey London townhouse the month after his ailing steel empire received hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayer-backed loans in the UK to help it through the coronavirus pandemic.&#xa0;</p> <p>Gupta's empire now faces a potentially bigger crisis, the collapse of <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>, which it relied on heavily for financing.&#xa0;</p> <p>Reminder: Greensill had funded Gupta's empire based on invoices from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1ce1ab2-46d0-4005-a633-b38a4ee16aac\">ostensibly independent companies</a> that were actually linked to the steel magnate.&#xa0;</p> <p>The now-insolvent Greensill had $5bn of exposure to Gupta's businesses — a number that Germany's financial regulator had been pushing it to reduce.&#xa0;</p> <p>Other developments in the Greensill story:&#xa0;</p> <ul>  <li><p>Investors in <strong>Credit Suisse </strong>funds linked to Greensill have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3581b726-b242-4bf9-b582-f198323ee088\">enlisted law firms</a> in preparation to sue the lender;&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Credit Suisse is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3da3d908-d7a0-4b92-847c-ebe2468aa656\">pointing the finger</a> at <strong>Marsh &amp; McLennan</strong>, the world's largest insurance broker, in its internal review;&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Conservative MPs have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84ca5ada-f916-47f0-b386-fd4d5790a0d1\">thwarted calls for an investigation</a> into the collapse of Greensill, which could have left the former UK prime minister <strong>David Cameron</strong> facing difficult questions about his role as an adviser to the group.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Mark Branson</strong>, the head of the Swiss finance watchdog <strong>Finma</strong>, is set to become president of <strong>BaFin </strong>as the German regulator looks to new leadership to restore its reputation after the <strong>Wirecard</strong> fraud scandal.
