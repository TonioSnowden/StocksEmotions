The central bank said it would start reducing purchases by $15 billion per month, after what it called substantial further progress on inflation and labor market goals.</p><p>See:Some puzzles left behind after Fed Chair Powell's press conference</p><p>“Broadly our view on interest rate policy is that the Fed will remain patient, leaving nine months between the end of QE and any increase in rates, with our expectation of the first hike being Q1 2023. However, we would acknowledge that the risks are skewed to an earlier move,” said Ryan Djajasaputra, an economist in London for Investec.</p><p>Interest rates appeared to be the biggest issue for the Dow as the bond market created a big enough reaction in a small corner of the index to bring the whole thing tumbling down.</p><p>“Weakness in financials after the 10 year yield backed up today is what hurt the Dow,” said Tom Hearden, Senior Trader at Skylands Capital.</p><p>Hearden pointed to down days from Goldman Sachs GS, JPMorgan Chase JPM, and Travelers Companies Inc.

The Labor Department on Thursday said jobless benefit claims dropped by 14,000 to 269,000 in the seven days ended Oct. 30, a new pandemic low.</p><p>It may take some big surprises, however, for jobs reports to move the needle on Fed expectations, said Matt Weller, global head of research at Forex.com and City Index, in a note.</p><p>“The next several jobs reports are unlikely to influence monetary policy meaningfully unless they're dramatically better or worse than expected for a sustained period,” he wrote. “That said, there may still be implications for fiscal policy as a major stimulus program winds its way through Congress as fears of inflation rise for the first time in decades.”</p><p>Unit-labor costs jumped 8.3% in the period from July through September, the government said Thursday. The rising costs as productivity plunged, with companies struggling to secure enough supplies on time to keep production going at full tilt.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Bank of England defied expectations for a rate increase, standing pat in its Thursday meeting.</p><p>Which companies were in focus?</p><p>Shares of Qualcomm Inc.QCOM jumped 12.7% after the mobile-chip maker reported profit and sales late Wednesday that jumped to records and predicted more growth to come.</p><p>Moderna Inc.MRNA shares dropped 18% after the company missed on sales of its COVID-19 vaccine in the third quarter of this year.</p><p>Shares of ViacomCBSVIAC gave back early gains after the media and entertainment company reported third-quarter profit that matched expectations and revenue that beat, amid strength in its streaming and TV entertainment businesses. The stock closed down 4.4%.</p><p>Roku Inc.ROKU reported strong profit growth for the third quarter late Wednesday but shares of the connected-television company fell 7.7% after the company forecast a weaker-than-expected holiday quarter due to the impacts of supply-chain disruptions.</p><p>Shares of MGM Resorts International Inc.MGM fell 2.7% after the casino operator reported a surprise third-quarter profit and said it would sell its operations of The Mirage.</p><p>Nvidia Corp.
