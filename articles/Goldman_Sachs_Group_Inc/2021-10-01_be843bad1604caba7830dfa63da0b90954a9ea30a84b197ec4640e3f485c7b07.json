  "text": "<p>\"We are pausing our advertising while Ozy Media addresses their current business challenges,\" Ford said.</p><p>The frozen ad campaigns are the latest wrinkle of the rapidly unfolding turmoil at the company kicked off on Sunday when the New York Times reported that Ozy Chief Operating Officer Samir Rao had impersonated an executive from Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube on a February fundraising call with Goldman Sachs.</p><p>Ozy Chief Executive Carlos Watson said Sunday that Mr. Rao's behavior on the call stemmed from mental-health issues, adding that Goldman Sachs wasn't affected by the incident because it didn't invest in Ozy.</p><p>The tumult at Ozy is also affecting its programming. Katty Kay, a high-profile Ozy recruit who was a correspondent and anchor for the BBC, said on Twitter Wednesday that she had resigned from Ozy this week.</p><p>On Thursday, Marc Lasry, an investor in Ozy, said he was stepping down from Ozy's board, citing a lack of relevant experience.</p>",
