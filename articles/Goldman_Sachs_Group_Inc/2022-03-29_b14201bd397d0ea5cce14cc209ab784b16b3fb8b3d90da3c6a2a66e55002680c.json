  "text": "<p>Tesla Inc. is suspending production at its car plant in Shanghai for four days, people familiar with the matter said, but chip maker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., which has two fabrication plants in the city, is producing and operating as usual, a company representative said Monday. Shanghai's port remains open, but exporters are bracing for delays as the lockdowns hit warehouses, transport and staffing, a pattern experienced during similar targeted lockdowns such as the one in the southern city of Shenzhen.</p><p>Though China is getting better at keeping ports open and factories humming when restrictions tighten in response to rising caseloads, economists and company executives say the repeated flare-ups and logistical headaches of navigating shifting public-health measures are nonetheless weighing on industry, keeping up inflationary pressure on a world economy struggling with surging prices.</p><p>\"China is getting better at managing the shocks, but the shocks are getting bigger,\" said Hui Shan, chief China economist at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.</p><p>A surge in coronavirus cases this month prompted Chinese authorities to impose lockdowns and factory closures in chunks of the country, including manufacturing hubs such as Shenzhen and the city of Changchun in the northern province of Jilin.</p><p>Shanghai ordered citizens on the eastern side of the city to stay home on Monday and shut down public transportation for four days while public-health officials conduct a testing blitz. The lockdown is due to switch to the Western half of the metropolis of about 25 million on April 1.</p><p>For now, the city's port remains open around the clock as usual, operator Shanghai International Port Group said. Essential workers and service providers such as medical staff, police and food delivery workers will still be allowed to move about provided they show a work pass.</p><p>Companies and factories will be allowed to maintain operations under \"closed-loop production,\" municipal authorities said, a system that involves staff working, living and staying within the factory campus.</p><p>But even with such measures, keeping the flow of goods moving from factory to port to customers overseas is tricky as the lockdown ensnares truckers, warehouses and other critical links in supply chains.</p><p>\"Warehouses have shut down and transportation to and from the port has been disrupted,\" Zou Xiaodong, vice general manager at Shanghai Gangxian International Freight Forwarding Co., said Monday.</p><p>Some drivers are avoiding transporting goods through Shanghai altogether, fearful of ending up in quarantine.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
