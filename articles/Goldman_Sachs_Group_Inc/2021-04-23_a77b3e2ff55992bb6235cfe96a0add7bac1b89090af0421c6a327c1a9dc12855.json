  "text": "<p>Funds that hold inflation-protected bonds are enjoying their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59bb5713-fb16-4344-8f7f-348616bfd36b\">longest streak of inflows </a>in more than a decade, as investors gird themselves for an increase in consumer prices as the US economy recovers.</p> <p>Another $1.2bn flowed into funds that buy US Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or Tips, in the week ended Wednesday, according to data provider EPFR — the 29th consecutive week of net inflows. That took the total for the year to date to $14.4bn.</p> <p>Thecurrent run of inflows is the longest such stretch since the aftermath of the global financial crisis, when Tips funds recorded uninterrupted growth from December 2008 to early 2010.</p> <p>“Inflation is the number one concern,” said Collin Martin, a fixed-income strategist at Charles Schwab. “[Tips] are not going to give you great yield or return potential, but if you are worried about a significant upside surprise in inflation, there is really no better investment out there that can act as a hedge.”</p> <p>Markets have focused intently on the prospects for inflation since the first signs in November that the global coronavirus vaccination campaign would progress more quickly than anticipated.</p> <p>The Biden administration's $1.9tn fiscal stimulus programme, passed in March, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ed793d2-fb65-4ec7-9b4c-5851b2c780f3\">further fuelled predictions </a>of higher prices to come, with noted economists including former Treasury secretary Larry Summers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/380ea811-e927-4fe1-aa5b-d213816e9073\">warning</a> about the risks of the world's largest economy overheating.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve's favourite inflation gauge — Core PCE — was 1.4 per cent in February and policymakers have committed to keep monetary policy ultra-accommodative until it averages 2 per cent.</p> <p>Fed chair Jay Powell and other central bank officials have argued any increase in price pressure will be “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71555079-e8be-4090-b3a1-53f9a7684ec6\">transitory</a>” and likely to fade as supply chains adjust to surging demand.&#xa0;</p> <p>Popular market measures of inflation expectations indicate Wall Street broadly subscribes to that view. Two-year and five-year break-even rates, which are derived from Tips and predict inflation in two and five years, now hover at 2.63 per cent and 2.57 per cent, respectively, having both been below 2 per cent in December. The 10-year gauge is lower, however, at 2.3 per cent.</p> <p>As break-even rates have risen, longer-dated Treasuries have sold off, since those bonds' value is eroded by inflation. That sent the 10-year Treasury yield up from below 1 per cent at the start of the year to a peak of 1.78 per cent. It now sits at 1.55 per cent. </p> <p>Investment strategists expect strong economic growth and inflation to push it even higher: forecasts compiled by Bloomberg point to a year-end yield of 2 per cent.</p> <p>“Transitory [inflation] can move markets,” said Alexandra Lawson, a fixed income portfolio manager at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.&#xa0;“That in itself can lead to higher inflation expectations.”</p> <p>She added: “If you believe that inflation expectations lead to more permanent inflation, you can help offset that in Tips exposure.” </p><p>Source: Colby Smith in New York 2021 'Investors plough money into US inflation-protected bond funds' FT.com 23 April.
