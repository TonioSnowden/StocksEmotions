  "text": "<p><strong>National Express</strong> is in talks to buy smaller rival <strong>Stagecoach</strong> in an all-share deal that would combine two of Britain's leading bus operators.</p> <p>Stagecoach said its shareholders would receive 0.36 new National Express shares for each Stagecoach share they own, giving them about 25 per cent of the combined company. The read-through value would represent a 23.2 per cent premium on Stagecoach's three month average share price, valuing the Perth-based group at about £442m.</p> <p>The boards of both companies said a deal would be a “strategically compelling proposition with the potential to realise significant growth and cost synergies” such as continuing to expand in the US, combining their routes and cutting the number of depots.</p> <p>Stagecoach founders Sir Brian Souter and Dame Ann Gloag said in April that they would reduce their shareholding over the next decade, which many saw as paving the way for a takeover. Merging with National Express could create a “best of both” operator combining its private hire coach and corporate shuttle business with Stagecoach's local network, the companies said.</p> <p>“Although the deal looks financially attractive (double-digit earnings accretion) and enables National Express to de-lever quicker, we think investors will have questions around competition approval, future regional bus growth and the coach opportunity rationale,” said Jefferies analysts.</p> <p>According to Jefferies, Stagecoach has a 26 per cent share of UK regional bus routes compared with National Express's 7 per cent share. Stagecoach's Megabus long-distance coach operations have a 6 per cent market share versus National Express with 60 per cent. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Catering group <strong>Compass</strong> said current quarter revenue will be slightly ahead of previous guidance on the reopening of sports events and strong spending per head. Compass said that for the fourth quarter ending September its revenue will be 86 per cent of 2019 levels, above its target range of 80 to 85 per cent, and the underlying operating margin will be at the midpoint of the 5.5 to 6.0 per cent guidance range.</p> <p><strong>Kingfisher</strong> raised full-year targets after reporting a good start to the second half of its fiscal year ending January. The B&amp;Q owner reported half-year adjusted pre-tax profit up 61.6 per cent to £669m on sales up 19.9 per cent to £7.1bn. For the second half Kingfisher targeted an adjusted pre-tax profit in the range of £910m to £950m and like-for-like sales lower year on year by between 7 and 3 per cent, down from 15 to 5 per cent previously.</p> <p>Builders' merchant <strong>Travis Perkins</strong> outlined a cash return to shareholders following the recent sale of its plumbing and heating distribution division for £325m. The company will pay out £79m via a special dividend and put an initial £100m into a share buyback fund.</p> <p><strong>SIG</strong> said full-year profit will be ahead of prior expectations, with solid trading in July and August offsetting the impact of material shortages and cost price inflation. The insulation and roofing supplier posted a half year underlying pre-tax profit of £3m, from a £53.8m loss the previous year, on revenue up 32.1 per cent to £1.1bn.</p> <p><strong>Alphawave IP</strong>, the communications chip designer, raised full-year guidance with its maiden results as a listed company. An acceleration of contract wins meant 2021 bookings will exceed $230m, with revenue up more than 125 pear cent to $75m, Alphawave said. At IPO in May it had targeted 100 per cent year-on-year sales growth. For the first half Alphawave reported a $2.7m pre-tax profit, down 36 per cent year on year in part on flotation expenses, with revenue up 140 per cent to $27.6m</p> <p>Funeral director <strong>Dignity</strong> posted a £50.5m first half pre-tax profit, up from a £12.1m loss the year before.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs set a price range on the flotation of <strong>Petershill Partners</strong>, its alternative asset management unit, at between 320p and 380p per share, implying a market value of £3.7bn to £4.3bn. </p> <p><strong>AstraZeneca</strong> revealed plans to invest $360m to develop a manufacturing facility in Ireland to make primary ingredients for medicines.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>A liquidity crisis at Chinese property developer Evergrande shook <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/952923b7-f421-407e-b14a-ad2ff190a134\">Asia, Europe and US markets</a>. <strong>The S&amp;P 500</strong> fell 1.7 per cent, marking its worst trading day since May.
