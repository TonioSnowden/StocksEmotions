  "title": "Stocks Rebound as Oil Prices Fall",
  "text": "<p>The rebound continued in Asia early Thursday. Japan's Nikkei was up 3.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 2.2% and South Korea's Kospi was up 2.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures were flat.</p><p>The war in Ukraine has fueled big moves in stocks, commodities, currencies and bonds.</p><p>\"The market sentiment and the daily movement, and even the intraday movement, certainly has been whipsawed by the headlines surrounding the conflict in Ukraine,\" said David Sekera, Morningstar's chief U.S. market strategist.</p><p>The turbulence has sent stock indexes spiraling, erasing much of the gains of the past year. The Dow and Nasdaq -- which has entered a bear market, falling more than 20% from November's peak -- closed Tuesday at levels last seen roughly a year ago.</p><p>But analysts said Wednesday's rally could be markets taking a pause.</p><p>\"People have to be very cautious here in chasing this dip, especially as these economic impacts and fears start affecting our economy as well through consumer confidence,\" said Jerry Braakman, president and chief investment officer of First American Trust.</p><p>Brent-crude futures, the international benchmark, fell $16.84, or 13% to $111.14 a barrel, the largest one-day percentage decline since April 2020. The U.S. has banned Russian oil and gas imports, while Russian President Vladimir Putin has banned exports of unspecified commodities and raw materials.</p><p>A surge in oil prices, given new momentum by the U.S. embargo on Russian energy, has raised concerns that sustained inflation and lower economic growth could collide, which could lead to a 1970s stagflationary era.</p><p>Major central banks were on track to begin tightening monetary policy before Russia invaded Ukraine. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that he planned to propose a quarter percentage-point rate increase at the central bank's meeting this month. Consumer-price index data released on Thursday morning will provide clues to investors about the pace of inflation.</p><p>The jump in equity markets spurred investors to pull back from haven assets Wednesday. The WSJ Dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of others, lost 0.74 point, or 0.8% to 90.83. That pullback comes after a winning streak that pushed the greenback to its highest level in nearly two years. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes edged up for a third consecutive trading day to 1.946%, the largest three-day yield gain since June 2020. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Gold prices, another asset that investors perceive as safe, lost $54.20, or 2.7%, to $1,985.90 a troy ounce, the largest one-day dollar and percentage decline since June 2021. Trading in the nickel market was suspended for another day, following violent moves Tuesday that sent the metal surging to briefly top the $100,000-a-ton mark for the first time.</p><p>In New York trading, travel and textile stocks rallied. Cruise lines Carnival added $1.39, or 8.8%, to $17.27 and Royal Caribbean advanced $3.52, or 5.5%, to $68.06. American Airlines Group gained 79 cents, or 5.9%, to $14.30, and United Airlines Holdings rallied $2.665, or 8.3%, to $34.90. Tapestry Inc. gained $3.45, or 11%, to $35.88, its largest percentage increase April 2020.</p><p>Meanwhile, Amazon.com's shares surged 8.2% in after-hours trading after the e-commerce company said it would enact a 20-for-1 stock split stock and buy back as much as $10 billion of its shares.</p><p>Goldman Sachs on Monday raised its 2022 estimates for share buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 to $1 trillion. Jessica Bemer, portfolio manager at Easterly Investment Partners, said companies' strong balance sheets are comforting investors. .</p><p>\"We know that the market is essentially operating in quicksand. We're not sure if today is the low or tomorrow is the low, but we do know that these companies will continue to exist and survive,\" she said.</p><p>Energy shares, which have outperformed this year, declined. Halliburton fell $1.92, or 5.2%, to $34.84 and Marathon Oil lost 69 cents, or 2.9%, to $23.40.</p><p>In the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin mounted a comeback after its recent slide, rising 8.5% from its 5 p.m. New York closing price to trade around $41,809. On Wednesday, President Biden signed an executive order instructing agencies across the federal government to consider the creation of a U.S. digital currency.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 jumped 4.7%. Germany's blue-chip index DAX ended up 7.9%. That marks its best day since March 2020 and one that helped launch it out of bear-market territory.</p><p>Russia's stock market remained closed, though its currency traded. In the offshore market, the ruble edged slightly lower in volatile trading to around 128 rubles to the dollar. Pricing of Russia's currency has been choppy since the country imposed measures to stem its selloff, and Western banks have shunned Russian assets.</p><p>---</p><p>Joe Wallace and Stephanie Lai contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
