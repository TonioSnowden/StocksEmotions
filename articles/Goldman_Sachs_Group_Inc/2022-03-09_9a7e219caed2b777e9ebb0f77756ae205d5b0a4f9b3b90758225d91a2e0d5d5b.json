  "text": "<p>   Real-estate developer Hines started investing in Russia soon after the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. Before long, the U.S. company became one of the world's largest foreign owners and managers of Russian commercial property. </p><p>   Hines thought a reborn Russia would embrace market reforms and become more integrated with Western Europe. The Houston developer rode out ruble devaluations, financial crises and the sanctions that followed Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea to chalk up positive returns. </p><p>   Now, Hines's bet on Russia has taken on new perils because of the country's invasion of Ukraine. </p><p>   Hines said it valued its portfolio of owned and managed Russian malls, office buildings, rental apartments and other assets at $2.9 billion before the war. Today, it faces steep losses from the West's sanctions that will erode Russian spending power and demand for commercial space. </p><p>   The company's assets in Russia represent about 1.8% of Hines's $160 billion of assets under management and rank ninth among its foreign holdings. But some analysts warn that the Hines brand could suffer from association with a country viewed as a pariah. </p><p>   \"The question now is reputation risk,\" said Cedrik Lachance, head of research for real-estate analytics firm Green Street. </p><p>   Hines publicly condemned the invasion, and the firm said it won't make new investments in Russia. \"We do, however, have commitments made to our investors, partners, tenants and lenders and we are in discussions with them to determine the best path forward,\" Hines said. </p><p>   The war in Ukraine underscores the difficulty in assessing political risk, even for companies like Hines that pride themselves on risk management and positive returns in volatile markets. </p><p>   Executives said the decision to stay in Russia over the years reflected a belief that the country's rich energy resources, educated workforce and growing middle class compensated for the risks. Hines relied on its history of emerging-markets investments, which they say has mostly paid off despite some unnerving moments. </p><p>   \"We've always known that geopolitical shifts could present challenges and have navigated those successfully,\" said Jeff Hines, who shares the title of chief executive with his daughter Laura Hines-Pierce. </p><p>   Even before the war, most foreigner investors soured on Russian real estate. Real-estate professionals surveyed by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Land Institute ranked Moscow last among 31 European cities for expected price and rent growth in 2022. \"There are no buyers for the product,\" said one unnamed adviser cited in the report. </p><p>   Foreigners accounted for 2.2% of investment in the Russian commercial real-estate market during the first three quarters of 2021, according to a report from property brokerage and consulting firm Knight Frank. That was down from 9% in 2020 and the lowest level since at least 2009. </p><p>   Hines isn't the only foreign investor to be active in post-Soviet Russia. A fund managed by Morgan Stanley Real Estate Investing bought the Galeria mall in St. Petersburg for $1.1 billion in 2012 and owns a 39% stake in the property, according to a person familiar with the matter. A year later, it bought the Metropolis mall in Moscow for $1.2 billion and now owns a 50% stake. </p><p>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. purchased a St. Petersburg shopping mall with a Russian partner, while Raven Property Group Ltd. owns warehouse complexes in Russia. The company's London-listed shares have lost close to half their value since Russia invaded Ukraine this year. A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment on the transaction. </p><p>   Raven said: \"The ability of the Company to continue to access the funds of its Russian subsidiaries and whether those funds can be converted to the correct currency at a commercial exchange rate is the greatest uncertainty at this time.\" </p><p>   Hines, which has 250 employees in Russia, has stood out for the size of its operation. Hines's first project in Russia was an apartment and office building known as Park Place Moscow, which opened in the early 1990s. </p><p>   Hines said that during its three decades in Russia, the company never invested with state-owned enterprises and \"has operated a scrupulous business based on the utmost of integrity.\" </p><p></p>",
