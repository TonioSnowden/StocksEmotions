  "text": "<p>The company said it would purchase its stock through an accelerated share repurchase program with Goldman Sachs. Victoria's Secret will receive 4.1 million shares on Dec. 31, and the company said the program would close by the end of the first quarter of 2022.</p><p>Victoria's Secret has been working to turn around its image, relying less on supermodels in ads and including more models with diverse body shapes. The company has also made other changes, bringing back its swimwear business and selling maternity bras and shapewear.</p><p>In August, the company was spun off from L Brands and started trading as a stand-alone company.</p><p>Victoria's Secret Chief Executive Officer Martin Waters said Wednesday the company had strong sales growth during the Thanksgiving shopping weekend and a \"rush of business\" as it got closer to Christmas. The company, which has around 1,400 stores world-wide, stuck with its previous estimate that sales in its fourth quarter will either rise as much as 3% from the same quarter a year ago, or remain flat.</p><p>Write to Joseph Pisani at joseph.pisani@wsj.com</p><p>Victoria's Secret Shares Rise on Buyback Plan, Holiday Sales</p>",
