  "text": "<p>    Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has expressed interest in buying a payments-technology firm to further build out its credit-card capabilities, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Goldman executives discussed acquiring Deserve, a fintech credit-card platform that the bank has close ties to, according to people familiar with the matter. Executives sounded out another fintech credit-card platform called Cardless and a payments company called CoreCard Corp., the people said. </p><p>   Outreach from Goldman's executives to Deserve executives began last year, people familiar with the matter said. The most recent overture came last month, they said. </p><p>   No official discussions are currently taking place between Goldman and the companies, the people said. </p><p>   A Goldman spokesman said the bank has already built technology platforms that enable it to help card partners grow their businesses and serve their customers. </p><p>   \"We have the ability to scale these businesses with our existing technology and are not currently looking for acquisitions in the space,\" the spokesman said. </p><p>   Long the epitome of high finance, Goldman has been trying to round out its investment-banking and trading units in part by growing its cards business. But progress has been slow. </p><p>   Goldman previously bid to take over the credit-card programs of JetBlue Airways Corp. and Macy's Inc. but lost out. The bank successfully bid to take over the General Motors Co. credit-card program in 2020, but technology glitches delayed the rollout, the Journal previously reported. </p><p>   In 2019, Goldman launched a credit card with Apple Inc., and Apple encourages cardholders to use the card with Apple Pay. </p><p>   Goldman recently announced a broad restructuring that included moving its card partnerships with Apple and GM into a new unit called Platform Solutions. </p><p>   Bulking up its payment technology could help Goldman better compete against bigger banks when bidding on credit-card partnerships, people familiar with the matter said. Executives wanted to better prepare for what they believed would be a string of tech companies that would want to quickly launch credit-card programs embedded within their apps, the people said. </p><p>   Goldman is CoreCard's biggest customer by consolidated revenue, according to a recent regulatory filing by CoreCard. </p><p>   Deserve currently powers credit cards for private student-loan lender Sallie Mae, financial-services startup GloriFi, BlockFi's crypto rewards credit card and others. </p><p>   Goldman became an investor in Deserve in 2019, and a Goldman managing director is on Deserve's board. The bank recently facilitated a credit line for Deserve. </p><p></p>",
