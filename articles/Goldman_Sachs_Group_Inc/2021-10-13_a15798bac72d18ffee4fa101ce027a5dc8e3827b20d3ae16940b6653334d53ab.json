  "title": "Technology:  FDA Authorizes  Tobacco-Flavored  Vuse E-Cigarette  ----  By Jennifer Maloney",
  "text": "<p>   The Food and Drug Administration authorized a tobacco-flavored e-cigarette made by tobacco giant Reynolds American Inc. and rejected several sweet or fruit-flavored refill cartridges the company wanted to bring back on the market. </p><p>   The decision signals the hard line the agency is taking on sweet and fruity e-cigarette flavors in a review it is conducting to determine which vaping products may remain on the U.S. market. Reynolds's Vuse Solo vaporizer and its tobacco-flavored refill cartridges are the first products to receive authorization as part of the review. </p><p>   To curb youth vaping, the FDA last year temporarily halted the sale of sweet and fruity e-cigarette refills. Manufacturers were allowed to submit those products for the agency's permission to resume their sales. The FDA rejected five flavors Reynolds submitted under the Vuse Solo brand, the company said. The agency said it is still reviewing Vuse Solo's menthol refill pods. Before the flavor restrictions took effect last year, the company sold Solo refills in flavors such as melon, chai, mint and berry. The FDA hasn't yet ruled on the company's most popular model, Vuse Alto, or two other Vuse devices. </p><p>   The authorization of Reynolds's Vuse Solo device is \"an important moment\" for the company and reflects years of company research aimed at ensuring that adults \"have access to innovative and potentially less harmful alternatives to traditional tobacco products,\" a Reynolds spokeswoman said. The company is studying the FDA's analysis of the rejected products, she said. </p><p>   The agency said its decision was informed by federal data released in September, showing Vuse is the second-most-popular brand among children and teens. Some 11% of high-school students who vaped in the past 30 days said they used Vuse, according to the survey. \"The agency takes these data very seriously,\" the FDA said. </p><p>   The agency noted the survey's findings that the most commonly used flavors among young people were fruit, candy and desserts, mint and menthol. </p><p>   The FDA's determinations on Reynolds's four Vuse e-cigarette models are important for parent British American Tobacco PLC, which has been trying to expand its e-cigarette market share in the U.S. Reynolds is the No. 2 e-cigarette maker in the U.S., with 28% of sales in stores tracked by Nielsen in the 52 weeks ended Sept. 25, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis. </p><p></p>",
