  "title": "U.S. stocks open lower as key Fed speaker suggests interest rates may rise much further; The 4,000 level has been a barrier for the S&P 500",
  "text": "<p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX fell 37 points, or 1%, at 3,921.</p><p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA retreated 184 points, or 0.6%, to 33,369.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP declined 100 points, or 0.9%, to 11,083.</p><p>Stocks finished lower on Wednesday for the second time in three sessions with the S&amp;P 500 once again failing to break above 4,000. The Dow fell 39 points, or 0.12%, to 33554, the S&amp;P 500 declined 33 points, or 0.83%, to 3959, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 175 points, or 1.54%, to 11184.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Investors pay close attention to what Bullard says about markets since he's known for speaking his mind, as Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group, said in a note to clients Thursday morning.</p><p>But it's possible he may have gone \"overboard\" by suggesting in a slide-show presentation that the Fed funds rate target may need to rise as high as 7%, Boockvar added. In any case, investors may be overreacting to his comments since Bullard won't have a vote on the Fed's policy-setting committee next year.</p><p>\"…[H]is comment today that interest rates might have to go to 7%, according to 'policy rules' to be sufficiently restrictive is now Bullard going overboard,\" Boockvar said in an emailed note.</p><p>Fed funds futures traders are presently anticipating that the key benchmark rate will peak somewhere between 4.75% and 5.5% next spring.</p><p>If there's anything to be gleaned from public commentary unleashed by Bullard and other Fed officials this week, it's that \"a rate-hike pause may not be coming soon, and cuts definitely aren't coming soon unless something breaks,\" said Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst at eToro.</p><p>Investment banks have been adjusting their expectations for where interest rates may peak next year, with Goldman Sachs Group GS calling for the Fed funds rate to peak at 5.25%. Also, Wednesday's stronger-than-expected retail sales number helped stoke fears that the Fed may need to be even more aggressive, diminishing hopes for a dovish pivot, as Deutsche Bank' Jim Reid said.</p><p>Perhaps this is one reason why the momentum that had carried the S&amp;P 500 to its highest level since mid-September has dissipated this week as the large-cap index has failed to close above 4,000.</p><p>\"After a strong rebound over recent days, the momentum behind risk assets [has] started to peter out…thanks to some hawkish comments from Fed officials, weak corporate earnings, as well as strong retail sales numbers that dampened hopes about a dovish pivot from the Fed,\" said Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank.</p><p>A spate of U.S. economic data was released early Thursday, including housing startsdata, which showed that new-home construction has slowed, jobless claims data which showed the number of Americans applying for benefits fell slightly, while the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said Thursday that its gauge of regional business activity sank to negative 19.4 in November from negative 8.7 in the prior month.</p><p>Aside from Bullard, a host of senior Fed officials have already made public remarks on Thursday. And Fed Governor Phillip Jefferson is scheduled to speak at 10:40 a.m. New York time.</p><p>Treasury yields shot higher on Thursday, with the yield on the 10-year note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y up 8.4 basis points to 3.777%.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Macy's Inc. stock M jumped after the department store chain beat consensus estimates for the third quarter and raised its full-year profit guidance.</p><p>* Kohl's Corp. KSS dropped after the department store chain reported fiscal third-quarter profit and revenue above expectations, but withdrew its full-year outlook citing \"significant\" macroeconomic headwinds and the unexpected transition of its chief executive officer.</p><p>* Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA inched higher after the companytopped adjusted earnings expectationsfor the latest quarter and said it was upsizing its buyback program.</p><p>* Nvidia Corp. NVDA shares ticked higher after the chip maker said modified servers to China mostly made up for an expected $400 million shortfall due to a U.S. ban on certain tech sales, and announced it's making progress in helping customers reduce high inventories. Nvidia reported third-quarter net income of $680 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $2.46 billion, or 97 cents a share, in the year-ago period.</p><p>* Cisco Systems Inc.'s CSCO stock rose after the networking-technology company delivered better-than-expected numberson the top and bottom line, and offered encouraging guidance.</p><p>U.S. stocks open lower as key Fed speaker suggests interest rates may rise much further</p>",
