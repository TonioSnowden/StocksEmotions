  "text": "<p>The practical challenge of working from home has proved surprisingly easy for many financial services companies to meet. However, a year after the coronavirus pandemic forced them to close their offices, the operational challenges have been replaced with a different worry: the risk of burnout among their people.</p> <p>As lockdowns take their toll on mental health, companies are having to find new ways to care for workers operating in a remote environment. The alternative may be dealing with an increase in negativity, lower productivity or losing staff altogether if they quit.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19feae61-01dc-4248-b98c-90aa34fccfb4\">Anecdotally</a>, cases of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/burnout\">burnout</a> appear to be rising in financial organisations, whose banking and consultancy services have remained in high demand during the pandemic.</p> <p>“How cohesive a culture is and how social and positive it is, those are directly correlated with business performance,” says Kira Schabram, professor at the Foster School of Business in Seattle. “Burnout directly predicts reduced performance and reduced commitment . . . people are far more likely to quit and far more likely to not work as hard for you.”</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.cipd.co.uk/Images/embedding-new-ways-working-post-pandemic_tcm18-83907.pdf\">survey</a> of more than 1,000 employers by the UK's Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, a professional body for HR managers, 47 per cent of respondents cited mental wellbeing as the main challenge of homeworking.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/press-releases/articles/poor-mental-health-costs-uk-employers-up-to-pound-45-billion-a-year.html\">And research</a> by consultancy Deloitte last year calculated that poor mental health costs employers in the UK up to £45bn a year.</p> <p>Classed as an <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases\">occupational syndrome</a> by the World Health Organization, burnout arises from “chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed”. Symptoms include exhaustion, cynicism and lower effectiveness.</p> <p>“What causes burnout is an imbalance between your demands and resources, so you get too many demands and too few resources,” says Paula Davis, founder of the <a href=\"https://stressandresilience.com/#\">Stress and Resilience Institute</a>, a US consultancy. “Resources” refers not only to time and energy but also to moments of “decompression”, such as travelling between meetings, holidays and dinners with friends. These have been taken away by the pandemic.</p> <p>In the US, a Stanford University <a href=\"https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj4746/f/60_million_fewer_commuting_hours_per_day_29_october_2020.pdf\">study</a> found that people have plugged the gap with more work instead of other recreational activities. According to the survey, Americans spent about 35 per cent of the time saved by not commuting on working longer hours at their jobs, with another 60 per cent going to other unpaid labour activities such as household chores and childcare.</p> <p>Some companies have set up community and wellness programmes including yoga sessions, granted extra days off and offered meditation app subscriptions to encourage employees to decompress. But Emma Mamo, head of workplace wellbeing at Mind, the UK mental health charity, says these initiatives are not enough if damaging practices — such as too many tight deadlines or late-night email exchanges — persist.</p> <p>“The things that really matter to people are about their workload, line manager relationship, and whether or not they feel valued,” she says.</p> <h2>Role models</h2> <p>In order to bring about true change, managers must lead by example, says Peter Brown, co-leader of the global people and organisation team at consultancy PwC. “Leadership needs to [provide a] role model [showing] that it's OK to take a break . . . saying, ‘Sorry, I can't do that because I'm taking an hour off, or I'm out with the kids',” he says. “Or, having been on Zoom nonstop, for some calls I'll dial in while walking the dog. It's about showing that kind of behaviour is acceptable.”</p> <p>Valentina Kristensen, director of growth and communications at start-up bank OakNorth, says being able to tell the difference between overwork and working flexible hours depends on close relationships with employees.</p> <p>“We can see those people who are prone to opening their laptops early in the morning, we can see what time emails are being sent . . . But everyone has personal circumstances,” she says. “Ideally, if people have their cameras on, if you can see someone is looking physically extremely tired, that is a very clear indicator. That's why having those regular catch-ups is important.”</p> <p>Kristensen adds that she has had to be conscious of her own behaviour. “In the past 12 months, when there's not as much going on from a social perspective, I think ‘Oh well, why don't I just use that time to work because otherwise I'll be bored at home doing nothing'. We've been consciously trying to avoid that to avoid burnout.”</p> <p>Coinbase, the cryptocurrency exchange platform, which switched to a <a href=\"https://blog.coinbase.com/post-covid-19-coinbase-will-be-a-remote-first-company-cdac6e621df7\">“remote first”</a> working model last year, says that training employees to recognise these behaviour signals is crucial. “That physical separation [of home and work] doesn't exist in the same way, so what it requires is individuals to be much better at setting boundaries,” says Dominique Baillet, global head of employee experience, diversity and inclusion at Coinbase. “It's about really focusing on coaching leaders to manage, and coaching team members on how to build greater resilience.”</p> <p>If companies do not address these challenges, they risk losing people and may struggle to attract fresh talent. Last month, when a group of Goldman Sachs analysts voiced <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d853d6b4-1546-4435-9b7e-99e3e9475d50\">concern about their workload</a>, most said they were unlikely to stay at the bank or recommend it to others if working conditions did not improve.</p> <p>“Even in the pandemic we're seeing the buoyancy of the recruitment market,” says Brown at PwC. “Talented people with in-demand skills have a choice and can use it.”</p><p>Source: Antonia Cundy 2021 'Remote working fuels burnout in finance sector' FT.com 15 April.
