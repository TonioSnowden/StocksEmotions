  "text": "<p>* S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 rose 24 points, or 0.6%, to 3857</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 rose 154 points, or 0.5%, to 31200</p><p>* Nasdaq 100 futures NQ00 gained 74 points, or 0.6%, to 11982</p><p>On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 216 points, or 0.69%, to 31073, the S&amp;P 500 SPX declined 32 points, or 0.84%, to 3831, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped 92 points, or 0.81%, to 11360. The S&amp;P 500 has fallen six of the last seven sessions and has shed 19.6% year-to-date.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Trading is positive but wary Tuesday after a report suggesting Apple AAPL was slowing hiring and spending revived concerns that higher borrowing costs and rampant inflation is damping corporate confidence.</p><p>The fears are reflected in the U.S. bond market, too. As the Federal Reserve has tightened monetary policy, investors have pushed 2-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD02Y above 10-year yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y, an inversion of the yield curve that is deemed a harbinger of potential recession.</p><p>The Apple news Tuesday highlighted a dispiriting trend, noted Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank. \"Elon Musk recently announced he would cut 10% of jobs in Tesla, because he has a bad feeling about the economy. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Snap and even Goldman announced they would need less people to work for them as businesses would slow.\"</p><p>The reversal in Monday's session left the S&amp;P 500 index below its 50-day moving average for the 60th consecutive day. That's its longest such run since 2008 and suggests the market's downtrend remains intact.</p><p>Underpinning sentiment, however, and helping deliver gains on Tuesday, is a mostly positive second-quarter earnings reporting season, where 57% of those companies to have reported so far have beaten earnings per share and revenue expectations, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>Pre-market trading suggests IBM IBM results were not well-received, however. The tech company beat expectations, but worries about how a strong dollar may impact future earnings pushed the stock lower by 4.8% $131.50.</p><p>Earnings reports coming on Tuesday include Lockheed Martin LMT, J&amp;J JNJ and after the closing bell, Netflix NFLX.</p><p>More housing data — building permits and housing starts, both for June — are set for release at 8.30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>How are other assets faring</p><p>* U.S. crude futures CL.1 fell 0.4% to $102.21 a barrel, losing early gains that came after news that Russia's Gazprom hadclaimed force majeure on some buyers highlighted tensions in the energy space.</p><p>* The ICE Dollar index DXY fell 0.6% to 106.71, as the euro EURUSD jumped on reports the European Central Bank was considering a 50 basis point rate hike on Thursday.</p><p>* Bitcoin BTCUSD advanced 1.9% to $21921.</p><p>* Asia markets were mixed following Wall Street's overnight reversal. Hong Kong's Hang Seng HK:HSI fell 0.9% and the Shanghai Composite CN:SHCOMP was flat. Japan returned from a day off to play catch-up, the Nikkei 225 JP:NIK adding 0.65%. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 XX:SXXP fell 0.7%.</p><p>* Growth concerns pushed copper futures HG00 down 1.3% to $3.025 a pound.</p><p>U.S. stock futures recover some ground after Apple news revives recession fears</p>",
