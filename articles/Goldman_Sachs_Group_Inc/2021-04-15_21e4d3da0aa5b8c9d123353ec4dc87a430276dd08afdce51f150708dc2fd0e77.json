  "text": "<p>Deliveroo's maiden trading update as a listed company revealed order volumes more than doubling last quarter. But the takeaway ordering service said it was “taking a prudent approach to our full-year guidance” as lockdown restrictions are lifted. </p> <p>Group orders were up 114 per cent year on year to 71m for a gross transaction value of £1.65bn, up 130 per cent versus last year and 23 per cent ahead of the fourth quarter, the company said. Monthly active users rose by 91 per cent to 7.1m.</p> <p>Full year targets were unchanged, requiring gross transaction value growth of between 30 and 40 per cent and a gross profit margin of 7.5 to 8 per cent.</p> <p>Will Shu, Deliveroo's founder and chief executive, said he was “delighted” with the performance. “Demand has been strong in both the UK &amp; Ireland and international markets driven by record new consumer growth and sustained engagement from our existing consumers,” he said in a statement. “This is our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, but we are mindful of the uncertain impact of the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions.”</p> <p>Deliveroo shares closed at 268p on Wednesday, down 31 per cent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bdf6ac6b-46b5-4f7a-90db-291d7fd2898d\">since flotation</a> on the last day of March. </p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>THG</strong>, the online cosmetics and protein powder retailer formerly known as The Hut Group, plans to step up the pace of acquisitions with £250m a year earmarked for bolt-on deals. The recently floated company said first-quarter trading had been ahead of expectations with revenue up 58 per cent year on year. THG left unchanged an upgraded target to increase revenue this year by between 30 and 35 per cent. Its annual results showed a £481.8m operating loss, caused largely by non-cash charges to cover share-based payments and asset value writedowns.</p> <p>Builders' merchant <strong>Travis Perkins</strong> said it has made an “encouraging” start to the year. The company said group like-for-like sales growth excluding its Wickes chain, which will be demerged this month, totalled 17.4 per cent in the first quarter.</p> <p>A first-quarter trading update from <strong>Entain</strong>, the owner of Ladbrokes bookmakers, revealed strong online growth in line with expectations. Online net gaming revenue grew 33 per cent in the quarter with a strong performance reported in all major markets except Germany, where regulatory changes crimped takings. The forced closure of its retail business meant high street bookmaking revenue dropped 99 per cent in the period, so the group total net gaming revenue was down 13 per cent. </p> <p><strong>AO World</strong>, the online electricals retailer, said momentum from last year had continued with group revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter ended March up 62 per cent year on year to £1.66bn. It said full-year adjusted ebitda will match market expectations at between £63m and £72m, up from £19.6m the year before, in spite of Covid-related costs. The company also flagged that it will book a one-off, non-cash charge of about £15m to cover warranty plan cancellations.</p> <p><strong>Naked Wines</strong>, the wine subscription&#xa0;retailer, said sales growth for its year ended March exceeded previous guidance thanks to a surge in demand from the US. Sales rose 68 per cent at a group level and by 75 per cent in the US, which now accounts for approximately 45 per cent of total sales, the company said. </p> <p><strong>Wizz Air</strong> said it expects a reported net loss for the year ended March of between €570m and €590m.&#xa0;The airline said it maintains a strong liquidity position with total cash and equivalents of €1.6bn at the year end versus fourth-quarter cash burn of €87m. Wizz said it was not in a position to provide guidance for the current financial year.</p> <p>One of <strong>London Stock Exchange Group</strong>'s largest shareholders, Lindsell Train, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6e2503e-3268-46c9-86b8-67ee2383faa7\">backed extra spending</a> to fix longstanding problems at its new $27bn purchase Refinitiv, saying the group should invest “more and sooner if necessary”. The fund manager told investors it was important “not to lose sight of the strategic benefit of the deal” after LSE shares lost a fifth of their value last month.</p> <p><strong>Darktrace</strong> has issued <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5302ce7c-2d58-4e8b-843e-a181ee3a2bd1\">contradictory information</a> about the role of British tech billionaire Mike Lynch, who has been charged with fraud in the US, complicating the cyber security company's efforts to distance itself from the Autonomy founder ahead of its potential £3bn float. In 2018, Darktrace told the FT that Lynch had left its advisory council the previous year as explanation for why he was removed from its website. But the company's stock market registration document published this week says he remained on the body until March 2021.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p>Stock market investors valued&#xa0;<strong>Coinbase</strong>&#xa0;at $75.9bn in its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50327259-f554-4dad-8902-7ae9c124faa1\">debut on Nasdaq</a>, the first listing of a major cryptocurrency exchange and a moment of validation for the digital asset class some 12 years after the creation of bitcoin. Shares in Coinbase, which holds assets for 56m retail investors, opened at $381 and closed at $328, giving it a market capitalisation of $65.4bn — similar to that of New York Stock Exchange-parent ICE.</p> <p>Shares in <strong>Dell Technologies</strong> jumped 9 per cent in after-market trading on Wednesday after the US computer maker said it would receive a cash dividend of nearly $10bn in connection with the spin-off of its stake in VMware, easing pressure on its balance sheet. Dell, which owns 81 per cent of the data centre software company, said VMware would pay out $11.5bn-$12bn in total as a special dividend to all of its shareholders.</p> <p>Three of the largest US banks reported higher than expected profits on Wednesday, fuelled by breakneck growth in investment banking fees, buoyant capital markets and lower credit costs because of an improving economy. <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> reported a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0595526e-48fa-48ff-a594-d219f15b54a4\">57 per cent surge in investment banking fees</a> while <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> recorded its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5082365e-ccb3-437d-86bf-4255412c7c73\">highest return on equity</a> since 2009. However <strong>Wells Fargo</strong>, which does not have a significant trading business, reported a 45 per cent fall in pre-provision profit for the quarter.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Anjli Raval</strong> <br>A net zero promise was an easy first step for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03bc2e75-80a2-440b-b766-9110f636233f\">the major oil companies</a>. But now investors, activists and the public need to ask how net zero is defined and whether company pledges will meaningfully reduce absolute emissions. </p> <p><strong>Bryce Elder</strong> <br>Under newish chief executive Ken Murphy, Tesco has switched from a growth stock to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6fc046c-9b2f-413c-8fa6-e928ada604bf\">a cash cow</a>. Yet an upward re-rating of the stock based on reliable cash flows requires confidence that cash flows are reliable and such a moment looks a while off.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
