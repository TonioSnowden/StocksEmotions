  "title": "Vladimir Putin Says Russia Will Honor Gas Commitments, but Warns of New Nord Stream Curbs; Russia's president says sanctions could prevent additional maintenance on components for the pipeline for Russian gas to Europe",
  "text": "<p>In comments late Tuesday after his visit to Tehran, Mr. Putin said that Kremlin-controlled energy exporter Gazprom PJSC, pipeline operator's majority shareholder, \"has always fulfilled and will fulfill all of its obligations.\"</p><p>But the Russian president added that flows might fall to some 20% of capacity as soon as next week if a pipeline turbine that was undergoing repairs in Canada isn't returned to Russia soon. Mr. Putin said that another turbine had to go for maintenance on July 26.</p><p>Even before the maintenance began, Gazprom last month cut deliveries on the pipeline to 40% of its capacity, blaming Canadian sanctions that had prevented the return of the turbine being repaired there. European officials have dismissed the turbine explanation as a pretext for Moscow to try and wreak economic havoc on the continent.</p><p>Germany has been racing to return the turbine to Russia after Canada earlier this month tweaked its own sanctions, allowing turbines for the Nord Stream pipeline to be repaired and returned to Russia.</p><p>The European Union is pressing governments to step up their energy-conservation campaigns, rolling out new plans for possible rationing on Wednesday. The commission's plan is expected to offer guidelines for curbing energy use and establish criteria governments can use to determine which industries to give priority to if there isn't enough gas to go around. The guidelines also call for public buildings to limit air conditioning to 77 degrees Fahrenheit and cap thermostats at about 66 degrees during colder months.</p><p>Gazprom has invoked force majeure for its failure to deliver contractually agreed natural-gas shipments in recent weeks, according to European energy companies. It isn't clear whether the notice—a legal declaration that exempts the company from fulfilling contractual obligations because of circumstances outside its control—covers a potential decision by Russia not to resume Nord Stream flows after the maintenance.</p><p>While some European officials have in recent days cast doubt on whether Nord Stream would come back online on Thursday, Mr. Putin's comments helped fuel expectations the pipeline would restart. Separately, flows of gas through the pipeline spiked several times on Tuesday, which analysts say could be pressure tests ahead of the end of the maintenance.</p><p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expected the pipeline to come back online Thursday at its pre-maintenance capacity of 40%.</p><p>A full stop \"would remove flexibility from Russia's supply decisions, once you're at zero, there's only one place to go: up,\" the bank wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday, adding that such a scenario would also deprive Russia of gas revenues.</p><p>But Mr. Putin's new warning that the flows could be curbed to 20% next week shows that Moscow will continue to use gas to squeeze Europe, even if it doesn't completely cut it off, analysts say.</p><p>\"It's absolutely clear that Moscow is cutting supplies for geopolitical reasons—it wants to create a European gas crisis this winter to bring Europe to its knees to the point where it cuts support to Ukraine and forces Kyiv to concede to Moscow's demands,\" said Timothy Ash, senior strategist for BlueBay Asset Management LLP in London.</p><p>Mr. Putin also warned the West that its plan to cap the prices of Russian oil would rock global markets and push prices up.</p><p>\"Now we are hearing all sorts of crazy ideas about limiting the volume of Russian oil and capping the Russian oil price,\" Mr. Putin said. \"Oil prices will skyrocket,\" he added.</p><p>Write to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com</p><p>Vladimir Putin Says Russia Will Honor Gas Commitments, but Warns of New Nord Stream Curbs</p>",
