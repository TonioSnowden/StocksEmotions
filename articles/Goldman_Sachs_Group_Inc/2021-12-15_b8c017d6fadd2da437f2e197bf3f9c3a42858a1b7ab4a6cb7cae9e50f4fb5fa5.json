  "title": "China-U.S. Tension Mars Biotech Giant BeiGene's Shanghai Debut; Goldman-sponsored deal is the largest healthcare IPO of 2021",
  "text": "<p>Beijing-based BeiGene had raised 22.2 billion yuan, equivalent to $3.5 billion, in the largest healthcare IPO globally this year. Underwriters have an option to increase the deal's final size by up to 15%.</p><p>BeiGene's shares tumbled Wednesday on the Nasdaq-style STAR Market, which is also known as the Science and Technology Innovation Board, to close at 160.98 yuan apiece.</p><p>The IPO had priced at 192.60 yuan on Dec. 3, an 11% premium to that day's Hong Kong closing price. It received cornerstone investments from Chinese state-backed investors, including the Social Security Fund and China Taiping Insurance, as well as the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.</p><p>BeiGene, which has yet to turn a profit, said it intended to use most of the proceeds on research and development. The company reported $827.7 million in net losses in the first three quarters of this year.</p><p>The high premium relative to the Hong Kong-traded shares and threats of potential U.S. sanctions on Chinese biotech companies contributed to BeiGene's slide, said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities.</p><p>The STAR Market has more professional investors who are familiar with biotech than the wider market, said Mr. Pang. \"Companies like BeiGene, which are yet to be profitable and require high capital expenditures on research and development, tend to face more investor scrutiny,\" he said.</p><p>The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that the Biden administration will add more Chinese companies, including those in the tech and biotech sectors, to its export and investment blacklists. Hong Kong and Shanghai-listed biotech stocks fell on the report, which didn't name any biotech sanctions targets.</p><p>Global banks have rushed to gain a deeper foothold in China's onshore financial markets, after Beijing removed ownership restrictions on foreign firms in a number of financial services, such as investment banking and mutual-fund management.</p><p>Most Wall Street banks have obtained or applied for licenses to underwrite, trade and sell yuan-denominated securities. However, getting actual businesses off the ground has remained elusive.</p><p>BeiGene was Goldman's first onshore IPO sponsorship since taking control of its local joint venture in March 2020. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., which was the first U.S. bank to have a majority-owned local securities unit, hasn't sponsored an IPO since getting approval to set up shop in March 2019.</p><p>Banks face competition from more entrenched Chinese players and must adhere to distinct local regulations. For instance, STAR IPO sponsors must buy shares in the deals they underwrite and hold them for at least two years. This co-investment rule has been a sticking point for Western banks, because it locks up capital and could create conflicts of interest.</p><p>Before Goldman, UBS Group AG was the only foreign bank to sponsor STAR listings, handling two deals through its UBS Securities unit. The local subsidiary effectively made use of its parent's balance sheet to meet the co-investment requirements.</p><p>In the BeiGene deal, the two sponsors each put up 443 million yuan, the equivalent of $69.6 million, to buy 2% of the shares on offer and agreed to hold them for two years. Goldman used an equity-investment subsidiary to hold the shares, after getting an alternative investment license issued separately by the regulators.</p><p>BeiGene was founded in 2010 by China-born biochemist Xiaodong Wang and American serial entrepreneur John Oyler and focuses on oncology. The company has 11 drugs in clinical trials or commercial use, including Brukinsa, a lymphoma treatment that was the first Chinese cancer drug to receive U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.</p><p>JPMorgan, Citic Securities Co. and Guotai Junan Securities Co. acted as joint lead underwriters on the deal.</p><p>Write to Jing Yang at Jing.Yang@wsj.com</p><p>China-U.S. Tension Mars Biotech Giant BeiGene's Shanghai Debut</p>",
