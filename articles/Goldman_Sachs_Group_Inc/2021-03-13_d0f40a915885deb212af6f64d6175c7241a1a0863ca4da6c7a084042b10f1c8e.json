  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Texas Grid Operator Discussed Financing  ----  By Alexander Gladstone and Andrew Scurria",
  "text": "<p>   The Texas grid operator has held talks with financial institutions including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. about potential financing options to address a more than $3 billion shortfall in electricity payments as some market participants balk at paying their share, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The Electric Reliability Council of Texas has held preliminary discussions with investment bankers from Goldman Sachs about measures, such as a potential credit facility, that would cover amounts that electricity buyers haven't paid for after last month's energy crisis, these people said. </p><p>   Ercot, which acts as the payment clearinghouse for electricity buyers and sellers, has issued large bills for power purchased as a winter freeze swept the state, spiking energy prices. Some municipal utilities, electric cooperatives and electricity retailers have disputed the bills, while others have declared bankruptcy or signaled they might seek court protection. </p><p>   Ercot said Thursday it was short nearly $3.1 billion in required payments, having previously said it was short $2.1 billion. On Friday, San Antonio's public power utility CPS Energy filed a lawsuit against Ercot, seeking to prevent the grid operator from trying to recoup from CPS the costs that other energy retailers haven't paid. </p><p>   Ercot let power prices soar when last month's winter storm swept Texas, as demand for electricity spiked and some power generators couldn't function due to fuel shortages and frozen equipment. </p><p>   An Ercot spokeswoman said Friday that when emergency conditions ended, \"we saw market participants reporting financial distress and we wanted to understand a wide range of potential options for state leaders.\" </p><p>   \"We had preliminary discussions with a number of companies in the financial markets to discuss options,\" the spokeswoman said. </p><p>   CPS, which ran up $1.1 billion in costs buying electricity and natural gas last month, said Ercot's \"extreme confiscatory prices have caused many providers within the Ercot system to become insolvent,\" with as many as 22 market participants at risk of failing. </p><p>   When market participants can't settle their bills, Ercot normally spreads the cost among the remaining electric retailers, municipal power companies and others purchasing electricity. CPS said Ercot was attempting to place the \"inequitable burden\" of its own failures on CPS and its customers. </p><p>   Ercot declined to comment on the lawsuit, filed in Bexar County District Court. </p><p>   \"We are fighting to protect our customers from the financial impacts of the systemic failure of the Ercot market and the outrageous and unlawful costs associated with that failure,\" CPS President and CEO Paula Gold-Williams said. </p><p>   Goldman and other institutions have floated the idea of arranging a credit facility to cover the shortfall and stabilize the state energy market, the people familiar with the matter said. The discussions are fluid and Ercot might not pursue such a deal, the people said. </p><p>   The CPS lawsuit seeks an injunction preventing Ercot from tapping the utility's credit to help fill the shortfall. </p><p>   \"We are not alone,\" San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg said. \"What this represents is a collapse of the Texas energy market.\" </p><p>   The northern Texas city of Denton has filed a similar lawsuit alleging that Ercot had mounted an \"illegal and unconstitutional raid\" on cities that operate municipal utilities. In court papers, Ercot has said its protocols are meant to keep the state's energy market afloat in the event of difficulties collecting from purchasers. </p><p>   For a brief period last month, Ercot ordered prices to go to the maximum level of $9,000 a megawatt-hour, compared with the average price of roughly $22 a megawatt-hour in 2020. The move was intended to spur generators to produce more power, but many of them had frozen equipment or were unable to access fuel and couldn't generate electricity for any price. </p><p>   So far, invoices stemming from the winter storm have caused two major bankruptcy filings from energy players in the state. </p><p></p>",
