  "title": "Prices for New Homes in China Slide Further; Government support measures for the industry have yet to take hold after a yearlong regulatory campaign aimed at reining in developers' debt levels",
  "text": "<p>Just 23 of the 70 Chinese cities tracked by the government reported yearly growth in average new-home prices, down from 30 cities in April.</p><p>Compared with the previous month, average new-home prices fell 0.17%, marking the ninth consecutive monthly decline, according to calculations based on statistics bureau data.</p><p>A day earlier, official data showed home sales by volume, a key indicator of buyer demand, falling 34.5% in the first five months of 2022 when compared with the same period a year earlier.</p><p>The growing pains in China's real-estate sector coincide with what appears to be a global retreat from property as interest rates rise. In the U.S., higher borrowing costs helped send confidence among home builders lower in June for a sixth consecutive month, the National Association of Home Builders said Wednesday.</p><p>In China, the headwinds have been evident for some time, showing up first in developers' earnings numbers and now, increasingly, in official home-price data.</p><p>\"The real estate market has been in a downward spiral since the beginning of the year,\" Fu Linghui, a spokesman for China's statistics bureau, said in a briefing Wednesday. He added, however, that recent internal research had shown signs of a recovery that he said would become more evident in the second half of the year as stimulus measures to reverse the damage begin to take hold.</p><p>In recent months, more than a hundred Chinese cities have taken easing steps, including lowering down-payment requirements, lifting curbs on home purchases and offering subsidies to boost home-buying demand.</p><p>On the monetary policy front, China's central bank last month cut interest rates for first-time home buyers, while slashing its benchmark reference rate for mortgages by 0.15 percentage point.</p><p>Despite the efforts at reversing some of the damage, Goldman Sachs economists told clients in a note Thursday that they expect the property sector slowdown to wipe 1.4 percentage points from this year's growth in the headline gross domestic product figure.</p><p>Beijing has said it is aiming to expand GDP this year by about 5.5% from a year earlier, a target that many economists now deem impossible as widespread Covid-19 containment measures have shut down Shanghai and other parts of the country for weeks.</p><p>Sheng Guoqing, an analyst at the statistics bureau, noted that while monthly home prices have been sliding for nine straight months, the pace eased somewhat in May. More of the 70 cities tracked by the statistics bureau also reported average home-price increases on a monthly basisâ€”25 cities compared with April's 18 cities.</p><p>Home prices in first-tier cities, which include economic dynamos Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, rose 0.4% in May from the previous month, accelerating from a 0.2% month-over-month increase in April, Mr. Sheng said. Prices in second-tier and third-tier cities either stayed flat or declined more slowly on a monthly basis, he added.</p><p>Bingyan Wang contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com</p><p>Prices for New Homes in China Slide Further</p>",
