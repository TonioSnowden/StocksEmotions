Every party conference is attended by three sorts of people. There are those who are there because it's part of the job (the party's frontbenchers, power brokers, political journalists and delegates). There are people who are there for fun (the party's keenest activists). And then there are the ones who are there because they feel they need to be: public affairs professionals, lobbyists and business leaders. </p> <p>Talk to that latter group at the Labour party conference and they'll tell you that Labour is heading back to government. Talk to MPs and activists and they'll tell you that they really <em>hope </em>Labour is heading back to government, but they have big (and sincere) fears that the party's path back to power is not comfortably clear. </p> <p>Does this just reflect that lobbyists and business leaders have a clearer and more dispassionate view of the economic and social pressures helping to increase the Labour poll lead at the moment? Some thoughts on both that and the crisis facing the UK in today's note. </p>  <p><em>Inside Politics is edited by Georgina Quach.

Here's today's, featured in Chris Giles's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fab6aea1-eac8-481e-a151-4f92e17ff2fc\">analysis of what might come next for Britain</a>:</p> <p>The IMF, which surveys the global economic system for early warning signs of problems, has launched an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06962055-6b3d-4712-814f-acea3cb9e082\">extraordinary attack</a> on the UK government's plans and urged a rethink. Kwarteng will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd58ba2a-17e4-4b71-bb6e-1717fbdc6e78\">pledge</a> that the UK's debt will fall in five years, under a new medium-term fiscal plan which comes out in November, along with official forecasts. Huw Pill, the Bank of England's chief economist, then <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a78f11d-eb99-473b-9169-2685048f8d2b\">warned that the government's plans</a> would require a “significant monetary response”. </p> <p>Kwarteng's ambitious programme of tax cuts means finding £45bn worth of savings by 2026-27 just to stand still, and to actually start reducing the UK's debt means finding a much bigger set of cuts. </p> <p>The easiest cut, politically speaking, is to the UK's foreign aid budget, though that of course comes at a cost to the UK's foreign policy aims and at a social cost to the world's poorest. But that also still only gets you, at most, £12bn of cuts. In 2015 the Conservatives pledged to cut welfare by £12bn, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f374951c-03a1-11e5-a70f-00144feabdc0\">most of those reductions</a> in spending have not been forthcoming either. </p> <p>This was the implicit argument of Rishi Sunak's leadership campaign: given that the UK electorate (and indeed, the parliamentary Conservative party) have a limited appetite for further cuts to public spending, taxes are going to have to rise. That argument remains, in my view, wholly persuasive and I don't see how the Truss government can avoid either reversing its tax cuts or a deepening economic crisis. Yes, in theory they can fix the problem through spending cuts, but in practice? I doubt it. I also doubt that the growing tensions, first reported by Sky News and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a78f11d-eb99-473b-9169-2685048f8d2b\">confirmed to George and Seb</a>, between Liz Truss and Kwarteng, would not grow further as a result. </p> <p>I'm dubious, too, that the government can really make it to late November, or even to the end of Conservative party conference next week, before setting out its plans in greater detail. </p> <h1>It's de history of de Labour party</h1> <p>Why, then, do so many senior figures in Labour fear that they might still lose the next election? </p> <p>Well, one reason is the party's history: the Labour party loses an awful lot and almost everyone in the Labour party is either haunted by its shock defeats in 1992 and 2015, when the party lost despite enjoying a lead in the opinion polls, or its repeated defeats in the 2010s, the 1980s or the 1950s.</p> <p>That influences how the media covers the Labour party too. After Sir Keir Starmer's conference speech, I was talking with some hacks from various other papers, and while our general analysis was fairly favourable, that sneaking suspicion that Labour will again fall short is hard to wholly eradicate. </p> <p>Labour has real strengths. Janan Ganesh's argument that Starmer's achievements are undervalued by the UK's political class <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55094fb7-456b-408b-b93f-7b5c9797ed2b\">is well made</a>. Starmer not only enjoys a powerful position on the party's ruling national executive committee, but he has managed to move the party much further from the Corbynite platform than many believed possible.</p> <p>But there are, I would say, a couple of real risk factors. The first is that the crisis facing Liz Truss's government means that the Conservatives will once again change leader, and that the new leader — which might perhaps be Rishi Sunak — will be one who is specifically chosen to negate some of Starmer's political strengths.</p> <p>The second is that the argument over the scale of the UK's economic problems forces the political conversation on to a territory Labour is keen to avoid: that of tax rises. Don't forget that of the party's big pledges at this conference, their commitment to introduce free breakfast clubs and to increase spending on the NHS is funded by restoring the additional rate of tax (a lever that is only available to them thanks to Kwasi Kwarteng and Liz Truss) and their climate pledges are funded by borrowing (which may become more difficult thanks to Kwasi Kwarteng and Liz Truss).</p> <p>Successful oppositions need to do two things: the first is to sound like they have a serious and credible plan to fund what they want to do, whether that is cutting taxes or increasing spending. The second is to sound like they have a serious and convincing solution to the problems of the day. The UK's present set of crises make it very hard for Labour to do both of those things. Starmer managed it well yesterday — but that challenge is not going to get any easier between now and the next election, unless Trussonomics manages to spring an unexpected success. </p> <h1>Now try this</h1> <p>I took the last train out of Liverpool last night and am very glad to be back home in my own flat and my own bed. But I miss <a href=\"https://malmohanover.co.uk/\">Malmo</a>, the lovely and friendly café opposite my hotel. On the train back, I finished Tayari Jones's <em>Silver Sparrow</em>, which tells the story of two half-sisters, divided by a great deal but united by their bigamist father. It's a fantastic book: better, I think, even than Jones's breakout novel, <em>An American Marriage.</em></p> <h1>Top stories today</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>‘A labour moment' </strong>| Sir Keir Starmer has announced that Labour would set up a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11d09714-5a5b-49d7-9375-f7d8183c3f66\">publicly owned energy group with the ability</a> to invest directly in renewable energy and nuclear projects within the first year of being in power.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Kwarteng rushes to reassure bankers </strong>| Yesterday the chancellor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95dd83b5-5c15-4fdd-93f9-545b8b489acc\">told a group of leading insurers and asset managers</a> that he was “confident” in his economic plan and later spoke to Conservative MPs to calm fears that the government had lost control of the economic situation.
