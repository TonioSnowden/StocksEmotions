  "text": "<p>Berkshire BRK.ABRK.B disclosed in a late Wednesday filing that it owned 120.95 million shares of HP HPQ after buying shares in recent days. That position is worth about $4.2 billion and represents a roughly 11% stake in the company.</p><p>The stock rose nearly 10% in after-hours trading.</p><p>“HP is committed to one of the largest share-repurchase programs (relative to market cap) within our coverage, so we think Berkshire's involvement makes sense,” Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a note to clients.</p><p>While he said he didn't believe that Berkshire's investment in HP would drive significant changes to HP's business, he deemed the high-profile stake a “validation of HPQ's strategy/capital return program,” noting that Berkshire began purchasing shares after HP announced plans to purchase the workplace-technologies company Poly for $3.3 billion late last month.</p><p>Berkshire's HP stake indicates that Buffett sees value in HP's business, though several analysts have sounded cautious lately on the market for personal computers following a pandemic-driven boom.</p><p>“Specifically, we believe PC and consumer hardware spending will be pressured as supply improves and demand normalizes after two years of above-trend growth,” Morgan Stanley's Erik Woodring wrote in explaining his March 31 downgrades of HP and Dell Inc. DELL shares.</p><p>See more: Fears about end of pandemic PC boom lead to downgrades for AMD, HP and Dell, and all their stocks are falling</p><p>Don't miss: Dell stock downgraded as Goldman Sachs joins the chorus with PC-market concerns</p><p>Shares of HP have lost 9.7% over the past three months as the S&amp;P 500 SPX has dropped 4.6%.</p>",
