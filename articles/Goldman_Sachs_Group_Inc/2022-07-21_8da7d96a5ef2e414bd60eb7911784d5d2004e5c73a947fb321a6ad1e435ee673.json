  "text": "<p>   LONDON -- Former U.K. treasury chief Rishi Sunak will face off against Foreign Secretary Liz Truss in the final round of the Conservative Party's unpredictable contest to find Britain's next prime minister. </p><p>   Conservative lawmakers Wednesday selected the two candidates after several rounds of votes. Mr. Sunak and Ms. Truss will tour the U.K. to try to win over the 160,000 rank-and-file members of the Conservative Party. Those wider Conservative members will vote for the new head of their party, who would automatically become prime minister. </p><p>   The result is expected on Sept. 5. Current Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was ousted by his own party following a string of scandals, officially will leave office the next day. </p><p>   Ms. Truss is the oddsmakers' favorite to become the next prime minister. Several polls show she is preferred over Mr. Sunak by Conservative members. However, those polls have moved wildly, and the membership doesn't appear deeply wedded to any one candidate. </p><p>   Mr. Sunak got 137 Tory lawmakers to back him on Wednesday and Ms. Truss received 113 votes. Penny Mordaunt, a trade minister, was knocked out of the race. </p><p>   The contest pitches two politicians who are promising to break with the Mr. Johnson's turbulent style to steer the nation through a period of economic uncertainty and the biggest fall in real wages in over two decades. It also comes as Britain plays a key role in forging Western unity against Russia's Ukraine invasion. </p><p>    Ms. Truss, 46 years old, has painted herself as the candidate of the right of the party, championing a small state, hawkish foreign policy and rapid tax cuts. Ms. Truss, who is regularly photographed dressed like her Tory idol, the former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, says she has the willpower to put radical changes in place to jolt Britain's inflation-stricken economy into growth mode. \"I am ready to hit the ground from day one,\" she said. </p><p>   The 42-year-old Mr. Sunak, a millionaire former financier, has sold himself as the candidate of economic realism. The former chancellor who once worked at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Sunak says taxes can't be cut until inflation, running at a 40-year-high, is brought under control. He says Ms. Truss's economic plan relies on borrowing, which could hurt the economy in the long term. </p><p>   Both have a major flaw, in that they are seen as continuity candidates from Mr. Johnson's three-year time in Downing Street, during which the Tories were dragged down in the polls following several scandals. </p><p>   In the short term, they must appeal to the small chunk of the British electorate that consists of Tory members. The candidates are expected to pitch small variations of the same conservative recipe to Tory members, who are on average older and richer than Britons as a whole. The broad policy lines will be a smaller state, tough immigration rules, support for the war in Ukraine, sustained military spending and patriotism. </p><p>   On Wednesday Mr. Johnson gave his final question and answers in Parliament before it shuts for the summer recess. \"Hasta la vista, baby!\" he said, as Conservatives cheered. </p><p></p>",
