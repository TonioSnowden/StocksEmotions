  "text": "<p>\n  1. When was it first cool for guys to wear jewelry? </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  History is filled with bejeweled men: Maasai warriors and their colorful beaded necklaces; Ancient Egypt's pharaohs, who wore elaborate chest-pieces with so much devotion they literally took them to the grave; Celtic warriors who wouldn't leave the thatched-roof house without their favorite torc (a sort of metal choker); and the many dandy kings of Europe, like Henry VIII, who held court festooned with jewels, necklaces and rings. When French jeweler Cartier made the excessively opulent Patiala Necklace in 1928, it wasn't for a female client. It was commissioned for and worn by the Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala -- and he rocked every single one of its 2,930 diamonds. Throughout known history, men at the height of their power have been inclined to show it off with a little bling. So experimenting with a bracelet here or an extra ring there is really not as wild as you think. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  2. I'm intrigued by gems but I'm no Maharaja. What are some easy-to-wear stones for guys? </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Stick to stones in earthy tones, advised Los Angeles stylist Matt Goldman. Tiger's-eye, a type of quartz reminiscent of polished wood grain, and malachite, the dynamic green mineral, are good starter options. Pieces with a \"natural, earth vibe\" are generally easier for guys to wear than conspicuously glam jewelry, said Mr. Goldman. But if you're a decadent sort who wants to up the opulence, look for dark gems like opals, emeralds and rubies. Necklace, $1,598, MateoNewYork.com </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  3. I feel like my wedding band looks lonely. Can I wear more rings? How many is too many? </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The late Karl Lagerfeld wore fistfuls of chunky Chrome Hearts rings. He was also a fashion visionary. \"There are men, as women, who can get away with a handful, and there are men who wouldn't wear anything more than one,\" said Brooke Garber Neidich, owner and creative director of jewelry brand Sidney Garber. A ring on every finger -- a look Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele endorses -- feels a little decadent for everyday. But most guys can pull off a wedding ring on one hand and a ring or two on the other. A measured approach of trial and error works best -- don't go full Lagerfeld from the get-go. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  4. I don't own any jewelry -- but I'd like to. What should I buy first? </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  A pendant necklace low-profile enough to slip under a shirt (like this David Yurman number) is a foolproof starter, said stylist and consultant Will Kahn. Even when you're shirtless -- at the gym, at the beach, in the bedroom -- wearing a necklace \"shows a heightened [sense of] style,\" said Mr. Kahn. If necklaces aren't your jam, consider starting with a subtle, silver bracelet, which will blend with most any look, or a quietly luxurious ring, like this tiger's-eye option. 1.

Where should I shop? </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  That depends on what you're looking for -- and your level of expertise. Here, four options. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Department stores: Larger department stores -- such as Neiman Marcus in America, Selfridges in the U.K., and Isetan in Japan -- are jewelry smorgasbords with the widest array of brands, styles and prices. If, say, you want a basic bracelet but aren't sure which brand or even material to look at, department stores with IRL salespeople are the way to go. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Jewelry stores: Monobrand stores like Cartier and independent retailers like those in Manhattan's Diamond District (as featured in \"Uncut Gems\") will have a more limited assortment than department stores but tend to excel in precious stones and higher-ticket metals. If you already have an idea of what you like, head to one of these. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Auction houses: Two types of shoppers should consider auctions: those who want something vintage no one else will have, and those who are looking for deals. Don't expect bargains at Sotheby's or Christie's, but you can buy modern pieces at estate sales for a fraction of the retail price, said Claibourne Poindexter, associate jewelry specialist at Christie's. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Online: Don't want to leave the house? Focus on online retailers like Ssense, Farfetch and MatchesFashion.com, which carry designs from brands around the world. But this is not for novices: Trying on an unfamiliar style of bracelet or ring \"through\" your computer screen can be challenging. Know what you like and your size. If in doubt, contact customer service to ask questions. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  6. I got a pandemic piercing. OK, fine. I got two. Can I wear my jazzy new earrings to work or will I look like a pirate? </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Does an overloaded lobe a la Blackbeard align with the professional image you want to project? If you're Johnny Depp, seen here at the 2020 Berlin International Film Festival apparently reprising his Captain Jack Sparrow role, maybe. If not, dial it down. \"I don't think a drop earring is . . . necessarily office appropriate,\" said Mr. Kahn. When in doubt, opt for something simple, like a thin silver hoop that hugs the lobe. It's more elegant, less ahoy! </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  7. Do my jewelry, watch, belt buckle, etc. all need to be the same color metal? Or can I mix gold and silver? </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Traditional rules like never mixing silver and gold have gone out the window. Not only is mixing silver and gold cool, said Ms. Neidich, but so is blending white-, yellow- and rose-gold pieces. \"How you put your jewelry together communicates who you are,\" said Ms. Neidich. And nobody wants to communicate that they're the uptight matchy-matchy guy. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  8. I want a versatile chain necklace that I can wear all day, every day -- even at my corporate office. What are my options? </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Mr. Goldman, who has styled such prolific chain-wearers as musician Adam Levine, suggests a 24\" chain. It's \"a little easier, a little more everyday\" than short styles, he said. If you want to wear your chain inside your collar or tuck it into your tee, a 24-incher is more likely to stay put than its 18\" cousin, which hits just above the collar bone. </p><p>\n  Shape is personal preference: Box, rope, curb and braid chains are all acceptable. \"Just make sure it's something you love because then you'll wear it every day,\" said Mr. Goldman. As for the girth, the thicker you go, the better it will look worn outside your shirt. If you want to show off your chain like Drake here, go 5 mm or wider. If you're discreet, stick with subtle chains under 4 mm in width. </p><p>\n  --- </p><p>\n  9. After months of WFH, I feel like we, as a society, are sweatpants people now. Does that mean cuff links and tie bars are things of the past? </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  According to a report from market research firm Technavio, the cuff-links market is on track to grow 5.93% annually through 2025. London financier-turned-jeweler Robert Tateossian reports that his brand's cuff-link sales haven't dropped during Covid. Maybe wearing them as part of your daily work uniform has gone by the wayside, but people are more than ever itching to dress up, he said. \"Mad Men\"-style tie bars, however, largely fizzled around the same time as that show's finale, though Mr. Tateossian reports that they're still strong sellers in Japan.

Should I do that? </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  There comes a time in every man's life when he wants to be more like Brad. But the Oscar winner is barely pulling this hodgepodge look off, so no. Pick a different midlife crisis. </p><p>\n  (See accompanying photos -- WSJ Feb. 5, 2022) </p><p></p>",
