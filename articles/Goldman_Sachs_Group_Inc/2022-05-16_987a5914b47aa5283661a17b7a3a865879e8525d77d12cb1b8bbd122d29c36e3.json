  "text": "<p>Hey Fintech Fam,</p> <p>Fintech valuations will be particularly interesting to watch in the coming months as investors attempt to reconcile rapid growth with a deteriorating economic outlook. Both the financial and technology sectors have experienced a broad and steep sell off this year as investors worry about rising credit losses and higher interest rates. Publicly traded fintech companies have been hit particularly hard.</p> <p>Take Affirm for example: Last week the “buy now, pay later” business said it planned to be profitable on an operating basis by next July — sooner than Wall Street analysts expected. But rather than taking a victory lap, management spent most of the earnings call trying to reassure investors that it could survive. </p> <p>The online lender has been bombarded with questions about how its loan portfolio will perform in a downturn. “There's a fair debate to be had about maybe some players, but the debate is, frankly, wrong when it comes to Affirm,” chief financial officer Michael Linford told me.</p> <p>However, most sell-side analysts remain bullish that it will take “several quarters” for the broader market to get on board, Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette wrote in a note.</p> <p>Also we have some exciting news to share: In collaboration with S&amp;P intelligence, FintechFT will be bringing you an exclusive first look at the latest fundraising and deal trends in the fintech sector twice a month starting today.

The&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2929aef3-2caf-4530-8672-9c057ae72c21\">Nasdaq-listed firm</a>&#xa0;launched in India to great fanfare early last month, using India's impressive digital payments platform Unified Payments Interface (UPI) to help customers buy crypto.</p> <p>But as chief executive Brian Armstrong told analysts last week, the UPI party was over almost as soon as it began.</p> <p>“A few days after launching we ended up disabling UPI because of informal pressure from the Reserve Bank of India,” Armstrong said. </p> <p>Prior to the failed UPI launch Armstrong warned that entering the Indian market was “not going to be a straight shot”. Still, the company says it has invested $150mn in Indian crypto start-ups and is expanding its staff in the country from 300 to 1,000.</p> <p>“India is a unique market in that the Supreme Court has ruled that they can't ban crypto, but there are elements in the government there, including in the Reserve Bank of India, that don't seem to be as positive on it,” he said.</p> <p>A chief executive accusing a country's central bank and banking regulator of applying behind the scenes pressure to roll back a product? Only in crypto. But, as Armstrong acknowledged, India's relationship with crypto is complicated.</p> <p>Plans for an outright ban have rattled around India's legislature for years, and the RBI in 2018 even forbade banks from providing services to firms dealing in crypto. But a Supreme Court ruling two years later squashed the RBI's ban. For many crypto aficionados, this victory was seen as the legitimisation they needed to go all in — digital coins were still in a legal grey area, but the Supreme Court seemed to have backed them.</p> <p>Then earlier this year, more good news — the finance ministry said it was backing a central bank digital coin and would be imposing a steep tax on crypto transactions. For serious crypto proponents, this came as a painful but largely positive development: if the government can tax us that means crypto is legal now. Right?</p> <p>Well . . . just three days after Coinbase connected its crypto exchange to India's UPI, considered a gateway for hundreds of millions more potential crypto customers, it discovered it had a problem.</p> <p>The National Payments Corporation of India, the umbrella body for India's retail payments and settlement systems, said it was “not aware of any crypto exchange using” the UPI platform. The NCPI is linked to the RBI. Coinbase pulled the plug.</p> <p>Although crypto isn't strictly illegal, India's central bank governor Shaktikanta Das has said: “Private cryptocurrencies are a big threat to our financial and macroeconomic stability.” He insisted at a press conference earlier this year that cryptos would even undermine the RBI's ability to maintain financial stability.</p> <p>The RBI may have been beaten by the Supreme Court, but it's not about to stand by as crypto wallets snap open across the nation. (<em>Chloe Cornish</em>)</p> <h1>Fintech fascination</h1> <p><strong>Unstable Coins </strong>Tether sent shockwaves through the crypto market&#xa0;last week when it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5887ef43-d43a-4608-a1ac-aacc99f076b9\">failed to maintain its link to the dollar</a> days after its smaller rival TerraUSD failed. The peg was quickly fixed, but the snafu raised new concerns about the risks of stablecoins, which are meant to provide a safe place for traders in between bets on more volatile tokens.</p> <p><strong>Wall Street sets the stage for crypto future</strong> FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, one of crypto's most influential CEOs, told the FT that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02cad9b8-e2eb-43d4-8c18-2e9d34b443fe\">Bitcoin has no future</a> as a payments network. But Wall Street banks are laying the groundwork for digital assets to play a larger part of the investment industry. Citigroup, BNY Mellon and Wells Fargo joined a funding round for Talos, a US developer of cryptocurrency trading technology. Goldman Sachs and Barclays have invested in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e44ca65-1085-4429-b82a-5a6912ec1e65\">Elwood Technologies</a>, the cryptocurrency trading platform founded by British hedge fund billionaire Alan Howard, and&#xa0;Nomura is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04f5fb11-f635-45b0-a067-96756e01af19\">launching a new company</a> to help institutional clients invest into crypto.</p> <p><strong>VCs wade deeper into the art world</strong> Two of the largest cryptocurrency venture fund managers, Andreessen Horowitz and Paradigm have begun <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de268ae5-8ee2-472e-a49b-243e63e7ef5c\">investing directly in NFTs</a>, highlighting growing interest in the collectables among professional investors. The trend will pit fund managers against <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4bff48e3-9059-4262-9bf3-e6dae10d0b1e\">traditional art collectors</a>, who have also embraced digital assets.</p> <h1>Deal Tracker</h1> <p>The total value of fintech mergers and acquisitions announced in April fell 58 per cent to $870mn compared with over $2bn in the same period last year. The total number of deals dropped 13 per cent from 40 to 35, according to S&amp;P analysis. </p> <h1>Quick Fire Q&amp;A</h1> <p>I recently had coffee with Pushkar Mukewar, CEO and co-founder of Drip Capital, a Palo Alto-based company doing “buy now, pay later” for small and medium-sized business, aka trade finance. Though the concept of BNPL has long existed in the B2B space, Mukewar says his company automates underwriting for transactions historically too small for larger banks to care about.</p> <p><strong>How did you get started? </strong>When we look at trade finance as an industry, SMBs have been largely ignored&#xa0;historically.&#xa0;The industry is being dominated by old-aged banks like the HSBCs and Citibanks of the world, which have highly paper-based, manual processes. The industry hasn't seen much innovation for decades. And most of these banks have historically focused on the corporate segment of the market. It's just not worth their while to target a SMB because the economics of their transaction at that point don't make sense. In the SMB segment, they will only do collateral-backed financing.</p> <p><strong>What do you offer?</strong> We have two main products: the accelerated payments solution which is focused on exporters and we launched the BNPL solution for US based importers. We are predominantly targeting emerging market exporters. We started off in India back in 2016-17. And then because the idea was always to build a global platform, we also launched in Mexico in 2018. These two geographies are the predominant focus areas for us on the exporter solution. In 2020, through the pandemic, we started also seeing a very strong demand for a BNPL solution from importers and hence, we launched that. What we do on the US front is the fastest growing business. In the last 18 months, it's scaled up from nothing to almost 20 per cent of the overall business.</p> <p><strong>How much have you raised so far? </strong>In terms of equity, we've raised about $86mn so far. And our major investors are Accel partners, Sequoia Capital, Y Combinator and Wing VC . . . On the funding capital side or debt side, we work with two major banks at the moment and a number of family offices and credit funds. Our biggest partner is Barclays. And the other institutional partner is East West Bank. On the funding capital side, we raised over $500mn.</p> <p><strong>What is investor appetite for this kind of debt? </strong>We have seen a lot of interest from institutional investors and family offices looking at exposure to this asset class. We focus on SMBs in emerging markets that are credit starved, and channel capital from developed markets like the US where every investor is looking for yield. We've been able to prove that this is actually a very, very high performing asset class because the yields are high with very low losses, given the short duration nature of the asset class. And I think historically the problem has been many people have not been able to originate this asset class at scale.</p> <p><strong>What's the revenue model? </strong>We make money off every transaction that gets processed on the platform. There's a flat fee per transaction and then there's also an interest rate component, which depends on the duration of the transaction and the timeframe.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/2fa20459-d432-4b5f-8cc4-e6ba02413cb0.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Imani Moise 2022 'Inside India's complex relationship with crypto' FT.com 16 May.
