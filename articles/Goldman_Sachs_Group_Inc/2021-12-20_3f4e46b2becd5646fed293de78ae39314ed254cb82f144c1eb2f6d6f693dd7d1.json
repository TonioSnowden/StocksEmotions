Joe Manchin's assertion that he won't back President Joe Biden's key $2 trillion spending bill. Manchin&#xa0;told Fox News Sunday&#xa0;that, after&#xa0;five-and-a-half months of talks within his own party, he couldn't “vote to continue with this piece of legislation. I just can't. I've tried everything humanly possible. I can't get there.” His vote is crucial in a 50-50 split Senate.</p><p>Despite the challenges that the economy may face in this wave of infections, central bankers are expected to be more aggressive about lifting interest rates, which currently stand at a range between 0% and 0.25%, to combat inflation that has been rising on the back of supply-chain bottlenecks and growing demand for goods and services in the uneven economic recovery from the pandemic.</p><p>Against that backdrop, February gold GCG22&#xa0;was trading $7.90, or 0.4%, to reach $1,797 an ounce, following a 1.1% decline for the most-active contract.</p><p>Meanwhile, March silver SIH22 was trading 24 cents, or 1.1%, lower to reach $22.29 an ounce, after gold's sister metal put in a 1.5% weekly gain on Friday.</p><p>A number of countries have already imposed fresh restrictions due to the spread of the omicron variant of coronavirus that causes COVID-19 as the holiday season gets under fuller swing. The Netherlands on Sunday reimposed a lockdown, with all nonessential shops, bars and restaurants closed until mid-January. Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin also announced new restrictions, and President Biden is expected to deliver a Tuesday update on the fight against COVID-19, The Wall Street Journal reported.</p>",
