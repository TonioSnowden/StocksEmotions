  "text": "<p>Top News</p><p>Barkin Says More Data Is Needed Before Raising Rates</p><p>Richmond Fed leader Thomas Barkin said that the U.S. central bank needs more data before it can make the call on when it is time to raise its short-term rate target. \"If the need is there, we'll do what we have to do,\" Mr. Barkin said in a Yahoo Finance video interview. \"But, I personally think it's very helpful for us to have a few more months to evaluate, is inflation going to come back to more normal levels? Is the labor market going to open up?\"</p><p>Former New York Fed Chief Sees More Hawkish Fed Rate Rise Path</p><p>Former New York Fed leader William Dudley, who retired in 2018, believes the Fed will have to raise its short-term target rate range from near zero to between 3% and 4%, he said in a Bloomberg television appearance. Mr. Dudley said he believes the Fed will start raising rates by June and \"they're going to go faster than what people think and to a higher rate peak than what people think.\" (Dow Jones Newswires)</p><p>U.S. Economy</p><p>In Inflation Denial? You're Not Alone</p><p>Americans are paying higher prices for groceries, gas and holiday gifts, yet many are living and spending as if it isn't happening. As prices rise at a pace not seen since the 1990s, many haven't experienced the havoc that inflation can cause on their wallets. Some are so far failing to reconcile the reality of price increases with the lifestyle changes required to adapt.</p><p>Tyson Foods Raises Meat Prices as Costs Escalate</p><p>Biden Signs $1 Trillion Infrastructure Bill Into Law</p><p>President Biden signed into law a roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill to repair the nation's aging roads and bridges, upgrade the electrical grid and expand access to broadband internet.</p><p>What's in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill?</p><p>Key Developments Around the World</p><p>RBA Governor Expects Perfect Inflationary Storm to Moderate</p><p>Reserve Bank of Australia Gov. Philip Lowe said he expects the current perfect storm of inflationary forces to moderate over the next 18 months, and that the central bank will only raise interest rates when it is confident that inflation won't slip again.</p><p>Mr. Lowe also said that Australian regulators may have to further tighten mortgage serviceability standards if growth in household debt continues to outpace wages growth. \"We're building up medium-term risk in a world where household debt is increasing at 10% per year and incomes are growing at 4 or 5 [percent]. That's problematic,\" Mr. Lowe said.</p><p>Bank of England's Bailey Signals Inflation Unease</p><p>Bank of England Gov. Andrew Bailey signaled that the central bank was poised to raise interest rates to contain inflation, telling U.K. lawmakers he was \"very uneasy\" about rising inflation and that the central bank's decision to leave rates on hold earlier in November was a close call. \"After this, many will be expecting the interest rates to go up in December,\" Spreadex analyst Oliver Males said. (Dow Jones Newswires)</p><p>Bank of Canada to Adjust if It's Wrong on Inflation, Macklem Says</p><p>Bank of Canada Gov. Tiff Macklem said the central bank has the flexibility to adjust its monetary policy if it winds up being wrong about how long inflationary pressures are going to last.</p><p>Mr. Macklem made the comments in an opinion piece published in the Financial Times. He said the bank continues to see drivers of high inflation—such as supply-chain disruptions and energy-price increases—as temporary, although he added policy makers have taken those pressures into account in considering the dynamics of supply and demand. \"If we end up being wrong about the persistence of inflationary pressures and how much slack remains in the economy, we will adjust,\" he said.

Over the past year, judges have ruled in favor of insurers in hundreds of cases, backing up the carriers' rejections of \"business interruption\" insurance claims. Many of those rulings have involved policies with virus-specific exclusions, which can make the cases more open-and-shut for judges.</p><p>Forward Guidance</p><p>Tuesday (all times ET)</p><p>8:30 a.m.: U.S. Commerce Department releases October retail sales</p><p>9:15 a.m.: Federal Reserve releases October U.S. industrial production</p><p>11:10 a.m.: European Central Bank's Lagarde speaks in on-stage interview</p><p>12 p.m.: Atlanta Fed's Bostic, Kansas City Fed's George, Minneapolis Fed's Kashkari and Richmond Fed's Barkin speak at virtual event on racism and the economy hosted by regional Fed banks; Bank of Canada's Schembri speaks on labor market and monetary policy to Canadian Association for Business Economics</p><p>12:30 p.m.: San Francisco Fed's Daly speaks on monetary policy to Commonwealth Club</p><p>2:55 p.m.: Philadelphia Fed's Harker speaks at fintech conference held by his bank</p><p>8:20 p.m.: European Central Bank's Lagarde gives video message on women in fundamental science at Friends of IHES event</p><p>Wednesday</p><p>4 a.m.: European Central Bank publishes financial stability review</p><p>8:30 a.m.: U.S. Commerce Department releases October housing starts</p><p>9 a.m.: European Central Bank's Schnabel speaks on euro area economic and monetary policy outlook at event hosted by Goldman Sachs</p><p>9:10 a.m.: New York Fed's Williams speaks at U.S. Treasury Market Conference</p><p>12:40 p.m.: Cleveland Fed's Mester gives opening remarks at financial stability conference organized by Cleveland Fed and Office of Financial Research; Fed's Waller speaks on stablecoins at financial stability conference organized by Cleveland Fed and Office of Financial Research; San Francisco Fed's Daly speaks with Commodities Futures Trading Commission acting chair at U.S. Treasury Market Conference</p><p>4:05 p.m.: Chicago Fed's Evans speaks on economy and monetary policy at Mid-Size Bank Coalition of America event</p><p>4:10 p.m.: Atlanta Fed's Bostic speaks on assistance for vulnerable renters at Fed community development research seminar</p><p>Research</p><p>JPMorgan Says Households to Navigate Inflation Using Savings</p><p>Consumers will likely deal with surging inflation pressures by eating into savings, says a new report from JPMorgan. \"The acceleration in global inflation is now intensifying while inflationary pressure is also broadening,\" the bank said in a report Monday, adding that \"the broadening aligns with our forecast that recovery dynamics are broadly based.\" To get through this, \"U.S. households will have to eat into their accumulated excess savings to offset rising prices. Our analysis suggests this is likely when labor markets are strengthening and we look for a significant fall in the household saving rate this quarter,\" the report said.</p><p>Commentary</p><p>Market Bets on a Fed Interest-Rate Mistake</p><p>The market is saying that the Federal Reserve is going to be raising rates sooner and faster than the central bank itself thinks it will. But the market is also saying that rates won't go as high as the Fed eventually thinks they will, writes Justin Lahart. The market might be smarter than any one forecaster or the Federal Reserve when it comes to where rates are going. Unfortunately, it isn't easy figuring out what the market is trying to say.</p><p>China's Growth Hasn't Bottomed Yet</p><p>It is a small irony that, even as negotiators were returning home from the Glasgow climate summit, data released Monday showed a small bump in China's industrial growth—largely due to mining and power sector activity.</p><p>The good news, from a growth perspective at least, is that power curbs probably no longer present much of a threat to Chinese manufacturing writ large, writes Nathaniel Taplin. The bad news is that domestic demand still looks very weak. Growth will probably decelerate further for the remainder of 2021 and into early 2022.</p><p>Basis Points</p><p>Rebounding economic activity and natural gas shortages recently pushed the developed world's oil reserves to their lowest since early 2015, but growing crude supply could soon ease that pressure, the International Energy Agency said Tuesday.</p><p>The eurozone economy expanded at a strong pace in the third quarter, almost fully recovering the gap from the Covid-19 induced recession, but growth is expected to slow sharply in the months ahead as the boost from the reopening fades.</p><p>The number of people on company payrolls in the U.K. continued to increase in October, a sign that the end of a government wage-subsidy program didn't push up joblessness.</p><p>New York's manufacturing activity gained momentum in November on strong demand and strong job creation, according to a survey from the New York Fed. The Empire State Manufacturing Survey's general business conditions index rose to 30.9 in November from 19.8 in October. In November, 43% of the firms polled in the survey said conditions had improved compared with October, while 12% reported that business worsened. Labor market indicators signaled strong job creation.
