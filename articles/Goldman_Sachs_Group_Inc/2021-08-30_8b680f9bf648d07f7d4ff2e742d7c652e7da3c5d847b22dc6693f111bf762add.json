Health care has also made a good third-quarter showing, while performing much better for 2021.

The prolonged low-interest-rate environment may help explain the higher valuation for the utilities sector, which is associated with attractive dividend yields.</p><p>Then again, the stock listed below with the second-highest dividend yield is Merck &amp; Co.
