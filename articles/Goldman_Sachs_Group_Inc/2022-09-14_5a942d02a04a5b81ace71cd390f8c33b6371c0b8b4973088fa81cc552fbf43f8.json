  "title": "Bank Regulator Appoints Chen  Its Chief Climate-Risk Officer  ----  By Richard Vanderford",
  "text": "<p>   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has appointed Yue (Nina) Chen, a risk expert with experience at New York's financial regulator and at major banks, as its chief climate-risk officer. </p><p>   The banking regulator on Monday announced the appointment of Dr. Chen, who trained as a chemical engineer, to lead the OCC's climate-risk effort. She will report directly to Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu, the OCC said. </p><p>   Dr. Chen succeeds Jonathan Fink, who assumed the climate duties in an acting capacity in March while also serving as a senior adviser to Mr. Hsu. </p><p>   The OCC under Mr. Hsu has urged the financial services industry to manage the risks posed by climate change, and in December released draft guidance that included principles on how large banks should address climate-related risk in their governance, policies and strategies. </p><p>   Previously, Dr. Chen worked at the New York State Department of Financial Services as a climate-risk expert and in November was tapped to head its newly created climate division. </p><p>   \"Dr. Chen is a tremendous talent and her contributions to DFS, leading our first-in-the-nation climate division, were vast and always appreciated,\" the regulator said in a statement. </p><p>   Dr. Chen also served as vice chairwoman of the climate risk steering group of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, a Switzerland-based organization of insurance regulators that sets global standards for the sector. Before her time at DFS, she served as director of conservation investments at the Nature Conservancy, an environmental group, and held positions at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank of Canada. </p><p></p>",
