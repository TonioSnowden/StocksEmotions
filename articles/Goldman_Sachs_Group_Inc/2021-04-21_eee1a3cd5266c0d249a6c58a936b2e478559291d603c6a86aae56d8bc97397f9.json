  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Ex-Analyst  Is Barred  For Insider  Trading  ----  By Allison Prang",
  "text": "<p>   A Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. analyst has been barred from the broker-dealer industry by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for insider trading, the regulator said Tuesday. </p><p>   Brian Maguire, formerly an analyst at Goldman, bought shares in two different companies -- once last April and once last June -- after finding out through internal emails that another analyst was upgrading his recommendation on those firms to \"buy\" from \"neutral,\" Finra said. </p><p>   In April, Mr. Maguire bought 2,000 shares of one company for around $128,000. In June, he bought 29,000 shares of another company for nearly $722,000. </p><p>   The stock upgrades had been approved internally at the time Mr. Maguire bought his shares but he did so ahead of publication of the upgrades, Finra said. </p><p>   The regulator didn't disclose the companies in question. </p><p>   Finra, Wall Street's regulatory organization, also said that Mr. Maguire traded securities of issuers that he covered and sold issuers' securities when he rated them as a \"buy\" in his research. </p><p>   He also wrote research reports and didn't disclose that a household member had a financial interest in the issuers' securities, which is against Finra regulations, the regulator said. </p><p>   Mr. Maguire also lied to the regulator regarding his trading during testimony, Finra said. </p><p>   Goldman fired Mr. Maguire in November. He had started working at the company in 2010. </p><p>   In settling the matter, Mr. Maguire didn't admit or deny the charges, the regulator said. He did allow Finra to enter its findings, it said. </p><p>   A representative for Mr. Maguire didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   \"The former employee in question violated a firm policy and we terminated his employment,\" Goldman said in an emailed statement. \"We have a zero-tolerance policy for behavior of this sort and have cooperated with the proper authorities.\" </p><p></p>",
