  "title": "U.S. Home Sales Fell Again in June, Economists Estimate; The housing market and construction have cooled as higher interest rates start to bite",
  "text": "<p>Home sales have fallen off as buyers contend with high prices and rising mortgage rates, which pushes up monthly payments. The National Association of Realtors will release June sales figures at 10 a.m. ET.</p><p>The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 5.51% in the week ended Thursday, up from 2.88% from a year earlier, according to housing-finance agency Freddie Mac.</p><p>\"Buyers can't figure out what is the right price,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"Sellers are very reluctant to give up\" on the price they expected to sell for a few months ago, he said.</p><p>But demand still exceeds supply, keeping prices elevated. The median existing-home price rose 14.8% in May from a year earlier to $407,600, a record high in data going back to 1999, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p><p>Higher mortgage costs are in part a result of the Federal Reserve's aggressive path of interest rate increases in an effort to tame inflation, which hit 9.1% in June, the highest in more than four decades. Fed officials moved up rates by three quarters of a percentage point in June, the largest increase since 1994. Officials will likely make a similar move at their meeting next week.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Have you bought or sold a home recently? What is the real-estate market like in your area? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Tighter Fed policy has pushed up borrowing costs across the board, particularly for mortgages. Last month, mortgage rates hit their highest point since 2008, before falling down slightly.</p><p>Almost 15% of home-purchase agreements that were pending in June fell through, the highest level since April 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic disrupted the market, according to real-estate brokerage Redfin Corp.</p><p>\"We have a lot of people that are just sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what happens with interest rates and the overall economy,\" said Phil Mount, a real-estate agent in Boise, Idaho. \"People aren't buying right now because they're nervous.\"</p><p>Higher interest rates and cooling sales have also weighed on home builders and depressed new construction.</p><p>Housing starts fell 2% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.56 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, the second consecutive decline. Residential permits, which can be a bellwether for future home construction, fell 0.6% in June from the prior month.</p><p>Builders are now focused on selling the homes they have already completed rather than building more, analysts said.</p><p>An index of builder confidence has fallen for seven straight months and in July stood at the lowest level since May 2020, the National Association of Home Builders said Monday.</p><p>Tuesday's data on housing starts prompted several forecasters to downgrade their estimates for second-quarter economic growth. Economists at Goldman Sachs lowered their forecast by 0.1 percentage point to 0.6%. Barclays economists now project a 0.7% growth rate in the second quarter, down from 0.8%.</p><p>In response to rising rates, some buyers are opting for adjustable-rate mortgages, which offer a lower interest rate in the early years of the loan, or are paying more up front to reduce their interest rates.</p><p>Eddie Doyle, 26 years old, used an adjustable-rate mortgage when he bought his first house in Fort Dodge, Iowa, for $167,500 in June. His mortgage carries a 3.625% interest rate for the first 10 years.</p><p>\"I paid a little more for the house than I wanted to,\" Mr. Doyle said. But \"in this townâ€¦if it's reasonably priced, it's not sitting on the market for longer than a week.\"</p><p>News Corp, owner of the Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from NAR.</p><p>Write to Nicole Friedman at nicole.friedman@wsj.com and David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Home Sales Fell Again in June, Economists Estimate</p>",
