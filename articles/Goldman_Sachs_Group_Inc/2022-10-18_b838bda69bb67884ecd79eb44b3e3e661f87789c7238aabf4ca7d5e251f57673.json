  "title": "China's Economic Data Gets Harder to Find as Growth Slows; Getting a clear picture of the country's economic woes has grown more challenging as official figures and private analysis vanish",
  "text": "<p>The moves, which economists said had no obvious precedent in China, came as China holds a Communist Party congress where leader Xi Jinping is expected to secure a third term. They were only the most glaring examples of what many investors and scholars say reflects increasing sensitivities around economic data and commentary that have made analysis of the world's second-largest economy more difficult.</p><p>In the past year, China's official statistics bureau and private research firms have retracted or removed more data from public access, while reports by economists and market analysts—particularly those with a more bearish outlook—have been retracted or expunged. Some prominent analysts who have questioned economic policy have had their social-media accounts suspended.</p><p>And, in recent weeks, China's securities regulator has urged brokerage firms, including the domestic Chinese businesses of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., to refrain from commenting ahead of the Communist Party conclave on politically sensitive topics, which could include a range of subjects, including many aspects of the economy.</p><p>\"For investors, there is a lot of guesswork involved now,\" says Hao Hong, a prominent Hong Kong-based market strategist who left Chinese state-owned Bocom International Holdings Co. and had his Chinese social-media accounts suspended in May after he offered a bearish take on China's economy and stock market outlook. The bank said at the time that he left for personal reasons. Mr. Hong declined to comment on his departure.</p><p>\"The environment will only become tighter,\" said Mr. Hong, who is now chief economist for Grow Investment Group, an investment firm based in Shanghai. \"You have no choice but to adapt.\"</p><p>The integrity of economic data in China has long been a question mark for investors and economists. Official figures offer limited transparency into the labor market and the amount of local governments' off-balance sheet debt, for example.</p><p>China's data-security law adopted last year has made it harder for foreign companies and investors to get information about Chinese-based firms. Hedge funds and other investors have turned to private data suppliers, satellite imagery and other increasingly obscure alternative data sources in hopes of getting a better grasp of the economic situation.</p><p>But concerns about access to accurate economic indicators and independent analysis have only grown as the slowdown has deepened in the run-up to this week's Communist Party congress. Much of the data highlights weaknesses in the Chinese economy, which has suffered from a slump in the property sector and Covid-19 policies that have stifled consumer spending and investment. Mr. Xi is, meanwhile, trying to insulate the country's economy from geopolitical turbulence and present China's approach as superior to Western models of governance.</p><p>\"Investors tend to examine official data more closely during economic downturns,\" said Bruce Pang, chief China economist at Jones Lang LaSalle. \"Officials will likely put more emphasis on how they present the data to help manage sentiment.\"</p><p>The Chinese monthly export data that had originally been slated for release last week was expected to have shown export growth, which had supported China's initial postpandemic recovery, slowing to its lowest rate in five months, according to The Wall Street Journal's poll of economists.</p><p>Similarly, data originally scheduled for Tuesday was expected to show that GDP growth slowed. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal forecast it grew 3.5% in the third quarter compared with a year earlier, making hitting the official growth target for the year of around 5.5% even less likely.</p><p>One area of intense focus for economists and investors is China's housing sector, which has come under intense strain since Beijing began enforcing strict limits on property developer debt, pushing many to default and eventually hitting home buyer sentiment as projects went unfinished and sales slowed.</p><p>In August, Beijing-based Beike Research Institute, which regularly publishes reports on China's real-estate market, pegged the average residential vacancy rate in 28 Chinese cities at 12.1%. Though the level was far lower than in earlier scholarly estimates, Beike described the vacancy rate in its report as being \"relatively high,\" exceeding that of the U.S. and U.K.</p><p>Within days, Beike retracted the report and apologized for what it called an \"incomprehensive\" survey that had employed \"nonstandardized\" sampling methods. A representative of Beike, a subsidiary of New York-listed KE Holdings Inc., declined to comment.</p><p>Data pointing to relatively high vacancy rates could exacerbate \"already weak sentiment among home buyers, and create a negative loop,\" said Zhennan Li, chief China economist at AllianceBernstein.</p><p>Trying to offer economic commentary around China's zero-tolerance pandemic-containment policies, which have been credited with reducing the number of Covid-related deaths but have also battered the economy for nearly three years now, has also been perilous.</p><p>Huatai Securities, a brokerage firm based in Nanjing, published a report last month suggesting that the Covid-19 pandemic had become less deadly as different viral variants arose and may be less dangerous than influenza, suggesting that Beijing could loosen its policy, according to screenshots viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Days later, it removed the report from its website and social-media accounts. Huatai didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>As pandemic-induced lockdowns spread across China in recent years, hitting factory production and crippling supply chains, some investors and economists turned to G7 Connect Inc., a Chinese startup backed by technology giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. that tracks truck traffic across the country.</p><p>But G7 Connect stopped publishing road freight publicly on its website in December. The data is now only accessible to \"government and domestic partners,\" a company representative wrote in response to questions, saying the data was removed in part because of \"security concerns.\"</p><p>Michael Hirson, head of China research at New York-based 22V Research, said when there is a lack of information, \"global markets might expect the worst, even if the underlying situation may not be that bad. Those ripple effects can play out really quickly.\" Mr. Hirson is among those who have found data and information on China increasingly inaccessible.</p><p>Some worry that economists and investment banks in China are holding off on offering more downbeat assessments of the economy, for fear of running afoul of authorities—even after a string of GDP forecast cuts in recent months.</p><p>That means more aggressive downgrades may still be in the offing, especially for next year, creating more uncertainty for investors, said Logan Wright, director of China markets research at New York-based Rhodium Group.</p><p>At the height of the initial outbreak in April 2020, Li Xunlei, chief economist at Chinese brokerage firm Zhongtai Securities, wrote on his social-media account that the country's overall jobless rate, taking migrant workers and other factors into account, could be as high as 20.5%. In contrast, China's official headline measure of joblessness—the surveyed urban unemployment rate—was at about 5.9%.</p><p>The post was deleted that day. Four days later, Mr. Li published a statement playing down his analysis and said that he had deleted the report in part to \"avoid misinterpretation by certain media.\"</p><p>\"Please refer to the official figures,\" he wrote at the time. Mr. Li didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Write to Stella Yifan Xie at stella.xie@wsj.com</p><p>China's Economic Data Gets Harder to Find as Growth Slows</p>",
