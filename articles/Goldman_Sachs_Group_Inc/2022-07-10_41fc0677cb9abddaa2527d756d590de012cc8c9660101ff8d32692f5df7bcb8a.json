  "text": "<p>With the price of everything from beans to medicines soaring, retiree Philomena Amara has little doubt about who is to blame: the ruling Bharatiya Janata party of India's prime minister Narendra Modi.</p> <p>“They are minting money, only thinking of themselves,” the 70-year-old fumed as she scoured a Mumbai market for the cheapest options. </p> <p>India's poor were already the worst affected by the country's stringent coronavirus pandemic lockdowns. Now, they are bearing the brunt of rising <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/0c11b954-798b-4d35-a369-6d5508fe4f2b\">food costs</a>, as Russia's war on Ukraine triggers steep gains in commodity prices around the world. </p> <p>For the Modi government, the stakes could not be higher. Controlling inflation is crucial in a country in which the price of onions can reputedly decide elections, as it did in 1980 when former prime minister Indira Gandhi was victorious after her rival oversaw a steep increase in the cost of the vegetable. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/indian-economy\">India</a>'s headline inflation hit an eight-year high in April of 7.79 per cent against a year earlier, before moderating slightly in May to 7.04 per cent. But it remains above the upper end of the central bank's target range of 6 per cent and vegetable costs continued to soar in May, rising 18.26 per cent year on year.</p> <p>“We see upside risks from food inflation,” Goldman Sachs said in a research note.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10534804.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>In response, Modi's government has cut fuel taxes while the Reserve Bank of India has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e7847d4-2eb6-44c7-87cb-18bfd697e105\">begun raising interest rates</a> for the first time in nearly four years. But those efforts have come too late to prevent further price rises, analysts said. </p> <p>“I think the RBI was a little complacent and the government, too. The focus had just been on [economic] growth,” said Shumita Deveshwar, senior director for India research at TS Lombard. </p> <p>The rise in inflation has coincided with the withdrawal of pandemic-era central bank relief measures and a heatwave that has battered India's wheat crop. </p> <p>The RBI has trimmed its growth forecast for gross domestic product for the year ending March 2023 to 7.2 per cent, down from 7.8 per cent in February.</p> <p>In response to the rising food prices and crop damage, New Delhi <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6551bb35-1de8-4918-bc53-4064f2fd4968\">has limited wheat exports</a> and announced a cap on sugar shipments as well as cooking gas subsidies for low-income households.</p> <p>The government's excise duty cuts for petrol and diesel should directly ease inflation by 0.2 percentage points and indirectly by 0.5 percentage points, according to HSBC.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10534096.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>But the fiscal cost of the fuel tax cuts is steep — HSBC estimates Rs1tn ($13bn) in lost government revenues. New Delhi also said it would help farmers by doubling fertiliser subsidies, adding to the burden on government finances.</p> <p>Altogether, economists estimate that the new fiscal measures will cost the state Rs2tn — equivalent to at least 0.5 per cent of GDP. </p> <p>For the government, “it's definitely a tough balancing act now”, said Sonal Varma, Nomura chief economist for Asia except Japan. </p> <p>That comes on top of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman's budget in February, which aimed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0a6cf20-c4c0-43a0-a717-010167dbf1e7\">increase capital expenditure</a> by a third to about $100bn through spending on infrastructure.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10534155.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Sanjiv Bajaj, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, one of the country's biggest business associations, said the government and the RBI were approaching inflation in a “practical” way. “You don't want to kill the golden goose that lays the eggs, so they have to balance growth with inflation,” Bajaj said.</p> <p>But half of the respondents to a recent CII survey cited growing import costs as a concern after the rupee hit a series of record lows against the dollar this year.</p> <p>The biggest problems facing Indian industry were “inflation and international uncertainties”, Bajaj said.</p> <p>But support for the BJP has held up despite the history of extreme price sensitivity among voters, said Neerja Chowdhury, a political commentator in New Delhi.</p> <p>The ruling party's combination of Hindu nationalist rhetoric and a strong emphasis on welfare benefits had helped to buttress its popularity despite the economic shock of the pandemic. The BJP swept a series of state elections this year.<br><br>But she added: “There's a limit to people's tolerance. That's why [the government] cut down on petrol duties. Much depends on how they handle the situation.”</p> <p>There are signs that some voters, such as Amara, who is already cutting back on vegetable purchases, have had enough. They feel they have been abandoned by the government, a sentiment that is threatening to grow with the onset of the monsoon season, which even during times of low inflation typically leads to higher food prices. </p> <p>“This is all because of the politicians,” Amara said. “[They are not even] looking at the price hike.”</p><p>Source: Chloe Cornish and Andrea Rodrigues in Mumbai and Benjamin Parkin in New Delhi 2022 '‘This is all because of the politicians': rising prices anger Indians' FT.com 10 July.
