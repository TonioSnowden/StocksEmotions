Yields move in the opposite direction to prices.</p><p>* The yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was up at 3.534% versus 3.501% Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>* The yield on the 30-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD30Y advanced to 3.545% from 3.527% late Tuesday.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>On Wednesday, Fed policy makers raised their benchmark interest rate target by 50 basis points, to between 4.25% and 4.5%, and signaled more tightening is on the way in 2023. The median forecast for the fed-funds rate in 2023 rose to 5.1%, up from the 4.6% estimate made in September.</p><p>During a post-meeting press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that \"we have more work to do\" even after Wednesday's action and he stressed the need to restore price stability. Powell also echoed language in the Fed's statement by saying that policy makers continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the fed-funds rate target \"will be appropriate,\" and that the central bank will keep shrinking its balance sheet.</p><p>Fed-funds futures traders now see a 44% chance of a 50-basis-point rate hike at the Fed's February meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The chance of a 75 basis point hike in February was seen at 8%, while the likelihood of a 25-basis-point hike was seen at 47%.</p><p>Benchmark 10-year gilt yields BX:TMBMKGB-10Y rose 1.7 basis points to 3.313% afterU.K. inflationdipped to 10.7% in November from 11.1% in October. The Bank of England is expected to increase interest rates by 50 basis points, to 3.5%, after its Thursday meeting.</p><p>What analysts are saying</p><p>\"The Fed's more hawkish projections than what the market has been pricing for the terminal rate next year are consistent with the views we have previously articulated that the Fed will have to continue to raise interest rates to 5% or higher and keep them there to anchor inflation expectations close to their target of 2%,\" said Maria Vassalou, co-chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"The market's optimism about a lower terminal rate and cuts in the second half of next year have been working against the Fed and are unrealistic in our view, unless we see a financial crisis or drain of liquidity in the markets that will [require] the Fed to step in and lower rates. In all other cases, we expect the Fed to hike to above 5% and stay there,\" Vassalou wrote in an email.</p><p>Treasury yields turn mostly higher after Fed hikes rates by 50 basis points</p>",
