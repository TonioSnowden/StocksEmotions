  "text": "<p>If you think the political situation in the US now looks terrible, Adam Hochschild is here to remind you that things have previously been much worse. <em>American Midnight</em>, his new book about the US domestic scene in the years during and just after the first world war, describes a society that more patriotic histories generally gloss over.</p> <p>Riven with racial and ethnic prejudice, 1910s America was obsessed with suppressing union activism and political dissent by any means necessary. Hochschild describes vicious lynchings, mass arrests and systematic abuse of prisoners, all justified first by the exigencies of the great war and then fears of communist revolution.</p> <p>Best known for his 1998 book <em>King Leopold's Ghost</em>, which introduced many western readers to the horrors of Belgian rule in what is now Congo, Hochschild has developed something of a speciality in delving into dark periods of world history. He forces readers to confront the abuses and remember those who had the courage to fight against militarism and speak up for the powerless and dispossessed, from the British antislavery movement to antiwar activists in the first world war.</p> <p>Disturbed by&#xa0;“the toxic currents of racism, nativism and contempt for the rule of law” that have boiled up in contemporary politics, he focused this time on&#xa0;an era when workers, black Americans and free thinkers faced vicious reprisals for daring to question the unfair status quo.&#xa0;“By examining closely another period in which they engulfed the country, we can understand them more deeply and defend against them in the future,” he writes.</p> <p>Hochschild's villains are the politicians and bureaucrats who furthered their careers by persecuting leftists and exaggerating the threat they posed. Among the worst was Mitchell Palmer, who, as attorney general, presided over a series of warrantless arrests and show trials that purportedly targeted dangerous communists but swept in hundreds of illiterate immigrants. Ralph van Deman brought home military tactics used against independence fighters in the Philippines, including spying and waterboarding, and employed them against labour activists and political dissenters. Albert Johnson spearheaded racist legislation that closed America's doors to Asians and eastern Europeans for decades.</p> <p>Better known American figures also come off badly. Hochschild highlights the failings of Woodrow Wilson, who as president talked loftily of international freedom while spreading segregation and permitting a draconian crackdown on dissent at home. He vaguely questioned subordinates such as postmaster general Albert Burleson, who refused to deliver leftist publications, but did nothing to rein them in. Theodore Roosevelt, who was out of office and scheming to get back into power, is portrayed as a bigoted warmonger.</p> <p>Though much of the history is unrelentingly grim, Hochschild finds heroes who stood up against the tide of hatred and violence. Kindly and gentle Eugene Debs spearheaded union efforts and ran five times for president in the early 1900s as the nominee of the socialist party. In 1920, he garnered more than 900,000 votes, the most ever for an American socialist candidate, even though he was in prison for sedition because of his opposition to the war. Kate Richards O'Hare, known as “Red Kate”, was a mother of four who barnstormed the country throughout the decade, when she wasn't in jail, drawing thousands to hear her calls for a better, fairer society. And Emma Goldman, the anarchist writer who challenged traditional gender roles was eventually expelled from the country.</p> <p>These vivid portraits made me wish that Hochschild had spent more time explaining how Americans pulled themselves out of their swamp of violence and repression. He gives readers brief flashes of hope — for example, when Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes changed his mind and issued a ringing dissent defending the right to unpopular political opinions in Abrams v United States in 1919 and when Louis Post, who briefly served as acting Labor Secretary, in 1920 refused to allow mass deportations of alleged anarchists.</p> <p>But the ebbing of the anti-immigrant and anti-leftist tide is almost anticlimatic. Attorney General Palmer overplayed his hand with predictions of a mass communist uprising in May 1920 that failed to materialise, and public attention turned elsewhere.</p> <p>By 1921, Republican president Warren Harding, who is generally considered a political nonentity or worse, felt able to call a halt to the violent repression of socialism and let the movement's leaders go. Many of the rights and protections that they had been seeking were enacted into law in the 1930s as part of Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. One can only hope that today's reactionary politics will be followed by a similar progressive wave.</p> <p><em>Brooke Masters is the FT's US investment and industry editor</em></p> <p><strong>American Midnight: A Great War, a Violent Peace and Democracy's Forgotten Crisis </strong>by Adam Hochschild, <em>Mariner Books $29.99, 432 pages</em></p><p>Source: Brooke Masters 2022 'American Midnight — a dark and overlooked period of US history' FT.com 30 November.
