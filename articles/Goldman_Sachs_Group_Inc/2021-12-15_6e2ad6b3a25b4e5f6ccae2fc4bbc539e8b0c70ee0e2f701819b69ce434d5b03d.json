  "title": "Anchorage Capital Closing $7.4 Billion Flagship Hedge Fund; Letter to investors reports closing after 18 years",
  "text": "<p>Anchorage, which has roughly $30 billion of assets, said it would focus on its structured-credit and private-equity-style funds that call down capital from clients. They manage about $18 billion and $4 billion, respectively. Structured-finance vehicles—like collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs—have grown increasingly attractive to investors as interest rates have fallen in recent years because they yield more than traditional bonds with comparable credit ratings.</p><p>\"In this current market where indiscriminate access to capital, elevated equity market multiples, default rates near record lows, and central bank policies supportive of risk assets, we believe that the asset-liability structure of ACP is not best-suited to take advantage of opportunities in today's market environment,\" Anchorage's founder and Chief Executive, Kevin Ulrich, wrote.</p><p>He also cited the need to give the fund's investors regular liquidity as another factor contributing to the decision.</p><p>The move comes as many firms that previously invested heavily in distressed debt have shut funds or pivoted to focus more on structured finance and private credit. Apollo Global Management Inc., Ares Management Corp., Blackstone Inc. and Brigade Capital Management are among the money managers making the transition.</p><p>Anchorage's flagship fund aims to make equities-like returns with less volatility. It is up 18.5% for the year through November, handily beating rivals. A Dec. 14 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. note to trading clients said the average return of hedge funds betting on and against stocks for fundamental reasons for the period was 8.9%.</p><p>But the fund has struggled during what has been a technology-led bull market the last several years. Distressed investing opportunities have grown harder to find as easy money from the Federal Reserve has given even struggling companies open access to debt markets.</p><p>Anchorage Capital Closing $7.4 Billion Flagship Hedge Fund</p>",
