  "text": "<p>Shanghai on Tuesday recorded 29 new locally transmitted Covid-19 infections from the day before, after averaging almost 18,000 a day in April, allowing authorities to further ease some measures. To move freely around the city, residents will now only need a negative PCR test within 72 hours, from 48 hours previously.</p><p>There were already some signs of a more relaxed approach by authorities. Some residents, who were allowed out of their compounds early, posted images of themselves eating out at local restaurants.</p><p>City officials also on Tuesday warned lower-level authorities that under no circumstances were they to restrict movement of people living in areas designated as low risk. A major source of public resentment during the current outbreak was that junior officials were often those implementing the most stringent measures.</p><p>The city's largest makeshift Covid-19 treatment center—known as a \"fangcang\" hospital—closed Tuesday, a major step in returning properties taken over as part of the emergency-containment measures to their intended use. The 50,000-bed facility had housed in one of the exhibition centers that played a central role in Shanghai commercial life before the latest outbreak brought economic activity to a halt.</p><p>A 50-point plan to accelerate the city's recovery was unveiled by officials over the weekend, with tax cuts for companies and measures to stabilize supply chains and encourage consumption, including incentives for buyers of electric vehicles.</p><p>Chinese stocks have ralliedas expectations grew that Shanghai would soon exit its lockdown, and amid signs that the government appears to have the virus mostly under control elsewhere despite pockets of infections that continue to sprout up. Shanghai's benchmark indexes had in May their biggest monthly gain this year.</p><p>Still, any economic rebound will likely be limitedbecause Beijing remains committed to its stringent Covid-19 containment policies, said economists, including investment bank Natixis's Alicia García-Herrero.</p><p>Many global banks have cut their annual growth forecast for China as the government's stimulus measures—including infrastructure investment and cheaper mortgages for first-time home buyers—are unlikely to fully erase the damage inflicted by the lockdowns.</p><p>Lockdowns and other Covid-control measures snarled logistics and supply chains in Shanghai, China's most economically significant city and home to the world's busiest port. Consumption slumped and unemployment has risen. The city alone accounts for almost 4% of China's gross domestic product, supporting a vast hinterland of suppliers in neighboring provinces that have seen outbreaks and lockdowns of their own.</p><p>China's National Health Commission reported 94 Covid-19 cases from May 30. More than a third of them were in Beijing and Langfang, a city in Hebei province neighboring the capital. Besides these two and Shanghai, cases were seen in six other provincial-level regions.</p><p>On May 30, Beijing reported one new infection found during mass-testing, breaking a three-day streak of zero cases detected outside the city's quarantine and isolation system.</p><p>Late that night, pandemic control officers arrived at Zhengxinyuan, a housing compound in Fengtai district, to take residents away to a secure facility after one tested positive. They returned at 4 a.m. to take away more residents, according to a local government announcement and social-media posts.</p><p>\"Covid control personnel knocked at the door, what should I do?\" one person living in the compound asked on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform.</p><p>More than 2,500 families were moved, some to a school dormitory turned into a makeshift quarantine facility, according to a video posted by a resident who was taken there.</p><p>Despite the stringent reaction to sporadic outbreaks, China's capital continues to return to normality. In Chaoyang District, the city's business hub, shopping malls, supermarkets and public transportation were all operating normally, although dining-in at restaurants is still not allowed.</p><p>In Jilin, the worst-affected region after Shanghai, average daily Covid-19 cases ticked up over the past 15 days. Absolute numbers—around nine—are below the trigger point for a several previous lockdowns, according to Goldman Sachs. There were 12 new cases in Dandong, a city in Liaoning province bordering North Korea, which is battling a Covid-19 surge.</p><p>Shanghai's officials are eager to show their outbreak is finally over—and to gain some respite after weeks of crisis management.</p><p>Yin Xin, a spokeswoman for the Shanghai government, said there would no longer be a daily press briefing on Covid from Wednesday—after 90 had been held in the current outbreak.</p><p>\"Many comrades have been living in the office for more than two months,\" she said. \"From tomorrow, everyone can return to their families. Tomorrow our city will have a new beginning.\"</p><p>Zhao Yueling and Qianwei Zhang contributed to this article.</p><p>Shanghai Ready to Exit Lockdown as Covid Cases Drop</p>",
