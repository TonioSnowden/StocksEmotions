  "text": "<p>Good morning. There was a pretty sporty sell-off in tech stocks on Thursday, which was interesting. The most popular view is that it was down to the hedging of options. Expect some more odd trading as we head into the Christmas week. In the meantime, email us: <a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=robert.armstrong@ft.com\">robert.armstrong@ft.com</a>&#xa0;and&#xa0;<a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=ethan.wu@ft.com\">ethan.wu@ft.com</a>. </p> <h2>We all really hope it's transitory (Europe edition)</h2> <p>We're all in the transitory boat now. That was the upshot of the three big central bank meetings this week. </p> <p>The headlines told different stories, of course. The European Central Bank said it would do a little more “regular” quantitative easing as its pandemic-specific QE winds down. Across the Channel, the Bank of England raised rates 15 basis points to 0.25 per cent to fight “persistent inflation pressures”. These came after the sunny reception of the Federal Reserve's as-hawkish-as-expected Wednesday meeting.</p> <p>The BoE's move was framed as hawkish. Here's Gurpreet Gill of Goldman Sachs:</p> <blockquote>  <p>The Bank of England surprised yet again, delivering a 0.15 per cent rate hike on strength in underlying inflation pressures and better labour market outcomes than anticipated in its November Monetary Policy Report. </p>  <p>Inflation is expected to peak at around 6 per cent in April 2022, 1 per cent above prior expectations. Notwithstanding virus uncertainty, we anticipate the bank's upcoming rate hiking cycle will be relatively shortlived. We think the base rate will rise to 0.75 per cent next year, then remain on hold for a prolonged period.</p> </blockquote> <p>The ECB's decision to inject more liquidity, on the other hand, was framed as moving against the BoE and Fed. One economist told <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-16/ecb-boosts-conventional-bond-purchases-to-smooth-crisis-exit?srnd=markets-vp\">Bloomberg</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Relative to the Fed's dramatic pivot yesterday and the Bank of England's rate hike today, the European Central Bank remains in the slow lane.</p> </blockquote> <p>As we <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/024e4598-61cf-4871-89dc-0626d71a8c96\">argued on Thursday</a>, don't confuse tactics and strategy. Tactics are diverging because the central banks' short-term battles differ. Eurozone core inflation is at a more-manageable 2.6 per cent, versus 4.1 and 4 per cent in the US and UK, respectively. The ECB is also watching over slacker labour markets like those of Greece and Italy.</p> <p>But all three central banks are united in strategy: don't stifle the labour recovery and fervently hope inflation moderates over the next year. The ostensibly hawkish BoE and Fed are eyeing historically low terminal rates; they are not preparing to choke off inflation by force. If the “transitory” story is wrong, nearly every western economy will be on the hook. (<em>Ethan Wu</em>)</p> <h2>Yield, inflation-protection, and no risk, for now</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b1d70db-edae-474c-bd6f-bb60dfa99c51\">last time</a> I wrote about special purpose acquisition companies — Spacs — I concluded that “The Spac trend appears to be in retreat. Good.” That was a couple of months ago. Now the structure seems to be staging a tentative <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1723a8e-c146-4d48-8475-01cc9947a5d6\">comeback</a>. Part of the story is that Spac sponsors have eased terms for investors, putting extra collateral into their trusts, attaching richer warrants to the shares in the initial public offering, and so on. </p> <p>The other side of the nascent resurgence is strong interest from hedge funds and arbitrageurs. Given that the wheels have very publicly come off some prominent Spacs, one wonders what the appeal is. I spoke to Boaz Weinstein of Saba Capital, who laid out the case for me.</p> <blockquote>  <p>Spacs are very misunderstood. I've never seen a product that could be more aptly described as Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. On the one hand when it de-Spacs [acquires an operating company] it can become this wild beast that can soar or sink. Because there was so much competition months ago, price was no object for a number of deals . . . One aspect is that the [operating] companies can make very bold predictions that they could not make in a traditional IPO.</p> </blockquote> <p>On the other hand, though:</p> <blockquote>  <p>The shareholders are handed a warrant, which they can sell, and can vote for or against any deal, and, separately, they can ask for their cash back [before a deal is consummated]. The cash [raised in the IPO] can only be invested one way: in T-bills held at a bank. Because the trusts reinvest in the short-term T-bills, you are inflation protected. And in every deal in the history of Spacs, the investors have gotten their money back.</p> </blockquote> <p>The result? Investors get “a right-tail option on equity exuberance, and their worst case outcome is to&#xa0; earn a 4 per cent yield which is the going rate for junk bonds”.</p> <p>That right tail option is the stock. The yield — which can actually be more than 3 per cent — is the interesting bit, because Treasury bills do not give you a junk-bond yield. Here's how it works. A typical $10 Spac unit comes with one share and half a warrant with a strike price of $11.50. After buying the unit, the investor might sell the warrant for, say, 30 cents. So now the investors' effective cost is $9.70. With many of the Spac deals that are coming now, the sponsors have over-collateralised the trust to, say, $10.20. So the guaranteed return is 5.2 per cent, plus a bit more from the yield on the Treasury bills. And the investor has the option of owning the stock after the deal with the operating company is done, if it looks promising. &#xa0;</p> <p>The stock represents “a free option rather than a cheap one — it's awesome”, Weinstein says. “In a world where people are afraid of inflation and want safety, this is an overlooked option.”</p> <p>Now, people do not invest with hedge funds to earn 5 per cent, so Saba and others will presumably use leverage to amplify their returns. Why shouldn't they? The yield part of the return is guaranteed, so long as investors hold until they can exercise their option to redeem or buy. It's a tidy little trade. </p> <p>The question is how long it will be available. That 5 per cent yield is risk-free money to investors, but it's coming from somewhere. The Spac sponsors who contribute the extra collateral pay, the warrant buyers pay if the stock falls (they lose their premium), and shareholders pay if the stock rises (they are diluted when the warrants are exercised). Enough sponsors, shareholders and warrant holders need to make money in Spacs that others remain willing to fund the riskless yield that Saba and others are enjoying. There has to be enough good target companies from the Spacs to buy. And the whole thing could be wrecked by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22dcc2fe-f902-40cb-88cb-bcd1cb5ebfa0\">regulators</a>. This is going to be interesting to watch. </p> <h2>One good read</h2> <p>Bloomberg's Matt Levine <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-12-16/the-sec-has-big-plans?srnd=premium-europe\">on</a> the SEC's new spate of rules, the most striking of which is a ban on hedge funds pressuring companies into bankruptcy so that they can cash in on credit default swaps.</p><p>Source: Robert Armstrong and Ethan Wu 2021 'Central banks' crowded trade' FT.com 17 December.
