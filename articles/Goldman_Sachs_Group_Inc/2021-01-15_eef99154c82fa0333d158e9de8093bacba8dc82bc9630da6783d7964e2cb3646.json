  "title": "Potomac Watch:  Big Business's Sharp Left Turn  ----  By Kimberley A. Strassel",
  "text": "<p>   Corporate America took a big step this week, moving from captives of wokeness to active accomplices. The legal and political consequences may prove profound. </p><p>   Big Business over the past four years has increasingly signed up for leftist politics. Some of this was \"wokewashing,\" peddling causes or figures for brand benefit -- think Nike's Colin Kaepernick commercial or Lacoste's replacement of its crocodile logo with endangered species. Some was spinelessness, caving in to the liberal mob -- think Goldman Sachs's refusal to finance fossil-fuel projects. Some was strategic -- Twitter and Facebook attempting to ward off regulation with ever-changing policies on \"misinformation.\" </p><p>   But the events of last week -- the assault on the Capitol and the Democratic Senate takeover -- inspired corporate America to take on a new role. Business titans are positioning themselves as arbiters of political speech and activity -- by withholding essential services to conservative individuals, companies and groups. They've turned themselves into political entities, raising constitutional and antitrust questions. </p><p>   This goes way beyond Big Tech's censoring of Donald Trump and Parler. Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon entered the fray by deploying a bogus rationale for banning the president from the biggest social-media sites, then dismantling the only effective conservative alternative. This alone raises free-speech concerns. </p><p>   The bum's rush that followed put in bright focus the extraordinary power corporate America holds to shut down a political figure, even a party, completely. SnapChat, Twitch and YouTube also disabled Trump accounts, creating a near-total media silencing. Campaign Monitor, an email service provider, confirmed it had suspended Trump campaign emails. Stripe Inc., one of the largest processors of online financial transactions, said it won't process contributions to the Trump campaign. Shopify took offline stores run by Trump entities. In a week, the nation's C-suites disabled the president's ability to speak to the nation and communicate with donors. </p><p>   The media has lumped these actions along with the decision by dozens of other companies to halt political-action committee donations to Republicans who objected to state election results. But companies have no obligation to make contributions, and pulling money is a longtime corporate response to controversial figures. The \"deplatforming\" of Mr. Trump is something new and menacing. Companies are refusing to provide the services that, in our online, interconnected world, are the backbone of all political campaigning and speech. </p><p>   And they highlight the power corporate America has to do this to any conservative for any reason. Today it is Mr. Trump, and the corporations claim it's necessary to prevent more violence. But how long before an online processor refuses to facilitate the credit-card transaction of any American with a Parler account, or an online provider announces it will no longer transmit emails that question climate change? When does Apple start scouring and shutting down iMessages that fit its definition of \"insurrectionist\" talk? </p><p>   The corporate chieftans' response: Private companies get to choose whom to serve and whom to ban. Until a week ago, many conservatives would have agreed. But these actions, coming on the back of Democratic control in Washington and targeting only the Democrats' opponents, change the legal picture. They raise the specter of corporations that have been coerced or co-opted by government itself, making them effective arms of the state -- serving the interest of one-party control. Entities that take on the conduct of government are subject to a different rule book. </p><p>   This past week also highlighted how nonexistent is the usual remedy to corporate excess: competition. The liberal response for years to any conservative griping about Twitter censorship: Don't like it? Start an alternative. Conservatives did, only to watch the tech giants shut down Parler. We live increasingly in an online world, which a few powerful gatekeepers control. </p><p>   Corporations may feel emboldened because Washington Republicans are helpless to impose a legislative or regulatory response; companies likely took these steps in part to curry favor with Democrats. The political fallout will nonetheless be seismic. The GOP may be fractured on discrete policy issues like Section 230, but this week unified them on a far more consequential point: Their reflexive support of Big Business is at an end. This will have far-reaching consequences for upcoming policy battles. </p><p>   Companies have set the stage for a slew of lawsuits on constitutional and antitrust grounds, which could end up reshaping the business landscape. Businesses' actions on the left's behalf open the way for courts to establish new constitutional limitations on conduct. They are also at risk of antitrust and unfair-trade actions by state attorneys general and private parties. </p><p>   Corporate America stepped up as a political enforcer this week. Serious legal and political consequences come with that role. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Write to kim@wsj.com. </p><p></p>",
