The British Medical Association warning that almost 50,000 doctors, nurses and other National Health Service staff in England could be off sick by Christmas Day barring further measures.</p><p>Europe also tracked losses for U.S. stock-index futures ES00NQ00YM00, which fell on COVID concerns and worries that President Joe Biden's key $2 trillion spending bill was in trouble after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), said on Sunday that he couldn't support it.
