  "title": "Credit Suisse Looks to Channel Goldman Sachs; Two hires from the Wall Street bank brought a new tone to the Swiss company's investor day, but shareholders seem to be waiting for concrete results",
  "text": "<p>The bank's strategy remains the same tricky balancing act announced in November—improve risk management while maintaining an entrepreneurial spirit. Its latest effort to explain what that means on the ground scored a full house on the future-of-banking bingo card: cross-selling, recurring fee revenue, high-growth Asian markets, sustainability, private assets, digitizing services, migrating systems to the cloud, automation, data-driven insight and agile working. That is all good stuff, but it needs to be delivered.</p><p>One promising sign was the new arrivals' willingness to call out past mistakes. Until recently, there was the disquieting impression that some in charge believed the bank was fundamentally well run, if only you looked beyond the recent billion-dollar crises.</p><p>Chief Risk Officer David Wildermuth will replace the current siloed, reactive approach to dealing with regulators with a new centralized, proactive group. The credit risk senior team now has more industry experience and direct reporting lines to the CRO rather than the old \"dual hats.\" Mr. Wildermuth showed two improving metrics from the bank's risk scorecard. He also stressed that he is eager to encourage appropriate risk taking too, which will be needed for the bank's revenue growth ambitions.</p><p>Joanne Hannaford, the other Goldman alumni hired as chief technology and operations officer, talked of centralizing a fragmented, federated tech management model. She promises to cut run-rate costs by 200 million Swiss francs in each of the next few years, equivalent to $209 million, while improving efficiency, developing in-house talent and moving to better cloud-based systems. These are just a few examples, but investors have cause to welcome any effort to put meat on the bones of the bank's plan.</p><p>Delivering change won't be easy, particularly as the macroeconomic environment darkens. Zurich is a very different place than Wall Street and can be tough for outsiders. Former Credit Suisse board chairman António Horta-Osório's early ousting was attributed by some to his impatient, hands-on approach to driving through change. The other three executives who led Tuesday's presentations have more than 40 years of Credit Suisse experience between them, bringing valuable institutional knowledge but potentially also some nostalgia that could impede change.</p><p>Credit Suisse shares didn't move significantly Tuesday, and continue to trade at around a third of tangible book value, a big discount to most European and U.S. rivals. After a string of crises and profit warnings, most investors will likely wait for concrete results, but the new brooms from Goldman offer some early hope that this time things might really change.</p><p>Write to Rochelle Toplensky at rochelle.toplensky@wsj.com</p><p>Credit Suisse Looks to Channel Goldman Sachs</p>",
