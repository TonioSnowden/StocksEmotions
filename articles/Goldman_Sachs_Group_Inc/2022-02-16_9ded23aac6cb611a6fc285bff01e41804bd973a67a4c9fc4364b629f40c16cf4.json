  "text": "<p>It is not often that presidential elections include clashes around the technical sticking-points of equity index inclusion, but with less than a month before the nation votes on March 9, South Korea is poised to become an important exception.</p> <p>On three occasions since 2008, the country was considered for recognition by the index-maker MSCI as a developed market, but did not meet eligibility requirements. Being granted that status would raise the world's 10th biggest economy from the splintery benches of the emerging markets boxcar it has ridden for 30 years to the cushioned splendour of the first-class carriage. </p> <p>It is not enough that other benchmarkers — FTSE Russell, Dow Jones and S&amp;P — granted developed market status years ago. Apparently, this is the club membership that matters most to Korea — even if individual companies may be less enchanted by the demands on governance the upgrade would mean.</p> <p>The three rejections have come despite Korea meeting two of MSCI's main criteria for inclusion. The principal grounds of failure have been the country's refusal to allow offshore trading in the won, a move made in 1999 when the emotional scars of the Asian financial crisis still suppurated, and so far protectively left in place. Other reasons include short selling restrictions and convoluted registration processes for foreign investors. </p> <p>The show of momentum for inclusion is eye-catching. The presidential candidate of the incumbent Democratic Party of Korea, Lee Jae-myung, enters election season with a stated policy of attempting to secure the upgrade from MSCI. His main rival has talked, less explicitly, about deregulation that probably amounts to the same thing: since mid-December, finance minister Hong Nam-ki has twice proposed changes to rules that would address the currency and market access issues that have been barriers to promotion. Three weeks ago, the head of the Korea Exchange called a press conference to stress the need for a resumption of short selling.</p> <p>Given the longstanding suspicion in some quarters that Korea was secretly dragging its heels on the MSCI upgrade to retain “big fish, small pond” emerging status, the new noise has caught the attention of investment banks. They know a mega-trade when they see one, and Korea has an easy “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9930245c-b924-11e5-bf7e-8a339b6f2164\">fourth industrial revolution</a>” story to sell: the list of Korea's 10 largest companies is dominated by chipmakers (Samsung, SK Hynix), battery makers (LG Energy), consumer internet (Naver, Kakao) and a potential electric car play (Hyundai Motor). The earliest things can be set in motion again with MSCI would be June, with inclusion in the developed market club by 2024. Brokers are already lining-up ways to bet on that sequence of events now rather than later.</p> <p>Early among those that have run the numbers on the benefits of the promotion is Goldman Sachs. Using its calculation that an officially recognised developed Korea would have a 1.6 per cent weighting in the MSCI World index, it would imply net incremental portfolio flows into Korean stocks from foreign investors of about $44bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>However, the project does have risks, of which two stand out. The first is that Korea, while improving in key areas, remains ninth out of 12 in the Asian Corporate Governance Association's 2021 country rankings. Historic issues, said ACGA's analysts, remain entrenched,&#xa0; and disclosure by mid-cap companies remains unimpressive. </p> <p>It is not that emerging market status has given companies a free pass on governance failings, but developed market rank can fast turn national pride to world-stage embarrassment. It would bring scrutiny that can lay bare not just individual company shortcomings, but the more fundamental question of whether any are truly run for the benefit of shareholders. Korea's family-owned chaebol empires, while cherished as engine-rooms of the economy, may be early victims of this — in which case the government may feel a backlash.</p> <p>But the much greater risk is that both outside observers and Korea itself are underestimating the psychological leap required to meet MSCI's criteria. As an election issue, the securing of developed market status may be presented as a straightforward desire to deliver something Koreans feel they have long deserved. But the necessary changes to offshore won trading and short selling are not mere technicalities to be ticked off. In both cases, they are protectionist expressions of a market that, for all the innovative powers of its companies, is addicted to the status quo. </p> <p>It is probably fitting that the issue plays out in an election context: we are watching a historic clash between national pride and national instinct.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:leo.lewis@ft.com\"><em>leo.lewis@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>This article has been corrected to reflect the fact that countries cannot apply or lobby for inclusion in MSCI's indexes and that South Korea previously did not meet all the criteria for inclusion.</em></p><p>Source: Leo Lewis 2022 'South Korea's push for developed nation status may not be the win it hopes' FT.com 16 February.
