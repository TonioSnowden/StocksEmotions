  "text": "<p>Under state law, vote-by-mail ballots must be counted if they are postmarked by Tuesday and received by Nov. 8. State officials said Monday that nearly 500,000 mail ballots had been received. Election officials in several counties were still processing vote-by-mail ballots Wednesday.</p><p>What Are the Candidates Saying?</p><p>Speaking to supporters just after midnight, Mr. Murphy said, \"We're going to wait for every vote to be counted, and that's how our democracy works.\"</p><p>Mr. Ciattarelli said he would \"do what needs to be done to certify this win.\"</p><p>What Are the Big Issues?</p><p>The race centered largely on taxes. Mr. Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, has criticized Mr. Murphy's fiscal policies and promised to cut state spending. Mr. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive, raised taxes on millionaires and expanded educational programs.</p><p>Mr. Murphy campaigned on his record in office, touting the legalization of marijuana and increases to the state's minimum wage during his tenure. He said he provided stable management during the Covid-19 pandemic, and Monmouth polls showed his job approval rating remained above 50% since the virus arrived in March 2020.</p><p>Write to Jimmy Vielkind at jimmy.vielkind@wsj.com</p><p>When Can We Expect the New Jersey Governor's Race Results?</p>",
