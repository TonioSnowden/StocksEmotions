  "text": "<h2>Russian invasion sends ‘London laundromat' spinning</h2> <p>Since the fall of the Soviet Union, a crop of Russian businessmen with fortunes built thanks to Kremlin connections have found a way of operating within the UK's corridors of power. </p> <p>These oligarchs spent big on everything from mansions to listings on the <strong>London Stock Exchange</strong> to donations to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ccd61c2-0c4d-48ec-bcda-03ad0bb6f85c\">ruling <strong>Conservative party</strong></a>. </p> <p>For politicians, there were perks. There was the time <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/26/boris-johnson-security-evgeny-lebedev-perugia-party\">reportedly</a> seen “looking like he had slept in his clothes” at an Italian airport, after a party at the home of <strong>Evgeny Lebedev</strong>.</p> <p>(Johnson's decision to nominate Lebedev, the ​​son of an ex-<strong>KGB</strong> officer and owner of the <strong>London Evening Standard</strong> and <strong>Independent </strong>newspapers, to the House of Lords <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25b7ee93-5b0b-4a23-87e9-125793e8c111\">is under serious scrutiny</a>.)</p> <p>And who can forget <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b19d8f8-a476-11dd-8104-000077b07658\">the time</a> former UK chancellor<strong> George Osborne </strong>and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1d857dc-8aa8-11de-ad08-00144feabdc0\">former Labour cabinet minister</a> <strong>Peter Mandelson</strong> climbed aboard <strong>Oleg Deripaska's </strong>yacht.</p> <p>Deripaska, the founder of Russian metals and hydropower company <strong>EN+,</strong> has been under <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm0338\">US sanctions</a> since 2018 as a result of his alleged close ties to the Kremlin.</p> <p>Though Deripaska's superyacht Clio was as of last week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/428dfd0b-69e3-4a5b-ae25-08fbbb3c5950\">docked in the Maldives</a>, according to <strong>VesselsValue</strong>, the oligarch and his friends in ‘Londongrad' are sinking fast. </p> <p>The wreckage includes those who helped him along the way. </p> <p><strong>EN+ </strong>chair<strong> Greg Barker</strong>, a former minister in <strong>David Cameron</strong>'s coalition government, on Monday became the latest in an exodus of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6b5a49e-9bdd-495e-83e3-5508c0130651\">top executives and City grandees</a> to step down from positions of power at companies with strong ties to Russia.</p> <p>In 2019, Barker was credited with brokering a deal with the US government to lift sanctions on EN+ and its London-listed subsidiary <strong>Rusal</strong>. In exchange, Deripaska relinquished control of the company.</p> <p>For his efforts, he was rewarded handsomely. Barker pocketed a $5.9mn “discretionary bonus” for his role in the deal, in addition to a $1.9mn salary. He earned $4mn in 2020 while his 2021 pay is still unknown.</p> <p>Barker's proximity to establishment figures proved useful for EN+. Last year, the FT revealed that he turned to Osborne, his close friend from government, to hook the former chancellor up with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf936f46-a6c8-4ca2-b0db-95fc1155a42f\">his first advisory mandate</a> since becoming an investment banker at <strong>Robey Warshaw.</strong></p> <p>Readers got in touch after the story to question why the otherwise blue-chip advisory firm would take on such work. It is also noteworthy that Osborne, before becoming a banker, served as editor of the <strong>Evening Standard</strong> thanks to his close relationship with Lebedev. </p> <p>There have been other high-profile exits since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last week City veteran <strong>James Rutherford</strong> quit the board of <strong>Evraz</strong>, the London-listed steelmaker controlled by <strong>Chelsea football club </strong>owner <strong>Roman Abramovich</strong>. Six board members from Russian gold miner<strong> Polymetal</strong> have stepped down. </p> <p>Johnson has spoken of change. “There is no place for dirty money in the UK . . . those backing Putin have been put on notice: there will be nowhere to hide your ill-gotten gains,” the prime minister said last week.</p> <p>But many doubt it is possible to put a stop to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfb74ef3-13d2-492a-b8da-c70b6340ccdd\">“London laundromat”</a> that has for decades spun billions of pounds — some of it obtained through illegal means — from Russia's economy and into London's capital markets. </p> <p>Nor is it clear that Johnson's Conservative party is capable of achieving it. One contact explained to DD that Russian money is the equivalent of a gas pipeline fuelling the Tories' financial coffers whenever there is a crisis.</p> <h2>Advisers pack up their Russian outposts</h2> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31d1ea08-3634-40c3-9c20-413c2efc9f6c\">we told you about</a> the increasingly precarious tightrope professional services advisers have been walking between Russia and the west. </p> <p>A lot has happened since then, and some firms have quit the balancing act altogether.</p> <p>After a week of relatively vague statements amid <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04643842-4c2b-489f-8c24-f349043308ed\">fear of backlash</a> from the Russian government, <strong>PwC </strong>and<strong> KPMG </strong>became the first Big Four accounting firms to announce plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/be3d59a3-d9b2-4303-946d-d61d32c2ff08\">sever ties with their operations</a> in the country. <strong>Deloitte</strong> and<strong> EY</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b26e0e8-af55-4b33-b55e-4894875c5692\">quickly followed suit</a>.</p> <p>Management consultancies<strong> McKinsey </strong>and<strong> Boston Consulting Group</strong>, which previously said they wouldn't work for Russian government entities but stopped short of dropping other clients, also took their statements <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c412673-d65e-4e75-adbb-08146c42387c\">a step further</a>.</p> <p>McKinsey said it would immediately cease work for state-owned entities in Russia and suspend all client work there once its other projects ended, while BCG's chief<strong> Christoph Schweizer</strong> wrote in a memo to staff that “while honouring our contractual obligations, we have already started to wind down work [in Russia] where possible”.</p> <p><strong>Accenture </strong>went as far as to say it was closing its business in Russia entirely.</p> <p>The stakes are rising in the world of elite law firms, too.</p> <p>On Friday <strong>Linklaters</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6eeed74a-01c2-4ad5-8e2d-fc936c3ee882\">became the first major firm</a> to withdraw from Russia, days after its Magic Circle rival <strong>Allen &amp; Overy</strong> said it would “stop all Russia-linked work that goes against our values”.</p> <p><strong>Freshfields </strong>pledged to review its Russian mandates and axed the <strong>Gazprom</strong>-owned <strong>Nord Stream 2</strong> as a client, according to a person with knowledge of the internal decision-making.</p> <p>International groups have also advised banks or other parties in major deals involving Russian companies. Leading the pack is US firm <strong>Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton</strong>, which played a role in more than $70bn worth of deals involving at least one of a group of 14 Russian companies covered by western sanctions or restrictions between 2010 and 2022.</p> <p>The firm, which has advised energy groups <strong>Rosneft </strong>and Gazprom, wasn't always acting for the Russian party in those deals and said in a statement that it was “complying with all applicable sanctions”.</p> <h2>Desperate Spacs: plugging the gap</h2> <p>Blank-cheque dealmakers are stressed. The pandemic-era frenzy has fizzled, with investors fast withdrawing their money and deals being abandoned almost daily. </p> <p>The desperation to complete deals has now led dealmakers to turn to alternative funds including <strong>Atalaya Capital Management</strong> and private equity group <strong>Apollo</strong> in a short-term<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/991d89ec-1036-4a9e-b456-27a4a2256d30\"> scramble for cash</a>. </p> <p>It works like this: a Spac merger must meet its minimum cash requirement to close, otherwise the deal collapses. As investor redemptions continue rising — average withdrawals hit 89 per cent last month, according to <strong>Dealogic</strong> — dealmakers are rushing to plug the shortfall.</p> <p>This is where the alternative funds step in. They buy shares from the redeeming Spac investors while getting significant benefits. </p> <p>The structure, called an “equity prepaid forward transaction”, has cropped up in several Spac deals spotted by the FT's Josh Franklin and Nikou Asgari, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/991d89ec-1036-4a9e-b456-27a4a2256d30\">shows how desperate</a> Spac teams are to finalise their mergers.</p> <p>Apollo entered into a $75mn agreement for <strong>General Motors</strong>-backed car data analysis company <strong>Wejo</strong>'s Spac deal last year. Atalaya agreed $70mn for aircraft hangar rental company <strong>Sky Harbour Group</strong>, $30mn for semiconductor company <strong>Navitas </strong>and up to $100mn for online grocer <strong>Boxed</strong>. </p> <p>After buying the shares, the funds can then enjoy what most investors only dream of — reaping both upside, and downside protection, from the deal.</p> <p>In the Sky Harbour merger, whose top investors include <strong>Paul Glazer's</strong> <strong>Glazer Capital Management</strong>, Atalaya agreed to buy $70mn worth of shares from redeeming shareholders before the deal closed.</p> <p>Just a day after Sky Harbour listed, it reimbursed Atalaya for the purchase price of the shares. After that, if Sky Harbour's share price rises, the fund can sell its stock and keep the profit, or if the stock falls below $5, the fund can receive a make-whole payment from the company.</p> <p>One Spac banker said some funds have been circling like “parasites”, adding: “It's desperate companies signing up because a lot of these [mergers] don't guarantee cash.”</p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Tushar Morzaria</strong>,<strong> Barclays</strong>' longtime finance director <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7f22c43-3c2b-441c-8774-b2225dafd8f0\">who is retiring</a> in April, has been appointed to the board of <strong>Legal &amp; General </strong>as an independent non-executive director. <strong>Anne Farlow</strong>, chair of <strong>Bill Ackman</strong>'s investment group <strong>Pershing Square Holdings</strong>, has been appointed as a non-executive director of the UK's <strong>Caledonia Investments</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Polestar</strong>, the Swedish electric vehicle maker spun off from <strong>Volvo Cars </strong>and backed by actor <strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong>, plans to appoint its chief executive <strong>Thomas Ingenlath </strong>and Volvo's new CEO<strong> Jim Rowan </strong><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220307005314/en/Polestar-to-Strengthen-Board-of-Directors-Ahead-of-Nasdaq-Listing\">among others</a> to its board ahead of its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/506bcd0f-71fd-4678-a96a-5c1c5fb51d0f\">$20bn Spac debut</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Citigroup </strong>tech banker <strong>Herb Yeh</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-07/citigroup-global-tech-co-head-yeh-departing-firm-for-evercore?cmpid=BBBXT030722_DEALS&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=220307&amp;utm_campaign=deals&amp;sref=OziMsGoK\">is leaving</a> to join boutique investment bank <strong>Evercore</strong>, per Bloomberg.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Smart reads</strong></p> <p><strong>Project Hotrod</strong> After co-operating with the US justice department, private equity billionaire Robert Smith thought he was able to put in the past his role in a massive tax evasion plot.
