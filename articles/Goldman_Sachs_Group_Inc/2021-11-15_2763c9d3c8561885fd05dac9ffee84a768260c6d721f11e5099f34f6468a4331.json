  "text": "<h1>This bubble is in everything</h1> <p>They never ring a bell at market tops, but there is a long history of high-profile bears throwing in the towel at inflection points. Just last year, <strong>AJO</strong>'s<strong> Ted Aronson</strong> called it quits almost exactly at the end of the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc7ce313-92f8-4f51-902b-f883afc1e035\"> worst run</a> for value stocks in two centuries. Perma bear <strong>Russell Clark</strong> has now emerged as another victim of this remarkable cycle.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/983ec453-f673-49d9-b215-6b6690a9a616\">Clark's formative experience</a> was day-trading technology stocks in the dotcom bubble; he eventually lost almost all of his money when it burst. That made the Australian even more contrarian by nature. He expressed this view at <strong>Horseman Capital Management</strong>, which became <strong>Russell Clark Investment Management</strong>, where he has spent much of the past decade net short on stocks, and most recently short technology stocks. Ouch.</p> <p>That has cost him dearly, as tech stocks have kept on climbing. Last week Clark finally called it a day, telling his <a href=\"https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/hedge-fund-perma-bear-clark-surrenders-to-historic-bull-market\">dwindling group of investors</a> that it was “time to step back, have a think about where we are going, and then come back when I can see an opportunity for my skill set”.&#xa0;</p> <p>His exit comes as financial markets seem to have tipped from euphoria into what some analysts call a “FOMO” rally or a “fear of missing out” boom, as my colleague<em>s Robin Wigglesworth, Katie Martin </em>and<em> George Steer</em>​ explore in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/637b2a59-f64d-46b6-a8a8-0072e3a936d2\">this piece</a>. <strong>Peter van Dooijeweert</strong>, head of <strong>Man Group</strong>'s solution unit, said investing had become akin to a video game — and not one of the better ones. “It feels like <em>Candy Crush</em>.”</p> <p>The options market is probably the best example of this current frothiness. This month a record $2.6tn worth of US stock options traded in a single day, according to <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>. Some cynics have long joked that the equity market has become a derivative of the options market — but today that rings somewhat true. The nominal options trading volumes are running about 50 per cent higher than actual US equity trading. No wonder many investors are getting antsy. </p> <h1>The times they are a-changin' </h1> <p>This year, the activist campaign by <strong>Engine No 1</strong> at <strong>Exxon</strong> reached its thrilling climax. It was billed as a modern day <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebfdf67d-cbce-40a5-bb29-d361377dea7a\">David-and-Goliath tale</a> for Wall Street: a tiny hedge fund went up against the mightiest oil company in the US and won three seats on its board, with a mandate to prepare it for a future free of fossil fuels. </p> <p>This successful campaign marks just one sign that shareholders are willing to adopt more confrontational tactics with companies over global warming. And increasingly, big investors including <strong>ABP</strong>, one of the world's largest pension funds, and Norway's oil fund, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, are announcing divestment plans. </p> <p>This marks a changing in attitude from the engagement typically favoured by big asset managers, who argue that it is better to stay invested and try to alter corporate behaviour through background conversations with companies. And it could have huge ramifications for businesses around the world, as my colleague <em>Attracta Mooney </em>reports in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee08d61d-4c98-4398-9971-93036d67e91e\">this Big Read</a>.</p> <p><strong>Aviva Investors </strong>is one such group that has toughened its approach after becoming frustrated with the pace of progress through engagement alone. It warned about 30 fossil fuel-intensive companies that, if they failed to take radical action to slash their emissions, it would sell out across its equities and fixed-income portfolios within one to three years.</p> <p>“An approach where you have perpetual engagement with no real change at a corporate level will be untenable,” said <strong>Mirza Baig</strong>, global head of environmental, social and governance investments at Aviva. “We have to be bold enough to walk away.”</p> <h1>Chart of the week </h1> <p>Global dividends are poised to exceed pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, earlier than analysts had expected, buoyed by mining companies benefiting from a commodities boom. Shareholder payouts in the third quarter were just 2 per cent below their early 2020 record level, according to fund manager <strong>Janus Henderson</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ee77fc5-f41c-4a74-9f1d-59e5a110cb0f\">latest dividends index</a>. Dividends rose 22 per cent globally year on year on an underlying basis, with 90 per cent of companies either raising them or keeping them steady over the third quarter.</p> <h1>10 unmissable asset management stories this week</h1> <p><strong>Credit Suisse</strong>'s decision to exit the business of prime broking highlights how the industry that serves hedge funds is braced for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4e95d7e-5d44-43e8-9646-ae99d4b518c3\">a new era</a> after the collapse of family office <strong>Archegos Capital</strong> left its banks nursing $10bn in losses.</p> <p><em>Katie Martin </em>delves into the punctured egos and schadenfreude behind the recent nightmare for macro hedge fund managers, who bet big on the global interest rate outlook and lost. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01f0d940-9a59-4085-91cc-f9bdc6fd07ec\">Her message</a> to investors? It is wise to buckle up. </p> <p>Computer-powered hedge fund group <strong>AQR Capital Management</strong> is continuing to retrench operations after several lean years for many systematic trading strategies. The $137bn investment group led by <strong>Clifford Asness</strong> is to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9632f317-11ba-49c6-b989-723c58afeadc\">remove five partners</a> from its ranks and trim its bond arm. </p> <p>Funds raised by technology start-ups' public listings in mainland China are on track for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a9fdadb-2985-4c2b-a509-338145c89b6a\">first annual drop</a> in seven years as Beijing's crackdown on the lucrative sector sends investors in search of alternative markets. </p> <p>The US investment industry's top regulator has the $4.2tn private equity industry in its sights. <strong>Gary Gensler</strong>, chair of the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f49d0483-be91-417d-9688-aea700743f03\">told a conference</a> in Washington he wanted to simplify and standardise the disclosure of fees. </p> <p>In a disappointing move for investors, the government looks like it plans to water down corporate governance reforms. Notably a proposal to use legislation to require directors to sign off on companies' internal controls over financial reporting, modelled on the US's Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is expected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8dfb3f06-ea4e-4437-90a8-6cc732fe2bf2\">to be dropped</a>.</p> <p><em>John Plender</em> reports on how the push by fund managers for decarbonisation and social responsibility is primarily an equity market phenomenon. Bonds are an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5de087af-9ac0-40c5-84a8-a873f6600eeb\">ESG blind spot</a> in investing — and here's why this is a problem.</p> <p><strong>Izzy Englander</strong>'s <strong>Millennium Management</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0a32313-625d-43db-9c59-eefecca6e2f6\">returning about $15bn</a> to investors while raising billions of dollars in a private equity-style format as it tries to build a longer-term, more stable asset base. Investor demand to get into the fund has allowed it to rejig its capital base in a way few other firms are able. &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Element Capital</strong>, the New York-based hedge fund run by <strong>Jeffrey Talpins</strong>, is among the highest-profile losers from fixed income ructions. It sustained a roughly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/157afec9-cb6f-469b-a5d0-c25b8fd6ac17\">$1bn loss</a> last month, amid a painful month for macro hedge funds.</p> <p>Volatility in natural gas prices helped one US hedge fund bag profits of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f36352b-ec45-4159-93de-2fe697ebacd0\">more than $400m</a> in October alone. Miami-based <strong>Statar Capital</strong>, which manages about $2bn in assets and is headed by <strong>Ron Ozer</strong>, made about 23.5 per cent last month.</p> <h1>And finally</h1> <p>Contemporary artist <strong>Pablo Bronstein</strong> has created&#xa0;a series of large-scale watercolours especially for Sir John Soane's Museum — one of my favourite places to explore in London. <em>Hell in its Heyday</em> takes you on a nostalgic and ironic&#xa0;tour of hell, reimagining the last two centuries of progress. It's particularly infernal if you visit by night: the&#xa0;museum is <a href=\"https://www.soane.org/whats-on/soane-lates\">open late</a> on November 26.</p><p>Source: Harriet Agnew, Asset Management Editor 2021 'The ‘FOMO' rally and the ‘everything bubble'' FT.com 15 November.
