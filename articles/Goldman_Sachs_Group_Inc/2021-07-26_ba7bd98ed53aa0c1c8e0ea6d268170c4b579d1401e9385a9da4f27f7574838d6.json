  "title": "Fibre broadband ‘gold rush': can the UK's alt-nets pull it off?             ",
  "text": "<p>Beneath the streets of London this summer a network of small disused tunnels, installed more than a century ago to supply power for trams, is being given a new lease of life. </p> <p>To the relief of bored commuters, the £1bn project will see them house new fibre cables, enabling broadband both for Tube passengers and businesses above ground. </p> <p>But the installation by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c550366d-3d09-4271-8bfe-51996333061c\">BAI Communications</a> points to a deeper shift that will shape UK communications infrastructure for years to come — the coming of age of alternative networks, or “alt-nets”, who are spending huge amounts of money to compete in the increasingly crowded UK market. </p> <p>About 50 such companies, backed by funds promising billions of pounds, have burst on to the scene in recent years pledging to take the fight to Openreach, the networking division of incumbent BT, as well as Virgin Media's cable network. </p> <p>Ranging from those targeting customers in underserved rural areas to others seeking to become a partner for other telecoms companies, they can claim to have forced Britain's broadband upgrade to go faster than it might have otherwise.</p> <p>The prize is the promise of long-term riches should they beat the giants in offering ultrafast broadband in the great fibre land grab. Consumer demand for “gigabit” speed broadband — more than 10 times faster than the average today — is expected to soar, with the assumption that prices will rise to match. </p> <p>“There's only one reason for the alt-net boom. Someone made a bold decision to go after Openreach and its cushy position,” said Greg Mesch, founder and chief executive of CityFibre. </p> <p>They have attracted a wave of investment from some of the world's biggest funds including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b934b2e-ee8f-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195\">KKR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a65cfe8e-0b84-46c2-9e60-a6998c000cc0\">Macquarie</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba2f2477-70a5-4680-b087-7395cecbd2fe\">Oaktree Capital Management</a>, Warburg Pincus and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da498c2e-31c3-492d-b5ee-57d0691454e5\">Universities Superannuation Scheme</a>, the largest private pension scheme in the UK.</p> <p>When Mesch launched CityFibre back in 2011, he carried rolled up maps of provincial cities such as York to meeting after meeting to prove there was an opportunity for a third network in the UK. Years spent arguing his case paid off: Goldman Sachs' West Street Infrastructure Fund and Antin Infrastructure Partners bought the early mover in 2017. </p> <p>Even Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f957805-0a19-449f-a875-43c09d338f53\">joined the fibre fray</a>: last month his investment vehicle agreed to back a £1bn plan for a new alt-net to connect 1m homes in East Anglia. </p> <p>The deal tipped the amount pledged by alt-net investors towards £8bn, according to Financial Times calculations. That compares with the £15bn BT plans to invest via its Openreach division to upgrade its copper lines to fibre to 25m homes by 2025. Virgin Media, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9329ed0e-6ba4-46ed-992c-2b9538507e36\">newly merged with O2</a>, has said it wants to expand its own cable and fibre footprint by 8m homes if it can find backers. </p> <p>The question now is whether, despite being awash with funding, these minnows can succeed. </p> <p>The frenzy has given rise to fears of over-saturation with 75m lines — more than double the number of premises in the UK — set to be built, according to research group Analysys Mason. </p> <p>CityFibre, Hyperoptic, Gigaclear and Community Fibre were the first members of the new generation but the number of companies applying to regulator Ofcom to lay fibre has boomed in recent months.</p> <p>Olaf Swantee, a former EE chief executive and European telecoms veteran who is now chair of Community Fibre, argues that the opportunity is still huge, even after the number of full fibre lines rose to 21 per cent of British homes from only 4 per cent three years ago. </p> <p>London-based CityFibre plans to connect 8m homes as part of a £4bn investment. Having steadily built up its network over a decade it wants to reach 1m homes by the end of this year.</p> <p>But there is the pressure to deliver. For all the fanfare around filling the fibre void there is a disparity between ambitious plans and how many have started building at scale, some in the industry argue. </p> <p>“Some alt-nets just have PowerPoint presentations and no teams on the ground but have received backing. They have opened the street [ducts] and had a look but they haven't got a [planning] permit yet,” Swantee said. </p> <p>Matt Yardley, managing partner at Analysys Mason, expects that alt-nets may have to rethink ambitious plans as Openreach delivers on BT's promise to “build like fury” and the government's Project Gigabit subsidy plan for rural areas kicks in. “Those boundaries will be very fluid as plans change,” he said. </p> <p>With hot money pouring in there are also fears that some investors are not looking before they leap. </p> <p>Steffen Leiwesmeier, head of digital infrastructure financing at Hamburg Commercial Bank, is a long-term alt-net investor having funded Deutsche Glasfaser and UK players Hyperoptic and Trooli among others. But he warned there were signs that investors are not setting strict enough rules when tempted by increasingly aggressive business plans.</p> <p>“The number of alt-nets is exploding. There are so many investors with too much money that have to spend it somewhere. It's a huge problem,” he said. </p> <p>The German financier added that some alt-nets assume they will take more than 50 per cent of the market if they lay fibre before anyone else. “It is a business case that does not work,” he said, pointing to their equivalents elsewhere in Europe who built solid businesses but could not hit similar ambitious targets.</p> <p>One adviser to funds that have backed alt-nets gave a blunter assessment, saying the companies are seen as “gold diggers”. </p> <p>The new fibre frenzy is often compared with the cable rush of the 1980s and 1990s when dozens of new operators emerged to battle Sky in the pay-TV market and BT in telecoms. </p> <p>US media titans such as John Malone, Viacom and Comcast backed tiny UK cable players that pledged to take on and beat their larger rivals; their bravado was captured by Adam Singer, who ran one of the largest players Telewest, when he compared the start-ups to Pizarro, the Spanish conquistador, who robbed the Incas — here the traditional broadcasters — of their gold.</p> <p>But that new crop of cable operators was slowly rolled up by NTL which, struggling with the $23bn of debt it used to buy its rivals and to integrate them, went into bankruptcy protection in 2002 before transforming into Virgin Media.</p> <p>Many within the telecoms industry predict a wave of consolidation, with some of the private equity and infrastructure funds that own the fledgling networks already weighing up options, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation. “We are in a period of experimentation,” said Yardley. </p> <p>Mesch agreed that the endgame would be a roll up of the dozens of players into a stronger beast. “Consolidation is inevitable in this industry.”</p> <p>Before this shakes out some are bracing for a bumpy ride. </p> <p>Richard Tang, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cad60a1b-a833-4a53-86f1-38a4c6d3762a\">founder of broadband company Zen Internet</a>, said he was already losing staff to alt-nets paying “ridiculous salaries”. He fears many are pumping themselves up for a future sale that may never happen. “They're playing a very risky game,” he said.<br></p><p>Source: Nic Fildes 2021 'Fibre broadband ‘gold rush': can the UK's alt-nets pull it off?
