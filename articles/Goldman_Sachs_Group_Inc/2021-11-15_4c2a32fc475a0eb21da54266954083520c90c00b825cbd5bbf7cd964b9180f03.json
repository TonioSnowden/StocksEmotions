  "text": "<p>Argentine president Alberto Fernández's centre-left coalition has pledged to seek co-operation with the opposition and present a new economic programme in hopes of reaching a deal with the IMF, after his Peronist party suffered a heavy setback in midterm elections.<br><br>Voters <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09a8cd83-616c-48a0-8066-0c96fdeb16b9\">punished</a> the ruling Peronist party in the face of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdd1ce4e-8cd8-46fc-b0a2-d48c98afc726\">spiralling inflation and rising poverty</a> in midterm polls on Sunday, where half of the lower house and one-third of the Senate was up for election. </p> <p>Together for Change, the conservative opposition coalition, was narrowly ahead in six of eight key senate races, putting the Peronists on course to lose their Senate majority for the first time since the country's return to democracy in 1983. This included clear wins in an important lower-house contest in Buenos Aires province, home to almost 40 per cent of the electorate and a Peronist stronghold.<br><br>After the results, Fernández vowed to “seek dialogue” with the opposition, in the clearest sign to date of how the president plans to respond to his party's defeat. During a televised address, he said he planned to present an economic plan to congress in the first week of December and reach a “sustainable” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/814e0898-30d5-4b4f-b468-dddfd447af7c\">agreement with the IMF</a> on rescheduling $44bn in debt, most of which comes due for payment next year and in 2023.</p> <p>“In this new stage, we will deepen our efforts to reach a sustainable agreement with the IMF. We must clear the uncertainties that come with this sort of unsustainable debt,” Fernández said.</p> <p>Markets looked favourably on the prospect of a greater role for the opposition in curbing the coalition's powers. Dollar-denominated bonds due in 2035 rose 0.7 cent to about 31 cents on the dollar on Monday, their biggest gain since the aftermath of primary elections held on September 12.</p> <p>“Peronism faces something entirely new: it has lost quorum in the chamber and in congress,” Sergio Berensztein, a political consultant, told the Financial Times from Buenos Aires. With a poor showing in the midterms, internal divisions are set to sharpen within the Peronist party, between a mix of moderates aligned with the president and a radical wing led by Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, the vice-president. <br><br>Tensions within the ruling Peronist bloc had burst into the open after the September primary vote, when the opposition beat the government by 9 percentage points. In response, the government made new cabinet appointments that suggested Fernández had ceded further ground to his powerful deputy. </p> <p>Fernández de Kirchner later published an open letter blaming the president's economic policies for the “political catastrophe” of the primaries and demanding changes.</p> <p>Fernández de Kirchner, a towering Peronist figure who served as president from 2007 to 2015, was notably absent on Sunday night. She announced she would not be making an appearance for health reasons after early exit polls showed signs of a centre-left defeat, including in Santa Cruz province, her family's political stronghold. </p> <p>The government now faces a dilemma of whether to work with the opposition in order to pass laws and make important appointments, including to the judiciary, or further radicalise. </p> <p>Alberto Ramos, head of Latin America economics at Goldman Sachs, said that “internal dissent over policy direction could grow”, and that a weakened mandate raised the risk “of more populist near-term policies”, such as stepping up government controls on the economy and insisting the IMF gives way in negotiations to repay <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce0d1647-0bd7-4bb4-b787-d1301a8a3bc0\">billions of dollars</a> from its record-breaking bailout. </p> <p>“​​A more market-friendly composition of Congress could lead to more effective checks and balances and ultimately a policy regime shift in 2023,” Ramos added. However, ​​“macro and financial volatility is likely to remain high”, he said, given the deep imbalances that the Argentine economy faced such as high state subsidies and a fiscal deficit financed by printing money.</p> <p>The midterms are viewed as an early indication of the opposition's strength as it gears up for a presidential race in 2023. </p> <p>The dire state of the economy has also weakened the two-party system and led to a surge in support for more extreme candidates. Inflation in Argentina is running at an annual rate of 52.1 per cent, according to the latest official data, and 40.6 per cent of people were living in poverty in the first half of 2021, up from 35 per cent when Fernández took office.</p> <p>One standout performance in the city of Buenos Aires was Javier Milei, a 51-year-old outsider who won a congressional seat with 17 per cent of the vote. It was one of two seats in congress that his Freedom Moves Forward coalition secured in Sunday's election. </p> <p>Milei chose a famous music venue on Sunday to welcome thousands of his supporters as the results were announced. Milei's libertarian platform includes abolishing the central bank, free love and breaking up the “caste system” in Argentine politics. </p> <p>“Help me change this country,” he called from the main stage to raucous applause at Luna Park Stadium. Allies of Horacio Rodríguez Larreta, the popular Buenos Aires city mayor, won races in the capital and the surrounding Buenos Aires province that he hopes will make him favourite to lead the opposition in 2023.</p><p>Source: Lucinda Elliott in Buenos Aires 2021 'Argentina's Peronists promise policy reset after midterm poll setback' FT.com 15 November.
