  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Ex-Goldman Official Tapped  For Chairman of Bitcoin Firm  ----  By Paul Vigna",
  "text": "<p>   Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd., a bitcoin-focused firm offering banking and institutional services, named former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive Michael Daffey as its chairman ahead of a planned U.S. stock offering later this year. </p><p>   Mr. Daffey, 54 years old, succeeds founder Michael Novogratz, who will remain chief executive. </p><p>   Mr. Daffey was most recently the chairman of Goldman's global markets division, which generated more than 40% of the firm's overall revenue in the first quarter. His last day was March 31. </p><p>   The appointment is Galaxy's latest maneuver as it prepares to make a public stock offering in the U.S. later this year. Its shares are already listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In March, it named Alex Ioffe as chief financial officer; Mr. Ioffe previously held the same position at Virtu Financial Inc. </p><p>   Galaxy Digital began as an investment-management firm but has since expanded into more financial services, including investment banking and trading. On Monday, it filed a submission with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a bitcoin-focused exchange-traded fund. </p><p>   \"We are trying to build a 21st-century, customer-focused merchant bank,\" Mr. Novogratz said, referring to the kind of bank that caters to commercial clients and high-net-worth investors. </p><p>   Like others in the crypto sector, Galaxy has seen its operations flourish amid a boom in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the end of March, its assets under management had risen to $1.28 billion, from $356 million a year earlier. Though the company hasn't reported its full financial results for the first quarter, it posted a profit of $335.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, versus a loss of $31.2 million a year earlier. </p><p>   Such numbers have Galaxy and others in the crypto space eyeing the public equities market. Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase Global Inc., which has also seen exponential growth, fetched an $85 billion valuation on Wednesday in its stock-market debut. There are only a handful of other U.S. publicly traded companies in the sector, including Riot Blockchain Inc. and Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. </p><p>   \"There's a dearth of good, public equities in the crypto space,\" Mr. Novogratz said. \"I think you'll see other companies try to fill out that portfolio.\" </p><p>   Mr. Daffey, an Australian, started at Goldman in 1994. He became a managing director after six years and a partner after two more. He became chairman of the global markets division in 2020, managing some of the company's most important hedge-fund clients. </p><p>   Messrs. Daffey and Novogratz worked together at Goldman in Asia in the 1990s. Mr. Novogratz later worked at Fortress Investment Group before founding Galaxy in 2017. </p><p>   Mr. Daffey said he started paying attention to bitcoin in March 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic surged. The topic became one he heard about from clients daily, he said, and that got his attention. \"It reminds me of Wall Street 20 years ago,\" he said. </p><p>   He was circumspect about how he will handle his new job, which he doesn't officially begin until Sept. 1. \"This is a great, new next chapter for me. I have a lot to learn,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
