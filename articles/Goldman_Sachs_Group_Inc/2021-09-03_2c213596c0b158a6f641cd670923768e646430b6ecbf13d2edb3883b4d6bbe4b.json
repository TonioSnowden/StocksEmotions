  "text": "<p>The Covid vaccine makers are rightly getting the acclaim, the financial rewards, the Barbie dolls made in their image and soon the Nobel Prizes. But however many lives vaccines save, they are not a magic wand to return us to pre-pandemic norms.</p> <p>In the US, companies are in denial about this. Faced with resurgent Covid cases but determined to get back to the old work rhythms after Labor Day, the go-to response, from Walmart to Goldman Sachs, is a vaccine mandate.&#xa0;</p> <p>This is not an easy option. It is bold to impose a vaccine requirement on reluctant staff in a tight labour market where they may quit. The policy is also violently opposed by many Republican politicians, who are trying to ban it. </p> <p>However commendable the results, it will not ensure that workplaces are safe. Studies have shown that vaccinated people can become infected with the Delta variant and transmit it to others. </p> <p>Companies need other tools if they want to get more people back to the office this September at a time when Covid hospitalisations are nine times higher than the same time last year in the UK and three times higher in the US, in spite of the vaccination programmes.</p> <p>“There's been so much support for the vaccination strategy, so much hype behind it, that instead of it being considered as part of the whole response, it's become the response,” says Sanjeev Krishna, professor of medicine at St George's, University of London, and a consultant to UK testing company Mologic.</p> <p>Testing lacks the cachet of vaccines. Diagnostics companies such as Roche, Abbott and Quidel are not on the tip of the tongue in the same way as Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna.</p> <p>It doesn't help that the sector's most famous face appeared in a San Jose courtroom this week: Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was there for the start of her trial on fraud charges.</p> <p>The promise of Theranos, if not the reality, is what we need now: revolutionary, rapid and accurate tests. (Have no doubt that if Theranos were still around, it would have pivoted to Covid-19, just as it did for previous high-profile threats such as Zika.)</p> <p>For Covid, cheap and reliable antigen tests are available, although they have never been deployed in the numbers their advocates wish. Such was the low demand in the US earlier in the summer that one of the biggest providers, Abbott Laboratories, binned unused test cards and laid off workers, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/us/abbott-covid-tests.html\">The New York Times</a> reported. Now it cannot keep up with renewed demand.</p> <p>Even where tests are available, they are not often deployed effectively. In one workplace that says it requires twice-weekly tests, a straw poll of staff found that only 1 in 10 complied, though most of the others said they did test, just less frequently, and would be prepared to adhere to the schedule if there were any verification process.</p> <p>One source of friction that has yet to be solved is the time to wait for results. Even 15 minutes is a barrier to deploying tests more widely as a gating tool at workplaces, concert venues or airports. </p> <p>“There's a huge amount of research and development . . . on new technologies doing 10-second, 20-second tests but none of them are fit for purpose yet” says Tim Peto, professor of medicine at the University of Oxford. To have a sniffer thing where you breathe out, like a breathalyser, that's what you want.”</p><p>Source: Tom Braithwaite 2021 'Tests can help get workers back to the office' FT.com 3 September.
