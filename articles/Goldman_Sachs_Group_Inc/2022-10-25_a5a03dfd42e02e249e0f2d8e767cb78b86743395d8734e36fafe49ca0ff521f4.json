  "title": "Sunak Wins  Race for U.K.  Prime Minister  ---  Former Treasury chief,  first person of Indian  heritage to lead nation,  faces dire fiscal woes  ----  By Max Colchester and Paul Hannon",
  "text": "<p>   LONDON -- Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, who warned that Liz Truss's economic plans for Britain were a \"fairy tale,\" won the contest to succeed her as prime minister on Monday, taking over the world's sixth-biggest economy at a time of deep financial and political turbulence. </p><p>   Mr. Sunak prevailed after his only remaining rival for the job, former Defense Minister Penny Mordaunt, said she would drop out of the contest. Mr. Sunak is expected to meet with King Charles III to be formally appointed prime minister on Tuesday, government officials said. </p><p>   Mr. Sunak's rise to the top job in the U.K. marks a historic moment. The grandson of Indian immigrants to Britain, the 42-year-old will be the first Hindu and the first person who isn't white to lead the U.K. He will also be the youngest prime minister since Robert Banks Jenkinson, Earl of Liverpool, in 1812. But his success will be determined by how well he manages the growing challenges to the U.K.'s economy as high inflation and a looming recession create a sense of growing despair. </p><p>   \"There is no doubt that we face profound economic challenges,\" Mr. Sunak said after his victory. \"We now need stability and unity.\" </p><p>   The former hedge-fund manager arrives with a mandate to bring calm to the ruling Conservative Party following a period of unparalleled chaos that will see the country run by three prime ministers in seven weeks. On Sunday night, his main rival for the job, former leader Boris Johnson, pulled out of the leadership race, saying he couldn't unite the party. </p><p>   On Monday, Mr. Sunak addressed Conservative Party lawmakers during a private meeting in the House of Commons and pledged to unify the party. He warned them that they faced \"an existential threat\" and would lose the next election if they didn't unite, said Simon Hoare, a Conservative lawmaker who was present. \"There are no second chances,\" Mr. Sunak told his party, Mr. Hoare said. </p><p>   Mr. Sunak takes over from Ms. Truss, who became the shortest-serving prime minister in British history after investors rejected her flagship economic program to stimulate the economy with tax cuts at a time of high inflation, causing the pound to sink to a record low and the Bank of England to intervene in bond markets to stabilize the price of U.K. government debt. </p><p>   On Monday, financial markets reacted positively to Mr. Sunak's victory. The pound rose slightly against the dollar, and yields on the government's benchmark 10-year debt fell sharply -- down 0.30 percentage point to 3.75% -- as investors bet that Mr. Sunak, an experienced Treasury official, will oversee cuts to public spending to shore up the nation's finances. </p><p>   The victory caps Mr. Sunak's second attempt to secure his place as prime minister. He campaigned over the summer to become U.K.'s leader but lost to Ms. Truss. During the campaign, Mr. Sunak criticized Ms. Truss's plan to borrow funds to cut taxes immediately. He said the U.K.'s inflation, which is currently at 10.1%, needed to be tackled first before any taxes were cut. </p><p>   \"Liz's plans are promising the Earth to everybody. I don't think you can have your cake and eat it,\" he said in August. </p><p>   Mr. Sunak lost, but his arguments later won the day. Ms. Truss was forced to roll back her plan to use unfunded tax cuts to spur economic growth. </p><p>   His government will face tough and unpopular decisions on spending. The U.K. Treasury is expected to outline plans on Oct. 31 to cut spending and potentially raise taxes to fill an estimated GBP 40 billion ($45.2 billion) deficit in public finances. </p><p>   His fiscal caution is likely to ease pressure on the Bank of England to raise its key interest rate sharply from 2.25%. Market expectations for the peak in the BOE's interest rate next year fell to 5% from 6% in the days after Ms. Truss's economic plan was axed. </p><p>   The broader outlook, however, is grim. Mr. Sunak will likely face a winter of discontent as inflation, fueled by rising energy costs from the war in Ukraine, increases faster than wages, and a possible recession takes hold that economists think could last a year. The early stages of his tenure are likely to be punctuated by worker strikes and questions about whether electricity blackouts will be needed as Russia restricts gas exports to Europe. </p><p>   In contrast to most other rich countries, the U.K.'s economy has yet to return to its prepandemic size. The U.K. economy grew very slightly in the three months through June, leaving it 0.2% smaller than in the final quarter of 2019, the last before the Covid-19 virus began to spread. </p><p>   \"The heightened political and economic uncertainty has caused business activity to fall at a rate not seen since the global financial crisis in 2009 if pandemic lockdown months are excluded,\" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. </p><p>   Mr. Sunak also faces another potentially more intractable challenge: uniting a party that has been at war with itself for years and has damaged its brand. The Conservative Party is at a record low in the polls against the opposition Labour Party. A recent poll by Opinium has 23% of Britons voting for the Conservatives versus 50% for Labour. Pollsters think the scale of that deficit, combined with the fact that the Tories will seek a record fifth term in office in the next election in 2024, is potentially insurmountable. </p><p>   In the wake of the U.K.'s departure from the European Union, conservative lawmakers have been split between embracing low regulation, a smaller government and free trade, or protectionism and more state intervention as an aging population puts more strain on public services. </p><p>   On Monday, Mr. Sunak pledged to listen to views from all wings of the party. One of Ms. Truss's senior ministers privately said he had no choice but to back Mr. Sunak \"or its oblivion for the party.\" </p><p>   Mr. Sunak represents an unusual mix of continuity and newness at the top of British politics. He grew up in Southern England to parents of Indian origin, his father was a doctor and his mother ran a pharmacy. Mr. Sunak attended the University of Oxford, then found a job at Goldman Sachs. He married Akshata Murty, the daughter of an Indian billionaire businessman. The pair met while Mr. Sunak was studying for an M.B.A. at Stanford University. He co-founded a hedge fund called Theleme Partners. </p><p>   As the wealthiest member of the House of Commons, Mr. Sunak could find himself in the uncomfortable position of explaining support for spending cuts that could make life harder for the working classes. Backers say he will argue that sound finances will allow Britain's economy to improve competitiveness to create broader prosperity down the road. </p><p></p>",
