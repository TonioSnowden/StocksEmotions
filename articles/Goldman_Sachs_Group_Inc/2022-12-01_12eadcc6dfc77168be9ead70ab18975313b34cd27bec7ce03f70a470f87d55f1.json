  "title": "Finance & Markets -- Commodities: Oil Futures, Forecasts Diverge on Prices --- Discrepancy shows how uncertainty and volatility are making projections difficult",
  "text": "<p>Brent crude futures for the next year currently range in price from $83.52 a barrel for December 2023 delivery to $86.97 for delivery in February 2023. Meanwhile, analysts at Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, UBS and the consulting firm Energy Aspects are forecasting, on average, a Brent price of $105.50 next year, implying that an investor buying, for example, August futures at $85.31 a barrel could earn a return of more than 23% in just seven months.</p><p>But there are lots of risks involved. Analysts' forecasts vary widely, mostly because of an especially cloudy outlook for next year's oil supply and demand. Some analysts are refraining from making price projections for next year until after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' next meeting on Dec. 4. Oil prices also have been exceptionally volatile since Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its potential impact on Russian oil supplies -- and with rising interest rates and China's continuing fight with Covid-19 threatening economic growth.</p><p>Wall Street struggles with forecasting everything from stock prices to bond yields even under the best of circumstances. Witness oil's 2014 crash, its early-pandemic slide into negative territory or its current 35% decline from March's peaks, none of which analysts anticipated.</p><p>But the current situation is even more unpredictable than usual. Highlighting the uncertainty, the oil options market currently signals a 46% probability that Brent oil delivered in August 2023 will settle more than $20 higher or lower than its current price.</p><p>\"There are so many geopolitical issues around oil that the head spins at times,\" said Hari Hariharan, chief investment officer of NWI Management, a global macro hedge fund.</p><p>Worries about a recession have sent prices tumbling since June, when Brent at one point fetched over $123 a barrel. They have taken their latest steep step down over the past few weeks, as renewed lockdowns risk delaying China's reopening, while rumors of a relatively permissive price cap on Russian oil has lifted expectations for the country's exports in the new year.</p><p>Yet analysts remain bullish for a host of reasons. Global oil stocks are at depleted levels. Coming European Union embargoes on Russian crude oil and refined products could still affect production. The Biden administration's releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve are tapering off. And most anticipate above-trend growth in global demand driven by China, India and other emerging markets conquering Covid and reopening their economies.</p><p>Russian supply and Chinese demand are the two biggest question marks driving the differences between forecasts.</p><p>\"The pent-up demand out of China is going to be enormous,\" said Amrita Sen, director of research for Energy Aspects. \"That could swing demand by at least a million barrels a day, and that could easily make the difference between an oil price forecast of $95 to $105 versus $120 to $130. Easily.\"</p><p>JPMorgan analysts lowered their forecast for Brent in 2023 this week by $8 a barrel to $90 after concluding that Russian production will fully normalize to prewar levels despite the coming embargoes. Meanwhile, Energy Aspects analysts are holding fast to their $123 forecast, in part because they see Russian production taking a hit of a million barrels a day by March of next year.</p><p>Futures prices also aren't forecasts, which helps explain the gap between them. Far more oil is sold via futures and other derivatives by oil producers looking to hedge their exposure than is bought by consumers such as airlines doing the opposite. Investors bridge this divide, so futures prices can reflect their assessments of value and risk, which might have little or no relation to oil fundamentals.</p><p>Goldman Sachs commodities analyst Callum Bruce said there has been a \"massive blowout\" in commodity positioning since the invasion, as traders have reacted to high volatility by reducing their bids for oil futures.</p><p>\"We think there's a large discount to the futures curve versus fair value\" for this reason, he said.</p><p>Some oil bulls, such as NWI Management's Mr. Hariharan, who currently has a relatively small bet that prices will climb, make other arguments for not taking bigger swings.</p><p>\"You need to have a modellable set of variables,\" he said. \"The more it gets into trying to figure out what's in [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's mind, or in [Chinese President Xi Jinping's] mind, the more it gets problematic.\"</p><p>Traders at banks and physical trading houses have been expecting higher prices this year, but thanks to Russia, China and the Federal Reserve, many got their \"wings clipped,\" by holding long positions, said oil-derivatives broker Brian Murphy of Tullett Prebon.</p><p>Most traders that Mr. Murphy talks to remain bullish. But they have largely exited from their positions as December approached with Wall Street's year-end bonuses.</p><p>\"Nobody wants to be the guy losing money in November and December,\" he said.</p>",
