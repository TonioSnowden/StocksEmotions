Others faced margin calls on derivatives contracts tied to long-term interest rates. Before the <strong>Bank of England </strong>stepped in yesterday, some were thought to be hours from insolvency.</p> <p>Rather than allow pensioners to face losses, the BoE announced a 13-day plan to buy gilts “on whatever scale is necessary” to restore order. </p> <p>It is not entirely clear whether order is what this government wants. In the six years since the country voted to leave the EU, Britain's political leaders have sometimes been likened to revolutionaries.</p> <p><strong>Vladimir Lenin</strong> would not have approved of their objectives, but the late Russian communist leader might have saluted the Tories' efforts to “heighten the contradictions” — that is, to make current conditions so untenable that a rupture becomes impossible to avoid.</p> <p>The FT's Robert Shrimsley <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6884fa0-5897-44e7-a990-354ac743571a\">has a less forgiving take</a>. “We are now watching the real-time implosion of the governing party . . . It's going to be a hell of a show, though sadly the tickets will prove expensive.”</p> <h1>Talk isn't so cheap after all</h1> <p>The message from US regulators has been heard loud and clear: anything you say can be held against you.</p> <p>On Tuesday, 11 Wall Street banks and brokers including <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> and <strong>Barclays</strong> agreed to pay more than $1.8bn in fines over charges of “widespread” and “longstanding” failures in their recordkeeping practices. <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> paid a $200mn fine for similar issues last December. </p> <p>Such transgressions include the use of encrypted messaging apps such as <strong>WhatsApp</strong> and <strong>Signal</strong>. The apps had become common ways for bankers to communicate with clients and each other over the course of the pandemic and are popular among a growing Gen-Z workforce.</p> <p>The fines, levied by the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission </strong>and<strong> Commodities and Futures Trading Commission</strong>, come after regulators opened an inquiry into employees communications and banks overall record-keeping capabilities last year that set off <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d766f618-ec3a-449d-8683-84b3f3a73b06\">a panic across Wall Street.</a></p> <p>Nervous dealmakers began lawyering up amid fears of personal liability and to prevent their employers accessing their private phones to check for work messages. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0caa0690-1020-40b8-83bf-1db27afe9ed6\"><strong>Credit Suisse</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4da0da94-3be5-40a0-abad-113396d443f9\"><strong>HSBC</strong></a> fired employees found to have used unapproved messaging applications with clients last year.</p> <p>Compliance departments are supposed to monitor all employee communications to uncover wrongdoing such as market manipulation and insider trading.</p> <p>The expensive slap on the wrist won't be the last headache for compliance departments.</p> <p>Though dealmaking pipelines have dried up for bankers, compliance and legal departments still enjoy a solid cadence of looming sanctions to resolve. </p> <p>Those include <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/540567ec-66b9-4858-bbe8-982e643c16fa\">a block trading probe</a> that has engulfed Morgan Stanley, as well as additional <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c771ad24-24ca-4002-ab8f-17719e4c32da\">potential fallout from the $10bn blow-up</a> of family office<strong> Archegos Capital Management</strong>. </p> <p>With the probes now resolved at a cost borne by shareholders and not executives, banks continue to face existential issues. </p> <p>They are struggling to adopt 21st-century communications for a workforce increasingly born in the digital age on their existing technological architecture that harks back to the 1970s and 1980s.&#xa0;</p> <p>Whether a rogue trader or a rogue texter, employees continue to short-circuit compliance barriers.</p> <h1>Low power mode: Britishvolt's drive for survival</h1> <p>Many things can disrupt a funding round: management changes, concerns over product, market turmoil, spiralling costs. </p> <p><strong>Britishvolt </strong>— the ambitious start-up that has painted itself as the UK car industry's great hope in the battery era — has witnessed the collision of all four.</p> <p>The debacle <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7cd57531-1c54-4d32-955c-d185dcea0621\">threatens the company's future</a> and the rich embarrassment of a UK government that made the business a flagship project, the FT's Peter Campbell, Harry Dempsey and Harriet Agnew report.</p> <p>Let's back up for a second.</p> <p>The company, founded in 2019, has garnered backing from investors including commodities group <strong>Glencore</strong> and has just shipped prototypes of its first in-house product to a handful of carmakers.</p> <p>But its latest series C investment round has been derailed by market conditions the company describes in its considered assessment as “wild”.</p> <p>As a result, it's now talking to the UK government about an advance on the £100mn grant it received — money that was only supposed to be paid out as it advanced with its plans to build a £3.8bn battery gigafactory in north-east England.</p> <p>Britishvolt is burning close to £3mn a month on staff costs alone after a hiring boom took its headcount close to 300.</p> <p>That may not be a vast sum by the standards of the cash incinerators of Silicon Valley, but it's certainly more than the company can afford given its flagship battery plant won't open — and begin generating revenues — until 2025 at the earliest. </p> <p>Efforts to convince potential investors that it is a grown-up business included replacing its mercurial founder <strong>Orral Nadjari</strong> with respected former <strong>Ford</strong> director <strong>Graham Hoare </strong>as its chief executive earlier this year.</p> <p>Investors really just want to see two things, though: working batteries and carmakers lining up to buy them.</p> <p>Both developments, Britishvolt promises, are just around the corner. One reader comment on the FT deep-dive offered this withering assessment: </p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <p><strong>Alex Mashinsky</strong>, the head of crypto lender <strong>Celsius Network</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84f1dcb7-e1e8-4e4f-b79b-5e641aceb44e?shareType=nongift\">resigned on Tuesday</a> with an apology to customers for the “difficult financial circumstances” the company's bankruptcy had left them in.</p> <p><strong>Burberry</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a662c8b8-40c1-4598-a0dd-44f6c2df6e71\">has replaced</a> its chief creative officer <strong>Riccardo Tisci</strong> with <strong>Daniel Lee</strong>, the former creative director at luxury fashion house <strong>Bottega Veneta</strong>, in the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/gsk-poaches-burberry-cfo-julie-brown-create-all-female-top-team-sky-news-2022-09-24/\">latest change</a> at the top of the British luxury fashion chain. </p> <p><strong>Tikehau Capital </strong>has appointed<strong> Sir Peter Westmacott</strong>, the former British ambassador to Turkey, France, and most recently the United States, as its UK chair.</p> <p><strong>Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson</strong> has hired<strong> Richard Powers</strong> as an antitrust partner in New York.
