  "text": "<p>The war in Ukraine has fueled big moves in stocks, commodities, currencies and bonds. For investors, analyzing the direction of the conflict, fast-changing Western sanctions on Russia and their effects on the global economy is challenging.</p><p>\"The market sentiment and the daily movement, and even the intraday movement, certainly has been whipsawed by the headlines surrounding the conflict in Ukraine,\" said David Sekera, Morningstar's chief U.S. market strategist.</p><p>The turbulence has sent stock indexes spiraling, erasing much of the gains of the past year. Both the Dow industrials and the Nasdaq—which has entered a bear market, falling more than 20% from November's peak—closed Tuesday at levels last seen roughly a year ago. Analysts said Wednesday's rally could be markets taking a pause.</p><p>\"People have to be very cautious here in chasing this dip, especially as these economic impacts and fears start affecting our economy as well through consumer confidence,\" said Jerry Braakman, president and chief investment officer of First American Trust.</p><p>A surge in oil prices, given new momentum by the U.S. embargo on Russian energy, has raised concerns that sustained inflation and lower economic growth could collide, which could lead to a 1970s stagflationary era. Major central banks were on track to begin tightening monetary policy before Russia invaded Ukraine. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that he planned to propose a quarter percentage-point rate increase at the central bank's meeting this month. Consumer-price index data released on Thursday morning will provide clues to investors about the pace of inflation.</p><p>Brent-crude futures, the international benchmark, declined $16.84 a barrel, or 13% to $111.14, the largest one-day percentage decline since April 2020. TheU.S. has banned imports of Russian oil and gas, while Russian President Vladimir Putin hasissued a decree banning exports of unspecified commodities and raw materials.</p><p>\"Whenever we get days where there is a respite in commodity prices, we're likely to see stocks react positively,\" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco.</p><p>The jump in equity markets spurred investors to pull back from haven assets Wednesday. The ICE U.S. Dollar index, which tracks the currency against a basket of others, lost 1%, on pace for largest one-day drop since March 2020. That pullback comes after a winning streak that pushed the greenback to its highest level in nearly two years. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes edged up to 1.944% from 1.870% Tuesday. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Gold prices, another asset that investors perceive as relatively safe, lost $54.20 a troy ounce, or 2.7%, to $1,985.90, the largest one-day dollar and percentage decline since June 2021. Trading in the nickel market was suspended for another day, following violent moves Tuesday that sent the metal surging to briefly top the $100,000-a-ton mark for the first time.</p><p>In New York trading, travel and textile stocks rallied. Cruise lines Carnival and Royal Caribbean added 8.8% and 5.6%, respectively. American Airlines Group and United Airlines Holdings added 5.9% and 8.3%, respectively. Tapestry Inc. gained 11%, on pace for its best session since April 2020.</p><p>Goldman Sachs on Monday raised its 2022 estimates for share buybacks in the S&amp;P 500 to $1 trillion. Jessica Bemer, portfolio manager at Easterly Investment Partners, said companies' strong balance sheets are providing investors comfort.</p><p>\"We know that the market is essentially operating in quicksand. We're not sure if today is the low or tomorrow is the low, but we do know that these companies will continue to exist and survive,\" she said.</p><p>Energy shares, which have outperformed this year, declined. Halliburton declined 5.2% and Marathon Oil fell 2.9%.</p><p>In the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin mounted a comeback after its recent slide, rising about 10% from its 5 p.m. ET closing price to trade around $42,396. On Wednesday, President Biden signed an executive order instructing agencies across the federal government to consider the creation of a U.S. digital currency.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 jumped 4.7%. Other European markets also rallied with Germany's blue-chip index DAX ending up 7.9%. Russia's stock market remained closed, though its currency trading was open. In the offshore market, the ruble edged slightly lower in volatile trading to around 128 rubles to the dollar. Pricing of Russia's currency has been choppy since the country imposed measures to stem its selloff, and Western banks have shunned Russian assets.</p><p>In Asia, stocks largely fell, tracking Wall Street's Tuesday session. Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 0.3%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.7%. The Shanghai Composite dropped 1.1%.</p><p>—Caitlin Ostroff, Joe Wallace and Stephanie Lai contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com and Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks End Losing Streak as S&amp;P 500 Rallies 2.6%</p>",
