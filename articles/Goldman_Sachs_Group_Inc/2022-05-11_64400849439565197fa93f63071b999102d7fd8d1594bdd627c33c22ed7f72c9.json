  "title": "Ukraine-Bound Smartphone Donation Ensnared in Tech Startup's Chapter 11; Bankrupt Hoyos Integrity's lender has asked a judge to let it foreclose on 10,000 phones immediately so it can donate some of them to Ukraine",
  "text": "<p>The software company said Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Hoyos filed for chapter 11 in April to try to stop a foreclosure auction of the phones. Chapter 11 puts a hold on all civil litigation, giving companies a breathing spell to prepare turnaround plans.</p><p>Allowing the phones to be foreclosed would provide \"societal benefit,\" Green Hills said in court documents, because before the bankruptcy filing, Hoyos and Green Hills were in discussions to send a batch of international phones to the government of Ukraine to \"assist in its efforts against the invasion by Russia.\"</p><p>Green Hills can \"provide the phones and back-end network support to Ukraine right now, without further delay,\" it said. Green Hills did not specify how many phones it intended to donate to Ukraine.</p><p>Hoyos is backed by Gary Cohn, a former top economic adviser to President Donald Trump and former president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p><p>Hoyos signed a license agreement in 2016 to use Green Hills' operating system in its ultra-secure mobile phones.</p><p>After Hoyos breached the license terms by violating the intellectual property and trademark agreements, Green Hills still lent Hoyos $4 million to buy 10,000 phones, the lender said. It later seized the phones after Hoyos defaulted on the loan in December, according to Green Hills' filing. But given Hoyos's chapter 11 petition, Green Hill can't move forward with the donation to Ukraine, the lender said.</p><p>Attorneys for Hoyos didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Green Hills said that lifting the stay wouldn't hurt Hoyos's restructuring because without Green Hills' technology, Hoyos can't monetize the 10,000 phones.</p><p>Becky Yerak contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Akiko Matsuda at akiko.matsuda@wsj.com</p>",
