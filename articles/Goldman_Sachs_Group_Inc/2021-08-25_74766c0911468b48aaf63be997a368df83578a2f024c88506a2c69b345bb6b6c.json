  "title": "Derby's Take: Economists Don't Expect Powell Taper Announcement This Week; Analysts don't think the Federal Reserve Chairman will announce the start of tapering the central bank's bonds purchases",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Powell will speak amid broad expectations the Fed will soon be able to pull back on its $120 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage bond purchases, as the job market continues to make a solid pace recovering what it lost during the Covid crisis's early stages.</p><p>Recently released meeting minutes from the Fed's late July policy gathering showed that officials believed then that asset buying could start to slow down—\"taper\" in market parlance—by the end of this year. That view is roughly in alignment with that of big banks and money funds, which told the Fed ahead of the July Federal Open Market Committee meeting that they saw the taper process starting in January and ending in late 2022.</p><p>Fed officials have repeatedly said they would signal a slowdown of the purchases as early and as clearly as they can, in a bid to not repeat the 2013 taper tantrum. Then, markets reacted chaotically to the prospect of slowing the asset-buying stimulus.</p><p>Fed leaders often use the Jackson Hole research conference for announcing important shifts. And last year was one of those times. Then, Mr. Powell used his remarks to lay out a new central bank monetary policy strategy that would allow inflation to overshoot the Fed's 2% target to make up for past shortfalls, in a bid to help the job market be stronger than it would otherwise be.</p><p>But this year, analysts don't think Mr. Powell will drop the hammer on the tapering announcement.</p><p>\"We think the [Federal Open Market Committee's] intention is to formally announce the start of tapering at the November FOMC meeting if all goes well by then, and to taper at a pace of $15bn per meeting,\" Goldman Sachs economists said in a note released Monday. As for Friday's remarks, \"we expect Chair Powell to acknowledge both the strong employment gains in recent months and the downside risks posed by the Delta variant,\" the bank note said, adding \"this would keep expectations on track for a potential September warning and November taper announcement, but would carefully avoid locking the FOMC in to that timeline.\"</p><p>Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors, also agrees a November taper announcement appears likely, bypassing the Jackson Hole remarks. He believes the Fed is still working to establish an internal consensus among policy makers, many of whom have staked out all manner of positions on pulling back on asset buying. Mr. Duy says the resurgent Covid crisis is also weighing on the timing of a stimulus drawdown, and that the uncertainty of how the latest wave will take place will drive the Fed to play for more time.</p><p>\"The last-minute decision to abandon an in-person format at Jackson Hole for another all-virtual event underscores the ongoing risk to the economy,\" Mr. Duy wrote on Monday. \"Incoming information suggests a consensus position will eventually fall on a November taper announcement; renewed concerns about the Delta variant likely take September off the table for an actual taper,\" he said.</p><p>Economists at Cornerstone Macro agree the Covid situation prevents Mr. Powell from going forward on a taper call, but they at least expect him to hint in that direction. \"We expect Powell to reiterate the main message from the July FOMC minutes, namely that, as a base case, tapering is likely to start late this year,\" the firm said Tuesday. They don't see much of a market reaction as the likely path of the Fed squares with what markets expect and have priced in.</p><p>The Fed itself has offered little in the way of clues. Mr. Powell's speech is titled \"The Economic Outlook\" and the conference title is \"Macroeconomic Policy in an Uneven Economy.\"</p><p>If Mr. Powell is vague in his speech about the Fed policy outlook, some of his colleagues may continue to contribute their own takes. There are usually a range of television and media interviews with central bankers other than the chair that happen around the Jackson Hole conference, and over recent weeks and months, these policy makers haven't been shy about expressing what they want for the asset-buying effort.</p><p>Write to Michael S.
