  "text": "<p>ICBC, one of China's largest state-owned banks, said the venture will help it provide more diversified and professional wealth-management services and would improve the bank's ability to serve the real economy.</p><p>In China, wealth-management businesses run by banks typically sell investment products to a range of individuals. Goldman on Tuesday cited its own research estimating that investible assets held by Chinese households could surpass $70 trillion by 2030. About 60% of that total could be allocated to nondeposit products including securities, mutual funds and wealth-management products, the firm said.</p><p>Goldman said the new venture has received preliminary approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, and it intends to develop a range of investment products for the China market.</p><p>That would include \"quantitative investment strategies, cross-border products and innovative solutions in alternatives,\" Goldman said.</p><p>Goldman has sought to expand its presence in the world's second-largest economy. Last December, it applied to take full control of Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Co. by acquiring the 49% share of the venture it didn't own. Goldman Sachs was the first global bank to seek full ownership of its securities business in China.</p><p>Other global financial firms have also been moving to expand wealth-management offerings in China, which for years placed ownership restrictions on foreign financial institutions. A January 2020 trade pact between Washington and Beijing promised greater access to China's financial sector for American institutions.</p><p>In March this year, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. agreed to pay $410 million for a minority stake in a leading wealth-management business owned by China Merchants Bank. That deal marked the first time a Chinese bank has opened up its wealth-management subsidiary to a foreign strategic investor. J.P. Morgan Asset Management is separately awaiting approval to take full ownership of its fund management joint venture in China.</p><p>Earlier this month, BlackRock Inc., the world's largest money manager, received a green light from China's banking regulator to commence a wealth management joint venture with a unit of the state-owned China Construction Bank and Singapore's investment company Temasek. BlackRock is separately preparing to start selling mutual funds to individual investors in China, via a wholly owned business there.</p>",
