  "title": "Investors Are Backing Away From South Korea; Challenges for the country include a won that has weakened to levels last hit during the global financial crisis",
  "text": "<p>For South Korea, \"capital outflows will be a serious issue,\" said Kim Il-koo, chief economist at Hanwha Investment &amp; Securities. Further outflows would put fresh pressure on the currency, stocks and bonds. That would make commodity imports even costlier in local-currency terms and raise the cost of funding for businesses.</p><p>The dollar has gained nearly 17% against the won so far this year through Monday, outpacing a roughly 13% rise in the broad WSJ Dollar Index. On Monday, $1 bought about 1,390 won, after reaching a 13-year high of 1,399 won last week.</p><p>Many of South Korea's headaches are widely shared: Investors are pulling back from countries that don't offer investors substantially higher interest rates, adjusted for inflation, than the U.S. And currencies such as the British pound, the euro, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan have tumbled to multiyear or multidecade lows.</p><p>At the same time, high raw-materials costs are stoking inflation for commodity importers, and China's slowdown is hurting trading partners across Asia.</p><p>But South Korea has some distinctive problems of its own, making the tumbling won even more unwelcome. In particular, high household and corporate debt levels limit the ability of its central bank to tighten policy aggressively to quell inflation and bolster the currency.</p><p>In addition, there are longer-term questions about the country's heavy reliance on exports, particularly with its largest trading partner, China. And Seoul hasn't done enough to persuade index provider MSCI Inc. that it merits developed-market statusâ€”an upgrade that Goldman Sachs analysts have estimated could attract more than $44 billion.</p><p>Mr. Kim at Hanwha also pointed to worsening trade data and corporate-profit margins. And he said efforts by China and the U.S. to foster domestic production of key products such as semiconductors and batteries were likely to put pressure on prices for these goods.</p><p>Foreigners own the smallest share of the country's stock market since the depths of the global financial crisis, at 26.2% of total market value as of August, official data show. As of July, foreigners had withdrawn $12.5 billion from South Korean stocks in the previous six months, taking net withdrawals to nearly $43 billion since the onset of the pandemic.</p><p>After inflation hit a 24-year high of 6.3% in July, the Bank of Korea last month raised its benchmark interest rate to 2.5%. But its policy rates remain far below those in many other emerging markets, and it would be hard for the central bank to tighten policy considerably without causing domestic financial strain.</p><p>Household debt is above 104% of gross domestic product, according to the Institute of International Finance. That is the highest among 36 major economies, the banking industry group's data show.</p><p>Investors pulled funds from global emerging markets for five straight months through July, according to IIF data. That is on par with 2015, when a depreciation of China's yuan rattled global investors, or the 2013 \"taper tantrum\" sparked by tighter Fed policy. The figures exclude China, an economy so large that investors sometimes assess it separately.</p><p>Meanwhile, demand for high-technology products such as semiconductors is slowing, hitting economies that revolve around sophisticated exports, such as South Korea and Taiwan.</p><p>In August, South Korea recorded its worst trade deficit on record, while technology exports declined for the first time in more than two years. Similarly, in Taiwan semiconductor sales are slackening. There, capital outflows have totaled $43 billion so far this year, and the New Taiwan dollar has dropped about 12% against the U.S. currency.</p><p>Still, market-watchers say Asian economies learned lessons from the region's financial crisis, making them better prepared for this year's tumult. For instance, while floating exchange rates have fallen sharply, that is preferable to defending unsustainable dollar pegs.</p><p>In addition, countries' foreign-exchange \"reserves are larger, current-account deficits are smaller, and their net investment positions are far better,\" said Andrew Sheng, a former central banker with the Hong Kong and Malaysian monetary authorities.</p><p>In Seoul's case, the financial-market ructions could boost the case for changes to help secure an upgrade to developed-market status. These could include lifting a restriction on short selling, or betting against, smaller stocks and further liberalizing trading in the won.</p><p>Some investors draw a contrast between the current challenges facing South Korea and its neighbors, and the region's longer-term growth prospects.</p><p>\"What is likely to grow faster in the next 10 to 20 years? It's Asia. But all of these headwinds continue to weigh on these stocks that I own,\" said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, which manages about $1.4 trillion in assets.</p><p>\"If the macro overhangs were to clear up, these companies would do very, very well,\" said Mr. Slimmon. \"But I could have said the same thing nine months ago. So I'm sitting here very patiently, but it's frustrating.\"</p><p>Investors Are Backing Away From South Korea</p>",
