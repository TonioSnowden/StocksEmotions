  "title": "DWAC, the Trump Social-Media SPAC, Surges: What to Know; The firm is promoting itself as having a large market opportunity in presenting an alternative to what it views as the liberal-minded media establishment",
  "text": "<p>Hundreds of SPACs have been launched in the past two years, tapping into two market trends: investor enthusiasm to buy anything, and a flood of private startups looking to hit the public markets.</p><p>Why is DWAC going crazy?</p><p>]The SPAC's shares closed at $94.20 on Friday, an increase of more than 800% since the merger announcement. It continued to rise in trading as of midday Monday. The stock is surging in part because it is linked to Mr. Trump, one of the major figures on social media, and this seems to have spurred a wave of individual-investor interest. Day traders on platforms like Reddit have posted photos of their quick fortunes, inspiring others to jump on board, some analysts said. The firm is also promoting itself as having a large market opportunity in presenting an alternative to what it views as the liberal-minded media establishment.</p><p>How is Donald Trump involved?</p><p>Unclear. He is listed as chairman (a notoriously vague corporate title) of Trump Media &amp; Technology Group, which is merging with DWAC and has plans to launch a conservative-leaning social network called Truth Social.</p><p>Who Is Patrick Francis Orlando?</p><p>While plenty of well-known corporate and political insiders have launched SPACs, such as former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President Gary Cohn and former Honeywell International Inc. Chief Executive Dave Cote, Patrick Orlando isn't among them. According to securities filings he is the chief executive of Benessere Capital, a Miami investment firm he founded in 2012. His first SPAC, Yunhong International, went public earlier this year and signed a deal to acquire energy transportation solutions company Giga Energy, but that deal was called off in September.</p><p>What is Truth Social?</p><p>The Twitter-like platform—users can post \"truths\" and \"re-truths\"—is one leg of a planned media empire that would compete with the likes of Netflix and CNN, according to a company presentation this week. The presentation doesn't make it clear when the planned platform would go live.</p><p>What's Next?</p><p>The Digital World SPAC will have to publicly release an S-4 regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing will detail the merger, including financial information and the ownership structure of Mr. Trump's new venture. Regulators will then review the documents, before an official shareholder vote on the deal. At that time, Digital World SPAC investors could pull their money out.</p><p>If the merger is approved, Trump Media &amp; Technology Group will replace Digital World in the stock market and begin trading under that name.</p><p>This article may be updated.</p><p>Write to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com and Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com</p><p>DWAC, the Trump Social-Media SPAC, Surges: What to Know</p>",
