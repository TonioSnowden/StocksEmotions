  "text": "<h2>Third Point is pushing Shell to split&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Shell </strong>chair <strong>Andrew Mackenzie</strong> might be having a case of <em>déjà vu</em>. </p> <p>In 2017, while he was chief executive of <strong>BHP Billiton</strong>, the company was targeted by one of the fiercest activist investors on Wall Street — <strong>Paul Singer</strong>'s <strong>Elliott Management</strong>. The firm wanted BHP to spin off its oil business. </p> <p>Now, just months after he took over as Shell chair, the Anglo-Dutch group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4fc6926-e991-43ca-9ac8-3b1478c23dd5\">is under pressure </a>from the activist investor <strong>Third Point</strong> to break itself up. </p> <p><strong>Daniel Loeb</strong>'s $20bn-in-assets hedge fund, which is among the most prolific activists, has built a stake in Shell worth close to $750m and is pushing the group to split itself into multiple companies. </p> <p>According to Third Point, Shell has “too many competing stakeholders” that are pulling it in “too many different directions”. The New York-based hedge fund has suggested that the company split its “legacy” arm, focused on oil and gas, and set up a standalone renewables business. </p> <p>“As the saying goes, you can't be all things to all people,” the firm wrote in an investor letter. </p> <p>The move from Third Point comes less than six months after Shell <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/340501e2-e0cd-4ea5-b388-9af0d9a74ce2\">was ordered to speed up plans</a> to cut greenhouse gas emissions by a court in The Hague, and just a day before chief executives of oil majors are due to testify in Congress on whether they misled the public over the role played by fossil fuels in causing climate change. </p> <p>Some investors are sceptical over whether splitting Shell up will have much environmental impact. But others say it could be a watershed moment as more legacy oil companies give in to investor demands to transition to greener energy. </p> <p>For anyone wondering whether Shell, which has a market capitalisation of almost $200bn, needs to listen to an investor with a less than 1 per cent stake, we'd ask you to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebfdf67d-cbce-40a5-bb29-d361377dea7a\">cast your minds back</a> to the successful activist campaign <strong>Engine No 1</strong> ran against <strong>ExxonMobil</strong>, Shell's US rival. </p> <p>For his part, Mackenzie pushed back against Elliott's demands at BHP. It will be interesting to see how he reacts to Third Point. </p> <h2>The credit market hits a new beat</h2> <p>Perhaps the most iconic quote of the financial crisis came from <strong>Chuck Prince</strong>, the then-chief executive of<strong> Citigroup</strong>. </p> <p>“When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will get complicated,” Prince <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80e2987a-2e50-11dc-821c-0000779fd2ac\">told</a> the FT in July 2007. “As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance. We're still dancing.”</p> <p>Just over a year later, Citi needed to be bailed out. The subsequent decade on Wall Street, marked by near-zero interest rates, was dominated by the rise of publicly traded alternative asset managers, which built enormous credit businesses for yield-starved investors.</p> <p>Middle-market buyout firms and companies securitising everything from pharmaceutical royalties to restaurant franchises now turn to the lending businesses of <strong>Blackstone Group</strong>, <strong>Apollo Global Management </strong>and <strong>KKR</strong>.</p> <p>These alternative firms are now dancing as the music plays. Quite literally. The FT's Anna Nicolaou and Antoine Gara <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83753cb0-0007-4420-a9a9-99a3b9b72778\">explain</a> why the hot new product in alternatives is music. </p> <p>Firms have spent billions of dollars this year to purchase some of the most valuable music catalogues in the world. A KKR-led group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c46aed3-bf84-42e9-b9d1-28d580a0161f\">agreed to buy</a> a song catalogue that included hits from <strong>The Weeknd</strong> for $1.1bn.</p> <p>Earlier in October, Blackstone <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f9ce243-d77a-44f6-a615-384eda335b42\">struck</a> a partnership with <strong>Hipgnosis</strong>, led by the music mogul <strong>Merck Mercuriadis</strong>. Meanwhile, Apollo has committed up to $1bn to back <strong>HarbourView Equity Partners</strong>.</p> <p>Blackstone's efforts are led by <strong>Qasim Abbas</strong>, a senior figure in its Tactical Opportunities Group. <strong>Jenny Box</strong>, a KKR partner who joined from the credit manager <strong>Oaktree Capital</strong> in 2019, led the firm's recent acquisition of <strong>Kobalt</strong>, which included the Weeknd catalogue. </p> <p>Apollo's efforts are done through a joint venture with <strong>Sherrese Clarke Soares</strong>, founder of the music buyer HarbourView Equity. She previously founded a structured solutions platform at <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> dedicated to entertainment, media and sports assets.</p> <p>Firms are attracted to music because of growing royalties from audio streaming services such as <strong>Spotify</strong> and the ability to “work assets” by uncovering monetisation opportunities. But the increasingly crowded field is leading to rising prices and falling yields. </p> <p>In recent years specialist funds had been paying three to four times the historic value for music publishing assets. Hipgnosis has on average paid 14.8 times songs' historic annual income to acquire the rights to hits by The Pretenders and Bon Jovi. KKR paid almost 20 times the asset's historic annual income, according to people with knowledge of the situation.</p> <p>“It's mind-numbing,” said <strong>Barry Massarsky</strong> of <strong>Massarsky Consulting</strong>, who has valued many of the recently announced deals, of the rising valuations. </p> <p>If, due to rising interest rates or an unforeseen economic contagion, liquidity in credit markets does thin out, the music really will stop.</p> <h2>The Weinbergs of Wall Street</h2> <p>Two Weinbergs are the CEOs of publicly traded investment banks. But neither, ironically, are the skippers of <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>. </p> <p><strong>Evercore</strong> announced this week that <strong>John Weinberg</strong> would become sole chief executive early next year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96230b93-722b-4e5c-a394-6e778f0aab62\">when his current co-CEO</a>, <strong>Ralph Schlosstein</strong> retires. </p> <p>John's cousin, <strong>Peter Weinberg</strong>, is the co-founder and CEO of <strong>Perella Weinberg</strong>, a firm that just listed its shares via a Spac merger.</p> <p>The Weinberg family, up until recent years, had been synonymous with creating the modern Goldman. <strong>Sidney Weinberg</strong>, who first started as a janitor at the firm, led Goldman from 1930 to 1969. His son John was boss between 1976 and 1990. Both Peter and the younger John had long careers at the bank.</p> <p>Evercore hired John Weinberg in 2016 with the expectation he would ultimately lead the firm that <strong>Roger Altman</strong> had founded in 1995. </p> <p>In the intervening years, Weinberg helped beef up Evercore's ranks, including with several other Goldman alumni. </p> <p>The hiring spree, just before the M&amp;A market exploded, proved to be a canny move. </p> <p>On Wednesday, Evercore announced that it had reached nearly $2bn of deal revenue just in the first three quarters of 2021, a figure that puts it toe-to-toe with the bulge bracket firms and well ahead of <strong>Lazard</strong>. Goldman Sachs has probably noticed as well.</p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Canadian National</strong> appointed <strong>Jo-ann dePass Olsovsky</strong>, chief information officer of <strong>Salesforce</strong>, to its board. The nomination of Olsovsky, who also worked at <strong>BNSF Railway</strong> in the past, comes <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d347672-1c8e-4a5a-9e02-6a3cd445f038\">a week after</a> CN's chief executive <strong>Jean-Jacques Ruest</strong> said he would step down after pressure from UK hedge fund manager <strong>Chris Hohn</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>HSBC</strong> has hired <strong>Sarah Wiggins</strong>, a partner at <strong>Linklaters</strong>, to a new role as vice-chair in its global banking division. Wiggins worked for 31 years at Linklaters and is the latest lawyer-turned-banker in London.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>GSK</strong> is appointing Johns Hopkins medical professor <strong>Harry Dietz</strong> to its board from the start of next year.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Salad-As-A-Service</strong> Meet the latest hot SaaS company: restaurant chain Sweetgreen.
