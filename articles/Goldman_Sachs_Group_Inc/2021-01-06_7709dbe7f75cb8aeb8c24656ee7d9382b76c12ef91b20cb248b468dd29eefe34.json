  "title": "Former Goldman Sachs partner Richard Sharp to become BBC chairman",
  "text": "<p>Richard Sharp, a former Goldman Sachs partner and adviser to the UK's chancellor, is to be made chairman of the BBC in a move suggesting Boris Johnson's government is taking a more restrained approach to the public service broadcaster. </p> <p>The nomination, which was announced on Tuesday, came after Mr Johnson's favoured candidate for the post, Charles Moore, the former Daily Telegraph editor and a fierce critic of the BBC, ruled himself out of the running last year.</p> <p>Mr Sharp's selection as the government's “preferred candidate” was greeted with some relief within the BBC. Senior executives had feared the appointment of an arch critic such as Lord Moore could hamstring the corporation and its new director-general, Tim Davie. </p> <p>Mr Sharp said: “The BBC is at the heart of British cultural life and I'm honoured to be offered the chance to help guide it through the next chapter in its history.”</p> <p>The non-executive chairman is responsible for overseeing an “independent” BBC, and ensuring it fulfils its public commitments under the BBC charter. It is the first of a wave of new appointments to the BBC board, which could potentially reorientate priorities at the top of the corporation. </p> <p>Negotiations are also expected to begin this year on the level of the TV licence fee, a crucial discussion that will run in parallel to various reviews into the role of public service broadcasting and its regulatory framework. The fee is £157.50 a year and a licence is required to watch live TV on any channel or any BBC programmes on iPlayer, the corporation's on-demand service. </p> <p>Mr Johnson's government has had notably tetchy relations with the BBC, questioning alleged bias in its coverage, its funding model and the criminal penalties that back up collection of the licence fee.</p> <p>Mr Davie has steadied relations with Downing Street since taking over in September, in part by taking a tough approach against “opinionated” staff whose views were undermining the BBC's impartiality. Government insiders say plans to decriminalise non-payment of the licence fee have been shelved — an important reprieve for the corporation. </p> <p>Mr Sharp does not have a background in broadcasting and has said little in public about the BBC. But he brings extensive experience in business and in the boardroom, as well as close ties to the top of government that could prove crucial in steering negotiations on the future of the BBC. </p> <p>Oliver Dowden, culture secretary, said Mr Sharp was “exactly the chair the BBC needs right now”. “I'm confident he will drive forward reforms to the BBC to ensure it impartially reflects and serves the needs of all parts of the UK, and evolves to remain a global success,” he said. </p> <p>A Conservative party donor who was previously chancellor Rishi Sunak's boss at Goldman Sachs, Mr Sharp has been giving his former subordinate unpaid advice on the economic response to the pandemic. </p> <p>He is a director of the Centre for Policy Studies, a Thatcherite free-market think-tank that has been critical of the BBC in the past. Friends of Mr Sharp said he was unlikely to push for a radical overhaul of the broadcaster or its commitment to political neutrality, but may seek to steer its output towards core public service responsibilities. </p> <p>“Richard is the sort of guy who thinks the BBC should do more opera and high culture, since it is public service broadcasting no one else covers. But he won't want to turn it into a rightwing talking shop,” one ally said. </p> <p>Mr Sharp's closest brush with broadcasting was perhaps during his time running Goldman Sachs' European private equity arm, which was part of a failed approach for ITV in 2006. </p> <p>Charles Allen, the then chief executive of ITV, lived two doors from Mr Sharp in west London. “He is a bright guy and an interesting appointment,” said Lord Allen. “He will bring a different perspective.”</p> <p>With almost three decades of experience in finance, Mr Sharp will fit the mould for BBC chairs, who have often had a City background. He will succeed David Clementi, another former banker who served as deputy governor of the Bank of England, when he steps down in February. The appointment was first reported by Sky News.</p> <p>Under the rules for the appointment, as a preferred candidate Mr Sharp will testify next week before the House of Commons select committee for digital, culture, media and sport. While the committee can make a recommendation on the appointment, any vote would be non-binding. </p> <p>Mr Sharp has served on the Bank of England's financial policy committee and was a member of Mr Johnson's board of economic advisers when he was mayor of London. He is also a former chair of the Royal Academy of Arts.</p><p>Source: Alex Barker and Sebastian Payne in London 2021 'Former Goldman Sachs partner Richard Sharp to become BBC chairman' FT.com 6 January.
