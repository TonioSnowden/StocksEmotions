The group had been willing to give majority control of Toshiba to domestic investors to make its $20bn bid acceptable to the Japanese government.</p> <p>The machinations come against an unhappy backdrop at Toshiba, which the FT's Leo Lewis chronicles <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4849c202-7b2f-4a11-8d08-673d2870d5b7\">here</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>That includes a profit-padding scandal, Toshiba's US nuclear business <strong>Westinghouse</strong> filing for bankruptcy protection, the fire sale of its prized memory chip business, and an emergency share issuance that brought activists on to the scene.&#xa0;</p> <p>That brings us to last month, when Toshiba's management suffered a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aadf2bce-0645-46a9-b863-25fdfc79b83f\">humiliating defeat </a>in a clash with investors.&#xa0;</p> <p>Read up on the back story with this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7be2424e-6c9a-454e-8afb-c0376bc66106\">deep dive</a> from the weekend, by DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Leo Lewis and Kana Inagaki.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Grab: super app strikes super Spac deal</h2> <p>Just when it looked like things were going quiet in Spac-land, as exhausted investors took time to digest the enormous amount of dealmaking this year, we received news of the biggest blank-cheque merger to date.</p> <p><strong>Grab</strong>, the so-called Singaporean “super app” that provides everything from food delivery to digital payments, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a44185aa-51f4-443a-895f-16dd853e1d77\">going public</a> in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company launched by the Silicon Valley group <strong>Altimeter</strong>, which values the company at almost $40bn.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>For perspective, Grab, which is backed by Japan's<strong> SoftBank</strong>, was last valued at $16bn in a private fundraising in 2019. The deal will see Grab raise more than $4bn in fresh funding, which will be led by a $750m cash injection from Altimeter.</p> <p>There are already debates about whether Grab is worth the hefty valuation. Nevertheless, its 39-year-old founder <strong>Anthony Tan</strong>, a descendant of Malaysia's wealthiest families, has won SoftBank founder <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong>'s stamp of approval. Read the FT's profile on the charismatic entrepreneur <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41b26841-b88d-4f9d-9da2-b1b8f2c6c734\">here</a>.</p> <p>Like most food delivery companies, Grab has experienced significant growth during the pandemic, with many people locked indoors and unable to eat out. But the business is yet to turn a profit and has burnt through cash at a rapid pace.&#xa0;</p> <p>The money has largely been spent on transforming Grab from south-east Asia's answer to Uber into an application that offers digital banking services to a hugely underserved population. That indicates the company has huge potential for growth. But it's not the only one.&#xa0;</p> <p>Grab is locked in a bitter rivalry with<strong> Gojek</strong>, another SoftBank-backed app. Both have spent huge amounts of cash to prove their dominance in south-east Asia.</p> <p>Most of the money is spent trying to acquire customers who will stick around in the long run, but the barrier to entry is low and when rivals offer cheaper prices, customers don't tend to stay loyal.&#xa0;</p> <p>This all comes as regulators in the US start to take a closer look at Spac fundraising and dealmaking, particularly the lofty projections touted by young companies.</p> <p>So it hasn't gone unnoticed that Altimeter has opted to lock-up its founder shares for three years. Typically, Spac founders have to wait only about six months before being allowed to sell out.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Altimeter/Grab deal also offers some good lessons for budding Spac sponsors: you don't have to raise a huge pot of cash to strike a big deal and, after a year-long boom, it's worthwhile to look outside the US for targets.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Black's fact-finding mission at Apollo</h2> <p><strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> has made billions flipping companies. Now, the group's flair for refurbishment has turned within.</p> <p>The unexpected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1390c33e-bae4-4a6d-9bcc-7af1ee5b09d5\">early departure</a> of its founder <strong>Leon Black</strong> last month, following a report on the extent of his financial ties to the late paedophile <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>, was just the first thwack of the hammer.</p> <p>His successor <strong>Marc Rowan</strong> has wasted no time in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b1a1c63-5920-4876-829f-e3f1552a3903\">remodelling</a> Apollo into a hunkering financial institution resembling more bank than buyout shop. Former chair of the US <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission Jay Clayton</strong> has replaced Black as chair, bringing several new independent directors in tow.&#xa0;</p> <p>Meanwhile <strong>Robert Kraft</strong>, the owner of the<strong> New England Patriots</strong> football team, has stepped down from the Apollo board after a seven-year tenure.</p> <p>But despite all these changes, one familiar face made an appearance at Apollo in late March.</p> <p>Black quietly attended a meeting of top executives just days after he resigned from all of his leadership positions, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5da69898-fd50-4c45-87ca-f913b9da1519\">sources told</a> DD's Mark Vandevelde and Sujeet Indap, in an effort to dispel investors' concerns over his ties to Epstein.</p> <p>The gathering was redesignated an “informational meeting” to accommodate Black, a large shareholder, but no longer a member of the executive committee.</p> <p>As Apollo hastens to redefine itself in the post-Black era, its mission will be further complicated by the fact that its founder (in this case quite literally) remains a part of the conversation.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>BNP Paribas </strong>named former <strong>HSBC </strong>M&amp;A specialist <strong>Jan Masek</strong> as its head of advisory in Switzerland. He will be based in Zurich.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Wilson Sonsini </strong>has hired <strong>Josh Beser</strong> as a partner. He joins the firm's New York office from direct-to-consumer travel brand <strong>Away</strong>, where he was general counsel.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Greenhill</strong> has hired <strong>Jennifer Fritzsche </strong>as a managing director. She joins from <strong>Wells Fargo</strong>. She will work with<strong> Pieter-Jan Bouten</strong>, previously head of Greenhill UK, who has been promoted to head of telecom and digital infrastructure.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Latham &amp; Watkins </strong>has hired <strong>Carles Esteva Mosso</strong> as a partner in Brussels and <strong>Pedro de Rojas</strong> as a partner in Madrid. They join from the <strong>European Commission's Directorate General for Competition</strong> and <strong>Linklaters</strong>, respectively.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>S Sundareswaran</strong>, Morgan Stanley's head of M&amp;A in India, will leave the bank at the end of June to join <strong>Alta Capital</strong> as a partner. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/morgan-stanley-india-m-a-head-is-said-to-join-alta-capital?sref=OziMsGoK\">More here</a> from Bloomberg.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>White &amp; Case</strong> has hired <strong>Katie Hicks</strong> and <strong>Tim Sheddick</strong> as partners in London. They join from <strong>Shearman &amp; Sterling</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Home court advantage </strong>Sports betting would have been unthinkable in the state of New York just a year ago. But revenue holes blown open by the pandemic (and sexual harassment claims against Governor Andrew Cuomo) have offered politicians a new perspective, and investors are bracing for a windfall.
