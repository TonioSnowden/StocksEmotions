  "title": "Chile's Presidential Election Pits Young Versus Old in Key Vote for Economy; Vote highlights generational gap as younger voters seek sweeping changes and older ones want status quo",
  "text": "<p>On Sunday, voters in Latin America's most affluent country are casting ballots following a campaign that has highlighted a generational divide pitting the young against the old. The vote comes in what has been the most consequential and polarizing election since Chile's return to democracy after Gen. Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship three decades ago.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Who do you think will win in Chile's presidential election, and why? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Whoever wins will be hamstrung by a divided congress, political analysts say. They will also face the highest inflation in a decade and a sharp economic slowdown in the months ahead after an 11% rebound this year driven by a fiscal stimulus equivalent to 14% of GDP. The cloudy outlook led the peso to fall 16% so far this year against the dollar.</p><p>Those constraints reduce the risk of Mr. Boric's victory to the economy, which has caused investor jitters, says Alvaro Vivanco, head of emerging markets strategy at investment bank NatWest Markets.</p><p>\"Even if he wanted to push a more-radical agenda I think it is going to be very difficult,\" Mr. Vivanco says.</p><p>Mr. Kast's economic program is better-received by investors. But his election would also raise concerns about his ability to govern if it sparks more protests and social turmoil, says Alberto Ramos, head of Latin American economics at Goldman Sachs.</p><p>\"Governability could be very complicated for him and maintaining social peace,\" Mr. Ramos says. \"Those challenges are probably bigger on his side than the other side.\"</p><p>Young voters born after the dictatorship who want more funding for social programs and state control of the economy support Mr. Boric, a tattooed congressman who became prominent as a student protest leader a decade ago. His rival, Mr. Kast, 55, is attracting voters like Mr. Macias, who was unnerved by violent protests two years ago and fears Mr. Boric would sink an economic model that allowed him to escape poverty.</p><p>As a boy in the late 1970s, Mr. Macias helped his family make ends meet by picking grapes on a farm on the outskirts of Santiago. Today, he has a small transport business that allowed him to put his children through university and vacation in the Dominican Republic.</p><p>\"We want an economy that provides three meals a day and tranquility,\" Mr. Macias says. \"Boric doesn't provide businesses with security to continue that path.\"</p><p>The candidates have filled a void left by the collapse of traditional, moderate parties. For three decades, center-left and center-right presidents were the stewards, guided by fiscal discipline and global trade. Poverty plummeted in the world's biggest copper producer.</p><p>The stability, rare in much of Latin America, was punctured in 2019 when high-school students protesting a small hike in subway fares sparked mass protests that exposed years of pent up anger over the cost of living, low pensions and shoddy public services. About 30 people died as churches were torched and grocery stores ransacked. Graffiti-covered stores around Plaza Italia, epicenter of protests here, are still closed.</p><p>Many of those who protested are now giving Mr. Boric the edge. Pollster Cadem says he had a 20-point advantage over Mr. Kast with voters ages 18 to 35. In the overall population, Mr. Boric earlier this month held a slight lead in the polls.</p><p>\"Boric needs young people to show up in large numbers if he is to win the election,\" says Jennifer Pribble, a political scientist and Latin America expert at the University of Richmond.</p><p>Fabiana Segovia, a 21-year-old university student, worries Mr. Kast will roll back social rights like same sex marriage, which was just signed into law. She likes Mr. Boric, pointing to his promises to raise the minimum wage.</p><p>With centrist candidates defeated in a first round of voting in November, the two who emerged victorious for Sunday's runoff—Messrs. Kast and Boric—have moderated their messages to attract voters.</p><p>Mr. Kast, a Roman Catholic father of nine, says he disagrees with same sex marriage and abortion but respects the law. He recently incorporated plans to tackle climate change and protect women's rights in a campaign focused on reducing crime and curbing immigration.</p><p>The message is popular with Chileans rattled by the protests and by the pandemic, which killed nearly 40,000 in this country of 19 million. Sunday's vote takes place while a leftist assembly is drafting a new constitution to replace the dictatorship-era charter, a process opposed by Mr. Kast, who has defended Gen. Pinochet's rule.</p><p>Mr. Boric, whose coalition includes the Communist Party, met with a prominent business chamber to reassure that his economic changes would be modest. But he has called for raising taxes and ramping up spending, dismantling a private pension system, and creating a state-owned lithium company.</p><p>Economists say the frustration among young voters is in part because they haven't enjoyed the same material benefits as older Chileans despite a surge in university enrollments that saddled them with big student debt.</p><p>Sergio Urzúa, a Chilean economist at the University of Maryland, found that people aged 18 to 25 years old saw their real income decline from 2011 to 2020 while it was flat for those aged 26 to 35 years old. From 1990 to 2010, both age groups saw robust income growth.</p><p>\"There is a mismatch between the aspirations and expectations of this group and what the labor market has been offering,\" Mr. Urzúa says. \"We need to understand Boric as a result of this process.\"</p><p>But Mr. Boric's proposals could worsen the economic situation, Mr. Urzúa says.</p><p>\"He's not really offering a plan for the future for that generation,\" he says. \"I don't think what they want is an economy that is driven by the state.\"</p><p>Ms. Galaz, the 25-year-old Boric supporter, wants to move out of her mom's house in a poor Santiago barrio, but she says she can't afford to do so with a job managing a school computer lab that pays $470 a month.</p><p>\"We haven't personally felt the economic growth,\" says Ms. Galaz, who studies psychology at university at night.</p><p>Cristina Lasnibat, 58, agrees that more needs to be done to tackle inequality in Chile. But she remembers the long lines to buy chicken and laundry detergent amid shortages during Chile's last far-left government, that of President Salvador Allende, and is voting for the conservative Mr. Kast.</p><p>Write to Ryan Dube at ryan.dube@dowjones.com</p><p>Chile's Presidential Election Pits Young Versus Old in Key Vote for Economy</p>",
