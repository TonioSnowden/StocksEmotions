  "title": "Limited Partners Devote New Capital to Venture Funds Led by Women, Minorities; Accolade Partners has raised a $200 million fund to invest in funds started by underrepresented groups",
  "text": "<p>\"I don't think you could've done this five years ago, but today there's a critical mass of funds to choose from,\" said Joelle Kayden, managing partner and principal owner of Washington, D.C.-based fund-of-funds manager Accolade, which she founded more than two decades ago to invest in venture and growth-equity funds.</p><p>Ms. Kayden said that Accolade has a database of about 150 firms that would fit its criteria and plans to make about 15 investments over the next two years or so. The firm has already made commitments to venture-capital funds including Acrew Capital, Base10 Partners, Footwork, Leadout Capital and Moxxie Ventures, as well as growth-equity funds such as Biospring Partners and Clearhaven Partners.</p><p>Accolade's new fund will be focused on generating returns that outperform the market, Ms. Kayden said, and will aim to demonstrate that diversity enhances outcomes in private markets.</p><p>As more startup founders seek to accept capital from demographically diverse investor groups, diverse fund managers are now poised to win more deals, Ms. Kayden said. New initiatives to diversify boards of public companies from Nasdaq Inc. , as well as a new California law  requiring that, also are driving interest in bringing underrepresented board members into startups earlier.</p><p>Erica Duignan Minnihan and Monique Idlett Mosley, both Black women, have been investing in startups together for about nine years and began raising their first fund as founding partners at Reign Ventures in 2018, Ms. Duignan Minnihan said.</p><p>\"For the first year, it was actually really challenging, the market was not very responsive to our thesis around the value we created from investing in underrepresented founders,\" she said.</p><p>But that changed over the past year, she said, as corporations and institutions made new commitments to address inequities in capital flows, while regulations were relaxed  around banks investing in venture funds. The combination \"really lit the match to our ability to successfully raise capital,\" Ms. Duignan Minnihan said.</p><p>At the same time, some efforts in the venture industry toward diversifying its investor ranks have been stymied by other trends, such as large established venture firms  absorbing more capital.</p><p>The number of first-time venture funds raised in the U.S. declined to 76 in 2020 , raising $5.2 billion, from 134 that raised $7.4 billion in 2019 and a record 159 debut funds attracting $12.3 billion in 2018, according to PitchBook Data Inc .</p><p>Despite diversity efforts in the venture industry, participation by women and minority investors remains low and has even been declining on a proportional basis. Women-led venture funds, for example, raised just 3.3% of all capital going to venture funds last year, down from about 10% between 2017 and 2019, according to a report by venture advisory firm Different Funds.</p><p>Black and Latinx-led venture funds, meanwhile, accounted for 4.5% of all capital raised in 2020, compared with 5.2% in 2019, according to Different Funds.</p><p>Getting more limited partners to actively support diversity is crucial, said Eva Ho, general partner at seed venture firm Fika Ventures and founding member at All Raise, a nonprofit focused on boosting the number of female venture investors.</p><p>\"Fundamentally, LPs manage most of the capital from up top, and if they don't distribute that to diverse managers then we won't have enough diverse managers and then we won't have capital going to diverse founders. It's a pretty direct correlation,\" Ms. Ho said.</p><p>Several other LP groups have been formed over the past year to invest in underrepresented fund managers, including First Close Partners  and the Equity Alliance LLC.</p><p>Several corporations have taken similar steps. Goldman Sachs Group Inc ., for example, boosted its commitment to invest in diverse-led companies and funds to $1 billion in March from an initial $500 million in 2018. PayPal Holdings Inc ., meanwhile, announced in October it would invest $50 million in eight early-stage, Black- and Latinx-led venture capital funds.</p><p>\"Venture capital has been a terrific way for wealth creation, and that should be better distributed,\" Accolade's Ms. Kayden said.</p><p>Accolade Empowerment Fund LP aims to serve as an anchor investor in first institutional funds, typically sized $25 million or larger, from each firm. Although Acrew and Base10 are more established firms, Ms. Kayden said both have significant diversity efforts when it comes to startup investing that are consistent with Accolade's goals.</p><p>It took Accolade a while to raise its new diversity-focused fund, a process that began in 2019. \"Nobody is going to come out and say it's a bad idea,\" Ms. Kayden said, \"but on the other hand, I didn't see the commitment dollars rush in our direction.\"</p><p>Write to Yuliya Chernova at yuliya.chernova@wsj.com</p>",
