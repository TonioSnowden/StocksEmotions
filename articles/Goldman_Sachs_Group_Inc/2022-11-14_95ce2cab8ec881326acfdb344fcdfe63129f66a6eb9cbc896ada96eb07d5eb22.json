  "title": "World News:  China Eases  Property  Restrictions  ----  By Lingling Wei, Cao Li and Stella Yifan Xie",
  "text": "<p>   For much of the past year, China's economy has been reeling under Xi Jinping's dual campaigns to rein in soaring property prices and to stamp out any traces of Covid-19 within the country's borders. </p><p>   Now, as he moves to loosen pandemic restrictions, China's leader, Mr. Xi, is signaling a reversal of his real-estate crackdown, too, a tacit acknowledgment of the economic pain and public frustration that the two policies have engendered. </p><p>   China's central bank and top banking regulator issued a wide-ranging series of measures aimed at bolstering housing demand and supply, according to a notice circulated on Friday to the country's financial institutions and officials involved in policy-making. The authenticity of the document was confirmed by people close to the central bank. </p><p>   The new policies, which were signed off on by Mr. Xi, according to the officials involved in policy-making, unwind some of the previous restrictions aimed at curbing property developer debt and give lenders permission to extend loans to home builders in financial trouble. </p><p>   \"These property measures, on top of announcements of Covid loosening, are a clear indication that Beijing's efforts to support growth are intensifying,\" said Michael Hirson, head of China Research at 22V Research, a New York-based firm focused on investment strategy. </p><p>   While local governments across China have taken more modest measures to ease some of the pressure facing real-estate companies, the new bundle of 16 measures represents the single biggest step yet to rescue a sector that has for decades been a key pillar of growth for the world's second-largest economy. </p><p>   Shares of Chinese property developers surged Monday following the news. Country Garden Holdings Co. jumped 40% in early trading in Hong Kong. A Hang Seng subindex of property stocks rose 7%. </p><p>   The new measures are \"massive in scale\" and amount to \"targeted credit easing for the property industry,\" said Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China, who drew a contrast with previous rounds of incremental support measures. </p><p>   As developers face looming loan repayment deadlines, regulators are eager to avoid any systemic risks in the financial sector triggered by a wave of potential defaults, Ms. Wang said. Even so, she added, \"demand for home purchase remains weak,\" with any reversal in housing-market sentiment likely to depend on the longer-term outlook for the economy. </p><p>   The easing of real-estate and Covid restrictions comes just weeks after Mr. Xi secured another five years in power at a closely watched Communist Party congress. Mr. Xi now faces the prospect of a third term in office amid the country's worst prolonged economic slowdown in decades. </p><p>   Much of the economic weakness is a direct product of his campaign-style clampdowns to crush Covid and, starting last year, tame a four-decade-old property market boom that officials have warned may be a bubble. </p><p>   The property measures led to increased defaults by developers, rising bad debts for banks, falling home sales and investment -- all of which have weighed heavily on overall growth. China's gross domestic product expanded just 3% in the first nine months of 2022, well below the government's full-year target of about 5.5%. </p><p>   Chinese home prices have for decades outpaced the rate of broader economic growth, driving more credit into real-estate speculation and further pushing up property values. Authorities in recent years have repeatedly tried to break the vicious cycle with various tightening measures, only to loosen them whenever growth appears threatened. </p><p>   By 2019, the total value of Chinese homes and developers' inventory was $52 trillion, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., twice the size of the U.S. residential market. </p><p>   As Beijing tightened the screws on developers last year -- and then reaffirmed its commitment to the tougher rules -- several private developers began to teeter on the brink of crisis. Among the most prominent was China Evergrande Group, long the country's largest developer. </p><p>   More than 30 developers have defaulted on their dollar-denominated bonds. International investors have dumped their bonds, driving price levels to new lows. </p><p></p>",
