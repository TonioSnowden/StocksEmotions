  "text": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/COP26/status/1431244819561697284?s=20\">The Queen </a>is definitely coming. US President Joe Biden says he will be there “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/09/21/remarks-by-president-biden-and-prime-minister-johnson-of-the-united-kingdom-before-bilateral-meeting/\">with bells on</a>”. A Goldman Sachs team is expected, along with Larry Fink, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7dfd1e3d-e256-4656-a96d-1204538d75cd\">the boss of BlackRock</a>, a clutch of other financiers, reams of chief executives and dozens of world leaders. After 18 cooped-up Covid months, a solid chunk of the Davos set is gathering for some serious in-person action at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow next month.</p> <p>Alas, a lot of these newcomers are discovering what so many have found before them: few meetings are as misunderstood as a COP, and this one is shaping up to be even more bewildering than most. </p> <p>The word COP itself offers an early warning sign of what lurks ahead. It stands for the “<a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop?page=%2C%2C%2C0%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C%2C0%2C0\">conference of the parties</a>” to the UN framework convention on climate change agreed in 1992, the main international treaty on fighting global warming.</p> <p>In essence, COPs are where the world's governments review how well they are doing at saving humanity and, in a good year, come up with a new agreement to do more. In a better world, there would be a simpler name for COPs, which have been running more or less annually since 1995. Something such as “UN climate meeting” would do. But in the world of UN climatry, things are rarely simple.</p> <p>For one thing, it is best to think of a COP as two COPs. In the official one, hundreds of government delegates spend two weeks locked in complex negotiations to finalise the legal text of an agreement they have worked on for months. The other is a vast climate expo, a whirl of exhibitions, panel discussions, parties and dinners that can draw an Amazonian indigenous leader as easily as a Silicon Valley billionaire.</p> <p>Much of this activity takes place next to the main venue, which in Glasgow will be a sprawling event centre on the banks of the River Clyde. But as at Davos, the Swiss mountain resort that hosts the World Economic Forum's annual January jamboree, access to events depends on getting the right badge.</p> <p>Unlike Davos, Wall Street bankers do not generally reach centre stage. Most are confined to the expo periphery, where some are making other unnerving discoveries about COP realities. While Davos is comfortably remote, COP26 will take place a brisk walk from the M8, one of the UK's busiest motorways. All the better to deliver the crowds of climate activists planning to descend on Glasgow, to the alarm of some COP corporate event organisers. </p> <p>Yet climate protests are a fixture of these gatherings and will doubtless be large in Glasgow, which is hosting what's known as a “big COP”. This does not mean it is doing anything as important as hammering out a new treaty, such as the Paris accord agreed in 2015. But it does mark a crucial five-year deadline for countries to deliver improved emissions-cutting plans beyond those offered in Paris and typically, far <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfddd700-062a-4e03-98c7-1f329acdbe67\">too many </a>are dragging their feet.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/141ad2e5-35e9-4cf9-8cbc-34c304aa08d5.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>It is tempting to dismiss COPs as pointless talking shops, and it is true that the governments leading them are failing to act nearly fast enough. Yet it was the 2015 Paris COP that requested the landmark 2018 UN <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/\">science report</a>, which permanently reshaped the global climate debate by showing the size and pace of emission cuts needed to keep temperatures at safer levels.</p> <p>The same meeting delivered the idea of bringing emissions down to net zero by 2050. The concept was considered wildly radical and impractical then, yet today net zero targets cover at least <a href=\"https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-03-23-net-zero-pledges-go-global-now-action-needs-follow-words-oxford-eciu-report\">two-thirds </a>of the global economy and have been adopted by dozens of big corporate emitters.</p> <p>“<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/09/28/world/greta-thunberg-climate-intl/index.html\">Blah, blah, blah</a>,” climate activist Greta Thunberg may well say. Davos regulars might agree with her. But the truth is that, imperfect as COPs are, the world would be immeasurably worse off without them.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:pilita.clark@ft.com\"><em>pilita.clark@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Pilita Clark 2021 'The Davos set descending on COP26 should prepare themselves' FT.com 8 October.
