  "text": "<p>GameStop shares dropped 60 per cent on Tuesday as losses piled up on stocks favoured by the army of day traders that have organised on the social media site Reddit.</p> <p>The declines were so sharp that they triggered multiple trading halts in GameStop. Automatic curbs also kicked in to calm jittery trading in other stocks favoured by retail traders. </p> <p>GameStop and others such as BlackBerry and AMC Entertainment have become synonymous with the new wave of day traders that have swept into US financial markets since the pandemic hit the country last year.</p> <p>Last week's rally in GameStop shares inflicted billions of dollars of losses for hedge funds which had bet that the company's shares would decline, prompting a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa74a7c6-bcb0-469e-8b76-c5dfc04b9564\">bailout of star manager</a> Gabe Plotkin's Melvin Capital from Citadel and Point72 Asset Management. </p> <p>But a Goldman Sachs index of US stocks targeted by short sellers dropped more than 7 per cent on Tuesday, suggesting that hedge funds that have stuck with their negative bets were making money again and that the tide has turned in the battle with retail investors. The index is down 14 per cent since last Wednesday.</p> <p>GameStop has now lost more than 80 per cent of its value from an intraday peak last week. Shares of AMC fell 41 per cent on Tuesday, while BlackBerry declined 21 per cent.</p> <p>The spiralling losses prompted disagreements over how to react, and anger in some quarters. Some traders on the Reddit message board r/WallStreetBets repeated the mantra to “hold the line”, telling other investors who had piled into AMC and GameStop not to sell.</p> <p>Tech entrepreneur Mark Cuban encouraged traders to stick with their positions. “If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold,” he wrote on Reddit. “I don't own it, but that's what I would do.”</p> <p>Dave Portnoy, a sports betting blogger who became unofficial leader of the day-trading army last year, said he had sold his “meme stocks”, however. He blamed the resulting loss of roughly $700,000 on Robinhood, saying the online brokerage's chief executive Vlad Tenev “stole it from me and should be in jail”.</p> <p>Robinhood curbed trading in GameStop and other hot stocks last Thursday, in common with some other online brokerages, after being required to post more cash with its clearing house to protect against losses during the volatility.</p> <p>Regulators and politicians are examining the trading restrictions. The financial services committee of the House of Representatives has scheduled a hearing on the rally and crash in GameStop shares for later this month.</p> <p>Robinhood on Tuesday said it was easing some of the remaining restrictions, including raising the amount of GameStop shares its users could buy to 100, from just one on Monday. </p> <p>Silver, which had become another target of at least some retail investors, also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77e6fef6-37ff-4f8e-abd6-4c2d65ac120c\">pulled back sharply</a> on Tuesday after a rally in the previous session. The precious metal dropped 10 per cent to settle at $26.40 an ounce, having risen to an eight-year peak&#xa0;above $30 on Monday, according to CME Group.</p> <p>“This was bound to happen — it goes back to the age-old premise that the stock market ultimately at the fringes is driven by greed and fear,” said Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners. “I feel badly for anybody who's jumped on this trade in the last week, especially on the buy side.”</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/9b223e93-b22f-4bee-b95c-0d0cc13b27b0.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Eric Platt, Colby Smith and Aziza Kasumov in New York and Madison Darbyshire in London 2021 'GameStop shares slide 60% as Reddit rally deflates' FT.com 2 February.
