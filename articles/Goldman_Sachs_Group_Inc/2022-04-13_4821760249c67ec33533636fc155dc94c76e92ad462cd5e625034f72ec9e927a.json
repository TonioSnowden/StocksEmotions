  "text": "<p>Stellantis shareholders have rejected a proposed €19mn pay package for the carmaker's chief executive Carlos Tavares and remuneration for other managers after an outcry from a minority investor and some French unions over excessive payouts. </p> <p>Just over 52 per cent of investors voted against <a href=\"https://www.stellantis.com/content/dam/stellantis-corporate/investors/stock-and-shareholder-info/shareholder-meetings/agm-2022/Agenda_and_Notes_AGM_2022.pdf\">the remuneration report </a>of the world's fourth biggest carmaker at an investor meeting on Wednesday. </p> <p>The company, formed through a €50bn merger between Peugeot owner PSA of France and Fiat Chrysler last year, said the vote, which is not binding, would “be taken into account”. </p> <p>It added it would detail any changes in its 2022 pay report, though it gave no further indication of how this would be reflected.</p> <p>The shareholder vote comes only days before the last round of the French presidential vote.</p> <p>The country is in the middle of a tight election race between incumbent President Emmanuel Macron and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aea77380-08c0-4f57-80ff-0121d0646ee8\">Marine Le Pen of the far-right</a>, in a campaign dominated by concerns over the high cost of living as energy costs soar. </p> <p>The carmaker posted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35b2a072-3550-49ea-a7d1-9c65d6394413\">record profits of €13.4bn in 2021</a> on a pro forma basis and boosted operating margins despite struggling like rivals with a shortage of semiconductors that hit production as it came out of pandemic lockdowns. </p> <p>Tavares, one of the architects of last year's merger, had come under particular scrutiny over his remuneration. </p> <p>The former PSA executive was due a €19.1mn pay package, including share awards, an incentive for completing the merger and a €2mn fixed salary component. The salary was a 17.6 per cent rise on 2020 levels when he was still at the French group. </p> <p>That would put him at the high end of the scale for European car executives — Herbert Diess, the chief executive of Germany's Volkswagen, which like Stellantis has been racing to push more electric vehicles, was due a total of €8.6mn for 2021.</p> <p>In the US, pay packages have tended to be larger, however, with Jim Farley, the boss of Ford Motor, on course for a payout of close to $23mn.&#xa0;</p> <p>A report from Stellantis minority investor Phitrust added fuel to the fire earlier this week after the group claimed Tavares was in fact due to collect closer to €66mn in 2021, based on its estimation of longer-term incentives for which he might be eligible, an amount it called “indecent”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Stellantis said this figure was “completely false” as it was based on objectives to 2028 that he had yet to meet, and on calculations based on today's share price. </p> <p>Unions attacked Tavares' pay package too, with Christine Virassamy of France's CFDT calling on politicians to “take measures” to cap executive pay.</p> <p>“These situations contribute and unfortunately drive people to take extreme positions in elections,” Virassamy said in a statement. </p> <p>Pressed on the topic of Tavares' pay on Wednesday, French government spokesperson Gabriel Attal said it was up to shareholders to have their say, but also told a weekly news conference that “these are not normal numbers”.</p> <p>Shareholders have increased their scrutiny of executive pay packages ahead of investor meetings, with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fcf7ff2-3ab3-42d9-912a-5af4d09faf6a\">Axa shareholders</a> for example urged by one proxy group to vote against its chief executive's pay, while another in the US has recommended investors vote against <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f948857e-4e0f-4275-a53c-011238e1f9c3\">Goldman Sachs bonuses </a>for two top executives. </p> <p>The company's shares were unmoved, closing flat at €13.97.</p><p>Source: Sarah White in Paris 2022 'Shareholders in carmaker Stellantis reject Tavares pay plan ' FT.com 13 April.
