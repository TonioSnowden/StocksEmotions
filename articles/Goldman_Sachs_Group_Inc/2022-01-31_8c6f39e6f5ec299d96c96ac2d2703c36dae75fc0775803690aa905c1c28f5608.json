  "title": "GM earnings: Investors will be inspecting 2022 outlook and EV plans",
  "text": "<p>The stock has struggled so far this year, however, as Wall Street remains concerned about the impact of supply shortages on auto makers.</p><p>For both GM and Ford Motor Co. F, the “focus will be on each company's 2022 guidance in the face of ongoing chip shortages and supply-chain issues,” CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said.</p><p>Here's what to expect:</p><p>Earnings: The FactSet consensus calls for GM to report adjusted per-share earnings of $1.16 for the quarter. That would compare with adjusted earnings of $1.93 a share in the fourth quarter of 2020.</p><p>Estimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts as well as buy-side analysts, fund managers, company executives, academics and others, is expecting an adjusted profit of $1.29 a share for GM.</p><p>Revenue: The analysts polled by FactSet are calling for sales of $35.8 billion for the auto maker, which would compare with $37.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Estimize is expecting $35.5 billion in revenue for the quarter.</p><p>Stock price: GM shares have underperformed the broader index, gaining 3% in the past 12 months compared with gains of around 21% for the S&amp;P 500 index. SPX The stock has lost around 4% in the past three months compared with losses of around 3% for the S&amp;P.</p><p>What else to expect: Wall Street is likely to want more details about that highly anticipated electric Silverado, like its timing and production ramp, CFRA's Nelson said.</p><p>Overall, auto makers have faced “another challenging quarter,” analysts at B. of A. Securities said in a recent note. Production is seen improving, which bodes well for OEMs like GM, they said. Expectations for the broader industry “have been set reasonably low,” they said.</p><p>GM gets an advantage as its core business “is being well managed even amidst a choppy macro, while the accelerating focus on future-proofing the business with the development of the necessary components of the future of mobility services, including an autonomous electric vehicle fleet (Cruise Automation + Bolts), car sharing (Maven), and connectivity (OnStar), may provide upside” for the stock, they said.</p><p>Goldman Sachs analysts have GM as a top pick alongside Tesla Inc. TSLA</p><p>Auto makers' industry fundamentals will be “generally positive in 2022,” with increasing deliveries and a still-tight supply and demand picture supporting “strongpricing,” they said.</p><p>GM and Tesla are the preferred names “given what we consider to be their strong technology portfolios in EVs and ADAS/AVs,” the Goldman analysts said.</p><p>GM has set a goal of being carbon neutral by 2040 and has pledged to invest $35 billion in electric and autonomous vehicles, with plans to have more than 30 EV models globally by 2025.</p><p>GM last week confirmed plans to spend nearly $7 billion to in battery and EV factories in Michigan. </p><p>Tesla reported its fourth-quarter results last week, while Ford was scheduled to report its earnings on Thursday after the bell.</p>",
