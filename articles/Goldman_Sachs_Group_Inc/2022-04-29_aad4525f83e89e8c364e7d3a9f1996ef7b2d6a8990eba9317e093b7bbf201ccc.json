  "text": "<p>Their outlook could be put to the test quickly. On Friday, the government will release its personal-consumption expenditures price index data for March. In February, the headline index rose by 6.4% from a year earlier, with the core measure up by 5.4%.</p><p>Ahead of the first-quarter GDP report, economists expected a 5.3% increase for the core PCE price index in March from a year earlier. But now first-quarter GDP data \"imply that the March core PCE deflator printed only 0.11%, which would be the weakest monthly reading since November 2020 and well below the widely expected 0.3% core print expected tomorrow,\" economist Omair Sharif of Inflation Insights wrote in a note to clients. \"It would also imply a large fall in the [year-over-year] rate, from 5.4% in February to 5.1% in March.\"</p><p>It is also possible older PCE price index data could be revised lower to show less inflation, Mr. Sharif added.</p><p>Economists at Goldman Sachs said they lowered their outlook for March's core PCE price index in the wake of the GDP data and now see it rising 5.2% from a year earlier. Morgan Stanley also sees the chance of a weaker number for March, but suspects the biggest change could be a downward revision to the core PCE price index gain of 5.2% seen in January, given how first-quarter GDP data is compiled.</p><p>Federal Reserve officials would welcome weaker inflation data ahead of their Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting next Tuesday and Wednesday. At the meeting, they are almost certain to speed up their interest rate rise campaign by following their quarter percentage point increase in March with a half percentage point increase. Rate increases of a similar size could follow at the next few FOMC gatherings.</p><p>A number of Fed officials have said lowering inflation is their prime mission in an economy that is otherwise doing well with very low levels of unemployment. Some have also said they expect inflation pressures to slowly ease as the Fed shifts its policy and as supply chain problems stemming from the pandemic slowly get resolved. But Russia's attack on Ukraine, which has roiled global energy markets, has clouded the outlook for prices and reduced hopes that inflation will ease in the near term.</p><p>Fed officials have expressed confidence they will be able to get inflation under control because even as the public's near-term inflation expectations have surged, longer-term expectations have been more stable. That suggests the public is confident high inflation won't endure.</p><p>That said, polling organization Gallup said in a report Thursday that respondents to its annual economy and personal finance survey, conducted earlier this month, listed inflation as their most important financial problem. Nearly one-third of survey participants offered that response, compared with 8% a year earlier.</p><p>Write to Michael S.
