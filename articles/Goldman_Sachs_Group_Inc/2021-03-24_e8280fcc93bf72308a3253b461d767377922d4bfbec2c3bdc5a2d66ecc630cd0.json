  "text": "<p>Your article (“Junior Goldman Sachs bankers complain of 95-hour week”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d853d6b4-1546-4435-9b7e-99e3e9475d50\">Report</a>, FT.com, March 18) underscores a widespread and long-running problem in investment banking.</p> <p>Following societal concerns over a junior banker's death at a rival bank, in 2015 Goldman Sachs introduced limited changes such as work-free Saturdays. However, your report suggests that the wellbeing problem is far from solved.</p> <p>My interviews with banks suggest that the problem is a dysfunctional work ethic, where juniors are needlessly sacrificed, feel unfairly treated and often go on to mistreat others — not only subordinates, but customers.</p> <p>It is all too easy not to empathise with the junior bankers on the grounds that “they signed up for it”; but that same argument has been used to justify sexual harassment and workplace abuse.</p> <p>Society and regulators should not turn a blind eye to these juniors. As the success of the #MeToo campaign shows, protracted injustice can be collectively denounced. Indeed, finance is not the only industry where painful overwork is the rule (hospitals in the US are another example) and existing studies show that solutions are possible. More humane work hours on Wall Street and in the City will not only bring about a fairer bank culture, but also a more honest financial sector.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Beunza</strong><br><em>Associate Professor of Management<br>The Business School ( formerly Cass) <br>City University of London, London EC1, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Gruelling work hours reveal banks' dysfunction' FT.com 24 March.
