  "text": "<p>Stocks meandered lower in the final hour of trading, deepening this week's losses for all three indexes. Some traders said low composite trading volume, which was about 15% below this year's daily average according to Dow Jones Market Data, helped accelerate the afternoon's declines. U.S. stock markets are closed on Friday.</p><p>Investors this week got their first peek at how companies fared in the first quarter as earnings season kicked off in earnest. Over the past year, corporate earnings have largely been on a tear thanks to government stimulus payments and strong consumer spending. The fear among traders and investors is that rising inflation will end that trend.</p><p>\"We're starting to see some cracks in the foundation of the super strong consumer, and it's starting to have some impact on company bottom lines,\" said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. \"Retail sales are still good, but we saw JPMorgan is going to raise their provisions for credit losses because there could be some defaults. At Wells Fargo, we're seeing some impact of higher mortgage rates. Sentiment is not as good.\"</p><p>Big U.S. banks were expected to suffer from comparisons to bumper profits during the pandemic. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings for S&amp;P 500 banks fell 37% from a year ago, according to FactSet.</p><p>Wells Fargo shares fell 4.5% after the bank reported a drop in first-quarter earnings. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup all reported results that were better than analysts' forecasts. JP Morgan reported Wednesday.</p><p>Twitter shares, which at one point were up more than 5% and subsequently fell into negative territory, ended the day down 77 cents, or 1.7%, at $45.08. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, who holds a more than 9% stake in the social-media company, disclosed an offer to buy the company outright in a deal valuing it at more than $43 billion. Tesla fell $37.37, or 3.7%, to $985. The S&amp;P 500's communications-services sector, of which Twitter is a component, fell 0.4%. Its tech sector was off 2.5%.</p><p>Peloton Interactive shares fell $1.16, or 4.6%, to $23.87, after the company said it would cut prices of its stationary bikes and treadmills and raise monthly subscriptions for online workout classes. On Wednesday, activist investor Blackwells Capital reiterated its push for Peloton to consider a sale.</p><p>Corporate results will be scrutinized for guidance on how companies expect to manage tighter policy from the Federal Reserve. \"Investors are trying to figure out if the Fed is on the right course. Can they stick to landing in terms of bringing inflation down without bringing the economy down?\" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.808% from 2.688% on Wednesday. While wavering in recent days, the yield on the benchmark note this week hit its highest level since January 2019 as investors gear up for rising interest rates. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>In economic news, U.S. consumer sentiment rose in April, according to the University of Michigan, beating the consensus forecast of economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. March consumer retail and restaurant spending rose by 0.5% from the previous month, the Commerce Department said.</p><p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, settled up 2.7% to $111.70 a barrel, rising nearly 9% for the week.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7% as gains for travel stocks balanced losses for telecommunication companies. The European Central Bank said that recent economic data made it more likely that the bank would end its net bond purchases in the third quarter.</p><p>Early Friday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 0.9% and the Shanghai Composite was flat. Hong Kong was closed for a holiday. S&amp;P 500 futures were down 1.2%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
