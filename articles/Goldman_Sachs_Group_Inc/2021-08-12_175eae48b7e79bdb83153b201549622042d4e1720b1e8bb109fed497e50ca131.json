  "text": "<h2>AppHarvest: growing pains</h2> <p>Few businesses can bring together the US domestic goddess <strong>Martha Stewart</strong>, hedge fund veteran <strong>Jeff Ubben</strong> and <em>Hillbilly Elegy</em> author <strong>JD Vance</strong>. Who would've thought it would be tomatoes?&#xa0;</p> <p>They're all early backers of<strong> AppHarvest</strong>, a start-up that runs America's largest hydroponic greenhouse, otherwise known as vertical farming.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Kentucky-based company took a bit of a bruising on Wednesday, to say the least.</p> <p>Shares in AppHarvest, which became a listed company earlier this year through a deal with a special purpose acquisition company, fell by as much as 40 per cent following news that it wouldn't meet the projections it made a few months ago.&#xa0;</p> <p>Even before the company had harvested its first tomato, AppHarvest announced plans to go public through a deal with <strong>Novus Capital Corporation</strong> at a $1bn valuation. This was in September, the heady days of the Spac boom when companies were clinching deals to go public at a rapid pace and lofty valuations. The FT's Lex column <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e44b4b5f-16a5-424f-a786-c4d4d40ee4db\">pointed out</a> at the time that it was perhaps too early for a listing.&#xa0;</p> <p>While AppHarvest was yet to open its doors to its first greenhouse, it projected $21m in revenue for this year, which would shoot up to $387m in 2025, in a <a href=\"https://novuscapitalcorporation.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Project-Agro-Investor-Presentation-vPublic_2_AppHarvest-1.pdf\">glossy presentation</a> to investors. Shares rose as high as $40 after it listed in February, earning the company a $3.5bn valuation.</p> <p>But as FT Alphaville's Jamie Powell <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52b775ce-54bc-4111-85b9-e3c3f29c3ebf\">points out</a>, those numbers have now been revised down <a href=\"https://agfundernews.com/appharvest-completes-reverse-merger-to-go-public-at-1bn-valuation.html\">significantly</a>: “The company adjusted its full-year 2021 net sales outlook to the range of $7m to $9m from a prior range of $20m to $25m.” Its losses are also higher than expected — from $48m to $70m.&#xa0;</p> <p>One of the main perks of going public through a Spac, instead of a traditional initial public offering, is the ability to make projections about the company's growth.&#xa0;</p> <p>Businesses that choose an IPO aren't prohibited from doing the same but there are serious liability risks with doing so, hence a “quiet period” ahead of the listing.&#xa0;</p> <p>While the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> was largely silent on the issue for much of the boom period, it has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e892b37f-fe31-46ff-ad25-2b6344db0d54\">recently warned companies</a> that it will closely scrutinise projections.&#xa0;</p> <p>AppHarvest is standing by its 2025 outlook, which strikes DD as odd given how much it has missed the mark so far in 2021. According to the presentation, it will have 12 facilities in the next four years capable of producing tomatoes, cucumbers and leafy greens.&#xa0;</p> <p>Let's hope it can produce the kind of green investors like, as well.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Power, private equity and European football</h2> <p>The last time DD checked in on <strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong>' attempt to buy a stake in Spain's top football competition <strong>La Liga</strong>, things weren't looking easy for the private equity firm.&#xa0;</p> <p>CVC had knowingly placed itself at the centre of a long-running power struggle between the league and two of its top clubs, <strong>Real Madrid</strong> and <strong>Barcelona</strong>, not long after they tried to break away into a <strong>European Super League</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the two clubs were unhappy about what they saw as a backroom deal between the league and a group of financiers. Since then, Real Madrid has threatened legal action to block any deal.</p> <p>The row is due to come to a head on Thursday, as La Liga's 42 clubs vote on the proposal. CVC needs 32 votes and knows that this part is tricky: a lack of support from clubs is what caused private equity deals with Italy's <strong>Serie A</strong> and Germany's <strong>Bundesliga</strong> to fall through this year.&#xa0;</p> <p>But La Liga is sounding confident. “We are going to have a big majority,” <strong>José Guerra Álvarez</strong>, corporate managing director at La Liga, told the FT's Sam Agini in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a35ce402-eb6f-4f69-b8a3-88031b26b477\">this story</a> alongside DD's Kaye Wiggins.&#xa0;</p> <p>Even CVC, which hardly ever makes public comments on its deals, especially when they're at a sensitive point, is being punchy: it said this week that Real Madrid's planned legal action was “totally disproportionate and unfounded”.</p> <p>La Liga has brought in <strong>Rothschild &amp; Co</strong>, which has produced a report that favours its case, saying the offer is “fair from a financial point of view”. Barcelona had previously said CVC was underpaying.</p> <p>The Rothschild report contains some new insights on how the deal will work.&#xa0;</p> <p>CVC (which is using a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-soccer-privateequity-goldman-sa/goldman-to-lend-1-billion-euros-to-cvc-for-laliga-deal-sources-say-idUSKBN2FC1I2\">€1bn loan</a> from <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, per Reuters) would pay about €100m for a minority stake in a company holding La Liga's broadcasting and sponsorship rights.&#xa0;</p> <p>It would also contribute €2.5bn to La Liga, to be shared between its clubs.&#xa0;</p> <p>In return CVC would be entitled to an 11 per cent share of revenues for the next 50 years. The clubs would get the €2.5bn in the form of “shareholder loan notes”, essentially interest-free loans that would mature in 40 to 50 years.&#xa0;</p> <p>Will the clubs think it's a fair price? It's “not straightforward” to find a comparable group of companies from which to assess CVC's valuation of La Liga at 15.1 times 2021 earnings, the Rothschild bankers note.&#xa0;</p> <p>A group of premium content companies including <strong>Netflix</strong> and <strong>Disney</strong> was valued at almost 22 times earnings, they said. And a group of sports companies including <strong>Formula One</strong> and the <strong>Madison Square Garden Company</strong> was valued at 33.4 times.&#xa0;</p> <p>But because Europe's other football leagues have rejected CVC's approaches, it's hard to know for sure.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>EY </strong>has promoted <strong>Bill Stoffel</strong>, its private equity leader for the Americas, to global private equity head. He succeeds <strong>Andres Saenz</strong>, who was recently appointed a global vice chair.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>The <strong>Canada Pension Plan Investment Board</strong> has named <strong>Max Biagosch</strong> as head of direct private equity. He was previously head of a group that oversees CPPIB's portfolio companies and has worked at <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>, <strong>BNP Paribas</strong> and <strong>Permira</strong>.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Aakash Mohan</strong> has joined <strong>RBC Capital Markets</strong> as head of its consumer products banking team. He joins from <strong>Mizuho</strong>, where he led the European consumer and retail unit.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Teneo</strong> managing director <strong>Niccie King </strong>has joined the Australian buy-now-pay-later group <strong>Zip</strong> as its director of global communications.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Latham &amp; Watkins</strong> has hired <strong>Javad Mostofizadeh</strong> as a partner in its investment funds and private equity practices, based in California. He joins from <strong>Gunderson Dettmer</strong>.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>#Enough </strong>Facebook and Twitter have failed to contain the torrent of online racism unleashed by users of its platforms on black English Premier League superstars including Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford, even as their employees and club officials stage a reckoning.
