  "text": "<p>Never mind shortages of lorry drivers or fruit pickers, now things are really getting serious: there's a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93a72db1-92b6-4dae-8fc1-f1118f45d543\">shortage of professional services workers</a>. Some City firms have started to turn away work because of a lack of staff, our correspondents report. Meanwhile, firms' attempts to poach rivals' workers are fuelling a wage spiral among some white-collar workers. Do read Lex and their take on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa86e22b-06cd-4890-9423-643f316764e3\">bunfight for Magic Circle lawyers</a>.</p> <p>Chancellor Rishi Sunak is doing his bit to get to grips with the labour shortages. He is setting aside £500m to help people find jobs — though his package of support will (sensibly) be targeted as those leaving the furlough scheme and older workers. Our correspondents <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/211eeb92-b8ee-41fb-8db6-87710ad5d31a\">bring you the full details</a> ahead of his speech to the Conservative party conference.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Online trading site <strong>Plus500</strong> issued a profit upgrade, saying that it expects full year revenue and earnings to be ahead of current analysts' forecasts — but not by how much. </p> <p><strong>Segro</strong> and <strong>Schroders</strong> have completed a warehouse asset swap. Segro has bought a West London warehouse estate for £140m from Schroders, and Schroders has bought a portfolio of big box and urban sites from Segro for £205m. Schroders has paid Segro £65m. </p> <p>Britain will shortly be graced by the presence of the bosses of <strong>Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, BlackRock and Blackstone</strong>, who are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44b6ca25-a827-4336-bf36-7da442cbb38d\">due to attend a green summit</a> that the government hopes will generate billions in investment. They will join the likes of Jes Staley of Barclays and Charlie Nunn, the new CEO of Lloyds Banking Group. One official said the summit was “being held to make deals happen”. But another with knowledge of the event said any pledge on carbon targets — already adopted by many of the groups — would be “more about show than substance”.</p> <p>The <strong>Wm Morrisons </strong>private equity takeover battle was decided on Saturday, with the supermarket going at auction to Clayton, Dubilier and Rice by a margin of a penny a share. The bid of 287p a share, which shareholders will vote on later this month, values the grocer at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d990b0f-2728-4126-adee-d4111aae7a45\">£9.97bn including debt</a>. Now former Tesco boss <strong>Sir Terry Leahy</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/148713c1-1e34-44ab-9224-b0f9926700e6\">lined up to chair</a> the group. </p> <p>And the accounting watchdog, the Financial Reporting Council, has announced an investigation into the audit of <strong>Akazoo</strong>, a Spac deal that <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/09/spac-lawsuits-jump-in-another-sign-of-suspect-dealmaking-for-the-once-red-hot-space.html\">went bad</a>. </p> <h1>Job Moves</h1> <p><strong>Compass's</strong> chief financial officer Karen Witts is to stand down at the end of this month by mutual agreement. She will be replaced by Palmer Brown, the group's commercial director and formerly interim CFO between 2018 and 2019. </p> <p>And <strong>Flutter</strong> has appointed <strong>Amy Howe</strong> as chief executive of FanDuel. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>A whistleblower has accused <strong>Facebook</strong> of placing “profit over safety” in an interview with news programme <em>60 Minutes</em>. Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager, leaked documents to the Wall Street Journal and has also complained to US securities regulators that the social media company was misleading investors. She suggested that Facebook had lied to the public, exaggerating the progress it had made tackling hate, violence, and misinformation on its platform, presenting “tens of thousands” of pages of documents as evidence. Facebook says the accusations are “misleading” and “ludicrous”. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/960243ec-6a65-4879-bfe1-9afcb2c0c7b3\">Hannah Murphy has the full details</a>. </p> <p>The chief executive of the biotechnology group behind the first Covid-19 vaccine has said a new formulation is likely to be needed by the middle of next year to protect against the virus as it mutates, Erika Solomon and Nikou Asgari report. “This virus will stay, and the virus will further adapt,” <strong>BioNTech</strong> CEO <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d88457da-6bbc-4f07-82a6-4738aa845492\">Ugur Sahin told the FT</a>. </p> <p>And finally, <strong>China Evergrande </strong>latest: the group's property management unit has halted trade in its shares citing a possible takeover offer. The unit's parent also announced a share trading halt in anticipation of “a major transaction”. Get the latest updates on the country's most indebted developer as this story develops on our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f110dc4-5802-472c-859f-6ac9adcdead3\">breaking news stream</a>.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>Columnist <strong>Pilita Clark</strong> finds employers of millennials and Gen-Z troubled by worker shortages that can't be solved by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/411faba8-3d75-4c71-86d2-5b1b308dfc9a\">throwing money at the problem</a>. Some readers have their doubts: many argue that with home ownership so expensive and job security so elusive, the extra amounts on offer from employers just don't make enough of a difference. </p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'Labour shortages extend to professional services' FT.com 4 October.
