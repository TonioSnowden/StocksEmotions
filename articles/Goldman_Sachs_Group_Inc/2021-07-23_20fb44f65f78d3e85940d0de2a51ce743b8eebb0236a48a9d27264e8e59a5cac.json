  "title": "Media & Technology: Instacart Expands Into Warehousing",
  "text": "<p>In such fulfillment centers, the company will use robots to pull items from warehouses and have Instacart's workers pack and deliver orders. Instacart currently deploys shoppers who grab products from grocery stores and drop them off at people's homes. The company didn't say how many centers it will build, where they will be or how much it will invest.</p><p>Warehouses, which will be automated, are expected to speed up the delivery process, the company said. Albertsons Cos., SpartanNash Co. and other grocers are also building small warehouses for online orders.</p><p>San Francisco-based Instacart has grown during the pandemic, as more consumers shifted their shopping online. It is facing new challenges as businesses reopen: Online grocery sales are slowing and shoppers are returning to in-person shopping. Delivery companies are still struggling to turn a profit, as labor and transportation costs eat into profit margins. Many grocers remain worried that they are sharing customers and earnings with Instacart -- which takes a commission for each order -- and say they have more options as delivery companies pitch favorable deals to stand out.</p><p>\"People want what they need when they want it,\" said Mark Schaaf, Instacart's chief technology officer. The company spent recent years looking at ways to offer warehouse services to grocers, he said.</p><p>Instacart added more than 250 retailers in the U.S. and Canada last year and now delivers from more than 600 businesses. It raised nearly $700 million of new capital over the past year amid a boom in business and has a valuation of $39 billion. The company is planning to go public and has beefed up its leadership team. It hired a chief financial officer from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and a chief executive officer and a chief operating officer from Facebook Inc. Fidji Simo, the new CEO, has said she sees opportunities to provide more technology to retailers and expand internationally.</p><p>Industry executives and analysts say that fulfillment centers can cut costs over time, but require upfront investments and typically reach profitability in a year.</p>",
