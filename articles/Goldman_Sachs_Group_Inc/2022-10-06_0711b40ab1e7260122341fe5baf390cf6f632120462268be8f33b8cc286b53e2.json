  "title": "'Grand Theft Auto' hack showed just how profitable GTA6 could be, analyst says; Nuggets gleaned from Take-Two intrusion suggest next version of most lucrative videogame series ever could add more than $10 a share to publisher's earnings, Goldman analyst writes",
  "text": "<p>With that in mind, Sheridan said unit sales and the estimated budget are two key variables in projecting the profitability of GTA6, and the hack provided some clues about them.</p><p>In-depth: 'Grand Theft Auto 5' has made more money than any other single media title in history</p><p>\"Given that the estimated budget was an input based on a press article from this incident (and is significantly higher than the GTA V budget of ~$250-300mm), we flex that variable up and down as well as unit sales in order to assess various EPS outcomes based on those two components,\" Sheridan said.</p><p>After updating his projections, Sheridan sees earnings from GTA6 coming in at more than $10 a share, which would imply more than $1.7 billion based on Take-Two's current shares outstanding.</p><p>\"Assuming the budget is ~$500mm (nearly 2x GTA V budget) but maintaining 170mm unit sell-through, the implied EPS is $10.44 (~$0.40+ more than our base case),\" Sheridan said. \"Meanwhile, assuming the unit sell-through is 245mm units but at the same ~$2bn budget, the implied EPS is ~$11.75 (nearly ~$1.70 more than the base case of $10.04), demonstrating significant leverage with every unit sold.\"</p><p>With an expected $70 list price and microtransactions from the online game, Sheridan expects about $327 million annual operating profit from unit sales and about $372 million of operating profit from microtransactions, or about $699 million total based on about 170 million units over nine years like GTA5, a 75/25 digital versus physical split in sales, about $125 in annual player transactions, and about a $2 billion estimated budget.</p><p>See also: Severity of GTA hack depends on whether source code was taken, analysts say</p><p>This past fiscal year, Take-Two reported adjusted earnings of $5.06 a share on revenue of $3.5 billion, and in August, the company trimmed its outlook to provide for the integration of Zynga. Sheridan's figures, though, also take into account about $1 billion from Take-Two's recently closed acquisition of Zynga by fiscal 2025.</p><p>Shares of Take-Two were up nearly 3% Thursday, while the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF IGV was up 0.2% and the S&amp;P 500 index SPX was down 0.5%. Take-Two shares are down 32% for the year on par with the IGV ETF, and a 21% drop in the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Of the 27 analysts who cover Take-Two, 21 have buy-grade ratings and six have hold ratings, along with an average price target of $164.75.</p><p>'Grand Theft Auto' hack showed just how profitable GTA6 could be, analyst says</p>",
