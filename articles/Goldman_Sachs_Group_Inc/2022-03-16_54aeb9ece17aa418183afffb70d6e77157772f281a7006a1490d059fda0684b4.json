  "title": "Waterous Energy Seeks Scale With Single-Company Portfolio; The Canadian private-equity firm has merged several oil-and-gas companies into Strathcona Resources",
  "text": "<p>Caltex and Stickney were the latest two of eight main acquisitions that Waterous has made since its formation in 2017, said Adam Waterous, the firm's managing partner and chief executive. From the start, he said, Waterous shunned the traditional private-equity model of backing a number of management teams that seek to buy and develop oil-and-gas fields. Instead the firm focused on acquiring more mature, producing assets, including ones acquired out of bankruptcy or restructuring processes.</p><p>\"Historically, oil-and-gas private equity has used a growth-capital model. We are using a value investing strategy,\" Mr. Waterous said, adding that the firm has been building \"a single, scaled operating business.\"</p><p>Size has become increasingly important in the energy industry as return-mindful oil-and-gas companies, among the most active buyers of private-equity-backed peers, favor assets that generate substantial cash flow, industry lawyers and consultants say.</p><p>\"There's less value placed on drilling inventory and much more focus on cash-flow generation,\" said John Pitts, a Houston-based partner at law firm Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP.</p><p>Strathcona's assets are divided into three areas but tightly concentrated in each of them, Mr. Waterous said. They include oil-sands fields in Alberta's Cold Lake region and natural gas operations that extend into the neighboring province of British Columbia. The company also owns heavy-oil assets straddling the provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta.</p><p>Concentrating assets in a single business across few areas helped Strathcona reduce operating costs and amass a credit facility of 1.5 billion Canadian dollars, equivalent to $1.18 billion, that has lower interest rates, a longer maturity and more flexible terms compared with the traditional reserve-based loans that most private equity-backed producers rely on, Mr. Waterous said. Strathcona can pay for all its operating expenses, including debt interest, and hold production flat with oil prices as low as roughly $40 a barrel, he added.</p><p>Strath Resources and Cona Resources were the first two investments that Waterous made with capital from its first fund, which closed in 2018 with C$1.4 billion. They merged two years later. In addition to the fund, Waterous has since raised a total of roughly C$700 million, mostly from its fund backers, for at least four new add-on acquisitions that it backed on a deal-by-deal basis, Mr. Waterous said. For example, Waterous raised additional money to finance acquisitions of Caltex and an oil-sands project in Alberta acquired from Cenovus Energy Inc.</p><p>\"We have found that the fastest, simplest way to raise capital was just around acquisitions,\" he said.</p><p>Waterous has snapped up deals as other managers sought to reduce their energy holdings, buying assets from managers that include BlackRock Inc., Blackstone Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.; private-equity firm Warburg Pincus; and institutional investors such as Canadian pension manager PSP Investments and Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte. Ltd., Mr. Waterous said.</p><p>The firm plans to exit its investment in Strathcona through an initial public offering or a reverse takeover of a publicly traded energy company, according to Mr. Waterous. He added that he isn't afraid that the world's gradual shift to clean energy could reduce the company's value by then, as he believes demand for oil and gas produced at low cost will last the 48 years Strathcona is expected to take to use up all of its reserves.</p><p>\"I am concerned that I may not live to see the end of those 48 years,\" Mr. Waterous said. \"That's my only concern.\"</p><p>Write to Luis Garcia at luis.garcia@wsj.com</p>",
