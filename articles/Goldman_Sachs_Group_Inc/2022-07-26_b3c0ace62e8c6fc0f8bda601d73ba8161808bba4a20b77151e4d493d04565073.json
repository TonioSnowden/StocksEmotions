  "title": "Doubts over Italy's access to €800bn EU Covid fund after Mario Draghi's exit",
  "text": "<p>Governments and investors across Europe are trying to piece together what the collapse of Mario Draghi's government will mean for the EU's €800bn Covid recovery fund — of which Italy is the largest recipient.</p> <p>The fund is the EU's most ambitious joint economic project since the birth of the euro, bringing member states together to guarantee the issuance of joint debt by the European Commission on an unprecedented scale. Italy alone has been allocated €200bn of EU funds, considered vital to reboot the country's chronically underperforming economy.</p> <p>Like the other countries, Italy has agreed an ambitious timetable of reform milestones and investment targets to unlock tranches of EU money. But a premature election campaign casts doubt on whether the country can hit this year's deadlines — a concern acknowledged by president Sergio Mattarella as he dissolved parliament last week.</p> <p>“There are pivotal deadlines,” Mattarella warned. “I hope that, notwithstanding the usual tones of a campaign, everyone will give their constructive contribution.”</p> <p>Italy has received €46bn, made up of a €25bn advance and a first €21bn tranche following initial reforms last year. Rome has submitted its second payment request of €21bn, which is currently being assessed by the commission.</p> <p>But with elections set for September 25, questions exist over whether Italy can meet its reform milestones set for December 31 to receive a further €19bn, worth about 1 per cent of gross domestic product. Necessary measures include the adoption of a new competition law, tax reform and an overhaul of judicial procedures to accelerate court trials that are the slowest in Europe.</p> <p>“This makes for a busy schedule of legislation in normal times, let alone when you have an election,” said Ludovico Sapio, economist at Barclays bank.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note on Monday that they saw “significant headwinds” for Italian debt from increased political uncertainty and potential delays in the implementation of recovery fund investments and reforms.</p> <p>Italy's commitments made in return for funds include cutting red tape, bolstering competition in sectors ranging from energy to transport and strengthening public administration. They are designed to raise long-term growth prospects and ensure the sustainability of its public debt, now about 150 per cent of GDP.</p> <p>Although Draghi, former president of the European Central Bank, secured cross-party support for the plan at the helm of his unity government, there are fears that implementation will falter without him, jeopardising reform momentum and fiscal discipline.</p> <p>“Draghi had an essential role,” said Sapio. “With his premature departure, we're now facing untested waters. We're moving from a scenario with a prime minister with a large parliamentary majority — and a strong dedication to the plan — to a new completely unknown setting.”</p> <p>Giorgia Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy, which polls show could be the largest party in parliament after the September elections, told La Stampa newspaper over the weekend of her concerns that the recovery funds were not being used in areas where “Italy is more competitive than others”.</p> <p>Yet any significant disruption or deviation from the reform and investment programme, laid out in a 664-page annex to Rome's deal with the commission, would jeopardise Italy's full access to the funds.</p> <p>Italy would not be the only casualty. Though the fund was agreed as a one-off measure in response to the pandemic-induced economic crisis, advocates of deeper EU fiscal integration see it as a potential precedent for further joint action. If the scheme foundered in Italy, it would increase scepticism in northern European capitals that are deeply suspicious of joint debt issuance. </p> <p>“The whole idea of joint borrowing by the EU is at stake here,” said Luigi Scazzieri, senior fellow at the Center for European Reform think-tank. “The perceived success or failure of the fund depends on whether it seen be successful in Italy, or whether it is seen to be wasteful.”</p> <p>Some Italian analysts say a new administration has a strong incentive to adhere to the plan or face public anger for failing to secure the funds.</p> <p>“The path has been clearly defined,” said Luciano Monti, politics professor at Luiss University in Rome. “We signed a contract . . . and will receive a lot of money: €20bn every semester. That's a good carrot.”</p> <p>The ECB last week raised the stakes for Italy even higher, saying adherence to EU recovery plans would be considered when assessing if a country's debt was eligible for its new bond-buying programme. This transmission protection instrument, or TPI, is designed to counter unwarranted increases in national borrowing costs.</p> <p>The gap in yield between Italy's 10-year debt and that of Germany, a key measure of risk, has widened to about 2.3 percentage points since Draghi's government began wobbling. The so-called spread registered about 1.85 percentage points in early July.</p> <p>Michele Geraci, a former under-secretary at Italy's economic development ministry, said any centre-right coalition government — the most likely outcome on current polling — would remain committed to the plan and may even seek to improve it. “Reform and a more efficient economic system is in the DNA of the centre-right,” he said. “The recovery plan could actually be even enhanced.”</p> <p>Yet Brussels has discouraged member states from trying to renegotiate, and retains discretion over how to respond to such requests, or any failure to meet milestones.</p> <p>Nathalie Tocci, director of the Institute of International Affairs think-tank, said Draghi's exit deprived Italy of an effective advocate in Brussels, which could affect how the commission viewed developments in Rome.</p> <p>The outgoing administration was “the first time we've had government with the credibility, leadership skills and reputation to get good deals for Italy within the EU”, she added.</p> <p>“Given the way the economy is going, these would have been choppier waters to navigate. To navigate them well, you need to know how to play the game. Whoever is going to come next, does not.”</p><p>Source: Amy Kazmin in Rome, Sam Fleming in Brussels and Martin Arnold in Frankfurt 2022 'Doubts over Italy's access to €800bn EU Covid fund after Mario Draghi's exit' FT.com 26 July.
