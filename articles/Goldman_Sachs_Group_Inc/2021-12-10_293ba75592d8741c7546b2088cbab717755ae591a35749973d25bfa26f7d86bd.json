  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>Stanley Cup champions the <strong>Tampa Bay Lightning</strong> are nearing an agreement to sell a minority stake to the private equity firm <strong>Arctos Sports Partners</strong>, making the <strong>National Hockey League</strong> the fourth US professional sports league to embrace institutional ownership. Read the FT story&#xa0;<a href=\"http://ft.com/content/252d8eb0-9478-41c3-a521-8c4c9b34c179\">here</a>.</p> <h2>The legal industry trendsetter follows the crowd</h2> <p><strong>Faiza Saeed</strong>, the first woman to lead the 200-year-old New York law firm <strong>Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore</strong>, is one of Wall Street's top corporate advisers, unpicking knotty situations for clients including <strong>Time Warner</strong> and <strong>Disney</strong>. </p> <p>This week the unpicking was reserved for Cravath itself. </p> <p>The firm <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5d13a9ba-6e91-4063-9e85-b1b8184f9f4a\">unwound</a> its treasured “pure lockstep” pay structure, which pays partners solely based on rank and not performance. </p> <p>It marks a significant change for a firm that has for decades set industry standards on pay and culture, and taken pride in its lockstep model.</p> <p>Cravath's historic decision to abandon the pay model comes as a ferocious bidding war has gripped the industry, with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29b3d982-041d-4452-83f3-bdcb47e3ed99\">salaries propelled higher</a> by the record boom in private equity-fuelled mergers and acquisitions.</p> <p>Rivals <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13696928-86d5-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2\">have been luring</a> partners across the industry and tempting them with eye-popping performance-driven packages — a model dubbed “eat what you kill”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Meanwhile, other firms including <strong>Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz </strong>have proven far more profitable for their partners. Cravath partners took home $4.6m on average last year, compared to $7.5m for partners at Wachtell, according to figures from <strong>The American Lawyer</strong>.</p> <p>“The business is far bigger and more complex than it was when we adopted pure lockstep roughly 50 years ago,” <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/c64a1fd3-3084-46b4-8273-69b2dfeb9332\">Saeed told the FT</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The partnership is three-fold larger, we are close to $1bn in revenue and we operate in a much more competitive market . . . [The new system] adds an ability to reward extraordinary contribution,” she added.</p> <p>Several high-profile departures have rocked Cravath in recent years. </p> <p>In 2016 M&amp;A star <strong>Scott Barshay</strong> jumped ship to <strong>Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison</strong> for a deal worth <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9c96d04-376c-11e8-8eee-e06bde01c544\">more than $10m a year</a>. Kirkland lured litigator <strong>Sandra Goldstein </strong>in 2018 and earlier this year, <strong>Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer</strong> poached dealmaker <strong>Damien Zoubek</strong>.</p> <p>Many of Cravath's younger partners, including some mentored by Saeed, have also been tempted by competitors. The trend was one factor that led to the firm's scheme change, people close to the decision told the FT.</p> <p>Cravath's presiding partner hopes the new system will encourage lawyers young and old to stay at the firm. It also hopes to poach some from its rivals. </p> <p>Whether they can keep up with the juicy pay packages offered by industry leaders remains to be seen.</p> <h2>Big deals Down Under&#xa0;</h2> <p>For a country that's spent most of the past year firmly banning visitors, Australia has been surprisingly open for deals.</p> <p>Take its main airport, which in November welcomed international passengers for the first time in 20 months. Collapsed traveller numbers and revenues at <strong>Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport </strong>didn't deter investors — quite the opposite. &#xa0;</p> <p>A consortium of infrastructure funds, including Melbourne-based <strong>IFM Partners</strong> and New York-based <strong>Global Infrastructure Partners</strong>, bid three times before it landed the A$23.6bn ($17.5bn) deal.</p> <p><br>The buyout is one of several multibillion-dollar takeovers that have propelled M&amp;A in Australia to a record year. A$308bn worth of deals have been signed in 2021 compared with a 10-year average of A$100bn, according to Refinitiv figures. &#xa0;</p> <p>Nic Fildes, the FT's new correspondent for the region, has more <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6cb27f90-5473-41d6-a070-9ec88b802f0d\">here</a>.</p> <p>The dealmaking boom has been driven by low funding costs and pent-up demand for transactions after a quiet 2020. The mighty growth of private capital and a strategy shift by Australia's giant superannuation pension funds has also triggered the wave of activity, forcing buyers to offer hefty premiums.</p> <p>Size has been no limiting factor. &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Square</strong>, the payments company founded by former <strong>Twitter </strong>head <strong>Jack Dorsey</strong>, agreed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9bc49035-87f8-440e-9c20-5af34d40d4ad\">acquire</a> the buy now, pay later group <strong>Afterpay </strong>for A$39bn in August, marking the largest takeover of an Australian company. That was followed by the mining group <strong>BHP</strong>'s decision to combine its petroleum assets with the energy company <strong>Woodside Petroleum </strong>in a deal that valued the merged business at A$41bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Australia's A$3tn pension sector has also been driving the dealmaking frenzy as the country's huge superannuation funds hunt for places to deploy their capital. With demand for deals outstripping supply, the funds have begun teaming up to target companies. In June <strong>Aware Super</strong> and <strong>Macquarie Infrastructure &amp; Real Assets</strong> united to buy the telecoms company <strong>Vocus</strong> for A$3.5bn.</p> <p><strong>Marissa Freund</strong>, head of M&amp;A for <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> in Australia and New Zealand, is one of many bankers enjoying Australia's unexpected dealmaking boom. </p> <p>“I don't see it stopping anytime soon. Long may it continue,” she said. </p> <h2>Disney's new CEO steps into the limelight&#xa0;</h2> <p>After delaying his retirement four times, then spending two years in a “transition” period tussling on and off with his successor, <strong>Bob Iger</strong>, chief executive of <strong>Disney</strong>, is finally leaving the company. </p> <p>The FT spoke with his successor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69e1cc1e-9c64-4000-b47f-a7e448107a5b\"><strong>Bob Chapek</strong></a>, a previously unknown name in Hollywood and on Wall Street, in a series of interviews over the past month. Chapek technically took over in February 2020, but will fully wrench control at the end of this month as Iger steps down as chair of the board. </p> <p>Iger's tenure at Disney was defined by transformative acquisitions. When he first became chief executive the press dismissed him as a “former weatherman”, referencing an early job anchoring an Ithaca, New York television channel. &#xa0;</p> <p>By pulling off several era-defining deals — <strong>Pixar </strong>for $7.4bn, <strong>Lucasfilm </strong>and <strong>Marvel </strong>for $4bn each, and the majority of <strong>21st Century</strong> <strong>Fox </strong>for $71bn — Iger developed one of the most valuable content catalogues in Hollywood history. His dealmaking prowess gave Disney effective control over the box office, taking up nearly half of cinema ticket sales before the pandemic. &#xa0;</p> <p>Chapek's task is to build on that momentum, and carve out his own vision. There are still more deals to be done. &#xa0;</p> <p>Disney's linear TV networks — <strong>Freeform</strong>, <strong>ABC</strong>, <strong>National Geographic</strong> and the <strong>Disney Channel</strong> — would be an obvious place to start, as the company remakes itself as a streaming group. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a53e83ef-9088-4130-8918-a9eb5b9f3a52\"><strong>ESPN</strong></a>, one of Iger's crown jewels, is a trickier decision. ESPN brings in $10bn in revenue a year, but is in irreversible decline, alongside the rest of the traditional television world. &#xa0;</p> <p>Private equity groups have been pitching Disney for years to spin off ESPN. Selling the network would relieve Disney of having to deal with sports' bumpy transition to digital entertainment, and bring in billions of dollars that it could spend on content for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b705a6f-35f6-49cf-883b-0581fbf5ab48\"><strong>Disney+</strong></a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Chapek told the FT he doesn't want to sell. “We feel the Disney brand is broad enough to have an ESPN business under our roof.” He wants to combine ESPN with sports betting (associating gambling with the wholesome Disney brand will “not be harmful”, he told the FT).&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Iger never pulled the trigger, but as more people abandon TV each year, Chapek may need to reconsider. &#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Brunswick </strong>has hired <strong>Dan Lambeth</strong> as a partner in London focusing on ESG issues. He joins from <strong>JPMorgan</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Bank of America</strong> has appointed <strong>Andrew Karp</strong> as the bank's head of global corporate and investment banking for ESG advisory and financing solutions. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>The University of Texas/Texas A&amp;M Investment Management Company</strong> has promoted <strong>Rich Hall</strong> to chief investment officer.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Blackstone</strong>'s alternative asset management division has hired <strong>David Ben-Ur </strong>as chief investment officer of its hedge fund solutions unit and <strong>Atish Nigam</strong> as chief investment officer of its special situations investing business. Ben-Ur joins from <strong>CAM Capital</strong>, while Nigam joins from <strong>Appaloosa Management</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Billionaire betting </strong>By day he runs an options trading firm, by night he makes wild bets like floating $2.5bn on the outcome of the US presidential election.
