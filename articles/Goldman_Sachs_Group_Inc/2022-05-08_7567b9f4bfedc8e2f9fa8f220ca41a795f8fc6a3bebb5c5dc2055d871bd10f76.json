  "title": "Finance sector pay: M&A boom boosts bankers' bonuses",
  "text": "<p>Back in the 19th century, the low-paid worked long hours while the leisured classes <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2020/01/The-times-they-arent-a-changin.pdf\">skived</a>. These days such sought-after jobs as investment banking require <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0556d66a-394d-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4\">round the clock</a> toil. But pay is high — Goldman Sachs analysts' start at $110,000 — and rising. After an unexceptional decade, pay inflation in the finance sector is roaring ahead. That sounds good news for some, but bad for income distribution.</p> <p>The rising cost of living has <a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2022/0215\">erased</a> recent wage gains for most US workers. Not so on Wall Street. The <a href=\"https://ips-dc.org/wall-street-bonuses-soar-by-20-percent-nearly-5-times-the-increase-in-us-average-weekly-earnings/\">average bonus</a> rose by a fifth to $257,500 in 2021. In the UK, pay in the finance sector shot up by 23 per cent in real terms in the 26 months to&#xa0;February, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The average real increase in UK pay was just 7 per cent. </p> <p>Highly paid bankers are less numerous in the EU. Stringent post-financial crisis <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a553f78-4624-4af2-b481-0f7518c4dd27\">pay caps</a> play some part, as in Ireland where there is a €500,000 limit. The 3,519 UK bankers earning more than €1mn was more than twice the number in the rest of the EU in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/document_library/Publications/Reports/2021/1018449/Report%20on%20High%20Earners%202019.pdf\">according</a> to the European Banking Authority.</p> <p>Justifications for bumper pay rises are not obvious from the sector-wide data. Overall, the finance sector's output did not increase more than other sectors during the pandemic. Nor was the labour market particularly tight. </p> <p>But investment banking has been on a tear. Banks competed with each other to recruit enough workers to cope with a torrent of initial public offerings and deals. In January Deutsche Bank chief executive Christian Sewing fretted about the “increasingly intense war for talent” after a sharp increase in payroll costs dented&#xa0; the investment banking division's profits.</p> <p>All this does nothing for income equality. The finance sector accounts for nearly a third of employees in the <a href=\"https://ifs.org.uk/inequality/top-income-inequality-and-tax-policy/\">top 1 per cent</a> of UK earnings. No surprise then that the pay of the top 1 per cent of employees grew by nearly 14 per cent in the 26 months to&#xa0;February 2022,&#xa0; compared with 10-12 per cent across most of the earnings distribution.</p> <p>The bonanza's benefits are not confined to bankers. Banking accounted for&#xa0; 6.7 per cent of all employment tax receipts last year, though it employs just 1.2 per cent of the UK workforce. Even so, the reversal of the pre-Covid-19 trend towards greater pay equality is politically awkward — especially after the pandemic showed that the most essential jobs are often the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b34269a-73f8-11ea-95fe-fcd274e920ca\">least valued</a>.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Finance sector pay: M&amp;A boom boosts bankers' bonuses' FT.com 8 May.
