  "text": "<p>\n  The Covid-19 pandemic exposed the need for more sustainable and inclusive economic growth, and like a lot of chief executives, I spent much of 2021 thinking about how businesses can further catalyze this growth in the communities where we operate. One thought-provoking book on the challenge we face is Alec Ross's \"The Raging 2020s: Companies, Countries, People -- and the Fight for Our Future.\" Mr. Ross argues that the balance of rights and responsibilities among businesses, governments and individuals -- what he calls the \"social contract\" -- has been thrown off kilter. The path forward is unclear. Mr. Ross contends that while businesses have more power to shape our lives than ever before, there are also challenges, like climate change, that require the private and public sector to work together. What's needed, he writes, is \"to take our existing social contract . . . and repair it to meet the 21st century.\" Mr. Ross makes his case with verve, and his book challenged me to think through my views on a range of issues. I don't agree with all of his conclusions, but I think he's asking all the right questions, and anyone interested in building a more sustainable planet should put it on their reading list. </p><p>\n  -- Mr. Solomon is chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  James Stavridis </p><p>\n  In this heartless year, I read a handful of books that inspired me. I was an intercollegiate tennis player and actually hit a few balls with Billie Jean King at a summer sports camp, so for me, her wonderful memoir, \"All In,\" was a natural. The book is at once an anthem for gay and women's rights, a time machine to the 1960s and '70s, and a first-rate sports story. On the fiction side, it was so sad to read the last John le Carre book, \"Silverview,\" which was as good as ever -- a twisty spy novel without a gun in sight. We will miss him more than we know. And for mind-bending alternate history, it is hard to beat \"The Kingdoms\" by Natasha Pulley, about a parallel world in which Lord Nelson loses the Battle of Trafalgar, allowing Napoleon to conquer 19th-century Britain. Finally, the best crafted book of the year, one that made me think about what an inadequate writer I am, is \"A Swim in a Pond in the Rain\" by George Saunders, about how the fit and finish of fiction was created by Russia's master writers. </p><p>\n  -- Adm. Stavridis (U.S. Navy, retired) is the former Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and co-author, with Elliot Ackerman, of \"2034,\" a novel. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Francis Suarez </p><p>\n  Chris Whipple's \"The Gatekeepers\" offers a refreshingly bipartisan, conceptual and operational assessment of the role of the White House chief of staff. The function and scope of every chief of staff is defined by the needs of the president and the circumstances of the time. Mr. Whipple identifies and assesses the key characteristics and practices of a successful chief of staff within government and the modern political arena. Each one -- the book examines every chief of staff from H.R. Haldeman to John Kelly -- played a quiet yet consequential role for his president. Each dealt with different challenges and different circumstances, and each held different skills and strengths that advanced or restrained his president's agenda. All White House chiefs of staff leave an indelible mark on the history, politics and political landscape of America. Presidential power rests on the power to persuade, Mr. Whipple shows, but the chief of staff's job is to turn persuasion into action. </p><p>\n  -- Mr. Suarez is the mayor of Miami. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  John B. Taylor </p><p>\n  Getting good economic ideas into practical policy is essential, but it requires a one-two punch: first, explaining the ideas so virtually anyone can understand; second, finding ways to implement them. The year 2021 delivered exactly that old one-two, with Michael S. Weisbach's \"The Economist's Craft\" doing the explaining and Markus K. Brunnermeier's \"The Resilient Society\" doing the implementing. Mr. Weisbach shows how to understand economics in a way that's entertaining for anyone who has ever been a student, or simply likes to read, write or talk economics. It is aimed at economics professors, and appears to give the inside scoop on teaching. In reality, anyone with a bit of curiosity is enticed to look at how it's done. Mr. Brunnermeier takes ideas and applies them to the most pressing problem of the day: how to make the economy resilient so that it bounces back even after being hit hard by shocks like Covid-19 and its variants, or even from excesses of monetary and fiscal policy. It too is written for a wide-ranging audience of politicians, journalists, readers and watchers. </p><p>\n  -- Mr. Taylor is a professor of economics at Stanford and a former undersecretary of the Treasury for international affairs. </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Tiphanie Yanique </p><p>\n  Thank God for Alexis Pauline Gumbs's \"Undrowned: Black Feminist Lessons From Marine Mammals.\" The whole concept is something a cynic might dismiss: What could be feminist aboutmarine mammals? Is there really such a thing as un-drowning? Is any of this particularly black? And if this book is only offering lessons for black feminists, then the rest of us don't need to bother, right? Except, nah. The book is for everyone who believes or wants to believe that the world is not here to destroy human beings, but to save us; and that humanity may not be designed to destroy the world and ourselves, but that we humans are meant to be in grace with the world and each other. During this second wave of the pandemic, and in the wake of various reckonings about the value of black lives, when I have been so demoralized, so lacking in hope, so miserable that we are still as we are, it has been a saving grace to have Ms. Gumbs tell me, tell all her readers: \"I want to live in love as home, I want to live in it . . . I want to earn the right to say it to you. Love.\" </p><p>\n  -- Ms. Yanique is the author, most recently, of \"Monster in the Middle,\" a novel. </p><p></p>",
