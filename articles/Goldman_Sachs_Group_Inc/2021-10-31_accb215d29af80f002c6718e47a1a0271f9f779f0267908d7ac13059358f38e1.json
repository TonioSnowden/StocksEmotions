  "title": "Will the Fed join a hawkish tilt among global central banks?",
  "text": "<p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce at the end of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday that it will start reducing its pandemic-era bond purchases. But the question remains how hawkish policymakers sound when making the announcement. </p> <p>As higher levels of inflation have persisted, central banks around the globe have begun to signal a willingness to raise interest rates earlier than expected to curb rising prices. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c934ec44-cc9f-4ec8-8ff2-8f8d6e226c04\">Bank of Canada</a> this week announced that it will end its asset purchases, but also updated its inflation forecast, which could potentially pull forward its timeline for interest rate increases. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56f728dc-70b7-463c-9b3e-98ea69de16e2\">Bank of England</a> in September forecast that inflation would rise above 4 per cent, which it said strengthened the case for tighter monetary policy in the next few years. </p> <p>“It would be a surprise and disappointment to the market if the Fed does not begin to taper,” said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein. “What we're seeing is many central banks moving in a more hawkish direction. And I expect the Fed to do that too,” Winograd said. </p> <p>In September, growth in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4581bd5d-0771-44ca-93ac-13c4ed2a66be\">US consumer prices</a> accelerated to a 13-year high, and companies in their quarterly earnings reports have been highlighting price pressures. Currently, markets are betting that the US will begin raising interest rates in September 2022. </p> <p>Next week will also bring the latest monthly jobs report, which economists polled by Refinitiv forecast will show an addition of about 400,000 positions in October, up from 194,000 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57ed92ab-994b-4fed-b422-518a0562c698\">in September.</a> Previous sluggishness in jobs growth is not expected to prevent the Fed from tapering this week, but evidence of further weakness in Friday's report could temper expectations of rate increases. <em>Kate Duguid</em></p> <h2>Is the Bank of England ready for lift-off?</h2> <p>Investors are betting that UK interest rates will rise on Thursday as the Bank of England battles inflationary pressures that have proved more persistent than expected.</p> <p>The shift in market pricing has been dramatic since the BoE said at its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56f728dc-70b7-463c-9b3e-98ea69de16e2\">previous meeting</a> in September that a rate increase before the end of 2021 was a possibility — until then investors had thought tightening was off the table until next year. </p> <p>A succession of speeches by policymakers including governor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/160e6e1a-2584-4013-8102-3ae5cfadb1d8\">Andrew Bailey</a> has done little to rein in speculation that a rate rise is imminent, prompting a growing number of investment banks to forecast a lift in rates this week to 0.25 per cent from the current record low of 0.1 per cent. </p> <p>“The BoE will surely find it hard to not follow through with a November hike having talked the market, deliberately or not, into pricing it,” said Rob Wood, UK economist at Bank of America.</p> <p>Some economists think the BoE will go even further, with Deutsche Bank predicting that its policymakers will end the bond-buying programme a month early in addition to raising rates.</p> <p>Investors will also be watching carefully for signs of what comes next. Markets have already priced in a further 1 percentage point of rate increases by the end of 2022. </p> <p>“We think the BoE will give markets some signal around the pace of hikes — at least for the near term,” said Deutsche Bank's Sanjay Raja. <em>Tommy Stubbington</em></p> <h2>Will the Australian central bank abandon ‘yield curve control' measures? </h2> <p>A key Australian bond yield flew well above the central bank's target this week, fuelling intense speculation that it will put an end to one of its programmes aimed at keeping a lid on borrowing costs. </p> <p>The yield on a bond maturing in April 2024 surged to 0.8 per cent on Friday, well past the Reserve Bank of Australia's 0.1 per cent target. The increase followed the release of data showing that a core measure of inflation jumped within policymakers' target range of <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/inflation/inflation-target.html\">2 to 3 per cent</a> for the first time in six years. </p> <p>The sharp rise in yield on the April 2024 bond, which points to a fall in price, ignited expectations among some traders and investors that the central bank will abandon its “yield curve control” policy, which it had reaffirmed as recently as October 5. </p> <p>“The RBA appears to be dropping its ‘yield curve control' (YCC) policy,” economists at Goldman Sachs said. “Our base case is now that the RBA acknowledges this at November's board meeting, but it's a close call and we see a 40 per cent chance that the RBA comes in to defend the target next week and delays change in YCC policy until next year.”</p> <p>Investors will also be looking to see if the bank announces plans to slow down its purchases of government bonds, which are currently slated to run at A$4bn a week until mid-February 2022. <em>Harriet Clarfelt and</em> <em>Anthony Klan</em></p><p>Source: Kate Duguid, Tommy Stubbington, Harriet Clarfelt and Anthony Klan 2021 'Will the Fed join a hawkish tilt among global central banks?'
