  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Smart-Lock Maker Latch to Go Public  ----  By Bowdeya Tweh and Konrad Putzier",
  "text": "<p>   Latch Inc., a maker of smart locks and building-management software, plans to go public by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company backed by a real-estate giant, the latest startup looking to use a so-called blank-check vehicle to cash in on strong investor interest in tech-enabled businesses. </p><p>   The merger will unite venture-capital-backed Latch with TS Innovation Acquisitions Corp., a special-purpose acquisition company sponsored by New York commercial real-estate firm Tishman Speyer Properties LP that raised $300 million late last year, the companies said Monday. The deal, which values Latch at $1.56 billion, is expected to close in the second quarter, and Latch is expected to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol LTCH, they said. </p><p>   SPACs have increasingly gained favor over the past year among companies looking to go public and large investors looking to partner with them. These SPACs, which go public with no assets and then merge with private companies, raised a record $82.1 billion in 2020, more than six times the prior year's total, according to Dealogic data. Nearly 300 SPACs are seeking deals, armed with about $90 billion in cash. </p><p>   Another tech company, Taboola.com Ltd., also on Monday revealed plans to go public in a SPAC deal. The content-recommendation startup behind those tempting \"around the web\" promoted stories said it would merge with ION Acquisition Corp. in a deal that will bring in $545 million for Taboola and value it at $2.6 billion. Taboola's SPAC plans come months after its plan to acquire competitor Outbrain Inc. was called off in September. </p><p>   Latch, founded in 2014 as Latchable, is set to net around $450 million in cash from the SPAC and other investors including funds managed by BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Management &amp; Research Co. and D1 Capital Partners LP, according to an investor presentation. </p><p>   The deal would also be a windfall for Tishman Speyer. The company, which owns properties including Rockefeller Center and 200 Park Avenue in New York, is set to receive a roughly 4% stake in Latch, worth around $60 million, as de facto payment for sponsoring the SPAC. </p><p>   Tishman Speyer is at the forefront of a small but growing group of real-estate companies getting into the SPAC business. Property-services giant CBRE Group Inc. launched a $350 million SPAC in December, while hotel-and-private-equity mogul Barry Sternlicht recently filed for his third such vehicle. Large property owners have started pouring money into real-estate startups in recent years, seeking to profit from rising valuations and modernize their own buildings. </p><p>   Before launching the SPAC, Tishman Speyer had invested in about a dozen so-called prop-tech companies including Latch, Rob Speyer, Tishman's chief executive, said. Mr. Speyer said that the pandemic has accelerated demand for real-estate technology products like Latch, and that he hopes to use Tishman Speyer's expertise and connections to help Latch expand into new countries and new building types, such as offices. \"Real estate has been an industry that has been technology-resistant for decades,\" said Mr. Speyer, who will also join Latch's board of directors. \"It's hitting this period of massive disruption. It's entrepreneurs like Luke and companies like Latch that are leading this wave of disruption.\" </p><p>    Luke Schoenfelder, chief executive of Latch, said the company and its adviser, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., evaluated more than 10 prospective deals. Ultimately, he said, Latch chose Tishman Speyer because of factors including its industry reach and a desire to remain independent. Latch sees its future in providing software-as-a-service, supplying both its LatchOS building-operating system and its hardware to real-estate managers. The average contract length for its software is more than six years, according to Latch. </p><p>   Mr. Schoenfelder said 2020 was Latch's strongest sales year, helped by the pandemic's spurring interest in tools such as contactless door and elevator controls. Latch has more than 200 employees and was last valued at $454 million as of 2019, according to PitchBook Data Inc. \"There's a lot of space for us to expand,\" Mr. Schoenfelder told the Journal, noting Latch's products are installed in less than 1% of the 47 million rental units in the U.S. </p><p>   Growing is critical to Latch's path to profitability. It had a loss of $61 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization last year, according to an investor presentation, and doesn't project being profitable by that measure until the end of 2024. </p><p>   Net revenue was $18 million in 2020, up from $15 million a year earlier, Latch reported. The company forecasts its revenue will nearly triple this year and reach $877 million in 2025. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Patience Haggin contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
