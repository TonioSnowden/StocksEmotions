  "text": "<p>Nonetheless the carnage hasn't been evenly distributed. The Bank of Thailand, ensconced in Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, is betting a rebound in tourism will rescue the nation's currency -- down over 8% against the dollar this year -- without forcing it to dramatically raise rates. India, with its big dependence on imported energy, is in a tight corner but could catch a break if Western economies cool and pull down energy prices with them. Currencies of commodity exporters such as Indonesia and Malaysia have fared slightly better.</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, gained 10% so far in 2022. And with the Federal Reserve determined to continue tightening rates in the face of stubborn inflation and rising chances of a global recession, investors are likely to cling to the dollar for a long time. The best most Asian central banks can hope for is orderly depreciation.</p><p>India is under particular pressure as a large commodity importer but has taken active steps to curb the scale of capital outflows -- including some market-friendly changes. Last week, the Reserve Bank of India relaxed debt-market rules for foreign portfolio investors and allowed commercial banks to raise interest rates on nonresidents' foreign-currency deposits. India's foreign-exchange reserves are ample at $588.31 billion as of July 1, but they fell by over $45 billion in the past half year. The Indian rupee is down about 6.6% since the beginning of 2022, according to FactSet, testing a series of record lows in the past few weeks.</p><p>Currencies of neighboring emerging economies such as Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia were routed in the past several weeks. The Indonesian rupiah is down 4.4% since the beginning of April, while the Thai baht is down 8% and Malaysia's ringgit is down 5.5%. Their foreign-exchange reserves took a hit, with Thailand being the worst affected. Its reserves fell by nearly a 10th during the past six months. Thailand's central bank has nonetheless been willing to tolerate a big depreciation given the risk that sharp rate rises would pose to a still-weak economy: With most pandemic restrictions removed for vaccinated travelers, it is pegging its hopes on a strong rebound for its tourist sector. Before the pandemic, around 20% of Thailand's economy was tied to tourism.</p><p>Indonesia's currency has performed better than its peers mainly because of strong commodity exports. Following a brief export ban in early 2022, the nation's coal exports surged -- exports of coal and lignite in May were valued at about $5 billion, according to data from CEIC, more than double the same month in 2019. That gave Indonesia's central bank a bit more wiggle room: It vowed to keep an eye on the weakening currency but resisted raising rates so far. Goldman Sachs expects Bank Indonesia to kick-start its tightening cycle in August, delivering a cumulative 1.25 percentage points of rate rises this year.</p><p>Asian central banks are walking a narrow path between rates, inflation and capital outflows -- with a fair amount of improvisation and hope in the policy mix too. Whatever they do, a real respite awaits an end to the Fed tightening cycle. For now at least, the dollar remains unassailable.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
