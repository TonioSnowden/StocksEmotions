  "text": "<p>Patrick Jenkins' <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0e22154-ac2e-4e48-8413-4fd33cb16915\">June 21 column</a> (“Petty protectionism will not help European bank prospects”) points out the many flaws in the prohibition on 10 global banks' participation in the EU Recovery Fund bond syndication. The ostensible reason for the bar was that those banks had repeatedly violated antitrust rules. That is true: many global banks are recidivist violators of antitrust/market manipulation laws — for example, JPMorgan Chase's recent criminal guilty pleas regarding the US Treasuries and precious metals markets. </p> <p>However, antitrust actions are just a small fraction of decades of ongoing egregious illegal and criminal conduct by these banks including, for example, Goldman Sachs' recent criminal plea in a global foreign bribery and money laundering case. Better Markets released a report that detailed almost 400 major legal actions against just the six largest US banks over the last 20 years, which resulted in fines and settlements of almost $200bn. That report also showed that not only are global banks repeat lawbreakers, but their illegal activities have increased since the 2008 financial crash. </p> <p>It is beyond question that fines and even criminal charges are little more than a nuisance cost of doing business for these gigantic global banks. If any other business had such a shocking record, it is unlikely they would still be in business. Thus, while the rational for this particular prohibition may have been a pretext, it is long past time that governments and others take global banks' illegal conduct seriously and deny those banks lucrative business such as the bond syndication. That loss of material business might actually reduce their illegal behaviour.</p> <p><strong>Dennis M Kelleher</strong> <br><em>President and CEO, Better Markets Washington, DC, US </em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Fines do little to deter banks' illegal conduct' FT.com 27 June.
