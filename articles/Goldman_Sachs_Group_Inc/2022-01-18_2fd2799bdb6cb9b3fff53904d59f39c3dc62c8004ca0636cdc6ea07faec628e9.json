  "title": "Omicron's Impact on Oil Demand Weaker Than Expected in Late 2021; Uncertainties remain over new variants of the virus and renewed mobility restrictions, cartel says",
  "text": "<p>For the year as a whole, OPEC left its forecast unchanged, saying demand grew by 5.7 million barrels a day, averaging 96.4 million barrels a day. While the Omicron variant had a limited impact on demand in the final quarter of the year, OPEC said demand in the third quarter was 240,000 barrels a day weaker than it had previously expected, reflecting the latest available data for that period.</p><p>The oil producers group also kept its forecasts for demand growth in 2022 steady at 4.2 million barrels a day but cautioned that the emergence of other variants presented a continued risk to its forecasts and oil demand.</p><p>\"While the impact of the Omicron variant is projected to be mild and short-lived, uncertainties remain regarding new variants and renewed mobility restrictions, amid an otherwise steady global economic recovery,\" the OPEC report said.</p><p>Oil prices climbed to their highest level in seven years on Tuesday. Futures for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude benchmark, added 1.9% to end at $85.43 a barrel, the highest closing level since October 2014, when OPEC started a price war with U.S. shale producers that sent oil markets into a yearslong slump. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.2% to close at $87.51 a barrel, also a seven-year high.</p><p>A missile and drone attack on the United Arab Emirates by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels was responsible for sending prices higher Tuesday, as investors worried about the threat of damage to the Gulf nation's energy infrastructure.</p><p>Wider concerns, however, have focussed on the capacity of oil-producing countries in OPEC and their allies such as Russia to increase production in line with demand growth that has proved more robust than expected.</p><p>In its report, OPEC, citing secondary sources, said its own crude oil production rose by 170,000 barrels a day in December, led largely by Saudi Arabia and Angola. Production in Libya, whose oil industry has been beset by disruptions from local militias, slumped by 84,000 barrels a day while Nigeria's output also fell.</p><p>OPEC said oil inventories in the weather nations that make up the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development fell by 16 million barrels in November to 2.72 billion barrels.</p><p>In a note to clients Monday, Goldman Sachs analysts said they expect oil prices to rise to $100 a barrel in the third quarter of the year, before topping $105 a barrel in early 2023. The bank said it expected a combination of robust demand and lackluster supply increase would see oil stockpiles in OECD nations fall to their lowest level since 2000 by the summer.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at William.Horner@wsj.com</p><p>Omicron's Impact on Oil Demand Weaker Than Expected in Late 2021</p>",
