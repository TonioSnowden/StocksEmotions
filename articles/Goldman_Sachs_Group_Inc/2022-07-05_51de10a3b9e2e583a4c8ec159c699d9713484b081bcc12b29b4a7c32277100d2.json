  "title": "U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak Resigns in Blow to Boris Johnson's Government; Treasury chief and Health Secretary Sajid Javid, two of Johnson's most senior ministers, both quit his cabinet",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Sunak said in his resignation letter that the public expected the government to be \"conducted properly, competently and seriously.\" Mr. Javid in his letter said that he could \"no longer in good conscience\" continue serving in Mr. Johnson's government. Downing Street declined to comment.</p><p>The catalysts for the resignations are a series of scandals—notably over parties held in Downing Street during Covid-19 lockdowns—and growing unease in the ruling Conservative Party about both Mr. Johnson's conduct in office and how he intends to manage a snowballing economic crisis. Inflation rose to 9.1% last month, its highest level in 40 years.</p><p>This combination of factors now means that Mr. Johnson's future as prime minister looks extremely uncertain. It also lays bare the challenge Mr. Johnson faces to hold together a voter base that spans traditional fiscal conservatives and the blue-collar workers who voted for the Tories in the last election amid a series of tax increases.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Johnson survived a no-confidence vote held by the Conservative Party in which 41% of his lawmakers voted to oust him, a surprisingly large number. The no-confidence vote was in part brought about by the series of parties that were held in Downing Street during Covid-19 lockdowns. Mr. Johnson promised lawmakers that he would ensure his Downing Street operation was no longer plagued by scandal. However just this week Mr. Johnson apologized after a senior lawmaker in his party quit for allegedly groping two men.</p><p>\"After all the sleaze, the scandals and the failure, it's clear that this Government is now collapsing,\" said opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer.</p><p>The loss of Mr. Sunak, a former Goldman Sachs banker who was until recently tipped to replace Mr. Johnson, is a particular blow as the country enters a period of deep economic uncertainty. The Bank of England expects inflation to hit 11% later this year and some economists predict a looming recession. In his resignation letter, Mr. Sunak said that a low-tax, high-growth economy could be delivered only \"if we are prepared to work hard, make sacrifices and take difficult decisions.\" The amount of tax the government collects relative to the economy's size is on course to be the biggest since the early 1950s, according to the U.K.'s Office for Budget Responsibility. The government has pledged to reduce some taxes before the next election, which is due no later than January 2025.</p><p>On paper, Mr. Johnson's hand looks strong. He presides over an 80-seat majority in Parliament, and under Conservative Party rules there can't be another leadership challenge for a year. The next general election doesn't have to be held until early 2025. However, rebels in his party are considering whether to change the Conservative Party rules so that another leadership challenge can be held sooner, according to people close to them.</p><p>This week Mr. Johnson faced criticism from Tories over the resignation of a deputy whip, Chris Pincher, who allegedly groped two men and has allegedly made several unwanted advances on men in the past. Mr. Johnson's team initially put out a statement saying he had no prior knowledge of Mr. Pincher's prior behavior. The government said Tuesday that Mr. Johnson had been briefed on this behavior back in 2019 but said he had subsequently forgotten about it. Mr. Pincher has apologized for the behavior.</p><p>More on Boris Johnson's Government</p><p>Read related content selected by WSJ editors</p><p>* Fresh Scandal Threatens to Tarnish Boris Johnson and Tory Party (July 4)</p><p>* Boris Johnson's Conservatives Suffer Blow in U.K. Special Elections (June 24)</p><p>* Johnson Survives No-Confidence Vote Over Lockdown Parties (June 6)</p><p>* Johnson Urges Lawmakers to Move On After Damning Report on Lockdown Parties (May 25)</p><p>Write to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com</p><p>U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak Resigns in Blow to Boris Johnson's Government</p>",
