  "title": "Business News: Deal Creates New Investment Firm --- MSD Partners and BDT unite to serve family- and founder- led business owners",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Dell, whose family office, MSD Capital, was the genesis of MSD Partners and remains the largest investor in its funds, will chair the new firm's advisory board. Mr. Trott will be the largest single shareholder of the merged entity, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Mr. Trott spent roughly a quarter-century at Goldman before founding BDT in 2009. At Goldman, he earned plaudits from Warren Buffett, advising on some of the famed investor's biggest deals and helping to secure his 2008 investment in Goldman.</p><p>Based in Chicago, BDT specializes in advising founder- and family-owned businesses in areas including deals, succession and estate planning. It also invests in them through more than $33 billion in funds it manages, the majority of which has been raised from investors who are business owners themselves. The firm recently disclosed that it has raised $10.4 billion of what is expected to be a new $12 billion-to-$13 billion vehicle.</p><p>In a recent example of the kind of deal BDT advises on, it counseled the family of Patagonia founder Yvon Chouinard on its move to transfer ownership of the outdoor clothing company to a trust and a nonprofit organization.</p><p>MSD Partners was founded in 2009 when the investors running Mr. Dell's family office realized that others might want to invest alongside him. The firm manages more than $20 billion across private equity, private credit, real estate and growth equity.</p><p>When Mr. Lemkau left his role as co-head of investment banking at Goldman to become CEO of MSD Partners around the end of 2020 -- having also spent more than 25 years there -- Mr. Trott was one of the people he turned to for advice.</p><p>\"The more I talked with Byron about MSD and what it could become, the more I saw elements that fit with that vision in BDT,\" Mr. Lemkau said.</p><p>After he joined, he asked Mr. Trott to speak to MSD employees about how BDT cultivates relationships with the families in its network, which include the Walton, Pritzker and Mars families. Mr. Trott, who had been seeking to add credit and real-estate investing to his firm's offerings, asked Mr. Lemkau to talk to people at BDT about MSD's businesses in those areas.</p><p>The two leaders realized that their businesses were complementary. MSD has traditional credit funds, and its real-estate investments, including the Four Seasons Maui and the Four Seasons Hualalai in Hawaii, are part of a permanent-capital vehicle that allows them to be held in perpetuity. Its private-equity and growth-equity investments, by contrast, aren't housed in a fund structure, allowing them to combine with BDT's investment business without the new firm needing to maintain competing funds.</p><p>\"Where they were, we weren't, and they have what our clients want\" in terms of credit and real-estate offerings, Mr. Trott said.</p><p>He said MSD's technology-investing expertise and Mr. Dell's deep ties to other technology founders will bring a new dimension to BDT's investing and the next generation of wealth into the combined firm's network.</p>",
