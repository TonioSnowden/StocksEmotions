  "title": "Residents-Only Restaurants in Luxury Towers Were Struggling to Break Even. Then Covid Hit. The pandemic forced many private restaurants to close, even as homeowners continue paying for them.",
  "text": "<p>For years, private restaurants have been a sought-after amenity at some of the country's most expensive condominiums and gated communities. But by and large, residents-only restaurantsdon't make money. The pandemic has exposed the financial vulnerability of these restaurants, which are heavily subsidized by common charges and other fees paid by building owners. Still, many residents say it's a price they are willing to pay for the exclusivity, safety and convenience of a private dining experience.</p><p>While some of New York's most exclusive prewar cooperatives have long had private dining rooms, the concept of residents-only restaurants took off at the luxury Manhattan condominium 15 Central Park Westin the mid-2000s. In recent years, developers have tapped celebrity chefs to design exclusive menus for well-heeled owners at buildings such as Manhattan's 432 Park Avenue, where Michelin-starred chef Shaun Hergatt oversees the restaurant, and 220 Central Park South, where Jean-Georges Vongerichten has a restaurant for residents and their guests only. The Mandarin Oriental Residences Fifth Avenue will have a private restaurant by Daniel Boulud. When fully completed, Central Park Tower in New York will have rotating chefs at a private restaurant and ballroom on the building's 100th floor.</p><p>To make these arrangements work, most condo associations pay the chef or restaurateur a management fee and, in some cases, a percentage of top-line sales, said Arlene Spiegel, a New York-based restaurant consultant. Celebrity chefs can command six figures to create a menu and appear at special events, and they often get a signing bonus. How much time the chef actually spends in the kitchen depends on their arrangement with the building.</p><p>Michael Shvo, developer of the Mandarin Oriental Residences, said simply having a restaurant isn't enough to appeal to sophisticated buyers. \"New York has some of the greatest food offerings in the country,\" he said. \"So the offering at your residence has to be great\" for people to want to dine there regularly. Mr. Shvo is also developing a Mandarin Oriental Residences in Beverly Hills, which will have a public restaurant by Mr. Boulud at the base. Residents will have food service from the restaurant at the pool and lounge.</p><p>Mr. Mina operated residents-only restaurants at Millennium Partners condominiums in both Boston and San Francisco before the Boston location closed. He said the benefit to chefs is the opportunity to develop relationships with loyal clientele. \"Our business is a relationship business,\" said Mr. Mina, who has 38 restaurants around the U.S. and in Dubai.</p><p>But given the limited audience, most private restaurants simply aim to break even, said Ms. Spiegel. In addition to the prices paid by diners for their meals, they rely on residents' common charges to help carry the business.</p><p>At 432 Park Avenue, residents initially paid $1,200 a year for the restaurant when the building debuted in 2015. As of 2021, the fee is $15,000 a year and the hours have been reduced because of Covid, according to people familiar with the building.</p><p>At 220 Central Park South, developer Vornado Realty Trust projected $500,000 in dining room expenses for its first year of operations, according to the building's offering plan. In the offering plan for Central Park Tower, Extell projected restaurant expenses of $375,000 during the first year of operations; each unit owner will be assessed $2,000 annually to reduce the restaurant's operating deficit.</p><p>At Miami's Porsche Design Tower, developer Gil Dezer said the annual budget for Fuel, the building's private restaurant, is around $1.5 million a year. That is offset by $650,000 in subsidies from the building's 130 unit owners, whose annual common charges include approximately $5,000 for the restaurant. The cost per unit breaks down to roughly $400 monthly, Mr. Dezer said. \"What that gets them is the restaurant and bar that are open all the time, with the chef they know,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Dezer said he originally wanted to hire a celebrity chef, but ultimately didn't in order to keep costs down. \"My take personally is not to stick the association with a bill,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Mina said his private restaurants made sense because they were connected to restaurants that were open to the public: Pabu Izakaya, which is temporarily closed, is at the base of Millennium Tower Boston, and San Francisco's International Smoke is at the base of the Millennium condominium there. He had a finishing kitchen in each of the residential towers and a full production kitchen downstairs, which allowed him to offer a \"dynamic\" menu with a variety of dishes. He was also able to move staff from one restaurant to the other, if necessary. Residents frequented his restaurants downstairs, he said, which boosted those businesses.</p><p>One reason Mina at the Tower didn't reopen, Mr. Mina said, is that Pabu still hasn't returned, and he's not sure it will. Without Pabu, he said he would have had to offer a narrower selection at Millennium Tower, so the board went with another operator.</p><p>Like all restaurants, private eateries faced an added financial challenge during Covid when some had to close temporarily and shift to outdoor dining. At Ballerina, the private restaurant at Oceana Bal Harbour in Miami, revenue for 2020 was down 32% from what was projected, said Ernesto Cohan, the building's sales director. Ballerina never closed completely, he said, but it moved all dining outside when the pandemic hit, and temporarily prohibited residents from inviting guests. Mr. Cohan said the restaurant also cut back its hours, only serving breakfast and lunch for about five months; it allowed guests for dinner by May 2021. Pre-Covid, Ballerina served around 800 meals a week, and as of mid-December, volume was almost back to normal.</p><p>However, Mr. Cohan said the drop in business didn't impact the building's overall budget because other expenses fell.</p><p>Homeowners say they like the cachet and convenience of private restaurants with big-name chefs.</p><p>Mickey DeMatteis, a 65-year-old retired Apple executive, said he eats five meals a week at the private restaurants at Moonlight Basin, a community in Big Sky, Mont., where he and his wife, Lisa Merkel, 57, purchased a second family home for $3.5 million in 2020. Mr. DeMatteis said Big Sky has a handful of restaurants, but during the winter it can be a treacherous drive down a mountain road into town. \"It's not something you want to do consistently,\" he said.</p><p>Moonlight Basin homeowners are required to pay a $125,000 initiation fee to join the club that operates the three private restaurants, plus $9,000 in annual dues. Meals at the restaurants aren't included, but Mr. DeMatteis said prices are \"competitive\" and the community is \"non-pretentious\" and friendly.</p><p>During Covid, Mr. Dezer said Fuel's popularity shot up as delivery orders \"went through the roof.\" Although the restaurant was physically closed for several weeks in March 2020, the building retained roughly 18 restaurant staffers, although it reassigned some to jobs like security and receiving. Mr. Dezer said Fuel did approximately $1.2 million in sales in 2020. \"That was actually one of our better years, because everyone was trapped at home,\" he said, but the restaurant still lost around $300,000 for the year.</p><p>The residents-only restaurant at 15 Central Park West ordered things like milk, flour and bread for residents when Covid made it difficult to find staples in stores, said Noel Berk, 76, a real-estate agent and resident of the building, who bought a $3.2-million unit there in 2008.</p><p>Residents must spend a minimum of $1,200 a year at the restaurant. Ms. Berk said she thinks that amount is more than reasonable. She eats at the restaurant, or orders food to be delivered, two to three times a week, and said she is partial to the thin-crust pizza. \"I know where it's being made, I know who's making it, I know it has the best ingredients and they make it just the way I like it,\" she said. The restaurant also catered her 2011 wedding in the building's courtyard.</p><p>For many residents, the security of a private restaurant, which feels like an extension of home, has grown more attractive during the pandemic.</p><p>\"There are still a lot of people who don't feel comfortable going to restaurants,\" said Lauren Witkoff, 62, an executive at Witkoff, the New York-based real-estate development firm founded by her husband, Steven Witkoff. Last year, the couple bought a $5.8-million condo at the Ritz-Carlton Residences in Miami Beach, which has a private restaurant. \"It's nice not to have to deal with traffic and crowds, and not to have to clean up your own mess,\" she said. </p><p>Lauren Witkoff owns a condo at the Ritz-Carlton Residences in Miami Beach.

Because of the pandemic, the opening was delayed until May 2021. Mr. Freedman said residents pay as they go to eat at the building's restaurant, which has no minimum annual fees. Common charges keep about a dozen people employed full-time in the restaurant.</p><p>At Millennium Tower Boston, board member Howard Goldman, 62, said he knows residents are eager to bring the restaurant back online; it's the question he's asked most often by neighbors. \"People aren't happy about it, but we have a pretty valid reason, which is Covid,\" he said. \"We didn't want to take on that risk.\"</p><p>Mr. Goldman said condo fees that would have been used to support the restaurant instead went to other improvements, like adding Peloton bikes in the gym and improving a golf simulator room. The board was also able to add to its reserve fund, he said. The restaurant is set to open with a new operator in the coming weeks, he said, pending the transfer of its liquor license.</p><p>He, too, is anxious for the restaurant to reopen. \"It's a nice amenity to have,\" said Mr. Goldman, who ate there three times a week before Covid, particularly on nights he came home late from work. \"The food was good. You could always get a drink. It's just so convenient.\" </p><p>Takeout from the private restaurant at the Ritz-Carlton Residences in Miami Beach.
