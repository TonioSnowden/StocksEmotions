  "text": "<p>Dear reader,</p> <p>They say a good landing is one you can walk away from and a great landing is one that allows you to re-use the aircraft. I learnt this on a recent gliding course. </p> <p>The instructor had a tendency to grab the dual controls convulsively on the final approach. He told me I'd be a pilot when I could land on the ground instead of trying to fly into it.</p> <p>Businesses that soared on the uplift of the asset bubble are also attempting to minimise damage as they come back to earth with a bump. </p> <p>It will be a recurring theme for the Lex Newsletter. We will publish an abbreviated version of this Fridays-only over the summer break, returning to full, twice-weekly form on August 31. To comment on this or any other aspect of our coverage please email me at <a href=\"mailto:lexfeedback@ft.com\">lexfeedback@ft.com</a>.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500, the Stoxx Europe 600 and the UK's domestically oriented FTSE 250 have rallied since the end of June. This has raised hopes of a tolerably soft landing. Long funds are still left nursing losses.</p> <p>Some of these are at London's <strong>Man Group,</strong> which reported <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ca70f7b-87d9-47a8-8185-e12af7eaed7e\">weak inflows and poor returns</a> from long funds this week. The hedge fund company is best-known for AHL, a trader bot that is good at making money in steadily declining markets. </p> <p>Lex has favoured Man, whose shares have risen 6 per cent year to date. We do not back hedge funds broadly. Too many of them are old wine in new bottles. They have a habit of souring in bear markets which suggests they are mislabelled. </p> <p>On cue, tech-heavy <strong>Tiger Global</strong> has told investors that its flagship fund fell a staggering 50 per cent after fees in the first half of 2022. </p> <p>Lex's hunch is that private equity will weather the current downturn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a34b080c-7f58-4864-8f3a-19bc585a6e56\">better than hedge funds</a>. That was what happened during the financial crisis. Some readers strongly disagreed with our opinion, underlining our own reservations about valuations from the likes of <strong>Blackstone</strong>. </p> <p>Hedge funds invested in quoted securities mark investments to market. Buyout groups come up with their own numbers. These can resist gravitational pressure from stock markets for a while, though not forever.</p> <p><strong>Bitcoin</strong>, which has recently correlated with US stocks — or at least the exuberance of a subset of US investors — has edged up to $23,100. It is down 50 per cent so far this year. <strong>Tesla</strong> has sold most of its $1.5bn holding. </p> <p>We think other tech companies should <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0740146c-17a1-4a3f-9741-15475ef3aa0c\">follow the lead of Elon Musk</a>. Times are tougher. Holding a volatile asset on the balance sheet no longer looks cool. It looks stupid.</p> <p>Meme stocks are bitcoin by other means. Meme traders, like '80s popster Adam Ant, think ridicule is nothing to be scared of. Reassured by more stable market conditions, they have been piling into obscure fintech <strong>AMTD Digital</strong>. This is based in Hong Kong but listed in New York. </p> <p>Trading volumes have been thin. So the solidity of a market cap figure exceeding that of Goldman Sachs is questionable. The only claim to fame of “Asia's GameStop” is an indirect link to property tycoon Li Ka-shing.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a191e0de-38a6-469b-8d91-0a206053a823\">ascent of AMTD</a> will make no sense to investors driven by fundamentals. But the point of a meme stock ramp for traders is to ride the weight of money upwards and get out before a crash. Underlying logic is not needed on the voyage.</p> <p>The prices of big tech companies previously blended decent fundamentals with the same speculative ardour. Much of the latter has been bashed out of them over the past few months. This makes the world a better place. </p> <p>An example is <strong>PayPal</strong>. As a key online payments business it has a nice, maturing franchise. Fierce hedge fund Elliot <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb92324b-37af-4bd5-818e-af72fe943c38\">has taken a stake</a>. But this seems more like an endorsement than a criticism. Hopefully, a sharp drop in the share price will discourage management from investing in further silly side hustles.</p> <p>Lex thinks <strong>Italian bonds</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1bfdba8-47a6-4f98-97c5-f0903fd58d92\">will have a soft landing</a> too. The economic profile of that beautiful country is dreadful. But the European Central Bank has to prop up sovereign bond prices for political reasons. Expect the yield spread over German Bunds to narrow.</p> <h2>Yes, that war, remember?</h2> <p>The war in Ukraine has gone from being a subject of all-consuming interest to the international media to a recurring mid-level item. This is interesting for me to observe for a couple of reasons. First, because Lex is running far fewer notes on the impact of what has become a war of military and financial attrition. The second reason is that I have a family of Ukrainian refugees living in my house.</p> <p>When the six-year-old stood on our back lawn and saw the vapour trails of airliners flying in and out of Gatwick, he thought they came from Russian rockets.</p> <p>So I can understand why people struggle with the idea that the Russian invasion has produced huge, indirect returns for energy multinationals. </p> <p>Bombs are raining down on innocent civilians. And in the business news, Swiss-based mining group <strong>Glencore</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ccb3fe69-b999-44b0-b7ed-17edb5790933\">has doubled half-year earnings</a> and US oil giants <strong>Exxon</strong> and <strong>Chevron</strong> trebled <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bbcfba2-e665-4a93-94b6-82ead8897708\">quarterly profits</a>.</p> <p>UN secretary-general António Guterres recently joined the chorus demanding windfall taxes on the “excessive profits” of the energy sector. He is a politician, after all. But the demand does not make a lot of sense when you consider that not so long ago, bears expected Glencore to go bust and that it paid no dividends for a couple of years. </p> <p>Is the UN planning to bail out Glencore or US shale drillers if that happens again? </p> <p>Thought not.</p> <p>Lex opposes privatisation of gains and socialisation of losses, as epitomised by noughties bankers. The corollary is that socialising gains and privatising losses is unacceptable too.</p> <p>But it is easier to feel happy about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e062fe73-61e1-4817-90cf-7f82f3fe3683\">brisk business for hotel companies</a>, such as <strong>Hilton Worldwide</strong> and <strong>Wyndham Hotels</strong>, than for coal miners and oil drillers bolstered by an energy crisis triggered by a war. </p> <p>If, like this newsletter, you're taking a summer break, I hope you enjoy it. </p> <p><strong>Jonathan Guthrie<br></strong><em>Head of Lex</em></p><p>Source: Jonathan Guthrie in London 2022 'The Lex Newsletter: the prang's the thang' FT.com 5 August.
