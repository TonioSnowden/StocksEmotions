  "text": "<p>Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 slid about 500 points, or 1.5%, as of 2 a.m. Eastern. S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 were down 1.5%, or 68 points, while Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00 slid 1.5%, or more than 200 points.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said on Sunday that he cannot support it â€” potentially handing Biden and Democrats a major political loss. Goldman Sachs downgraded their U.S. growth forecasts for 2022, citing difficulties in getting the spending bill passed.</p><p>Meanwhile, new COVID-19 cases are growing sharply in many parts of the world, fueled by the rapid spread of omicron. Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that he expects record cases of COVID-19 this winter, and urged people to get vaccinated and get boosters.</p><p>Wall Street has a shortened week coming up, with markets closed Friday for the Christmas holiday.</p>",
