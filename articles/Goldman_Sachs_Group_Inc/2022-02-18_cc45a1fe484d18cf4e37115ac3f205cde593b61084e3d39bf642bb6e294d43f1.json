  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Goldman Sachs's Rosy Outlook Falls Shy of '21 Performance  ----  By Charley Grant",
  "text": "<p>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. remains on track to exceed the lofty financial targets it set out two years ago, Chief Executive David Solomon said Thursday, a sign that Wall Street's pandemic boom isn't over yet. </p><p>   Key business lines such as investment banking and trading are still going strong after the bank set revenue and profit records last year, Mr. Solomon said at an investor conference. And while a repeat of 2021 is unlikely, he said, Goldman should continue to deliver shareholder returns at levels unseen in more than a decade. </p><p>   The bank is now targeting a return on equity, a measure of how profitably the bank uses shareholder money, of 14% to 16% within the next three years. Goldman also boosted the long-term outlook for its asset management and consumer banking businesses. </p><p>   Covid-19's effects on supply chains and consumers led businesses to rethink their long-term strategy, which spurred a flurry of mergers and acquisitions. Meanwhile, emergency monetary stimulus from the Federal Reserve resulted in volatile trading activity, and many companies chose to go public after a rapid recovery in capital markets. </p><p>   Those factors allowed Goldman to post results that blew away its 2020 forecast. Return on equity was 23% last year and 11.1% in 2020. The original forecast issued in January 2020 called for Goldman to surpass 13% by the end of 2022. </p><p>   Now, central banks have signaled that easy-money policies to support the economy during the pandemic are coming to an end. Soaring inflation has the Federal Reserve poised to start raising interest rates next month, which could chill a hot market for deals. </p><p>   \"We don't believe last year's ROE is sustainable in any way,\" Mr. Solomon said Thursday at an investor conference. </p><p>   Goldman shares fell 3% on Thursday. </p><p>   The stock has returned 52% since the start of 2020, topping the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index and the S&amp;P 500. But Goldman shares have fallen 9% so far this year, a sign that investors expect operating conditions to eventually revert to pre-pandemic norms. The stock closed at $349.06 on Thursday. </p><p>   Still, Wall Street is expecting a strong year from Goldman, even if pandemic-era returns aren't realistic over the long term. Analysts expect revenue of $48.9 billion and earnings of $40.43 a share for this year, according to FactSet. That is down 18% and 32%, respectively, from 2021, but above pre-pandemic results. </p><p>   \"In a more difficult environment, I expect our bank to do relatively well,\" Mr. Solomon said. </p><p>   Goldman also offered investors an update on its plan to become a bigger presence on Main Street. The bank expects consumer deposits to reach $150 billion by 2024, and consumer loan and card balances to reach $30 billion. At the 2020 investor event, Goldman said it would aim to increase consumer deposits to $125 billion and consumer loan and card balances to $20 billion within five years. </p><p>   Goldman last month said it plans to introduce a checking account this year and unveiled its new credit card with General Motors Co. </p><p>   Goldman announced a $2.2 billion deal to acquire specialty lender GreenSky last fall, which will boost the bank's ability to help customers fund big purchases. Analysts polled by FactSet expect Goldman's consumer banking revenue to reach about $1.8 billion in 2022, which would mark 23% growth from a year earlier. Goldman expects that business to reach $4 billion in revenue by 2024. </p><p></p>",
