  "text": "<p><strong>One quick video to start:</strong> Brexit has eroded the City's position as Europe's top financial hub. The FT's Lex investigates how London's finance sector might reinvent itself in the face of adversity. Watch it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/ee442b39-74e6-4d6b-977f-2a628eb8cbdd\">here</a>.</p> <h2>The Buffett banker staking his claim in the PR world</h2> <p><strong>Sir Alan Parker</strong> has no shortage of influential friends. Both <strong>David Cameron</strong> and <strong>Gordon Brown </strong>attended the PR mogul's second wedding in 2007. The former stayed at Parker's seven-bedroom Holland Park townhouse when he resigned abruptly as prime minister following the Brexit vote five years ago this month.</p> <p>Now Parker, founder and chair of<strong> Brunswick Group</strong>, the PR and lobbying group with tentacles in financial and political centres from Washington and London to Brussels and Hong Kong, has acquired another powerful ally.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Byron Trott</strong>, a former <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> dealmaker and banker to <strong>Warren Buffett</strong>, is taking a minority stake in Brunswick, valuing the group at £500m, the FT's Michael O'Dwyer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37e84da2-66af-49af-82d3-c438f41eb0b2\">reports</a>.</p> <p>Trott's Chicago-based merchant banking outfit <strong>BDT Capital Partners </strong>will invest more than £50m through a $9.1bn fund raised from its wealthy clients last year, people involved in the deal said.&#xa0;</p> <p>BDT, which invests over a longer time horizon than private equity firms, will take a seat on the board of<strong> Brunswick Group Partnership</strong>, the new UK company that will replace its existing limited liability partnership.&#xa0;</p> <p>Aside from the cash, Brunswick will hope to gain access to Trott's insights, not least in the US, where it has made headway with hires such as former<strong> World Bank </strong>president and <strong>Robinhood </strong>board member <strong>Robert Zoellick</strong> (who wrote an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c7d2d28-36b4-4bd5-a963-db3c776c5da2\">op-ed</a> for the FT earlier this year).</p> <p>The restructuring is the latest in a series of mergers and external investments in PR firms as they try to establish corporate structures that will enable them to outlast their founders.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ef2e618-8944-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2\">paid more than $350m</a> for a majority stake in Brunswick's rival <strong>Teneo</strong> in 2019 and <strong>Finsbury,</strong> <strong>The</strong> <strong>Glover Park Group</strong> and <strong>Hering Schuppener</strong> merged last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Parker has been known to joke privately that he forgot to get paid for the 40 per cent stake he handed to Brunswick's partners as part of its last restructuring in 2012. That won't be true this time round.</p> <p>The PR mogul is set to bag £70m of a £140m cash distribution to Brunswick's 200 partners. Brunswick's more junior spinners will also enjoy a bumper payday, sharing an £18m pool.&#xa0;</p> <p>Parker, who will still own almost half of the business, insisted he wouldn't be running off into the sunset after receiving his windfall. Explaining the deal in a note to staff, he said: “I am as energised as ever.”</p> <h2>Toshiba's boardroom drama takes another explosive turn</h2> <p>With each shocking new development in the <strong>Toshiba</strong> saga (now running into its sixth year), the world gets a fresh — and often quite unsettling — glimpse into one of the most fascinating engine rooms of corporate Japan.&#xa0;</p> <p>The latest peek, which began on June 10 with the publication of a 147-page independent <a href=\"https://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/ir/en/news/20210610_1.pdf\">report</a> into Toshiba's 2020 annual shareholder meeting, is perhaps the most revealing: a forensic, legalistic mapping of interactions between the company and Japan's government as the two colluded to suppress <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2b3c1e7-699e-4c8c-800b-1b26498a7adb\">campaigns</a> by shareholder activists.</p> <p>The FT's Leo Lewis and Kana Inagaki have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/825f549f-2a56-4bab-bf7f-157649eeb45d\">picked apart</a> the implications of this extraordinary document, and the effect it is likely to have both on Toshiba and the once almighty <strong>Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry </strong>(Meti).</p> <p>The report concludes that the company's 2020 AGM was conducted unfairly and involved what investors describe as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/827f9a26-0248-4c42-b635-74869d9e2984\">“dark arts” campaign</a>.</p> <p>There's a real possibility that for more pessimistic investors, the incident could be interpreted as proof that no matter how promising things look in terms of fearless reform and taboo-busting, Japan will eventually default to a protectionist, change-resistant crouch.</p> <p>But this is a fast-moving story, and the landscape is primed for another big shift. On Friday, Toshiba is holding its annual general meeting — an event that was previously going to be fairly tame, but could now produce a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef743f3b-ea27-4afe-ba61-79365e2a808c\">mass investor revolt</a> that ousts chair <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3bc429b6-8bb5-41f3-a462-55b6f852c4c3\"><strong>Osamu Nagayama</strong></a>, and potentially the rest of the board.&#xa0;</p> <p>If that happens, it will arguably rank as Japan's biggest powerplay by activist investors and, conceivably, a template with which others may take on the cash-hoarding, cross-shareholding and other shareholder unfriendly practices of corporate Japan.</p> <p>At the same time, the same business-government establishment whose cosy collusion was laid bare in the report seems unlikely to take all this lying down: there are signs that a backlash is coming and, chillingly, could take the form of calls from conservative politicians to create greater artificial protections for listed Japanese companies.</p> <p>The report reveals the extent to which Toshiba and Meti appeared to have believed that the highly contentious <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd648a8c-1a8a-11ea-9186-7348c2f183af\">2019 revision</a> to the <strong>Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act</strong> granted an extra layer of protection against <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a36f3b0-4419-11ea-a43a-c4b328d9061c\">foreign activists</a>.</p> <p>The revision itself, which the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bef5d398-0d0e-11ea-bb52-34c8d9dc6d84\">covered in detail</a> at the time, was clearly a source of behind-the-scenes friction between Meti, Japan's <strong>finance ministry</strong> and the country's <strong>Financial Services Agency</strong>.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Friday's AGM could produce a short-term triumph for a few activists, but the blowback against activism may follow with surprising speed.</p> <h2>Dodging activist jabs, GSK's chief executive presses on</h2> <p>When one of the world's most feared activists shows up at your door, you answer.</p> <p>For <strong>Emma Walmsley</strong>, the chief executive of underperforming UK drugmaker <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> since 2017, the pressure is on to placate her unexpected guests.</p> <p>That's because when hedge fund <strong>Elliott Management </strong>took a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1d64eff-7cfb-4f73-9a48-45857640f9a9\">multibillion-pound stake</a> in the company this year, one of its biggest gripes was that Walmsley <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8318b00-6102-4d7c-8b6e-92ea5ec2e11f\">may not be the best fit</a> for the job.</p> <p>The firm's concerns over her lack of a scientific background have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8318b00-6102-4d7c-8b6e-92ea5ec2e11f\">won some support</a> from fellow investors as GSK shares have fallen 6 per cent in the past year.</p> <p>But in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b36d9f8e-c05d-4efe-9352-43a2fc5208f8#\">interview</a> with the FT's Hannah Kuchler, Walmsley said she refuses to be distracted by questions about her leadership as she embarks on an ambitious plan to reach £33bn in sales by 2031.</p> <p>First in line is the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2c647a2-caf9-431d-80c6-8b1d6a7a7c13\">spin-off</a> of GSK's consumer health business due to be completed next year. Walmsley called it a “very, very shareholder-friendly” deal that would help fuel investment in developing new medicines.</p> <p>The consumer healthcare business, which owns brands such as Centrum vitamins and Sensodyne toothpaste, is a joint venture with <strong>Pfizer</strong>. The plan is to demerge at least four-fifths of GSK's 68 per cent stake in a listing on the London Stock Exchange next year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Money gleaned from the deal will help fund its dealmaking strategy, which includes rebuilding its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8edb8fb-4ab6-49ed-8c81-326c862d75ec\">oncology</a> business after former chief executive <strong>Sir Andrew Witty</strong> sold its products in the area to<strong> Novartis </strong>in 2015.&#xa0;</p> <p>Yet as the split looms, shareholders fear it won't be enough to reverse GSK's fortunes.&#xa0;</p> <p>And as Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a02fb3e-b57b-41ff-9dd3-49c0b87fff44\">highlights</a>, by clinging on to a fifth of its stake in the business, it means GSK is giving up money from the sale that could be earmarked for the dealmaking and R&amp;D goals Elliott and other shareholders are keen to see.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the plan will be enough to muffle calls for Walmsley's resignation.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Warren Buffett </strong>is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c64a1a44-14ee-4597-9fe2-72083074e182\">stepping down</a> from his role as a trustee of the <strong>Gates Foundation</strong>, adding to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27c44ac3-e03b-4c65-b555-f7917ee2f584\">uncertainty</a> facing the world's largest private philanthropy organisation after the divorce of its co-chairs <strong>Bill</strong> and<strong> Melinda Gates</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Ervin Tu</strong>, a managing partner at<strong> SoftBank</strong>'s Vision Fund, is joining <strong>Naspers</strong>-owned <strong>Prosus</strong> as group chief of investments, strategy and M&amp;A.
