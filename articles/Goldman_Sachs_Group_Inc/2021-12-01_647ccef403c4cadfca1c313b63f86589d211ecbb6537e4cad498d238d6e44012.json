Technical meetings were slated for Wednesday, followed by a meeting of OPEC+ ministers on Thursday.</p><p>Some believe worries about how the variant will affect travel and activity could pressure OPEC+ to pause monthly increases in oil production that would have lifted output by another 400,000 barrels a day in January.</p><p>“The last thing OPEC would want to do is add more fuel — for the lack of a better word – to the fire. They are widely expected to pause plans for additional output increases starting from January,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets, in a note.</p><p>See:OPEC+ at a crossroads as oil prices post worst monthly drop since the pandemic began</p><p>“Opportunistic bulls are undoubtedly taking advantage of the downbeat prices, while bearish oil speculators wouldn't want to run the risk of seeing another price spike and are buying back their presumably profitable short positions, thus fueling the kickback rally even more,” he said.</p><p>Along with other global assets, the commodity has been on a roller coaster since Friday's announcement of the new omicron variant of coronavirus by South African scientists.
