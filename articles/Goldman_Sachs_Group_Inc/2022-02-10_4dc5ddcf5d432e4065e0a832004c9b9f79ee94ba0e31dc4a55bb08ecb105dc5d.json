  "text": "<p>Welcome back to Energy Source.</p> <p>Britain's BP this week became the latest supermajor to report a banner set of earnings. On Tuesday the company unveiled its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/999f719f-7561-4dfa-adb5-def8e58ea35d\">highest annual profits</a> since 2013.</p> <p>That prompted fresh calls for a windfall tax on energy companies reaping the rewards of high oil and gas prices. But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/999f719f-7561-4dfa-adb5-def8e58ea35d\">BP boss Bernard Looney hit back</a>, insisting such a move would eat into funds earmarked for low-carbon projects. “I don't think a windfall tax is going to incentivise people to invest in the thing that we need right now,” he told the Financial Times.</p> <p>Another fossil fuel group expected to post solid earnings is Peabody, the world's biggest coal producer, which reports this morning. The coal industry has benefited from a resurgence in demand despite global efforts to shift away from the dirtiest energy source. Check out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com\">ft.com</a> for details. </p> <p>On to today's newsletter: US petrol prices have surged to fresh highs in recent weeks — adding to Joe Biden's inflationary woes. But after unleashing strategic reserves on to the market in November, the president's further options to tame prices are limited. Justin Jacobs reports on the (lack of) levers at the administration's disposal.</p> <p>And we round up the latest on the situation in Ukraine, with Japan pledging to divert supplies of liquefied natural gas to Europe to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71143b14-4d82-498e-8f4c-8fefca49a91c\">ease the continent's fears</a> of an energy crisis. </p> <p>Data Drill charts the potential impact of Biden's push for a raft of new clean energy tax credits, which a new report finds would be one of the most cost-effective ways to slash US emissions. </p> <p>As ever, thanks for reading.</p> <h1>High fuel prices are back on Biden's agenda</h1> <p>Prices at the pump rose to fresh seven-year highs this week, which has piled pressure on Joe Biden to take action again on a problem he has little control over. </p> <p>Biden administration officials have insisted in recent days that “all options are on the table” to tackle rising petrol prices. But none of those options are great. </p> <p>The national average price at the pump hit $3.46 per gallon yesterday, the highest since 2014, said the American Automobile Association (AAA), which tracks stations across the country. </p> <p>Those prices are likely to rise higher in the coming weeks as demand continues its robust recovery and pump prices catch up with the recent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99f5eb03-0853-46c1-a95c-158b0e1b69d6#post-958fee8a-2a24-406f-b80d-039c78eb2f68\">rally in crude markets</a>.</p> <p>So, what are we likely to hear from the administration on fuel prices in the coming weeks?</p> <h2>1. Strategic petroleum reserve chatter</h2> <p>Expect to start hearing more about the strategic petroleum reserve again. In November, the administration sought to quell a surge in prices by authorising the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a682a7c8-66d3-466a-948c-451c56ead1ed\">release of 50mn barrels</a> out of the strategic stockpile.</p> <p>That was followed by a drop in prices, temporarily. US crude prices fell nearly 25 per cent from a high of around $85 a barrel in early November, to around $65 a barrel a couple of weeks later. But as analysts warned, the effect was shortlived and prices have since surpassed levels that triggered the release.</p> <p>A double-dip into America's strategic stockpile to deliberately drive down prices would be unprecedented. </p> <p>Yet this week the White House's spokesperson Jen Psaki said there were “ongoing” talks with oil-consuming countries about additional efforts to pump crude from strategic stocks on to the market. </p> <p>The administration is also likely to continue pressuring producers in the Opec+ alliance as well as those at home to ramp up output. </p> <blockquote>  <p>“Nobody should hold back supply at the expense of the American consumer, particularly as the recovery from the pandemic continues, and oil producers around the world have the capacity to produce at levels that match demand and reduce the high prices,” Psaki said on Tuesday.</p> </blockquote> <h2>2. Pleas to Opec+</h2> <p>As prices rise, expect calls from the White House, and other capitals, to grow louder for Opec+ to accelerate its planned monthly production increases. </p> <p>Yesterday, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/09/readout-of-president-joseph-r-biden-jr-s-call-with-king-salman-bin-abdulaziz-al-saud-of-saudi-arabia/\">the White House said</a> that President Biden spoke with Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz about “ensuring the stability of global energy supplies.” It was just the second official call with the Saudi leader. The Saudis appeared non-committal, saying in their <a href=\"https://www.spa.gov.sa/viewfullstory.php?lang=en&amp;newsid=2328223#2328223\">own statement on the call</a> that the king had highlighted the “importance of maintaining” the OPEC+ agreement.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a523cae7-88e6-4a28-9c16-976224bc4bbc\">As Derek wrote here at ES last week</a>, even if the Saudis and others in the group heeded such calls, its ability to quickly start pumping more is in severe doubt. The group's supply is trailing its own targets and the market is increasingly doubtful that it can get anywhere close to its self-proclaimed capacity — at least anytime soon. </p> <h2>3. A push for higher domestic oil output </h2> <p>On the home front? Ninety dollar oil is undoubtedly stirring the shale patch. The Energy Information Administration now expects US oil output to grow by around 800,000 barrels a day from the start of the year to the end of the year, more than it expected just a month ago. </p> <p>But there are no signs that US shale producers are going to pick up the pace of drilling at the White House's behest, especially with Wall Street still pressuring them to keep a lid on growth.</p> <h2>4. Efforts to revive the Iran deal </h2> <p>Perhaps the biggest impact the White House could have in oil markets would be to strike a deal with Iran to return to the Obama-era nuclear agreement, which would likely see sanctions on Iran's oil sector ease. Those negotiations appear to be coming into a critical phase.</p> <p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs say a deal would free up around 1mn b/d of exports currently held in check by the sanctions. Although they cast doubt that a deal could be done.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“While the incentives to strike a deal have increased on the US front, with oil prices reaching new cycle highs, we remain cautious that a deal can be achieved soon,” they argued.</p> </blockquote> <p>Even if a new agreement is reached, Goldman Sachs reckons a deal announcement would only knock around $4 off of the oil prices and would not derail the market's bull run. In other words, not exactly the oil market cure all it might hope. (<em>Justin Jacobs)</em></p> <h1>Japan comes to Europe's aid with liquefied natural gas</h1> <p>Japan is diverting supplies of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe, in the latest effort to calm fears of an energy crisis on the continent should Russia invade Ukraine. </p> <p>The move, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71143b14-4d82-498e-8f4c-8fefca49a91c\">reported by our colleagues in Tokyo</a>, is aimed at showing solidarity among Western countries in the face of potential Russian disruption to gas flows. </p> <p>Rahm Emanuel, the US ambassador to Japan, said the pledge showed how closely Washington and Tokyo were working “with like-minded partners to deter Russian aggression against Ukraine, and uphold our shared values”. </p> <p>Ships carrying at least 70,000 tonnes of LNG are already on their way to Europe. Tokyo plans to send more in March and April. The decision is significant in that Japan is a big consumer of gas and was until last year the world's biggest importer. </p> <p>The shipment diversions come in the wake of a continued diplomatic scramble to head off the prospect of an invasion of Ukraine. </p> <p>Following talks in Moscow earlier this week, French president Emmanuel Macron said his Russian opposite number Vladimir Putin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16cd11e8-b800-4846-b977-c1349da38759\">had assured him</a> there would be no “deterioration or escalation” of the crisis.</p> <p>Britain's foreign secretary Liz Truss meets her Russian counterpart later today. British diplomats told the FT that London would be taking <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/666ba17a-3fa3-415d-ae76-dc7a860467ac\">a tougher approach</a> than Paris, emphasising the “severe costs” of any invasion.</p> <p>But despite the various efforts to defuse the situation, US officials <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36a4a1d8-fe4b-4717-bbf5-9decf4bd28ae\">warned last night</a> that Russia has continued to ramp up its military activity around the Ukrainian border. <em>(Myles McCormick)</em></p> <h1>Data Drill</h1> <p>Clean electricity tax credits are one of the least expensive ways to reduce emissions, says a <a href=\"https://epic.uchicago.edu/area-of-focus/assessing-the-costs-and-benefits-of-clean-electricity-tax-credits/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosgenerate&amp;stream=top\">new report</a> from Rhodium Group and the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. </p> <p>The report found that the benefits of the clean energy tax credits in the Build Back Better legislation, which is currently stalled in the US Senate, would exceed costs by as much as $1.5tn. </p> <p>Compared with existing climate policies, BBB's tax incentives are less expensive and cover the entire electricity sector while existing policies only cover small parts of the economy. They would reduce carbon emissions at a cost of $33-$50 per ton, according to the report. </p> <p>The legislation could slash power sector emissions by 13-22 per cent by 2050.
