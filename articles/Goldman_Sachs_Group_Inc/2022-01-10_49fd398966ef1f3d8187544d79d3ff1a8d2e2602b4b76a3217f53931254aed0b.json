Cheering residents in the surrounding block leaned out of their doors and windows to sing along. When restrictions eased, each night we danced outside The Mansion — six feet apart.</p> <p>Today, that loudspeaker is gone and the restaurant is fully open, with indoor dining and an outdoor space. But The Mansion remains one of the happiest spots in my neighbourhood: at dawn, it is filled with NYPD officers coming off their night shift, sitting next to young mothers with babies who have woken early; at lunch it bustles with pensioners sipping soup and swapping gossip; in the early evening, there are harried professionals who do not want to cook at home; and late at night there are hordes of teenagers eating chicken nuggets and drinking milkshakes. Is the food tasty? Not particularly. But the stodgy pancakes, fries, bagels, burgers and spinach pie scream “I love New York — for better or worse!” It makes my soul sing, even without the music.

The answer is Dulwich Park, just five minutes' walk from my front door. When we first came here 37 years ago, we used to take our two young sons and then our daughter to the park. Nowadays, it is where we go with their children.</p> <p>The park is where I enjoy brisk walks and quiet reflection. It is where I marvel at the blooming rhododendrons and azaleas of the American Garden in spring. This legacy of the Victorians opened in 1890. Restored to its original layout, it offers a <a href=\"https://www.colicci.co.uk/locations/dulwich-clock-cafe\">café</a>, a pond full of waterfowl, running tracks, football pitches, tennis courts, cricket nets and even a bowling green. The park also used to have a metal sculpture by Barbara Hepworth. Alas, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16266378\">vandals cut it from its plinth in 2011</a>, presumably for its value as scrap.</p> <p>The Victorians knew that people need green space. Dulwich Park has long been my place of peace, especially so in the months of lockdowns.

But according to my calendar, it is the place to which we went the most during the pandemic, not least because it is a few blocks from where we live. Given pandemic restaurant inflation, its hitherto bubble prices now seem almost reasonable. Moreover, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump have left town, so we no longer have to curse fate for coinciding with their Secret Service entourage. Most of all, though, Cafe Milano has a nice menu and is never dull. It almost feels as though you are in London or New York.

The foothills of the Carpathians, where everyone should go to dream, and for a glimpse of the bucolic landscape of yesteryear? That secretive wine bar, unknown to FT colleagues, near St Paul's? </p> <p>But after 20 uninterrupted months in the UK — and this after I assumed on reaching adulthood I would be permanently peripatetic — I face no agonising: for me it is the stretch of the Thames Path that winds east and west for a mile or so from the forlorn spans of <a href=\"https://www.lbhf.gov.uk/transport-and-roads/hammersmith-bridge-all-you-need-know-and-latest-updates\">Hammersmith Bridge</a>.

Like in all the best Spanish squares, there's a playground in the middle, so parents are de-stressing while the kids go wild. Handsome bourgeois apartments overlook us. The adjoining streets are pedestrianised, so it's as quiet as central Madrid gets. The three-course lunchtime fixed menu costs a ludicrous €13 or so.

Few of them, though, could be classified as a major cultural event. The exception was the inauguration of the Neue Nationalgalerie, which opened its doors last August after a six-year, €140m renovation.</p> <p>It's housed in one of Berlin's most spectacular buildings — a temple-like construction by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, one of the pioneers of modernism.

Warm and welcoming, it's a classic old boozer with a modern menu: short, seasonal and gratifying, with taps to please most tastes. </p> <p>The Cleveland Arms is a place of real community in our sprawling metropolis, helmed until recently by an exuberant Italian named Toni, who was adored by the pub's patrons, their progeny and pups. If the option were available, I'd be tempted to seek a government contract for Toni. He made every visit (and ours are frequent) memorable. We are spoiled with good pubs in this corner of west London — but this one is something special.

In those 1.3 square miles, I took countless evening walks around the <a href=\"https://www.centralparknyc.org/locations/harlem-meer\">Harlem Meer</a> after long work days, picnicked on <a href=\"https://www.centralparknyc.org/locations/sheep-meadow\">Sheep Meadow</a> and brunched at <a href=\"https://www.tavernonthegreen.com/\">Tavern on the Green</a> with friends, <a href=\"https://www.centralpark.com/things-to-do/sports/ice-skating/\">ice-skated</a> with friends to celebrate my birthday, watched a Shakespeare play in the <a href=\"https://www.centralparknyc.org/locations/delacorte-theater\">open-air theatre</a> and raced rowboats rented from <a href=\"https://thecentralparkboathouse.com/\">The Loeb Boathouse</a>.

This is a country that&#xa0;values quality loaves, with makers here required to become <a href=\"https://breadvillage.com/blogs/breadmeister-talk/why-german-bakers-are-the-best-in-the-world\">masters in&#xa0;the art of&#xa0;breadmaking</a> before opening their own premises.

Baking is on site, and products are as fresh as one might imagine. Its attractions survive the winter months intact. Indeed, while I've been working from home, it has become a ritual to go there at the end of my daily walks and pick up a <em>Rosinenbrötchen</em> (teacake) and a slice of their delicious quiche, and forget for a minute or two about the pandemic raging here and elsewhere.

Usually I know it's coming. It's most exciting when I don't. I call it “the great reveal”: a stop or two on the subway, where the train emerges from underground to a spectacular view. I picture the great reveal in snapshots: standing at the door on a crisp sunny day, studying the longview of Brooklyn to the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Verrazzano-Narrows+Bridge/@40.6079748,-74.056493,15.06z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c24f9d7467b16d:0x8a96b2e377bdf33f!8m2!3d40.6066162!4d-74.0446602\">Verrazzano Bridge</a>. Lounging at midnight in a near-empty car, feet on the seat, transfixed by the lights of Manhattan for the billionth time. A glance up from my phone to catch the sun setting over a tiny Statue of Liberty that I could pick up and put in my hand. It happens on the Q train as it crosses the Manhattan Bridge, or the 7 in multiple spots in Queens. But my local great reveal is on the F train in Brooklyn. The train sets free at a height and hugs a curve, bending us down into the city and revolving it, like a plane or a planet. New York from that arc, between <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Carroll+St,+Brooklyn,+NY,+USA/4th+Ave+%26+9th+St,+Brooklyn,+NY+11215,+USA/@40.6741438,-73.9919455,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25a55e351023b:0x298a11630c6dd318!2m2!1d-73.9882633!2d40.6778413!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c25afc75d13ba7:0x551e5cc4d88145eb!2m2!1d-73.9887644!2d40.6704097!3e2\">Fourth Avenue &amp; Ninth Street and Carroll</a> Street, feels somehow grand and also contained, unknowable and also entirely mine.

Scattered across the capital, green spaces like this are welcome gaps in the sprawl — but Grovelands is lovelier than most. It has tree-lined paths, which change colour with the seasons. There's a swan-inhabited lake, with a small opening at which delighted toddlers can be seen feeding the ducks. There's a wood that provides shelter from noisy traffic. There's even a pitch-and-putt golf course, which you can watch with amusement as locals hack their way around. The pandemic has transformed me into one of the joggers around the park, a place in which to unwind for half an hour before, inevitably, heading back in front of a screen.

One of my favourite places to seek peace and perspective is the Musée de l'Orangerie in the Tuileries, just off the Place de la Concorde. My go-to spot is the pair of oval-shaped galleries purpose-built to hold Claude Monet's <a href=\"https://www.musee-orangerie.fr/en/node/197502\"><em>Les Nymphéas</em></a> murals. </p> <p>Depicting the pond and gardens at his home in Giverny at different times of day, the paintings are typical of the Impressionist — saturated with colour, dreamy, and evocative. The curved walls of the galleries cradle both the murals and the observer, creating a calm, timeless vibe. Yes, we have all seen Monet's work splashed on postcards and museum swag a million times but, for me, seeing it here never gets old.

Conceived at the end of the 18th century by Archduke Ferdinand Habsburg, the Giardini Indro Montanelli in the central Palestro district was the first public park in the city. It remains one of its few green lungs and is probably the most intimate. I have enjoyed long walks in this 172,000 sq m park; I often sit at the café by one of the little artificial lakes, and I take my eldest daughter to the playground by the Via Manin gate almost every weekend. </p> <p>But when I'm working at home, what I enjoy the most are my sporadic midday escapes here: I file stories, speak to sources and transcribe interviews from a quiet bench. Incidentally, the park was renamed in 2002 after the famed Italian journalist Indro Montanelli, who spent a lot of time here. As a journalist, I completely understand why, out of all the history-filled spots this bustling city has to offer, these Palestro gardens were his favourite.
