  "title": "Oil prices bounce as traders assess China crude release, Gulf of Mexico outages",
  "text": "<p>On Thursday crude tumbled in a choppy trading session, with weakness coming after reports said China plans a release from its crude-oil reserve, in a move to ease commodity price inflation. But analysts have played down the implications of the move, arguing that the move likely refers to releases that already took place this summer.</p><p>The move “is a red herring and is likely referring to a release made earlier this summer,” said Michael Tran, commodity analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a note. “The timing of today's headline is bizarre and can only be interpreted as the Chinese government's way of trying to talk down the market.”</p><p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs, in a note late Thursday, said the move was a reflection of a “fast-tightening oil market” and that the added supply had already been factored into the market.</p><p>The release “is consistent with satellite data inventory tracking, and hence already in our (and consensus) balances,” they wrote.</p><p>Also, “this is conceptually not new crude to the market as the government-designated crude reserves are effectively indistinguishable from Chinese SOE (state-owned enterprise) refiners, as can be seen with the high co-movement of approximated government and commercial satellite inventories. This stands in contrast to U.S. SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve) crude inventories which are significant and assumed to be off the market,” they said.</p><p>Meanwhile, crude output in the Gulf of Mexico remains curtailed following Hurricane Ida, which made landfall on the Louisiana Gulf Coast on Aug. 29. The Bureau of Safety and Economic Enforcement late Thursday estimated that 76.48% of oil production and more than 77% of natural-gas production in the Gulf remains shut in.</p><p>“Total crude oil production losses as a result of Hurricane Ida now amount&#xa0;to a little over 22 million barrels, and with output still struggling to recover, this will grow,” wrote Warren Patterson, head of commodities strategy at ING, in a note.</p><p>News reports Thursday said the Royal Dutch Shell RDS.ARDS.Bcanceled export cargoes as a result of hurricane-related damage to offshore production facilities.</p>",
