  "title": "March 2020: How the Fed Averted Economic Disaster; As markets plunged, Jerome Powell and his colleagues vastly expanded the reach of the central bank, with implications that will be felt for years to come",
  "text": "<p>Over the week of March 16, markets experienced an enormous shock to what investors refer to as liquidity, a catchall term for the cost of quickly converting an asset into cash.</p><p>The Fed had tried to get ahead of liquidity problems that Sunday, March 15, when Mr. Powell led his colleagues to slash interest rates to zero at a second emergency meeting in as many weeks. They were offering nearly unlimited cheap debt to keep the wheels of finance turning, and when that didn't help, the Fed began purchasing massive quantities of government debt outright.</p><p>The next morning, at 6:56 a.m., Mr. Powell dashed off an email to one of his top lieutenants, Vice Chairman Richard Clarida: \"Focus turns 100% now to liquidity, where we may have a lot to do!\"</p><p>But none of the Fed's actions were having their intended effect. Investors dumped whatever they could, including ostensibly \"risk-free\" U.S. Treasury securities. As a global dash for dollars unfolded, Treasurys were no longer serving as the market's traditional shock absorbers, amplifying extreme turmoil on Wall Street.</p><p>\"Hell is coming,\" said billionaire investor Bill Ackman, calling into CNBC at midday on March 18 during an emotional, 28-minute live interview. He called for a 30-day shutdown of the economy. \"We need to shut it down. Shut it down now,\" he said.</p><p>The Dow tumbled as Mr. Ackman spoke, dropping as much as 2,000 points and triggering a marketwide 15-minute trading halt shortly before 1 p.m., one of several that month. By week's end, the Dow had plunged more than 10,000 points since mid-February as investors struggled to get their arms around what a halt to global commerce would mean for businesses that would soon have no revenue.</p><p>Daleep Singh, the markets desk chief at the New York Fed, was inundated with messages from contacts urging a shutdown to trading.</p><p>\"It was sheer, unadulterated panic, of a magnitude that was far worse than in 2008 and 2009. Far worse,\" said Mr. Singh, who had spent the 2008 crisis on the interest-rate desk at the Goldman Sachs trading floor in London. The idea of shutting down markets was especially discouraging: \"It was a profoundly un-American thing to contemplate, to just shut everything down, and almost fatalistic—that we're not going to get out of this.\"</p><p>Today, nearly two years later, most agree that the Fed's actions helped to save the economy from going into a pandemic-induced tailspin. The question now is what will be the long-term costs and implications of that emergency activism—for the Fed, the financial markets and the wider economy.</p><p>\"My thought was—I remember this very clearly—'O.K. We have a four-or-five-day chance to really get our act together and get ahead of this. We're gonna try to get ahead of this,'\" Mr. Powell recalled later. \"And we were going to do that by just announcing a ton of stuff on Monday morning.\"</p><p>It worked. The Fed's pledges to backstop an array of lending, announced on Monday, March 23, would unleash a torrent of private borrowing based on the mere promise of central bank action—together with a massive assist by Congress, which authorized hundreds of billions of dollars that would cover any losses.</p><p>No company illustrated the speed with which the Fed's announcement had buoyed investors better than Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise-line operator. Its business had collapsed as Covid halted cruises world-wide. Within days of the Fed's announcement, Carnival was able to borrow nearly $6 billion from large institutional investors.</p><p>News of the financial salvation ricocheted through the (virtual) corner offices of American corporations, across (virtual) trading floors on Wall Street and even along the actual corridors of the West Wing. If the hardest-hit companies like Carnival, with its fleet of 104 ships docked indefinitely, could raise money in capital markets, who couldn't?</p><p>Mr. Powell unveiled his philosophy during a webinar on April 9, where he shed an earlier reluctance to express an opinion about government spending policies, which are set by elected officials and not the Fed. He spoke in unusually moral terms. \"All of us are affected,\" he said. \"But the burdens are falling most heavily on those least able to carry them…. They didn't cause this. Their business isn't closed because of anything they did wrong. This is what the great fiscal power of the United States is for—to protect these people as best we can from the hardships they are facing.\"</p><p>They were extraordinary words from a Fed chair who during earlier, hot-button policy debates said the central bank needed to \"stay in its lane\" and avoid providing specific advice.</p><p>Earlier that day, the Fed had announced its most novel lending programs yet, which were made possible after Congress included more than $450 billion as capital to cover losses on Fed loans to businesses, cities and states.</p><p>To avoid a widening rift between the market haves (who had been given access to Fed backstops) and the market have-nots (who had been left out because their debt was deemed too risky), Mr. Powell had supported a decision to extend the Fed's lending to include companies that were being downgraded to \"junk\" status in the days after it agreed to backstop their bonds.</p><p>Most controversially, Mr. Powell recommended that the Fed purchase investment vehicles known as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that invest in junk debt. He and his colleagues feared that these \"high-yield\" bonds might buckle, creating a wave of bankruptcies that would cause long-term scarring in the economy. Given the speed with which markets had cracked up in March, Mr. Powell decided that it was better to err on the side of doing too much than not doing enough.</p><p>In a letter circulated to investors, Paul Singer, who runs the hedge-fund firm Elliott Management, warned that the Fed was sowing the seeds of a bigger crisis by absolving markets of any discipline. \"Sadly, when people (including those who should know better) do something stupid and reckless and are not punished,\" he wrote, \"it is human nature that, far from thinking that they were lucky to have gotten away with something, they are encouraged to keep doing the stupid thing.\"</p><p>Reservations about Mr. Powell's make-people-whole mantra weren't limited to the free-market libertarian set. The breathtaking speed with which the Fed moved and with which Wall Street rallied after the Fed's announcements infuriated Dennis Kelleher, a former corporate lawyer and high-ranking Senate aide who runs Better Markets, an advocacy group lobbying for tighter financial regulations.</p><p>\"Literally, not only has no one in finance lost money, but they've all made more money than they could have dreamed,\" said Mr. Kelleher. \"It just can't be the case that the only thing the Fed can do is open the fire hydrants wide for everybody. This is a ridiculous discussion no matter how heartfelt Powell is about 'we can't pick winners and losers'—to which my answer is, 'So instead you just make them all winners?'\"</p><p>Mr. Powell later defended his decision to purchase ETFs that had invested in junk debt. \"We wanted to find a surgical way to get in and support that market because it's a huge market, and it's a lot of people's jobs… What were we supposed to do? Just let them die and lose all those jobs?\" he said. \"If that's the biggest mistake we made, stipulating it as a mistake, I'm fine with that. It wasn't time to be making finely crafted judgments,\" Mr. Powell said. He hesitated for a moment before concluding. \"Do I regret it? I don't—not really.\"</p><p>Mr. Powell and his colleagues waged war against the pandemic shock with their eyes focused on the lessons of the 2008 financial crisis. He later conceded that during the darkest weeks of the crisis, the Fed talked about a \"mini-Depression scenario,\" one in which the virus kept society closed indefinitely.</p><p>\"We didn't know there was a vaccine coming. The pandemic is just raging. And we don't have a plan,\" said Mr. Powell. \"Nobody in the world has a plan. And in hindsight, the worry was, 'What if we can't really fully open the economy for a long time because the pandemic is just out there killing people?'\"</p><p>Mr. Powell never saw this as a particularly likely outcome, \"but it was around the edges of the conversation, and we were very eager to do everything we could to avoid that outcome,\" he said later.</p><p>The Fed's initial response in 2020 received mostly high marks—a notable contrast with the populist ire that greeted Wall Street bailouts following the 2008 financial crisis. North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, gave Mr. Powell an \"A-plus for 2020,\" he said. \"On a one-to-10 scale? It was an 11. He gets the highest, highest marks, and deserves them. The Fed as an institution deserves them.\"</p><p>The pandemic was the most severe disruption of the U.S. economy since the Great Depression. Economists, financial-market professionals and historians are only beginning to wrestle with the implications of the aggressive response by fiscal and monetary policy makers.</p><p>Altogether, Congress approved nearly $5.9 trillion in spending in 2020 and 2021. Adjusted for inflation, that compares with approximately $1.8 trillion in 2008 and 2009.</p><p>By late 2021, it was clear that many private-sector forecasters and economists at the Fed had misjudged both the speed of the recovery and the ways in which the crisis had upset the economy's equilibrium. Washington soon faced a different problem. Disoriented supply chains and strong demand—boosted by government stimulus—had produced inflation running above 7%.</p><p>The Fed's highly improvised response to the pandemic also revealed long-term problems and new precedents that could make addressing future crises more challenging.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How would you rate Fed chief Jerome Powell's response to the pandemic economy? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In the first place, because the pandemic shock was akin to a natural disaster, it allowed Mr. Powell and the Fed to sidestep concerns about moral hazard—that is, the possibility that their policies would encourage people to take greater risks knowing that they were protected against larger losses. If a future crisis is caused instead by greed or carelessness, the Fed would have to take such concerns more seriously.</p><p>Still, in 2020, there was no risk-free option for monetary policy makers. The real question is whether the risks that Mr. Powell and his Fed colleagues took were sensible given the likely alternatives.</p><p>The high inflation that followed in 2021 might have been worse if the U.S. had seen more widespread bankruptcies or permanent job losses in the early months of the pandemic. On the other hand, an additional burst of stimulus spending in 2021, as vaccines hastened the reopening of the economy, raised the risk that monetary and fiscal policy together would flood the economy with money and further fuel inflation.</p><p>The surge in federal borrowing since 2020 creates other risks. It is manageable for now but could become very expensive if the Fed has to lift interest rates aggressively to cool the economy and reduce high inflation.</p><p>The federal debt rose by $5 trillion between February 2020 and June 2021, to $22.2 trillion, and the Fed's holdings of that public debt rose by more than $2.5 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office forecast in December 2020 that if rates rose by just 0.1 percentage point more than projected in each year of the decade, debt-service costs in 2030 would rise by $235 billion—more than the Pentagon had requested to spend in 2022 on the Navy.</p><p>Another key issue is the growing class divide. Trillions of dollars in triage can save the financial system, but the Fed's economic-stabilization tools are blunt. They operate primarily through financial markets, and its low-rate policies have coincided with—and critics say it has contributed to—a longer-running widening of wealth inequality.</p><p>In 2008, household wealth fell by $8 trillion. It rose by $13.5 trillion in 2020, and in the process, spotlighted the unequal distribution of wealth-building assets such as houses and stocks. Without heavy spending from Washington, focused on the needs of the least well-off, these disparities might have attracted more negative scrutiny.</p><p>Finally, the Fed is a technocratic body that can move quickly because it operates under few political constraints. Turning to it as the first line of defense in this and future crises could compromise its institutional independence. Mr. Powell knew there were risks with the central bank's incursion into credit policy, but he concluded it would be nearly impossible for the Fed to hold back on certain uses of its authorized powers \"because we find it icky,\" he said to his staff.</p><p>Step one, he said, was to get in the fight and try to win. Figuring out how to exit would be a better problem to have, because it would mean they had succeeded.</p><p>But he saw the risk. Having crossed familiar boundaries, there was a danger, he understood, that lawmakers would come to the Fed later and say, \"Fix climate change\" or \"Use your digital printing press to finance every highway repair.\" Mr. Powell told his staff, \"There will come a time when we're saying 'No' to people.\"</p><p>The final verdict on the 2020 crisis response may turn on whether Mr. Powell is able to bring inflation under control without a painful recession—either as sharp price increases from 2021 reverse on their own accord, as officials initially anticipated, or because the Fed cools down the economy by raising interest rates.</p><p>\"We have a recovery that looks completely unlike other recoveries that we've had because we've put so much support behind the recovery,\" Mr. Powell said last month. \"Was it too much? I'm going to leave that to the historians.\"</p><p>Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com</p><p>This essay is adapted from Mr. Timiraos's new book, \"Trillion Dollar Triage: How Jay Powell and the Fed Battled a President and a Pandemic—and Prevented Economic Disaster,\" which will be published by Little, Brown on March 1.
