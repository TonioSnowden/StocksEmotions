  "title": "Richmond Fed's Barkin Says a March Rate Rise Is Conceivable; Regional Fed bank chief tells Wall Street Journal he supports hawkish outlook",
  "text": "<p>At the gathering, Fed officials put the asset buying effort on track to end in March and penciled in three interest rate increases to their now near-zero short-term interest rate target range for this year. The Fed's shift from previously leaning toward ultra easy monetary policy came amid rising concern among central bank officials about high inflation levels. By ending its bond purchases sooner, the Fed expects it will have more flexibility to raise its federal-funds rate target to restrain rising prices.</p><p>Several Fed officials have said the March FOMC meeting could be the time to raise short-term rates. Mr. Barkin, who had an FOMC vote last year but won't this year due to the rotation of regional Fed bank presidents, said he agrees with that outlook.</p><p>\"If you've got an economy that continues the levels of unemployment that we're living through now, which of course is very healthy, with price pressures elevated, I think according to our mandate and framework, we need to move toward normalization,\" Mr. Barkin said.</p><p>\"I certainly think it's conceivable\" the Fed will be able to lift rates at the March FOMC meeting, he added.</p><p>Mr. Barkin's comments on the interest rate outlook came as some private-sector forecasters brace for an aggressive path of rate rises that outstrips what the Fed now thinks is likely for 2022.</p><p>Over the weekend, economists at Goldman Sachs wrote they believe the Fed will raise rates four times this year. Meanwhile, William Dudley, who led the New York Fed from 2009 to 2018 and was once Goldman Sachs's chief economist, said on Bloomberg's television channel he sees four and maybe even five increases in 2022, amid central bank overconfidence that inflation will wane in an economy with very tight labor markets.</p><p>Mr. Barkin said in the interview that he expects inflation pressures will ease later this year, but noted that supply chains continue to be hard hit due to the coronavirus pandemic and that may persist into 2023, adding uncertainty to the economic outlook.</p><p>For now the economy is benefiting from strong consumer demand while household debt levels are relatively low, Mr. Barkin said.</p><p>The official weighed in after the release of payroll data on Friday that showed a weaker than expected gain of 199,00 jobs in December, although the unemployment rate fell from 4.2% in November to 3.9%, a historically strong level. Meanwhile, labor-force participation stood at 61.9% in December, compared with its pre-pandemic level of 63.4%</p><p>With many workers apparently still refraining from re-entering the labor force amid the pandemic, the job market \"is as tight as it could be at this point,\" Mr. Barkin said. \"I still believe that there's more slack in the system\" with about 3.5 million missing workers, but it will take time for these people to look for jobs again, he added.</p><p>\"It's an interim full employment\" that will show signs of moving toward full employment only when the labor-force participation rate picks up and indicates sidelined workers are starting to return to the job market, Mr. Barkin said.</p><p>Write to Michael S.
