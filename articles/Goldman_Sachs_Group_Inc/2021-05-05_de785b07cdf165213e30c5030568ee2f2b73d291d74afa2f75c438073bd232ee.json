Now the merger is on hold.</p> <p>Market experts predict Momentus won't be the only company left in limbo that had hoped to fast-track their way on to public markets via a Spac.</p> <p>Wall Street's top regulator has cast a spotlight on Spacs, dampening the mood in the hottest sector of the US stock market. (Ironically, the UK is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9e9de26-7f44-41e1-9dd6-3721a52c7d9c\">racing to change</a> its rules to attract Spacs.)</p> <p>Last month the SEC issued two statements that struck at the heart of the Spac boom.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/spacs-ipos-liability-risk-under-securities-laws\">first</a> tackled rosy projections — which are used to lure investors — that companies going public via Spacs can show, because the transaction is considered to be a merger rather than a listing.&#xa0;</p> <p>Critics often refer to this as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e892b37f-fe31-46ff-ad25-2b6344db0d54\">“regulatory arbitrage”</a> since companies going public through an IPO face serious liabilities from making forward-looking statements.</p> <p><strong>John Coates</strong>, the acting director of the division of corporation finance, indicated that things should change. “If we do not treat the de-Spac transaction as the ‘real IPO', our attention may be focused on the wrong place,” he wrote in April.</p> <p>Then came a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/accounting-reporting-warrants-issued-spacs\">statement on warrants</a>. We've explained before why these are so crucial to a Spac's success. They act as a<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/812b243b-4831-4c65-92b2-f72bfdc6eff6\"> sweetener for early investors</a> such as hedge funds who get them for free when they buy into the structure.&#xa0;</p> <p>Spacs have treated warrants as equity (they can be converted into shares once a deal has been agreed), but the SEC has said they should be treated as liabilities, punching a hole into the balance sheet of some Spacs and leaving others scrambling to revise their numbers.</p> <p>It doesn't look like things are about to get any easier, either. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/063acde7-a977-4d28-a3ae-27dedfd69a33\"><strong>Gary Gensler</strong></a>, the former <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>banker and new SEC chair, is known for being tough on Wall Street and taking aim at opaque markets. Not a great combination for Spacs.</p> <p>The regulatory scrutiny, coupled with investor fatigue, have contributed to a slowdown in the Spac market. Less than a dozen Spacs listed in April and deals have slowed to a trickle.&#xa0;</p> <p>Meanwhile, if Momentus is to fulfil its space mission, it needs Stable Road shareholders on Thursday to approve a three-month extension to complete the transaction.&#xa0;</p> <p>They'll have to consider whether they still want to invest in the company without its founder <strong>Mikhail Kokorich</strong>, who stepped down as chief executive after Momentus was informed by the<strong> Department of Defense</strong> that it was seen as a risk to national security. Kokorich maintains the company poses no threat.</p> <p>Go deeper <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99de2333-e53a-4084-8780-2ba9766c70b7\">with this big read</a> by DD's Miles Kruppa and Ortenca Aliaj.</p> <h2>The kingmakers in an €18bn private equity takeover battle&#xa0;</h2> <p>Almost six months after private equity interest in the Dutch national telecoms champion<strong> KPN</strong> was first reported, the company has finally found its voice.&#xa0;</p> <p>In response to an FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d2ae0cb-8d26-428b-aef9-5bffa0bd66eb\">scoop</a> over the weekend, KPN said it had rejected two takeover approaches — one from <strong>EQT Partners</strong> and <strong>Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners</strong>, and another from <strong>KKR</strong>. Either would amount to one of the biggest private equity takeover attempts in European history.&#xa0;</p> <p>DD was surprised that it had taken so long for KPN to confirm the approaches, and even more surprised that it said EQT's proposal didn't include a price. (Note: EQT has been linked with a €3-a-share bid, valuing the company at about €18bn including debt.)&#xa0;</p> <p>Neither KPN — whose shares rose 16 per cent to €2.64 in the days before Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-12/eqt-said-to-make-takeover-approach-to-13-billion-carrier-kpn?sref=OziMsGoK\">first reported</a> EQT's interest in November — nor the Dutch system of takeover regulation, comes out of the situation looking great. KPN sits at €2.77 as of Tuesday's close.</p> <p>Machinations on a possible deal are likely to continue, even after KPN said the approaches “did not provide tangible and material added value” to its new strategy and there “are no discussions or negotiations with EQT/Stonepeak or KKR”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Analysts are now arguing that a bid of as much as €3.80 per share could be justified, if the buyers think they can easily break up KPN — a big “if”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Both EQT and KKR are already involved in the market — EQT owns <strong>Delta Fiber</strong>, a smaller Dutch rival of KPN's, and KKR's Open Dutch Fibre joint venture with <strong>Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners</strong> is working with <strong>T-Mobile Netherlands</strong> to build fibre-optic networks in Dutch cities.</p> <p>Two possible kingmakers to watch: the Dutch government, and the Mexican billionaire <strong>Carlos Slim</strong>, who owns a 20 per cent stake in KPN.&#xa0;</p> <p>The government will have to decide whether it will allow private equity to intercept a critical national asset. Slim will have to decide whether to help the buyout groups succeed where he failed.&#xa0;</p> <p>His<strong> América Móvil </strong>group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34321a5e-3683-11e3-8ae3-00144feab7de\">tried to acquire</a> KPN for €7.2bn in 2013 but was blocked by the intervention of an independent foundation linked to the telecoms group.&#xa0;</p> <p>On top of his stake, he raised €2.1bn of bonds via a Dutch subsidiary in February which could be converted into shares. So his stance will be critical.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Tiger Global's insatiable hunt for deals</h2> <p>A few months ago, DD <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/641d2ad8-b122-42d5-9562-e6aec03ddb36\">cast an eye</a> on <strong>Tiger Global Management</strong>'s dealmaking frenzy, and how it has been raising eyebrows in Silicon Valley.</p> <p>Now, the New York-based firm wants to up the ante even further. As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11834bc1-f9b3-43a8-b142-7e890d85a11e\">first reported</a> by DD's Miles Kruppa, Tiger Global recently told investors it was targeting $10bn for its next private investment fund, just weeks after raising its most recent version.</p> <p>That total would make it the largest fund raised by an independent fund manager for minority investments in technology start-ups, per<strong> PitchBook</strong> data.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sure, <strong>SoftBank </strong>raised $100bn for its first <strong>Vision Fund</strong>, but that was a bit of a different beast. Tiger is asking hundreds of investors, including foundations and endowments, to come along for the ride, and has begun fundraising just weeks after securing a $6.7bn fund.</p> <p>It appears that the fund needs the money to keep up with its rapid pace.</p> <p>So far this year through to the end of Monday, the firm had participated in 100 deals that raised a total of $22.2bn for private tech companies, according to PitchBook. Those numbers are, frankly, eye-popping.</p> <p>In the near term, Tiger Global's fundraising fever means that the party in Silicon Valley is still in full swing.&#xa0;</p> <p>Take comfort, start-up founders.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Blackstone</strong> has hired <strong>Paget MacColl</strong> as global head of <strong>Blackstone Alternative Asset Management</strong>'s institutional client solutions.
