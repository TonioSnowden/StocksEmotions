  "text": "<p>As of Tuesday, one dollar USDCNH was worth 7.2538 offshore yuan. The offshore yuan refers to the value of the renminbi trading outside mainland China.</p><p>The dollar has surged against many rivals, including a 14% gain this year against China's yuan, on a combination of the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates aggressively while China feels the effect of its strict zero-COVID policy on economic activity.</p><p>Goldman Sachs GS was the counterparty for all of these trades, according to SEC filings.</p><p>It's not clear if Morgan Stanley has taken all, or some, of the bet off the table but as of late August, the trades were still in place, according to filings. For that matter, Goldman Sachs may have hedged all or part of the trade.</p><p>Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while Goldman Sachs didn't return a message.</p><p>The publication Risk said the bets had a notional value of $9.4 billion, and said Morgan Stanley has paid more than $400 million in premiums to run the strategy.</p><p>Morgan Stanley funds have similar trades in place for next year, with JPMorgan Chase JPM as the counterparty.</p><p>â€” Jamie Chisholm contributed to this article</p><p>A big bet from Morgan Stanley funds on the value of the Chinese yuan is close to strike price ahead of Thursday expiration</p>",
