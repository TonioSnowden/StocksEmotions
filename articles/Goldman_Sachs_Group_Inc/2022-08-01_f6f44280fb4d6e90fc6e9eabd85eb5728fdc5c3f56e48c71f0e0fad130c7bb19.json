  "text": "<h1>The power struggle unfolding at one of the world's most secretive sovereign wealth funds </h1> <p>We've been looking into issues at Kuwait's secretive sovereign wealth fund for several months now. It was dragged into the public spotlight last month when <strong>Saleh al-Ateeqi</strong>, the head of its London office, was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d48d0a44-8fee-4e34-bcfc-66edfdc85b12\">abruptly fired</a>. <br><br>For decades, the <strong>Kuwait Investment Authority</strong> kept a low profile as it garnered a reputation as one of the oil-rich Gulf's most powerful and respected sovereign wealth funds. But behind closed doors, the organisation, which has over $700bn in assets under management, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2d7b536-c4c6-49ee-9a2c-63d6a81cff0f\">riven by conflict</a> as modernisers, an entrenched old guard and disaffected employees all jockey for influence, according to more than a dozen current and former staff interviewed by the <em>Financial Times</em>. <br><br>The fund has not explained its decision to fire Ateeqi, which capped a four-year period in which the KIA became embroiled in a string of legal battles with former staff, internal investigations and rising tensions between the London office and leadership in Kuwait. <br><br>Ateeqi's backers said his firing was politically motivated, blaming a power struggle between those attempting to reform the fund and veterans at the KIA. “It's chaos there now, with various factions pitted against one another,” said a fund manager who invests on behalf of the KIA. &#xa0;<br><br>Changes started to ripple through the traditionally conservative fund from 2017, according to people familiar with the matter, when <strong>Bader al-Saad</strong>, who had been the dominant figure at the KIA for over a decade, stepped down as managing director. His successor, <strong>Farouk Bastaki</strong>, and a freshly appointed board wanted to modernise the fund, the people said.<br><br>But Ateeqi's approach stirred resentment within the KIA and led to an outflow of staff from the London office, according to current and former employees. Some of them said Ateeqi, a Wharton graduate who once worked as an adviser to former UK prime minister <strong>Tony Blair</strong>, had shaken up a sleepy organisation and supported high performers. But others described a turbulent, dysfunctional work environment rife with bullying.<br><br>“The culture of the office has drastically changed from what it was. Within six months of arriving, [Ateeqi] started wielding the axe and it hasn't been the same place since,” said a person who has worked at the KIO, referring to departures of employees. “The culture is awful.”</p> <p>Read the full investigation, by my colleagues <em>Adrienne Klasa</em>, <em>Andrew England</em> and <em>Simeon Kerr</em>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2d7b536-c4c6-49ee-9a2c-63d6a81cff0f\">here</a>.</p> <h1>‘I think we're in for a volatile second half'</h1> <p>Last week was a busy week for corporate earnings. The varying fortunes of a handful of asset managers were a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/abc8a2f3-4f4d-4ef0-ab04-a24b8fde6e51?\">good illustration</a> of some of the themes shaping the industry.</p> <p>Resilient results from the likes of <strong>Schroders</strong> and <strong>Amundi</strong> illustrate how larger, diversified groups with exposure to faster-growing areas such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1d8ae4d-30c6-4172-ba4d-729e3bf08bac\">private assets</a>, responsible investing and wealth management will probably fare better and have the firepower to continue to invest.<br><br>Meanwhile it was a bleaker picture at <strong>Janus Henderson</strong> and <strong>Jupiter</strong>, both of which have recently changed their chief executives and are facing additional company-specific headwinds, exacerbating challenging overall market conditions.</p> <p>Janus Henderson, the result of a merger between asset managers <strong>Janus Capital Group</strong> and <strong>Henderson Group</strong> five years ago, said that its assets under management dropped by 17 per cent in the second quarter to $299.7bn, lower than the $331bn the two combined oversaw following the merger. The group lost market share due to poor fund performance.<br><br>Meanwhile&#xa0;Jupiter said on Friday that assets under management dropped by a fifth in the first half of the year, to £48.8bn, driven by poor investment performance and £3.6bn in net outflows. Jupiter said it has paused hiring and non-essential investments until markets improve.</p> <p>In the short term, asset managers are bracing themselves for a volatile second half after this year's big fall in markets has left them racing to protect their profitability and pivot towards faster-growing areas. </p> <p>“The economic outlook is incredibly tough,” said <strong>Peter Harrison</strong>, chief executive of London-listed Schroders, which oversees £773.4bn in assets under management. “There are inflationary pressures that aren't going to abate quickly and a war in Ukraine which isn't going to end for a considerable while.” </p> <p>Economic headwinds should result in markets remaining difficult, he added: “I think we're in for a volatile second half.”</p> <p>Longer term, however, asset managers were more optimistic about the future. “The long-term growth trends of the asset management industry have not changed at all, they remain absolutely intact,” said <strong>Valérie Baudson</strong>, chief executive of Amundi, Europe's largest asset manager with €1.93tn in assets under management. She pointed to structural themes including funding the retirement of an ageing population, a growing middle class in Asia and the need to finance the energy transition away from fossil fuels to renewables.</p> <h1>Chart of the week</h1> <p>Crypto investors are showing signs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89312290-ce33-4f94-9789-07fc7d7ab853\">of renewed confidence</a>, with digital assets' market cap rising $280bn in July after a painful sell-off and credit crisis that had scared many players out of the market. </p> <p>Investment products tracking cryptoassets have pulled in just under $400mn since the start of July, racking up the longest run of sustained weekly net inflows since March, according to data from crypto asset management group <strong>Coinshares</strong>. </p> <p>“We're starting to see some bold investors come in [and] take . . . long positions, and people are not adding to short positions now”, said Coinshares' head of research <strong>James Butterfill</strong>. </p> <p>The early signs of a rebound follow a period of sharp declines for the digital assets industry. Bitcoin, the world's flagship cryptocurrency, fell by as much as 70 per cent from its all-time high in November, while the size of the digital asset market tipped below $1tn, down from a November high over $3tn. </p> <p>Want to know more about what's happening in digital asset markets?
