The fund has increased its exposure since then. It invested $10 million in a $1 billion Luna sale by Luna Foundation Guard in February, among other commitments, according to the post.</p><p>The fund currently sits on a large unrealized loss, the firm said in the post. At Luna's peak price of $119.5 in April, the coin and other Terra assets made up a total of 13% of the net asset value across Delphi Ventures, according to the post. Companies or protocols related to the Terra ecosystem made up less than 5% of Delphi's total number of deals, the firm said.</p><p>Binance: Binance previously bought 15 million Luna for $3 million, according to Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, chief executive at the crypto exchange. Such a holding now is worth about $2,400, based on Luna's recent price at $0.00016, according to CoinDesk data. The company has never moved or sold those tokens, Zhao wrote in a tweet Monday.</p><p>Galaxy Digital: Once a backer of Luna, billionaire investor Michael Novogratz in January got a wolf-themed tattoo to show his support for the cryptocurrency.</p><p>As Luna collapsed, the ink \"will be a constant reminder that venture investing requires humility,\" Novogratz wrote in an open letter published Wednesday.</p><p>The principal investments team of Galaxy Digital, where Novogratz serves as a chief executive, invested in Luna in the fourth quarter of 2020 using balance sheet capital, Novogratz wrote in the letter. The firm's treasury doesn't use algorithmic stablecoin, he added.</p><p>The billionaire said the collapse of UST and Luna serves as a reminder that in investing, it's important to \"keep a diversified portfolio, take profits along the way, have a risk management framework, and understand that all investments happen in a macro framework.\"</p><p>\"Galaxy did all of these with regards to our investment in LUNA,\" according to Novogratz.</p><p>The firm expects a $300 million loss in net comprehensive income this quarter as of May 11, bringing the partners' capital to $2.2 billion, down 12% from March 31, according to a preliminary update released on May 13.</p><p>Crypto companies, funds</p><p>Shares of Coinbase Global Inc.
