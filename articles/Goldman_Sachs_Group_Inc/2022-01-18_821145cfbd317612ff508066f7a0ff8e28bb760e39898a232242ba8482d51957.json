  "text": "<p>Oil prices hit a more than seven-year high on Tuesday, threatening to fuel a further rise in global inflation, on bets that demand for crude could outstrip supply later this year. </p> <p>Brent, the international benchmark, rose 1.9 per cent to a high of $88.13 a barrel on Tuesday, the highest level since October 2014 when oil topped $115. </p> <p>Both Brent and the US oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate have risen about 13 per cent since the start of year, with WTI reaching a high of $85.74. Some analysts forecast the crude benchmarks could trade at more than $100 a barrel this year unless supply is increased.</p> <p>Paul Horsnell, commodities strategist at Standard Chartered, said traders were betting that supply would struggle to keep up with demand as the global economy continues to rebound from the coronavirus-induced slowdown that began in 2020.</p> <p>“The jury's out on what is the spare capacity, but once the perception is in there that it's wafer thin, that's what pushes prices higher,” he said.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs expects oil inventories across OECD countries to reach their lowest levels since 2000 by the middle of the year, pushing Brent prices as high as $96 a barrel in 2022 and $105 a barrel in 2023.</p> <p>The US has called on the world's leading oil producers, represented by Opec, to increase production faster to help control inflation. US consumer price growth&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b90f59e1-79c2-403d-94a9-776555c541fc\">increased 7 per cent</a>&#xa0;year on year in December, the fastest pace since 1982.</p> <p>But Opec and its allies have so far stuck to a plan agreed in July to replace output cut at the start of the pandemic gradually, by just 400,000 barrels a day each month.</p> <p>The strategy has helped oil prices track higher since August but not all members of the Opec+ group — which has included Russia since 2016 — have been able to hit their monthly targets raising fears that there is limited spare production capacity in the market.</p> <p>Production figures released by Opec on Tuesday showed monthly output increased&#xa0;in December in Angola, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates but declined in Nigeria and Libya.</p> <p>Total spare capacity among Opec+ members was forecast to reach “historically low levels” of about 1.2m b/d by the summer, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note.</p> <p>Such capacity concerns have been compounded since the start of the year by more supply disruption in Libya and a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7c87c71-8e43-48a1-bfea-bfc2b6e9c6b2\">drone attack on Monday</a> near an oil depot in the UAE by Yemen's Houthi rebels, which has provoked fears of renewed risks to production in the Gulf.</p> <p>“Traders will always want to get ahead of a story,” said Horsnell. However, he added that Standard Chartered's calculations suggested no supply deficit would materialise until 2024.</p> <p>“I think there is enough spare capacity in Saudi [Arabia], in Iraq, in the Emirates and in bits and pieces elsewhere to mean that there are no circumstances this year, short of a major geopolitical supply interruption, where spare capacity is likely to fall below 3m barrels a day and start feeling a little bit tight.”</p><p>Source: Tom Wilson and Sarah Provan in London 2022 'Oil prices hit highest level since 2014 over supply concerns' FT.com 18 January.
