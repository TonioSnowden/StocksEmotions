  "title": "Banking & Finance: Hertz Seeks to List Stock on Nasdaq",
  "text": "<p>The proposed sale of stock represents a large windfall to the investor group who helped fund Hertz's exit from chapter 11 in June, including Knighthead Capital Management LLC, Certares Opportunities LLC, and Apollo Global Management Inc.</p><p>Hertz stock, which trades over the counter, fell 10% to $31.60 on Wednesday afternoon. The shares had more than doubled from August through Tuesday's close.</p><p>The rental-car company's stock has traded over the counter since it was delisted last year after the company went bankrupt.</p><p>Hertz said Wednesday it has applied to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol HTZ.</p><p>A Hertz representative wasn't immediately available for comment.</p><p>Hertz's stock price rose sharply after announcing last week a deal to buy 100,000 Teslas.</p><p>Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk cast doubt on the deal when he said late Monday on Twitter that a contract has yet to be signed with Hertz.</p><p>The car-rental company on Tuesday stood by its announcement and said Tesla deliveries have already begun, but a spokeswoman declined to say whether there was a contract between the two companies.</p><p>In the Wednesday filing, Hertz said Knighthead and Certares will own 37.2% of the company after the offering assuming the underwriters' option is exercised in full.</p><p>The two firms billed themselves as long-term investors in Hertz during the chapter 11 bankruptcy, when two competing groups of investors jockeyed to own the rental-car company in an auction process.</p><p>Hertz said it intends to buy between $250 million and $500 million of the common shares from the underwriters. It also said it intends to make an offer to purchase the company's outstanding $1.5 billion preferred stock, provided by Apollo, by the end of this year.</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities, and Morgan Stanley are acting as lead bookrunning managers for the proposed offering, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.</p>",
