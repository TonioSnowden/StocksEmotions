  "text": "<p>Argentine fintech Ualá has established its place in the ranks of Latin America's unicorns despite the country's troubled economy, as groups including SoftBank and Tencent tap into a regional shift from cash towards digital services. </p> <p>The start-up secured $350m in private funding during its latest investment round — the biggest of the kind secured by an Argentine company — helping it reach a $2.45bn valuation, it said on Friday. The group was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a809d6f1-ef4a-4f5c-89f4-819c46611a4c\">valued at $900m</a> last year. </p> <p>Ualá's fundraising was led by its existing backers: the SoftBank Latin America Fund, an arm of the Japanese conglomerate, and China's Tencent. </p> <p>Other existing investors, including funds managed by Soros and Goldman Sachs also joined, as well as smaller US investment groups and WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann.&#xa0;</p> <p>Ualá offers debit cards and a digital payments service tied to a global Mastercard, allowing customers to pay bills, invest and take loans or insurance straight from its app. </p> <p>It is not currently allowed to hold deposits but has purchased a bank licence in Argentina for which it is awaiting regulatory approval.</p> <p>Its Series D fundraising is the latest in a wave of foreign investment into Latin American fintechs, with interest in the sector rising even before the pandemic caused the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23db80d4-6193-4b22-8b15-074ba2f96d1c\">use of digital banking and cashless services</a> to surge. </p> <p>Private investment in the sector during the first half of 2021 was $7.6bn, far surpassing the $3bn raised for all of 2020, according to data compiled by the Latam Fintech Hub website. </p> <p>Recent acquisitions have included JPMorgan's purchase of a <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/announce/full?dockey=600-202106281205BIZWIRE_USPRX____BW5666-1\">40 per cent stake in Brazil's C6 Bank</a> while 92 deals were announced in the three months to June 30, more than twice as many in the same period a year earlier. </p> <p>Ualá, which launched in Mexico last year, is targeting the rest of Spanish-speaking Latin America for growth, having secured permits to operate in Colombia.</p> <p>It has issued 3.5m cards in the four years since its launch, with more than 1m users investing in its mutual fund. </p> <p>“Ualá has already demonstrated impressive traction in Argentina and Mexico, and we believe they have a significant opportunity to expand in broader Latin America,” said David Silverman, an investor at New York-based D1 Capital Partners, which is making its first investment in the company.</p> <p>Ualá's success follows in the footsteps of Uruguay's dLocal, a cross-border payments platform that was recently valued at $5bn, and Argentine ecommerce giant <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/446558a8-c0b2-449c-97a5-53b3956cd427\">MercadoLibre</a>, which has its own MercadoPago payment service following the blueprint of Alibaba's Alipay.</p> <p>“We admire how MercadoLibre started with a very successful marketplace, and built fintech around it [but] our strategy is different,” said Ualá founder and chief executive Pierpaolo Barbieri. “We are focused on creating a deep fintech ecosystem because we believe in providing more innovative, transparent, and inclusive financial products for all Mexicans and Argentines.”</p> <p>There is an idealistic element to Ualá's branding, which positions itself as a modern alternative to out-of-touch banks and predatory loan sharks. </p> <p>Banking the unbanked, they say, is a social goal and a profit opportunity, with 75 per cent of transactions in Argentina and 80 per cent in Mexico still conducted in cash.</p> <p>The pandemic has provided an impetus for change with about 20 per cent of Latin America's unbanked population opening their first account during the crisis in order to access governmental aid, according to data provider Americas Market Intelligence.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Fintech is probably the hottest area in the global internet economy, and [traditional] financial institutions in second- and third-world countries are exceptionally poor and expensive,” said AlleyCorp's Kevin Ryan, another investor.</p> <p>“There's a social mission part of this, helping people who've been hiding money under their mattresses, and helping the state as well, because these people can develop an internet economy and will eventually pay taxes,” he added. </p><p>Source: Ignacio Portes in Buenos Aires  2021 'SoftBank-backed Argentine fintech valued at almost $2.5bn' FT.com 13 August.
