  "text": "<p>Professor Theo Vermaelen of Insead writes that “no bank has an impact on the climate” and that investors who allow climate to influence investment decisions are behaving emotionally, not rationally (“No place for emotion in climate ETF investing”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7e2d6e6-a230-4abf-9107-b7661462e677\">Letters</a>, February 22).</p> <p>Meanwhile, BlackRock tells me that sustainability is its standard for investing, Goldman Sachs says that the climate transition and inclusive growth are the two holistic pillars that underpin its work and AllianzGI (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/323d8f16-9fca-4350-ae74-b77aca1cfcac\">Report</a>, February 22) says it will vote against European companies that fail to link pay to environmental, social and governance principles. </p> <p>Are these giant banks and investment managers not behaving rationally or simply misleading us? </p> <p>Or is Insead not preparing its students properly for the world of finance today?</p> <p><strong>Christopher Gibbs</strong> <br><em>Villars, France</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: A question for banks  and for business schools' FT.com 25 February.
