  "title": "Stock Markets Wobble as Omicron Fuels More Volatility; Investors struggle to assess implications of coronavirus variant on business, economies",
  "text": "<p>Major U.S. indexes started the day on an upbeat note, with stocks attempting to rebound from a post-Thanksgiving selloff. The rally lost steam in the afternoon after reports that new Covid-19 infections nearly doubled in South Africa Wednesday and that the Covid-19 Omicron variant was identified in California. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the person, who was fully vaccinated, returned from South Africa on Nov. 22. The person has mild symptoms that are improving, the agency said.</p><p>U.S. indexes trimmed their gains and then tumbled following the reports. The Dow Jones Industrial Average recently lost about 240 points, or 0.7%. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 declined 0.5%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 1.1%.</p><p>The emergence of the Omicron variant is injecting heightened uncertainty into financial markets at a time when investors were already trying to ascertain the impact of rising inflation on the market. Investors have little to go on as they assess whether the variant will lead to renewed restrictions in the U.S. and elsewhere and, if so, how governments and central banks would respond to support the economy.</p><p>One cause of concern among investors is the question of how effective Covid-19 vaccines will be against the new variant. Though drugmakers have said the variant first identified in South Africa looks like it could make existing vaccines less effective, they expect to be able to update the shots.</p><p>\"Volatility in the short run should be expectedâ€”ultimately, we're dealing with a little more uncertainty than we have been,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer of Independent Advisor Alliance. \"There's enough cause for concern that people are shooting first and asking questions later.\"</p><p>For his part, Mr. Zaccarelli said his Charlotte-based firm has been delaying expanding its positioning in cyclical sectors due to concerns about Covid-19, and currently remains balanced between growth and value stocks. \"We feel like in the absence of perfect information, it makes sense to prepare for either scenario,\" he said.</p><p>Among the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors, only the utilities, healthcare and consumer staples groups traded higher Wednesday afternoon. The sectors are typically viewed as more defensive havens within the stock market.</p><p>Vaccine-maker Moderna tumbled, losing 11%. Pfizer, in contrast, ticked up 2%. Salesforce.com lost 11% after the software company's guidance for fourth-quarter earnings fell short of expectations.</p><p>Treasury yields fell, also reversing gains from earlier in the day, as investors sought safety in government bonds. Yields fall when bond prices rise. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes slid to 1.428% from 1.440% Tuesday.</p><p>\"We just don't know how much more infectious it is, how severe the symptoms are and what the impact of that is,\" said Sebastian Mackay, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco, of the Omicron variant. \"What I'd assume now is this probably isn't enough to derail the recovery that's going on.\"</p><p>Invesco's multiasset funds have bought stocks at cheaper levels since Omicron first rattled markets last week, Mr. Mackay added.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent oil prices, which have tumbled recently on signs Omicron could curtail demand for jet fuel, fell 0.5% to $68.87 a barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets Wednesday and Thursday to determine its response to recent price declines.</p><p>Analysts say the cartel, still holding back production in tandem with allies led by Russia, may pause plans to pump more oil in January, or further cut output. Goldman Sachs analysts said recent price declines suggest traders are preparing for daily global oil demand to fall by more than 7% over the next three months.</p><p>Another cause for concern, stock investors say, is that the rapid pace of inflation could prevent the Fed and other central banks from unleashing stimulus in the event of severe disruption caused by Omicron. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell added to those worries Tuesday when he opened the door to an interest-rate risein the first half of 2022.</p><p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Wednesday it expects consumer-price inflation in the U.S. to average 4.4% in 2022, up from the 3.1% forecast in September. The forecasts were made before the Omicron variant was discovered. However, the research body's chief economist said the world could experience price declines if the new variant sidesteps existing vaccines.</p><p>Overseas markets gained. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.7%, led higher by shares of travel, leisure and basic-resource companies, which would all be exposed to an economic downturn.</p><p>Asian markets were broadly higher. South Korea's Kospi added 2.1% while Japan's Nikkei 225 and China's Shanghai Composite rose 0.4%.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com and Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Markets Wobble as Omicron Fuels More Volatility</p>",
