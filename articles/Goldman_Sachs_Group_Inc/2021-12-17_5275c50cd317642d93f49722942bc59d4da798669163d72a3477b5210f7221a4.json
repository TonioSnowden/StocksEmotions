  "title": "MANSION  ---  Food & Wine Issue:  Bugatti [check]  Patek Philippe [check]  North Fork Vineyard [check]  ---  A Long Island vineyard, winery or grape-ready land  is the hot new status symbol for acquisitive millionaires  ----  By Beth Landman",
  "text": "<p>   Randy Frankel sported white patched jeans and a snug T-shirt that telegraphed his current passions -- Weekends, Wine and Dogs -- as he cradled a 4-pound Yorkie and surveyed his latest acquisition, Ruland Farm. He purchased the 66-acre property on Long Island's North Fork in July 2021 for just under $3.2 million. Now he is transforming it to a vineyard, while restoring its 2,500-square-foot home for the use of his daughters. The home, originally 1,200 square feet, was built in 1716, according to Mr. Frankel. </p><p>   A former partner at Goldman Sachs, general partner in the Tampa Bay Rays and longtime Hamptons homeowner, Mr. Frankel, 64, first purchased land on Suffolk County's less swanky north side in 2017 when he took over Mattituck's Shinn Estate Vineyards and rebranded it Rose Hill. Two years later, he became the majority owner of Croteaux, a vineyard in nearby Southold. </p><p>   \"I've been buying farms all around and I'm closing in on 500 acres,\" he said. \"I co-own a baseball team, four soccer teams in Europe and four country clubs in Florida. I buy stuff,\" he said. </p><p>   Recently, some prominent people have purchased properties on Long Island's North Fork, including ABC News Chief Legal Correspondent Dan Abrams; real-estate mogul Sheldon Solow's son and heir Stefan Soloviev; and Maria Rivero Gonzalez, whose family owns a vineyard in Mexico. </p><p>   Whether they are oenophiles or novices, these new owners have high hopes for their crops and plans to turn the assets into profitable businesses. And the real estate itself has become a good investment. </p><p>   While Mr. Frankel has grown to love wine, it was never an obsession until he owned his first vineyard. Mr. Abrams, 55, who purchased Laurel Lake Vineyards for $2.5 million earlier this year, was a partner in Manhattan restaurants and has been a longtime connoisseur. </p><p>   \"I have three wine refrigerators in my apartment,\" said Mr. Abrams, \"and a separate basement for storage in my house.\" He says he is still learning as he goes. \"I never thought about the quality of corks before. Now I'm an expert!\" </p><p>   Mr. Abrams is thinking of his vineyard as a legacy, having rebranded it Ev&amp;Em, after his children, Everett and Emilia. \"I hope they are into it, and that North Fork wineries are a big deal when they are older,\" he said. \"There is a real opportunity to get in now before it becomes the next Sonoma or Walla Walla.\" </p><p>   Like Mr. Frankel, Mr. Abrams still has his Long Island home in the Hamptons rather than on the North Fork, but he has relocated from Southampton to a waterfront spot in Hampton Bays, less than a half-hour from his vineyard. \"I wanted a place close to the vineyard, but close enough to the South Fork to socialize,\" he said. </p><p>   Both Mr. Abrams and Mr. Frankel first considered buying vineyards on the West Coast, but the travel commitment and price difference sealed their decision to buy on Long Island. \"To buy 25 planted acres in Napa would cost $20 to $30 million,\" said Mr. Frankel, who purchased his first vineyard for just over $3 million. </p><p>   According to Thomas McCloskey, a local broker at Douglas Elliman, prices of homes on the North Fork of Long Island rose steadily by about 4% to 5% starting in 2012, but skyrocketed 25% since the start of the pandemic. This created an incentive for people who had inherited vineyards to sell them. \"Some of these had been vanity projects for the uber-wealthy that were not very profitable,\" he said. \"The children weren't always interested in hanging on to them.\" </p><p>   The new breed of owners is determined to turn things around by upgrading wine quality and improving marketing. \"My rootstock is coming from Northern California and I bought French oak barrels that cost $1,300 each,\" said Mr. Frankel. </p><p>   It was the farmland rather than grapes that drew Stefan Soloviev and his ex-wife, Stacey Soloviev, to these vineyards. \"My ex loves to till the fields and be on the tractor,\" Ms. Soloviev said. \"If you ask what he does, he says 'I'm a farmer.'\" </p><p>   Now 43, Ms. Soloviev relocated from East Hampton with the couple's 11 children when Mr. Soloviev bought Peconic Vineyards, now rebranded Peconic Bay Vineyards, for $4.5 million in 2019. He has since acquired a total of 328 acres of vineyard land at an average of roughly $65,380 per acre, according to Ms. Soloviev. </p><p>   \"If you are an absentee owner showing up and opening bottles for your friends, it would be glamorous, but we are checking fields at 5 a.m. and in the winery until midnight,\" she said. \"People think if you have a winery, you make so much money, but to rebuild it was $400,000 and a harvester costs $500,000.\" </p><p>   Ms. Soloviev has bigger plans than just selling wine, however. Though not all vineyards come with development rights, Peconic Bay did. She has future plans to open a 40-room luxury hotel with a spa, centered on an immersive wine experience. </p><p>   Of all the new owners, Maria Rivero Gonzalez, 38, has the most wine experience. She wanted to expand her family's RGMX vineyard, located in Parras, Coahuila, Mexico, in a place where it could shine. \"I wanted to find an underdog region where we could experiment and really make a mark,\" she said. </p><p>   The Rivero Gonzalez family purchased 205-acre Martha Clara vineyard in Riverhead in 2018 for $15 million and changed the name to RGNY. The property came with a 10,000-square-foot, four-bedroom, four-bathroom house, and a 1,700-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath house. The large house needed about $1 million worth of work including a new roof and windows, a project that is ongoing. \"We are living there now but just put it up for sale,\" she said. </p><p>   Like Peconic, Martha Clara came with development rights. \"I said to my family, 'even if I screw this up, as a real-estate venture it will be successful.'\" Ms. Rivero Gonzalez said that the family is working on creating a residential project that revolves around vineyard living. \"We are looking to partner with a local developer, build homes and curate experiences. We want it to be high end but unpretentious.\" </p><p>   Even for those who don't have major development plans in the works, there is a hospitality element to owning a vineyard. Mr. Abrams said he is putting over $2.5 million into the overhaul of his facility including gutting the tasting room, and Ms. Soloviev has live music and electric carts to shuttle visitors around. </p><p>   On a sunny afternoon, Mr. Frankel and his wife, Barbara Frankel, are  enjoying sparkling rose with guests in the gardens of Croteaux. Mr. Frankel says people envy his venture. </p><p>   \"Do you know how many come up to me here and say it is their dream to own a vineyard?\" he asked. \"I enjoy pouring a glass and walking the fields. I love the farm aspect, but corn and wheat are just not as sexy.\" </p><p></p>",
