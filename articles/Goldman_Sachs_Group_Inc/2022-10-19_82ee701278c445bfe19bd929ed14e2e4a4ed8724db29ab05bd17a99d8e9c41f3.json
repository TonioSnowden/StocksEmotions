  "title": "Stocks Jump on Strong Earnings --- S&P 500 rises almost 4% in past two trading days; Goldman, Lockheed are winners",
  "text": "<p>Big swings have become common for U.S. stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 closing up or down at least 2% in the three prior trading sessions. Even with some runs higher, all three indexes remain in a bear market, entered into after a drop of 20% or more from a recent high.</p><p>\"When you're in the throes of a bear market, to see meaningful moves higher for stocks, you need to also see a big move in the bond markets. You need yields to meaningfully fall,\" said Michael Antonelli, managing director and market strategist at Baird.</p><p>That hasn't happened. Instead, the yields on U.S. government bonds have been climbing, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note settling above 4% for the first time since 2008 on Friday.</p><p>On Tuesday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note edged lower to 3.996% from 4.012%. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Investors had been bracing for a difficult earnings season, with the threats of soaring inflation, rising interest rates and flagging growth weighing on consumer spending and corporate profits. But results thus far have proved better than expected, prompting a rally for U.S. stock markets after months of declines.</p><p>\"Earnings are yet to crack. Consumers seem surprisingly resilient and it feels like companies are kind of keeping their heads above water,\" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street Global Advisors. \"Earnings season hasn't been the collapse that people have been worried about.\"</p><p>On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs rose $7.14, or 2.3%, to $313.85 after it said profit fell in the recent quarter but remained above targets. Lockheed Martin's shares rose $34.53, or 8.7%, to $431.84 after the defense company said its profit rose and maintained its full-year guidance. Shares of Salesforce rose $6.35, or 4.3%, to $153.53 and Splunk gained $2.11, or 2.8%, to $76.15 after activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP discussed the firm's stakes in them at a conference.</p><p>After the market closed, Netflix said it added more than twice as many new subscribers as expected in the last quarter. Shares of the streaming giant rose 14% in after-hours trading. United Airlines rose 7% in after-hours trading after solid results.</p><p>Global markets also got a boost after the U.K. government walked back an unpopular package of tax cuts and government borrowing that had raised concerns about the U.K.'s debt burden and prompted the Bank of England to intervene to stabilize bond markets.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.3%.</p><p>Still, the BOE said it intends to begin selling some of its holdings of government bonds at the end of the month as planned following reports to the contrary.</p><p>Early Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.7%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 0.8%, the Shanghai Composite was down 0.3% and South Korea's Kospi was up 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.8%.</p>",
