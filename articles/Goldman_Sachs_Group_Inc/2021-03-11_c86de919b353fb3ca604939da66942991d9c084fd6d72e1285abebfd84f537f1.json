That was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dca99b97-0ba6-4a68-b0c3-3097719753b7\"><strong>Jack Welch</strong></a>'s nickname for <strong>GE Capital</strong> when General Electric reigned supreme at the end of the last century and its financial arm had become the industrial conglomerate's largest business unit.&#xa0;</p> <p>As Welch's successor <strong>Jeff Immelt</strong> puts it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a64c4356-a42e-4883-acdb-13ced2bdcaea\">in his new book</a>, writes the FT's Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, the theory was “don't look at the elements that make up the Blob, just look at the results”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sure enough, Wall Street didn't ask too many questions about what lurked inside GE Capital — at least until the 2008-09 global financial crisis made its liabilities look life-threatening.</p> <p>In 2008, GE Capital had $660bn of assets, and it was still the largest non-bank lender in the US five years later when its designation as a heavily regulated, systemically relevant financial institution, prompted Immelt to start trying to break it up.&#xa0;</p> <p>But prohibitive tax hurdles and a toxic tail of liabilities meant the Blob, like the star of the 1958 sci-fi horror film of the same name, has proved remarkably hard to kill.&#xa0;</p> <p>Immelt and both of his successors have hacked away at it for some years, with current chief executive <strong>Larry Culp </strong>cutting the division's assets from $86bn to $68bn since 2018.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Culp<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24b5db78-53e7-42f5-8db3-c05eed766675\"> announced an exit</a> from GE Capital's largest remaining business, the aircraft leasing business GECAS.&#xa0;</p> <p>If regulators clear the $30bn-plus sale to Irish rival <strong>AerCap</strong>, it would bring in $24bn of cash to further cut GE's debt load and let it transfer $34bn of GECAS assets to AerCap, chief financial officer <strong>Carolina Dybeck Happe</strong> told analysts, making GE “a more focused and simpler industrial company”.</p> <p>The deal technically marks the end of GE Capital, as the group will no longer break its financial activities out as their own segment, but the Blob isn't quite dead yet.&#xa0;</p> <p>GE will own 46 per cent of the combined aircraft leasing company and is keeping GE Capital's business providing financing to its power and renewables customers and a working capital unit. It will also be running off its insurance liabilities for a while yet.&#xa0;</p> <p>GE Capital's importance in supporting the group's industrial clients meant rating agencies treated it as a captive finance unit and didn't consolidate its financials in their calculations. That would now change, <strong>S&amp;P Global</strong> ratings said on Wednesday, as it warned that it might cut GE's credit rating by one notch in response.&#xa0;</p> <p>Call it the Blob's revenge.</p> <p>*<strong>One note to readers</strong>: We apologise for a technical error that resulted in the lead item in Wednesday's issue being cut short. The full version <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/641d2ad8-b122-42d5-9562-e6aec03ddb36\">is available here</a> and the full UAE VIP vaccine story <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd2e4aeb-e3df-48f1-b634-89ebf685a92c\">is here</a>.</p> <h2>How Greensill courted private equity months before its collapse</h2> <p>It was autumn 2020, and <strong>Greensill Capital</strong> was a ticking time bomb.&#xa0;</p> <p>The financial technology group's insurers had said they'd pull the cover that was critical to its business model, and Germany's financial watchdog <strong>BaFin</strong> was asking questions about its ties to metals magnate <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Yet, just months before its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db5bc46a-57cc-4c7d-a6fe-47f5a59412d4\">collapse</a>, it presented a far rosier picture to a line-up of private equity groups.&#xa0;</p> <p>Advised by blue-chip names <strong>Citigroup</strong>, <strong>Credit Suisse </strong>and <strong>Allen &amp; Overy</strong>, it launched what it called a “pre-IPO” funding round. It was trying to raise $1bn at a valuation of $7bn — twice the $3.5bn level at which <strong>SoftBank</strong> had invested the previous year.</p> <p>The buyout groups weren't impressed with what one described as “The Lex Show”, as Lex Greensill, the company's founder, regaled them with tales of his upbringing as the son of an Australian watermelon farmer.&#xa0;</p> <p>Read up on their reaction with <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/03f6649d-fdb6-4bfc-9ade-f970dfa1d7a0\">this </a>deep-dive by DD's Kaye Wiggins and Rob Smith.&#xa0;</p> <p>In other Greensill/private equity news, <strong>Apollo</strong>'s plan to buy parts of the business was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddb46251-eb70-407d-806e-e2f500e2957f\">crumbling</a> on Wednesday after the US technology company <strong>Taulia</strong>, which supplies the digital platform used by most of Greensill's customers, looked to move its users to <strong>JPMorgan</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Reminder: if you want to brush up on the long Greensill story, the FT's recent reporting is collected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6d578c4-9a57-4375-b7b2-c88d4b7cc21f\">here</a>, and you can watch DD's Rob Smith explaining it all on Australia's ABC News <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/programs/the-business/\">here</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Japanese insurer <strong>Tokio Marine</strong> said the insurance policies at the heart of the collapse <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18c1892b-1ad3-4ed5-8c8f-075522275490\">may not have been valid</a> in the first place, and <strong>Insurance Australia Group</strong> said it had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6699403b-6cfe-4cab-9fa6-7fa720e1f270\">no “net insurance exposure”</a> to policies sold to Greensill Capital.</p> <p>And for a glimpse into the real-world impact of the Greensill story, check out this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fedcf26c-4313-4649-b628-9a2884b3e43e\">deep-dive</a> from the FT's Sylvia Pfeifer, Oliver Barnes and Jamie Smyth on the industrial empire run by Sanjeev Gupta, who used Greensill as his main lender.</p> <p>It spans four continents and employs 35,000 people, and has now hired <strong>PJT Partners</strong> and <strong>Alvarez &amp; Marsal</strong> to help it secure new financing as it faces its greatest test yet.&#xa0;</p> <h2>McKinsey: a new era?</h2> <p>Sometimes life hands you a second chance. For <strong>Bob Sternfels</strong>, the magnitude of reputational crises shaking <strong>McKinsey</strong>, the consultancy where he has spent the past 25 years, was just enough to shift the odds <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0619e19-2696-4ed4-9538-7ce5c2b9357f\">in his favour</a>.</p> <p>The 51-year-old San Franciscan was expected to be the favourite in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1c2b112-bd7f-11e7-9836-b25f8adaa111\">secretive ballot</a> for the company's top job back in 2017. DD regulars will know how the story ended. Then-Asia Pacific chairman <strong>Kevin Sneader</strong> ultimately <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bbca832a-1b1c-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6\">inherited the crown</a>.</p> <p>But Sternfels was unexpectedly thrown into the mix once more when Sneader failed to qualify for the final round of voting by McKinsey's 650 senior partners.&#xa0;</p> <p>This week Sternfels, currently acting in a role akin to chief operating officer, beat out fellow finalist <strong>Sven Smit</strong>, the Amsterdam-based co-chair of McKinsey's research arm.</p> <p>It's a new chapter for McKinsey, but certainly not a blank slate.</p> <p>Over the past several years, the company's signature <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63f24181-aee0-49f4-9966-a447d79692f0?\">“mystique”</a> — which meant, among other things, that it was supposed to work only for the most reputable clients — has taken a few hits. Working with <strong>Purdue Pharma </strong>left a sizeable dent, for one.</p> <p>Will Sternfels try to get it back, or write his own script?</p> <p>Surely he's been around long enough to have seen what <em>not</em> to do, as he saw first hand former managing director <strong>Rajat Gupta</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a106408-b4cd-11e1-aa06-00144feabdc0\">imprisoned</a> for insider trading in 2012.</p> <p>Winning over McKinsey's senior partners is one thing. Keeping them happy will be a separate challenge. The role is “analogous to running a political party. There are a lot of backbenchers who don't like having a boss,” a former partner told the FT.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Austrian financier <strong>Alexander Schütz</strong>, who came under pressure earlier this year over communications with the boss of disgraced payments company <strong>Wirecard</strong>, is leaving <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong>'s supervisory board. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ce8e6b3-962a-48f7-a72f-4111fc877634\">More here</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Herbert Smith Freehills </strong>has appointed<strong> Rebecca Maslen-Stannage</strong> as its first female chair. She will remain in Sydney during her four-year term. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6487829f-5f99-4e1f-aaf3-26b892251bb9\">More here</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>The Biden administration is vetting prominent tech critic <strong>Lina Khan</strong> for a senior government role, most likely as commissioner of the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c297564c-85fc-4235-9444-895609c06c38\">More here</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Baby foodmaker <strong>Yumi</strong> has hired <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>partner<strong> Sarah-Marie Martin</strong> as its chief financial officer.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Debevoise &amp; Plimpton </strong>is opening a new San Francisco office later this year. <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/debevoise-announces-san-francisco-office-to-serve-west-coast-clients-301244650.html\">Five partners</a> will relocate to spearhead the new territory.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>An inconvenient truth </strong>Investors are piling record sums into sustainable investments. But many of these funds are simply “greenwashing” — environmental buzzword-laden rebrands of the same old strategies. (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74888921-368d-42e1-91cd-c3c8ce64a05e\">FT</a>)</p> <p><strong>Taxation without representation </strong>American tax policy is skewed in favour of whites, argues Emory University law professor Dorothy Brown. Its disparities could negate any progress made towards racial financial equality. (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-03-10/america-s-tax-code-leaves-black-people-behind-dorothy-brown?srnd=businessweek-v2&amp;sref=OziMsGoK\">BBG</a>)</p> <p><strong>Going Dutch </strong>The Netherlands feared that the UK's exit from the EU would bruise its economy. Yet Amsterdam is blooming into an unlikely financial contender in a resurgence reminiscent of Tulip Mania. And it has Brexit to thank.
