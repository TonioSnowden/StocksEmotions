  "text": "<p>The BBC's chair has warned UK government ministers against squeezing its funding, saying the corporation had made considerable savings and further cuts risked “serious consequences”.</p> <p>Speaking in the middle of talks that the public sector broadcaster is holding with the government over its five-year financial settlement, Richard Sharp argued the BBC delivered “remarkable” value for money.</p> <p>Ministers have been resisting calls from the BBC for the licence fee to keep pace with inflation, said people with knowledge of the matter. Nadine Dorries, who replaced Oliver Dowden as culture secretary on Wednesday, is set to play a leading role in negotiations for the government.</p> <p>Sharp made the comments at a Royal Television Society conference in Cambridge as BBC News confirmed it had pressed ahead with the appointment of an editor, in spite of a row over impartiality.</p> <p>Jess Brammar, former deputy editor of Newsnight, is to become executive news editor to oversee the corporation's news channels. Sir Robbie Gibb, who sits on the BBC's board, had expressed disapproval of her candidacy.</p> <p>In a memo to staff announcing the appointment, the corporation's outgoing head of news Fran Unsworth wrote: “It is extremely disappointing that anyone should receive public and personal criticism . . . simply for applying for a job at the BBC.”</p> <p>She added: “BBC News has to be impartial and independent. BBC journalists are hired from a variety of different backgrounds, but while working at the BBC, they leave any personal opinions at the door.”</p> <p>The BBC added that Brammar's appointment was made in “fair and open competition”.</p> <p>Sharp's comments on funding are the latest sign that the former Goldman Sachs partner, who became BBC chair earlier this year, is pushing for a generous settlement with the government.</p> <p>Before his appointment, BBC executives had feared an arch critic would be installed, hamstringing it in the talks with the government. Tim Davie, BBC director-general, leads the negotiations on behalf of the corporation.</p> <p>Sharp said managers at the BBC, which is seeking to make almost £1bn in savings by next March, had “taken enormous cost out” already. “The low hanging fruit has gone,” he said. The BBC's operating and restructuring costs in the 2021-22 financial year are budgeted at about £5.5bn.</p> <p>Costs in the media industry were outpacing regular inflation, Sharp said, adding: “There would be serious consequences for a poorly funded BBC.”</p> <p>The licence fee is £159 a year and one is required to watch live TV on any channel or any BBC programmes on iPlayer, the corporation's on-demand service.</p> <p>Sharp, who was previously chancellor Rishi Sunak's boss at Goldman Sachs, said the fee was equivalent to 43p per household per day and compared the price favourably with newspapers.</p> <p>The corporation “played an important role in fighting media poverty”, he added. “One of the things that I find most remarkable is the price.”</p> <p>“There needs to be a national utility that delivers insight, education, children's and these other assets at a price point that people can afford,” he added. “We can do so because it's imposed.”</p> <p>“I happen to think it's a good thing. And then the question is, does the government believe that too?”</p> <p>Also at the conference, media minister John Whittingdale said the government was introducing measures to promote British content on TV.</p> <p>He said the government would include proposals to require the UK's public service broadcasters — the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 — to produce “distinctively British” content that allows “people in every corner of the UK to see their lives reflected on screen, and that showcase the things we are most proud of to the rest of the world”. At present, they are required to broadcast “original” content.</p> <p>He also said the government was pressing ahead with legislation to ensure content from the UK public service broadcasters was “discoverable” on smart TVs, set-top boxes, streaming sticks and other platforms.</p><p>Source: Alistair Gray in Cambridge 2021 'BBC chair warns further budget cuts risk ‘serious consequences'' FT.com 15 September.
