Auto, housing and medical insurance factors suggest year-on-year core consumer-price index inflation hitting in the mid-5% range in the first quarter of 2022, 4% next June and 3.1% at the end of next year, according to the economists. That will leave CPI running at a hotter pace relative to the personal consumption expenditures price index, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge. The Goldman economists see that measure reaching 4.3% at the close of this year, 3% next June and 2.15% at the end of 2022. \"Fed officials look at many measures, and it increasingly appears that the full set of inflation data will look quite hot on a year-on-year basis around the middle of next year when tapering ends,\" the economists said, referring to the widely expected reduction of the central bank's bond-buying stimulus program, now running at $120 billion a month. \"As we noted recently, this increases the risk of an earlier hike in 2022\" to interest rates, the economists added.</p><p>—Michael S. Derby</p><p>Commentary</p><p>Fed Tapering Won't Beat Inflation</p><p>Monetary-policy normalization is a good thing, but tapering isn't a panacea for surging prices, because supply-chain problems out of the central bank's control are contributing to price increases, Alexander William Salter writes.</p><p>Mr. Salter is an associate professor of economics in the Rawls College of Business at Texas Tech University and a senior fellow with the Sound Money Project.</p><p>America Has Supply-Side Problems</p><p>A better fourth-quarter GDP report won't mean that bottlenecks are finished holding the economy back, Justin Lahart writes, noting that semiconductor shortages, in particular, look as if they are going to persist into next year.</p><p>Global Chip Shortage ‘Is Far From Over' as Wait Times Get Longer</p><p>Basis Points</p><p>Eurozone business and household confidence rose in October, reflected in the European Commission's economic sentiment indicator, an aggregate measure of business and consumer confidence, increasing from 117.8 in September to 118.6. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected the index to come in at 116.6. (Dow Jones Newswires)</p><p>The number of houses going under contract in the U.S. declined in September after rising sharply in August, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Its Pending Home Sales Index, a forward-looking indicator of home sales based on contract signings, fell by 2.3% in September from August and by 8% from a year earlier to 116.7. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected the indicator to increase by 1% on month. (DJN)</p><p>Factory activity in the central U.S. gained momentum, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, whose Tenth District Manufacturing survey's composite index rose from 22 in September to 31, beating the 23.5 forecast by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. (DJN)</p><p>U.S. mortgage rates have climbed to their highest level since early April, with the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaging 3.14% for the week ending Oct. 28, up five basis points from the previous week, and the 15-year fixed-rate mortgage up four basis points to an average of 2.37%, according to Freddie Mac. (MarketWatch)</p><p>South Korea's inflation is expected to have reached a near decade high in October, likely topping the 3% mark for the first time since early 2012. The median forecast from five economists polled by The Wall Street Journal is for a 3.3% on-year rise in the CPI, versus a 2.5% gain in September. The projected price growth is way above the central bank's 2% target. (DJN)</p>",
