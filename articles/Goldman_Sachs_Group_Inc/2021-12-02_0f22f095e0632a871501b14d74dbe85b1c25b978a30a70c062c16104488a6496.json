  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs has said its asset management business will vote against big companies that do not have a minimum number of female and minority board members from next year, in a decision that could affect thousands of companies.</p> <p>Beginning in March 2022, Goldman Sachs Asset Management will require companies globally to have at least two women on any board with more than 10 directors. Its policy at present requires one female director. </p> <p>For S&amp;P 500 and FTSE 100 companies, GSAM will also require at least one director to be from an under-represented minority group.</p> <p>For companies that do not comply, GSAM will vote against members of the board's nominating committees. In the US, it will vote against all board members if the company has no female directors. </p> <p>The tougher standards could affect about 2,500 companies worldwide if they take no action to add women to their boards by March, GSAM said. Twelve S&amp;P 500 companies at present do not meet the requirement to have one minority board member, it said.</p> <p>With its new voting policy, GSAM joins other asset managers and countries in pushing companies to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf8b3278-5137-4163-bbbe-186d8d4a2193\">rid themselves of all-male boards</a>.</p> <p>RBC Global Asset Management said last year that it would vote against all members of the nominating or governance committees at the annual meetings of businesses where women did not make up a quarter of the board. </p> <p>France and Germany have established quotas for women on boards. Stock exchange Nasdaq is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37f19ed5-148d-492a-a966-999ba1460fca\">bringing in requirements</a> for its listed companies to have two diverse directors, including one female and one under-represented minority.</p> <p>GSAM, which manages more than $2tn of assets, is pushing for board diversity because it believes this will benefit shareholders, said Katie Koch, co-head of the fundamental equity business. </p> <p>“We believe diverse teams outperform,” she said. “[Diversity] is a very powerful tool for unlocking shareholder value.”</p> <p>As of the third quarter of this year, 26.1 per cent of Russell 3000 directors were women, up from 25.2 per cent in the second quarter, <a href=\"https://www.equilar.com/reports/87-q3-2021-equilar-gender-diversity-index\">according to Equilar</a>, a consultancy. It said 96 Russell 3000 boards had no women, the first time there had been fewer than 100.</p> <p>In January 2020, David Solomon, Goldman Sachs' chief executive, said the group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a301780-3dfb-11ea-a01a-bae547046735\">would not take</a> a US or European company public unless the company had at least one diverse board member.</p><p>Source: Patrick Temple-West in New York 2021 'Goldman asset management arm takes tough stance on companies' board diversity' FT.com 2 December.
