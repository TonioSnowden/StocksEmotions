  "text": "<p>“BBB [Build Back Better] enactment had already looked like a close call and in light of Manchin's comments we are adjusting our forecast to remove the assumption that BBB will become law,” said a team led by chief U.S. economist Jan Hatzius.</p><p>Manchin told “Fox News Sunday” that, after&#xa0;5½ months of intraparty talks, he couldn't “vote to continue with this piece of legislation. I just can't. I've tried everything humanly possible. I can't get there.”</p><p>His vote is crucial in a 50-50 split Senate, assuming Democrats and Republicans vote as blocs and the two independents vote with the Democrats.</p><p>“We had already expected a&#xa0;negative fiscal impulse&#xa0;for 2022 as a result of the fading support from COVID-relief legislation enacted in 2020 and 2021, and without BBB enactment, this fiscal impulse will become somewhat more negative than we had expected,” said Hatzius and the team.</p><p>Specifically, they said the expiration of the child tax credit and the lack of the other new spending that had been expected are behind the hits to its growth forecast, which was cut to 2% from 3% for the first quarter of 2022, to 3% from 3.5% for the second, and to 2.75% from 3% in the third quarter.</p><p>“While BBB in its current form looks unlikely, there is still a good chance that Congress enacts a much smaller set of fiscal proposals dealing with manufacturing incentives and supply-chain issues,” said the economists. “There is also still a chance that Congress retroactively extends the expanded child tax credit, with some modifications, though we think the odds of this occurring are less than even.”</p><p>See:Biden's social-spending bill ‘not dead yet' as Joe Manchin could back parts of it, analysts say</p><p>Manchin's rejection of the bill was helping drive losses for perceived riskier assets, with global stocks falling alongside oil CL00 prices. Political concerns piled on top of worries over increasing COVID infections due to the omicron coronavirus variant.</p><p>Coronavirus Update:Data suggest boosters are essential to avoid omicron infection, and Fauci says best way to protect kids is make sure adults are vaccinated</p><p>Goldman economists had previously lowered their U.S. growth forecasts for 2021 and 2022 in October due to fears over a slow consumer-spending recovery.</p>",
