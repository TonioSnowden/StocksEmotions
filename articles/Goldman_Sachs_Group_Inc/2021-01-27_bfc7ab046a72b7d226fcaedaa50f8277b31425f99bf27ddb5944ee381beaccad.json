  "text": "<p>A strong series of earnings from major tech companies overnight will do little to dim the enthusiasm of<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38ee2e14-8b0a-48aa-9525-520992c08375\"> the runaway markets</a> we are currently experiencing.</p> <p>A pandemic trifecta of a boom in PC sales, surging demand for video gaming and increased usage of <strong>Microsoft'</strong>s cloud services won the Windows and Xbox maker a 17 per cent surge in revenues, to $43.1bn in the final quarter of 2020. </p> <p>Microsoft also pointed to signs of a return to more normal IT buying patterns after nearly a year of crisis spending, in which customers turned away from longer-term projects to focus on the emergency purchases to keep their workers connected and businesses ticking, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/720ba9e9-8cea-4583-b26e-d98a74c4db21\">reports Richard Waters</a>.</p> <p>It predicted another quarter of 17 per cent growth, beating the 11 per cent Wall Street had been forecasting. Its shares hit an all-time high on the news.</p> <p>Chipmaker<strong> Advanced Micro Devices</strong> reported revenues rose 53 per cent to $3.2bn in the fourth quarter, beating analysts' forecasts of $3.0bn. Chief executive Lisa Su said: “All of our businesses are firing on all cylinders,” with its processors being used in PCs, cloud servers and the latest generation of games consoles from Microsoft and Sony.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Texas Instruments</strong> reported “a strong [December] quarter driven by strong demand in automotive, industrial and personal electronics” for its semiconductors. It beat Wall Street expectations with a bullish forecast for the current quarter. </p> <p>After the closing bell in New York this evening, <strong>Facebook, Apple</strong> and <strong>Tesla</strong> will be reporting. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3920a716-2f55-484c-9741-75f9798918cf\">Patrick McGee says </a>Apple is expected to post its first-ever $100bn-revenue quarter, assuming iPhone sales will have grown 6 per cent on a year earlier.</p> <p>As part of our Runaway Markets series, we look today at how <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0158a15b-52e7-4270-9ab3-4f6934b931c3\">Wall Street is divided </a>between those&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/06be766d-6f13-405f-8772-dab96a797864\">warning of a “bubble”</a>&#xa0;and those re-evaluating traditional assumptions about how best to value a business.

JPMorgan plans UK digital bank this year</strong><br>Goldman Sachs was first with its Marcus online-only bank launch in the UK in 2018, but JPMorgan is now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90d9be53-d8d2-478b-8740-4ce0a3f23b05\">following suit with its Chase brand.</a> While Marcus confined itself to savings accounts, Chase promises a “new take on current accounts”. Meanwhile, Jemima Kelly has been looking at<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e85a5922-517f-4fcc-959c-be8703701c9f\"> Revolut's attempt </a>at becoming a bank and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5209685c-aa8e-4f33-92d0-81f9c7a29b3c\">deputy governor of the People's Bank of China </a>writes for us on fintech risk and regulation.</p> <p><strong>2. Chinese tech's foreign retrenchment</strong><br>Ant Group, Alibaba's digital payments arm, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75e9673a-1329-45b6-b76f-d40ceb1c1b0b\">planning to sell EyeVerify</a>, the US-based biometric security firm it bought in 2016, amid heightened tensions between Beijing and Washington. TikTok has announced it will<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb139f26-7a14-497d-8e5a-b5e023a0f083\"> lay off hundreds</a> of workers in India after its efforts to restore its banned app there failed. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0aee2e6c-3083-4d5b-a9d0-ea3ab2b7a35c\">Richard Milne comments </a>on why Sweden's Ericsson chose to square up to its own government to support its rival Huawei</p> <p><strong>3.

At $2,500, <a href=\"https://www.sony.com/electronics/professional-smartphones/xperia-pro\">the Xperia PRO</a> is certainly beyond ordinary consumers' budgets and Sony is pushing its 5G and HDMI connectivity as a way for it to be used as an external monitor for cameras, with footage able to be streamed or filed rapidly over the mobile network. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22248440/sony-xperia-pro-5g-price-release-date-news-features\">The Verge reports</a> it launches in the US today, but there are no plans for a European debut.</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Tech's roaring 2020' FT.com 27 January.
