  "text": "<p>After blockbuster gains in 2020, this year has so far proved difficult for many hedge funds betting on and against stocks for fundamental reasons. Losses from the meme-stock rally in January have weighed on funds, as have sector rotations and macroeconomic concerns about inflation and Covid-19 that fund managers say have outweighed individual companies' fundamentals.</p><p>Stock-picking hedge funds were up an average 8.9% for the year through November, according to a recent client note from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., compared with a total return of the S&amp;P 500 of 26%. December's volatility has added to many funds' losses, investors say. The S&amp;P 500, including dividends, was essentially flat for December through Monday.</p><p>D1 is one of the most prominent hedge funds investing in both public and private companies—one share class it offers to investors lets D1 invest up to 99% of their money in private companies—and manages $25 billion across both its public and private investments. Mr. Sundheim wrote D1 would be opening to more money from existing investors in January for share classes that invest in public markets.</p><p>\"While there are currently many macroeconomic cross currents—including the Omicron variant, inflation, and central bank monetary policy changes—we view the current market volatility as driven primarily by factor rotation and not changes in the intrinsic value of our equities,\" Mr. Sundheim wrote. \"Stock moves like we have seen are an opportunity to add to our highest conviction names at attractive prices.\"</p><p>D1 plans to raise more money for some share classes investing in both public and private companies in April, the letter said. Investments in private companies have significantly boosted the returns of hedge funds that invest in both public and private companies, including D1.</p><p>Previously Viking Global's chief investment officer before starting D1 in 2018, Mr. Sundheim said D1 had experienced significant losses before, such as in March 2020 during Covid-19's first wave, and in January 2021 due to the meme-stock rally. D1 historically had rebounded from its losses over the next six months, he wrote.</p><p>D1 for the year through November was up 17% in the share class that can invest up to 35% of client money in private companies, said a person familiar with the firm.</p><p>Write to Juliet Chung at juliet.chung@wsj.com</p><p>Hedge Fund D1 Capital's Public Bets Fall 12% in December; Founder Sees Buying Opportunity</p>",
