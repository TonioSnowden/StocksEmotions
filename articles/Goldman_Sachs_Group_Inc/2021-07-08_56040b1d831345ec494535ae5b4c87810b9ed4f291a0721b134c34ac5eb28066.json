  "text": "<p>It has partnered with mall owner Simon Property Group Inc. on the acquisition of some brands, including Aeropostale, Forever 21 and Penney, making it one of the bigger operators of physical stores at a time when more shopping is shifting online.</p><p>Authentic Brands had net income of $225 million in 2020 on total revenue of $489 million, according to the SEC filing. The preliminary prospectus filed Tuesday doesn't set an initial public offering price or place a valuation on the business.
