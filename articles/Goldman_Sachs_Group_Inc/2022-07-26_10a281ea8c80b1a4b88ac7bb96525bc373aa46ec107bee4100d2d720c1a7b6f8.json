  "title": "World News:  China's Covid Policy Slows Vaccines  ----  By Chun Han Wong",
  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- China's sluggish progress in vaccinating the elderly and vulnerable against Covid-19 is impeding any departure from the cycles of mass testing and lockdowns that are hobbling the world's second-largest economy. </p><p>   While the government stepped up efforts to raise inoculation rates in recent months, tens of millions of Chinese over 60 remain entirely unvaccinated against Covid-19, and many more have yet to take booster shots needed to protect against the Omicron subvariants now fueling outbreaks. </p><p>   Officials have tried to overcome skepticism and inertia against vaccination, particularly among the elderly, by revealing that top Chinese leaders have taken domestically developed shots and lashing out at what they called irresponsible rumors alleging serious side effects from vaccines. </p><p>   As of July 22, nearly 90% of China's 1.4 billion people had received at least two vaccine doses, government data released Saturday show. A similar percentage of people age 60 and older have received at least one dose, which suggests more than 27 million people from that group are completely unvaccinated. Take-up of booster shots is far lower, with roughly 57% of the population and 67% of over 60s having received such doses. </p><p>   More than a quarter of people over 80 -- who are most at risk of severe illness and death from an infection -- have yet to take any doses, while more than 60% of them haven't received booster shots, government data show. </p><p>   Such figures represent a crucial weakness in China's Covid-19 strategy, given its reliance on homegrown vaccines made with more traditional technologies, which experts say require at least three doses to adequately protect against severe illness and death. They also impede Beijing's efforts to transition from its \"dynamic zero-Covid\" policy, which relies on strict lockdowns and mass health screenings to contain outbreaks -- an approach manifested most dramatically in the two-month shutdown of Shanghai earlier this year. </p><p>   The pace of vaccination has also declined in recent months. Daily totals of administered doses have slipped well below one million by June, down from a 2022 peak of more than eight million doses in early January, government data show. </p><p>   Progress \"is rather slow but it's also understandable,\" said Yanzhong Huang, a health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. \"It will be very difficult to significantly improve vaccination rates, as vaccine skepticism becomes a bigger problem in trying to reach the 'last mile,' \" among people who are most resistant to getting jabbed, he said. </p><p>   Chinese leader Xi Jinping has reiterated his commitment to a dynamic-zero strategy, while urging officials to adopt a precise approach in conducting containment measures, to reduce the damage to the economy. </p><p>   The potential pain from China's containment measures was made clear by Shanghai's lockdown that closed businesses and hit consumer spending during much of the second quarter, when the city's economic output shrank almost 14% from a year earlier. </p><p>   China recorded on Sunday the lowest one-day total of new locally transmitted Covid cases in more than a week, with more than eight in 10 of the 641 infections in two of the country's less-developed regions, National Health Commission data released Monday show. Still, the number of districts deemed high- or medium-risk has risen nationwide, with affected areas accounting for more than one-fifth of gross domestic product, according to an estimate Monday by Goldman Sachs Group analysts. </p><p>   China's history of vaccine scandals, as well as a lack of data on the safety and effectiveness of Chinese vaccines on elderly recipients, put many people off taking doses. Official vaccination guidelines have urged caution for people with acute bouts of chronic disease. The relative success of Mr. Xi's zero-tolerance strategy -- which Beijing portrayed as a point of national pride in contrast with large infection waves in other countries -- hasn't helped either, as many ordinary Chinese feel less compelled to get vaccinated because of the low risks of contracting Covid-19. </p><p>   \"I don't think a vaccine mandate can be justified in a location pursuing dynamic zero Covid,\" said Ben Cowling, chair professor of epidemiology at the University of Hong Kong's School of Public Health. \"The harms of rare side effects would likely exceed the expected benefits of vaccination in such a scenario.\" </p><p>   Such perceptions flared into public anger in early July, when Beijing municipal authorities announced plans to impose a vaccine mandate that would have blocked unvaccinated people from entering public venues such as cinemas and gyms. The program was swiftly halted in the face of online anger decrying the plan as an excessive intrusion into people's lives and questioning the effectiveness of vaccines. </p><p>   Mr. Xi has warned that China, with its vast population, would suffer what he said were unimaginable consequences if it tried to rely on herd immunity to beat Covid-19. \"Even if there is some temporary impact on the economy, we will not put people's lives and health in harm's way, and we must protect the elderly and the children in particular,\" he said during a June visit to the central city of Wuhan, the original epicenter of the pandemic. </p><p>   Such a high-profile commitment to zero-Covid makes it hard for local authorities to try more aggressive methods to increase vaccination rates, Mr. Huang said. \"There's no room for local leaders to maneuver.\" </p><p></p>",
