Yet many of the fiscal problems that drove Puerto Rico's decline haven't been fixed.</p><p>\"This period of financial crisis is coming to an end.\"</p><p>— Natalie Jaresko, executive director of Puerto Rico's financial oversight board</p><p>Hong Kong cruise line faces debt restructuring.

The top lender of the bankrupt establishment challenged its chapter 11 exit plan, asserting the restructuring framework wasn't proposed in good faith and would unfairly benefit the hotel's insiders. In court papers, Benefit Street Partners LLC said the hotel's owners have improperly diverted revenues, occupancy taxes and other funds, while forcing the lender to wait years longer for repayment than it had agreed to. The judge presiding over the chapter 11 case is set to hold a trial on the proposed restructuring next month.</p><p>New York developer All Year strikes deal with investor. The proposed settlement filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan would resolve claims by investor Gary Katz and his Downtown Capital Partners that bankrupt developer All Year Holdings Ltd. owed him as much as $100 million on preferred equity instruments he holds. All Year has said it owes Mr. Katz about $57 million but agreed in the compromise to transfer managerial control of a corporate affiliate to him, easing the sale of eight apartment buildings in Brooklyn over a period of five years.</p><p>All Year, owned by developer Yoel Goldman, filed for chapter 11 last month to protect itself from potential litigation in the U.S. and Israel while continuing negotiations with creditors owed nearly $1.6 billion in debt.
