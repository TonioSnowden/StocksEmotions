  "title": "Garcia's Take: ECP Could Benefit From European Partner; U.S. energy-infrastructure specialist has held talks over a potential investment from Bridgepoint Group",
  "text": "<p>The talks with Energy Capital Partners, also known as ECP, were at an early stage, Bridgepoint added.</p><p>ECP is an energy infrastructure-focused investor backing businesses such as power operators, renewable-energy developers and providers of energy-efficiency services. Contrary to the reports, the two firms didn't discuss potential deal prices during their conversations, two people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Europe's clean-energy drive attracted U.S. energy-focused investment firms, including Quantum Energy Partners and Riverstone Holdings, long before Russia's invasion of Ukraine curtailed the region's supply of cheap natural gas and sent local energy prices soaring.</p><p>Since the invasion, investment opportunities in Europe's energy-infrastructure sector have expanded as the region struggles to find alternatives to Russia's gas, according to asset managers.</p><p>\"With a sudden interruption of that cheap and abundant supply, Europe finds itself ill-equipped to make a fast and easy transition to other energy sources,\" Michele Della Vigna, head of natural resources research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s research group in Europe, said in a recent report.</p><p>The world will need $1 trillion in additional annual energy investments over the next five years to ensure energy is available and affordable, he added.</p><p>ECP doesn't have offices in Europe, though it has backed at least three investments there. In September, publicly traded Biffa PLC, a waste-management company in England, said it agreed to be acquired for 1.3 billion pounds, equivalent to $1.55 billion, by a new company controlled by ECP.</p><p>A potential combination with Bridgepoint would give ECP access to the firm's presence across the region. Bridgepoint has offices in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, Madrid and Paris.</p><p>ECP's medium size—it has raised $26 billion in capital commitments since it was formed in 2005—and experience with energy infrastructure makes it a potentially attractive target for larger asset managers, many of which are seeking to capitalize on a global shift to clean energy.</p><p>Private-equity firms, however, have other ways to expand in Europe, including joint ventures with local investors. ECP could also choose that route.</p><p>In any case, ECP appears to see a benefit in expanding beyond North America. Whether it does so with Bridgepoint or another firm remains to be seen.</p><p>Write to Luis Garcia at luis.garcia@wsj.com</p>",
