  "title": "New York's Tax Madness",
  "text": "<p>Since New York City has its own income tax, running to 3.88%, the combined rate would be 15.73%. That's a bigger bite than even California's notorious 13.3% top tax, and don't forget Uncle Sam's 37% share. Pretty soon living in a low-tax state looks inviting. Keep in mind that New York's income tax is already progressive: The top 5% of filers contribute more than 60% of the revenue, the Journal reports.</p><p>-- Capital-gains taxes: Put a 1% surtax on investment gains by people earning $1 million a year. That percentage might sound small, but New York already taxes capital gains as regular income. So start with the Assembly's new top marginal rate of 15.73% for a Manhattanite. Add the 1% surtax. The top federal rate on cap gains is 23.8%. The grand total would be 40.53%, and that's before Joe Biden's campaign promise to tax capital gains federally as regular income. What a thanks for investing to create jobs in the city.</p><p>-- Estate taxes: Raise the top rate to 20%, from today's 16%, for taxable estates above $10.1 million. Remember this is stacked atop the federal estate tax of 40%, meaning the government's marginal take would reach 60%. Is it any wonder that wealthy people spend big bucks hiring estate lawyers?</p><p>-- Pied-a-terre tax: Put a levy on \"high-value\" second homes in New York City. Rates on \"family residences of one to three units,\" the Assembly said, would run from 0.3% to 4% of the value over $5 million. For condos and co-ops, it'd be 10% to 13.5% of the value over $300,000.</p><p>Such proposals would harm New York. Consider a letter signed last month by 250 business leaders. \"As committed New Yorkers and employers of more than 1.5 million residents,\" they expressed \"alarm at plans to enact the largest spending and tax increases in the state's history.\"</p><p>The letter's signatories include leaders from Bank of America, Pfizer, ViacomCBS, JPMorgan Chase, Nasdaq, Bloomberg, JetBlue, WeWork, Mastercard, Goldman Sachs and Revlon. (Another is Robert Thomson, the CEO of News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal.) They say the pandemic revealed that their workforces are \"more mobile than we ever imagined.\"</p><p>Right now \"only about 10% of our colleagues are in the office,\" and \"the proposed tax increases will make it harder to get them to return.\" Instead, companies might feel pulled toward places their staffs want to live: \"This is what happened to New York during the 1970s, when we lost half our Fortune 500 companies, and it took thirty years to recover.\"</p><p>The squeeze is worse when you add the new taxes President Biden wants. A second factor: In 2017 the federal deduction for state and local taxes was capped at $10,000, so New Yorkers will now really feel the pinch. As E.J. McMahon of the Empire Center for Public Policy writes: \"The financial incentive for high earners to move themselves and their businesses from New York to states with low or no income taxes has never -- ever -- been higher than it already is.\"</p><p>The final budget probably won't go as far as the Assembly's wish list. On Sunday the Journal said legislators had been briefed on a possible deal to raise the top rate on personal income to 10.9%. That's lower than the suggested 11.85%, but throw in the city's 3.88%, and it's still higher than California. This is hardly the kind of \"compromise\" that will revive New York.</p>",
