  "text": "<p>Major financial firms are set to kick off a bumper week of earnings reports Monday. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are set to give updates ahead of the opening bell. Charles Schwab and IBM will report later in the day. Companies due to provide updates later this week include Johnson &amp; Johnson on Tuesday, Tesla on Wednesday and Twitter on Friday.</p><p>Investors are trying to reconcile a dire economic outlook with still relatively positive earnings forecasts. Economic growth is showing signs of slowing while inflation is soaring, last week reaching a fresh four-decade high. Meanwhile, central banks are raising interest rates rapidly, adding another cloud on the economy's horizon. So far, corporate reports have been lackluster.</p><p>\"It feels like something is wrong: Either the economic story is wrong or analysts are being too optimistic on earnings, and it feels like the latter,\" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street Global Advisors. \"If you scrape the text of company earnings announcements, many are complaining.\"</p><p>Data due Monday are expected to show declining confidence among U.S. home builders as mortgage rates are rising. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the National Association of Home Builders to report a seventh consecutive month of declining confidence in July.</p><p>The European Central Bank is expected to raise interest rates for the first time in 11 years at a meeting Thursday. The region's economy is feeling the effects of the war in Ukraine and an energy crisis more acutely than other economies. The Bank of Japan is expected to buck the trend among global central banks and keep rates unchanged on Thursday.</p><p>The Federal Reserve has signaled it will raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point for the second time in a row later this month.</p><p>Commodity prices rebounded following a stretch of weakness. Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 2.9% to $104.05 a barrel. Copper prices in London rose 2.9% to $7,384.50 a metric ton. Gold prices rose 0.8%.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.950% from 2.929% on Friday.</p><p>Overseas, global markets were higher across the board. In Europe, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.2%. Oil-and-gas and mining stocks led the gains as commodity prices rose. Commodity trader and miner Glencore rose nearly 4% while oil major Shell gained 3.7%.</p><p>In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index jumped 2.5% while in mainland China, the Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.6%. Markets in Japan were closed for a holiday.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Rise as Investors Await Bank Earnings</p>",
