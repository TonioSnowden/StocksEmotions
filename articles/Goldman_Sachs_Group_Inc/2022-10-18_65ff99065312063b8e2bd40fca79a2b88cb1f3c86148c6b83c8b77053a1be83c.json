  "title": "Goldman Sachs Reports 43% Profit Drop, Confirms Reshuffling; Investment banking revenue declined 57% in the third quarter from year earlier",
  "text": "<p>Revenue was down 12% to $11.98 billion. That beat the $11.42 billion expected by analysts.</p><p>Goldman also confirmed a broad reshuffling in how it is organized, one of the biggest overhauls in the firm's history. The Wall Street Journal reported on the bank's plans on Sunday. Notably, Goldman will combine its signature investment-banking and trading businesses into one unit, while merging asset and wealth management into another.</p><p>The move reflects Chief Executive David Solomon's effort to shift Goldman's focus away from the high-risk, high-reward Wall Street units that have long defined it, and toward businessesthat generate steady fees no matter the environment.</p><p>Mr. Solomon said in a statement that the new structure would strengthen the bank's core businesses, diversify its products and services, and allow it to \"operate more efficiently as we drive higher, more durable returns.\"</p><p>Investment banking and trading have long been Goldman's power centers, and those units generate huge profits in times when markets reward risk-taking. However, investors place less value on profits from those businesses because they can swing so wildly. A greater emphasis on units such as asset management and wealth management could eventually boost Goldman's valuation, which has fallen behind rivals.</p><p>In the third quarter, Goldman's investment banking revenue fell 57% to $1.58 billion, following similar declines at the other banks. Head-snapping volatility in the markets and the uncertain economic outlook have kept many corporate deal makers on the sidelines. A measure of CEO confidence fell to the lowest level since the 2008 financial crisis, the Conference Board said last week.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think the next quarter has in store for Goldman Sachs? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Goldman's results cap a mixed quarter for big U.S. banks. Profit fell at all six major banks, including a 29% decline at Morgan Stanley and a 25% drop at Citigroup Inc. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Citigroup, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Bank of America Corp. set aside a combined nearly $2 billion to cover possible bad loans, a sign that executives are worried about a possible recession. A year ago, the banks were releasing money from their rainy-day reserves.</p><p>Still, revenue rose at most of the banks, and the majority topped analyst expectations. Their results confirmed that individuals and businesses are still borrowing at a healthy rate, and consumers have increased their spending on credit cards, including on more discretionary items such as travel and leisure.</p><p>Write to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com</p><p>Goldman Sachs Reports 43% Profit Drop, Confirms Reshuffling</p>",
