  "title": "Talen Energy to Hand Power-Plant Business to Bondholders; The company placed power-generation facilities in bankruptcy after last year's natural-gas rally caused a cash crunch",
  "text": "<p>Secured creditors owed nearly $2.9 billion are expected to be fully paid under the proposed agreement. Talen, which expects to complete its debt restructuring in roughly six months, has landed a $1.76 billion loan to carry it through the chapter 11 process, funded by Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>The business said it faced \"immediate and significant liquidity concerns that can be traced back to the sudden and sustained rise of natural-gas prices\" last year. Talen had to post collateral on its energy hedges as gas prices rose, \"resulting in an expected squeeze on available cash,\" according to papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston.</p><p>Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com</p>",
