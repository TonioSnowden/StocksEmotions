  "text": "<p>Germany's foreign intelligence service last year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ba4eedc-992e-4e64-9bb1-9d81b379ea00\">shunned an offer to meet former Wirecard executive Jan Marsalek in Moscow</a>, fearing that the invitation to talk to the fugitive was a trap set up by Russia's FSB spy agency, people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times.</p> <p>German criminal prosecutors accuse Marsalek, Wirecard's former second-in-command, of being a central culprit in the €3.2bn fraud that shocked the country's political and financial establishment. </p> <p>Long hailed as one of Germany's few tech success stories, the digital payments company collapsed into insolvency in June 2020 shortly after disclosing that half of its revenue and €1.9bn in corporate cash did not exist. </p> <p>The meeting of Marsalek with Germany's BND spy agency was proposed in March 2021 by a businessman, according to people briefed on the matter. But the idea was rejected by senior BND staff in Berlin, who believed that the businessman might be an informal associate of the FSB.</p> <p><em>Thanks for all your comments on inflation.

South Korea and Singapore tighten monetary policy</strong> Policymakers at central banks in Singapore and South Korea have become the latest to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5a075e6-ee74-4cba-aeef-c40163e5f5bd\">tighten monetary policy</a> as the war in Ukraine stokes global inflation. Figures this week showed inflation in the UK and US at multi-decade highs, putting pressure on policymakers in those countries to accelerate interest rate rises while avoiding <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02f7513a-6fe6-461d-9058-69a7fe7a3eec\">a “hard landing”</a> for their economies.</p> <p><strong>2.

The additional checks were introduced by Abbott last week. They added hours to usual crossing times and led to long backlogs. </p> <p><strong>3. Amazon hits US sellers with surcharge</strong> Amazon is adding <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f955720e-ffe8-4770-8677-832950f2ab4c\">a 5 per cent surcharge to its delivery fees</a> in response to rising fuel costs and inflation, the company told its third-party sellers yesterday. The fee will be added to the per-unit delivery cost, not the overall product price, it said.</p> <p><strong>4. China escalates zero-Covid propaganda</strong> China's official Xinhua news agency published an article today warning that the country's medical system <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a956cf4b-82a8-4857-a957-0270d41f503d\">risked “breaking down”</a> in the event of a mass Covid outbreak. It follows comments from President Xi Jinping who yesterday called on citizens to “overcome complacency” in “response to the virus's mutation”.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>5. New York City subway attack suspect arrested </strong>The suspect in a New York City subway shooting that left 10 people wounded and traumatised was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4fadaea9-f240-4ad4-b646-192316ab90ed\">arrested by police</a> and charged in federal court. Frank James, 62, was apprehended without incident after a tip from a citizen, police said.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Bank earnings</strong> Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley are the latest banks to report earnings. Their investment banking segments are expected to have taken a hit, like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2eb49e29-dbf8-4d5f-be40-94915ae5e6d0\">JPMorgan's</a>, owing to a slowdown in global dealmaking. Regional consumer bank PNC also reports earnings this morning.</p> <p><strong>Economic data</strong> US retail sales are expected to have increased 0.6 per cent in March, up from a 0.3 per cent gain in February. Sales in the so-called control group, which excludes autos, gasoline, building materials and food services, is forecast to have jumped 1 per cent in March. New applications for unemployment aid are estimated to have edged up to 171,000 in the week ended April 9 and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index is forecast to decline slightly to 59 in April from 59.4 last month.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Monetary policy</strong> Cleveland Federal Reserve president Loretta Mester will discuss workforce development at the Ohio Economic Forum hosted by the University of Akron College of Business.
