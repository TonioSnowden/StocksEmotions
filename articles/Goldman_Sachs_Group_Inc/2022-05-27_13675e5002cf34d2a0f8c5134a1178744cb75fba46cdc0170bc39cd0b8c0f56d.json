  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start</strong>: EY <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/975214e6-a330-418d-9daf-f5b41b1847f7\">is working on a split</a> of its audit and advisory operations worldwide in the biggest shake-up of a Big Four accounting firm in two decades, according to three people with knowledge of the plans.</p> <h2>If Davos is a verb, then DD has Davosed for you</h2> <p>Russia, rates, recession and resilience. Those were the buzzwords that dominated the first gathering of the <strong>World Economic Forum </strong>in Davos since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. </p> <p>Time will tell whether the slimmed-down crowd that assembled in the Swiss Alps this week was due to the event's unusual timing (in May instead of January) or a growing recognition that the insights proffered by the global elite fall short.</p> <p>Either way, there was little to celebrate. Business leaders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6aaa86a5-d66d-4e1a-96a6-6f6eb1b30a36\">presented a gloomy outlook</a>, consisting of disrupted supply chains, inflationary pressure and the forces of deglobalisation. World leaders had few solutions for the crisis in Ukraine or how to end Europe's addiction to Russian oil and gas. </p> <p>The technology companies that have been the main attraction for the past several years seemed to generate almost no buzz. <strong>Google</strong> (<strong>Alphabet</strong>), <strong>Facebook</strong> (<strong>Meta</strong>), <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>Palantir</strong> held their usual posts on Davos's main promenade — but their sagging share prices appeared to have halted the companies' march on the global economy. </p> <p><strong>Salesforce</strong> founder <strong>Marc</strong> <strong>Benioff</strong> threw his customary opening and closing parties, capped with a performance by the electronic music duo <strong>The Chainsmokers</strong> — who frankly were hard to distinguish from the legions of crypto bros in attendance. Not far from the venue was <strong>Medical House of Psychedelics</strong>, which made its debut and offered the crowd mind-altering experiences to escape reality.</p> <p>For those who stayed away, the mood wasn't much brighter. <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/324b1b48-7a73-4c18-8713-aa1eaff5d2e7\">was stuck</a> in the US after suffering a rebuke from <strong>JPMorgan</strong> investors over his pay, while <strong>Shell</strong>'s annual meeting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomas_m_wilson/status/1529065270702112772\">was interrupted</a> for nearly three hours by climate change protests.</p> <p>The little optimism found in Davos came from the Middle East. High oil prices are filling the coffers of Gulf countries led by Saudi Arabia. Cue the onslaught of bankers and financiers cozying up to the kingdom and <strong>Saudi Aramco</strong>, newly minted as the world's largest company by market cap. The Davos Man never had much time for human rights concerns anyway, unless a black-tie gala was involved.</p> <p>Bankers who DD met gleefully declared the end of talent wars that have forced costs inside their operations to soar. If weak activity continues, lay-offs will probably be in focus, as will not replacing departed staff. Bonuses will probably be down significantly from last year's record levels.</p> <p>Not everyone was so downbeat though. Investment manager <strong>Anthony</strong> “<strong>The</strong> <strong>Mooch</strong>” <strong>Scaramucci</strong>, the shortlived press secretary to former US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, told one FT reporter that the overwhelmingly bearish mood in Davos was his cue to bet the other way. </p> <p>“Everything they think is going to happen doesn't happen,” he said of previous Davos projections.</p> <p>The Mooch was a gracious host throughout the week, putting on his “100 point” wine event, where he was overheard asking several women their Zodiac signs. </p> <p>Who needs prophecies from Davos when you can look to the stars? </p> <h2>Glencore's reputational rescue mission</h2> <p>What do “newspapers”, “filings” and “chocolates” have in common?</p> <p>Until recently, DD would&#xa0;guess all those things can be found in the FT newsroom on a good day. But after combing through filings from US prosecutors' case against resources giant <strong>Glencore</strong>, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1dcb279f-8cd1-4538-9e28-d5a0b74195e5\">pleaded guilty</a> to multiple counts of bribery and market manipulation this week, the words have taken on a new meaning.</p> <p>The office paraphernalia and sugary treats were among the code names used by Glencore employees as they used cash payments, sham consulting agreements and inflated invoices to bribe government officials in west Africa and Latin America in return for preferential access to oil, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3d8f7fd-4c73-417e-bd4c-41951a33792f\">according to US court filings</a>.</p> <p>In November 2018, for example, an unidentified trader told a West African agent that a $90,000 payment was required for newspaper reading material, aka paying bribes to manipulate fuel oil markets, according to court documents.</p> <p>The company has agreed to pay $1.06bn to settle charges in the US and Brazil. That leaves roughly $500mn to cover the UK bill, the size of which will be&#xa0;determined next month. Glencore is also the subject of ongoing investigations in Switzerland and the Netherlands.</p> <p>The London-listed miner's shares rose as much as 5.3 per cent on Tuesday after it admitted to bribery and market manipulation, trading near all-time highs. Shares are up more than 43 per cent for the year.</p> <p>But many analysts still believe it trades at a discount because of its reputational issues.</p> <p>Valuations are historically low, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e5298c7-412f-41ad-a2aa-9c02a68aa8d7\">according to Lex's calculations</a>. Glencore is trading at about half the multiples just before the international probes began in 2018.</p> <h2>Drahi's luck goes from bad to worse</h2> <p><strong>Patrick Drahi </strong>just can't seem to catch a break.</p> <p>The Franco Israeli cable billionaire who controls <strong>Altice</strong>, the French telecoms business that some have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4aa050e-f85b-4cb9-9434-2deb280bc6e8\">speculated to be plotting</a> a takeover of the UK's former telecoms monopoly <strong>BT</strong>, has seen disappointing performance at <strong>Altice USA</strong>.</p> <p>The division, which he spun off from its heavily indebted European parent in 2017, has left him sitting on more than $4bn in paper losses as of last month. </p> <p>To add to Drahi's woes, the cable group's 18 per cent holding in BT has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/955e3554-c843-4f06-a981-6869ea43d071\">come under scrutiny</a> by the UK government just weeks before the investment vehicle will become free to make a takeover bid for the prized national asset.</p> <p>Altice increased its existing 12 per cent stake in BT to 18 per cent in December. At the time, it maintained it didn't plan to make an offer for the UK telecoms group. That prevented the company from making an unsolicited offer for six months due to the UK takeover code.</p> <p>On Thursday, with the six-month mark in mid-June swiftly approaching, the government <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/bt-acquisition-called-in-for-national-security-assessment\">announced</a> that Altice's 6 per cent increase to his BT stake has been called in for a full national security assessment by the UK's business secretary <strong>Kwasi Kwarteng</strong>.</p> <p>Kwarteng has launched the probe under the new National Security and Investment Act, which came into effect on January 4 and allows greater scrutiny of foreign takeovers of British companies in sensitive industries.</p> <p>But BT shareholders might welcome intervention from the M&amp;A watchdog, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fb407e8-4758-4dc9-a609-12e01b99ca31\">as Lex points out</a>. </p> <p>Drahi's highly leveraged investment style has stuck Altice with a significant debt pile, fuelling speculation in the City that Altice could be partially leaning on derivatives and stock borrowings.</p> <p>That would be a fitting strategy for Drahi, who built his empire through aggressive, debt-fuelled deals. It's less of a match for a 175-year-old national telecoms infrastructure business.</p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Toshiba</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/995bddb8-c310-466b-82e1-119c4414a392\">has agreed</a> to shake up its board with activist-backed directors. Former chief executive <strong>Satoshi Tsunakawa</strong> will be replaced as chair by <strong>Houlihan Lokey </strong>executive<strong> Akihiro Watanabe</strong>.<strong> Eijiro Imai</strong>, managing director of <strong>Farallon Capital</strong>'s Japanese arm, and <strong>Nabeel Bhanji</strong>, a senior portfolio manager at <strong>Elliott Management</strong>, will also become non-executive directors.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>RBC Capital Markets</strong> has appointed <strong>Chris</strong> <strong>Brooks</strong> as vice-chair of European industrials, and <strong>Giuseppe</strong> <strong>Chiusa</strong> as head of business services on the same team. They join from <strong>Barclays</strong> and <strong>UBS</strong>, respectively. </p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Smart reads</strong></p> <p><strong>Credit Suisse's man in Moscow </strong>Babak Dastmaltschi drove a profitable niche for the Swiss lender as the go-to dealmaker for Russia's ultra-rich.
