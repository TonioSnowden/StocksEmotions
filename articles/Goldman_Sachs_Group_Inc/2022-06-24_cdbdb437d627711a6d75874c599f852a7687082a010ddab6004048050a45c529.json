  "title": "Retail Investors Face $1.3 Billion Hit After Asset Manager's Detour Into Startups; Many investors were unaware that as its core life-settlement business failed, GWG Holdings would transfer hundreds of millions of dollars into startup ventures created by the company's former leaders",
  "text": "<p>Since 2018, GWG has invested at least $230 million into former chairman Brad Heppner's alternative-finance startup, the Beneficient Group Co LP, which aims to help wealthy people and institutions convert illiquid assets into cash. The company also put $28 million into FOXO Technologies Inc., a biotech venture backed by GWG founder Jon Sabes, which uses saliva tests to harvest people's DNA and predict when they are likely to die, the people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>But GWG no longer controls either of the startup ventures. Mr. Heppner, Mr. Sabes, and their associates carved out both ventures as independent entities shortly before the company collapsed into bankruptcy in April.</p><p>The judge overseeing the court proceedings in Houston said he had never before seen a company give up control of everything it owns before seeking chapter 11 protection.</p><p>GWG, which employed 160 people as of December 2020, is now a shell operation with just two employees remaining. The company is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and faces lawsuits from investors who claim they were defrauded. GWG has denied wrongdoing and said it fully disclosed its business risks to investors.</p><p>\"The litigation brought against GWG is baseless and without merit and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously,\" a company spokesman said, adding that GWG expects to work with its investors to maximize its value in a reorganization plan.</p><p>Brooke Halpin, a 72-year-old author and music composer in the Los Angeles area, said he bought $62,000 worth of L Bonds from a broker after hearing in a sales pitch how they were backed by a large pool of life-insurance policies. He was unaware when GWG changed its business model in 2019 to invest in other assets, including the startups created by company leaders, he said.</p><p>\"We didn't even know about it. They didn't seek any input from investors,\" said Mr. Halpin, who isn't a party to any of the class-action lawsuits.</p><p>Many of the investors in the L Bonds, like Mr. Halpin, are elderly. A number of other L Bond holders also described buying the securities after being told by their brokers that they yielded more than other corporate bonds, and were supported by revenue streams from life settlements.</p><p>GWG said it required its broker-dealers to make sure that the investors had sufficient net worth to sustain the risks inherent in making the investment. The company also told investors in 2019 that it would stop buying new life-insurance policies and shift its business model to investing in Beneficient. But many holders of L Bonds bought them before the company became a startup incubator, in what was a major change from its longtime business of betting on mortality by buying people's life insurance policies and waiting for them to die.</p><p>Bets on Unusual Assets</p><p>Mr. Sabes founded the company in 2006 with his brother Steven, scions of a prominent business family in Minneapolis whose father made a fortune running a hospitality chain that included casinos, restaurants and a strip club, as well as \"Minus 5\" bars that were made of ice.</p><p>Using money from a German bank, the Sabes brothers started accumulating life-insurance policies, often for around 20 cents on the dollar from people who needed cash. In 2012, GWG created the L Bond, which pooled money from retail investors to cover premium payments and buy new policies.</p><p>Soon though, their life-settlement business was failing, people familiar with the matter said. People were living longer than GWG expected they would. That meant the company had to pay more monthly premiums to maintain the policies it owned, and wait longer to collect the insurance payouts.</p><p>Mr. Sabes wanted to get out of his investment in GWG, according to these people, and focus entirely on his DNA testing venture, which he believed would create a \"predictor of mortality\" that would revolutionize the insurance industry. GWG had already begun asking potential customers to do saliva tests, and obtained dozens of DNA samples this way, some of these people said.</p><p>In 2017, Mr. Sabes found a match in Mr. Heppner, a financier who had worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. before becoming an entrepreneur in the financial-services space.</p><p>Mr. Heppner's venture, Beneficient, was at the time a fledgling startup that aimed to help wealthy people and institutions monetize illiquid assets they owned, such as stakes in private-equity, venture-capital or hedge funds. To make it a reality, he needed a ready way to raise capital and accumulate assets under management, according to people familiar with the startup.</p><p>In GWG, Mr. Heppner found a company that had proven itself at raising capital, with an established network of around 140 bond dealers throughout the country, adept at selling securities to individual investors willing to bet on unusual assets.</p><p>And the Sabes brothers found a way to cash out.</p><p>With help from a private-equity firm, Paul Capital Advisors, Beneficient gained effective control of GWG in 2019, buying out the founding brothers for $25 million and a promise that GWG would fund their DNA testing venture, according to securities filings and people familiar with the matter.</p><p>While they were working on closing the merger, the Sabes brothers also took out $18 million in dividend payments, the filings and people said.</p><p>Murray Holland, the banker who helped put the deal together, used shares contributed by Paul Capital to vote to replace GWG's board of directors with a slate of directors designated by Beneficient, according to the filings.</p><p>Mr. Holland became GWG's chief executive officer, while Mr. Heppner became chairman of the board. GWG continued selling L Bonds, but stopped buying life-insurance policies and instead used the proceeds to help develop Beneficient's business.</p><p>A representative for Mr. Sabes and FOXO said that GWG's board at the time believed the Beneficent transaction offered a compelling opportunity for GWG to diversify its business, expand its alternative asset balance sheet, increase its equity, and generate new sources of revenues.</p><p>But following the merger, GWG and Beneficient discovered an accounting complication arising from Beneficient's unique business model, which uses charitable trusts to acquire customers' assets, while funding the acquisitions through loans provided by a subsidiary.</p><p>Speedy Divorce</p><p>By October 2020, federal securities regulators had begun investigating GWG and delivered a subpoena requesting information about the company. The SEC later asked for additional information about the L Bonds, various accounting issues, and the consolidation of the business with Beneficient.</p><p>GWG would wait more than a year before disclosing the investigation to its investors, selling more than $200 million L Bonds in the interim. The company stopped sales of L Bonds last April when its latest auditor, Grant Thornton, delayed the filing of its financials while it waited for a response from the SEC after asking it to provide direction on the key question of how to account for the assets managed by Beneficient.</p><p>In July 2021, the SEC said that GWG and Beneficient had been doing their accounting incorrectly, and should have categorized assets in the charitable trusts as an investment instead of as a loan receivable.</p><p>Within months, Beneficent separated itself from GWG, less than three years after their merger. As part of the decoupling, which became effective in November, GWG ceded its rights to appoint directors to the Beneficient board. If Beneficient follows through on its plans to go public, GWG will have a roughly 37% stake in the venture after dilution from other investors. In return for giving up control of Beneficient, GWG swapped its shares in the venture for higher-ranking preferred stock.</p><p>Mr. Heppner, Beneficient's CEO, would also own a roughly 30% to 40% stake in the venture should it succeed in going public, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Another finance entity he has ties to has lent $150 million to Beneficent, and was partly repaid using money contributed by GWG, the people said.</p><p>After correcting its financial statements, GWG took another crack at selling more L Bonds last December. But sales went poorly, in part because brokers it had formerly worked with refused to keep selling the bonds. By this point, the SEC had also begun to investigate the brokers themselves, according to people familiar with the matter and court records.</p><p>Grant Thornton, GWG's third auditor in as many years, resigned on New Year's Eve. The company once again delayed filing its financials and ceased further bond sales. Grant Thornton declined to comment.</p><p>Having to stop its bond sales again precipitated GWG's collapse, as the company depended on continuous sales to repay holders of older debt. Without the ability to sell more bonds, the company had insufficient cash to make a January payment owed to L Bond holders, triggering the chapter 11 filing.</p><p>The Aftermath</p><p>Last week, the SEC charged broker-dealer Western International Securities Inc. with having recommended and sold GWG's L Bonds to retail customers without having a reasonable basis to believe the investments were in their clients' best interests. A Western International spokesman said that the firm takes its clients' best interests very seriously and believes it complied with regulatory guidance.</p><p>Meanwhile, holders of L Bonds are hoping they can get at least some of their money back. In addition to the stakes in Beneficent and FOXO, GWG owns life-insurance policies that are worth an estimated $680 million, according to a GWG lawyer.</p><p>Investors, however, will need to wait for the deaths of the people attached to those policies before collecting. The policy owners have an average remaining life expectancy of roughly six years, according to securities filings and a person familiar with the matter. And any proceeds from those policies would have to go first to repaying institutional investors who have lent at least $380 million to GWG.</p><p>GWG currently owns 80% of FOXO, the Sabes brothers' DNA testing venture, but that stake will be diluted down to a 9.4% economic interest and 12% of the voting power once it goes public under a planned deal with a special-purpose acquisition company, according to a securities filing. Mr. Sabes is expected to retain about 9% of the economic interest, but have 38% of the voting power, the filing said.</p><p>As for Beneficent, it has been growing since receiving a charter last July to conduct its business in Kansas. It said in March that it now has a loan portfolio of more than $520 million.</p><p>Paul Capital, the private-equity firm that provided the core portfolio of assets that helped Beneficient get its business off the ground, recently sued the company as well as GWG's CEO, Mr. Holland. The suit alleged that they failed to deliver the cash that Paul Capital expected it would receive when the firm handed its assets over to Beneficient.</p><p>Beneficient has disputed the merits of Paul Capital's claims. Paul Capital didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>\"Beneficient is experiencing strong momentum in its business and as the company continues executing on its vision to democratize the alternative asset industry, we understand and fully appreciate that our success could directly benefit GWG and its financial stakeholders, including L Bond holders,\" a spokesman for the Beneficient said.</p><p>But Beneficient hasn't produced audited financial statements or cleared up its exact relationship with GWG, Kansas Banking Commissioner David Herndon said in an April letter to state lawmakers.</p><p>\"The companies are financially intertwined and have been historically managerially intertwined,\" his letter said. \"But the continued absence of audited financial statements has made their exact relationship difficult to determine.\"</p><p>Write to Alexander Gladstone at alexander.gladstone@wsj.com</p><p>Retail Investors Face $1.3 Billion Hit After Asset Manager's Detour Into Startups</p>",
