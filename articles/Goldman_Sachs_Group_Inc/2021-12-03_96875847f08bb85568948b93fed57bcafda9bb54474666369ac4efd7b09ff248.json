  "text": "<p>Having its own securities license would allow Citi to underwrite yuan-denominated stock and bond offerings, and handle trading of these securities.</p><p>Citigroup is joining a rush by global banks to set up businesses in China that they control, after ownership restrictions that were in place for years were lifted following the signing of a trade deal between Washington and Beijing in early 2020. China now allows foreign financial institutions to establish wholly owned units dealing in securities, futures and asset management.</p><p>Both JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. were approved to take full ownership of their local securities ventures this year, after buying out stakes from their Chinese partners. Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS Group AG have also obtained majority control of their local securities units.</p><p>\"We continue to assess opportunities that will support our global and local clients' onshore business,\" Citigroup said.</p><p>Citigroup's path to its securities-license application has had some twists and turns. Back in 2012, the company set up a minority-owned securities joint venture with Shanghai-based Orient Securities.</p><p>After later failing to get the Chinese partner to agree to a deal that would give Citi control of the venture, Citi exited the partnership. In 2019 the two sides agreed to have Orient Securities buy out Citigroup's 33.33% stake in Orient Citi Securities.</p><p>In September 2020, Citigroup was the first American bank to be awarded a domestic fund custody license in China. Its custody business, which will allow it to serve asset-management clients in China, is expected to be operational by the end of this year, after it finishes setting up local infrastructure and systems, the person familiar with the matter said.</p><p>In October this year, Citi announced a strategic partnership with China Guangfa Bank in providing cross-border wealth services under what is known as the Wealth Management Connect program. The arrangement lets mainlanders in nine cities in the southern province of Guangdong buy investment products in neighboring Hong Kong and Macau, while individual investors in those two cities will be able to buy onshore products.</p><p>The partnership with Guangfa Bank, based in Guangzhou, came after Citigroup's move early this year to shed most of its consumer banking operations across Asia, while doubling down on managing wealth for the region's rising number of affluent individuals. The exits included mainland China, where the bank has had branches since 2007; India; South Korea; and Australia. Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the bank's wealth hubs, will continue to host consumer banking operations.</p><p>The transition is part of a series of initiatives unveiled under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser.</p><p>Citigroup plans to recruit 1,100 private bankers and relationship managers as well as 1,200 technical and operational staffers in Hong Kong and Singapore, and aims to increase assets under management for clients in Asia to $450 billion by 2025.</p><p>Write to Jing Yang at Jing.Yang@wsj.com</p><p>Citigroup Applies for China Securities License</p>",
