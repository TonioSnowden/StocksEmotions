  "text": "<p>Russian discount retailer Fix Price is planning a London stock market listing that could value the company at more than $6bn.</p> <p>The initial public offering, which would aim to raise at least $1bn, would be the largest by a Russian company in London since 2017. Fix Price filed the paperwork with the stock exchange on Monday and is aiming to list in March.</p> <p>The chain, whose business model is akin to that of the UK's B&amp;M and Dollar General in the US, has prospered in recent years because of a slump in living standards that has pushed Russians towards discount retailers. </p> <p>It has a range of about 1,800 products, including household goods, cosmetics and food, which it sells at fixed prices all under Rbs250 ($3.40), with about 80 per cent under Rbs100 ($1.03).</p> <p>The company operates more than 4,200 stores across Russia and the former USSR. Last year, revenues increased by 33 per cent to Rbs190.1bn ($2.6bn), with net profit of Rbs17.6bn. Like-for-like sales have risen at double-digit rates every quarter for 16 consecutive quarters.</p> <p>Companies like Fix Price have benefited from changing shopping habits in Russia as real incomes have fallen by 11 per cent since 2013, including a 3.4 per cent slump last year. </p> <p>X5 and Magnit, Russia's two largest food retailers, recently launched their own discount chains.</p> <p>Fix Price investors including founders Sergei Lomakin and Artem Khachatryan, as well as minority investors Goldman Sachs and&#xa0;Marathon Group, will sell shares in the IPO. </p> <p>Lomakin and Khachatryan, who set up Fix Price in 2007, plan to retain control of the company, according to people familiar with the matter. </p> <p>The shares&#xa0;will be tradeable as global depositary receipts, with a secondary listing&#xa0;on the Moscow exchange. </p> <p>BofA Securities, JPMorgan, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and VTB Capital will act as joint co-ordinators and joint bookrunners on the deal.</p> <p>Several Russian companies are eyeing foreign listings after a run of successful recent IPOs. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7a62669-9520-4488-9b72-0b83152eea69\">Ozon, one of Russia's largest online retailers</a>, went public in New York last year at a valuation of $6.2bn, since when its market capitalisation has risen to more than $13bn. </p> <p>Forestry group Segezha, online streaming entertainment platform ivi, and gold miner GV Gold are all considering IPOs, according to people familiar with their plans.</p> <p><em>This article has been updated to clarify that VTB Capital are not selling shares in the IPO.</em></p><p>Source: Max Seddon in Moscow 2021 'Russian discount retailer aims to raise $1bn in London IPO' FT.com 15 February.
