  "title": "AT&T CEO says Wall Street critics are wrong about the company's promotions; 'We are actually gaining customers in a lot of different places and a lot of different ways,' CEO John Stankey says an investor conference",
  "text": "<p>Read: Here are the iPhone 14 deals from AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon as preorders begin</p><p>Stankey said Monday that those focused on AT&amp;T's consumer wireless deals misunderstand the broader story of the company's growth.</p><p>\"We've had great share shifts that have occurred in certain segments of the market,\" including the public-sector business, Stankey said at a Goldman Sachs conference Monday. AT&amp;T's public-sector momentum is \"not based on promotion\" but rather the company's investments in improving its public-safety network in ways that allow AT&amp;T to \"penetrate into a segment that we were previously grossly underpenetrated in.\"</p><p>Additionally, AT&amp;T has \"seen that same dynamic move into the upper end and mid part of the business market where our share performance has improved,\" he said, according to a transcript of the presentation provided by Sentieo.</p><p>Read: Verizon says it's 'very challenging being the premium brand' but that new efforts will pay off</p><p>While Goldman Sachs analyst Brett Feldman acknowledged Stankey's commentary about the more business-oriented aspects of AT&amp;T's business that aren't linked to heavy promotions, he also said that AT&amp;T's consumer offers are clearly playing some role in AT&amp;T's subscriber hauls, which come as the broader industry has seen subscriber growth well in excess of population expansion for years.</p><p>AT&amp;T's promotional strategy is working, Feldman said, but it leads investors to wonder what will happen to the industry, and the company, when consumer demand for the wireless sector slows.</p><p>Stankey said that even the consumer aspect of AT&amp;T's promotional tactics gets misinterpreted. While device subsidies are \"one element\" of the cost that AT&amp;T takes on to acquire or retain a customer, he said the company has also adopted a more understandable model for customers that lets the company \"spend less money communicating the message.\"</p><p>\"We are getting probably the best yields in our promotional advertising that we've ever done, but we're not spending nearly at the levels we've historically spent, and I will tell you, we're not spending at the top of the industry right now,\" he said.</p><p>Don't miss: T-Mobile announces $14 billion share-buyback program</p><p>See also: T-Mobile sees huge demand for $3 billion bond deal despite September borrowing blitz by big companies</p><p>Stankey offered that a lower-growth landscape wouldn't necessarily be worse for the company.</p><p>\"I would tell you our equation very much hangs together when you look at the overall aggregate view of this,\" he said.</p><p>AT&amp;T CEO says Wall Street critics are wrong about the company's promotions</p>",
