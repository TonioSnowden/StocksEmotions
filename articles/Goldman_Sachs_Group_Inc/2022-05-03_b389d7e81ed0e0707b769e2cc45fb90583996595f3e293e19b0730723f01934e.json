  "title": "MicroStrategy Recruits New CFO Amid Bitcoin Push, Wider Losses; The software firm said Andrew Kang would succeed Phong Le, who will continue to serve as president",
  "text": "<p>Prior to joining GreenSky, which Goldman Sachs Group Inc. acquired in March, Mr. Kang worked as a corporate treasurer at Santander Holdings USA, a bank-holding company. He also held finance and treasury positions at several other banks.</p><p>On Tuesday, MicroStrategy reported revenue fell 2.9% to $119.3 million in the first quarter, compared with the prior-year period. Its net losses widened to $130.8 million for the quarter from $110 million during the year-ago period, in part due to an impairment charge related to the value of its bitcoins.</p><p>The company—alongside payment firm Block Inc. and auto maker Tesla Inc.—is among a smattering of businesses with substantial bitcoin holdings. MicroStrategy said it held $2.9 billion of the cryptocurrency in book value as of March 31, up from $1.95 billion a year earlier.</p><p>Last month, the company said it purchased about 4,167 bitcoins for $190.5 million in cash between Feb. 15 and April 4, bringing its total holdings to 129,218 bitcoins.</p><p>A week ago, MicroStrategy said it would let its staff put part of their 401(k) retirement savings in bitcoin as part of a new offeringfrom financial-services giant Fidelity Investments Inc.</p><p>In letters made public in January, the Securities and Exchange Commission told MicroStrategy to revise the way it discloses its bitcoin holdings in future filings. The firm had been stripping out trading volatility in bitcoin when it used measures not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Mr. Le had told the SEC that the inclusion of such impairment losses could distract from investors' analysis of the company's operating results, but the company amended its disclosures accordingly.</p><p>Mr. Kang has a strong finance background, but it will likely take some time for him to transition into the software world, said Brent Thill, a senior analyst at Jefferies Group LLC, a financial-services firm.</p><p>\"His job will be to focus the company on the core operations rather than being distracted on bitcoin,\" Mr. Thill said.</p><p>MicroStrategy declined to comment further.</p><p>Write to Mark Maurer at Mark.Maurer@wsj.com</p><p>MicroStrategy Recruits New CFO Amid Bitcoin Push, Wider Losses</p>",
