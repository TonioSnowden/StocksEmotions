  "title": "Electronic Music Hobby Leads Goldman Sachs CEO to Lollapalooza; David Solomon will perform at the music festival this summer",
  "text": "<p>The four-day event, held annually in Chicago, features more than 170 musical acts and attracts hundreds of thousands of revelers annually.</p><p>Most ticket buyers will likely be swayed by headliner acts like Green Day, Doja Cat and Metallica. But when Mr. Solomon takes the stage, he can still expect a more enthusiastic greeting than the polite applause that bank executives typically receive at investor conferences. \"Every Lolla lineup makes hands wave, heads nod, and crowds holler,\" the festival says on its website.</p><p>All that nodding and hollering doesn't come cheap, however. Ticket prices start at $350 for the event, while the most expensive list for more than $4,000. Luckily for Goldman employees hoping to catch a glimpse of their boss outside of working hours, times are good: The firm posted blockbuster results and boosted compensation by 33% in 2021.</p><p>Mr. Solomon, who earned $35 million in pay from his day job last year, won't be turning his hobby into a second career despite the big break. He plans to donate his appearance fee to charity.</p><p>Write to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com</p><p>Electronic Music Hobby Leads Goldman Sachs CEO to Lollapalooza</p>",
