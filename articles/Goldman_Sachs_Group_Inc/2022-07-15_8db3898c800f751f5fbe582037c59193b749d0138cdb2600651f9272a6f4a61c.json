  "text": "<p>With a 0.75-percentage-point rate increase at Fed policy makers' next meeting later this month nearly baked into the market, investors are looking for safety where they can find it, and drug stocks offer some stability. The industry is trading in virtual lockstep with the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index -- with tighter conditions sending drug stocks up -- as investors flock to stocks that tend to weather recessions relatively well.</p><p>\"The predominance of macro in conversations with investors is about as acute as I've ever seen it,\" said Asad Haider, a senior healthcare strategist at Goldman.</p><p>Recession fears drove a 9% gain for the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index over the past year versus a 13.1% decline for the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Not all healthcare is holding up as well. Industries that provide discretionary services, such as dental clinics and hospitals, are suffering as consumers postpone care. But for the drug industry, a recession may not be so bad because demand for medicines is relatively inelastic, meaning people will cut down on vacations, but not on their pills. That should allow companies such as Pfizer and Merck to maintain relatively healthy margins during a slowdown. It also means their above-average dividends look safe.</p><p>While that might be partly priced in given their recent outperformance, drug stocks' defensive rally may not have run its course yet, especially if inflation drives the Fed toward more hawkishness. Trading at about 14.6 times forward earnings, the drug sector trades at a discount to the S&amp;P 500's 16.1 times, according to FactSet. If the economy worsens, drug stocks should continue to close that gap.</p><p>Rising rates erode the relative value of dividend payments, so how well drug stocks do will depend on whether industry leaders can convince the market that they can grow earnings in the medium-to-longer term as many key drugs go off patent. Out of the industry's $900 billion in 2021 revenue, about $230 billion will lose patent protection between 2025 and 2030, according to Mr. Haider. At the same time, he says, the industry has at least $700 billion in firepower for deals, based on cash positions and the sector's ability to take on new debt.</p><p>Drug companies that have a clear earnings-growth trajectory are the most attractive. Eli Lilly, with several promising pipeline assets including an obesity drug, is up 37% over the past 12 months.</p><p>Mr. Haider thinks investors will reward companies that deliver on acquisitions of biotech companies with products at or near commercial potential. At a Goldman healthcare conference in June, executives at companies including Merck, Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson vowed to keep looking for deals. The Wall Street Journal reported in recent weeks that Merck could be near an acquisition of Seagen for about $40 billion. That would follow Pfizer's $11.6 billion acquisition of Biohaven announced in May and Bristol-Myers Squibb's $4.1 billion bet on Turning Point Therapeutics announced last month.</p><p>One major concern is drug-pricing legislation being negotiated in Washington. It looks as if some sort of drug-price bill will pass as part of a broader package, representing a revenue hit for the industry. But that could turn out to be something of a clearing event rather than a drag on shares. While provisions in the bill allowing for Medicare negotiation on a small list of drugs is a headwind for the industry, it will disproportionately affect companies more reliant on a single product such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which could suffer as much as a 15% revenue hit from caps on its macular degeneration drug Eylea. The industry will take a hit, but it should be manageable, with analysts predicting a few percentage points shaved off industry sales.</p><p>Investors looking for a place to hide could do worse than the drug sector.</p>",
