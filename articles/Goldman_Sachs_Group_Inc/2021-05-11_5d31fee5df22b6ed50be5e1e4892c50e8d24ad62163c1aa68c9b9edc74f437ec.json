  "text": "<p>The Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane has signalled that his colleagues on the Monetary Policy Committee are being too gloomy about the pace of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/512bf4aa-1906-498e-8763-1deefa029f87\">UK economy's recovery</a> from the pandemic.</p> <p>The central bank lifted its 2021 annual forecast last week from 5 per cent to 7.25 per cent, the highest level in almost 70 years. But Haldane suggested the projected rate of growth should have been higher, according to MPC minutes published last week.</p> <p>His stance emerged as an FT analysis found the bank's upgraded forecast for 2021 is based on a split view of the year, with better than expected growth in the first quarter but a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e328f03-29bb-4ffe-a60a-f7e09596462b\">downgrade to the outlook </a>for the other nine months.</p> <p>The FT analysis of the bank's figures show it has become more gloomy about the pace of recovery until 2023, with cuts in expected growth in every quarter from April-June 2021 until the end of 2022.</p> <p>However, Haldane took a different view. There was now evidence that “the economy was growing rapidly, with both household and company spending surprising significantly and persistently to the upside, and consumer and business confidence bouncing back,” he said, according to the MPC minutes.</p> <p>Haldane said “there were good reasons for believing this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bbb2973d-6086-4951-9747-bfa4f08f409b\">strength in domestic demand </a>would be maintained, including by the running down of the large stock of<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1660c16d-a334-4334-8285-18c8d5842910\"> accumulated savings, </a>leading to a larger and more sustained period of excess demand than was incorporated in the May central projections”.</p> <p>He also dissented from the other eight MPC members by voting to limit quantitative easing this year.</p> <p>Haldane has warned that an overly-gloomy view of the recovery creates the danger of rapidly rising inflation. But he also recognised on Friday that there was still much uncertainty over economic prospects and a rapid recovery over the summer was not guaranteed.</p> <p>When governor Andrew Bailey explained the BoE's thinking last week, he did not note that the entire upgrade of the annual growth figure was accounted for by a change in the central bank's view of past economic performance. Nor did Bailey highlight that the bank had become more pessimistic about growth prospects.</p> <p>The MPC's move to scale back the expected bounce in growth came even though the recent Budget is pumping more money than previously assumed into the economy and despite evidence that businesses are bringing forward investment to take advantage of a corporation tax deduction.</p> <p>But during his news conference, Bailey gave the impression that the new forecasts were more optimistic for quarterly growth than the previous iteration. “Demand growth is boosted by a decline in health risks and a fall in uncertainty, as well as fiscal and monetary stimulus,” the governor said.</p> <p>The FT analysed and compared the February and May forecasts and found that the BoE had revised them down for the second quarter of the year by 0.9 percentage points and by 0.65 percentage points in both the third and fourth quarters. The growth forecasts were also revised down slightly for the whole of 2022.</p> <p>The BoE and Haldane declined to comment, but the chief economist is expected to outline his more optimistic view before he departs the central bank at the end of June in either a speech or in an appearance before a parliamentary committee. </p> <p>Last Friday, Haldane said the “triple whammy” of the 2008 financial crisis, Brexit and the coronavirus pandemic had hit the economy hard, but was now “approaching the point at which all three uncertainties are dissipating”.</p> <p>Figures for the first quarter on Wednesday are likely to confirm economists' view that the lockdown this year was far less damaging to activity than the initial closure of the economy last spring. </p> <p>Haldane's view is that the resilience shown by consumers in the first quarter reflects a pent-up desire to spend and that if this continued over the summer it would threaten to take inflation considerably above the BoE's 2 per cent target later this year.</p> <p>Haldane warned that bottlenecks in supply chains alongside rampant consumption “posed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/68bf8ab2-9ba0-49a7-9c05-e733cb8d870c\">upside risks to meeting the inflation target </a>over the medium term”. </p> <p>Other economists are also beginning to express concern about a re-emergence of inflation.</p> <p>Neil Shearing, group chief economist of Capital Economics, said that “all the ingredients for a rise in inflation are there”, but he added that the evidence suggested that the UK was not likely to be hardest hit. “There is much greater scope for a rebound in inflation in the US than in Europe or Japan,” he said. </p> <p>Most economists are revising their forecasts sharply higher, with Goldman Sachs expecting almost 8 per cent growth this year. But the National Institute of Economic and Social Research published forecasts on Monday that were considerably more pessimistic than the BoE's, with a slow recovery, stemming from a more pessimistic view on exports and business investment.</p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ddbcca6-de67-43a1-ba9c-d4508d882f74\"><em>BoE overshoots may prove happy forecast errors</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ddbcca6-de67-43a1-ba9c-d4508d882f74\"><em>From Peter Doyle, Washington, DC, US</em></a></p><p>Source: Chris Giles, Economics Editor 2021 'Bank of England's chief economist says colleagues are too gloomy on outlook' FT.com 11 May.
