  "title": "China's New Home Prices Fall for First Time in Six Years as Rules Bite; Average prices in 70 major cities edged down 0.08% in September from August, the first such month-on-month decline since 2015",
  "text": "<p>In all, 27 of the 70 cities recorded a month-on-month price increase in September, according to the statistics bureau—down from 46 cities in August and the lowest such number since February 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic froze activity across the country.</p><p>Prices of new homes in China's so-called third-tier cities fell 0.2% from the previous month, after remaining unchanged in August, the statistics bureau said.</p><p>Yan Yuejin, research director at Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution, said the official figures closely matched his own observations, which have led him to conclude that the market was on the cusp of tipping from \"overheating to overcooling.\"</p><p>Compared with a year earlier, average new home prices rose 3.26% in September, slowing from August's 3.70%. New home prices rose in 59 of 70 cities in September from a year earlier, the same as in August.</p><p>As Beijing has further tightened rules in the red-hot property sector—including imposing borrowing curbs on developers and limiting their sources of financing—local governments, which derive roughly one-third of their revenue from selling land to property developers, have grown increasingly concerned.</p><p>Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province in far northeastern China, is one of the first Chinese cities to introduce measures to support property developers and provide subsidies for home buyers. Home prices in Harbin fell 0.7% in September from a year earlier, a slight deterioration from August's 0.6% decline.</p><p>Goldman Sachs economists said in a note Wednesday that, while officials may ease restrictions somewhat around the margin, \"the policy direction of deleveraging the property sector is unlikely to shift, which could continue to weigh on overall growth next year.\"</p><p>Bingyan Wang contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com</p><p>China's New Home Prices Fall for First Time in Six Years as Rules Bite</p>",
