  "text": "<p>Ransomware has become a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/colonial-pipeline-energy-oil-gas-ransomware-265fb398-4ff6-48a2-a49c-9ae43e745049.html\">global pandemic </a>of the cyber security kind, spreading across industry sectors from meatpacking to mass transit in the past few days.</p> <p>A rash of high-profile ransomware attacks began last month, when hackers extracted more than $4m after targeting the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e7eb146-967d-4213-8173-09f262d6ca0d\">Colonial oil pipeline</a>&#xa0;that connects Texas to the northeastern US.&#xa0;</p> <p>This week, systems at JBS, the Brazilian meat processing company with extensive operations in the US, were also&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95c62ed2-52de-4631-a58e-92333d0a8c1f\">infected&#xa0;</a>by ransomware, forcing slaughterhouses to cancel work shifts.</p> <p>A Massachusetts <a href=\"https://www.bostonherald.com/2021/06/02/ransomware-attack-ferry-service-to-marthas-vineyard-nantucket-is-latest-victim/\">ferry service was disrupted </a>by a ransomware attack on Wednesday and the Japanese medical device provider Fujifilm said it had also been <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/fujifilm-becomes-the-latest-victim-of-a-network-crippling-ransomware-attack/\">forced to shut down</a> parts of its global network after it was targeted.</p> <p>Attacks rose&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ransomware-attacks-soared-150-in/\">150 per cent</a>&#xa0;in 2020, according to Group-IB, a security firm. The average ransom payment increased more than&#xa0;<a href=\"https://securityandtechnology.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IST-Ransomware-Task-Force-Report.pdf\">300 per cent</a>, Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e7bdc3f-c016-4b8e-85fb-c7945a790fe5\">points out.</a></p> <p>It's led to the Biden administration <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9438881a-b7b0-4091-ab5d-34ad2e6bc973\">pressuring US businesses </a>to bolster their cyber defences. “We urge you to take ransomware crime seriously and ensure your corporate cyber defences match the threat . . . the threats are serious and they are increasing,” Anne Neuberger, deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, wrote in a memo on Thursday to business leaders.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f91c4e7-973b-4c1a-91c2-7742c3aa9922\">Insurers are also sounding warnings</a> about the rising costs of cover for such attacks and that companies need to increase their controls if they want insurance protection. From the start of April to mid-May, premiums jumped 27 per cent from last year's levels, according to the insurance broker Aon. </p> <p>Ransomware's pandemic proportions means some insurers are arguing governments will need to step in and provide a financial backstop. </p> <p>“There is a need to find a way to cover the risk, which is too large for the insurance industry itself,” said Isabelle Santenac, global insurance leader at consultancy EY. “There will be a need to find some public-private partnerships to ensure that the risk is covered [and] to also work on how to limit the risk and prevent the risk.”</p> <h2>The Internet of (Five) Things</h2> <p><strong>1. Google follows Apple in privacy tightening</strong> <br>Google is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff67e5a6-ca3e-42d2-98b8-01e656a6d396\">strengthening privacy protections</a> to counter Apple's image as a better steward of personal data. In changes that will come as a fresh blow to the near $400bn-a-year digital advertising industry, Google will introduce extra safeguards for Android users who opt out of sharing their “Advertising ID” — a device identifier that allows marketers to track them as they switch from app to app.</p> <p><strong>2. Palantir helps Babylon to market</strong><br>US big data company Palantir has taken a strategic stake in British health firm Babylon, as part of<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d41a17ca-8b06-4cb4-91f0-a410e52bf7a8\"> a $4.2bn blank-cheque deal </a>to take the start-up public in the US. Babylon, which offers a range of healthcare services to 24m patients via a mobile app, has agreed to merge with Nasdaq-listed special purpose acquisition company Alkuri Global.</p> <p><strong>3. Ant crawls back</strong><br>Chinese<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c571124-a1b6-4639-bf2f-14de2044590b\"> regulators have approved </a>Jack Ma's Ant Group to begin operating a new consumer finance company, in the first concrete sign of an easing of tensions with Beijing after Ant agreed to a “rectification” deal in April. The newly licensed unit is called Chongqing Ant Consumer Finance and can issue consumer loans, borrow from banks and issue bonds.</p> <p><strong>4. Elliott uploads Dropbox interest</strong><br>Elliott Management has<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/433a5c0d-5651-411d-b470-2442f8433c90\"> amassed a more than 10 per cent stake </a>in Dropbox, making the activist hedge fund the largest institutional shareholder in the cloud storage group. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76040ac1-9bd9-4bba-be03-60b544f9ebd8\">Lex says</a> it might try to nudge the company into selling to a user-hungry giant such as Oracle or Dell.</p> <p><strong>5. DeFi definitely crypto's latest VC crush</strong><br>The fastest-growing cryptocurrency start-ups of the past year have been those aiming to abolish financial intermediaries, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f179c8d-aa60-41d4-96d7-5d53e78c3514\">reports Miles Kruppa from Silicon Valley</a>. Decentralised finance, or “DeFi”, projects aim to replicate basic financial services such as lending and trading using software programs known as blockchains, cutting out traditional middlemen.</p> <h2>Forwarded from&#xa0;Sifted&#xa0;— the European start-up week</h2> <p>Taavet Hinrikus, the first employee of Skype and co-founder of fintech Wise (formerly TransferWise), is backing a&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/trading-app-lightyear-transferwise/\">new investing platform called Lightyear</a>&#xa0;which allows users to trade stocks free of commission and with lower foreign exchange fees. The platform, which has raised a&#xa0;$1.5m pre-seed round this week, will try to apply the core&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/transferwise-becomes-wise/\">Wise</a>&#xa0;principle of lowering FX fees to make it cheaper to buy international stocks, hoping to disrupt incumbent trading apps which often make a healthy margin on customers buying shares in different currencies. Hinrikus is now one of&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/inside-taavet-fund/\">Europe's most active angel investors</a>. He says he's backed over 100 start-ups in the past 13 years,&#xa0;with an average ticket size of&#xa0;£250k.</p> <p>Elsewhere in&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/rankings/european-startups-top-rankings\">European start-ups</a>&#xa0;this week, Sifted looked at which fintech companies offer the best — and worst —&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/fintech-equity-packages-europe/\">equity deals to employees</a>; while in funding news, Europe's best-financed scooter company&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/tier-60m-goldmansachs/\">Tier raised $60m from Goldman Sachs</a>&#xa0;and Edinburgh-based asset management firm&#xa0;<a href=\"https://sifted.eu/articles/sennder-raises-80m/\">Baillie Gifford backed Berlin-based freight forwarder Sennder</a>&#xa0;in an $80m Series D round.</p> <h2>Tech tools — Firefox refreshed</h2> <p>Firefox is probably not your first-choice browser, it comes third for me behind Chrome and Microsoft's Edge, but it can prove a useful alternative when cookies start causing problems and there is <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/fresh-new-look-for-firefox/\">a brand new version out </a>this week. The improvements are almost exclusively visual. Features include a new icon set, typography and spacing. The toolbar and menus have been streamlined and Tabs have been given a makeover “so they are now gently curved and float above the toolbar”. It all looks fresh, so perhaps it's worth a fresh look by you the user.</p><p>Source: Chris Nuttall in London 2021 'Rampant ransomware's raised threat level' FT.com 3 June.
