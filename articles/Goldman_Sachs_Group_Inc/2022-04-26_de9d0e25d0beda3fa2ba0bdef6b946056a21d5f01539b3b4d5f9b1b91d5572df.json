Nothing whatever newsworthy happened in markets yesterday, so it's back to recession risk and crypto. Email us your thoughts: <a href=\"mailto:robert.armstrong@ft.com\">robert.armstrong@ft.com</a> and <a href=\"mailto:ethan.wu@ft.com\">ethan.wu@ft.com</a>.&#xa0;</p> <h1>Can a recession be avoided?</h1> <p>Investors are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3276a8fd-63f3-4028-95dd-4248841fe28b\">starting to price in a Fed-induced economic slowdown</a> but still — in aggregate — believe that a recession can be avoided. </p> <p>It may be too late. A few weeks ago we cited a <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29910/w29910.pdf\">paper</a> by Alex Domash and Larry Summers pointing out that, since 1955, there have been eight instances where wage inflation was above 5 per cent and the unemployment rate was below 4 per cent, as they are now. In all eight, a recession followed within two years. </p> <p>History is not destiny, though. This is an anomalous historical moment because of both multiple supply shocks (first pandemic, now war) and extraordinary fiscal and monetary policy. There may be an economic escape route, this time around.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle thinks there is. What forces the Fed into recession-strength action is the emergence of a wage-price spiral. So the question is: how much does wage growth have to slow for the Fed to back off, and what are the preconditions for such slowing? Here is the thought process: &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <blockquote>  <p>First, we ask how much wage growth needs to slow to be compatible with the Fed's projection that inflation will gradually fall toward the 2 per cent target. Second, we ask how much the jobs-workers gap needs to shrink to achieve that slowdown in wage growth. Third, we estimate how far the elevated level of job openings would have to fall for reduced labor demand coupled with an assumed 1-1.5 million worker recovery in labor supply to shrink the jobs-workers gap sufficiently. Finally, we ask how much GDP growth would need to slow to reduce job openings by that amount, based on the statistical relationship between the two. </p> </blockquote> <p>Mericle's answer to the final question is GDP growth slowing to between 1 and 1.5 per cent. Here is the reasoning, depicted graphically:</p> <p>Don Rissmiller of Strategas agrees that wages are the key. If pay was not rising quickly, the Fed could just wait out inflation, given that it has been driven in large part by supply shocks. As Ben Bernanke said, in a different context, “the Fed can't create more oil” (indeed, waiting is what my colleague Martin Sandbu <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41c248a2-4d30-4a47-a10c-7e37459e1829\">thinks</a> the Fed and other central banks should do). But because wages, unlike goods prices, are sticky — once increased, they are hard to decrease — once they reach a certain growth threshold, they feed an upward cycle the Fed must break. </p> <p>We are reaching that threshold now, Rissmiller says. “The ECI [employment cost index] is running at about 4 per cent. If productivity is rising at a per cent or a per cent and a half, employers can just about hang in there,” without passing on big price increases to customers. But much higher than that and “it's on”, according to Rissmiller. Inducing a recession becomes the Fed's best option. (The ECI March report comes out Friday, by the way; the Fed will be watching and we will be, too).&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>So what has to happen for wage inflation to cool? “The private sector has to do some heavy lifting,” says Rissmiller. Specifically, the higher wages already on offer have to draw people into the labour market, closing the jobs-workers gap. So the data series to watch while you are wondering whether we will have a recession next year is, oddly, the labour force participation rate. It has been rising, but more is needed: </p> <h1>Crypto yield farming as venture capital</h1> <p>To oversimplify, crypto yield farming works like this:</p> <ul>  <li><p>You give me your mainstream cryptocurrency (tether, say) to hold on to.</p></li>  <li><p>In return I give you a “governance token” that I have invented from scratch. This is a cryptocurrency that acts as equity in my crypto lending business. The token confers voting power in my company to the holder and has some uses on my platform.</p></li>  <li><p>I lend your tether out to third parties, earning a fee. </p></li>  <li><p>You can sell your governance tokens on an outside crypto exchange for a profit, if all goes well. As a rule of thumb, your governance tokens will be worth more the more people use my service.</p></li>  <li><p>After a while, I return your crypto. </p></li> </ul> <p>On Monday Sam Bankman-Fried, chief executive of crypto exchange FTX, appeared on a much-discussed Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-25/odd-lots-full-transcript-sam-bankman-fried-and-matt-levine-on-crypto?srnd=oddlots\">podcast</a>, where he gave a tongue-in-cheek description of yield farming. Many read the interview as “crypto CEO admits crypto is a Ponzi scheme”, citing quotes like this, where he described crypto lending businesses as “boxes”:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Like this is a valuable box as demonstrated by all the money that people have apparently decided should be in the box. And who are we to say that they're wrong about that? . . . And so then, you know, [the governance] token price goes way up. And now it's a $130mn market cap token because of, you know, the bullishness of people's usage of the box. And now all of a sudden, of course, the smart money [goes and pours] another $300mn in the box and . . . it goes to infinity. And then everyone makes money.</p> </blockquote> <p>Leaving aside the (often valid) crypto/Ponzi comparison, there is an important point that got missed as everyone laughed at Bankman-Fried. Yield farming works much like a certain kind of equity financing in a growth start-up, where investors subsidise a product to help it build market share fast. As UChicago's Anthony Lee Zhang <a href=\"https://anthonyleezhang.substack.com/p/yield-farming-as-growth-hacking?s=w\">explains</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Yield farming is basically Silicon-Valley/Uber/MoviePass style highly subsidized-usage growth hacking, except it subsidizes users through newly issued equity instead of discounts paid out of VC's pockets . . . When MoviePass sells $30 of movies for $10, eventually MoviePass shows that it loses money and looks stupid. When MoviePass prints equity instead, MoviePass looks like it doesn't lose money, which I suppose is a benefit, but the equity holders pay through dilution . . . </p>  <p>The puzzle is why yield-farming protocol equity prices remain high enough for yield farming to work at all. Obviously one hypothesis is this is supported by a bubble/systematic overvaluation of protocol equity tokens, relative to fundamentals. But if this is the case, then yield farming is very smart, from the protocol's perspective, as a growth hacking strategy! </p> </blockquote> <p>The magic of crypto is turning hype into money — in this case, turning excitement about new business models into cheap funding for crypto companies. Maybe the companies being funded are no good; maybe the equity investors are getting misled. But there is no structural reason a few durable companies couldn't start by raising capital this way.</p> <p>Bankman-Fried was trying to make this point, as he explained in a less-discussed part of the podcast. He draws the comparison to food delivery services which, despite making losses on every sale, hang on thanks to VC funding and could well become viable businesses eventually:</p> <blockquote>  <p>The pandemic was a very trying period for some food delivery companies, because their unit economics were negative. Like, they were running at a loss and it had been for years and the pandemic meant more business, which meant more loss for them.</p>  <p>So paradoxically, it was negative. And how did that happen? . . . </p>  <p>Well, VCs keep funding them, right? People keep putting money into the company here. And the company then has ‘stock price goes up' because [revenue] goes up . . . </p>  <p>And then it gets more and more business and because it gets more business, people are like ‘that's great, losing even more, more bigger numbers. Let's put more money in.' The goal here being, collect all the money in your box. So you look a lot bigger than your competitors and they sort of give up and you win. And then in the end you get all the real business and basically it's just all an advertising budget, right?</p> </blockquote> <p>Of course, the most glaring difference between VCs funding food delivery, or even businesses like Netflix and Uber, and punters propping up a crypto lending service is anything resembling a clear story about long-term economic value. But not everyone is deterred.
