  "text": "<p>Howden, the UK-based insurance broker, has announced the takeover of rival Aston Lark, its largest acquisition to date and the latest in a string of deals by challengers hoping to take on the industry's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2921514c-9fb5-4082-8780-cde316619e4f\">top-tier firms</a>.</p> <p>Aston Lark places more than £1bn in annual gross written premiums for its commercial and private clients and provides employee benefit advice. The deal will take Howden, formerly known as Hyperion, to more than £6bn in premiums, across more than 1.7m policyholders. It builds on the takeover of A-Plan, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d7f181b-9409-4b79-ad3a-372f1b13891c\">announced</a> in September. </p> <p>Howden is buying Aston Lark from Goldman Sachs' asset management arm and UK-based private equity investor Bowmark Capital. The broker is paying £1.1bn, according to one person familiar with the terms of the deal. News of an impending deal was first reported by <em>Insurance Insider</em>.</p> <p>“Can we be a credible alternative [to the largest brokers]? Absolutely,” said David Howden, chief executive. The deal created a group with a combined enterprise value of more than $10bn, he said, and there were still “huge opportunities” to expand internationally. </p> <p>The insurance broking industry — built to help companies find insurance cover — is dominated by a few big groups, whose positions have been cemented by years of add-on deals. The top-four brokers by revenue for the past 10 years have been Marsh McLennan, Aon, Willis Towers Watson and Gallagher, with minor changes in the order.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6471af0-764d-49e7-87a0-dd2a2c110fd9\">collapse</a> this year of a tie-up between Aon and Willis, under pressure from US competition regulators, has been interpreted by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2921514c-9fb5-4082-8780-cde316619e4f\">executives</a> as making any future mergers among the biggest companies unlikely.</p> <p>Deal activity among smaller companies has continued apace, with broking groups such as Howden and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/728faa71-f719-48f0-9bf1-2cdf92ca2e73\">Ardonagh</a> hoping to beef up their challenge to the largest operators.</p> <p>Private equity investors have poured capital into challenger brokers in recent years, with Hg taking a stake in Howden <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0448027f-321d-4bba-8e8a-fe65ea019f70\">last year</a>, boosting Howden's capacity to make further acquisitions.</p> <p>Aston Lark's chief executive Peter Blanc will become executive chair of Howden's UK retail broking operations. He told the Financial Times the UK business would be “stepping up” its acquisitions of smaller brokers, targeting around 700 in the UK that have more than 10 staff. </p> <p>David Howden originally started his career in 1981 at Alexander Howden, a broker established by his great-great-great grandfather, though the family connection had since been lost.</p> <p>He founded Hyperion, as it was then called, in 1994 as a wholesale broker with just <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18c876d1-3c9f-45c1-8860-8f4262093575\">three people</a>. It now has an underwriting arm and a data analytics business as well as the core insurance broking operations.</p><p>Source: Ian Smith, Insurance Correspondent 2021 'UK insurance broker Howden steps up challenge to rivals with its biggest acquisition ' FT.com 13 October.
