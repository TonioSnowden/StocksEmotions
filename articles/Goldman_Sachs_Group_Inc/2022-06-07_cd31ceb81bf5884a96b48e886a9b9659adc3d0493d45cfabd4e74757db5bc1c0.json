  "text": "<p>The head of Trafigura has warned that the oil market could reach a “parabolic state” this year with prices surging to record highs and triggering a slowdown in economic growth.</p> <p>Jeremy Weir, chief executive of the commodity trader, said that energy markets were in a “critical” state as sanctions on Russia's oil exports following its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/war-in-ukraine\">invasion of Ukraine</a> had exacerbated already tight supplies created by years of under-investment.</p> <p>“We have got a critical situation,” Weir told the FT Global Boardroom conference on Tuesday. “I really think we have a problem for the next six months . . . once it gets to these parabolic states, markets can move and they can spike quite a lot.”</p> <p>A parabolic move in markets is generally defined as when a price that has been rising suddenly surges to hitherto unseen levels, mimicking the right side of a parabolic curve.</p> <p>Weir added it was highly probable that oil prices could rise to $150 a barrel or higher in the coming months, with supply chains strained as Russia tries to redirect its oil exports away from Europe. </p> <p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, which is trading near $120 a barrel, hit an all-time peak of $147 on the eve of the financial crisis in 2008.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/trafigura\">Trafigura</a> executive was the latest to warn that the economy has not yet seen the worst of the energy crisis, with little way of lowering prices as already-squeezed global supplies are likely to get scarcer if Russian production falls further.</p> <p>Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chief executive, warned last week that prices could reach $150 or $175 a barrel this year. Analysts at Goldman Sachs are forecasting oil could average more than $140 a barrel in the third quarter, when the US summer driving season is at its peak.</p> <p>Weir said the rising price of other commodities, including metals such as copper and lithium, was also likely to weigh on global economic growth and could ultimately trigger a slowdown to curb demand.</p> <p>“If we see very high energy prices for a period of time we will eventually see demand destruction,” he said. “It will be problematic to sustain these levels and continue global growth.”</p> <p>Russian oil production had already declined by as much as 1.3mn barrels a day — or more than 1 per cent of global demand — with the country's output of refined products of diesel and gasoline also falling by a similar amount, Weir said.</p> <p>There are risks Russia's production will fall further after Europe agreed last month to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e62a1ef1-22d9-4591-bda4-0a0d5e5f6c15\">bar seaborne imports of Russian oil</a> and a looming ban on vessels carrying Russian oil from accessing EU and UK insurance markets. </p> <p>Saudi Arabia led the Opec+ alliance in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb130bb9-4b75-4626-961a-2c1ed9b0e7f9\">agreeing to accelerate oil production</a> increases slightly last week, but prices have continued to rise. </p> <p>Trafigura was the biggest exporter of seaborne crude cargoes from Russia's state-backed oil champion Rosneft before the invasion of Ukraine. </p> <p>Russia previously represented 6 per cent of Trafigura's global business, Weir said, adding that the company had largely wound up its dealings in the country.</p> <p>Trafigura was only lifting a “limited” amount of permitted refined products from Russia, having ceased all trading in Russian crude. Its investment in Rosneft's vast Vostok oil project in the Russian Arctic remained “frozen”.</p> <p>Weir said there was little sign of a slowdown in oil demand despite <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/792171d7-ae3c-469c-bac6-295fd217bd57\">diesel and gasoline prices</a> already reaching record levels due to tight refining capacity globally, as the economy is still growing strongly while consumers have savings after coronavirus lockdowns.</p> <p>The decommissioning of old refineries and a lack of investment in new capacity meant refined products had to be shipped much further to reach customers. The loss of supplies from Russia, a large refiner that used to sell a large volume of diesel to Europe, was making the situation particularly acute.</p> <p>“The barrels have to move a lot greater distances, it's far less efficient than it was before and it's problematic,” he said.</p><p>Source: David Sheppard and Tom Wilson in London 2022 'Trafigura warns oil prices could reach ‘parabolic state' in threat to economy' FT.com 7 June.
