  "text": "<p>US stock markets hit record highs on Thursday ahead of Friday's keenly watched labour market report which will help set the path of monetary policies that have shored up markets during the pandemic.</p> <p>The blue-chip S&amp;P 500 rose 0.3 per cent, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite edged up 0.1 per cent, both record highs.</p> <p>Economists polled by Bloomberg expect that Friday's non-farm payrolls report, a monthly data release scrutinised by traders, will show US employers added 725,000 jobs in August. </p> <p>Anything around this level is “something that markets would be comfortable with”, said Sebastian Mackay, Invesco multi-asset fund manager, as it would support a popular narrative that the US economy is recovering strongly from the pandemic at the same time that the nation's central bank is willing to continue its crisis-era stimulus. </p> <p>Analysts have also noted that the unemployment rate will continue to fall as pandemic-related stimulus comes to a halt. The unemployment rate in the US reached 5.4 per cent in July, with Bloomberg-polled economists predicting it would continue its downward trend to 5.2 per cent in August.</p> <p>But a miss on those US jobs numbers would spark fears of stagflation, added Mackay, as investors worry that, alongside the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19, wages increases will fuel price rises. US consumer price inflation steadied at a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8a2ad340-5ecf-4aa5-be35-aa7f528c8b83\">13-year high</a> in July, while one in five states reported<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebb4128b-f35c-42db-99d7-63948e0472ca\">&#xa0;record levels</a> of Covid-19 hospitalisations in August.</p> <p>“Market moves since June are consistent with downgrades to growth expectations in the US, Europe and particularly China,” strategists at Goldman Sachs commented, as investors expected the economic boost from industries reopening to fade while supply chain bottlenecks made inflation likely to linger for longer. </p> <p>Investors have hedged their bets in recent weeks by topping up their holdings in companies viewed as relatively insulated from slowdowns, such as tech and healthcare groups. </p> <p>“When you have fears about growth, tech stocks usually show up as a means of defence,” said Patrick Spencer, vice-chair of equities at RW Baird, particularly after these stay-at-home businesses <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/693266a9-3696-4f88-819d-3be73fab2cc3\">thrived</a> through last year's lockdowns. </p> <p>In Europe, the continent's tech subsector is up more than 13 per cent so far this quarter, outperforming the broader Stoxx 600 benchmark, which has risen 4.8 per cent for the same period, having climbed 0.3 per cent on Thursday. </p> <p>London's FTSE 100 closed up 0.2 per cent, while Frankfurt's Xetra Dax and the CAC 40 in Paris both edged up 0.1 per cent. </p> <p>The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which moves inversely to its price and is sensitive to perceived changes in the future path of interest rates, dipped 0.01 percentage points to 1.29 per cent. Germany's equivalent Bund yield fell by 0.01 percentage points to minus 0.39 per cent. </p> <p>The dollar index, which measures the US currency against six peers, was down 0.2 per cent. The euro gained 0.3 per cent to $1.187. Sterling added 0.5 per cent to $1.383. </p> <p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 1.6 per cent to $72.76 a barrel after Opec and its allies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b7be2f2-c2d5-482b-8218-de726f953c59\">agreed on Wednesday</a> to pump an extra 400,000 barrels a day each month between now and late 2022 in a sign of optimism about future demand. </p> <p>“Opec+ went ahead with its planned supply hike . . . as demand is seen to be improving,” said analysts at Citigroup. “However, we expect the group to remain vigilant at each upcoming meeting amid demand uncertainty.” </p><p>Source: Naomi Rovnick in London and Shubham Saharan in New York  2021 'Wall Street stocks hit highs ahead of US jobs report' FT.com 2 September.
