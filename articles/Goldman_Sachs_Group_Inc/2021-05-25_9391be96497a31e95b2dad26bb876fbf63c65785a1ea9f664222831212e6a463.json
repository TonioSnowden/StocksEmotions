This time, it's not <strong>David Cameron</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21c5a22f-f1e6-4a5d-8d89-a69f63bb7ab0\">reputation</a> or <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cac83f5-9631-45ae-8080-586a6bc90d55\">investment funds</a>, but <strong>Aigis Banca</strong>, a speciality Italian lender, that has found itself entangled in the crisis involving the supply-chain finance firm.</p> <p>Milan-based <strong>Aigis</strong>, which is backed by the private equity firm <strong>Metric Capital Partners</strong>, has collapsed into liquidation because of its exposure to Greensill and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b56416b2-340d-4866-9c79-6341a9c9f904\">embattled metals magnate</a> <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong>.</p> <p>Aigis's collapse could have caused “severe social and economic consequences” were it not for its peer <strong>Banca Ifis</strong>'s agreement to buy its assets and liabilities for €1, according to the Ifis chief executive <strong>Frederik Geertman</strong>. Ifis stressed that Greensill-related securities weren't part of the deal.</p> <p>The main issue: Aigis had bought receivables-backed notes, linked to Gupta's metals empire, from Greensill, DD's Rob Smith and Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c02a6e97-5505-4d4a-933f-a0e934ca6eda\">report</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>These were covered by insurance policies — but they are yet to pay out, people familiar with the matter said.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's not Aigis's only connection to Gupta. The metals tycoon had tried to buy a stake in the bank, which was previously called <strong>GBM Banca </strong>and renamed last year, at a time when his own UK bank <strong>Wyelands</strong> was coming under <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c76487e-1119-4a36-9038-89d52fa0ea3b\">increasing scrutiny</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>A couple more Gupta updates for DD readers following the story closely:&#xa0;</p> <ul>  <li><p>The governor of the <strong>Bank of England </strong>has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6f7b70d-a3aa-49dd-82ca-1ab5b8724823\">revealed</a> that Gupta's Wyelands bank was under scrutiny from the <strong>National Crime Agency</strong> and the <strong>Serious Fraud Office</strong>;</p></li>  <li><p>Gupta's UK steel business transferred part of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ef3dd66-4b63-41bc-91b9-e3c97e9b5cff\">£7m taxpayer loan</a> given to a struggling Scottish plant to elsewhere in his empire;</p></li>  <li><p>Gupta has put three of his UK steel plants <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c4ca0be-ffe7-401f-8568-1f8dba21f8fd\">up for sale</a> and held talks with Credit Suisse about a possible debt standstill deal.</p></li> </ul> <p>It's hard to know where the aftershocks of the Greensill saga will strike next. But it's worth keeping an eye on UK business secretary<strong> Kwasi Kwarteng</strong>'s evidence to MPs on the House of Commons business, energy and industrial strategy committee <a href=\"https://committees.parliament.uk/event/4541/formal-meeting-oral-evidence-session/\">today</a>.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h2>Did you hear about the Morgans?&#xa0;</h2> <p>Whenever <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> chief executive <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> is asked about when he will step down from his role, the usual response has been “five years”.&#xa0;</p> <p>But as time goes on, the answer remains the same. It has become something of a joke on Wall Street.&#xa0;</p> <p>Needless to say, we have little clarity on when Dimon actually plans to step down from the throne. But we are getting a better idea of who will be in line to take over when the time comes.&#xa0;</p> <p>Last week JPMorgan named the longtime bankers <strong>Marianne Lake</strong> and <strong>Jennifer Piepszak</strong> as co-heads of its consumer and community banking unit — the bank's largest in terms of revenue.</p> <p>They'll be taking over from one of Dimon's top lieutenants <strong>Gordon Smith, </strong>who steps down at the end of the year. It's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e31d7a7-4911-493b-919d-31e04d756438\">a clear sign</a> that both women are among the top candidates to succeed Dimon. But we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves.&#xa0;</p> <p>The truth is that Dimon doesn't plan to step down any time soon. The longtime CEO, who last year underwent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/68c242a3-87ce-4db6-9a39-611ac0fdcaf8\">emergency heart surgery</a>, has been asked to stick around for a “significant number of additional years” by JPM's board, insiders told the FT's Joshua Franklin and Stephen Morris. That could mean anywhere between five and seven years.</p> <p>A lot can happen in that time, including new contenders for the most-prized job on Wall Street.</p> <p><strong>Teresa Heitsenrether</strong>, who oversees security services, and <strong>Troy Rohrbaugh</strong>, who leads the trading operation, are still in the running. Both are seen as rising stars within JPMorgan's ranks, according to a person briefed on the matter.</p> <p>And don't forget about <strong>Bill Demchak</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2541c590-cba4-4240-b67d-0916dfc122d1\">hyper-ambitious head</a> of <strong>PNC Financial</strong> who bought <strong>BBVA</strong>'s US business at the end of last year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42a97547-d857-465d-afd3-7f5b7c9c4d74\">for $11.6bn</a>. DD sources still think he's a very likely wild card when it comes to the succession game (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0f55186-f5bf-4fbb-b5c8-a0a5131cb5e8\">as we told you</a> a while back).&#xa0;</p> <p>Not to be outdone, <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> kicked off a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/248cbea8-6dbe-4c97-b194-e68dbe121d1f\">succession showdown</a> of its own last week with CEO <strong>James Gorman</strong> making a series of management shake-ups. He promoted two top deputies, <strong>Ted Pick</strong> and <strong>Andy Saperstein</strong>, to be co-presidents.</p> <p>Wall Street will need to choose its horses wisely. As the FT's Lex column <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aae17d2f-4fbb-4805-bef0-2d9c5691d31d\">points out</a>, the new generation of banking bosses will face serious challenges from financial technology groups and powerful private capital institutions encroaching on their turf.&#xa0;</p> <p>While succession chatter was the talk of Wall Street last week, observers will turn their heads towards something new: the ways in which the next-gen group, having moved closer to the limelight, will begin to use their increasingly valuable political capital.&#xa0;</p> <h2>From prison to espionage: Tom Hayes' next move</h2> <p><strong>Tom Hayes</strong>, the trader convicted of rigging the Libor rate in 2015, spent five and a half years in prison. Now he's out, and he's reinventing himself — as a corporate spook.&#xa0;</p> <p>The former <strong>UBS</strong> and <strong>Citigroup </strong>banker <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5efe99ee-b11a-429f-810d-93571bf78369\">is joining</a> a new corporate espionage outfit set up by <strong>Seth Freedman</strong>, a former operative at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/489dcdb5-2ffe-4868-a71a-30db67f93322\">controversial corporate intelligence firm</a> <strong>Black Cube</strong>.</p> <p>Founded in 2011 by veterans of the Israeli intelligence agency <strong>Mossad</strong>, the group has been enlisted by wealthy patrons including the disgraced movie mogul <strong>Harvey Weinstein</strong>.</p> <p>(Dive deeper into the industry with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/641d2ad8-b122-42d5-9562-e6aec03ddb36\">this</a> DD take on <strong>Hakluyt</strong>, the London-based private intelligence firm founded by a band of MI6 officers.)</p> <p>Hayes says the “new skills” he learnt in prison while fighting to overturn his conviction will help him in the job at Freedman's new corporate intelligence agency, <strong>Red Mist</strong>. He'll work as a consultant while separately continuing his own legal battle.&#xa0;</p> <p>In his new role, Hayes is going to focus on financial wrongdoing. Despite having been locked up for years, Hayes seems to have understood an important phenomenon: private spying is having a moment.&#xa0;</p> <p>Side note: one of the brokers cleared of helping Hayes rig the Libor rate,<strong> Danny Wilkinson</strong>, worked for <strong>Raidne</strong>, a company that sells “surveillance algorithms to monitor market manipulation and market abuse”, after his acquittal.&#xa0;</p> <p>But, at least according to his<strong> LinkedIn </strong>page, his career has since taken a different turn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Wilkinson, who also DJs in a house music collective that performs in lab coats, is now . . . a wine taster.&#xa0;</p> <p>Cheers to new beginnings.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>SoftBank</strong>'s vice-chair<strong> Ron Fisher</strong>, who oversaw much of the Japanese group's $10bn-plus investment in<strong> WeWork</strong>, and its first female director<strong> Yuko Kawamoto </strong>are leaving the company's board in a major shake-up.
