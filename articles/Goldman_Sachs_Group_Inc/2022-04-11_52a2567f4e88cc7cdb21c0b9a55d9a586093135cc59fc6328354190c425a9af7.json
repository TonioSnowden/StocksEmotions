  "text": "<p>The Nasdaq's fall builds on last week's 3.9% retreat after Federal Reserve officials signaled their intent to raise borrowing costs and shrink the central bank's balance sheet to quell inflation. Many tech stocks are valued based on expectations of growth far into the future and so are especially sensitive to rising rates.</p><p>Political uncertainty in Europe and economic risks stemming from China's Covid-19 shutdowns were adding to investor anxiety after a bumpy start to 2022 for stocks. Bond yields have surged on the prospect of tighter monetary policy set by the Fed. The war in Ukraine, which is entering a new phasein the east of the country, has boosted commodity prices, adding to inflationary pressures.</p><p>U.S. government bonds extended their selloff. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 2.778%, from 2.713% Friday. Yields, which move in the opposite direction as bond prices, have climbed for four of the past five weeks.</p><p>Lockdowns in Shanghai weighed on oil prices, sending benchmark Brent crude contracts down 4.6% to $98.06 a barrel. The physical oil market had been weakening for several weeks in response to the shutdowns as well a planned release from strategic reserves in the U.S. and elsewhere.</p><p>Adding to the pressure, refiners in Turkey and elsewhere have continued to buy Russian crude, reducing demand for northwest European oil, said Helge André Martinsen, senior oil analyst at DNB Markets.</p><p>Investors are preparing to get their next deep look into corporate performance as earnings season kicks off in earnest this week. With inflation raising the costs of everything from energy to labor, investors will scour company results for signs of how businesses are coping.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase, BlackRock and Delta Air Lines are due to report Wednesday, followed by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Thursday.</p><p>Among individual stocks, Twitter shares rose 1.3% after the company's chief executive said Elon Musk had decided not to join the board. Shares of Tesla, where Mr. Musk is chief executive, fell 4%.</p><p>AT&amp;T, which on Friday completed the planned merger of its film-and-TV empire with Discovery, rose 7.2%. Shares of the new company, Warner Bros. Discovery, dropped 1.9%.</p><p>Stock markets mostly fell overseas. The Stoxx Europe 600 lost 0.6%. Shares of Société Générale rose 5% after the French lender said it was selling its entire stake in Rosbank and its Russian insurance units to Interros, a conglomerate controlled by metals billionaire Vladimir Potanin.</p><p>Stocks in China tumbled as the economic toll of Covid-19 lockdowns in Shanghai and supply-chain disruptions in the country continued to mount. The CSI 300 Index, which tracks the largest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, fell 3.1%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dropped 3%.</p><p>\"Resurgence of the pandemic is the major reason,\" said Bruce Pang, head of macro strategy research for China Renaissance Securities. He said investors have been hoping for measures from Beijing to help counter the effects of the slowdown.</p><p>Chinese auto sales data on Monday showed that passenger-car sales fell 10.5% in March, after production was hampered by factory closures. Shanghai, the center of the Covid-19 outbreak, reported more than 25,000 asymptomatic carriers of coronavirus Sunday, according to the National Health Commission.</p><p>Hong Kong-listed shares of NIO slid 11%.
