  "text": "<p>Deal-hungry buyout groups are hunting for targets across the investment industry with Blackstone, KKR, General Atlantic, Stone Point and Thomas H Lee all acquiring asset management or wealth businesses in the past 12 months.</p> <p>The value of deals involving asset and wealth managers jumped to $38.9bn last year, almost triple the previous year, according to Piper Sandler, the Minneapolis-based investment bank.</p> <p>Reverence Capital Partners, a little known player, this year emerged as a forceful new competitor after it clinched the biggest deal so far involving an asset management and private equity. Reverence and GTCR, a Chicago-based private equity manager, in February agreed to buy the $603bn asset management arm of Wells Fargo for $2.1bn. </p> <p>“The Wells Fargo acquisition brings private equity into new territory in terms of the scale of their ambitions in asset management,” says Aaron Dorr, a principal at Piper Sandler. </p> <p>New York-based Reverence, which was founded in 2013 by Goldman Sachs alumni Milton Berlinski, Peter Aberg and Alex Chulack is keen to win more deals.</p> <p>“In spite of the headwinds from fee pressure and the shift from active to passive, asset management is a sector with attractive long-term prospects, particularly if you are a scale player,” says Berlinski.</p> <p>But the modest $2.1bn sale price, a valuation that represented just 0.3 per cent of WFAM's assets, has prompted talk among industry observers that Reverence and GTCR bought a lemon unwanted by other suitors.</p> <p>Berlinski rejects this description. “There are very few moments when a business of this size become available. We think we paid a fair price.</p> <p>He asserts that WFAM has a “quality management team, a strong culture and very good investment performance”. </p> <p>Below the radar, Reverence has participated in a range of deals involving Russell Investments, Victory Capital, Vida Capital, Oak Hill Advisors as well as the acquisitions of Advisor Group and Ladenburg Thalmann, two wealth management platforms. </p> <p>Including WFAM, the stable of managers owned outright or partly controlled by Reverence now oversee close to $2tn of assets.</p> <p>Private equity managers are also encouraging investment firms which they have acquired to pursue bolt on deals, creating a second layer of M&amp;A activity.</p> <p>Texas-based Victory Capital has developed into a $147bn multi-boutique with 10 franchises after completing multiple acquisitions with the backing of Reverence, including deals with Munder Capital Management, RS Investments, USAA and THB Asset Management.</p> <p>Reverence retained a 14.4 per cent stake after Victory floated on the Nasdaq exchange in 2018. Its share price has since more than doubled.</p> <p>“We encourage portfolio companies to pursue M&amp;A when it is appropriate. Smaller managers find it difficult and costly to access distribution. Bringing the franchises together on a shared platform means that Victory now delivers one of the best profit margins in the asset management industry,” says Berlinski. Victory's net income more than doubled to $213m last year even though it registered net outflows of $19.4bn in 2020.</p> <p>M&amp;A activity across the highly fragmented US wealth management has been running at a frenetic pace for the last three years, driven by private equity groups. </p> <p>“Wealth management has very attractive characteristics for private equity buyers. Client numbers are increasing for wealth managers and client loyalty tends to be very strong with a 90 per cent annual retention rate,” says Dorr. </p> <p>Reverence bought Advisor Group in 2019, then a platform of four wealth management businesses with combined assets of $272bn. Three months later, Advisor bought Ladenburg Thalmann in a deal worth $1.3bn, including debt. </p> <p>Founded in 1876 as an investment bank, Ladenburg Thalmann's activities have expanded to include wealth management, insurance and brokerage services. </p> <p>Together Advisor and Ladenburg Thalmann employ 11,500 financial advisers and oversee more than $450bn in client assets. </p> <p>“We have created one of the most robust wealth management platforms in the country to support advisers growth by combining these two firms,” says Berlinski, a veteran of more than 250 deals over a 26-year career at Goldman. </p> <p>The deal has also created a new competitor to Wall Street's so-called wirehouses, the brokerage and wealth management platforms run by Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, UBS and Wells Fargo.&#xa0;</p> <p>Dorr adds that “wealth managers can be combined without interruptions to the core business of serving clients. That is more difficult in asset management deals”. </p> <p>Since it was launched, Reverence and its co-investors have committed a total of $5.4bn, raising two private equity funds and a structured credit fund. It plans to launch a third private equity fund this year which will again target financial services companies. </p><p>Source: Chris Flood 2021 'Buyout groups fuel investment sector M&amp;A' FT.com 28 March.
