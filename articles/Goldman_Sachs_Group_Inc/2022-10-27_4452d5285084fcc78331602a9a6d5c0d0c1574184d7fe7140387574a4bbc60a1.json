  "title": "Credit Suisse Names New Compliance Chief Amid Strategic Overhaul; Nita Patel will succeed Rafael Lopez Lorenzo, who is stepping down after about a year at the post for family reasons",
  "text": "<p>Ms. Patel joined Credit Suisse in May 2021 as a chief compliance officer for its international division. Before that, she spent 18 years at Goldman Sachs, including serving as its head of asset-management compliance in London.</p><p>Ms. Patel has played an important role in helping with the compliance changes that Mr. Lopez Lorenzo started, including building and strengthening compliance functions, the bank's chief executive Ulrich KÃ¶rner said in a statement.</p><p>Representatives for Credit Suisse and Ms. Patel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Lopez Lorenzo didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Mr. Lopez Lorenzo took over the compliance post last year as the bank continued to manage the fallout over losses tied to the collapse of Archegos Capital Management and the insolvency of another key client, Greensill Capital, earlier last year. He will be appointed as a nonexecutive member of its board in Spain, Credit Suisse said.</p><p>The appointment comes as the Swiss bank plans to cut thousands of jobs and raise around $4 billion in capital to shrink its Wall Street deal making and trading and attempts to recover from a near-existential crisis. The result will be a leaner bank with around 9,000 fewer employees in three years, with a first wave of cuts involving 2,700 people being let go now.</p><p>Write to Mengqi Sun at mengqi.sun@wsj.com</p><p>Credit Suisse Names New Compliance Chief Amid Strategic Overhaul</p>",
