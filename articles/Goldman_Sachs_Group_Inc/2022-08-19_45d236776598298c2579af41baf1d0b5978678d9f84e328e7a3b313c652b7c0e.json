The FT sent him to try to get to the bottom of the corporate upheaval at <strong>F45 Training</strong>, an international chain backed by the Hollywood movie star <strong>Mark Wahlberg</strong>.</p> <p>F45 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/374dacb3-b9f7-4848-9d27-8053c349e5d5\">had a great coronavirus pandemic</a>. At a time when other gyms were going bust, Wahlberg's company opened hundreds of new locations; by the end of last year it had 1,800 gyms in dozens of countries and had signed agreements to open 1,500 more.</p> <p>But just as the broader gym industry is recovering, F45 has hit a wall. Its share price, which exceeded $17 a year ago, has recently fallen as low as $1.35. Chief executive <strong>Adam Gilchrist </strong>resigned last month, and the company announced it was firing most of its workforce and cutting by about two-thirds the number of new gyms it expects to open this year.</p> <p>To find out why, you need to read <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e3ca61a-1138-48ca-a69d-6e3a197777eb\">this FT deep dive</a> from Thursday. In short, F45 is a franchise business that makes a significant chunk of money from fees it charges new gym operators before they even open their doors — and with credit conditions now tightening, some local gym operators are finding it harder to raise cash.</p> <p>The story underscores how businesses that thrived on cheap capital during the pandemic are facing painful adjustments as inflation bites and central banks raise rates.</p> <p>Speaking of painful adjustments, Vandevelde reckons the instructor's generous assessment had it backwards. Forty-five minutes in a gym, he tells us ruefully, crushed him.</p> <h1>Oxford Street's sugar rush</h1> <p>In <strong>Westminster City Council</strong>'s basement, hundreds of Wonka chocolate bars are piled up, tagged and bound in plastic evidence bags.</p> <p>The stockpile is part of a haul of hundreds of thousands of counterfeit candy items and souvenirs seized by investigators in recent raids from Europe's busiest shopping street.</p> <p>They're also a sign of a larger problem: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/534dc8ab-d8f3-4f6d-bfca-e817c03655f9\">the curious transformation</a> of London's Oxford Street into a commercial strip of American candy shops, the FT's Cynthia O'Murchu, Max Harlow and Dan Clark report.</p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamHug/status/1536967038840750083\">https://twitter.com/AdamHug/status/1536967038840750083</a> <p>The sugary incursion has perplexed locals and tourists alike. Many high street retailers that were pushed out by the shift to ecommerce and<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af165222-b3bf-46dc-8155-09a149f234ca\"> high business rates</a> have been replaced by brightly-lit emporiums hawking American delicacies such as Jolly Ranchers and Sour Patch Kids.</p> <p>In June, the council said it was owed £7.9mn in overdue business rates from 30 sweet and souvenir stores in the area. One reason for the outstanding taxes? The owners of such shops can be notoriously tough to track down.</p> <p>An FT analysis of companies registered at Oxford Street premises revealed clusters of shareholders and directors who appear to form a loose network. Some shared residential or business addresses, or took ownership of a business for months at a time before ceding it to another shareholder. Their finances are a mystery, because most of them have either not filed accounts, or wind up before they do so.</p> <p>At some premises there are multiple layers of leaseholders, tenants and subtenants that separate freeholders from the ultimate occupiers, meaning some freeholders have no control over who opens a business on their property.</p> <p>For the council, the issue goes far deeper than just counterfeit candy.</p> <p>The delinquent sweet stores reflect wider shortcomings in how the government deals with fraud and tax evasion — from a company registration system fraught with loopholes to a disjointed enforcement process that makes it easier for dirty money to flow into the UK.</p> <p>“We are playing whack a mole, trying to tackle the rates evasion,” said <strong>Adam Hug</strong>, leader of Westminster Council. “To go after the root cause we need a cohesive approach between us and central government.”</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/1615102.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The UK's<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7522fe69-f8a7-480c-bd4c-af5f7a266165\"> economic crime bill</a> is attempting to address some of these problems. But moving too quickly to shut down the candy shops would leave Oxford Street full of cavities.</p> <p>Recovering anything resembling the old Oxford Street could be a bitter and drawn-out process.</p> <h1>Meet Asia's godfather of private equity</h1> <p>In December 1997, South Korea was on the brink of default. </p> <p>Its banks and overleveraged conglomerates were on their knees after international creditors suddenly withdrew the short-term financing upon which Korean industry had come to depend.</p> <p><strong>Michael Byung Ju Kim </strong>was working for investment bank<strong> Salomon Brothers </strong>at the time. </p> <p>Born in Korea and educated in the US, he found himself serving as an intermediary during tense negotiations between Wall Street bankers and Korean government officials as they hammered out the details of a crucial long-term refinancing package.</p> <p>A quarter of a century later, Kim carries the moniker of the “Godfather of Asian private equity”.&#xa0;</p> <p>His firm, <strong>MBK Partners</strong>, which he set up in 2005 after he was encouraged by Singapore's First Lady and then chief executive of <strong>Temasek</strong>,<strong> Ho Ching</strong>, to “create an Asian firm, owned and operated by Asians, for Asia”, is sitting on $25.6bn of assets under management — an annual increase of 29 per cent since it was founded. </p> <p>The rise of MBK <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ba55806-2899-4c1f-9244-9c5b8b29eb58\">illustrates the dramatic growth in scale and sophistication</a> of the South Korean private equity market in the decades since the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, as the FT's Christian Davies writes.</p> <p>South Korea had rebounded from the Asian financial crisis so quickly that the country paid off its 15-year loans within two years. The crisis also forced radical restructuring on the surviving Korean conglomerates, creating opportunities for carve-outs and growth.</p> <p>Powered by South Korea's mighty <strong>National Pension Service</strong>, local players have emerged to compete with established global private equity firms.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/10923891.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>In 2021, South Korea's private equity deal value doubled to a record high of almost $30bn, exceeding neighbouring Japan by about $2bn and trailing only China and India in terms of total deal value in the region, according to estimates by<strong> Bain &amp; Company</strong>. </p> <p>While global investors tend to focus on the potential carve-ups of Japanese titans such as <strong>Toshiba</strong>, financiers in east Asia note the steady pipeline of deals involving medium-sized Korean companies in sectors ranging from consumer goods, infrastructure and manufacturing to ecommerce, fintech and software.</p> <p>Kim describes it as the “Goldilocks country”: lower risk than China, with higher growth than Japan. </p> <p>“Korea has assumed disproportionate importance as a buyout market in the last few years,” says <strong>Iain Drayton</strong>, head of<strong> Goldman Sachs</strong>' investment banking division in Asia ex-Japan. “It's one of the best-kept secrets in Asia.”</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The superannuation and pension fund <strong>AustralianSuper</strong> has hired<strong> Jennie Rose </strong>as senior investment director of private debt and <strong>Aaron Witte </strong>as a senior portfolio manager of private equity. They join its New York office from insurer<strong> Barings</strong> and private equity firm <strong>SwanCap Partners</strong>, respectively.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Citigroup </strong>has promoted <strong>Aveline San</strong> to lead its operations in Hong Kong and Macau,&#xa0; replacing <strong>Angel Ng</strong>, who was named Citi's Asia head of global wealth in April.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Yahoo </strong>has appointed <strong>Jen Rubio</strong>, co-founder and chief of luggage brand <strong>Away</strong>, to its board of directors. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> has hired<strong> Louisa Cobbe </strong>as a partner in its London office. She joins from <strong>Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Bucked by the bull </strong>Three months after the retirement of its swashbuckling star tech investor James Anderson, Baillie Gifford is grappling with an uncertain future as the so-called Oracle of Edinburgh's bets <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-08-18/tesla-amazon-visionary-leaves-uk-fund-firm-baillie-gifford-down-100-billion#xj4y7vzkg\">begin to sour</a>, Bloomberg reports.</p> <p><strong>Shipwrecked </strong>When Su Zhu and Kyle Davies put in the order for their $150mn superyacht, it was the largest that boat maker Sanlorenzo had ever sold.
