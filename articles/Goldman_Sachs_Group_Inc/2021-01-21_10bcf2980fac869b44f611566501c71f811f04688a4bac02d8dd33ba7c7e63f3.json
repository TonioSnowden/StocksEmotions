  "title": "The Inauguration:  New Environmental Rules Loom  ----  By Timothy Puko",
  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- Businesses prepared for an era of stricter regulation as President Biden ordered a review of dozens of environmental policies -- foreshadowing more stringent efficiency requirements for auto makers and appliance manufacturers, new limits on mining and drilling on federal lands and tougher emissions standards for power plants. </p><p>   The actions were aimed at reversing former President Donald Trump's deregulatory push in environmental regulation, prompting optimism among many executives backing renewable technologies, but irking others. </p><p>   Fossil-fuel companies are likely to be among Mr. Biden's biggest opponents. Mike Sommers, president and chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, used his annual address last week to strike a conciliatory tone at times, saying it wanted to work with Mr. Biden on emissions limits and trade policy. </p><p>   But he also said the group would aggressively defend the industry on core interests, especially access to federal lands and offshore oil. </p><p>   \"The bottom line for us is that we are going to work with the Biden administration when we can, but we will oppose them when we must,\" Mr. Sommers said. \"We will do everything we can to fight for the oil-and-gas industry across the United States.\" </p><p>   Mr. Biden's first-day agenda included revoking a permit granted by Mr. Trump to allow developers of the Keystone XL pipeline to extend it across the U.S.-Canada border. </p><p>   The project developer, TC Energy Corp., blasted the decision, saying it overturns \"an unprecedented, comprehensive regulatory process that lasted more than a decade and repeatedly concluded the pipeline would transport much needed energy in an environmentally responsible way.\" The company added: \"The action would directly lead to the layoff of thousands of union workers and negatively impact groundbreaking industry commitments.\" </p><p>   But Keystone's position -- once a standard bearer for heavy industry in opposition to the environmental movement -- isn't as common in the business world as it once was. Many corporate titans are now acting on climate change, reducing their greenhouse-gas emissions and asking for government support, a boost to Mr. Biden's agenda. </p><p>   Leading business and trade groups were among those expressing hope that Mr. Biden's conciliatory tone and promise of bipartisan problem-solving will reduce congressional gridlock and help nurture new technologies. </p><p>   \"I understand how poisonous the atmosphere is, with everything that's happened in the last few weeks. But there is an opportunity here,\" said Marty Durbin, who leads the energy arm of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \"We do have a chance to make significant progress across all of our policy priorities.\" </p><p>   The Chamber this week embraced the potential for market-based solutions, such as carbon taxes, to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, joining several major business groups that in recent months have said Congress needs to act. </p><p>   After years of fighting these proposals, many businesses now support government action to address climate change, and are pushing for swift clarity on what those actions might be. </p><p>   The Chamber supports the re-entry of the U.S. into the Paris agreement as a way to ensure U.S. global leadership and its place in international negotiations, Mr. Durbin said. There are economic and trade risks otherwise, he added, noting NextDecade Corp.'s recent loss of a multibillion-dollar gas contract under reported pressure from the French government. </p><p>   Many companies share that position, especially electric utilities and technology companies. </p><p>   \"U.S. re-entry into the Paris agreement will send an important signal to all sectors of the economy that the country intends to meet the objectives as outlined in the pact,\" Duke Energy Corp. Chief Executive Lynn Good said in a statement. </p><p>   Corporations including Dow Chemical Co. and Microsoft Corp., as well as the heads of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, had urged Mr. Trump not to leave the pact in the first place. They have pressed for U.S. government support at a time when consumers and financiers want them to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions, and states and other countries are enforcing their own rules. </p><p>   Mr. Biden's lengthy lists of actions on the first day show these companies can now expect that support from their own federal government, said Michelle Patron, senior director of sustainability policy at Microsoft. </p><p>   It has its own corporate goal of not just zeroing out its emissions, but to start removing more emissions from the atmosphere than it produces by 2030. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ben Foldy, Katherine Blunt and Vipal Monga contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
