They also foresee the reduction of the Fed's more than $8 trillion balance sheet beginning in the third quarter, or after two rate hikes are delivered.</p><p>Economists at Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, also expect four rate increases in 2022, instead of their previous call for three, and say a runoff in the balance sheet will commence in July instead of December. “Declining labor market slack has made Fed officials more sensitive to upside inflation risks and less sensitive to downside growth risks,” they said in a note to clients.</p><p>Some strategists are adopting a much more sanguine view of the market's outlook, despite the eminent tightening of financial conditions.</p><p>“While the next few months may be challenging and markets volatile, with each COVID wave both the public and risk markets are becoming more resilient,” wrote Seema Shah, chief strategist&#xa0;at Principal Global Investors, in a Monday note.</p><p>“Progress toward vaccinations should ensure the latest wave doesn't significantly intensify supply chain bottlenecks. In turn, the most acute upward price pressures are still expected to ease through 2022,” the strategist said.</p><p>Later in the week, investors will watch the confirmation hearing of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, followed by one for Lael Brainard, the Fed governor who has been nominated to become the central bank's No. 2 after Vice Chairman Richard Clarida steps down.</p><p>An eagerly awaited inflation report on consumers is due on Wednesday and a report on U.S. retail sales will be closely followed on Friday.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Lululemon AthleticaLULU warned fourth-quarter earnings and revenue would be at the low end of its target, citing the impact of the omicron variant on capacity and staff.
