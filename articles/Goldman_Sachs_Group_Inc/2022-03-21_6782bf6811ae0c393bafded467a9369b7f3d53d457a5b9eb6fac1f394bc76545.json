  "title": "War in Ukraine Tests Faith in Emerging Markets; Investors were already reckoning with underwhelming emerging-markets performance over the past decade",
  "text": "<p>\"To what extent and at what point do we take into consideration—perhaps it's during the asset allocation study—the risks associated with investing directly outside the United States?\" asked Harry Keiley, board chair of the California State Teachers' Retirement System, at an investment committee meeting earlier this month.</p><p>Emerging-markets stocks returned 3.3% on an annualized basis over the past 10 years as of March 17, compared with 11.1% for global equities and 12.1% for U.S. midsize companies, according to indexes from MSCI and S&amp;P Global.</p><p>Meanwhile, emerging-markets bonds averaged annual returns of 4% over the past 10 full years and 2022 so far, compared with 6.1% for a portfolio of U.S. high-yield bonds, according to indexes operated by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bloomberg Inc.</p><p>\"The call on emerging markets outperforming has been disappointing,\" said Hayley Tran, co-head of equity research at Meketa Investment Group, a consultant to public pension plans and other institutional investors. \"Both the earnings growth and the returns have not delivered…not to the extent we expected.\"</p><p>Developed-country stocks and bonds have outstripped emerging markets because they benefited more from the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy, said Allianz SE economist Mohamed El-Erian, a former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund. Developing countries also faced deteriorating economic fundamentals, he said.</p><p>Investors bought into emerging-markets bond mutual funds for most of the past decade—putting in about $55 billion in 2019—but they withdrew about $4 billion in 2021 and have pulled $7.3 billion so far this year, according to data from Lipper. Emerging-markets stock funds continue to attract interest, taking in a record $120.5 billion last year and $25 billion in 2022.</p><p>Much of last year's interest came from investors who had previously reduced exposure and were ramping back up to take advantage of some Asian countries' rebound from Covid-19 slowdowns, Ms. Tran said.</p><p>Pension funds around the worldmoved to divestfrom Russian stocks and bonds over the past several weeks, both in an effort to protect against losses and because they didn't want a stake in a country attacking its neighbor. By the time they did so, the value of the investments had plummeted, trading was near-frozen, and Russia's assault on Ukraine was well under way.</p><p>The selloff soon spread to other countries. Emerging-markets bonds have lost about 10% in 2022, according to data from JPMorgan, while the total return on the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, which tracks stocks in emerging economies, is minus 8.7%.</p><p>\"Divestment decisions are often too late,\" Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association investment chief Jonathan Grabel recalled telling board members earlier this month.</p><p>Some institutional investors are trying to reduce indirect exposure to Russia through stock in companies that buy materials or sell products there. McDonald's Corp. and Starbucks Corp. have said they are suspending operations in Russia amid calls from investors and consumers.</p><p>The California State Teachers' Retirement System is among several large investors that have urged companies they hold stock in to shut down Russian operations, according to people familiar with the matter, fearing further losses and uncertainty.</p><p>The Russia-Ukraine war isn't the first time a country's political actions have prompted investors to bail out. Asset managers steered clear of Pakistan in the 2000s after sanctions prompted by a 1998 nuclear test led to losses. Many companies and investors divested from South Africa during the apartheid era.</p><p>Many institutional investors and advisers remain optimistic about developing countries. The nation's largest pension fund, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, started its March 14 investment committee meeting with a panel on emerging markets planned before the Russia-Ukraine war.</p><p>\"Things will go wrong,\" Goldman Sachs Asset Management's Greg Olafson told the fund's board. Even so, he said, \"the opportunity is too large to ignore.\"</p><p>Wilshire Advisors, a consultant to many large pension plans, projected in a December quarterly report that emerging-markets stocks would return 5.5% over the coming decade, a percentage point higher than U.S. equities. Similar projections have helped convince pension funds like the $1.37 billion Kansas City, Mo., employees' retirement system to increase emerging-markets stocks to 11.3% of global equity from 9.5% over the past several years.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How have losses in China and Russia made you re-evaluate the performance of emerging-markets stocks and bonds? Join the conversation below.</p><p>U.S. state and local retirement plans aim to keep a median 6.5% of holdings in emerging-markets equities and 4% in emerging-markets bonds, according to data from the Boston College Center for Retirement Research on plans that report those holdings separately.</p><p>But some retirement fund officials have been pulling back. Philadelphia's $7.5 billion municipal employees' retirement fund about two years ago reduced its target for emerging-markets equity to 3% from 4% of the fund, opting to invest more in other growth assets such as U.S. midsize company stocks.</p><p>\"The board felt we could achieve similar or superior results with less volatility and a lower risk profile,\" chief investment officer Christopher DiFusco said in an email.</p><p>—Emily Glazer contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Heather Gillers at heather.gillers@wsj.com and Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com</p><p>War in Ukraine Tests Faith in Emerging Markets</p>",
