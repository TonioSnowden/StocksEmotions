  "title": "U.S. Stocks Fall After Russia Shells Ukrainian Nuclear Plant; Strong jobs number wasn't enough to lift major indexes",
  "text": "<p>A strong jobs number early Friday wasn't enough to push major indexes higher. Many investors remained focused on Russia'sescalating military campaign and trying to assess how much tough Western sanctions on Russia will damage economic growth. The invasion and rising commodity prices could further stoke inflation at a time when prices have already been at a 40-year high.</p><p>New data on Friday showed that the U.S. added 678,000 jobs in February, more than the 440,000 expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. The Federal Reserve has signaled that it is on track for a quarter-percentage-point interest-rate increase at its March meeting, removing some near-term uncertainty about interest rates.</p><p>\"The jobs report was strong,\" said Amy Kong, chief investment officer at Barrett Asset Management. But \"it doesn't necessarily change the Fed stance,\" she said.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined to 1.721%, down from 1.843% Thursday. Bond yields have swung wildly throughout the week as investors have monitored the Russian invasion, comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and economic data.</p><p>Bitcoin prices slipped to around $40,700 in recent trading.</p><p>Rising oil prices and the prospect of slower economic growth have also pushed investors into traditionally safer investments such as government bonds. Bond yields decline as prices rise. The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index fell 3.5% to trade close to its lowest level in nearly a year, reflecting concerns that Europe will bear the brunt of the economic fallout from the Russia-Ukraine crisis.</p><p>\"The U.S. is less vulnerable to the Russia-Ukraine crisis than what you would see in Europe,\" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. For now, she said, \"The market is looking at [the situation] and saying the U.S. economy is strong.\"</p><p>European bank stocks were hit particularly hard Friday. Société Générale lost around 9.5% after the French lender said Thursday that its exposure to Russia stood at 18.6 billion euros, equivalent to over $20 billion, at the end of 2021. Shares of Italian bank UniCredit tumbled around 13.6%. Meanwhile, Uniper, a major German energy company that is owed about 950 million euros by the Russia-owned company behind the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, fell 12%.</p><p>Friday's moves cap a haywire week for global markets, with giant swings across currencies, commodities and stock markets around the globe. Many traders were scrambling to understand the impact of the sanctions and the subsequent changes made by exchanges and financial firms around the globe.</p><p>The New York Stock Exchange halted trading in three Russia-linked exchange-traded funds, following a similar move with NYSE-listed Russian stocks earlier this week. Russia's central bank kept the Moscow stock market largely closed for a fifth straight day, shielding local shares from a potential selloff.</p><p>The Russian ruble declined again, with the currency down 2.2% against the greenback, trading at 112.53 per U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar gained, with the WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of 16 others, up 0.5% to trade near its highest level since July 2020. Meanwhile, the euro continued its recent fall.</p><p>Global stock, bond, currency and commodity markets have swung significantly this week. A sharp run-up in oil prices, during which West Texas Intermediate crude briefly topped $116 for the first time since 2008, raised concerns about stagflation, a combination of muted economic growth and inflation.</p><p>\"It's beginning to look a little stagflationary,\" said Anwiti Bahuguna, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle. \"We have inflation sticking around longer and growth taking a leg down.\"</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group analysts said Thursday that higher oil and gas prices are the \"key inflation risk for the United States\" and that higher commodity prices threaten economic growth. Each 10% increase in crude oil prices can lower GDP growth, they said, as consumers pull back on spending because of higher gas prices.</p><p>On Friday, front-month futures prices for Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, rose 3% to $113.81 a barrel.</p><p>Russian shelling in southern Ukraine, which caused a fire at a nuclear power plant, intensified fears among investors Friday about Moscow's tactics and concerns about a nuclear disaster. However, officials said the fire didn't affect essential equipment, lessening worries about reactor damage.</p><p>Despite the volatility, stocks in New York have been relatively resilient amid the conflict. All three major U.S. indexes are up 2% or more since Russia invaded Ukraine last week. Yet trading has grown choppier in recent days.</p><p>Shares of Smith &amp; Wesson Brands dropped almost 15% after the gun maker reported that sales fell more than 30% during the holiday quarter. Gap fell about 3% after the clothing retailer reported results that beat expectations.</p><p>Asian stocks dropped, in part reflecting Thursday's actionon Wall Street, where technology stocks sold off more than the broader market and U.S.-listed Chinese companies stumbled.</p><p>Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 2.2% lower Friday. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 2.5%, registering its lowest close since March 2020. In mainland China, the CSI 300 index fell 1.2% to its lowest close since July 2020.</p><p>—Joe Wallace and Alexander Osipovich contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com and Clarence Leong at clarence.leong@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Fall After Russia Shells Ukrainian Nuclear Plant</p>",
