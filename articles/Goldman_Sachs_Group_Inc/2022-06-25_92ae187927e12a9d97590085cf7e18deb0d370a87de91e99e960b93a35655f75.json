  "text": "<p>Seal Press, 405 pages, $30</p><p>In 1912, when Greenwich Village was a haven for artists and writers, a group of politically active women began to meet privately in a MacDougal Street basement restaurant to discuss social reform. They were leading figures of their time, writers, socialites, socialists, artists and scientists -- some whose names are familiar, others not. Their causes are strikingly relevant to those of today: workers' rights, racism, prison reform, sexual freedom, birth control and abortion. The group played a major part in achieving women's right to vote and promoted the idea of a new philosophy: \"feminism.\"</p><p>The women belonged to a club called Heterodoxy. Founded by suffragist Marie Jenney Howe, a biographer of George Sand, it opened with 25 charter members (the numbers eventually rose to around 100. They were white, educated, well-off and outspoken: women who, in the words of Mabel Dodge, a member and leading patron of the arts, \"did things.\" By day they taught, wrote, worked on research projects or attended political demonstrations. By night they held literary salons, acted in plays and addressed union meetings. They bore no resemblance to the flat-footed, frumpy, dour feminists in baggy clothes and thick spectacles satirized in cartoons of the day. Many of them were elegant, narrow-waisted and fashionably turned out in large feathered hats and high heels, their suffrage ribbons fluttering on their scarves like a fashion accessory. Freed from the stifling parlors and beady-eyed chaperones of their youth, they would gather in Village restaurants such as Polly's, where the dining room was in a basement crammed with wooden tables and the dish of the day might be liver and onions, or spaghetti ladled out from a communal bowl.</p><p>In \"Hotbed,\" her meticulously researched and complex social history, Joanna Scutts concentrates on the club's first decade through the early 1920s. (Heterodoxy closed in the 1940s.) It was a turbulent time that saw, among other things, World War I and the passing of the 19th Amendment, which gave American women the right to vote.</p><p>Not much is known about the goings-on inside Heterodoxy. To maintain an open, free-wheeling atmosphere, the club kept no records so that members could speak out on any topic without fear of repercussion. There was one rule: The subject for discussion must be agreed upon in advance. The aim of the meetings was not \"clever conversation\" but organized debate on specific topics, from psychology to labor movements.</p><p>Speakers who lectured at the club were lively and controversial. They included Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger, whose mother had suffered through 18 childbirths, and the Imagist poet Amy Lowell. Emma Goldman addressed the group, unsurprisingly, on \"Anarchy.\" Edith Ellis, the lesbian English writer in an open marriage to the sexologist Havelock Ellis, spoke on \"Love.\"</p><p>Those not well-versed in feminist history might find quite a few of the names in this book obscure. They come in such rapid succession that at times it's hard to keep the scenes in focus. Ms. Scutts delivers brief sketches of members, including the heiress Inez Milholland (the era's equivalent of an \"It\" girl), who was arrested at a demonstration wearing a formal evening gown -- since she'd planned to go to the opera after her picket-line duty. She died young, in 1916, from complications of tonsillitis, a martyr for the cause. Other notable personalities include Charlotte Perkins Gilman, the author of a popular novella, \"The Yellow Wallpaper,\" who compared marriage to prostitution, and birth-control and labor activists Rose Pastor Stokes, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and Crystal Eastman. There was just one black member, antilynching advocate Grace Nail Johnson. (Lynching was not recognized as a federal hate crime until March this year, when the Emmett Till Antilynching Act was finally signed into law.)</p><p>Heterodoxy members defined feminism, rather loosely, as \"both a personal, psychological experience and a question of political rights.\" It was broadly supported by young male radicals who lived in the Village, many of whom were friends with Heterodoxy members and joined in demonstrations. A frequent booster of the feminist cause, Floyd Dell, the editor of an influential socialist magazine The Masses, summed up their position. \"Men are tired of subservient women.\" They wanted \"a comrade and an equal\" because it was fair and also because it promised to be \"more fun.\" He claimed that no man had a right to enjoy his own freedom while \"a woman-slave\" languished in a dungeon underneath his feet. Ms. Scutts points out that at least part of Dell's objection seems to have been a fear of a woman playing the part of \"pretty slave\" only to trap a man into marriage -- a turn that deflates his otherwise firm message of solidarity.</p><p>The question of a woman's role after marriage was of pivotal importance for Heterodoxy members. They became enthusiasts of psychology, a relatively new discipline, and keen followers of Freud. The ideas behind psychoanalysis appeared to support \"everything they had been grasping toward in their intimate relationships: frankness about sexuality, recognition that men and women shared equally intense desires, and rejection of the tight trammeling force of traditional marriage.\" In a short while, Ms. Scutts notes, \"Freudian ideas . . . spread like wildfire through the Village.\" Not surprisingly the most prominent American female psychoanalysts of the day, such as Grace Potter, belonged to Heterodoxy. If only things could be said out loud, women felt, there was a chance for change.</p><p>Many of Heterodoxy's artists and writers spent their summers in the remote fishing village of Provincetown, on Cape Cod. There they drank a great deal of whiskey and talked about creating a new modern type of theater putting on works that commented on psychoanalysis and feminism. In July 1916 they began to stage plays at a warehouse on the dock. Their productions were the antithesis of Broadway commercialism and Victorian drama. They dropped the old declamatory style of speech in favor of a more natural form, and helped launch the career of Eugene O'Neill, who famously introduced realism to the stage. That same year the Provincetown Players established the performance space on MacDougal Street in New York and, in an early break with Broadway's racist practice at the time, African-Americans were cast in a play instead of white actors in blackface.</p><p>Although there were many clubs and political discussion groups in the Village in the early 1900s, most of them lasted only for a year or two. Heterodoxy survived for 25 despite deep rifts between pacifists and war supporters during World War I and the first Red Scare in 1918, during which several of its Communist members were harassed, watched and even arrested. Ms. Scutts writes that \"the linking of a wide range of pursuits in the name of liberty and the new -- suffrage, birth control, socialism, art, theater, psychology -- was what gave Heterodoxy and the Village their energy. One could talk about anything, anything! Now, that sparkling web was tightening into a net. One could be convicted for anything (anything!), too.\"</p><p>Ms. Scutts maintains that the feminists of Heterodoxy survived thanks to their close bonds with other women. \"Everything from the way they dressed to the company they kept and the causes they championed was self-consciously new and the daily pursuit of the future could be exhausting. They needed each other: as inspiration and support, as friends and lovers and rivals.\" At the core of the club, holding everything together, was deep and enduring friendship.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Hodgson is the author of \"It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time: My Adventures in Life and Food.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
