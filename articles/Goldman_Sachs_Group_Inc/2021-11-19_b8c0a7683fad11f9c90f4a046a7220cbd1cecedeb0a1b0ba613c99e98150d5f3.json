  "text": "<p>Japan's new prime minister has unveiled a ¥43.7tn ($383bn) stimulus package, including generous cash handouts for households and help for struggling businesses, to boost the country's lagging recovery from the pandemic.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52216cb9-0505-4fde-824a-58c7778d07e1\">massive spending</a> spree announced by Fumio Kishida on Friday defies a global trend <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6811d3f-6a29-4b4e-82c2-dd2b84184793\">to unwind</a> stimulus measures amid growing concerns of overheating. In contrast, Japan has struggled to lift consumption with its economy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cee35138-cc0c-41b1-9968-890d67fa9b23\">contracting</a> in the third quarter due to supply chain disruptions and coronavirus restrictions.</p> <p>The economic package — which includes ¥100,000 in stimulus cheques for households with children under 18, students and those on low incomes — was one of Kishida's main campaign pledges during last month's general election. </p> <p>Economists have questioned the effectiveness of cash distribution to boost consumption and the timing of the package. The Japanese economy is expected to recover in the next few months due to a sharp drop in Covid-19 cases and a lifting of restrictions on dining and domestic travel. </p> <p>Japan has already spent ¥88tn in fiscal stimulus, or nearly 17 per cent of gross domestic product, since the start of the Covid outbreak in 2020. The latest national government spending amounts to roughly 8 per cent of GDP.</p> <p>The entire package includes a further ¥12tn in local government spending and fiscal investment and loan programmes, and other borrowings, bringing the total to ¥78.9tn. The government estimates that the measures will lift Japan's economy by around 5.6 per cent.</p> <p>“We believe this economic package is sufficient both in terms of content and scale to deliver a sense of security and hope to the general public,” Kishida said on Friday.</p> <p>But critics have questioned whether the cheques will actually reach those hardest hit by the pandemic, and expect most of them to be transferred to bank savings. </p> <p>“We think the impact [on GDP] is likely to be far smaller than the government estimate,” said Naohiko Baba, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in Tokyo. He noted that 30 per cent of the Covid-related emergency funds have not actually been used and spending on public works, which has a greater impact on GDP, is limited in size in the latest package.</p> <p>In response to such scepticism, Daishiro Yamagiwa, economy minister, said: “The Kishida administration has a very strong desire to invest in younger people and children. As we implement these measures, we will ask for the public to sternly judge whether they were appropriate or not.”&#xa0;</p> <p>In addition to the stimulus cheques, the package also includes ¥2.5m in subsidies to smaller firms hit by Covid and tax breaks to encourage wage rises. It also covers money for a ¥10tn university endowment fund, subsidies to build chip plants and supply chains in Japan, and discounts for domestic travel. </p><p>Source: Kana Inagaki in Tokyo 2021 'Japan unveils $383bn stimulus package to boost lagging recovery' FT.com 19 November.
