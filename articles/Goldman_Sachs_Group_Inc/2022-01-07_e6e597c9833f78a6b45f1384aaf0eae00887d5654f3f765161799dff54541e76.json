  "title": "Is this finally the year for the FTSE 100? Here's what Goldman Sachs strategists say.",
  "text": "<p>Goldman strategists led by Sharon Bell say its large-cap exposure to financials and commodities, and lack of exposure to tech, is what has led to the FTSE underperformance.</p><p>They say there's several supports this year for the FTSE 100. Bond yields should rise, which should support value sectors over longer-duration growth ones. Commodity prices, especially for oil CL.1 and copper HG00, also may rise, supporting cash flows for those companies. A third support may come from high corporate cash balances, which should keep M&amp;A strong and boost buybacks and dividends.</p><p>In the medium term, however, the strategists fret that there's a lack of high-growth companies in the top U.K. index. There's also a lack of domestic support, as pension funds and insurers have been sellers, and households hold their wealth in deposits or housing.</p><p>“As such, the UK needs to attract overseas investment – two-thirds of the UK equity market is held by non-UK holders. The lack of domestic bid for stocks is probably also a factor in holding down valuations,” said the strategists.</p><p>The FTSE 100 did outperform rivals on Friday, trading steady as bond yields rose in reaction to the U.S. jobs report showing a decline in unemployment and a pickup in wages.</p>",
