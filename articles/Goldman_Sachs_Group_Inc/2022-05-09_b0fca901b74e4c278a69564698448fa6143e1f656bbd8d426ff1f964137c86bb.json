  "title": "Ford Sells About 8% of Its Stake in Electric-Vehicle Startup Rivian; Auto maker was early investor in Rivian but is now paring its stake as it expands its own EV lineup",
  "text": "<p>Ford sold about 8 million shares between late Sunday and Monday morning through Goldman Sachs, the people familiar with the move said. Ford is no longerpartnering to develop an EV with Rivian, as had been plannedunder its initial investment in 2019, and wants to gradually reduce its stake in what has become a rival in the electric-truck market, they said.</p><p>Before the sale, Ford held about 102 million shares in Rivian overall, about 11.4% of the company.</p><p>CNBC also reported that JPMorgan was planning to sell between 13 million and 15 million Rivian shares for an undisclosed stakeholder.</p><p>The lockup period for Rivian investors to sell stock after its initial public offering in November expired Sunday. Ford declined to comment. Rivian couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</p><p>Ford, an early investor in Rivian, has been aggressive in expanding its own lineup of electric vehicles, having recently started production of its own battery-powered pickup, the F-150 Lightning. The Lightning is a direct competitor to one of Rivian's first models, the all-electric R1T pickup, which went on sale late last year.</p><p>Rivian's debut on the public markets in November helped the company raise about $12 billion in new capital, at the time the most money raised in any U.S. listing since 2014. Its market capitalization briefly rose above that of Ford last fall, as investors bet the upstart would surpass incumbents in the auto industry's electric-vehicle race.</p><p>But Rivian's shares have tumbled this year, down 72% at Friday's close as the company has encountered challenges executing on its plans, including getting its factory fully ramped up. Like other EV makers, it has been under pressure to raise prices to counter fast-rising raw-materials costs for key battery inputs, such as lithium, cobalt and nickel.</p><p>On March 1, it told customers with reservations for vehicles that it would have to increase prices retroactively, only to later walk back the price increase after the move stoked a backlash. The company still plans to increase prices for future purchasers, but only on reservations placed after March 1.</p><p>While Rivian reported around 83,000 reservations at the end of March, it is having trouble getting its factory in Normal, Ill., operating at full speed. The former Mitsubishi Motors Corp. plant can produce 150,000 vehicles a year, but is currently producing around 1,000 of the vehicles a month.</p><p>Rivian has blamed its production woes on the global semiconductor shortage, which is hamstringing production at nearly every car maker in the world. In March, Rivian slashed its production plans for the year, saying it would aim to produce 25,000 vehicles this yearâ€”half of what it would have otherwise been able to build.</p><p>Rivian also has a deal to supply 100,000 battery-powered delivery vans to Amazon.com Inc., another investor in the young car manufacturer.</p><p>Sean McLain contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Mike Colias at Mike.Colias@wsj.com</p><p>Ford Sells About 8% of Its Stake in Electric-Vehicle Startup Rivian</p>",
