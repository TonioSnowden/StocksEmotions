  "text": "<p>   Reddit, the company that was the staging ground for the revolt of amateur traders, also did well. It went from a private valuation of $3 billion in 2019 to $10 billion last summer after WallStreetBets helped to raise its profile. It has filed for an initial public offering. </p><p>   Reddit co-founder and CEO Steve Huffman told the Journal that he would like to see retail investors, normally shut out of juicy deals, participate in the IPO. </p><p>   Wall Street is still expected to be involved. The offering is being lead-managed by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Adapted from \"The Revolution That Wasn't: GameStop, Reddit, and the Fleecing of Small Investors\" by The Wall Street Journal's Spencer Jakab, to be published on Feb. 1 by Portfolio. </p><p></p>",
