  "text": "<p>\"He saw an opportunity to use his position at Goldman to get rich by cheating,\" the prosecutor said.</p><p>Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Mr. Ng, said his client was innocent and pinned the blame on Mr. Ng's boss, former Goldman partner Timothy Leissner, who is the government's star witness and previously pleaded guilty to U.S. charges of conspiracy to launder money and violate antibribery laws for his role in the scandal.</p><p>\"This is a massive crime and there are lots of guilty people. He's just not one of them,\" Mr. Agnifilo said of Mr. Ng.</p><p>Mr. Ng is the first criminal defendant in the U.S. case to face a jury.</p><p>Mr. Ng and Mr. Low were charged in 2018 with conspiring to launder money that was misappropriated from 1MDB and with two counts of conspiring to violate the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.</p><p>Mr. Low's whereabouts are unknown. However, in 2019 he agreed to forfeit more than $700 million in assets U.S. authorities had sought to seize.</p><p>Lawyers for Messrs. Leissner and Low didn't respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment.</p><p>Between 2009 and 2014, the laundered money was used to pay bribes to high-level government officials to obtain business for Goldman, federal prosecutors say. During that time, the bank helped raise about $6.5 billion for 1MDB through three bond offerings and earned $600 million in fees and revenue.</p><p>The scandal chastened the bank. It paid more than $5 billion in penalties to the U.S. and Malaysia. Its board called the matter an \"institutional failure.\"</p><p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who was accused of embezzling more than $680 million from the 1MDB fund, was sentenced in 2020 to 12 years imprisonment after a court in his country found him guilty of abuse of power.</p><p>Mr. Low is accused of masterminding the plundering of the fund and acting as an intermediary between Goldman employees and government officials. He and others used the stolen money to buy real estate and artwork and bankroll Hollywood films, according to federal prosecutors.</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Ng, a Malaysian national, have said that he warned members of Goldman's legal, compliance and investment divisions about Mr. Low, but the bank continued to deal with him.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
