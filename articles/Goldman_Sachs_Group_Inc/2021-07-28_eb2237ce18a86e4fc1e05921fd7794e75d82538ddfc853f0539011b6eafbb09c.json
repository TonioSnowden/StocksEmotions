  "title": "U.S. News:  Companies Urge, but Few Require, Getting Covid Shot  ----  By Ray A. Smith",
  "text": "<p>   Companies are encouraging their workers to get vaccinated as Covid-19 cases climb again. Yet relatively few workplaces are making shots required. </p><p>   On Monday, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs became the first federal agency to require employee vaccinations, and California became the first state to do so for its public workers. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that all municipal employees will be required to be vaccinated by Sept. 13, or get tested weekly, and urged the city's private employers to push similar measures. </p><p>   President Biden said Tuesday that a vaccine mandate for all federal employees was under consideration. </p><p>   Some companies, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co., have mandated that all workers must get vaccinated or divulge their vaccination status before returning to the office. United Airlines requires Covid-19 vaccines for new employees. </p><p>   Overall, though, Covid-19 vaccine mandates at work remain rare, partly because doing so can be a legal minefield for companies, employment attorneys say. In some cases, mandates have resulted in employee lawsuits and termination of workers. And in a tight labor market, employers also risk losing workers who balk at such requirements. </p><p>   What appears to be emerging for many workers is a patchwork approach to vaccine mandates based on job type, geography, work setting and clientele. Some meat-processing companies required the vaccine for new corporate hires this spring, but stopped short of mandating vaccines for the whole workforce. </p><p>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Tuesday that vaccinated people resume wearing masks in some indoor spaces, reversing its guidance from May that most vaccinated people no longer needed to mask or physically distance in most indoor and outdoor settings. </p><p>   In hospitals and healthcare settings, where more mandates have been rolled out than in other sectors, fully vaccinating staff is about protecting clients who are immunocompromised in addition to employees, executives say. </p><p>   Heather Berg, a group leader at a nonprofit that runs after-school programs in California, says she wants more employers to require vaccines, especially those operating in healthcare or with children. \"I feel like if you're not interested in protecting people's health, why do you work in healthcare?\" she says.\" </p><p>   Ms. Berg says her employer, who she joined last month, doesn't mandate vaccination, which made her hesitant to take the job at first. But she says she felt reassured when the people who hired her volunteered that they had been vaccinated. For now, she and other staff members and the children wear masks indoors. </p><p>   \"I hate it, I wear glasses and they fog up,\" she says. \"I wish everyone would get vaccinated so we can be done with it.\" </p><p>   A recent survey by the American Medical Association found 96% of physicians have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, but among healthcare workers overall, a recent analysis of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data found one in four hospital workers with direct contact with patients hadn't received a dose by the end of May. </p><p>   As companies plan to reopen offices to workers in larger numbers come September, some are telling employees to get vaccinated before they return. To do so, some are offering perks, human-resources experts say. </p><p>   General Electric Co. hasn't required employees to get vaccinated, noting that such a move would be complicated for its global operations. The company started to educate and encourage workers early in the year to get vaccinated. \"At this point, we have no plans to make vaccinations mandatory,\" Chief Executive Larry Culp said Tuesday. </p><p>   A Willis Towers Watson survey in May of 660 U.S. employers showed 72% said they wouldn't require employees to get a vaccine. Since then, some employers have said they are rethinking mandates as the highly contagious Delta variant spreads, says Jeff Levin-Scherz, the firm's leader on population health. </p><p></p>",
