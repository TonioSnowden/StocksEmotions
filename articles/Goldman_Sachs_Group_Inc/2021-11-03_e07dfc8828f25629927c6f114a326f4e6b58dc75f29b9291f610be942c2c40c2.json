  "text": "<p>Goldman named just 465 new managing directors two years ago, part of a bid to cut costs and renew the luster of its highest ranks.</p><p>The bank said the much-bigger 2021 class reflects the firm's rising head count and investments in its asset-management and consumer arms. Goldman has about 43,000 employees, up from 37,800 two years ago.</p><p>New managing directors are granted access to the bank's leadership-training program, private investment funds and a personal wealth adviser.</p><p>About 11% of the newly minted directors are based in areas the firm has identified as strategic locations, including Salt Lake City, Dallas and Bengaluru, India.</p><p>Goldman said the class is the most diverse in its history. It includes 30% women, up slightly from 29% in 2019. Close to 5% of the promoted directors are Black, up from 4% in 2019.</p><p>Goldman last month reported a big jump in third-quarter earnings, fueled by deal making.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
