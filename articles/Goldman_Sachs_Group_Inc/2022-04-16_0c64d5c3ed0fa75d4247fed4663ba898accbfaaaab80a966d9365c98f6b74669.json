  "title": "World News: Car Makers Set to Restart Chinese Plants",
  "text": "<p>Some economists expect China's economic growth this year to fall well short of the official target of about 5.5% -- a rate of expansion seen by senior officials as needed to create more than 11 million urban jobs. China is set to release its first-quarter economic results Monday.</p><p>Tesla, which halted manufacturing at its Shanghai factory on March 28, is preparing to restart some production there Monday, people familiar with the matter said. The U.S. electric-car maker plans to start with one shift and increase to two shifts by the end of April, as it expects that more workers would be released from lockdowns, one of the people said. The plan could still change if cases surge again and the city tightens controls, the people said.</p><p>Shanghai-based SAIC, China's largest state-owned auto maker and one of the city's biggest employers, also is preparing to resume production in stages at its plants starting next week, according to a Shanghai official briefed on the matter and an internal company notice viewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>While SAIC has kept some of its plants operating under a closed-loop system during the Shanghai lockdown, others have halted production. That includes the plant it jointly operates with Volkswagen AG, the German car maker said.</p><p>Employees returning to work at Tesla and SAIC's plants must get Covid tests every 48 hours, according to the people and the SAIC notice.</p><p>Tesla, SAIC and Volkswagen didn't respond to requests to comment sent in after Friday working hours in China.</p><p>On Friday, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology vowed to help key companies in Shanghai resume work by clearing logistical obstacles and ensuring supplies of key raw materials. It has made a priority list of 666 companies in key industries such as automotive, semiconductor and biomedicine to make sure they can restart, it said on its website.</p><p>Car manufacturing, one of the biggest contributors to China's gross domestic product, is among the industries hardest hit by China's Covid-19 controls and lockdowns in cities like Shanghai, as well as Changchun, another automotive hub that was closed for nearly a month until last week.</p><p>Car sales dropped 10.5% in March from a year earlier, and industry executives and analysts expect April numbers will show further declines. Shanghai accounts for 11% of China's automotive production, and some suppliers there also export components.</p><p>Auto and technology executives in recent days have warned that extended production halts in the Shanghai area could lead to big economic losses.</p><p>\"If production couldn't be resumed in Shanghai, all technology and industrial sectors with supply-chain links to Shanghai -- especially the auto industry -- will be completely shut down after May, causing a huge economic price,\" Richard Yu, the head of Huawei Technologies Co.'s automotive solution sector, said Friday in a post on social-media platform WeChat.</p><p>That followed concerns shared by the chief executive of electric car maker XPeng Inc. on Thursday. He Xiaopeng said all auto makers in China could be forced to suspend production in May if suppliers in Shanghai and surrounding areas can't resume operations. In a WeChat post, Mr. He also said that he expects more support from the government as authorities are trying to coordinate on the matter.</p><p>In a poll of 102 companies across 31 cities in China, analysts at Goldman Sachs found that 94% of the auto-sector companies surveyed are facing challenges in production and material sourcing, because of their just-in-time production models. Meanwhile, impact on semiconductor, hardware and industrial tech sectors was minimal, they said.</p><p>Logistics is a common bottleneck for manufacturers in eastern China, the Goldman Sachs analysts said. Many companies and truck drivers have blamed strict pandemic-control measures and some inconsistency in policies from different authorities for the supply-chain jam.</p><p>Big shipyards in Shanghai such as Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding (Group) Co., Jiangnan Shipyard (Group) Co. and Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding Co. have effectively halted operations since mid-March, and have over the past 10 days declared force majeure on pending ship deliveries, due to the city's lockdowns, shipbuilding executives said.</p>",
