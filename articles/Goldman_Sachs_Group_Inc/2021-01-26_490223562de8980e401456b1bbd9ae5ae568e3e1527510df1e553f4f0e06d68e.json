  "text": "<p>Talks for a deal between the ownership group behind Liverpool FC and the Boston Red Sox and a blank-cheque company led by <em>Moneyball</em> executive Billy Beane have fallen apart, according to people briefed on the matter.</p> <p>Instead, they said Fenway Sports Group, the ownership vehicle for both clubs controlled by billionaire John Henry, was in discussions to sell a minority stake to RedBird Capital, a private investment firm founded by former Goldman Sachs veteran Gerry Cardinale.</p> <p>The private transaction would probably result in a lower valuation for Fenway<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bcd99e94-1543-4d94-ad6c-0e0fb655756c\"> than the $8bn</a> floated for a potential acquisition by RedBall, a special purpose acquisition company directed by Mr Cardinale and Mr Beane, the people familiar with the discussions said.</p> <p>The talks between Mr Cardinale and Mr Henry were described as continuing, and there was no guarantee they would reach a deal.&#xa0; </p> <p>A transaction between the two companies would continue a recent trend involving <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ba35ff2-ac31-41d2-8ff9-6107a64d0ae5\">private capital investment in major sport clubs and leagues</a> around the world, particularly as the industry has been hampered by the pandemic. Private equity firms have been seeking deals from Italy's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85191ee1-7b0c-4329-bc7a-b1c3338241e9\">Serie A</a> to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59682c75-1537-40b2-9050-deb606300026\">Germany's Bundesliga</a> and with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24e9fc43-4187-4884-8efe-7a6efb496f24\">New Zealand's All Blacks</a> rugby team.</p> <p>A private deal between RedBird and Fenway would mean Mr Beane and Mr Cardinale would seek a different target for their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03af250b-6acf-4b23-9608-a90b291f75f3\">RedBall Spac, launched in July</a> with the purpose of raising $575m to acquire a sports franchise.&#xa0;</p> <p>Discussions about the potential for the private investment in Fenway <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/red-sox-public-spac-no-deal-72eb6b14-0844-4156-b03f-3456217083e4.html\">were earlier reported by Axios</a>.</p> <p>Mr Beane is best known for his analytics expertise working in the front office of Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics, where he became the subject of the Michael Lewis best-selling book, <em>Moneyball, </em>which was later made into a film starring Brad Pitt.</p> <p>Mr Cardinale is best known for launching the regional broadcast network of the New York Yankees, YES, and currently manages more than $4bn in assets at RedBird, which recently acquired French football club Toulouse.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mr Henry, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e60b408e-f325-4340-a342-6d5f0b11762b\">a commodities trading veteran</a> who made billions crunching numbers, translated that success into owning two sports teams and stewarding them to championship seasons. Friends, baseball industry experts and former colleagues describe him as a champion of analytics in sports — like Mr Beane.</p><p>Source: Sara Germano and James Fontanella-Khan in New York 2021 'Talks end on blank-cheque deal for Liverpool FC' FT.com 26 January.
