  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq are on track to lose 1.7% and 3%, respectively, this week.</p><p>Though Friday's moves continue a turbulent stretch for major indexes, the moves have been tepid compared with the mammoth moves around the globe. Friday's moves cap a haywire week, with giant swings across currencies, commodities and stocks around the world. Many traders scrambled to understand the impact of the sanctions and subsequent changes made by exchanges and financial firms around the globe after Russia's economy was severed from the rest of the world.</p><p>The New York Stock Exchange halted trading in three Russia-linked exchange-traded funds, following a similar move with NYSE-listed Russian stocks earlier this week. Index providers moved to drop Russian stocks from influential indexes this week. Russia's central bank kept theMoscow stock market largely closed for a fifth straight day, shielding local shares from a potential selloff.</p><p>Earlier in the week, clearinghouse operator Euroclear stopped investors from clearing trades involving ruble-denominated securities, while its competitor, Clearstream, said it would stop settling trades for various Russian-linked stocks and bonds, leaving some traders in the dark about their positions.</p><p>The Russian ruble declined again, with the currency down 2.2% against the greenback in recent trading, trading at 112.53 per U.S. dollar. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of 16 others, was up 0.5% to trade near its highest level since July 2020. Meanwhile, the euro continued its recent fall.</p><p>A sharp run-up in commodity prices has raised concerns about economic growth globally. The invasion and rising prices could further stoke inflation at a time when prices have already been at a 40-year high.</p><p>West Texas Intermediate crude briefly topped $116 for the first time since 2008 this week. Corn futures were on track for their biggest weekly gain since 2008 as of early trading Friday. Wheat prices also soared.</p><p>Some investors have said they are growing more concerned about stagflation, a combination of muted economic growth and high inflation.</p><p>\"It's beginning to look a little stagflationary,\" said Anwiti Bahuguna, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle. \"We have inflation sticking around longer and growth taking a leg down.\"</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group analysts said Thursday that higher oil and gas prices are the \"key inflation risk for the United States\" and that higher commodity prices threaten economic growth. Each 10% increase in crude oil prices can lower GDP growth, they said, as consumers pull back on spending because of higher gas prices.</p><p>Investors remained focused on the sharp rise in oil prices for much of the week. On Friday, front-month futures prices for Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, rose 3% to $113.81 a barrel.</p><p>\"It feels like it's going to get a little higher from here, and it's just a question of how much higher,\" said Tom Reilly, an energy derivatives broker at TP ICAP Group, adding that there have been some sleepless nights for traders over the past week. \"People are kind of waking up every couple hours and checking things to make sure things have not gotten too far out of whack.\"</p><p>Rising oil prices and the prospect of slower economic growth have also pushed investors into traditionally safer investments such as government bonds.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined to 1.712% in trading Friday, on track for the biggest one-week yield decline since March 2020. Bond yields fall as prices rise. Bond yields have swung wildly throughout the week as investors have monitored the Russian invasion, comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and economic data.</p><p>Bitcoin prices slipped to around $40,178 in recent trading.</p><p>A strong jobs number early Friday wasn't enough to push major indexes higher and stall the decline in bond yields.</p><p>New data on Friday showed that the U.S. added 678,000 jobs in February, more than the 440,000 expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. The Federal Reserve has signaled that it is on track for a quarter-percentage-point interest-rate increase at its March meeting, removing some near-term uncertainty about interest rates.</p><p>\"The jobs report was strong,\" said Amy Kong, chief investment officer at Barrett Asset Management. But \"it doesn't necessarily change the Fed stance,\" she said.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index dropped 7% this week, its biggest weekly decline since March 2020. It closed at its lowest level in around a year, reflecting concerns that Europe will bear the brunt of the economic fallout from the Russia-Ukraine crisis.</p><p>Despite the volatility, stocks in New York have been relatively resilient amid the conflict.</p><p>\"The U.S. is less vulnerable to the Russia-Ukraine crisis than what you would see in Europe,\" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. For now, she said, \"The market is looking at [the situation] and saying the U.S. economy is strong.\"</p><p>European bank stocks tumbled. Société Générale lost around 10.6% after the French lender said Thursday that its exposure to Russia stood at 18.6 billion euros, equivalent to over $20 billion, at the end of 2021.</p><p>Russian shelling in southern Ukraine, which caused a fire at a nuclear power plant, intensified fears among investors Friday about Moscow's tactics and concerns about a nuclear disaster. However, officials said the fire didn't affect essential equipment, lessening worries about reactor damage.</p><p>Shares of Smith &amp; Wesson Brands dropped almost 15% after the gun maker reported that sales fell more than 30% during the holiday quarter.</p><p>Asian stocks dropped, in part reflecting Thursday's actionon Wall Street, where technology stocks sold off more than the broader market and U.S.-listed Chinese companies stumbled.</p><p>Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 2.2% lower Friday. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 2.5%, registering its lowest close since March 2020.</p><p>—Joe Wallace and Alexander Osipovich contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com and Clarence Leong at clarence.leong@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Falls More Than 300 Points As Concerns Mount Over Russia, Ukraine</p>",
