  "title": "Investors Rekindle Love Affair With Short-Term Success; Companies are starting to understand the implications of the Fed's moves: If they want a healthy share price, focus on profits today—not moonshot projects",
  "text": "<p>Investors lost their zeal for speculative super-long-term bets last year, and the stocks of lossmaking early-stage growth companies in fields such as online taxis, electric cars, instant groceries, space tourism and even internet dog walking crashed.</p><p>This year, the malaise spread to the biggest growth stocks. Last week, shares in Meta Platforms, nee Facebook, plummeted 25% in a day after founder Mark Zuckerberg insisted he would press on with a moonshot-scale bet on developing virtual reality. Investors don't want to finance long-term projects with returns that even Mr. Zuckerberg admits he has no way to forecast.</p><p>In the new environment, investors would much rather see cold hard cash than throw money at leaps into the unknown. Companies are starting to understand the implications: If they want a healthy share price, focus on profits today. That matters both for investors and for the economy.</p><p>When rates were at zero and the Fed was buying government bonds, investors felt they had to take more risk to earn a return. Companies could borrow for less than ever before and as memories of the 2008-09 global financial crisis faded, shareholders encouraged those with what were perceived as good ideas to spend big to try to make \"moonshot\" plans come good.</p><p>Such bets are mostly history, because the Fed and other central banks have been frantically hiking rates to tackle runaway inflation. In just the past year, the real cost of 10-year borrowing has jumped from 1 percentage point below inflation to 1.5 points above. That's a gigantic shift, by far the biggest since 2003, when the Treasury's figures for Treasury inflation-protected securities start.</p><p>ARK Innovation, perhaps the fund with the most exposure to companies chasing high-risk, high-reward, long-term ideas, has lost more than three-quarters of its value since its peak in February last year.</p><p>Outside the world of wild bets on the far-distant future, capital projects with more predictable payoffs are still being funded—but CEOs say that may not last.</p><p>Ryan Hammond, a U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, says this year the biggest cut in spending has been on buybacks as companies hoard cash, with capital expenditure, or capex, and research and development continuing to grow. Next year may be a different story, though, and he forecasts a sharp drop in the growth rate of capex.</p><p>\"When growth slows, usually investors reward those companies returning cash to shareholders,\" he said. \"There's some skepticism about investing at a time when the economy is slowing, will the RoI [return on investment] reward the higher cost of capital?\"</p><p>The proportion of business leaders planning to increase capital spending is the lowest since 2013, aside from the pandemic, according to the New York Federal Reserve. The share planning to cut capex has doubled since February to 18%, although remains far below that reached in past recessions.</p><p>Salman Ahmed, global head of macro at Fidelity International, says still-strong capex reflects past easy money. \"It's an indicator of last year's frenzy and will go away,\" he said. \"This year's leading indicators—IPOs and M&amp;A have collapsed—I would think will show up in next year's capex numbers.\"</p><p>Other forms of capex may be viewed more positively, and certainly companies are still spending, for now. The Philadelphia Fed survey of manufacturers last month found more firms planned to increase than reduce spending on energy-saving projects and non-computer equipment, even as more prepared to reduce than increase capex on buildings, computers and software. Government efforts to boost microchip production, protectionism on electric-car subsidies and corporate worries about supply chains should support domestic capex.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What are the implications of a return to short-term thinking on Wall Street? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The embrace of short termism plays into the arguments of those who say too much short-term thinking has been a scourge on the economy. The reality, as I've written before, is that the markets have been happy to finance exceptionally long-term projects for a decade, throwing money at companies to launch lossmaking land grabs.</p><p>That's changing and the risk is that companies find it harder to justify worthwhile and profitable projects—good for the economy—even as renewed investment discipline puts an end to many wasteful white elephants.</p><p>There are other factors at play besides the Fed. What's likely to develop is a broader version of what happened to oil companies after their shares were crushed in 2016. After years of shareholders encouraging them to drill and expand, plunging crude prices switched the focus of investors to return on capital, and the engineers who led the industry lost their dominance to accountants.</p><p>The interaction between fundamental forces and shareholder desires are still discouraging capex by major oil companies. Crude prices may be near $90 still and profits and share prices sky-high, but oil demand is expected to weaken in coming years and valuations are low.</p><p>\"The goal here is to sustain and grow the enterprise with the lowest capital possible,\" Pierre Breber, chief financial officer of Chevron, told analysts last week. \"And we are not really paid for growth by the market.\"</p><p>Wall Street has gone through the same switch it did with oil, suddenly applying a much higher cost of capital via lower share prices and higher borrowing costs. Moonshots are out, advertising and brand-building plans are being scaled back and capex for expansion will be next in line. The best hope for capex is for short-term projects where investors and finance departments can see the immediate payoffs in greater efficiencies.</p><p>Expect stocks that give priority to stronger balance sheets and return spare cash to shareholders to beat those that keep plowing money back into growth. Only the firms with the strongest records of innovation, huge cash piles or ability to ignore investor pressure are likely to keep making wildly ambitious high-risk, high-reward bets.</p><p>Write to James Mackintosh at james.mackintosh@wsj.com</p><p>Investors Rekindle Love Affair With Short-Term Success</p>",
