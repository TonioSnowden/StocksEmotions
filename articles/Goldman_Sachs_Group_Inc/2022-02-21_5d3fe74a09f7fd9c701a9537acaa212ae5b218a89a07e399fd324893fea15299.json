  "text": "<h1>Are green-themed funds all they're cracked up to be?</h1> <p>Environmental, social and governance investing has been a source of huge growth for the asset management industry in recent years. It could soon become a source of big problems.</p> <p>Industry insiders are starting to worry that some of the overly optimistic or misleading ESG claims that have been made in fund documents and marketing could trigger a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2abb8482-c9b3-11e9-a1f4-3669401ba76f\">mis-selling scandal</a> similar to those in PPI, endowment mortgages or diesel cars.</p> <p>“It's a bit like history repeating itself,” says <strong>Fiona Huntriss</strong>, a partner at law firm <strong>Pallas Partners</strong>, who focuses on financial litigation and has worked on previous mis-selling cases. “Words are being used in a very vague way” by fund companies, she adds. “Inconsistency, omissions, lack of clarity — that's prime territory for mis-selling claims.”</p> <p>Allegations of “greenwashing” in the funds industry have long been rife, but two recent high-profile cases have raised the stakes. </p> <p>German asset manager <strong>DWS </strong>is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3d6a8d1-0800-41c9-ab92-c0d9fce1f6e1\">facing an investigation</a> over whether it misled clients about its sustainable investing efforts. And <strong>Tariq Fancy</strong>, former global chief investment officer for sustainable investing at <strong>BlackRock</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec02fd5d-e8bd-45bd-b015-a5799ae820cf\">blew the whistle</a> on the climate claims of ESG funds. </p> <p>Sustainable investing too often boils down to little more than “marketing hype” and “disingenuous promises”, he said last year. “I do think there will be more scandals to appear and it's going to come to light soon,” he told the Financial Times.</p> <p>All of this has ramped up the fear factor for many executives, who are starting to worry about the precise marketing wording they have been using. </p> <p>Some lawyers, meanwhile, are arguing that the typically woolly language of ESG — “sustainable”, “green” and so forth — may actually mean something in law after all. The 2015 Paris Agreement must surely provide the ultimate legal definition of “sustainable”, some say. So if you use that word to market your fund, but its portfolio companies are not Paris-aligned, could it have been mis-sold? And will a disclaimer in the fine print be adequate if the fund has been sold to retail investors?</p> <p>The potential implications are huge, report my colleagues <em>Laurence Fletcher</em> and <em>Joshua Oliver</em> in this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae78c05a-0481-4774-8f9b-d3f02e4f2c6f\">must-read investigation</a>. Research group <strong>InfluenceMap</strong>, for instance, found that 421 out of 593 ESG equity funds had portfolios that were not Paris-aligned. Climate-themed funds were found to hold positions in large oil and gas stocks.</p> <p>It appears that regulators are finally waking up to the dangers. Having been slow to react to the sector's rapid growth, a raft of rules and guidelines are starting to tighten up many of the definitions and wording. </p> <p>The <strong>European Securities and Markets Authority</strong> is seeking a definition of greenwashing that can be used by lawmakers, the <strong>Advertising Standards Agency</strong> is stepping up scrutiny of ESG adverts, and the <strong>Financial Conduct Authority</strong> and the <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission </strong>are also sharpening their focus.</p> <p>All of this suggests that we are just at the beginning of the road on this one.</p> <h1>Taming the buyout barbarians</h1> <p>After watching their pay soar last year, it is difficult to imagine that investment bankers on Wall Street might ever feel envy. But it's a cruel old world out there, and the rewards for employees of the private equity industry are rising faster. Much faster. </p> <p>About $2mn in total pay and benefits per employee was earmarked in 2021 by the five largest listed private equity managers — <strong>Blackstone</strong>, <strong>KKR</strong>, <strong>Carlyle</strong>, <strong>Apollo</strong> and <strong>Ares</strong>.</p> <p>That $2mn figure, revealed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df74c731-4d50-4420-8380-c83205c4c055\">in a story</a> by my colleague <em>Antoine Gara</em>, was more than double the payout at <strong>Evercore Partners</strong>, the investment banking advisory firm with the highest remuneration per head, and five times what the average employee at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> took home. </p> <p>Skyrocketing rewards for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c56a7da-6435-469c-90d8-28e966f20379\">buyout barbarians</a> underscores how the balance of money and power has shifted towards the less regulated corner of Wall Street. </p> <p>But could the pendulum be about to swing the other way?</p> <p>US regulators have just revealed plans to impose sweeping reforms on the secretive private equity industry with the clear intention of strengthening the position of investors. </p> <p>The SEC's <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-19\">plans to transform</a> and standardise private equity reporting and disclosure standards represent arguably the most far-reaching programme of reforms since the business model for modern private equity partnerships emerged in the 1960s.</p> <p>Critics say reforms are long overdue. Their argument has been strengthened by the SEC's highly detailed criticisms of hidden fees charged by private equity managers and misleading performance claims.</p> <p>Investors have overwhelmingly welcomed the reform push, as <em>Chris Flood</em> and Antoine outline in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec661f96-4c71-4361-a823-00bb69ba0fc0\">this analysis</a>. “These are a very investor-friendly set of proposals,” says <strong>Igor Rozenblit</strong>, founder of the <strong>Iron Road Partners</strong> consultancy and a former senior SEC regulator. “They will provide more leverage to investors.”</p> <p>Private equity managers have so far remained largely silent about the SEC's plans. But expect stiff resistance to any changes from the industry's hugely powerful lobby in Washington.</p> <p>It will have to reckon with <strong>Gary Gensler</strong>, the head of the SEC. He <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f49d0483-be91-417d-9688-aea700743f03\">appears determined</a> to push for the completion of the new rules before the US midterm elections in November when the political balance in Congress might change.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Gensler's predecessor as SEC chair, <strong>Jay Clayton</strong>, now works as chair of Apollo, the latest example of the poacher turned gamekeeper conveyor belt in the US that propels former top public officials into lucrative roles in the finance industry.</p> <p>So maybe the best hope for private equity managers intent on diluting the proposed reforms might just be to quietly dangle the prospect of a similar post-SEC role to Gensler.</p> <p>Oh, and while we're on the subject of barbarians, don't miss this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVMo49zKwUI\">new HBO documentary</a> on <strong>Carl Icahn, </strong>a man who owns a cushion embroidered with the statement “Happiness is positive cash flow”.

The metal, used by investors as a store of value in times of stress, has climbed more than 5 per cent this month and broke above $1,900 a troy ounce on Friday before easing back to $1,888.</p> <p>The crisis in Ukraine has provided the impetus for the advance, although analysts reckon gold is also benefiting from concerns that US growth could slow as the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> is forced to act aggressively to get inflation under control.</p> <p>“The potential for a [inflation-induced] monetary policy error and elevated recession risks are providing support,” says <strong>Citigroup</strong> analyst <strong>Aakash Doshi</strong>, who thinks the yellow metal could hit $1,950 over the next three months.</p> <h1>10 unmissable stories this week</h1> <p><strong>Cathie Wood</strong>'s breathless promotion of gene editing should worry us all, argues <em>David Crow</em> in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4abf0f81-7e5a-4e93-8ccc-dbd23d5c88f3\">this column</a>.
