  "text": "<p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do the predictions of earnings reveal to you about the state of the economy? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is down 28% so far this year, slightly underperforming the S&amp;P 500. \"Investors want to own bank stocks, but heading into the rest of the year, there is a lot of caution behind that,\" said KBW analyst David Konrad. One key question for investors will be whether that future economic pain is already reflected in current stock prices.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is slated to report results on Friday, along with Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Morgan Stanley. Bank of America Corp. will report on Monday, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. follows the next day. Here are some things to watch.</p><p>Interest Rates</p><p>The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates several times this year and signaled that further increases are on the way. That means higher profit margins for banks on loans: Analysts polled by FactSet expect significantly higher net interest margins in the third quarter than they did at the beginning of the year.</p><p>U.S. banks extended some $2.76 trillion in loans to U.S. businesses in the third quarter through Sept. 28, according to data from the Federal Reserve, up 14% from a year earlier and up 3% from the end of the second quarter.</p><p>Higher rates also come with major drawbacks. Banks hold securities that experience unrealized losses when rates increase. Those losses will require banks to hold additional capital to satisfy rules set by regulators.</p><p>That limits their ability to lend money to consumers and businesses and return capital to shareholders. Analysts at KBW project stock repurchases will be on hold until next year for Citigroup, JPMorgan and Bank of America.</p><p>Consumers</p><p>The labor market has cooled somewhat, but the economy still added a seasonally adjusted 263,000 jobs in September. The unemployment rate reached 3.5%, matching a 50-year low. Inflation has leveled off but remains sharply higher than it was a year ago.</p><p>Bank of America's customers increased debit- and credit card spending by 9% in September from a year earlier, the bank said Tuesday. They \"are in very good shape,\" Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said at an investor conference last month.</p><p>Other data paint a murkier picture. Spending on Chase credit and debit cards rose 25% in September from the same month in 2019, according to analysts at JPMorgan. But spending on hotels, which surged after the pandemic, has weakened.</p><p>Meanwhile, the highest mortgage rates since 2007 have taken a toll on the housing market. Existing-home sales have declined for seven months in a row through August. Home prices are still rising on a year-over-year basis, but the pace of growth has slowed. Banks' home-lending businesses are likely to feel the effects of the slowdown.</p><p>Banks could set aside more money to cover expected loan losses in the future, which would hit profits and signal growing recession fears. Analysts polled by FactSet expect JPMorgan and Bank of America to take roughly $1.5 billion and $760 million charges on credit, respectively, including provision for future losses.</p><p>Wall Street</p><p>Investment bankers are struggling this year. Deal making has stalled, as has the market for initial public offerings.</p><p>Fiscal third-quarter results from Jefferies Financial Group show what might be in store for Wall Street giants Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Jefferies reported $682 million in investment-banking revenue in the three months ended Aug. 31, down 42% from a year earlier.</p><p>Wild movements in stocks, bonds and foreign-exchange rates are hurting the business of investment banking, but trading remains a bright spot. Volatile markets kept bank trading desks busy connecting buyers and sellers in the second quarter. That trend should continue, though investors will be on guard for any losses from trades gone awry.</p><p>One big area of weakness: leveraged lending.</p><p>Banks have struggled to find willing buyers for billions of dollars worth of debt they committed to fund private-equity buyouts.</p><p>Banks including Goldman Sachs and Bank of America auctioned off loans and bonds for Citrix Systems at a discount, resulting in $500 million worth of losses. That could harm their third-quarter results and further chill an already weak environment for buyouts. Elon Musk's possible acquisition of Twitter might leave banks on the hook for further losses later this year.</p><p>Write to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com</p><p>Rising Rates, Uncertain Economy Expected to Take a Toll on Bank Profits</p>",
