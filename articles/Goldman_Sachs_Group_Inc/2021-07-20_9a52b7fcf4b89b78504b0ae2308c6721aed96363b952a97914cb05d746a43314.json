  "text": "<p>Will the most disruptive companies in the world decide to trust a group of the biggest incumbents? On Tuesday, Nasdaq said it would separate its existing marketplace for private company shares <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25a35831-d106-49ac-8d3b-6fc6cb99284a\">into a new unit</a>. That new division would join forces with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Silicon Valley lender SVB. </p> <p>As tech start-ups have delayed going public, employees have relied on an increasing number of private share exchanges to turn their stock options into cash. These private market upstarts have helped private share deals become more mainstream. But this new juggernaut featuring the biggest players in financial services will prove exceptionally difficult to compete against.</p> <p>Public market exchanges such as Nasdaq and NYSE have become increasingly efficient through technology. Now the sector has consolidated with just a few players owning most bourses. The efficiency of trading has forced players into ancillary products like selling data feeds in order to kickstart growth. Private market trading is relatively modest with something like $30bn of shares trading annually by some estimates. These trades tend to be cumbersome and expensive — one upstart exchange charges seller and buyers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b84a688-f745-4727-bed6-74baad3c9807\">1 per cent</a>. The bid-ask spreads is often wide enough to trigger discount transactions.&#xa0;</p> <p>Still, research firm CB Insights says there are more than 700 unicorns at the moment. The Nasdaq private market can take advantage of the global relationships of its new Wall Street partners to create deeper, more liquid and more efficient markets. The likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley benefit from the suite of services they provide to listed companies. Now as a part of the Nasdaq offering, they can get in front of private companies that are candidates for IPOs. There is even a chance that some companies could eschew the public markets forever.</p> <p>Given the resources and sophistication that the Nasdaq private market can offer, one wonders what is left for the nascent private exchanges such as Carta and EquityZen. Economies of scale and breadth of services matter in financial services. The resulting compression in fees is hard to argue with even if it favours Wall Street incumbents. One could see emerging companies feeling uncomfortable about relying on Goliaths. But such finer feelings will generally fade in the light of a tighter bid-ask spread.</p> <p><em>Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers is published twice weekly.
