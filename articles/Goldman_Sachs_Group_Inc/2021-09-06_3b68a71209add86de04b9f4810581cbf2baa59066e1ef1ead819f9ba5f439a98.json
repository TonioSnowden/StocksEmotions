  "title": "Labor Day Return to Normal in New York Is Tripped Up by Delta Variant; Summer increase in Covid-19 cases prompts many employers in city to delay the resumption of office work",
  "text": "<p>Actual office occupancy in New York lags behind that of Philadelphia and Chicago, according to August data from Kastle Systems, which analyzes swipe-card entries.</p><p>Return-to-Office Prep</p><p>Join Wall Street Journal technology columnist Christopher Mims, Work &amp; Life columnist Rachel Feintzeig and reporter Chip Cutter for a conversation about what to expect as we look toward office returns.</p><p>* Our Live Q&amp;A starts at 2 p.m. EDT, Wednesday, Sept. 8</p><p>New York City needs Manhattan's 1.2 million office workers back to reinvigorate the economy, and officials have said they are trying to lead by example. Mayor Bill de Blasio brought public workers back by requiring that they be vaccinated or face weekly testing, in what he hoped would be a model for other employers, a spokesman said. The mayor urged private employers to follow suit.</p><p>The increase in Covid-19 cases and the rise of the Delta variant over the summer led many firms to push back their return-to-office dates into October. Some, including Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Amazon.com Inc., said employees wouldn't be back until January. Other businesses are mandating vaccinations and requiring employees to wear masks in common areas.</p><p>The seven-day average of new cases in New York City decreased to 1,634 as of Sunday, down from an August peak of 1,968 but well above the average of 196 new cases on June 24, when the state ended its emergency declaration. That figure peaked at more than 6,400 in early January, according to city statistics.</p><p>The seven-day average number of hospitalizations in the city has fallen to 58 as of Sunday from an August peak of 114. It was over 300 in January and February of this year, city data show. More than 65% of city residents have received at least one vaccine dose, according to the city.</p><p>To foster a return to normalcy, city officials said they are planning to reopen schools Sept. 13 and have mandated vaccination for educators and other city employees.</p><p>Many executives said they are monitoring a mix of variables and re-evaluating plans.</p><p>\"We had a pretty good plan going, and then this Delta variant popped up,\" said Richard Rosenbaum, executive chairman of the law firm Greenberg Traurig LLP. He was hoping to have its employees spend a majority of time in the office starting Oct. 1.</p><p>He added: \"At the moment, we're keeping it loose, but I think we will see a directional shift of being back to the office, without as hard a deadline, by the end of the year.\"</p><p>White-collar employees in Manhattan's offices are essential to keeping restaurants and other service businesses going, business groups said. </p><p>Google, with about 11,000 employees in New York, has pushed its return to the office to January.

While Morgan Stanley doesn't have an official return-to-work date, employees have gradually come back to the office over the summer, and the firm expects an upward trajectory to continue, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>Citigroup Inc. plans to bring back roughly 10,000 workers to its lower-Manhattan headquarters on a rotating basis Sept. 13. \"But that could always change if the conditions change,\" said Edward Skyler, the bank's head of public affairs.</p><p>\"We pore over the latest data on a weekly basis,\" he said. \"We also are constantly talking to our people to get a sense of their comfort level.\"</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. have required employees to be in the office since June and July, respectively. Goldman requires workers to be vaccinated, and JPMorgan recently said employees must wear masks in common areas.</p><p>Technology companies have been more willing to continue their remote operations. Amazon's 5,000 New York employees aren't due back until Jan. 3, and Google, which has about 11,000 employees in New York, said last week that it was pushing back its return to the office from October to Jan. 10.</p><p>Google's announcement was a blow for Tír Na Nóg, an Irish pub on 31st Street that frequently draws an after-work crowd from the company's nearby office, said Helen Woods, the restaurant's director of operations. It expects to reopen a renovated location on 39th Street in September, but will do so with less staff because fewer workers in the neighborhood mean less business.</p><p>\"We use Google as our barometer,\" she said. \"It's disappointing, but we'll just struggle through somehow.\"</p><p>Employment in the city's restaurants and bars is still about 120,000 people below pre-pandemic levels, said Andrew Rigie of the New York City Hospitality Alliance.</p><p>The occupancy rate for New York City hotels in the week ended Aug. 21 was 63.5%, up from 41.2% in the same period in 2020, but still not at the pre-pandemic level of 90.2% in 2019, according to the hospitality data tracking firm STR. Vijay Dandapani, president and chief executive of the Hotel Association of New York City, said hotels have seen some cancellations for September.</p><p>There are signs of optimism. Broadway theaters are planning to open more productions in coming weeks, although all adult patrons must be vaccinated. While the New York International Auto Show was canceled, there are 35 events booked at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center through the end of the year, a facility spokesman said.</p><p>Scott Rechler, chief executive of the developer and property manager RXR Realty, said he was frustrated by the slow pace of return.</p><p>\"You have to calibrate to what that risk is and to what the costs are to our communities and our downtowns,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Jimmy Vielkind at Jimmy.Vielkind@wsj.com</p><p>Labor Day Return to Normal in New York Is Tripped Up by Delta Variant</p>",
