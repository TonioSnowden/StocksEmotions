  "title": "VC Daily: Europe Catching Up to U.S. in Early-Stage Deals",
  "text": "<p>When looking specifically at early-stage, Europe accounted for 33% of all capital invested globally this year into deals of below $5 million in size, pretty much on par with the U.S., according to the report. Europe's proportion increased from 18% in 2010 and 26% in 2015.</p><p>\"The increasing share of funding in smaller rounds globally going to Europe is a leading indicator of the strength and potential of the European company pipeline,\" said Sarah Guemouri, a senior associate at Atomico and co-author of the report.</p><p>European tech startups raised $3.8 billion in aggregate via such smaller-sized deals, compared with about $4.1 billion by U.S. startups, through the end of September, according to the report. (The data includes the U.K. and excludes Israel.) Europe's global share of sub-$10 million rounds has been increasing over time, as well, the report said.</p><p>Another important metric that can help predict the potential of a venture market, according to the Atomico report, is the experience and size of its entrepreneur talent pool.</p><p>Atomico and Dealroom found, for example, that about 2,000 people who had been employed by the 15 largest European unicorns went on to launch their own companies. Since there are many more unicorns in Europe that are growing fast, it can be expected that they will spawn even more new companies, the report said.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Fundraising. Greycroft is raising a pair of funds, including its first-ever pool that could total $1 billion, according to people familiar with the situation, Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports. The New York- and Los Angeles-based venture investor, which backs consumer, enterprise-software, fintech and digital-health startups, is planning to raise about $1 billion for its fourth fund focused on later-stage deals, as well as about $500 million for its seventh main early-stage fund, according to people familiar with the situation.</p><p>Ian Sigalow, co-founder of the firm, declined to comment.</p><p>The rapid growth in startup valuations is leading venture firms to roll out massive funds to keep up and maintain their stakes in their high performers at the later stages.</p><p>In the U.S., 19 venture funds of $1 billion or more collected $38.7 billion in aggregate this year through the third quarter, representing about 40% of all fundraising by U.S. venture firms, according to research firm PitchBook Data Inc.</p><p>Children's Finance App Greenlight Names CFO as It Prepares for IPO</p><p>Greenlight Financial Technology Inc., the maker of an app that helps children budget, save and invest, appointed its first permanent finance chief as it prepares to go public in the next 12 to 18 months, WSJ's Mark Maurer reports. The Atlanta-based company, which generates revenue largely by selling monthly subscriptions to families that use its services, said that Brian Dong took on the chief financial officer role last month.

Greenlight, founded in 2014, has raised more than $550 million in venture-capital funding, including $260 million from a Series D round in April led by venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.</p><p>Chinese AI Leader SenseTime Launches Scaled-Back IPO</p><p>Chinese artificial-intelligence company SenseTime Group Inc. said Monday it plans to raise up to $767 million in a Hong Kong initial public offering this month, pushing ahead with its listing plans despite a rout in Chinese technology stocks and a subsidiary's inclusion on a U.S. export blacklist, The Wall Street Journal reports. The seven-year-old company earlier aimed to raise up to $2 billion in its IPO, according to people familiar with the matter. Its scaled-back offering is backed by nine so-called cornerstone investors, including major Chinese state-owned companies and investment funds, which will purchase 60% of the shares being sold.</p><p>Industry News</p><p>Funds</p><p>Israeli seed-stage investor lool ventures held the first $60 million close of its third fund, which is targeting $100 million, and seeks to back approximately 20 companies.
