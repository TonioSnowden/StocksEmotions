  "title": "Global Trade Hit by Ukraine War, China Lockdowns; European consumers curb spending as energy prices surge; Chinese factories slow as authorities battle Covid-19 outbreaks",
  "text": "<p>Trade flows, some economists said, are being dented by wilting demand from European consumers grappling with the onslaught of surging energy prices and by the lockdowns in major cities Shanghai and Shenzhen that slowed production at Chinese factories. While the U.S. appetite for imports has held up, the economists said, inflation and rising interest rates are likely to bite into consumer spending.</p><p>Challenges on the trade front are a sign of a darkening global economic outlook and are hitting governments dealing with the fallout from the Ukraine war, which is disrupting supplies of essential commodities such as grains, oil and metals. Central banks, meantime, are trying to raise interest rates to tame inflation without crashing growth.</p><p>Finance ministers and central-bank chiefs gather in Washington, D.C., next week to discuss the multiplying problems as the world economy is pitched for lower growth this year than in 2021.</p><p>\"Less trade is one more reason to expect global growth to throttle way back this year,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.</p><p>In its latest projections, published Tuesday, the World Trade Organization said it expects the global economy to expand 2.8% in 2022, weaker than the 3% average between 2010 and 2019. It forecasts global trade in goods to grow just 3%, after adjusting for price changes, compared with 9.8% in 2021. The WTO cited the trade disruptions in essential goods due to the Ukraine war and lockdowns in China that \"are again disrupting seaborne trade at a time when supply chain pressures appeared to be easing.\"</p><p>Surveys of manufacturing activity show exports sagging in Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, producers of the chips, high-end electronics and machinery that propelled a trade bonanza in 2021 as Covid-19 vaccines and lavish stimulus helped the global economy roar back to life.</p><p>In China, the government's zero-tolerance approach to stamping out Covid-19 outbreaks is squeezing consumer spending and hurting factory output in an economy that was already grappling with a real-estate crunch and a widening regulatory crackdown on tech and other industries.</p><p>Chinese export growth slowed to an annual 15% in March, from 16% in January and February combined, China's customs bureau reported Wednesday. Official data combine the first two months of the year to try to smooth out big swings in activity around Lunar New Year, a major holiday in China and many parts of Asia. Economists say that can still leave the picture skewed, and tend to make their own statistical adjustments to account for the break, which this year fell in early February.</p><p>Julian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said that after his seasonal adjustments, he estimates Chinese exports in March were down 6% from February. Taking into account the effect of higher export prices due to surging commodity prices, Mr. Evans-Pritchard said in a note to clients that his calculations point to the largest contraction in Chinese export volumes since the pandemic hit in early 2020.</p><p>Growth in exports to the European Union and Southeast Asia slowed, as did exports to Russia, as Western sanctions disrupted its trade with the rest of the world. Growth in exports to the U.S. picked up.</p><p>Angus Lin, a trading manager at Wenzhou Dian Pet Products Co., said logistics logjams as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak in Shanghai have forced delays in shipments to foreign customers, while orders from Europe have declined following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your outlook for the global economy? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The pet-toys supplier, based in Wenzhou, in China's Zhejiang province, mainly exports to North America, South America and Europe through the huge ports at Shanghai, around 285 miles away, and Ningbo, around 180 miles away. Road closures and other restrictions meant to stem infections have made it tricky to get deliveries to the port on time.</p><p>\"Almost all the orders have been affected these days,\" he said.</p><p>In another sign of the gathering headwinds to global trade, Chinese imports fell as the country's worst Covid-19 outbreak in two years led to lockdowns in regions as far-flung as Jilin in the northeast and the technology hub of Shenzhen in the south, keeping millions at home. As factories' production slowed, so did demand for components. Authorities have taken small steps to ease the lockdown in Shanghai, China's most populous city, but restrictions continue to disrupt the flow of goods through the city.</p><p>Imports in March were down 0.1% from a year earlier, customs data showed, China's first annual fall in imports since August 2020. Imports from the EU and the U.S. both declined.</p><p>\"Imports falling outright is very bad for global trade,\" said Craig Botham, chief China economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.</p><p>Imports from Russia were up 26% in March, slowing from the January-February pace of 36%. Analysts said that after taking account of higher energy prices, imports from Russia likely declined in March, suggesting China didn't step up purchases of Russian oil shunned by the West.</p><p>Adjusting for the holidays and inflation, Mr. Evans-Pritchard said he estimates overall import volumes in March fell 10% from February.</p><p>The downbeat signals emerging from Asia's export powerhouses mark a switch from the recent past when global trade served as the engine for the region's recovery from the depths of the pandemic in 2020.</p><p>\"This is a region that has thrived on trade,\" said Aaditya Mattoo, chief economist for East Asia and the Pacific at the World Bank.</p><p>Russia's assault on Ukraine and the Western sanctions in response have driven steep increases in commodity and energy prices, pushing up companies' costs as well as disrupting supply chains and dampening demand in Europe. Consumers there face not only higher gasoline prices but steeply higher home energy bills as a result of the soaring cost of natural gas.</p><p>For other Asian exporters, China's battle against Covid-19's Omicron variant means fewer orders from Chinese factories for chips and other components used in electronics and vehicles, as well as softer Chinese demand for their own finished products. Surveys of purchasing managers at manufacturers in Taiwan, South Korea and Japan this month all recorded the sharpest drops in export orders in almost two years.</p><p>Official trade data for Taiwan and South Korea are similarly downbeat. Adjusting for the Lunar New Year and other seasonal effects, economists at Goldman Sachs calculated that Taiwan's exports in March were down 9% from February, while South Korea's were up just 0.5%.</p><p>South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co. said this month that overseas sales in March were down 14% from a year earlier as the company battled supply-chain problems, including the shutdown of a factory in Russia.</p><p>\"We are definitely going through a rough patch,\" said Brian Tan, regional economist for Asia at Barclays in Singapore. \"It is going to be fairly choppy, especially in the next few months as China is clearing up the outbreak.\"</p><p>Bingyan Wang and Grace Zhu in Beijing and Kwanwoo Jun in Singapore contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jason Douglas at jason.douglas@wsj.com</p><p>Global Trade Hit by Ukraine War, China Lockdowns</p>",
