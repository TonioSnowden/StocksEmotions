  "text": "<p>The losses looked set to continue on Thursday, and analysts are looking at the strength of the U.S. dollar DXY — up to a nine-month high — as one factor why.</p><p>https://twitter.com/HedgeInsider/status/1428287342004088840Kit Juckes, macro strategist at Société Générale, said he thinks short-term interest rates BX:TMUBMUSD02Y are what's moving markets.</p><p>“Chances are that the dollar will go on benefiting from the focus on the Fed, but can't go very far, given how far away the first rate still is. Maybe that means that the real driver will be positioning — the speculative market was bearish and short of the dollar a few months ago and is now square, at least, if not already long,” he wrote.</p><p>“I'm tempted to think that the recent pattern of marginal new highs by the dollar followed by a period of choppy trading, will continue, and will edge EURUSD EURUSD down to 1.16, or even a bit below that, in the coming couple of weeks,” he said.</p><p>Marshall Gittler, head of investment research at BDSwiss Holding, noted the dollar's strength even as bond yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y fell. “That either means the dollar is trading as a safe-haven currency — which it hasn't been recently — or it's the famous ‘monetary policy divergence' theme in play. If the latter, that would suggest further dollar strength on the horizon,” he said.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>A new U.K. study based on the country's real-world experience found diminished effectiveness from coronavirus vaccines to the delta variant, and also found that the initial outperformance of two doses of the vaccine from Pfizer PFE and BioNTech BNTX eroded after four to five months to the level of two doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca AZN vaccine. Separately, economists at Goldman Sachs lowered their third-quarter U.S. growth forecast to 5.5% from 9%, though they raised their expectations for the next four quarters.</p><p>The economics docket includes the latest weekly jobless claims figures, and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index for August.</p><p>Retailers Macy's M and Kohl's KSS each handily beat earnings forecasts. After the close, chip-equipment maker Applied Materials AMAT reports results.</p><p>Robinhood Markets HOOD slumped, as the online broker issued a cautious outlook, saying third-quarter trading volumes would be lower.</p><p>Graphics microchip maker Nvidia NVDA rose in after-hours trade after reporting record data-center and gaming revenue, as it struggles to complete the acquisition of microchip designer ARM from SoftBank.</p><p>Goldman Sachs GS reached a $1.9 billion deal to buy NN Investment Partners, which has $355 billion in assets under supervision.</p><p>The markets</p><p>More red on the screen as U.S. stock futures ES00NQ00 traded lower.</p><p>Crude-oil CL.1 and copper HG00 futures each slumped by 3%.
