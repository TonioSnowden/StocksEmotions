  "title": "Boohoo blames ‘transient' factors for major profit warning",
  "text": "<p><strong>Boohoo</strong> is jumping on the “transitory” bandwagon with a major profit warning this morning. </p> <p>The fast-fashion chain warned that “transient” factors “currently negatively affecting the business” meant that sales growth for the year to February is likely to be half the amount of a previous estimate, while adjusted profit margins will be one-third lower than earlier guidance. </p> <p>“Significantly higher” returns rates have hit net sales growth and costs, Boohoo said. Disruption to international deliveries have also affected demand and, in addition, cost inflation was biting, Boohoo said. Those factors could be compounded if Omicron weakens demand and increases returns rates in January and February. </p> <p>Boohoo had previously guided for an increase in net sales of 20-25 per cent for the year, and adjusted ebitda margins of 9-9.5 per cent. Now it expects net sales growth of 12-14 per cent and margins of 6-7 per cent. </p> <p>One-off cash costs will also be higher than expected at £33m rather than £22.5m due to “warehouse and new brand restructuring”. Boohoo has snapped up failed high-street brands, including Debenhams, although not their stores.</p> <p>But Boohoo reiterated “medium-term” margin guidance of 10 per cent adjusted ebitda. </p> <p><em>Do you buy that Boohoo's problems are indeed “transient” or is it fast-fashion, fast-growth model coming apart at the seams? Let me know at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"mailto:citybulletin@ft.com\"><em>citybulletin@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>And do </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/top-stories-today?emailId=61b99d7483988700049291de&amp;segmentId=269ab16c-599f-119f-3d76-260b55fc8e43\"><em>check out</em></a><em> Top Stories Today for today's&#xa0;top headlines in a short-form audio digest.</em></p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>The <strong>FCA</strong> fined <strong>GAM</strong> £9.1m and one of its star fund managers £230,000 over a conflict of interest scandal at the Swiss fund manager. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e467b10-5203-4cd1-a7d0-b9b2dba740be#post-b9a2f850-c0b9-4339-9810-f301284a811e\">Our correspondents report</a> on how the scandal at GAM, which centred on Tim Haywood's purchase of illiquid debt linked to metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta and Australian financier Lex Greensill, sent the manager's share price and assets under management tumbling. </p> <p>The Rothermere family has secured victory in its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ed85474-e1a1-4347-b8ee-af8542cf4809\">attempt to take</a> <strong>Daily Mail and General Trust</strong> private. It now has the backing of holders of almost 57 per cent of the media group's shares, above the 50 per cent threshold needed to delist the company from the public market. But unless that climbs above 90 per cent, the Rothermeres will be stuck with minority shareholders in the privatised DMGT. </p> <p><strong>Pearson </strong>has recruited the former executive chair of Twitter and chief business officer of Google as its new chair, underscoring the education group's shift to tech. <strong>Omid Kordestani</strong>, a Silicon Valley veteran, will join the board in March and take over as chair in April. His appointment comes 18 months after the group brought in former Disney executive Andy Bird as chief executive to turn around the group. He is trying to shift Pearson to a direct-to-student subscription model.</p> <p><strong>Domino's Pizza Group</strong> reached an agreement with its franchisees after a long-running dispute and increased medium-term expectations for sales and store openings. Domino's committed to a programme of investment and an “enhanced” rebate mechanism to encourage order growth, while franchisees agreed to a more ambitious schedule of store openings and promotions.</p> <p>Also out today are updates from <strong>The Gym Group</strong>, music back-catalogue buyer <strong>Hipgnosis Songs Fund Limited</strong>, and insurer <strong>Aviva</strong>, which extended its buyback programme from £750m to £1bn.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>The UK government is discouraging working from the office but encouraging office parties (and they have shown how much they support such parties over the past week). <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d055d4da-d85f-41a0-b63f-e7b20d623008\">taking the opposite approach</a>. Executives there want staff in the office, but not out making merry. The Wall Street Bank has ordered teams in New York that haven't already held their festive dinners and other internal events to cancel. Compliance may be higher than in No. 10.</p> <p>More <strong>blacklist</strong> news: <strong>Wuxi Biologics</strong>, the Chinese biotechnology group, sought to reassure investors by saying it might repurchase up to $500m in shares after worries that the US government might place it on an “entity list”, William Langley <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e467b10-5203-4cd1-a7d0-b9b2dba740be\">reports from Hong Kong</a>. Biotech companies have come into focus as the next potential targets for the Biden administration's US investment blacklist. </p> <p>And <strong>Reddit</strong>, the online discussion forum, has begun the process of seeking a stock market listing, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf69adbc-2d1b-4a33-86c7-e1fa04b3a0dc\">Richard Waters reports</a>. The platform has attracted controversy as a free speech haven where users can appear under pseudonyms — though personally, I mainly know it for its <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/\">AITA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/971df303-726a-4bdf-93eb-9a9e848f7109\">r/WallStreetBets</a>&#xa0;message boards, the latter of which fuelled the meme stock trading boom earlier this year. Reddit has yet to determine how many shares it will sell or a likely price range. It put its valuation at $10bn at the time of its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0029521a-0cb1-400b-9723-a248b4d3ff2d\">last fundraising round</a> in August. </p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>Two things to recommend today. The first is my column (because if I don't tell you to read it, who will): this week it is on why in the mire of <strong>crypto regulation</strong>, we shouldn't be leaving it to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37f215c9-958a-4de8-8d45-17071a630298\">advertising watchdog</a> to mop up the mess. </p> <p>Second is this excellent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d98faaab-0290-49a8-80c3-a65d8ae43608\">Lex Letter from London</a> from my colleague Vanessa Houlder, about the <strong>money-laundering scandal</strong> for which NatWest was fined £265m this week — and the problem of the huge numbers of suspicious transaction reports generated by “rear-covering” institutions that overwhelm the capacity of those meant to be analysing them. </p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'Boohoo blames ‘transient' factors for major profit warning' FT.com 16 December.
