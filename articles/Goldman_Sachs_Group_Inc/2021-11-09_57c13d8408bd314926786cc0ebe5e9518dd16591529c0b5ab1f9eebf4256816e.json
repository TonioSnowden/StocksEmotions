  "title": "What Do Climate Summits Actually Achieve? Students discuss if the COP26 summit is doing any good.",
  "text": "<p>Climate summits could be instrumental in fighting climate change—if they were conducted in an honest way. COP26 shows that these types of gatherings are often purely symbolic. World leaders participate to appeal to their constituents by giving the appearance of taking action and being important. Meanwhile, ambiguous, easy-to-accomplish long-term goals are set, with no accountability. If China and other world polluters actually attended, and if the meetings produced significant agreements that could be submitted as legislation and implemented quickly, we would be better off in the fight against climate change.</p><p>—Isaac Speights, University of North Texas, psychology</p><p>The Sponsors of Climate</p><p>The COP26 summit is a disenchanting exhibition of corporate semantics and international posturing. It is hardly surprising that a conference sponsored by multinational corporations—technology giant Microsoft and Scottish pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, for example—would eschew radicalism. As difficult as it would be to quantify the effect of these sponsorships, we cannot suppose that such partners as the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi and the British grocery chain Sainsbury's have nothing to gain. At the least, these companies can present themselves as adjacent to climate-change activism and gain reputationally, regardless of whether they lead their respective industries in sustainable practices.</p><p>—Luca Zislin, University of California, Berkeley, political science and English</p><p>Who is Really Green?</p><p>For Greta Thunberg, the COP26 climate summit has been a \"two-week long celebration of business as usual.\" Politicians have bloviated about the consequences of inaction while cutting back-room deals for raw materials, even as celebrities chartered jets to speak about \"multi-stakeholder decarbonization initiatives.\"</p><p>Ms. Thunberg's cynicism about climate theater is not misplaced. China and Russia have been notably absent. Political scientists tend to view with deep suspicion such nonbinding agreements as those reached at COP26 on deforestation. Everyone agrees it is untenable to ask developing nations to halt development for the sake of reducing global emissions.</p><p>If incentives for international cooperation are misaligned, and global conferences are so much pomp and circumstance, where should we look for signs of progress? We might look to the activities of state and local governments, and NGOs, as well as capital-market dynamics. Washington state recently passed carbon-pricing legislation meant to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Since its inception in 1987, Conservation International has helped protect more than 601 million hectares (1.485 billion acres) of land and sea across the globe. Finally, we should note that assets under environmental, social and governance investment management are on track to exceed $50 trillion by 2025.</p><p>There are still people—like Ms. Thunberg—who insist that the only way forward is to reduce human consumption, and these degrowthers remain dubious about corporate greenwashing. Meanwhile, the public remains frustrated by political incrementalism. But progress is increasingly culturally prestigious and financially profitable.</p><p>—Addis Goldman, University of Chicago, international relations</p><p>Small Steps</p><p>There is at least some power in words. Actions may speak louder, but if words spur action, then breath isn't wasted. Climate summits run the risk of being simple celebrations of feel-goodism. But people can be inspired by such rhetoric to make changes in their communities, write to their lawmakers and amend their personal habits. We need people who are passionate about preventing further climate change, and we need them to act on their opinions. COP26 does good when it encourages people to make small steps that can add up to something big.</p><p>—Leigh Fisher, New York University, integrated design and media</p><p>The Climate Competition</p><p>Collaboration is a valuable tool to solve climate issues, but we tend to underestimate the importance of international competition. In a world of self-interested states, rivalry and nationalistic ideals can also inspire progress, as shown by the scientific accomplishments of the space race.</p><p>Climate summits have a problem with free-riders and with countries (Russia, for example) that see climate change as a potential positive. Paradoxically, the only way to bring these countries together is by turning environmentalism into a competition in which countries view climate progress as a mark of national pride, and as a pathway to controlling the energy supply of the future. Such motives may be less altruistic than collaboration, but they will prove far more compelling for the majority of countries.</p><p>—Thomas Brodey, Amherst College, history</p><p>Click here to submit a response to next week's Future View.</p><p>If you are interested in an internship with The Wall Street Journal, applications are open.
