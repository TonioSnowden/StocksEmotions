  "text": "<p>\"First, by running Lowercarbon Capital as a fund, we're showing the world that climate tech investments can be evaluated on their profit potential alone,\" Mr. Sacca says he wrote to his investors.</p><p>There is already evidence that the performance of recent investments in this sector is much better than it was in the years of the clean-tech bubble in the late 2000s.</p><p>The total value of investments made into U.S. clean-tech companies between 2015 and 2019 went up by 80% as of the end of 2020, according to data from investment and advisory firm Cambridge Associates. That's compared with declining value overall for investments made in the sector between 2005 and 2009.</p><p>The pooled gross investment rate of return, another key metric for investment performance, was 22.7% for investments made in U.S. clean-tech companies between 2015 and 2019, per Cambridge Associates, compared with a negative IRR for investments made a decade prior.</p><p>The climate-tech and clean-tech industry appears to be on an upward trajectory.</p><p>And now on to the news.</p><p>Top News</p><p>Oil giants turn to startups. Energy giants including BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC are bolstering their venture-capital arms—increasing budgets, hiring more staff and doing more deals—seeking out new low-carbon technologies to help future-proof their profits, The Wall Street Journal's Sarah McFarlane reports. The moves come as several big oil companies work to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and expand their low-carbon activities, partly in response to growing pressure from investors and governments to cut emissions.</p><p>Venture spending by oil companies represents only a small amount of their multibillion-dollar annual investment budgets. It is also sometimes aimed at boosting oil-and-gas operations, while some clean-tech entrepreneurs can be reluctant to sell to fossil fuel companies.</p><p>Nevertheless, BP, Shell and French peer TotalEnergies SE are now among the most active clean-tech investors by number of deals closed, according to data provider PitchBook.</p><p>Companies Are Hoarding Record Cash Amid Delta Fears</p><p>Companies are sitting on a record amount of cash amid lingering uncertainty about disruptions from Covid-19, defying expectations earlier this year that a waning pandemic would unleash a spending spree, the Journal's Anna Hirtenstein reports. Cash and short-term investments on corporate balance sheets globally are at an all-time high of $6.84 trillion, according to data from S&amp;P Global, extrapolated from second-quarter earnings reports. That is 45% higher than the average in the five years preceding the pandemic and a 2.6% increase from the previous quarter.</p><p>Allbirds to Sell Wool and Tree-Based Workout Clothes, Taking on Nike and Lululemon</p><p>Allbirds Inc., known for its eco-friendly sneakers, is betting people want to work out in wool. The startup is launching a new line of athletic gear made of merino wool and yarn created from the pulp of eucalyptus trees, the Journal's Suzanne Kapner reports. The fabric, which was two years in the making, is Allbirds' latest attempt to rethink the apparel industry's longstanding reliance on polyester and other synthetic fibers. Allbirds' effort to get people to wear wool shoes was a resounding success, as its sneakers quickly became a favorite in Silicon Valley. It now has to sell consumers on the merits of working up a sweat in leggings made of similar materials, while competing in a sector dominated by Lululemon Athletica Inc., Nike Inc. and other companies that tout lightweight, moisture-wicking gear.</p><p>InfoSum Raises $65 Million as Companies Prioritize Data Privacy</p><p>InfoSum Ltd. has raised a $65 million Series B funding round, as the data technology startup aims to support companies' growing need for customer-data services that adhere to stricter privacy rules, WSJ's Alexandra Bruell reports. The funding, entirely from U.K.-based investment firm Chrysalis Investments Ltd., will enable the company to increase its head count and global presence as it plans for an initial public offering in the next five years, said InfoSum Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Brian Lesser. InfoSum sees an opportunity to boost growth as companies rely on new techniques for collecting data amid tighter privacy regulations and a rise in digital media consumption and e-commerce, Mr. Lesser said.</p><p>Industry News</p><p>People</p><p>M12 appointed Michael Stewart as the firm's newest investment partner. Based in San Francisco, Mr. Stewart will focus on early-stage investments in deeptech and enterprise software in North America. He was most recently an investment director at Applied Ventures.</p><p>Fintech investor Nyca Partners said Tom Brown is joining the firm as a partner. He was most recently a partner at Paul Hastings.</p><p>Solidia Technologies, which helps manufacturers produce building and construction materials using low-carbon cement and concrete, named Russell Hill to the post of chief technology officer.
