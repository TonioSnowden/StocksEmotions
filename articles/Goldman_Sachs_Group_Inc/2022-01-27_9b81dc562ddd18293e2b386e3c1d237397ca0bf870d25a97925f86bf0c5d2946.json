  "title": "Growth-Equity Leverage Risk Could Rise, Goldman's Waldron Warns; Negative economic trends could undermine valuations, the Goldman Sachs executive says",
  "text": "<p>Those trends could create risks for \"growthy, venture-style equity\" investments, which, in addition to private credit, have seen \"the biggest expansion of money flows\" in recent years, Mr. Waldron said. \"There's leverage that supports those valuations that assumed an enterprise value that you know may in fact be dramatically lower.\"</p><p>The long-running shift in capital to alternative investments is driven by investor interest in getting higher returns that aren't tied to fluctuations in traditional markets, according to Mr. Waldron.</p><p>In the past \"handful of years,\" most of the increase in alternative-asset investments \"has been in credit and then what I would call growth equity as opposed to traditional private equity\" deals, Mr. Waldron said. Typically private-equity buyouts involve majority stakes, while growth-equity transactions involve minority positions.</p><p>He said that he expects investors will continue to back growth-equity deals and that economic growth will remain strong this year.</p><p>\"The asset-price revaluation that we are seeing only makes those assets more attractive if you have fresh capital to invest in, so you are going to see a lot more thrust towards growth equity,\" he said.</p><p>But Mr. Waldron expects the rise in private credit investing to slow.</p><p>\"You are going to see some credit spread widening and a little bit more variability in performance around credit, particularly if we get a little bit slower growth in the economy and we get higher rates,\" he said. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday signaled intentions to raise short-term interest rates in mid-March, the latest turn toward removing stimulus to temper elevated inflation.</p><p>Real estate and infrastructure remain attractive asset classes, Mr. Waldron said. Real estate struggled to attract capital through the Covid-19 pandemic because \"there was a sense that commercial real estate would really suffer\" from dislocations, he said.</p><p>\"We haven't seen that and so we're more bullish on real estate than maybe would be the average investor,\" Mr. Waldron said.</p><p>Infrastructure is in need of a \"tremendous amount of investment\" globally and is likely to attract a lot of capital in countries like the U.S., Mr. Waldron said: \"We're big bulls on infrastructure.\"</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com</p>",
