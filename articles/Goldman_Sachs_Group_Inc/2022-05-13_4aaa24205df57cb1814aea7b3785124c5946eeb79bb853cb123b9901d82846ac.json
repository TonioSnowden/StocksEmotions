  "title": "Business News:  Chinese Developer  Misses Bond Payment  ----  By Rebecca Feng",
  "text": "<p>   Sunac China, once one of the country's best-performing developers, failed to make an overdue interest payment on a U.S. dollar bond, marking a comedown for founder Sun Hongbin, who had tried for months to prevent his property giant from spiraling into default. </p><p>   Tianjin-based Sunac on Thursday said it couldn't cobble together enough money to make a $29.5 million bond-coupon payment by the end of a 30-day grace period. The nonpayment could trigger cross-defaults on Sunac's international bonds with a total face value of $7.7 billion, according to the note's prospectus. </p><p>   The company's international-bond default would further dampen investors' confidence in the property sector. Before this month, 17 Chinese developers with a total of $51.4 billion in hard-currency debt had defaulted since the start of 2021, according to a Goldman Sachs research report. </p><p>   Sunac's fall was surprisingly swift. The 18-year-old developer had raised money from a dollar bond sale as recently as last July, a time when bond investors and global credit raters were confident about its ability to avoid the financial troubles of debt-laden peers including China Evergrande Group and Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. The two industry giants defaulted on their international debt in December after months of liquidity problems. </p><p>   A resulting industrywide property downturn across China and a shutdown in bond-market financing, however, turned out to be too difficult for Sunac to navigate. Recent downgrades by international rating companies have also hindered its efforts to obtain funding, it said. Covid-19 outbreaks this year across the country, which worsened a sales slump, dealt it yet another blow. </p><p>   \"The Group would like to express sincere apologies for not being able to fulfill its debt obligations as scheduled,\" Sunac said in a statement. </p><p>   It asked creditors to give it time to overcome its challenges. The company has appointed a unit of restructuring firm Houlihan Lokey as its financial adviser, and Sidley Austin as its legal adviser. It is trying to come up with a solution for its offshore debts. </p><p>   Sunac is also working to bring in state-owned strategic investors, according to a person familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Sunac hasn't published its 2021 annual results and trading for its Hong Kong-listed shares has been suspended since April 1. </p><p>   Sunac was among China's five largest property developers by contracted sales over the past few years, according to CRIC, an industry-data provider. That abruptly changed in 2022, as major Chinese cities entered various forms of lockdowns. </p><p></p>",
