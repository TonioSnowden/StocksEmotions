  "text": "<p>ARK Innovation ARKK was down about 3.9% Monday afternoon, increasing 2021 losses to about 14%, according to FactSet data, at last check.

The recently launched ETF began trading last month.</p><p>Many investors have been expressing concern over valuations in tech, questioning whether the U.S. stock market is bound for a correction after repeatedly hitting new record highs earlier this year.

Market technicians traditionally define a correction as a drop from a recent peak of at least 10%.</p><p>“It's a good opportunity to make sure you've got your risk in check now because some of the biggest, fiercest drops have happened in October,” Phillip Toews, chief executive officer of Toews Asset Management, said in a phone interview Monday. “Don't dither.”</p><p>Read:Beware ‘unrealistic complacency' in stock market, Morgan Stanley warns</p><p>Market volatility has picked up during an “seasonally unfavorable period” for U.S. stocks and after a recent rise in Treasury rates, said Toews.

The S&amp;P 500 indexSPX, which has a large exposure to technology, lost 2.2% last week, similarly booking its biggest drop since late February.</p><p>See:‘Something will give' in U.S. stock market amid ‘discomforting sentiment signals,' Citi warns</p><p>On Monday afternoon, the S&amp;P 500 was down around 1.5%, with declines led by the information technology sector XX:SP500.45, FactSet data show. The Dow Jones Industrial Average index DJIA, a blue-chip gauge of the U.S. stock market, was also down, but faring better than the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq.</p>",
