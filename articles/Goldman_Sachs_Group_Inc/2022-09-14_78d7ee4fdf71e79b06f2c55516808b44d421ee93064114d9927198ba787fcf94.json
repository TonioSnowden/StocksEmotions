  "title": "Peloton Becomes CEO McCarthy's Ride or Die",
  "text": "<p>The former chief financial officer of Netflix and Spotify took the top spot at the troubled connected fitness pioneer seven months ago, kicking off a turnaround effort aimed at salvaging Peloton's business following a sharp reversal of fortune. The onset of the pandemic sent the company's growth into triple-digit territory, but strategic missteps and a rapid cooling of demand as fitness buffs rediscover gyms combined to give Peloton a serious case of road rash.</p><p>The company's revenue has fallen by double-digit percentages over the past two quarters on a year-over-year basis, and Peloton has projected that subscriber growth will be flat for the first time ever in the current fiscal first quarter ending this month.</p><p>The latter is a particularly sharp challenge for Mr. McCarthy, who is trying to meld Peloton into the image of his former employers as a subscriber-focused business, rather than one that generates the majority of its revenue through the sale of premium exercise gear. Now, the exit of founders so closely associated with the original Peloton vision could give Mr. McCarthy a clearer shot at executing on the transition.</p><p>The company announced late Monday that co-founder and former Chief Executive John Foley resigned from his position as executive board chairman while another co-founder, Hisao Kushi, resigned from his position of chief legal officer. Peloton said in a filing that Mr. Foley's departure wasn't due to any disagreements and he has entered into a \"founder transition plan,\" by which he will receive severance payments and has entered into a noncompete agreement for one year.</p><p>But investors didn't exactly signal confidence in Mr. McCarthy vision, as Peloton's shares sank about 10% on Tuesday. This came not only after the departure of the two founders, but also on the heels of extensive comment by Mr. McCarthy on Monday afternoon outlining his strategy at an investment conference sponsored by Goldman Sachs. Mr. McCarthy said he believes the company can expand its addressable market by leaning further into its service and offering a wider variety of options for its equipment.</p><p>A newly expanded rental program announced on Tuesday morning further underscores that effort; customers can now get a Peloton Bike and access to its connected fitness classes for $89 a month, as opposed to laying out $1,445 for the bike itself and $44 a month for all-access membership.</p><p>At the heart of Mr. McCarthy's plan is for Peloton to spread well beyond the confines of whatever equipment it sells; he spoke Tuesday of his hope to \"enable purchasers of competitive hardware to be able to use our content on their devices.\" And when it comes to products, he reiterated his \"good, better, best\" strategy that equates Peloton to something of a diverse car dealership that sells a Mercedes to top-paying members but it can also offer used products with fewer features for those who don't want or can't afford the top shelf.</p><p>But one of the reasons that people buy Mercedes cars is to differentiate themselves from those who cannot. Can Mr. McCarthy reasonably expect a customer to pay thousands of dollars for a \"premium\" treadmill or bike brand, when that same brand is also being offered for a low monthly fee? Peloton has always fancied its mission as bringing quality exercise to the masses, but its business to date has really hinged on bringing quality exercise to the elite. Peloton has yet to prove it can get the masses to sign on while keeping the elites on their bikes as well.</p>",
