  "title": "Daniel Enriquez Thrived Through a Changing New York. He Died in a Subway Shooting. Longtime Goldman Sachs worker spent decades diving into city life, both on Wall Street and in Brooklyn",
  "text": "<p>For years, the younger Mr. Enriquez, a longtime employee of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., thrived in the city's economic and cultural revival. Last month he was shot and killed by a stranger while riding the subway to Sunday brunch. He was 48 years old.</p><p>Violence in New York has crept up since the onset of the pandemic. The trend has been broad, encompassing attacks on police, people of Asian descent and low-income and Black and Hispanic communities.</p><p>Assaults on subways, mundane microcosms in which residents mix with commuters and tourists, have struck a particular chord. Mr. Enriquez's slaying follows a mass shooting in a Brooklyn subway station in April and a spate of people being pushed onto tracks. The attacks are fueling the perception that the city is unsafe, making some workers reluctant to return to the office and potentially hampering New York's economic recovery.</p><p>Mr. Enriquez embraced city life upon his return. He landed a job on Wall Street and found love and friendship in Williamsburg's bars and galleries. He watched his once-blighted neighborhood transform into a mecca of hipness.</p><p>\"When he got to New York, he just expanded and grew,\" said Ruperto Enriquez, who immigrated with his wife to the U.S. from Chiautla de Tapia, Puebla, Mexico, in 1971.</p><p>But the city turned on his son. \"He came back, and it cost him his life,\" the elder Mr. Enriquez said.</p><p>There were about 950 criminal offenses reported on New York's transit system through May this year, roughly equivalent to the same period of 2019, according to a New York Police Department spokesperson. Subway ridership in late May was about 40% lower than prepandemic levels, according to data from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p><p>Mourners from varied walks of life attended a memorial service for Mr. Enriquez last week. Relatives in head-to-toe black with crucifix pendants sat beside financial types in slacks and button-down shirts and bearded hipsters with tattooed arms and carefully uncoiffed hair.</p><p>\"Dan made friends with all different kinds of people,\" said Cara Bowler, a friend of Mr. Enriquez for over two decades. \"He was jovial and fun and lighthearted and life-loving.\"</p><p>When the Enriquez family left Williamsburg in 1980, Ruperto and Eustacia took a young Daniel and his three little sisters to a ranch home in Santa Ana, Calif. The elder Mr. Enriquez worked as a tool and die maker, and another son was born. Daniel devoured books, often reading while walking with his hand on a sister's shoulder to avoid bumping into passersby, his father said.</p><p>Rising crime pushed the family out again in 1990, said Griselda Vile, Mr. Enriquez's middle sister. \"There were gangs and kids getting abducted, girls getting pregnant—our house got robbed three times,\" she said.</p><p>They relocated to a relatively affluent neighborhood on the east side of Seattle with schools that could give the children an on-ramp to the middle class. Mr. Enriquez earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy in Washington, then enrolled in a master's program in Latin American studies at New York University.</p><p>He succeeded academically while diving into the downtown Manhattan art scene, witnessing the birth of the poetry-slam movement at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and reading for hours at the Strand bookstore, said Matteo Cafiso, a friend from Mr. Enriquez's NYU days. A summer trip to Mexico researching his family roots started a lifelong interest in genealogy.</p><p>\"Amongst immigrants there's a striver mentality—you strive for self-improvement,\" said Mr. Cafiso, a first-generation Sicilian-American. \"He understood that what was cool wasn't hanging out getting stoned in the dorm.\"</p><p>After NYU, Mr. Enriquez got a job assisting commodities analysts at Morgan Stanley in the investment bank's equity research department. He found a group of friends at The Abbey, a Williamsburg bar where he could often be found running the pool table, bar-stool philosophizing and generally roistering, said Mark Quinlan, the establishment's former manager.</p><p>Often gregarious in public, Mr. Enriquez showed a compassionate side with those close to him, Ms. Bowler and Mr. Cafiso said. In a letter Mr. Enriquez wrote to Mr. Cafiso from Mexico in 1997, he told his friend, \"How do I know that you're able to be happy? Because you're able to make others happy.\"</p><p>Mr. Enriquez grew more adept at genealogy and came up with a signature trick. He would map out the family trees of friends and colleagues, often going back centuries, then surprise them with the results in a sealed envelope.</p><p>All the while, Mr. Enriquez remained in close touch with his family in Washington, calling his mother often and hosting his siblings and parents on visits to New York. He coached his younger siblings with college applications. His youngest sister, Carolina Swan, was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study in Germany, said his sister Ruth Enriquez de Tiburcio, who works in Washington as a business analyst for an international insurer.</p><p>Mr. Enriquez helped pay for trips to Europe and Mexico and to situate siblings in New York when they decided to follow him there. Ms. Vile became a teacher in New York public schools. Santos Enriquez, the younger brother, became an art director for advertising agencies.</p><p>Mr. Enriquez moved in with longtime partner Adam Pollack at a Park Slope, Brooklyn, apartment, where Mr. Pollack handled the cooking and Mr. Enriquez tended the garden, Ms. Bowler said.</p><p>In 2013, Goldman recruited Mr. Enriquez to work in its global investment research group, where he coordinated report publication, client meetings and marketing events. He combined low-key professionalism and playfulness, organizing birthday celebrations for colleagues and in recent years sporting an ostentatious mustache, co-workers said.</p><p>During the pandemic, Mr. Enriquez studied the Portuguese language and Brazilian guitar through online lessons.</p><p>\"Daniel was very educated, always a lot of fun and spontaneous,\" said Felipe Resende, an Uberlândia, Brazil-based guitar teacher who bonded with Mr. Enriquez over sertanejo, a type of Brazilian folk music.</p><p>\"I was planning to visit him in New York in September,\" Mr. Resende said. \"He was going to show me the city.\"</p><p>Write to Matt Wirz at matthieu.wirz@wsj.com</p><p>Daniel Enriquez Thrived Through a Changing New York.
