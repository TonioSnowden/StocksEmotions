  "text": "<p>   Energy costs especially are busting household budgets. The energy commodities category jumped 48% in March from a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday. Overall inflation rose 8.5%, the highest reading since December 1981. Global food prices jumped to an all-time high in March, according to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. </p><p>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economists estimate that the rise in commodity prices over the past year accounted for 1.9% of U.S. consumer spending, compared with a 1.8% slice when they vaulted ahead of the 2008 crash and 1.2% when the Gulf War doubled oil prices and drove the economy into the short-lived 1990-91 recession. Soaring commodity prices during the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s took a bigger bite out of American budgets. </p><p>   While strong wage growth could help consumers keep up with rising costs, Goldman's economists nonetheless expect commodity prices to limit economic growth this year. </p><p>   Central bankers are responding by raising interest rates. Last month Fed officials approved their first interest-rate increase in more than three years, lifting their benchmark rate to a range between 0.25% and 0.5% and penciling in additional hikes this year. </p><p>   Investors have fled risky investments and piled into those they expect to follow commodity prices higher and offset the erosive effect of inflation elsewhere in their portfolios. </p><p>   Higher rates introduce opportunity cost and reduce the appeal of speculative investments, such as technology stocks, which have halted years of outperformance to lead a 15% decline in the Nasdaq Composite this year. </p><p>   In the S&amp;P 500 index, the top 21 performing stocks this year belong to companies involved in the production of energy, fertilizer or other commodities. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Joe Wallace contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
