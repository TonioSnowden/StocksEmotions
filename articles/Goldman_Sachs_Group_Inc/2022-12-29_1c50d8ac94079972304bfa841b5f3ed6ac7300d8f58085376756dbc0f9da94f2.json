  "title": "Goldman Sachs CEO expects layoffs in first half of January: report",
  "text": "<p>Solomon said the company faces a variety of challenges, including \"tightening monetary conditions\" that are causing an economic slowdown, Bloomberg reported, and \"the focus is on preparing the firm to weather these headwinds.\"</p><p>Earlier this month, there were reports that the investment-banking giant was planning to lay off about 8% of its workforce, or nearly 4,000 employees. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that the number of upcoming layoffs has not been settled, and it may be fewer than that figure.</p><p>Goldman reintroduced performance reviews in 2022, after suspending them during the pandemic. In pre-pandemic times, about 2% to 5% of its lowest-performing employees would be laid off every year.</p><p>Goldman employed about 49,000 people as of the end of its third quarter, and executives have noted its workforce has grown by 34% since Solomon took over as CEO in 2018, about twice the pace of its main competitors.</p><p>Last week, the New York Post reported about internal grumblings at Goldman toward Solomon from middle- and upper-management, leading to speculation that his job could also be at risk.</p><p>In October, Goldman reported its third-quarter net income fell about 44% from the previous year and revenue dropped to $11.98 billion from $13.61 billion a year ago. Still, Goldman is on track to post its second-best annual revenue ever, about $48 billion. The bank also said it would slow the pace of its hiring and reorganize into three business units: Asset &amp; Wealth Management, Global Banking &amp; Markets and Platform Solutions.</p><p>Goldman shares have rallied more than 13% over the past three months, but are still down about 11% year to date, compared to the S&amp;P 500's SPX 2% gain and 21% decline over those periods, respectively.</p><p>Goldman Sachs CEO expects layoffs in first half of January: report</p>",
