Get in touch with us anytime:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:Due.Diligence@ft.com\">Due.Diligence@ft.com</a><strong>.</strong></p> <h2>Toshiba: the activist, the CEO under pressure and CVC's $20bn bid</h2> <p>On the surface, the private equity group <strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong>' <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/20004088-8007-4715-9199-45f681ae307b\">$20bn offer</a> for <strong>Toshiba</strong> is interesting in its own right.&#xa0;</p> <p>If the deal came off, it would be Japan's biggest-ever leveraged buyout and among the 20 top buyouts in history by transaction value.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's particularly sensitive because Toshiba operates Japan's nuclear plants. (Kudos to <strong>Nikkei</strong> which broke the story <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-deals/Toshiba-receives-offer-from-CVC-to-go-private-in-20bn-deal\">here</a>.)&#xa0;</p> <p>But what's really fascinating, and critical to understanding the offer, is the back story.</p> <p><strong>Nobuaki Kurumatani</strong>, Toshiba's chief executive, was the head of CVC's Japan operations until 2018, when the industrial conglomerate best known for consumer electronics hired him as the first outsider to lead it in half a century.&#xa0;</p> <p>As regular DD readers will know, he's been under pressure lately, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9338cd4-84db-4e17-9c5e-ea933413cac7\">particularly</a> from <strong>Effissimo</strong>, a Singapore-based activist fund that owns 9.9 per cent of Toshiba. Kurumatani suffered a humiliating defeat in a showdown at last month's extraordinary general meeting.&#xa0;</p> <p>So a deal that would draw attention away from the battle would be opportune for Kurumatani, the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aaea0bb4-d39c-42f7-95c0-c9270baf2b0b\">Lex</a> column observes.</p> <p>Still, the idea of a CVC take-private is surprising. Toshiba has fought hard, with backing from the Japanese government, to keep its shares listed even as it went through a profit-padding scandal in 2015 and was brought to the verge of bankruptcy two years later.&#xa0;</p> <p>CVC doesn't usually do this type of deal. Its entire Asian fund is worth less than a quarter of the Toshiba deal's price tag, at $4.3bn, and typically buys companies worth $250m to $1.5bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>It has a far larger €21bn fund for deals in Europe and the Americas, which usually takes over companies worth €500m to €5bn and above, and could potentially be part of a deal since Toshiba has operations worldwide.&#xa0;</p> <p>In any case, CVC would likely need other backers to get a deal done. That could include rival private equity firms, investors such as pension funds and of course debt. Partnering with a Japanese government-backed fund or a friendly domestic investor could also be an option.</p> <p>Constructing such a consortium could be tricky. And with a nuclear business in Japan, an investment by a foreign fund would require government approval. Meanwhile, some investors are already complaining that a $20bn-plus bid would be too low. Catch up on the story by DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Kana Inagaki and Leo Lewis <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/20004088-8007-4715-9199-45f681ae307b\">here</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Nonetheless, it's easy to see the attractions for a private equity buyer such as CVC, or <strong>KKR</strong>, which has also looked at the Japanese company. Toshiba has long traded below the sum of its parts and has a 40 per cent stake in the chipmaker <strong>Kioxia</strong>, which in full could be valued at more than $36bn in its expected listing.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Citadel: the hedge fund comeback kid</h2> <p>On Wednesday we <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1333420f-ab58-4a85-b7c6-b7cd5562be8e\">recounted</a> the hedge fund billionaire <strong>Ken Griffin</strong>'s treasure trove of global real estate, from his $238m New York City <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e68c910-1f51-11e9-b126-46fc3ad87c65\">pad</a>, to his luxe home on Miami's Star Island.&#xa0;</p> <p>DD readers will probably know that Griffin built his fortune, which is estimated at about $16bn by Forbes, from two highly lucrative businesses — his hedge fund<strong> Citadel </strong>and the market maker<strong> Citadel Securities</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Both were embroiled in the <strong>GameStop</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/3c1fa744-9de0-4398-a6cc-16e430d8a8dd\">drama</a> at the start of the year. But the widespread public criticism and scathing remarks from regulators have done nothing to dampen Griffin's enthusiasm.&#xa0;</p> <p>As his hedge fund celebrates its 30-year anniversary, Griffin takes pride in how it handled a pandemic that saw dramatic shifts in markets and wrongfooted some of the industry's biggest players.&#xa0;</p> <p>“We fired on all cylinders,” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25e6100d-4cdd-45d0-aaab-6f9b77b14257\">he said in an interview with the FT</a>, recalling how one of his investors recently compared the firm to an F-22 fighter jet. “A lot of other firms are fighting in a biplane, and in moments of turbulence they've got to retreat to safer ground,” he added.</p> <p>But Citadel has by and large left its troubles from 2008, when the firm was on the brink of collapse, behind.&#xa0;</p> <p>So how did Citadel come back from the brink? Insiders and outsiders say there were three factors: its adaptability, heavy investments in technology and Griffin's exacting demands from his traders.</p> <p>Citadel is known for its revolving doors. If you're underperforming, you're out. “There's not a lot of empathy,” one former employee told the FT, while another described it as “capitalism in its purest form”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Aside from attracting the top talent on Wall Street, Citadel has also become a go-to firm for policymakers and regulators.&#xa0;</p> <p>Treasury secretary <strong>Janet Yellen </strong>was paid almost $800,000 by Citadel to give the firm a series of speeches after stepping down as Federal Reserve chair in 2018, and the fund retains former Fed chief <strong>Ben Bernanke </strong>as an adviser. Several former senior US regulatory officials have also joined Citadel Securities.&#xa0;</p> <p>This has left some people feeling uneasy about Griffin's influence beyond Wall Street.&#xa0;</p> <h2>HSBC's French faux pas</h2> <p>When asked how he felt about his bank, <strong>HSBC France</strong>, selling its retail operations to one of private equity groups <strong>Cerberus</strong> or <strong>AnaCap</strong>, the head of a French union <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6522cdb2-7a64-4574-a395-707995c7cb8a\">said</a> he was “caught between the plague and cholera”.</p> <p>Across town, an investment banker called HSBC a “fallen angel” while one former senior employee lamented the sale as bringing “tears to my eyes”, according to the FT's David Keohane in Paris.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The competition driving all that drama is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c877b8f8-22ef-49c9-9daf-e4b3b4e6c8ca\">likely to be won by Cerberus</a> and could see HSBC fork over €500m to the PE group. It will essentially pay Cerberus to take 230 bank branches off its hands, and do some overdue investment in IT and restructuring, as HSBC pivots to Asia.&#xa0;</p> <p>Somewhat uncomfortably, HSBC coughed up €11.1bn when buying into France in 2000, snapping up <strong>Crédit Commercial de France </strong>at a 3.5 times price-to-book ratio.</p> <p>It's easy to blame under-investment for the drop in value or to point out that HSBC has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5c66976-e6d4-11dc-b5c3-0000779fd2ac\">flogged off</a> bits of the bank it bought and received €7.1bn in dividends.</p> <p>But the biggest change might simply be that interest rates have cratered, making a tough French retail banking environment even tougher. Today, <strong>Société Générale</strong> clocks in at a 0.3 price-to-book ratio and <strong>BNP Paribas</strong> at 0.6.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Cerberus, named after the multi-headed dog guarding the gates of Hades, is getting something of a free option while it bets on interest rates rising.&#xa0;</p> <p>Of course, it still has to get the deal over the line. Unions fear that Cerberus will look to cut out costs before flogging a restructured bank to a French rival spared the dirty work. So far, those unions haven't made too much noise but they are warning that will change.&#xa0;</p> <p>But if Cerberus has timed this right then it could be calling the bottom on European retail banking. If not, that idea of a free option will be tested.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Houlihan Lokey </strong>has hired <strong>RBC Capital Markets</strong> alum <strong>Paul Tomasic </strong>as a managing director and head of European healthcare based in London.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Abernathy MacGregor</strong> has added <strong>Matt Reid </strong>as a managing director and head of its Los Angeles office.
