  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Indonesia Bucks Year's Global Selloff",
  "text": "<p>Meanwhile, flows from foreign institutional investors into equities in the Southeast Asian nation reached $5 billion in January through April, according to Goldman Sachs. That is nearly double 2021's full-year total and contrasts with outflows across emerging Asia of $47.8 billion.</p><p>Global stocks and bonds have been besieged this year by a series of challenges, including the Russia-Ukraine war, rapid inflation, strict lockdowns in China, and a shift to tighter monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and other central banks.</p><p>Emerging markets that have outperformed have tended to have significant exposure to commodities and banks, said Herald van der Linde, head of Asia equity strategy at HSBC. \"Indonesia's got both of them,\" he said.</p><p>Indonesia is the world's largest coal exporter and a producer of other key commodities such as oil, gas, nickel and palm oil. It has benefited from rising commodity prices, and investors have bid up stocks in mining and materials companies.</p><p>Shares in the coal miner PT Adaro Energy Tbk, for example, have risen nearly 50% this year. The company's PT Adaro Minerals Indonesia Tbk subsidiary has surged since it went public in January, and its shares are now worth 27 times as much as their initial public offering price. Adaro Minerals mines and trades coking coal, which is used for making iron and steel. Indonesian markets will reopen Monday after being closed for holidays from April 29 onward.</p><p>Indonesia and other Southeast Asian markets such as Malaysia are benefiting from \"a number of factors that include reopening-related optimism in the region as well as support from a deepening base of domestic investors in each country,\" said Vijay Vaidyanathan, head of global capital markets for Southeast Asia at Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Mr. Vaidyanathan added that these indexes were more weighted toward value stocks -- or shares that trade at modest valuations compared with measures such as earnings or book value -- rather than growth stocks.</p><p>Indonesian bank stocks have also risen. These make up a large part of the MSCI index and local equivalents such as Jakarta's IDX Composite Index.</p><p>Shares in PT Bank Central Asia Tbk, Indonesia's biggest company by market value, have gained 11% this year, while stock in the state-backed microfinance lender PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk is up 18%.</p><p>Investors expect higher interest rates will allow banks to charge more on loans, and are anticipating economic recovery as Indonesia loosens Covid-19 restrictions, said Mr. van der Linde at HSBC. \"As the economy picks up, banks will be able to do more business,\" he said.</p><p>The Asian Development Bank forecasts Indonesia's gross domestic product will grow 5% this year, up from a 3.7% increase in GDP last year. Indonesia's central bank hasn't begun to lift policy rates but market-based interest rates have risen, with one-year government bond yields rising from less than 3.7% at the end of last year to nearly 4.4%, Refinitiv data shows.</p><p>Indonesia has been spared some of the problems facing China or its more tourism-dependent neighbors in Southeast Asia such as Thailand, which before the pandemic would attract visitors from China, said Kiran Nandra-Koehrer, head of emerging-equities management at Pictet Asset Management. \"It's been a good place to be,\" Ms. Nandra-Koehrer said.</p><p>Chinese stocks have sold off sharply this year, with the government locking down many major cities as part of its zero-Covid policy.</p><p>While Indonesia is a tourist destination thanks to locales such as the vacation island of Bali, international travel is less important to the overall economy than in Thailand, which has lost out on many prospective tourists from either Russia or China. The country's 270 million strong population offers companies a big domestic consumer market to tap.</p>",
