  "title": "Trial for Former Goldman Sachs Banker Set to Begin; Roger Ng is the first defendant in the 1MDB case to face a U.S. jury",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Ng and Malaysian financier Jho Low were charged in 2018 with conspiring to violate the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and conspiring to launder money that was misappropriated from 1MDB.</p><p>In court papers, Mr. Ng's lawyers have pinned the blame on his boss, former Goldman Sachs partner Timothy Leissner, who previously pleaded guiltyto U.S. charges of conspiracy to launder money and violate antibribery laws. Mr. Leissner lied to high-level Goldman executives about Mr. Ng's involvement in bond deals, Mr. Ng's lawyers have said.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What impact will this trial have on Goldman Sachs? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Mr. Low hasn't been arrested and his whereabouts is unknown. However, in 2019 he agreed to forfeit more than $700 million in assets U.S. authorities had sought to seize.</p><p>Mr. Leissner, who has been cooperating with prosecutors, is expected to be a government witness at the trial.</p><p>Lawyers for Messrs. Ng, Leissner and Low didn't respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment.</p><p>Between 2009 and 2014, the laundered money was used to pay bribes to high-level government officials to obtain business for Goldman, Brooklyn federal prosecutors say. During that time, the bank helped raise about $6.5 billion for 1MDB through three bond offerings and earned $600 million in fees and revenue.</p><p>The scandal chastened the bank. It paid more than $5 billion in penalties to the U.S. and Malaysia and took away compensation from some top executives. It also admitted that a subsidiary broke U.S. corruption laws. Its board called the matter an \"institutional failure.\"</p><p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who was accused of embezzling more than $680 million from the 1MDB fund, was sentenced in 2020 to 12 years imprisonment after a court in his country found him guilty of abuse of power.</p><p>Mr. Low is accused of masterminding the plundering of the fund and acting as an intermediary between Goldman employees and government officials. He and others used the stolen money to buy luxury real estate and artwork and bankroll major Hollywood films, according to federal prosecutors.</p><p>Mr. Ng, a Malaysian national, has been under home detention in New York while awaiting trial. His lawyers have said in court filings that he warned members of Goldman's legal, compliance and investment divisions about Mr. Low, but the bank continued to deal with him.</p><p>Prosecutors, however, said Messrs. Ng and Low had a close relationship in the run-up to the bond offerings. Mr. Ng flew with Mr. Low on private jets, attended a lavish party with him in Las Vegas and met him on a yacht in the Mediterranean Sea during the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, prosecutors said.</p><p>Bill McMurry, the CEO of investigative firm W1 Global and a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who supervised the 1MDB investigation, said 1MDB was one of the biggest international corruption cases that the FBI ever handled.</p><p>The case highlighted the tension between business and compliance officials, Mr. McMurry said. Prosecutors said Goldman compliance teams rejected Mr. Low's attempts to open an account with the bank, citing concerns about his source of income. However, high-level employees in Goldman's investment bank either ignored or nominally addressed red flags raised during the vetting of the bond deals, prosecutors said.</p><p>\"This deal clearly had risks, and Goldman Sachs senior leadership decided to move forward with it,\" Mr. McMurry said. \"They paid a hefty fine for that decision.\"</p><p>Write to James Fanelli at james.fanelli@wsj.com</p><p>Trial for Former Goldman Sachs Banker Set to Begin</p>",
