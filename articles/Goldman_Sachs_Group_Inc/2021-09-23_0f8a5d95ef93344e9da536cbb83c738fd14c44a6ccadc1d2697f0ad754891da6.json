  "text": "<p>By the time Sebastian and Nina connected at a costume party some years later, things were quite a bit different. Before Sebastian graduated from school in 2007, he and two school chums founded a company now called Klarna, which lets users stretch out paying for things they buy over a period of weeks without interest. They call this BNPL in the jargon of fintech, the melding of finance and computer technology. It stands for buy now, pay later, and Klarna is its Scandinavian poster child.</p><p>Klarna currently claims 90 million users and 250,000 participating merchants in 21 countries. People who use it in the U.S., Klarna's fastest-growing market, can pay nothing up front and the full balance in 30 days with free returns in the interim, or pay in four installments spread over six weeks. Klarna is testing out various plans across markets. The company makes the majority of its annual revenue of roughly $1 billion from merchants, who are charged a small fee and pay commissions up to 5.4 percent, with other revenue coming in through a mix of banking, card interchange and affiliate revenue.</p><p>Instant gratification is not something financial regulators are inclined to applaud, however, and some of them look sideways at the very idea of buy now, pay later. The market feels otherwise. A funding round this past June boosted Klarna's valuation to $45.6 billion, making it the world's second-largest private fintech company (the Irish-American firm Stripe is the largest). Sebastian, who turns 40 in October, owns just under 10 percent of it.</p><p>Sebastian and Nina's date went pretty well. By 2012 they were living together in a Stockholm apartment and looking for a place in the country—in Stockholm, the country starts surprisingly close to your doorstep. As fate would have it, the house with the turret went on the market—the old woman was 96. \"It was a sign. We had no plans to move into a house, we had no kids, and it was the worst timing,\" says Nina. \"But we said if we didn't buy the house now, it was never going to come up again in our lifetime.\"</p><p>The two of them were sitting out in the garden of this very house on a warm midsummer afternoon. You can see how a child might find it wreathed in a magical mist. The house sits well back from the road—my taxi passed it by once or twice before we figured out where it was—and the surrounding greenery makes Stockholm feel a lot farther than 15 minutes away. The only way to tell the city is even there is to climb up to a cozy lookout atop the tower. From there you can see clear across the city to the giant white globe of the Avicii Arena.</p><p>Still, it is easy to overlook how laborious even a labor of love can be. This one was. \"It was a long, intense project. There was a lot of hard work. A project like this doesn't come up all the time, but when it does, you need to step up,\" says Daniel Östman, the interior designer, who has also worked with Acne Studios' executive chairman Mikael Schiller and creative director Jonny Johansson.</p><p>All told, it took a good six years before Nina and Sebastian could move in. For starters, the old house needed to be shored up. It was built in 1898, and decades of neglect had turned it into a wreck. \"The tower was actually shaking,\" says Nina. \"Everybody said we should just tear the old house down because it was in such poor shape, but because of my relationship to it we were like, 'Absolutely not!' \"</p><p>New space was needed too. The Siemiatkowskis chose not to reach back to the faded style of another century. An added wing is stripped down and almost disappears under its green roof, which, on this afternoon, was alive with wildflowers and contented bees. That's exactly how they wanted it (sadly, the five-star beehive Nina built has attracted no tenants).</p><p>The couple's three young children now roam the neighborhood the way Nina did as a young girl—though perhaps not quite so freely. Emilia de Poret, a fashion entrepreneur and a friend of theirs, met Nina and Sebastian through her own two children. \"It's an easy, open house. I remember climbing up to the tower on ladders when we first saw the plans. Nina wasn't trained as an architect, but she got so involved with every single detail, and Sebastian trusted her completely. The house is really their love story,\" says de Poret. \"There's so much of both of them in it.\"</p><p>There's a 1977 Irving Penn photo called Frozen Foods on the dining room wall. Penn took the packaging off frozen fruits and vegetables and composed an artful sculpture from the colorful blocks.</p><p>\"When I was 14 or 15, my father took me to Penn's exhibition in Stockholm, and I became obsessed with that photograph. That's when I started photographing. Then Sebastian bought it for me a few years ago,\" says Nina.</p><p>\"We're basically walking inside Nina's head,\" says Sebastian as he shows me around.</p><p>For Sebastian, the house is also about sinking roots, but unlike Nina's, they're roots he never had. Sebastian's parents fled communist Poland for Sweden in 1980, but their new life was bitter. They had left a baby daughter behind in Poland, and they labored painfully to get her out. They arrived as well-educated academics but their careers hit a brick wall in their new homeland. Sebastian's mother had debilitating back problems that forced her to retire early (she is now a painter and a sculptor). His father drove a cab in the university town of Uppsala. Money was scarce, and meals often meant pancakes. \"As a kid I thought that was amazing, but now I realize it's because we had nothing at home but flour, eggs and milk,\" says Sebastian.</p><p>Worse than no money, however, was no respect. \"My father had all these ideas. He wanted to improve the places where he worked, and nobody cared….When you feel you are being underutilized, that creates a lot of depression and sadness.\" Early on, Sebastian imagined that money could help him shore up his parents' broken lives. He learned that the past is beyond repair. \"Unfortunately, you realize life doesn't work that way. My father was struggling with alcoholism, and money doesn't solve the problems he would have wished. Life is more complex than that.\"</p><p>The spark for what turned into Klarna came to Sebastian after his year off from business school in 2003. He was pitching factoring and accounts-receivable products to businesses. Among his clients were e-commerce companies that complained about collecting payments from customers. It showed Sebastian that e-commerce merchants badly needed help managing their payment flows. Klarna could provide that support, which is a big part of its appeal to the merchants who supply its revenue today. Back in school, Sebastian and two friends, Niklas Adalberth and Victor Jacobsson, hammered out the details, and the company that would become Klarna took flight in 2005.</p><p>At the time, hardly any Swedish business students dreamed of founding a company. Staking everything on a startup had not yet acquired its romantic allure. First choice for graduates was a safe berth in finance. \"We were worried. What if it fails? How's that going to look on our CVs?\" Sebastian recalls. \"So we said, 'Let's just do it for six months.' After six months, we said, 'This seems to be working, let's do it another six months.' And here we are, 16 years later.\" (Adalberth and Jacobsson are still shareholders, and Jacobsson has a representative on Klarna's board.)</p><p>\"Sebastian really wanted to prove he could do something big,\" says Niklas Zennström, the co-founder of Skype and an early investor in Klarna via his venture capital fund Atomico. \"You could tell he's going to do anything to win. Back in business school, he pitched Klarna to the elite of Swedish industry and they all rejected him. That just motivated him, and now he's got a bigger market cap than all of them.\"</p><p>It becomes clear how highly Sebastian values single-mindedness as he points out the huge, bowed-out fireplace that dominates the living room. What he loves as much as the way it looks, he explains, is the fierce conviction of the man who made it. \"The guy would come alone on weekends when nobody was here and listen to music and work,\" Sebastian says. \"It was just amazing to see him put his whole body into carving this thing out. I don't much care what people do as long as there is passion involved in doing it.\"</p><p>Sebastian's company made money from the outset, but growth was slow and halting. In 2009, when the company was called Kreditor, he asked the employees to vote on a new name. The employees chose the name Klarna, which means \"clear\" in Swedish. The new name was intended to set Klarna apart from bank credit cards, with their fine print and hidden charges. It helped, but not enough. Sebastian worried that Klarna's underlying message was still muddled.</p><p>Marketing had been Nina's specialty at business school, and she spent five years as head of marketing for one of Sweden's largest public companies, Swedish Match, a smokeless tobacco company. In 2015, Sebastian turned to Nina for help at Klarna. \"I said to Sebastian, 'You have a brand whether you like it or not,' \" says Nina. \"Either you shape it or it becomes something you can't control.\"</p><p>At the time, Nina had her hands full. The couple had begun expanding their family, and Nina was thinking about the house, eventually drawing and redrawing blueprints with their architect, Tomas Lauri. She had also started taking photographs again, traveling back and forth to Kenya to document the daily life of a pride of lions (Sebastian and Nina got married there in 2014). Nina turned this project into The Book of Leon and, with sales of photographic prints, was able to donate $200,000 to lion conservation.</p><p>Finding the right NGOs to support turned into a headache of its own. \"I'm living with this techie and looking at the charity space, and I realize, it's so not digitized,\" says Nina. \"You don't have any tools to connect donors to the people doing the actual work.\" So Nina created Milkywire, a membership platform and app that she describes as a kind of Patreon for philanthropy, connecting private and corporate donors directly to local grass-roots projects and experts in the field. Milkywire is currently up and running with a staff of close to 40 and features organizations in 30 countries.</p><p>Sebastian: \"Eventually, I was just like, 'OK, can you just jump in and help me do our first TV ad?' \"</p><p>Nina: \"I said, 'That's literally the worst idea I have ever heard.' \"</p><p>Sebastian: \"You can imagine people's reaction— 'OK, now he's bringing in his wife!' I don't think it was very well received. But you came in and pulled in some amazing people. We started talking about how we could change this antiquated banking world of middle-aged white men in suits.\"</p><p>Exit the men in suits. The new marketing team Nina helped assemble gave Klarna a millennial-friendly new identity and a wacky TV commercial with a trout sliding across a floor. \"That was smoooth,\" runs the tagline, highlighting the word that Klarna wants everybody to associate with its frictionless financial services. Snoop Dogg and A$AP Rocky are Klarna pitchmen and investors.</p><p>For now, Germany is Klarna's largest market, but the U.S. has been adding a million Klarna users a month and will soon overtake it. \"It's hard for a non-U.S. company to crack the U.S. market,\" says Zennström. \"Sebastian made some wrong choices at the beginning, but he learns from his mistakes all the time. He's a fighter.\"</p><p>Klarna faces formidable new competitors. In August, San Francisco–based flexible-payment company Affirm struck a deal with Amazon, while Jack Dorsey's Square offered $29 billion for Australia's Afterpay BNPL platform. Just weeks before, Bloomberg reported that Apple would join Goldman Sachs to explore a joint BNPL venture. Regulators, meanwhile, worry that Klarna and its ilk may be just a little too breezy. In February, the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority published a review recommending regulation of BNPL. The review also expressed concern over whether customers understand that BNPL is a form of credit and that the services are used by retailers to drive sales while risking that buyers cannot actually afford the products.</p><p>Klarna's real-time algorithms are smart enough to stem heedless spending, says Sebastian. Moreover, the algorithms get smarter as customers rack up more purchases, like playlist suggestions from Klarna's Swedish neighbor Spotify. Only .4 to .5 percent of Klarna's 90 million users worldwide reach the point where Klarna has to twist arms to get its money back—far lower than the credit card industry, according to Klarna's numbers.</p><p>\"You could also blame the people building roads to the shopping mall,\" says Sebastian. \"If you think credit shouldn't exist at all, I'm not going to win that debate.\"</p><p>Klarna is looking out beyond BNPL anyway. In a way, BNPL is to Sebastian Siemiatkowski what books were to Jeff Bezos—a foot in the door to a room with no walls. Klarna, which is a fully licensed bank in Europe, has already bundled other services with its deferred-purchase function. It automatically tracks where your package is, measures your order's carbon footprint and manages returns. Future plans include travel booking and virtual shopping services.</p><p>\"You cannot form your business around what you're supposed to do,\" says Sebastian. \"You have to ask yourself, What problems am I especially well-suited to solve for my customers? Now, if someone internally were to come to me and say, 'I think we can do amazing furniture for our customers,' I might say, 'I don't think we should do that.' \"</p><p>However far Klarna's branches spread, the tree has its roots here, in this lovely garden just outside of Stockholm. Shortly after buying the house, Sebastian started delving into its history. He found the original owner in Stockholm's old address directory. He turned out to be a tea merchant.</p><p>The second owner ran Sweden's first fashion magazine, called Charme, in the 1920s (she hand-painted much of the magazine's artwork herself). The magazine gave its readers tips for living a more stylish life, just as such magazines do today, including lists of popular songs they might like. Sebastian had found some old copies and put together a Charme playlist from Spotify. He hit a switch and \"Embraceable You\" came out of the walls. Sebastian also managed to find an old tin box with the tea merchant's brand name on it. He showed it to me proudly, like an heirloom from an ancestor.</p><p>Inside Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski's Striking Home</p>",
