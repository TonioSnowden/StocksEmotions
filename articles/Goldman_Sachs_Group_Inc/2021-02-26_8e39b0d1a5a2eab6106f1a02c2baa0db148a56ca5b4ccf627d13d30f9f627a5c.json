  "text": "<p>The head of Canada's largest pension fund has resigned after he travelled to the Middle East and received the Covid-19 vaccine, sparking a backlash. </p> <p>In a statement, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board said Mark Machin had travelled to the United Arab Emirates in a personal capacity and “arranged to be vaccinated against Covid-19”.</p> <p>Canada has imposed stringent controls on travel, barring most visitors and all but shutting down its border with the US. Many elderly and vulnerable people there are still waiting for the vaccine. </p> <p>But Machin, aged 54, found a faster route to vaccination in the UAE, where observers have noticed an influx of wealthy individuals hoping to take advantage of an emerging grey market in vaccines.</p> <p>His resignation marked a swift exit from the $356bn pension fund that is both a retirement safety net for millions of Canadian workers and a global financial heavyweight, playing a role in large deals.</p> <p>“We are very disappointed by this troubling situation,” a spokesperson for Canada's finance minister Chrystia Freeland said on Friday. “Canadians place their trust in the CPPIB and expect it to be held to a higher standard.”</p> <p>After training as a medical doctor and pursuing an investment banking career at Goldman Sachs, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12ad073c-2a9a-4cb0-8452-ce4e50b216be\">Machin took the top job</a> at CPPIB in 2016, assuming a role that straddles public service and high finance. </p> <p>Most working Canadians are required to contribute to the government-mandated fund. It has become a top client of major asset management firms and a participant in complex deals such as last year's $2.25bn financing of Google's self-driving car venture Waymo.</p> <p>Machin, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment, departed hours after a Wall Street Journal report on his trip triggered outrage in Canada.</p> <p>In the UAE some people have been paying several thousand dollars to get their jab, said people briefed on the matter. Government officials have also been offering vaccines to some non-residents. For example, UAE Team Emirates, the professional cycling team, received a jab in January in Abu Dhabi.</p> <p>Most vaccine tourists have remained anonymous. However, the chief executive of Eni, Claudio Descalzi, and other senior officials at the Italian oil company received a free Pfizer jab in Dubai last month. UAE authorities offered Eni's management the vaccines “for business purposes”, the company said, confirming Italian media reports.</p> <p>At the time&#xa0;in Dubai, the Pfizer&#xa0;vaccine was&#xa0;available&#xa0;only to nationals, frontline workers and&#xa0;residents&#xa0;with chronic conditions or&#xa0;above 60 years of age. In Italy, home to Descalzi, who is in his 60s, the vaccine rollout campaign had just begun with only highly exposed healthcare workers qualifying for the jab.&#xa0;</p> <p>The official UAE vaccination programme is generally available only to residents, who are inoculated free. The UAE has one of the world's highest inoculation rates, behind only Gibraltar, Israel and the Seychelles.</p> <p>CPPIB provided no information on how Machin had obtained his vaccine.</p> <p>The Dubai authorities have been administering the BioNTech/Pfizer and Oxford/AstraZeneca jabs. Far more doses of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine have been provided by Abu Dhabi and federal health authorities across all seven emirates in the UAE.</p> <p>CPPIB paid tribute to Machin's leadership and announced another senior executive, John Graham, as his successor.</p><p>Source: Mark Vandevelde in New York, Laura Noonan in Dublin, Simeon Kerr in Dubai and Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli in Milan 2021 'Head of Canada's largest pension fund quits after Covid vaccine trip' FT.com 26 February.
