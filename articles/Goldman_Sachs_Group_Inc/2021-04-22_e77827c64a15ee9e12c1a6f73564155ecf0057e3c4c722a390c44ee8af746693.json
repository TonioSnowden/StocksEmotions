  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Big Leveraged-Buyout Offers Spring Up as Funds Swell With Cash  ----  By Miriam Gottfried and Ben Dummett",
  "text": "<p>   The mega-LBO is back. Maybe. </p><p>   Leveraged buyout bids measuring in the double-digit billions, a relative rarity since the financial crisis, have been showing signs of a comeback lately. </p><p>   Earlier this month, private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners submitted a proposal worth more than $20 billion for Japan's Toshiba Corp., setting off a potential auction. Meanwhile, Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners and Sweden's EQT AB have teamed up for a bid on Royal KPN NV that could value the Dutch telecommunications company at more than $15 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported. </p><p>   And medical-supply giant Medline Industries Inc. has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to help it explore a sale, likely to one or more private-equity firms, the Journal reported. Such a deal could value the family-owned company at as much as $30 billion. </p><p>   It is far from guaranteed that any of these transactions will be completed -- and, indeed, on Tuesday Toshiba rebuffed the CVC proposal -- but the fact that they are even under consideration is noteworthy. Between 2005 and 2007, private-equity firms inked 18 deals worth $10 billion or more, according to Dealogic. Since then, they have struck only 10, mindful that many of the precrisis deals didn't work out as planned. </p><p>   Now the urge to go big appears to be back, with private-equity firms sitting on a record $1.6 trillion in unspent cash, according to Preqin, and looking for ways to deploy it in a pricey market. Firms with the biggest funds also see larger buyouts as a way to separate themselves from the competition, deal advisers say. </p><p>   Another factor is at play: Buyout firms are increasingly wooing investors by giving them the opportunity to invest directly in target companies and avoid fund fees. The potential for these co-investments means the dry powder private-equity firms are sitting on is even greater than appreciated, said Jonathan Karen, a partner in the funds group at law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP. </p><p>   \"There's this shadow capital,\" he said. \"If you have a $10 billion fund, you might have $5 billion -- or even another $10 billion -- waiting in the wings.\" </p><p>   Many of the deals struck before the financial crisis produced middling returns, and companies such as TXU Corp., later renamed Energy Future Holdings Corp., filed for bankruptcy protection when their debt proved too big a burden after the recession hit. And no one is saying big LBOs are less risky now. </p><p>   The amount of leverage employed in U.S. buyouts is at an elevated level, with the two-year trailing average debt multiple reaching seven times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2020, data from consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. show. That compares with 6.4 times in 2007. Regulators have discouraged banks that make buyout loans from financing deals in which debt is above six times Ebitda. </p><p>   Meanwhile, the two-year trailing average purchase-price multiple reached a record 12.8 times Ebitda in 2020, compared with 9.4 times in 2007. </p><p>   Still, bankers and other deal advisers say there are important differences between now and then, not least of which is rock-bottom interest rates, which make it much cheaper for buyout targets to borrow. Increased use of \"covenant-lite\" loans, which come with few lender protections, means borrowers also have more room to breathe in the event of an economic downturn. </p><p>   Before the financial crisis, firms also relied heavily on financial engineering, or rejiggering a company's balance sheet rather than its operations, to juice returns. Now, they are more likely to have a view on how to improve a company's operations. </p><p></p>",
