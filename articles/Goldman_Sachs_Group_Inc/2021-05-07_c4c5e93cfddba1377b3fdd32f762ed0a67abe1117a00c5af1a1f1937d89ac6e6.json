  "text": "<p>Managing flotations is more art than science, according to investment bankers. Like a soufflé or a watercolour, the right ingredients can easily produce the wrong results. The harshest critics of Deliveroo, the UK food delivery group, would argue its chaotic initial public offering did not even boast good constituents. </p> <p>UK cyber-security group Darktrace erred in the other direction, seeming to underprice its stock last week. The sharp share price rise has made investors feel more confident. That effort was bolstered further by Jefferies on Thursday when the deal's underwriter exercised overallotment<a href=\"https://ir.darktrace.com/regulatory-news\"> options in full</a>.</p> <p>Confirmed net IPO proceeds for Darktrace reached the full £153m. In its role as stabilisation manager, Jefferies has 30 days in which to use a “greenshoe” mechanism to prop up shares if they fall below the IPO price. Shares in Darktrace rose a further 9 per cent on Thursday suggesting that this prospect has become a more distant possibility.</p> <p>Greenshoes feature in most IPOs. They allow underwriters to support the price during a market debut without risking their own capital. An overallotment — usually 15 per cent of the offer — is sold short in a pre-arranged deal with a long-term investor or the selling company itself. If the price falls at the IPO, the manager buys shares in the market, closing the short and supporting the share price. Any profits usually go to the issuer. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf75f260-33d8-42ea-85c3-6482aa1fb2ff\">reportedly bought £75m</a> of Deliveroo shares in its efforts to stem IPO price declines. For Darktrace, Jefferies covered the short using the extra tranche of stock the issuer was holding in reserve.</p> <p>The unpredictable nature of the IPO process means that greenshoes will remain required footwear. Deliveroo is an extreme example. Pre-IPO it claimed oversubscription by prospective buyers. On the day, demand turned out to be far weaker once allocations at the price available were agreed. An industry less attached to tradition would create an online auction system with surer outcomes.</p> <p><em>Our popular newsletter for premium subscribers Best of Lex is published twice weekly.
