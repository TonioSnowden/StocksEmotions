  "text": "<p>Dear reader,</p> <p>We dubbed Kwasi Kwarteng <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d79f40f1-500a-480d-9954-33c177681438\">“Mr Cliff Edge”</a> in Lex earlier this week. It was a reference to the financial chaos likely if the UK chancellor failed to publish a credible funding plan for £45bn of tax cuts he had promised.</p> <p>We thought it was unfair that Andrew Bailey was taking the blame for precipices. True, the Bank of England governor refused to extend purchasing support for chaotic long-end gilts beyond today. But he had intervened in the first place to clear up a mess Kwarteng created.</p> <p>Moreover, we already had a name for Bailey: <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimwaterson/the-tortoise-and-the-shares\">The Sexy Tortoise</a>. This Financial Times coinage, endorsed by Bailey's former boss Mark Carney, referred to an executive style as slow but conclusive as the courtship of the Galápagos Islands' most famous residents.</p> <p>Neither name worked brilliantly this week. The heroes of cliffhanger movies always survive. But Kwarteng is now toast. And only a turtle supplied with amphetamines and a Sandhurst education could defeat an adversary with the tactical élan shown by Bailey.</p> <p>His refusal to extend bond-buying support denied the government wriggle room, precipitating an internal political crisis and a U-turn on tax cuts. When news of the planned volte-face leaked, sterling and gilts rallied, pointing squarely to the culpability of Kwarteng for previous falls.</p> <p>Bailey's stubbornness also forced pension funds to rejig derivatives exposure, rather than lazily bake a BoE backstop into their planning. Meanwhile, he astutely hedged his risk by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4848b650-4e7f-41f9-89c3-5fd7564952e9\">creating a liquidity facility</a> to prop up wobbly pension funds after the bond-buying programme ended today.</p> <p>A surprising number of otherwise reliable business pundits misunderstood the aim of BoE market interventions this week. They are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e53de50-66a1-4181-a107-d3e9a53aa233\">intended to forestall panics</a>. They are not meant to impose an artificial yield ceiling of 5 per cent on 30-year gilts.</p> <p>New chancellor Jeremy Hunt will presumably treat Bailey with more respect than Kwarteng did when he briefed against the “governator”. That should help Bailey, who will remain at the centre of the UK's economic storm. Steep interest rate rises mean mortgage repayments <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52b4357e-5ed3-4f2e-913f-1de3ef4b6e78\">are becoming unaffordable</a> for a significant minority of borrowers.</p> <p>Banks are even more exposed to criticism. They are likely to offer hefty forbearance to distressed borrowers in hopes of forestalling higher windfall taxes. </p> <p>Spain is already introducing these levies. In addition, CaixaBank, the country's biggest lender, has reportedly proposed freezing the cost of the variable-rate mortgages that predominate there. </p> <h1>Quietly flow the deals</h1> <p>We noticed this week that our corporate finance contacts have been taking an uncharacteristically relaxed approach to their time management. </p> <p>There is a dearth of deals. And there are only so many M&amp;A proposals it is worth sending to chief executives freaked out by macro instability.</p> <p>The hiatus <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc23e994-c4f7-40c2-b175-f2e95a32fdbf\">hurts US M&amp;A boutiques</a> including Evercore, Lazard and Moelis more than bulge bracket houses such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The former group lacks the buffer of big trading operations. </p> <p>Top bankers will be tempted to run around firing swaths of underlings. But if they go too far, their businesses will lack capacity when the economy turns up again.</p> <p>Canadian alternatives group Brookfield is big and hairy enough to carry on transacting even in today's unsettled market. Lex was tickled by its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/277b6f6d-be7d-4b8b-9c8e-18b895eca2e7\">sale of nuclear group Westinghouse Electric</a> to uranium processor Cameco and one of its own funds for an enterprise value of $7.9bn. </p> <p>That produced a hefty internal rate of return of 60 per cent. Nuclear power, which was out of fashion when Brookfield bought Westinghouse Electric from the bankruptcy of Toshiba in 2018, is now back in vogue.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3148055-786c-4ddc-aacb-f48f0475574d\">Tokyo flotation of Socionext</a> this week was also cutely timed. The weak yen will boost the chip designer's overseas sales. A shortage of other new floats meant there was plenty of pent-up demand for the stock. The shares jumped when they started trading. </p> <p>But Lex is increasingly bearish on the chip cycle amid signs of an inventory glut for lower-end microprocessors. Higher-end chips are, for their part, subject to new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fdfbf5d2-0d24-46c7-b319-f524a72cff4d\">US curbs on their exportation to China</a>. The ban extends to some chipmaking equipment, setting back China's plans for technological self-sufficiency.</p> <p>Russia is even more friendless in the west. That explains why companies from President Vladimir Putin's pariah state such as gold miner Polymetal are contemplating switching their domicile to Hong Kong. There are already oligarch superyachts moored up in the Fragrant Harbour. </p> <p>Hong Kong valuations are at record lows, so the city's bankers and brokers may be grateful for this foreign interest. Lex warned them against letting Hong Kong become the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ee73dcd-c31e-4a79-a2ed-3752b9ab5d42\">financial centre of last resort</a> for footloose Russians.</p> <h1>Out to grass</h1> <p>“Need any weed, geezer?” That entrepreneurial urban salutation could acquire a double meaning if algae become a popular food source. US start-ups are trying to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5205ef80-7140-4431-a5fe-41bf9ed20016\">commercialise this food source</a>, which is rich in protein.</p> <p>A grassy or fishy taste reputedly deters would-be algae eaters. So it may be some time before a furtive youth in a hoodie approaches you in downtown London or New York offering you contraband spirulina.</p> <p>Legal pot has meanwhile been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d1daf18-7225-48ff-88b8-7e7954b72fa9\">a bad trip for investors</a> in North America. The ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF, which tracks the sector, is down 88 per cent from its euphoric highs of 2018. Hype and the difficulty of scaling up businesses are to blame.</p> <p>Thanks for reading and please email me with any comments or suggestions regarding Lex coverage at <a href=\"mailto:lexfeedback@ft.com\">lexfeedback@ft.com</a>.</p> <p>Enjoy your weekend, whatever you do to relax,</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Guthrie<br></strong><em>Head of Lex</em></p><p>Source: Jonathan Guthrie 2022 'The Lex Newsletter: Kwarteng vs Bailey — how The Sexy Tortoise vanquished Mr Cliff Edge' FT.com 14 October.
