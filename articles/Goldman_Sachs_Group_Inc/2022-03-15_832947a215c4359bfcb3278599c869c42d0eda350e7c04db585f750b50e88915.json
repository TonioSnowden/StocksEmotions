  "text": "<p>Benchmark oil prices on Tuesday fell below $100 a barrel for the first time since March 1 on expectations that lockdowns could slow petroleum demand in China, the world's largest importer of crude. </p> <p>Brent crude, the international oil marker, settled at $99.91, its lowest close since February 25, down 6.5 per cent on the day. West Texas Intermediate, the US crude contract, declined 6.4 per cent to settle at $96.44, its lowest closing price since February 28. </p> <p>Oil prices were at their highest levels since 2008 earlier this month, as Russia's isolation from the international community over its invasion of Ukraine began to limit its exports of crude. </p> <p>That pressure on the oil market has eased slightly in recent days as Covid-19 infections in China have risen to the highest levels since the virus first emerged more than two years ago, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d59c7636-d895-4138-8e07-e9fbfdbd100f\">prompting lockdowns</a> in some the country's main manufacturing hubs. </p> <p>But oil analysts also said that the sell-off could be brief. “The reprieve of cheaper oil may be shortlived,” said Louise Dickson, Rystad Energy's senior oil analyst, “as falling prices indicate the market has not fully realised the potential impact of lost Russian barrels on global supply.”</p> <p>Equity markets in China and Hong Kong posted a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/528f580a-6770-4940-b8f8-670cf409580a\">second day of sharp declines</a> on concerns over the outbreak as well as reports that Beijing had signalled its willingness to provide Russia with military assistance to support its invasion of Ukraine.</p> <p>Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index dropped 5.7 per cent, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises index of large and liquid Chinese stocks shed 6.6 per cent. In China, the CSI 300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen-listed stocks fell 4.6 per cent. </p> <p>Falling oil prices drove US stocks higher on Tuesday even as traders prepared for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates on Wednesday. Economists widely expect the central bank to deliver a quarter-point increase — the first rate rise since 2018 — as the war in Ukraine threatens to exacerbate inflation that is already running at its highest annual rate in 40 years.</p> <p>A report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday showed a 10 per cent annual rise in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dfe654df-4fd3-4f88-9d8c-e8f05c8624dc\">US producer prices</a> in February, setting the stage for the Fed to lift rates. </p> <p>Wall Street's benchmark S&amp;P 500 ended up the day 2.1 per cent higher, with every market sector rising except energy. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which is down 17 per cent year-to-date, added 2.9 per cent. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Europe's regional Stoxx 600 index ended the day down 0.3 per cent. Germany's Dax lost 0.1 per cent and France's Cac 40 index dropped 0.2 per cent. In London, the FTSE 100 closed 0.2 per cent lower.<br><br>Russia's invasion of Ukraine late last month had left Europe&#xa0;“flirting on the edge of recession”, said Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, who added that the fighting would stoke inflation and curb growth.</p> <p>In government debt markets, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose 0.01 percentage points to 2.14 per cent, hovering around its highest level since 2019, which it hit earlier in the day. The yield on Germany's 10-year Bund, which serves as a barometer for eurozone borrowing costs, fell 0.04 percentage points to 0.33 per cent.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Derek Brower in New York, Neil Hume in London and Tabby Kinder in Bangkok</em></p><p>Source: Kate Duguid in New York, George Steer in London and Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong 2022 'Oil falls below $100 a barrel as China lockdowns threaten demand' FT.com 15 March.
