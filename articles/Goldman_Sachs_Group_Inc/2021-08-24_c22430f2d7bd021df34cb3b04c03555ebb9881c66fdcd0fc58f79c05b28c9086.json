  "title": "Business News: Broadband Provider CityFibre Close to Winning Investment",
  "text": "<p>Wholesale broadband network providers such as CityFibre and incumbent telecom operators such as AT&amp;T Inc. in the U.S. and Britain's BT Group PLC are racing to expand their high-speed networks to reach more customers and support the rollout of superfast 5G wireless services.</p><p>At the same time, the promise of recurring revenue generated from the high-speed transmission of video and other bandwidth-hogging data is drawing investors seeking steady long-term returns.</p><p>The deal, if finalized, is expected to be announced over the coming weeks and would valueCityFibre at more than GBP 2 billion, equivalent to $2.7 billion, the people said.</p><p>CityFibre is controlled by an infrastructure arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and European buyout firm Antin Infrastructure Partners, which together acquired the business in 2018 for GBP 537.8 million.</p><p>Based in London, CityFibre is expected to raise more than GBP 500 million from the stake sale to Mubadala and Interogo Holding AG, a Switzerland-based vehicle that invests in infrastructure and other assets to generate returns to help ensure IKEA's independence.</p><p>Mubadala oversees a total of about $243 billion in assets and a bet on CityFibre would be consistent with prior investments in the sector. In 2018, the fund acquired a minority stake in Hyperoptic Ltd., another U.K. broadband provider, for an undisclosed amount. It then sold that holding the next year to U.S. buyout firm KKR &amp; Co.</p><p>CityFibre also plans to issue new debt as part of the deal, the people said, giving the broadband network provider a total of around GBP 1 billion in new money to help fund its network rollout.</p><p>CityFibre's networks are located in more than 60 towns and cities in the U.K., according to its website. Customers include Vodafone Group PLC, which uses the networks to offer high-speed internet service in parts of Britain, and the U.K.'s Three to support its 5G wireless services. Three is owned by Hong Kong-based conglomerate CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd.</p><p>The new funding is expected to support CityFibre's existing plan to invest GBP 4 billion to expand its services to another 216 towns and villages by 2025 as it seeks to cover close to a third of the U.K. market.</p><p>Mubadala and Interogos investment in CityFibre comes amid signs of increasing competition. BT, which also offers wholesale broadband services, said in May it might seek a partner to accelerate its network fiber rollout to reach 25 million premises in the U.K. by 2026, up from a previous target of 20 million.</p>",
