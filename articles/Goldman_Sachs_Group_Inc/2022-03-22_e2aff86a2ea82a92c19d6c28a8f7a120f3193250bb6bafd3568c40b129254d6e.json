  "title": "Why THG needs more change than a City-friendly chair",
  "text": "<p>“Part of my job is taking the bullets,” Lord Charles Allen once<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ce215e0-26b8-11db-81f8-0000779e2340\"> told the Financial Times </a>during his executive career. “But you can only take so many bullets.”</p> <p>Matt Moulding, co-founder, chief executive and until Tuesday, executive chair of the retailer formerly known as The Hut Group, has been taking plenty of metaphorical bullets. Allen, the new independent chair, is going to have to absorb some too.</p> <p>Despite a governance upgrade initiated in October, there is little sign that a fight against a sceptical City is getting easier for THG. Its shares have more than halved since it unveiled plans that would cut back Moulding's formal control of the group. </p> <p>A corporate tidy-up now under way is welcome. Though the company has yet to make the move to a premium stock exchange listing it promised, it insists plans to do so are on track. Moulding's golden share should go when it does. Meanwhile a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c97884f-99fe-4684-a9f6-27198cd314d1\">troublesome share pledge</a> has been unwound and a controversial government loan appears to have been settled. There has been a flurry of internal corporate activity, reorganising company structures and subsidiaries.</p> <p>Allen's appointment is welcome, too. He has executive experience at Granada and ITV, and non-executive positions. That is clearly better than having Moulding both as chair and chief executive of a company whose strategy and execution is under question. </p> <p>But the clubbable Scot's record as chair is not exactly conclusive.</p> <p>Neither Danish-listed ISS, where he stepped down last year, nor FTSE 250 construction group Balfour Beatty has demonstrated spectacular share price performance.</p> <p>THG highlights his “consumer, retail, digital and media expertise”. But, ironically for a man who was once derided as one of the “cost cutting caterers who know nothing about television”, thanks to his background with Granada and Compass Group, Allen's resume of the past three decades is now dominated by the media. On top of Granada, ITV and Global, he filled non-executive roles at Endemol and Virgin Media. His expertise in online retail is less obvious. </p> <p>If THG's problems are ones of public perception rather than operational performance, however, Allen should have relevant skills in abundance. </p> <p>More tellingly, perhaps, THG cites Allen's “experience of working with entrepreneurs”. He chaired the “chicken king” Ranjit Singh Boparan's 2 Sisters Food Group for nine years, through the food safety scandal. He has chaired Ashley Tabor-King's Global media group for 15 years. That suggests Allen is good at getting along with founders. It is less clear that he will serve as a heavy counterweight to Moulding. </p> <p>Ultimately THG needs something more substantial than a governance overhaul to turn round its relationship with investors, as the muted share price reaction to Allen's appointment indicates.</p> <p>The City does not trust that THG's Ingenuity platform has the financially transformative prospects implied by the £4.5bn valuation SoftBank effectively put on the division last year. More than that, though, investors remain cautious on the financial performance of the company's core businesses such as make-up and Myprotein. The company's current valuation has THG trading at an enterprise value to sales ratio of 0.4 times or 4.9 times forward enterprise value to ebitda, according to analysts at Liberum: a “distressed valuation” they insist is “wholly inappropriate for THG”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Someone with substantial online retail experience in the chair might have helped. Beyond that, there are broadly three things that could arrest the decline. </p> <p>One is for SoftBank to do something with its option to invest in Ingenuity other than let it lapse. THG's share price indicates investors do not hold out much hope. </p> <p>The second is some kind of corporate activity. THG still has to update the market on plans to spin off various divisions, which seem a stretch. The quickest way for investors to secure value would be for someone to take it out. Allen has abundant experience with private companies and the buyout sector, from his days as an adviser to Goldman Sachs and as EMI chair after the Terra Firma takeover. The challenge may be whipping into shape not just the group, but Moulding's price expectations. </p> <p>The last is steady, operational improvements, being clear about financial performance and meeting guidance. THG has not found that easy. The likelihood is that until it happens, THG continues to take bullets. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:cat.rutterpooley@ft.com\"><em>cat.rutterpooley@ft.com</em></a><em><br>@catrutterpooley</em></p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2022 'Why THG needs more change than a City-friendly chair' FT.com 22 March.
