  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start</strong>: <strong>Rothesay</strong>, Britain's largest pensions insurance specialist with more than £60bn in assets, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f95f1a0-2352-4650-a684-593f5f31d151\">poised to launch</a> 25- and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages in the UK in an attempt to offer greater certainty for borrowers as the threat of interest rate rises increases.</p> <h1>Overhaul global finance to cut greenhouse emissions </h1> <p><strong>Al Gore</strong>'s 2006 film <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> raised public awareness of the global risks of climate change. Now, the former US vice-president says the finance industry has to wake up to its own inconvenient truth: it needs total reform.</p> <p>Last week, I sat down with the former politician turned climate activist, along with my FT colleagues <em>Attracta Mooney </em>and <em>Patrick Jenkins, </em>and Gore's business partner <strong>David Blood</strong>, the former head of <strong>Goldman Sachs Asset Management</strong>. The pair co-founded <strong>Generation Investment Management</strong>, a specialist sustainable investment house, almost two decades ago.</p> <p>Ahead of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/799b7b93-9ec5-4318-9ac1-1c82cb81f96d\">COP26 in Glasgow</a>, 73-year-old Gore was unequivocal in his diagnosis, saying the world can no longer afford for the finance industry to continue its large-scale backing of carbon-intensive projects and those that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d29231ca-3bdc-4bd1-a477-5504c772259a\">erode biodiversity</a>. (Just last week, the FT published a story about how the global finance industry has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff1eccc8-645a-497b-a02d-6eb38efe6219\">sunk $119bn</a> into companies linked to deforestation in the five years since the Paris accord.)</p> <p>And <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8884d9f-d9d8-4b88-b34b-c59c97408629\">Gore's recommendation</a>? Reform regulatory capital requirements and global accounting standards, and improve&#xa0;disclosure to force banks, traditional asset managers, private equity firms and asset owners to overhaul how they deal with climate change risks. </p> <p>Blood, for his part, weighed in on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/814cbd2c-00db-41b7-91af-28435301a8a2\">investor dilemma</a> as to whether the asset management industry should engage with or divest from companies to achieve climate change goals. The passive giants such as <strong>BlackRock,</strong> <strong>Vanguard </strong>and <strong>State Street Global Advisors </strong>“don't have a choice until you change the index or you decide to get your clients' approval to deviate from the benchmark,” Blood said. “They have to ramp up their engagement efforts quite significantly.”&#xa0;</p> <p>But active managers must vote with their wallets, he added. </p> <blockquote>  <p>“You can have engagement for a while, but unless you have a clear and present commitment to divest, your engagement isn't credible. I don't think you have decades to work with companies, I think you have a couple of years. And if they're not going to actively show you the plan to decarbonise or to enhance their diversity or do different things with their communities, then you're going to have to do something different. That will likely be moving your capital elsewhere.”</p> </blockquote> <h1>A short seller's $1m ‘bounty' on Tether&#xa0; </h1> <p><strong>Hindenburg Research</strong> has brought the tactics of an old-world sheriff to the ‘Wild West' of crypto. The noted short selling firm founded by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15bcb54f-311e-4c54-bc65-bfa3360f0b3f\"><strong>Nathan Anderson</strong></a> has offered a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b62d83d-c5f0-4586-b68c-b6facaba83a4\">$1m “bounty”</a> for exclusive details on the assets behind <strong>Tether</strong>, the $70bn crypto stablecoin, according to my colleagues <em>Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan</em>, <em>Joshua Oliver</em> and <em>Robert Smith</em>. </p> <p>A year ago, stories about stablecoins might not have made big waves. But more recently worries about the risks posed by this type of crypto token are high on the agenda. <strong>Jon Cunliffe</strong>, Bank of England deputy governor for financial stability, <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2021/october/jon-cunliffe-swifts-sibos-2021\">warned in a speech</a> last week that these coins — which are usually linked to the value of traditional assets, most often the US dollar — created a link between financial markets and crypto that could be strained in a crisis.</p> <p>Meanwhile, earlier this year <strong>Fitch Ratings</strong> flagged the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b734b2e8-db37-46fe-93b1-d47a59f74068\">growing systemic risk of stablecoins</a> and US Treasury Secretary <strong>Janet Yellen </strong>said in the summer that the US must “act quickly” to regulate this part of the crypto universe.</p> <p>The attention from top officials raises the stakes in the controversy around Tether, the world's largest stablecoin. Earlier this month, it agreed (without admitting or denying liability) to pay a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7db307c-ef43-4af8-8f14-c1d1ba414058\">$41m penalty</a> to resolve a US regulator's claims that it had falsely represented that its digital tokens were fully backed by dollars in the past. Hot on the heels of this settlement, a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0035016c-29ad-4e6f-9163-2a17df490aa5\">major customer contradicted Tether's bedrock claim</a> that it will issue new stablecoins only in exchange for hard currency.</p> <p>Hindenburg, known for targeting companies such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/168be1c5-5f54-473f-b373-096b8a511ba9\">electric truck start-up</a> <strong>Nikola</strong> and sports betting company <strong>DraftKings</strong>, is now prepared to bet $1m that somebody, somewhere knows something more. </p> <p>Tether slammed the bounty as “a pathetic bid for attention”. Keep your popcorn supplies topped up.</p> <h1>Chart of the week</h1> <p>Investors have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7488b69-db24-4053-bae3-db5930b1fe8f\">pulled $9.4bn</a> out of UK-focused equity funds this year after hopes that a Covid-19 vaccination drive would fuel a vigorous economic recovery were overshadowed by questions about slow growth, supply chain concerns and high inflation — exacerbated by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/brexit\">B-word</a>.
