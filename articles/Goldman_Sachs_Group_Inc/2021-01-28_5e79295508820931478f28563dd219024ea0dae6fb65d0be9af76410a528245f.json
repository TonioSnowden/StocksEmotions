  "title": "Individual Investors Rout Hedge Funds  ----  By Gunjan Banerji, Juliet Chung and Caitlin McCabe",
  "text": "<p>   The power dynamics are shifting on Wall Street. Individual investors are winning big -- at least for now -- and relishing it. </p><p>   An eye-popping rally in shares of companies that were once left for dead including GameStop Corp., AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and BlackBerry Ltd. has upended the natural order between hedge-fund investors and those trying their hand at trading from their sofas. </p><p>   Individual investors have vaulted the three stocks, which have received hundreds of thousands of mentions across social media since early January, into the ranks of the most traded stocks in the U.S. market. </p><p>   On Wednesday, GameStop shares hit a high of $380 intraday, briefly giving the videogame retailer a market value of $26.5 billion -- more than that of Delta Air Lines Inc. </p><p>   While the individuals are rejoicing at newfound riches, the pros are reeling from their losses. Long-held strategies such as evaluating company fundamentals have gone out the window in favor of momentum. War has broken out between professionals losing billions and the individual investors jeering at them on social media. </p><p>   The frenzy of activity is stirring regulatory and legal concerns, as well as the attention of the Biden administration. The White House press secretary said on Wednesday that its economic team, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, is monitoring the situation. </p><p>   The newbie investors are gathering on platforms such as Reddit, Discord, Facebook and Twitter. They are encouraging each other to pile into stocks, bragging about their gains and, at times, intentionally banding together to intensify losses among professional traders, who protest that social-media hordes are conspiring to move stock prices. </p><p>   \"I didn't realize it was this cultlike,\" said short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research, who has become a particular target of some investors on social media. \"It's just a get-rich-quick scheme.\" </p><p>   The mammoth gains have forced money managers to dump bets that the stocks would fall, magnifying the rally. Bearish investors who took short positions have lost $23.6 billion this year through the close of trading Wednesday on GameStop alone, according to financial analytics company S3 Partners, including $14.3 billion on Wednesday when the stock price jumped 135%, its largest percentage increase in history, to a record $347.51. </p><p>   Sam Daftarian, a 44-year-old recent law school student, said he started trading during 2020's market crash. Among his recent winners: the embattled movie-theater chain AMC, which soared 301% on Tuesday to $19.90, recording its biggest one-day move in history. </p><p>   After buying more than $1,000 worth of the shares last year -- as the stock price hovered around $4 -- he was recently on track to more than double a small options bet on the company, which has been fighting to ward off bankruptcy. </p><p>   He said if he had realized how lucrative trading could be, he wouldn't have sprung for his online law or undergraduate degree. \"Please tell the wolf of Wall Street that the pigeon of San Francisco is gonna eat your lunch,\" he said. </p><p>   Noah Williams, a 36-year-old Atlanta resident, said he has earned close to $150,000 in cash from his GameStop options positions over the past two weeks, allowing him to pay off more than $43,500 of outstanding student loan debt. </p><p>   \"I think the big takeaway is, fundamentals do not apply to retail traders,\" said Mr. Williams. \"It's all about sentiment. The only reason why Tesla is worth what it is is because people believe in that company.\" </p><p>   Mr. Williams recently updated his LinkedIn profile to include a job as a \"Short Squeeze Astronaut,\" a reference to Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, where traders regularly boast that stocks such as GameStop are going \"to the moon,\" alongside rocket ship emojis. He said he doesn't plan to sell his shares until GameStop's share price hits $1,000. </p><p>   The sharp run-up in GameStop and AMC shares comes amid a period of relative calm in the broader stock market. The S&amp;P 500 has slipped about 2.4% this week, leaving it with a small loss for the year. That compares with week-to-date gains of 435% for GameStop and 467% for AMC. Both companies didn't respond to requests for comment. </p><p>   Pinpointing the origins of the GameStop frenzy is difficult, but signs of individual investor interest began to emerge in earnest in 2019 on Reddit forums. At the time, some users began posting screenshots of bullish options positions and debating why the stock could rise. </p><p>   That same year, one Reddit user posted in March that the company was a \"deep value play.\" Another Reddit user noted at the time that Michael Burry, the investor who famously bet against mortgage securities before the late-2000s financial crisis, had built a stake in the company through his investment firm Scion Asset Management LLC. </p><p>   Mr. Burry \"is trying to start an epic short squeeze,\" one user posted on an investing Reddit forum in August 2019, a reference to a phenomenon that occurs when a stock's price begins rising, forcing bearish investors to buy back shares that they had bet would later fall to curb their losses. </p><p>   By 2020, chatter about a possible short squeeze had moved beyond being a working theory among a few users. Post after post noted the elevated short interest in GameStop stock. Even more, many users predicted, new consoles including the PlayStation 5 were coming in late 2020. That alone, they thought, could help lift the share price of the struggling videogame retailer. </p><p>   By early January, GameStop had moved from a stock recommendation to a phenomenon. Users encouraged others to hold the line: \"Do not sell.\" </p><p>   The soaring stock prices of heavily shorted stocks have ensnared some of Wall Street's best traders. Top-performing hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, which managed $12.5 billion at the start of the year, had lost nearly 30% for the year through Friday due largely to its array of bets against companies including GameStop, said people familiar with the fund. </p><p>   With losses mounting, Melvin founder Gabe Plotkin orchestrated an emergency deal Monday in which Citadel LLC, its partners and Point72 Asset Management would immediately invest $2.75 billion into Melvin's fund to help stabilize it. As part of the deal, they got non-controlling revenue shares in Melvin for three years. The move effectively reduced Melvin's reliance on borrowed money and, therefore, the likelihood of margin calls from Melvin's prime brokers. </p><p>   Melvin's put options against GameStop -- bearish contracts that typically profit as stocks fall -- expired in mid-January and it was completely out of GameStop Tuesday. \"Melvin Capital has repositioned our portfolio over the past few days,\" a spokesman said in a written statement. He declined to comment on how much of Melvin's losses came from GameStop. </p><p>   Maplelane Capital LLC, a New York hedge fund that started the year with about $3.5 billion, was down roughly 30% for the year through Wednesday, with its bearish GameStop position a significant driver of losses, said people familiar with the firm. One of the people said the fund has adjusted its portfolio over the past two weeks to preserve capital. </p><p>   The steep loss is rare for Maplelane, started in 2010 by former Galleon Group trader Leon Shaulov. Maplelane has returned an average 29.4% a year since its inception, according to an investor document. </p><p>   Some traders said they had been covering short bets on other stocks because they worry those companies could be the next GameStop. Others have been forced out as stocks like GameStop and AMC soar, triggering their firms' limits on the amount of risk a portfolio manager can take. Hedge funds reduced their exposure to stocks, by trimming their bullish positions and covering bearish ones, on Monday at the sharpest clip since August 2019, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p><p>   Meanwhile, chatter about \"Melvin\" has been dominant on Reddit, according to an analysis by Meltwater, a global media intelligence company, with more than 40,000 posts tied to the firm circulating over the past month. One post gloated: \"We are better at being irrational than Melvin is at being solvent.\" </p><p>   On Jan. 19, a Twitter account identifying itself as moderators for WallStreetBets posted that the forum had long been dismissed, but \"we are also now a powerful force to be taken seriously.\" Some users have expressed concern that the Securities and Exchange Commission would act if users appeared organized. </p><p>   On Discord, in a chat room linked to WallStreetBets, a user on Tuesday posted, \"Guys, we need to pump $GME. Everyone buy 1000 shares in exactly 60 seconds.\" </p><p>   Some on WallStreetBets have targeted Mr. Left of Citron Research, who made his bearish position on the company public. He said he has been trolled by people on the internet, including many who he said harassed family members, including his children. </p><p>   His announcement served as a cue for hordes of other investors to pile into the stock. </p><p>   \"When Citron got involved, that's when I think I wanted more involvement,\" said Danny Faiella, a 33-year-old house painter in Hilo, Hawaii, who has poured about $3,500 into GameStop stocks and options. He has been buying calls tied to GameStop since November -- positions that rapidly jumped in value as the stock soared -- and ramped up the trade after Mr. Left revealed his position. \"I find value in the stocks that he now shorts.\" </p><p>   On Wednesday, Mr. Left said in a video that he closed most of his short position. </p><p>   The extraordinary moves in individual stocks come as trading activity among individual investors has surged during the coronavirus pandemic. In 2020 alone, it is estimated that more than 10 million new trading accounts were created, according to JMP Securities. </p><p>   The mob-like mentality on WallStreetBets has some professional investors calling foul. </p><p></p>",
