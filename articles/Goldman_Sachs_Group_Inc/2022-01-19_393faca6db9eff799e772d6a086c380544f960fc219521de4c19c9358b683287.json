  "title": "Goldman's Long-Term Shift Remains Key",
  "text": "<p>Shares of Goldman Sachs tumbled sharply on Tuesday, down about 7%. Investors might be worried about trading desks, with the bank's reported fourth-quarter trading net revenue down 7% versus the prior year. But it was hardly in free fall. Fixed income, currency and commodities trading revenue was down 1% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 at Goldman, smaller than declines at peers that have reported thus far.</p><p>Equities took a bigger hit, though the drop was driven by intermediation trading rather than financing. This suggests that Goldman's moves amid dislocations in prime brokerage are still paying off. The bank said it set a record in average prime balances.</p><p>The global markets unit's return on average common equity in the fourth quarter was down 8.8 percentage points from a year ago, to 7.5%, as average common equity capital grew while earnings fell. Even so, full-year 2021 returns of 15.3% for global markets were more than a point higher than 2020. That kind of return is well above plan for Goldman, having two years ago envisioned a 10% return for markets on the path to a 13% firmwide return. The firm's overall return on equity was 23% in 2021.</p><p>The bank's big global markets return in 2021 partly reflects the extraordinary pandemic environment in trading, which the bank leaned into. Certainly the sustainability of that performance is a question mark as the world changes. It might not hit the same highs, though the bank could potentially adjust allocated capital to help boost returns above the fourth quarter's level, even with similar or perhaps lower activity.</p><p>But despite how important Wall Street trading still is, investors should keep it in context of the bigger picture at Goldman Sachs. Even if the bank doesn't see quite-so-stellar return on equity in global markets in 2022, healthy revenue and earnings will continue to help generate the resources to fund the bank's longer-term transformation to add more high-return, fee-heavy business.</p><p>The bank is investing in areas such as transaction banking, asset and wealth management and consumer banking. Consumer-banking revenue grew 23% in 2021 over 2020, and wealth-management revenue rose 25%. Goldman's overall deposits grew 40% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. For now, as consumers aren't borrowing heavily, investing in areas like credit cards is expensive because banks still need to service those clients and set aside for future possible loan losses.</p><p>Succeeding in building up newer units to scale and profitability is a key part of reassuring investors that Goldman's long-term returns will be strong, and not so tied to the cyclical nature of markets. That is what could help Goldman's price-to-book ratio, at around 1.3 times, according to FactSet, narrow its gap with peers such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley.</p><p>Markets and investment banking may stay pretty strong in 2022, given a still-robust deal pipeline and what could be a volatile year in interest rates and stocks. Investors who have been inclined to back Goldman Sachs thus far shouldn't jump off too soon.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
