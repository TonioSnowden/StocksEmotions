  "text": "<p>The number of S&amp;P 500 companies appointing black board members has jumped in the wake of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0065ac1-43ed-4b68-9dea-b90d9a131d89\">George Floyd's murder</a> one year ago, according to new research.</p> <p>As scrutiny of white, male corporate boardrooms intensified during the worldwide demonstrations following Floyd's murder, 148 S&amp;P 500 companies appointed a black director, up from just 52 new appointments in the same period a year earlier, according to a report published on Tuesday by ISS Corporate Solutions, a data provider.</p> <p>From July 1 2020 to May 19 2021, a third of newly appointed directors were black, up from 11 per cent from the same period a year earlier, ICS said.</p> <p>Overall, black directors made up 10.6 per cent of S&amp;P 500 board members as of May 19, compared with 8.3 per cent a year earlier and 7.8 per cent in 2019.</p> <p>“The needle has clearly moved,” said Marija Kramer, head of ISS Corporate Solutions. </p> <p>Among recent appointments, Goldman Sachs on Monday named Kimberley Harris, NBCUniversal's general counsel, to its board. When Starbucks designated <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e0b9b0a-13fc-4dbc-9cdc-205894663359\">Mellody Hobson</a> its board chair in December last year, she became the second black woman — after Ursula Burns at Xerox — to chair an S&amp;P 500 company. </p> <p>The pace of change has been fastest at larger companies. Across the broader Russell 3000, black board members comprised just 22 per cent of new appointees from July 1 2020 to May 19 2021, ICS said.</p> <p>The pressure on companies to diversify boardrooms is likely to increase in the months ahead. Nasdaq <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7999e127-9fe4-499b-ad36-1aeecca460cb\">has proposed</a> new listing rules that would require companies to have two diverse directors — including one who self-identifies as female and one who self-identifies as black or another under-represented minority group.</p> <p>Beginning in 2022, the large index fund manager State Street <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e512c76-4733-4821-8425-136ab9b98426\">has said</a> it will also vote against the chair of the nominating and governance committees of companies that do not have at least one minority board member.</p> <p>The ICS analysis also showed that almost half of newly-appointed black board members were new to a public company board, up from 36 per cent the year before.</p> <p>“The pipeline of minority director talent is growing at a faster rate than previously evidenced,” Kramer said.</p><p>Source: Patrick Temple-West in New York 2021 'US companies step up pace of hiring black directors in wake of George Floyd murder  ' FT.com 25 May.
