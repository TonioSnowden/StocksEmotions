  "title": "Former Sears CEO Eddie Lampert Selling $35M Aspen Mansion",
  "text": "<p>Offering over 15,000 square feet of luxe living space and nestled in the breathtaking peaks of Aspen, CO, this fabulous residence truly shimmers thanks to its glass walls.</p><p>It's located in the upscale Starwood neighborhood and outfitted by an esteemed group of architects and interior designers.</p><p>All four of Aspen's mountains can be seen from the home's many windows. The massive great room features a fireplace and plenty of seating.</p><p>Pops of red are strategically placed throughout the home, including on an accent wall behind a huge TV screen, on the felt of the pool table, in the kitchen backsplash, and atop the bar stools.</p><p>High-end amenities include a home theater, a very large office, a gym, and a three-car garage. When it's time to come in from the slopes, potential buyers can peruse the enormous bookshelves or wander into the second entertainment space for a game of cards or air hockey.</p><p>Lampert got his start on Wall Street with Goldman Sachs, became a hedge fund manager, and later took the reins at Sears Holdings in a series of complex transactions. In August, what's left of Sears Holdings reached a $175 million settlement from Lampert and other investors, after accusing them of stripping the company for its real estate assets.</p><p>Alas, Sears is dying on the vine and will likely disappear from malls everywhere. Once numbering in the thousands across the country, Sears today has fewer than two dozen locations.</p><p>This story was originally published on Realtor.com.</p><p>Former Sears CEO Eddie Lampert Selling $35M Aspen Mansion</p>",
