  "title": "UBS Hires  Secondary  Deal Maker  At Lazard  ----  By Preeti Singh",
  "text": "<p>   The private-funds group of investment bank UBS Group AG is adding secondary-deal specialist Abhijit Mitra from Lazard Ltd. to lead its secondary advisory business focused on sponsor-led transactions, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Mr. Mitra is joining the bank in the fall from New York-based Lazard, where he has worked for the past 11 years in its private-capital advisory group, most recently as a managing director. He brings expertise in structuring general-partner-led secondary deals and continuation funds and will join as head of GP Capital Advisory, Americas, reporting to Kevin Kuryla, global head of the bank's private funds group. </p><p>   UBS is building up a global secondaries and fund financing business under Philip Tsai, a New York managing director and the global head of secondary market advisory for the bank. The business recruited Sandro Galfetti, who joined from advisory firm PJT Partners Inc. in London, and Dave Andrias, from investment bank Houlihan Lokey Inc. in New York. </p><p>   Mr. Mitra's move is the latest involving executives of secondary advisers as more asset managers and financial institutions set up teams focused on sponsor-led secondary transactions. </p><p>   Most recently, Guggenheim Securities lured away Orcun Unlu from Citigroup to set up its advisory business, and investment bank Lincoln International LLC hired Dan Posternak and Steve Carre from UBS to start a similar operation. </p><p>   Rising secondary deal volume in recent years prompted other asset managers and financial institutions to get into the business, either by hiring talent from more established players or acquiring boutique shops focused on the market. </p><p>   Investment banks Jefferies Financial Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Raymond James Financial Inc., Mizuho Securities Co., Moelis &amp; Co., Rothschild &amp; Co. and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. have followed suit, seeking to claim a piece of an expanding pie. </p><p>   Secondary-transaction volume surged to a record $134 billion in 2021, more than double the $60 billion level in 2020, according to estimates from investment bank Evercore Inc., which has served as a secondary intermediary. </p><p></p>",
