  "text": "<p>Second, one reason the Omicron variant is \"milder\" than earlier variants is that it is encountering a different population -- one in which many people have some level of immunity to Covid-19, through previous exposure or vaccination.</p><p>Third, there is considerable evidence that we can reduce the social impact of Covid by \"flattening the curve\" if we take actions to limit transmission as long as possible. Hospitals are already overtaxed and understaffed because of Omicron, preventing medical care for people who should be treated for heart attacks, strokes, chemotherapy and surgeries that could improve the quality of their lives. It is therefore misguided to allow large numbers of people to become infected.</p><p>Prof. Michael A.
