  "text": "<p>Alphabet <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2696ea3f-86a8-4652-9301-121ed1c747d8\">sent a tremor through the worlds of digital advertising and ecommerce</a> after the market closed yesterday as it reported an unexpectedly severe slowdown in its core search ads business, prompting a sell-off in tech stocks and fanning fears of an economic slowdown in the US.</p> <p>Third-quarter revenues at the largest seller of digital advertising in the US grew 6 per cent to $69.1bn. Except for a brief contraction at the start of the pandemic, it was the slowest rate of growth since 2013 and fell short of analyst expectations for an increase of 9 per cent, according to Refinitiv.</p> <p>Microsoft added to the gloom for the tech sector as it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88950005-05b1-4708-b6cf-1848376c0a68\">warned of a marked slowdown</a> in its cloud computing business in the coming months.</p> <p>Shares in both Alphabet and Microsoft fell nearly 7 per cent in after-hours trading following the lacklustre results. The news, which came at the start of the earnings season for Big Tech, sparked <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c75e77b-f73f-444d-849f-a904b9c5a679\">a sell-off in shares of other industry leaders</a> including Meta and Amazon, both of which fell more than 4 per cent.</p> <p>Contracts tracking Wall Street's broad S&amp;P 500 index were down 0.75 per cent ahead of the open later today. Those contracts tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 fell 1.6 per cent. </p> <p>The falls after the market closed followed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a83f9a1e-38c3-4155-baab-691694daa578\">an upbeat day on Wall Street</a>. The broad S&amp;P 500 index added 1.6 per cent and the Nasdaq Composite gained 2.3 per cent ahead of those results from Alphabet and Microsoft.</p> <p>On a call with investors, Alphabet chief executive Sundar Pichai said it was “a tough time in the ad market”.</p> <p>The poorly received results were the latest sign of a slowdown in digital advertising and the world's largest economy more broadly as consumers and businesses pulled back on spending at a time of soaring inflation. Marketing budgets are often the first place companies turn to when trying to cut costs.</p> <p>Elsewhere in the tech sector, audio streaming service Spotify — which counts the US as its largest market — said that a “challenging” economic environment had hit its advertising sales in the third quarter.</p> <p>Alphabet's earnings set the stage for Facebook parent Meta, which reports results after the market closes today. Analysts expected its revenues slipped 5 per cent in the third quarter.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Fetterman and Oz clash in TV debate</strong> Former television doctor Mehmet Oz and Pennsylvania lieutenant-governor John Fetterman clashed last night <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a250092-b35c-4682-9ec3-7beb95cb95e6\">in their only debate</a> ahead of next month's US midterm elections. The Pennsylvania race is one of a handful of contests across the country that non-partisan analysts see as a true “toss-up” heading into election day on November 8.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper:</strong> Another state that could prove pivotal in determining whether the Democrats can maintain control of the Senate is Nevada. Christopher Grimes reports on a race <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfb80945-196c-4ccc-ae60-c6f549ed269d\">where support has slipped</a> for Joe Biden's party.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2. First bitcoin ETF loses record amount in initial year</strong> Asset manager ProShares' Bitcoin Strategy fund had the most successful ETF launch in history when it amassed more than $1bn in its first week of trading in October 2021. One year later, it has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d67c7f15-19f0-43a0-9367-54b65861d23b\">lost more of investors' dollars than any other ETF debut</a>.</p> <p><strong>3. Wall Street banks clash over EM equities outlook</strong> Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have taken <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9558c605-6e46-45fa-8a90-32346b06ef40\">diametrically opposed views</a> on emerging market stocks after a punishing $2tn sell-off this year. An MSCI index of EM stocks has slumped about 30 per cent since early January, reflecting declines in markets ranging from China to South Korea.</p> <p><strong>4. Musk signals $44bn Twitter deal on track to close this week</strong> Elon Musk has confirmed on a video call with his advisers that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26c48b8c-cc21-4e9a-af66-713dc15007c3\">he intends to close his $44bn acquisition of Twitter on Friday</a>. Twitter shares rose 2.7 per cent to $52.92 on the news, the highest they have traded since Musk agreed to pay $54.20 a share to buy the company in April.</p> <p><strong>5. European banks' bumper quarter raises prospect of windfall taxes</strong> Europe's largest banks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2fb7f7f4-d2fc-427e-abcf-feb2ade20056\">generated huge profits</a> on the back of increasing interest rates in the third quarter, raising the prospect of governments targeting the lenders with windfall taxes. Deutsche Bank reported one of its strongest quarterly performances since before the financial crisis this morning, while Barclays, Santander, UniCredit, Standard Chartered, HSBC and UBS all beat analysts' estimates.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Company earnings </strong>Before Meta, which reports after the market closes, Boeing is anticipated to record an increase in revenue and a small adjusted profit. Also reporting before the bell are Kraft Heinz, General Dynamics, Hess and Harley-Davidson. Ford reports after the market closes.</p> <p><strong>Monetary policy</strong> The Bank of Canada is expected to raise interest rates by another 0.75 percentage points when officials meet today, according to economists polled by Refinitiv, taking the central bank's policy rate to 4 per cent. Meanwhile, Brazil's central bank concludes its final rate-setting meeting before the run-off election on Sunday. Earlier in the day, wholesale inflation data are released in Brazil.</p> <p><strong>IPO </strong>Intel's self-driving unit Mobileye will start trading on the stock market today under the ticker symbol MBLY. Mobileye has been valued at almost $17bn after it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a67ff6f3-18aa-4cf7-ad6f-264d2b6ba094\">sold 41mn shares</a> yesterday for $21 apiece, having <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f25611f2-e921-4ac4-9a9d-1c8ffb4dc01b\">previously outlined </a>a price target of between $18 and $20. That valuation is below what Intel initially sought, but the IPO price coming in above range represents a rare positive development this year for the US listings market.</p> <p><strong>Economic data </strong>There will be more data on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f34164b-b242-4d06-9dd3-5ede6e3c7c3d\">the cooling US housing market</a>, with new home sales expected to have dropped to 585,000 in September from 685,000 in August. Average mortgage rates have hit a 20-year high, deterring many would-be homebuyers.</p> <p><strong>Diplomacy</strong> US President Joe Biden will <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/17/biden-to-host-israeli-president-isaac-herzog-at-the-white-house-00062120\">host Israeli president Isaac Herzog at the White House</a>, a week before Israel holds elections. Olaf Scholz and Emmanuel Macron will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b589c6ba-aded-42da-8adb-5a6d50b7aec1\">aim to calm rising Franco-German tensions</a> in Paris today after the French president said at last week's EU summit that Berlin risked “isolating itself” in Europe. (Politico)</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Investors hunt for biotech bargains</strong> The Covid generation of newly public biotechs entered the industry's worst bear market since the 2000s after valuations soared during the pandemic and then came crashing down. But now a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/178c886a-afaf-4806-ab8f-873b9b70c980\">gap is opening up</a> between the more robust companies and the rest.</p> <p><strong>How Bolsonaro built a durable right-wing movement</strong> With Brazilians heading to the polls on Sunday, incumbent president Jair Bolsonaro is closing the gap on favourite Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Whether he wins or loses, Bolsonaro has forged a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a4f43a2-8b82-4e64-9dd6-b4d225ad9214\">durable right-wing movement</a> that blends Brazilian conservatism and nationalism with American-style culture war politics and social media battles.</p> <p><strong>Who's who in Team Sunak</strong> Rishi Sunak yesterday became Britain's third prime minister in the space of two months and immediately started to assemble a team to tackle “the profound economic crisis” facing the country. Political correspondents Jim Pickard and Sebastian Payne <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f1aac20-0453-472c-b110-dacadb418508\">explain who's who</a> in the new “unity cabinet”.</p> <p><strong>China's limitless presidency means limited diplomacy </strong>While Xi Jinping seems unassailable at home, foreign diplomacy will become only more difficult, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f22b2616-7232-45f1-bdf2-9524c4ca4061\">writes Yuan Yang</a>. If all policy ultimately originates with the leader, and if he is infallible, then there can be no admission of mistakes, no apologies, no compromises — in short, no diplomacy.</p> <p><strong>Pakistan seeks ‘justice' after floods</strong> When the Indus river burst its banks during heavy rains and flash flooding in late August, the disaster put the country <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e69ece7d-11fb-4a8f-91ea-35b98d4b54db\">at the forefront of an international debate</a> about how to pay for adaptation to the ravages of global warming — and who should pick up the bill.</p> <h1>Reader feedback</h1> <p>Yesterday FirstFT reported on a progressive group of Democrats who wrote to the White House to urge “direct engagement” with Russia. Last night <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b08634e3-b0f2-44d4-9cc3-4b7edc8a1329\">they withdrew the letter</a>, saying it was not meant to convey a split with the Biden administration and was sent by staff “without vetting”.</p> <p>We also asked for your thoughts on the progressives' push for peace and Kevin McCarthy's idea of reducing funding for Ukraine — and received a huge response. Here are some extracts from the emails we received. They have been edited because of space constraints. </p> <p>“I disagree completely with liberal democrats who call for appeasement with Russia. Putin must be defeated or he will expand his hegemony to other European countries, and negotiating with Russia is President Zelenskyy's decision.” <strong>Duncan Pollock, Stockbridge MA, US&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>“Stop Putin here or it's the Baltics and Poland&#xa0;next.” <strong>Sara T Bott, North Palm Beach, Florida</strong></p> <p>“There are too many parallels here with Hitler.&#xa0;Russia has not started a war like this since it attacked Japan in 1905.&#xa0;This is a dangerous break in their policy.” <strong>Elliot Royce, Palm Beach Gardens, Florida&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>“The notion of “retaking Crimea,” which was annexed in 2014, will be “too much” for US Congressional support in my humble opinion. &#xa0;Indeed, negotiating a cease fire, and then peace with new boundaries, appears to be the only real means to hold US support through 2023.”&#xa0;<strong>Jeffrey Allen Bell, Kirkland, Washington, US</strong></p> <p>“Even pre WWII and almost post WWII there were direct contacts.&#xa0; It is imperative to do it now.” <strong>Ike Zach Houston, TX, US</strong></p> <p>“I think the desire to cut aid has to do with accelerating peace negotiations.” <strong>Brad H Birmingham, AL, US</strong></p> <p><em>Thank you for all the responses and do keep them coming. They may feature in a future edition of FirstFT. Finally, nearly 70 per cent of readers who voted in </em><a href=\"https://clients.opinary.com/preview/index.html?url=https://compass.pressekompass.net/compasses/financial_times/do-you-think-joe-biden-should-hold-direc\"><em>yesterday's poll </em></a><em>thought Joe Biden should not seek direct talks with Vladimir Putin.</em> </p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Gary Jones and Emily Goldberg  2022 'FirstFT: Tech tremor' FT.com 26 October.
