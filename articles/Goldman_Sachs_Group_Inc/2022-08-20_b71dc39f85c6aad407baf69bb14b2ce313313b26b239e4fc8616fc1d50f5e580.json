  "text": "<p>A retreat in commodity prices helped galvanize the rally in junk bonds, while a robust jobs market aided beaten-down cyclical sectors, quelled fears of an imminent recession and got investors back to transacting.</p><p>\"A lot of people have been sitting on a cash,\" said Matthew Kennedy, a senior portfolio manager at Angel Oak Capital Advisors. That quickly changed withsigns of inflation slowing, plus a lack of new junk-bond issuance and a deluge of maturing coupons help fuel demand.</p><p>But this week, the rally also spurred debate about if investors were too giddy too fast, particularly with inflation and the Fed's pace of interest rate hikes still wildcards.</p><p>\"There still is a lot of uncertainty in terms of the economy,\" Kennedy said, adding that the central bank's annual inflation target of 2% could be tough to achieve. \"What if it levels out a 3% or 4%? I think the verdict is still out on that.\"</p><p>Read: Powell to tell Jackson Hole that recession won't stop Fed's fight against high inflation</p><p>Cyclical rally</p><p>U.S. stocks and bonds sold off dramatically in the year's first half as the Fed signaled plans to quickly use interest rate rises to cool inflation from 40-year highs.</p><p>The summer stock market rally surprised, with the S&amp;P 500 index SPX bouncing about 17% from its mid-June low, before it began sputtering this week.</p><p>Similarly, junk-rated bonds staged a record rally this summer. Spreads, a key risk gauge, tumbled to about 437 basis points above the risk-free Treasury yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y from a roughly two-year high of 600 basis points in July, according to theICE BofA US High Yield Index.</p><p>As in stocks, recent bullish bets also provided a lift to cyclical junk-bond sectors (see chart), including gaming, leisure and entertainment.</p><p>Even so, credit analysts at Goldman Sachs said they \"think it is too early to get constructive on cyclical junk bond sectors and remain broadly cautious going into the latter part of the year,\" in a weekly client note.</p><p>They expect commodity prices, oil in particular, to rebound into year end, with strains on inventories and geopolitics driving factors that \"crowd out\" discretionary consumer spending. U.S. benchmark crude prices CL00 CLU22 ended the week at a loss, settling at $90.77 a barrel.</p><p>Related:Diesel and natural-gas prices stay high, feeding food price inflation</p><p>The strong U.S. labor market could also produce a \"possible headwind to growth,\" they said, while noting its potential impact to the terminal Fed funds rate.</p><p>Individuals often gain exposure to junks bonds through exchange traded funds, the biggest iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF HYG ended the week flat, but still was up 1.1% from a month ago, according to Factset.</p><p>Kennedy at Angel Oak said his team favors companies with a strong balance sheet and limited refinancing risk. They also remain overweight energy, a big exposure for junk bonds, saying that global production still isn't meeting quotas and that U.S. shale drillers aren't ramping up production because of higher labor costs in a tight jobs market.</p><p>\"I think it's be selective, and very bottom-up focused,\" he said.</p><p>Is the junk bond market too bullish on a soft landing for the economy?</p>",
