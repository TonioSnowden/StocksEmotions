  "text": "<p>   Former President Donald Trump's hosting and dining with two public anti-Semites, Kanye West and Nick Fuentes, and refusing to condemn their anti-Semitism, is a lot more serious than a \"limitless capacity for hearing people tell him things he wants to hear\" or \"eagerness to push the boundaries of acceptable political behavior\" (\"Dinner at Hate for Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago\" by Gerard Baker, Free Expression, Nov. 29). </p><p>   It is also far from being innocent or incidental, as Mr. Trump pretends. Recall that he previously claimed not to know who David Duke is and who the Proud Boys are when he was asked to condemn them. It was his way to garner and keep the support of those who support bigots, racists and anti-Semites. </p><p>   Thankfully, more and more Republican supporters are beginning to see that Mr. Trump is not only hurting the Republican Party but aiding and abetting hate. </p><p>   Abraham Foxman </p><p>    Bergen County, N.J. </p><p>   Mr. Foxman is director emeritus of the Anti-Defamation League. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    As a descendant of Holocaust survivors, I deplore Mr. Trump's meeting with a Holocaust denier, whether intended or inadvertent. To apply consistency, however, writers should also apply the descriptive moniker to Arab leaders who practice Holocaust denial, such as Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, whenever they meet American officials, including President Biden. </p><p>   Daniel Jacobs </p><p>    Orlando, Fla. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Mr. Trump fell back on his stock answer for Mr. Fuentes, but it's irrelevant. He knows Mr. West very well and certainly knows about his deranged and anti-Semitic theories, aired publicly for the past two months. </p><p>   Steven Morris </p><p>    Mt. Pleasant, S.C. </p><p>   --- </p><p>    Your editorial \"Donald Trump's Bad Dinner Guests\" (Nov. 28) is critical of Mr. Trump for not admitting his mistake in hosting two racists and anti-Semites for dinner at Mar-a-Lago. However, the one constant in the universe, the immutable law of nature, is that Mr. Trump doesn't admit mistakes. </p><p>   William Goldman </p><p>    Los Angeles </p><p></p>",
