  "title": "Mexican  Lender's  Refinance  Plan Stalls  ----  By Alexander Saeedy",
  "text": "<p>   Mexican payroll and business lender Credito Real SAB de CV said its planned refinancing of a 170 million-Swiss-franc bond, valued at $184 million, hadn't materialized, pointing to a possible nonpayment and restructuring ahead for the embattled shadow bank. </p><p>   Credito Real has until the end of Wednesday to repay or refinance the outstanding bond, or it could be deemed in default. Failure to pay would likely trigger a cross-default on other debt obligations, including the company's dollar-denominated bonds, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The company also said on Wednesday that it had retained law firm DLA Piper and restructuring adviser FTI Consulting. It is working with its financial stakeholders to evaluate strategic alternatives and \"resolve its short-term and long-term financing situation,\" it said. </p><p>   Bonds for Credito Real have lost almost half their value since late last month over uncertainty on its ability to repay the Swiss bond. </p><p>   The company had been working with Goldman Sachs to help line up secured financing. Last year, it had approached its Swiss investors to refinance the bond, but was rebuffed. </p><p>   Credito Real has borrowed nearly $2 billion from international capital markets since 2016 and won accolades from U.S. institutions for providing banking services to those underserved by Mexico's financial sector. The company provides lending services to consumers and business, but isn't a regulated banking institution in Mexico. </p><p>   But short sellers began to target the company after it disclosed that almost half the assets it had been reporting as loans consisted of accrued interest, indicating that it was struggling to collect from borrowers. </p><p>   A missed payment by Credito Real could hurt the Mexican economy, which is highly dependent on nonbank lending to provide credit to consumers and small businesses. AlphaCredit Capital SA de CV, another large payroll lender, filed for insolvency protection last year after disclosing large accounting errors. </p><p></p>",
