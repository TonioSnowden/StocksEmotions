  "text": "<p><strong>BT</strong> chairman Jan du Plessis is retiring after less than four years in the role. </p> <p>The company announced that Du Plessis will step down this year once&#xa0;a&#xa0;successor has been appointed. The former chairman of Rio Tinto and British American Tobacco said in a statement that “after 17 years of demanding roles as chairman of significant FTSE companies, I know the time is now right for me to step down and focus on other interests.”</p> <p>The exit of Du Plessis follows <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce4a778e-d86e-11e8-ab8e-6be0dcf18713\">pressure in recent years</a> from shareholders including activist investor Greenlight Capital&#xa0;to break up the company.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a8eb45d-c45f-4085-83bb-2f17bdfa2c30\">warned about problems</a> within <strong>Neil Woodford</strong>'s investment business less than a year after it opened in 2014 but did not intervene for almost another two years. Concerns over its investment strategy were raised within the first year of its operation, when two of the company's founding partners — chief operating officer Nick Hamilton and chief legal and compliance officer Gray Smith — resigned after falling out with Woodford and chief executive Craig Newman.</p> <p><strong>Trustpilot</strong> said it plans to float on the London Stock Exchange's main market. The consumer review platform said it made a $12.2m loss last year on revenue of $102m. </p> <p><strong>Bunzl</strong>, the specialist distributor of disposable products, posted a 19.1 per cent improvement in underlying profit for 2020 as bulk buying of gloves and masks helped counter weaker demand from the food service and retail sectors. Adjusted operating profit was £778.4m on revenue up 8.4 per cent to £10.1bn, the company reported.</p> <p>Ladbrokes owner <strong>Entain</strong> has improved its cash offer for Sweden-based peer Enlabs to SKr3.7bn (£310m), which had been rejected by Enlabs' biggest shareholder. The bookmaker raised its offer to SKr53 per share from SKr50 and said its improved bid was final.</p> <p><strong>Restaurant Group</strong> said it had secured £500m of new long-term debt facilities to survive the current lockdown. The Wagamama owner said it expected to continue burning £5.5m a week but said trading was “very encouraging” at the approximately 200 sites that are currently open for delivery and takeaway.</p> <p>Generator hire group <strong>Aggreko</strong> posted a £136m operating loss for 2020 on Covid-19 disruption and the lower oil price. There was no update on the proposed takeover by private equity groups TDR Capital and I Squared Capital, announced last month. </p> <p><strong>Speedy Hire</strong>, the tools and equipment hire provider, said trading since the end of September has been ahead of the board's expectations.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Deutsche Bank </strong>is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7574b505-adb2-42f4-8745-9fe3da9cb5fb\">under pressure </a>over its sale of complex currency products in Spain as regulators await the results of an internal probe into contracts that pushed some small companies into financial distress and led to a series of out-of-court settlements. One finance professor at the Autonomous University of Madrid estimates that between 300 and 500 Spanish companies could have suffered losses on the products, with an average hit of between €5m and €10m, according to people familiar with the cases.&#xa0;</p> <p>The head of <strong>Goldman Sachs'</strong> consumer finance division, Omer Ismail, and one of its top executives, David Stark, are both leaving <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/118b29ba-f118-46ff-b639-675ceb3c1cf6\">to join a fintech start-up</a> backed by <strong>Walmart</strong> and <strong>Ribbit Capital</strong>. Ismail, who has been at the Wall Street bank since 2002, was tapped to lead Goldman's consumer division, known as Marcus, less than six months ago.&#xa0;Stark, a Goldman partner who has been at Marcus since its founding almost five years ago, was recently put in charge of partnerships at the unit.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Warren Buffett</strong> warned <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01f308ff-0a66-4c31-9653-a9c81d940b23\">over the weekend</a> that debt investors faced a “bleak future” days after a sell-off pummelled&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fbafac5-02a9-43dd-ab61-b2ca05cb5264\">government bonds</a>&#xa0;and sent reverberations through global stock markets. The 90-year-old chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway told shareholders in his closely followed annual letter that it was time to eschew the fixed-income market.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Patrick Jenkins</strong> <br>Goldman Sachs and McKinsey&#xa0;had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83948f45-f020-403a-b6e0-cb2239ee09c8\">long enjoyed high standing</a>. But they have suffered in recent years for some of the very reasons that had made them successful — pride in their excellence had turned to arrogance; success had spurred overhasty growth and greed.</p> <p><strong>Ruchir Sharma <br></strong>This year could unfold as a mirror image of 2020, with markets going flat amid soaring economic growth. To understand why, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed6f883f-eaaa-4dfc-85cc-e7d79251c89b\">follow the money</a>.<br><br><strong>Thanks for reading.
