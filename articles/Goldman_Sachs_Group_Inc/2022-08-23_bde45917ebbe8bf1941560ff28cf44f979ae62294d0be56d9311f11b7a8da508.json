  "text": "<h1>To Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond üöÄ</h1> <p>Many good stories in finance begin with a securities <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000886158/000193921022000004/0001939210-22-000004-index.htm\">filing</a>. </p> <p>When <strong>Bed Bath &amp; Beyond</strong>'s shares were gripped in a meme stock spike on the morning of August 17, DD's Antoine Gara started perusing the ailing retailer's public filings. </p> <p>One stood out. It was a filing made by an entity named <strong>FCM</strong> <strong>BBBY</strong> <strong>Holdings,</strong> <strong>LLC </strong>which listed its address as a nondescript Wyoming office building. The filing indicated that the investor had sold out of its investment in Bed Bath shortly after a 60 per cent surge in its share price.</p> <p>The entity's only other filing showed that it built a more than 6 per cent stake in the ailing retailer in July following its disastrous second-quarter earnings results in late June. FCM had made a return of at least 300 per cent in under a month. </p> <p>In its filings, FCM had attached a proposal to Bed Bath's board outlining how it could restructure its debt. </p> <p>It looked like a small hedge fund from Wyoming had tried a cute debt exchange and got lucky when Bed Bath's shares soared amid an August surge in meme stocks. </p> <p>But there was a twist. Antoine and the FT's Madison Darbyshire's digging revealed that a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b83144bd-830e-4e1d-a9a1-a1ee1ba61dab\">20-year-old university student</a> was at the centre of the trade. </p> <p><strong>Jake Freeman </strong>had sold more than $130mn of Bed Bath stock on Tuesday. He had just landed in Los Angeles ready to begin his senior year at the <strong>University of Southern California </strong>when Antoine got a hold of him.</p> <p>Freeman said he hailed from an affluent New Jersey suburb and had created the Wyoming LLC for his Bed Bath shares to avoid his home address being listed. His idea was the genesis of experiences he'd gained interning at an investment fund, he said.</p> <p>Freeman's background sets him apart from the typical <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bce2ef2a-77d8-485e-ba69-92579f8fceb6\">‚ÄúGeneration moonshot‚Äù</a> crowd of risk-chasing young retail investors.</p> <p>His hedge fund mentor, <strong>Vivek</strong> <strong>Kapoor</strong>, a former <strong>Credit</strong> <strong>Suisse</strong> executive and chief investment officer of <strong>Volaris Capital</strong>, confirmed his story. The two were listed on multiple research papers published by Volaris, which manages nearly $1bn.</p> <p>Freeman had also done a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WookCapital/status/1557456818154135552\">long interview</a> of his Bed Bath idea on <strong>Twitter</strong> <strong>Spaces</strong>.</p> <p>There were mysteries, such as how Freeman sourced the initial $27mn to make his investment. He said he raised the capital after pitching the idea to people in his orbit and friends and family, but would not elaborate.</p> <p>DD wonders whether the idea set out in the letter would have worked.</p> <p>Freeman believed Bed Bath could utilise its meme stock status to tender for its debt below par value by offering a goody bag of stock warrants and convertible bonds that capitalised on its high stock volatility. This is reminiscent of <strong>Hertz</strong>'s unsuccessful play to sell stock after it filed for bankruptcy. </p> <p>Was Freeman on to something, or had he gotten extremely lucky in exiting amid a meme stock surge?&#xa0;</p> <p>Bloomberg subsequently <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-18/bed-bath-beyond-is-said-to-tap-kirkland-ellis-for-debt-help\">reported</a> Bed Bath hired <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> to consider restructuring, sending shares plunging 40 per cent. The plunge will probably leave many unlucky retail investors nursing heavy losses.</p> <p>DD wants to hear your analysis of his proposal, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886158/000193921022000002/ex.pdf\">outlined here</a>.

Its flagship fund <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87347d49-390d-408b-9059-2e5a42b5787c\">shed half its value by July</a>, causing billions of investor losses. (The FT's Laurence Fletcher chronicles Tiger's downhill slump in this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/ad86aef6-6243-4546-b8a0-4c249db4495b\">video</a>.)</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/ad86aef6-6243-4546-b8a0-4c249db4495b.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Tiger has led a review of its portfolio that yielded cutting pandemic winners such as <strong>Zoom</strong>, <strong>DocuSign</strong>, <strong>DoorDash</strong> and <strong>Peloton</strong>, which have fuelled a sharp drawdown from the former $90bn-in-assets firm's peak.</p> <p>It has also dramatically slashed its exposure to stocks and pared back its bets that prices will rise while placing more emphasis on its short book, overseen by Coleman, which bets that certain companies will decline in value.</p> <p>Tiger has concentrated its remaining holdings in more stable companies, including large, long-term bets on <strong>Microsoft</strong>, <strong>Atlassian</strong>, <strong>SeviceNow</strong> and Chinese ecommerce group <strong>JD.com</strong>, according to people familiar with the situation and filings. </p> <p>It built large positions in technology giant <strong>Alphabet</strong> and cyber security firm <strong>SentinelOne</strong> before a recent spike in the <strong>Nasdaq</strong>, said sources close to the firm. Significant new positions have emerged in China, where Tiger now counts jobs website <strong>Kanzhun</strong> and electric carmaker <strong>Li</strong> <strong>Auto</strong> as top-10 long positions firm-wide.</p> <p>As its portfolio transforms, so too have some of its important investment roles. </p> <p>China-based partner <strong>Edward Lei</strong> has left the firm after nearly a decade, while<strong> T Rowe Price </strong>portfolio manager <strong>Dai Wang</strong> has been brought in to lead its public stock investments in the country. <strong>Sam Harland</strong>, who helped oversee Tiger's former $1bn position in<strong> Carvana</strong>, has left. Former <strong>Palestra</strong> <strong>Capital Management</strong> analyst <strong>Ben Tso</strong> and <strong>Evan Stanleigh</strong>, a partner at hedge fund <strong>Cadian Capital</strong>, have recently joined, with four more new hires set to join in September.</p> <p>The fund's newest recruits will be part of a recovery strategy that has been described prosaically by one person familiar with Tiger as ‚Äúa focus on not losing money‚Äù.</p> <p>Many issues linger: Tiger's changes are still <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59d1a815-a25d-46cc-8d9f-20920287dc50\">small potatoes</a> compared to its outsized exposure to unprofitable tech companies, Alphaville notes. </p> <p>Moreover, by cutting risk, Tiger is preparing for what could be another leg down in tech stocks if earnings follow valuations downward. It underscores fears that more pain could be in store.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Credit Suisse </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97831096-287a-46bf-b77f-409e99d98c29\">has appointed</a> <strong>Deutsche Bank's</strong> <strong>Dixit Joshi</strong> as chief financial officer and<strong> Bank of Ireland </strong>CEO<strong> Francesca McDonagh</strong> will be appointed chief operating officer.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Shalev Hulio </strong>is stepping down as CEO of Israeli spyware company <strong>NSO Group</strong>.
