  "title": "Banking & Finance: Bank of America to Shuffle Ranks --- Two high-level officers who saw institution through financial crisis will depart this year",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Moynihan is shuffling leadership at the second-largest bank in the U.S. after more than a decade at the helm. Many of his top executives have served long tenures, and, in recent years, he has been under pressure to make room for rising talent. The bank said it would announce a succession plan for the departing executives in the coming weeks.</p><p>Bank of America is the only major Wall Street bank that hasn't replaced its CEO recently or publicly set in motion a competition for the top spot. Mr. Moynihan hasn't indicated he plans to retire soon.</p><p>Still, the departure of Mr. Montag and Ms. Finucane makes way for big changes at the top. Mr. Montag's units were responsible for almost half of the bank's revenue last year. Ms. Finucane grew close to Mr. Moynihan through many years of working with him.</p><p>Mr. Montag and Ms. Finucane saw the bank through its darkest days during the financial crisis in 2008-09, and they helped it mount a slow recovery in the aftermath. Their work paid off: Bank of America, like other big banks, proved much more resilient when the coronavirus pandemic shut down businesses across the country and put millions of Americans out of work.</p><p>Mr. Montag left Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to join Merrill Lynch before it was acquired by Bank of America in the heat of the crisis. He worked to rebuild the firm's investment banking and trading divisions after the subprime crisis hobbled Merrill and forced its sale. Still, it has trailed peers in the years since, including during the recent pandemic-induced boom in trading and deal making.</p><p>Ms. Finucane worked alongside Mr. Moynihan at FleetBoston Financial Corp., before it was acquired by Bank of America in 2004, and served as chief marketing officer when the bank sought to rebrand itself after the financial crisis. More recently, she has been focused on sustainable investing, an area she said she would continue to focus on after her retirement.</p><p>Ms. Finucane had been thinking about retiring for a while, but the pandemic delayed her plans, she said in an interview. Bank of America, she said, \"is in great shape and in good hands.\"</p>",
