  "text": "<p>The verdict capped a nearly two-month trial and delivered a win to the Justice Department in its yearslong push to hold individuals accountable for the looting of 1Malaysia Development Bhd., a state-controlled economic development company known as 1MDB.</p><p>The global scandal has been a black mark for Goldman and led to the conviction of a former prime minister in a Malaysian court.</p><p>Federal prosecutors accused Mr. Ng of conspiring with a well-connected financier and a former Goldman partner to pay off officials to win the Wall Street bank lucrative business deals with 1MDB. Goldman raised $6.5 billion in bond offerings for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013, earning hundreds of millions of dollars in fees.</p><p>Much of the $6.5 billion was diverted to offshore bank accounts and shell companies to pay bribes and kickbacks, according to prosecutors. The stolen money was allegedly used to buy a $250 million yacht and luxury real estate and to finance the movie \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\"</p><p>Mr. Ng, the first defendant in the U.S. case to face a jury, took part in the scheme to win accolades at Goldman and to notch $35 million in kickbacks, prosecutors alleged.</p><p>\"Why did he do it?\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Alixandra Smith said of Mr. Ng during closing arguments. \"Simple: glory and greed.\"</p><p>Breon Peace, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, said the scheme was massive in scale and that Mr. Ng and his cohorts were brazen.</p><p>\"Today's verdict is a victory for not only the rule of law, but also for the people of Malaysia for whom the fund was supposed to help, by raising money for projects to develop their country's economy,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Ng, a former managing director at Goldman and a Malaysian national, had been in New York awaiting trial since 2019.</p><p>His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said he was surprised by Friday's verdict and planned to file a motion to set aside the conviction. Mr. Ng still faces charges in Malaysia.</p><p>During the trial, Mr. Agnifilo said his client was innocent and was a scapegoat for former Goldman partner Timothy Leissner, who previously pleaded guilty to violating antibribery laws and conspiring to launder money. Mr. Leissner has been cooperating with federal investigators and was the government's star witness at the trial.</p><p>Over several days of testimony, Mr. Leissner described how he, Mr. Ng and Malaysian financier Jho Low plotted whom to bribe during a 2012 London meeting and crisscrossed the globe to seal deals. Prosecutors have accused Mr. Low of masterminding the heist and using his relationships with top Malaysian government officials to steal $1.42 billion for himself and his associates. Mr. Low has been indicted but is still at large.</p><p>Mr. Agnifilo said Mr. Leissner, Mr. Ng's former boss, wasn't credible and was testifying in hope of securing a lenient sentence.</p><p>Mr. Leissner told jurors that he received more than $60 million of stolen funds. He also admitted that he initially provided false information to federal investigators when he began cooperating.</p><p>\"This is lying on a rare level,\" Mr. Agnifilo said during closing arguments. \"This is not everyday lying.\"</p><p>The 1MDB scandal chastened Goldman. The bank paid more than $5 billion in penalties to the U.S. and Malaysia and took away compensation from some top executives. It also admitted that a subsidiary broke U.S. corruption laws. Its board called the matter an \"institutional failure.\"</p><p>A spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on Friday's verdict.</p><p>Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was sentenced in 2020 to 12 years of imprisonment after a court in his country found him guilty of abuse of power in connection to the scandal. He is appealing the conviction, according to a spokesman for his lawyers.</p><p>The government called 26 witnesses during the Ng trial, including current Goldman employees. Prosecutors alleged that Mr. Leissner directed wire transfers totaling $35 million in stolen money to accounts controlled by Mr. Ng and his family members.</p><p>Mr. Ng's wife testified that the $35 million was actually money from a business investment that one of Mr. Leissner's former wives returned to her.</p><p>Prosecutors also accused Messrs. Ng and Leissner of hiding Mr. Low's role in helping Goldman secure the 1MDB bond deals because they knew the bank's compliance teams had previously raised concerns about the source of the financier's income.</p><p>Mr. Agnifilo said that Mr. Ng didn't conceal Mr. Low's involvement and had previously warned Goldman about the financier when he tried to become a client of the bank.</p><p>\"Roger is basically the fall guy for this whole thing,\" Mr. Agnifilo said in his closing arguments.</p>",
