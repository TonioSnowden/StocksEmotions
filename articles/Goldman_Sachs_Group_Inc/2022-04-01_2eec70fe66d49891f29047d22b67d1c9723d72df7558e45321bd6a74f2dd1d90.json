  "title": "Rouble payment demand consolidates Europe's plan to wean itself off Russian gas",
  "text": "<p>Good morning and welcome to Europe Express. </p> <p>The full repercussions of Russian president Vladimir Putin's decree obliging European countries to <strong>pay in roubles</strong> for the gas they're importing are still being weighed in EU capitals. (Here's the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4699b68-cf17-4b97-aaf0-336b541bb7f1\">explainer</a> on it.)</p> <p>After Berlin and Vienna activated the first stage of energy rationing plans, and German vice-chancellor Robert Habeck said that “every kilowatt hour of energy saved helps”, Europe seems to be gearing up for the prospect of Moscow turning off the taps. </p> <p>We'll bring you up to speed with the latest in the rouble saga and explore the difficulties the EU faces in replacing Russian supplies in the short term.</p> <p>One likely beneficiary of Russia's energy decoupling from Europe is China — though not in the short term, given that more infrastructure has to be built first. The EU is holding its virtual summit with the Chinese leadership later today (as we wrote <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/663ab1a4-f0a6-4ffd-8b5c-9487a19c4155\">here</a>). The EU will focus on dissuading Beijing from siding with Moscow in its war in Ukraine.</p> <p>And with the French presidential election just over a week away, we'll hear about a <strong>consultancy scandal</strong> that could ruffle some feathers in the camp of Emmanuel Macron.</p> <h2>A matter of (dis) trust</h2> <p>If EU member states needed further lessons in the risks of continuing to do business with Vladimir Putin, the saga over the Russian president's demand for rouble payments has provided one, write <em><strong>Sam Fleming and Valentina Pop in Brussels.</strong></em></p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8ee2429-7caf-4e1f-9c85-dd1f825d36e3\">presidential decree</a> yesterday confirmed that Russia will stop supplying gas to countries it deems “unfriendly” unless they pay for the energy in roubles. A list of 48 of such countries was previously published by the Russian government, and it includes the EU.</p> <p>G7 ministers have already made clear that insisting on payment in Russian currency is an unacceptable breach of contracts with the Russian gas supplier.</p> <p>As such, some member states including Germany and France have been preparing for the worst, as they countenance the possibility of interruptions in gas supplies from Russia. But officials were last night still working to understand what the decree means, as they seek to reconcile apparently contradictory statements coming out of Moscow. </p> <p>The decree requires buyers of Russian gas to open rouble and foreign currency accounts at Gazprombank (which is not subject to sanctions by the EU). Some diplomats and officials are playing down the significance of the change, arguing that it still appears to allow contracts to be paid in euros, which would then be switched to roubles. </p> <p>But the confusion on the Kremlin's goals and tactics did nothing to alleviate fears in western capitals over Putin's willingness to use Russian hydrocarbons as a political tool against the EU. The episode will only cement EU capitals' determination to rapidly curb reliance on Russian gas — including Berlin, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de704c90-dc68-4747-86ef-551f1ffbcb04\">last week</a> set itself the goal of largely weaning itself by 2024. </p> <p>Achieving that will be enormously challenging. The EU hasn't secured alternative supplies that would compensate for a full halt in Russian deliveries — even with the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f106e55-6646-4018-89f7-0159d11f3196\">pledge</a> by the US last week to increase its LNG deliveries to Europe. </p> <p>Part of the problem is infrastructure: Germany has no LNG terminal and relies on its western neighbours Belgium and the Netherlands to re-gasify the LNG supplies for them, in terminals that have very little extra capacity left. </p> <p>In addition, the pipeline infrastructure shipping gas from north-western Europe to Germany is not designed for the amounts that industry-heavy southern states such as Bavaria are used to receiving from Russian sources. Berlin said it had <a href=\"https://www.tradewindsnews.com/gas/germany-snares-fsru-trio-from-two-owners-as-it-steers-away-from-russian-gas/2-1-1190509\">secured</a> three floating regasification units — but even setting the first one up and having it run at full capacity will take many months, as the Financial Times wrote <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc5f79a6-729e-47ff-bf46-cb23c460fa6f\">here</a>. </p> <p>There are also big questions over how quickly alternative supplies can be brought on stream. Pipeline gas coming mainly from Azerbaijan via Turkey and Italy is one example. </p> <p>Azerbaijan's ambassador to the EU, Vaqif Sadıqov, said yesterday that while his country could increase supplies this year by small quantities, Europe should not expect the pipeline to run at full capacity (30-35bcm) by the end of 2022. </p> <p>Currently Azerbaijan ships gas at half the pipeline's capacity, he said. Doubling that would require long-term contracts for the exploitation of additional gasfields in the Caspian Sea, which would be conceivable for the medium term but would hardly solve Europe's energy problems anytime soon.</p> <h1>Chart du jour: Impact on wages</h1> <p><em>This was supposed to be the year European wages started to catch up with inflation, but the economic fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine leaves many EU workers facing even bigger pay cuts in real terms, according to union officials and executives. (</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed477fe9-46fa-43d0-b315-4170763261c2\"><em>More here</em></a><em>)</em></p> <h2>Election scandal</h2> <p>It looks like the perfect French scandal with which to attack Emmanuel Macron just as he seeks a second term of office in the April presidential election: more than €1bn spent on expensive consulting firms such as McKinsey by the administration of the former Rothschild banker, a man condemned by his rivals as the “president of the rich”, writes <em><strong>Victor Mallet in Paris.</strong></em></p> <p>So it is that Macron's opponents have pounced gleefully on the report of a Senate commission of inquiry into “the influence of consultancies”, which concluded that the French state was in the grip of a “tentacular phenomenon” of highly paid advisers. Central government ministries alone spent €893.9mn on them in 2021, more than double the amount in 2018. </p> <p>It's not clear yet how much impact the controversy will have on public opinion in the remaining days before the first round of voting on April 10. </p> <p>The Senate is dominated by opposition parties and the four-month investigation was launched by the “Communist, republican, citizen and environmental” group of leftwing parliamentarians. Nor could it find any examples of laws that were broken, given that such alleged octopus-like activities are not forbidden even if they are undesirable; perhaps they were thinking of investment banks and the “vampire squid” Goldman Sachs. </p> <p>Macron's ministers have hit back, noting that the consultancy bill was equivalent to only 0.3 per cent of public sector salaries and that the money went to 2,000 different firms — including many French ones as well as McKinsey. </p> <p>France, furthermore, spent only a quarter as much proportionately as the UK, according to budget minister Olivier Dussopt, who said the UK spent 1.2 per cent of state wages on external consulting. For Germany (1.3 per cent), Austria (1.4 per cent) and Denmark (1.5 per cent), the figures were even higher, he said. </p> <p>“These practices are habitual, widely spread and in the great majority of cases useful,” said Amélie de Montchalin, civil service minister. The two ministers said much of the money was spent on IT services and the emergency rollout of operations such as the supply of vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic. </p> <p>Still, the government, conscious that some of the mud may stick, has promised to cut back on strategic and organisational consultancy spending this year. Macron opponent Xavier Bertrand, the conservative president of Hauts-de-France region in the north, said yesterday&#xa0;he was “absolutely not convinced” by the official explanations. </p> <h1>What to watch today </h1> <ol>  <li><p>First EU-China summit since 2020 takes place virtually</p></li>  <li><p>European Parliament president Roberta Metsola visits Kyiv</p></li> </ol> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Central bank doctrines: </strong>The Association Europe-Finances-Régulations has compiled a <a href=\"https://www.aef.asso.fr/issues/journal-of-financial-economics/144-new-doctrines-in-central-banking\">special issue</a> of articles by central bankers and economists devoted to the changes in central bank doctrines over the past decades, and in particular since the financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic.
