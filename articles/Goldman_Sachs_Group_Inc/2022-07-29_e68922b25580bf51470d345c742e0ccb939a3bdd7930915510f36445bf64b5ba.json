  "text": "<p>The deal announced Wednesday raises some taxes and limits prescription drug price increases, both of which would help slow inflation, economists said. But it also raises spending on climate and healthcare programs, which could add more upward pressure on prices. Overall, the agreement reduces the federal deficit by about $300 billion over a decade, according to Senate Democrats.</p><p>The net effect, economists said, would likely restrain price increases. But that effect will be relatively small and won't show up for several years.</p><p>\"You add it all up, it will lean against inflation,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"This is by no means a game-changing piece of legislation. It's relatively small in the grand scheme of things.\"</p><p>Goldman Sachs economists estimate the spending and revenue effects would represent less than 0.1% of the economy in the first part of the decade and about 0.2% after 2028.</p><p>The proposal would likely not offer much short-term help to the Federal Reserve in its effort to cool inflation this year. Still, if enacted, it could take some pressure off Fed officials in later years, economists said.</p><p>\"I personally think that we're going to be wrestling with inflation for many years to come,\" said Jason Furman, a Harvard University economist. \"So help two years from now is welcome.\"</p><p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she didn't have an estimate for the extent to which the bill could reduce inflation. But she said the measures to reduce the cost of prescription drugs and subsidize healthcare premiums would lower costs.</p><p>\"These are two important contributions that we should see come into play as soon as the legislation is passed and put into effect. Beyond that there is deficit reduction in the bill, and over time I see deficit reduction as an appropriate accompaniment to the policy changes,\" she said.</p><p>---</p><p>Andrew Duehren contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
