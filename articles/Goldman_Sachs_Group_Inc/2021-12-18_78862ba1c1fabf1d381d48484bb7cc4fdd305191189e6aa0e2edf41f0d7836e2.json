  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Inside AMC's Crazy Upside Down Bonkers Year of Apes, Memes & Shorts --- A rowdy group of investors saved the movie-theater chain -- and then made CEO Adam Aron play by their rules",
  "text": "<p>Even AMC warned against entering its latest stock offering in June \"unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.\" By then, individual investors, locking arms on social media, had buoyed AMC shares to a high of $72.62 from $2.20 at the start of the year. The offering sold out in a day, and the new investors ended up owning more than 80% of the company.</p><p>The AMC rescue and takeover sprang from a serendipitous gathering of mostly amateur investors sharing tips on the internet. Their mass participation was empowered by Robinhood, Webull and other apps that for many users made online trading cheap, easy and as thrilling as a night at the casino.</p><p>At the start of the year, these traders went from niche social group to a market force, making investment decisions not guided by research reports from Wall Street banks, but by what online pals and personalities were saying.</p><p>AMC and videogame retailer GameStop Corp. emerged as crowd favorites. Many of these amateur investors believed buying the stocks amounted to a populist revolt against finance predators who had bet on the companies' fall. Some swore they would never sell their shares.</p><p>\"It was the 99% against the 1%. It was us going against the hedge funds,\" said Katherine Larsen, a 40-year-old bartender from Oceanside, Calif. She put her life savings into AMC stock.</p><p>\"I love the movies, we used to go every week. It was a huge thing for us to fight, and I knew there was a bunch of people coming together for this battle,\" she said. \"I wanted to be in this war for sure.\"</p><p>Ms. Larsen and other AMC shareholders call themselves the apes, a reference to the 2011 film \"Rise of the Planet of the Apes,\" an installment of the movie franchise that showed how a raucous mob of primates came to brutally dominate mankind. The apes made AMC their personal cause, hiring planes to tow promotional banners over Hollywood and renting billboards in Las Vegas and New York's Times Square, all paid for with crowdsourced funds.</p><p>In trying to keep AMC alive, Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron embraced the ape movement. He adopted some of its ideas, accepting cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Dogecoin for movie tickets and screening mixed-martial arts matches from Ultimate Fighting Championship. He also surrendered to the apes on one of AMC's biggest decisions.</p><p>The company had raised more than $2 billion, but with the pandemic dragging on, Mr. Aron wanted twice that to ensure AMC outlasted Covid-19. The CEO sought shareholder support to pad the company's war chest by issuing more new shares. After taking control, the new investors shot down the idea, believing it would dilute the value of the shares they already owned.</p><p>\"It's their company,\" Mr. Aron said in August at AMC's headquarters in Leawood, Kan. \"Any professional management team has to marry what they think the company should do with the reality of what the owners of the company think it should do.\"</p><p>Tremayne \"Trey\" Michael Collins, a 24-year-old Army officer in Oklahoma, is a leading voice of the ape movement. He says to forget about AMC's business fundamentals and instead put trust in the ape collective.</p><p>\"This isn't a trade about fundamentals. It's just not,\" he said in July. \"The moment you mention the word fundamentals, you don't get the trade.\"</p><p>Such advice has won Mr. Collins nearly 400,000 YouTube subscribers to his show \"Trey's Trades,\" where he promotes unproved conspiracies against the apes and urges AMC shareholders to hold on to the stock. Contrary views aren't welcome.</p><p>Financial analyst Rich Greenfield of Lightshed Partners cited AMC's pre-pandemic losses, a $5 billion debt load and changing consumer habits to conclude the company was unlikely to ever be profitable again. The stock, he said in a March 10 report, would eventually decline to a penny.</p><p>Apes responded with menacing online messages. \"There were obscene sexual attacks on me and my wife, attacks on my kids, it was just inhumane,\" said Mr. Greenfield, who started his career at Goldman Sachs. One AMC shareholder wished him a slow and painful death.</p><p>The stock price has since fallen by more than half from its June peak. The company continues to lose money, and streaming services are still growing. AMC senior executives have sold tens of millions of dollars worth of shares this year, benefiting from the investors' lingering fervor.</p><p>Mr. Aron, 67 years old, has stuck close with the apes, making repeat appearances on Mr. Collins's YouTube show and applauding the faithful.</p><p>\"It's like a you-scratch-my-back-I-scratch-yours sort of thing,\" Mr. Collins said of Mr. Aron scrapping more stock offerings. \"To some extent, he's gotta feel like he kinda owes it a little bit to people, just like we owe it a little bit to him for helping out the apes.\"</p><p>Mr. Collins and other ape influencers exhort AMC investors to hold their shares, predicting the stock will skyrocket again soon.</p><p>Wall Street investors, attuned to traditional business measures, largely see financial trouble ahead. Only one side will be right.</p><p>The birth of AMC stretches back a century, to a vaudeville act that performed in small towns around the U.S. After the group disbanded, its founder, Edward Durwood, moved his family to Kansas City, and in 1920 he bought a theater to get a foothold in the emerging moving-pictures business.</p><p>Mr. Durwood's sons took over Durwood Theatres, which remained a family business. In 1961, Stanley Durwood became chief executive and renamed the company American Multi-Cinema, now known as AMC. Over the years, the company pioneered stadium-style seating and armrest cupholders. It popularized the multiplex theaters that anchored malls and shopping centers across suburban America and later spread to Europe and the Middle East.</p><p>AMC went public in the early 1980s, riding the success of the Hollywood blockbuster boom that delivered such hits as the \"Star Wars\" trilogy and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\" But by the 1990s, AMC and its competitors overbuilt and got trapped under the weight of too many screens, as many as 20 under one roof.</p><p>AMC was taken over by Wall Street institutions and private-equity firms, including J.P. Morgan and Apollo Global Management in the early 2000s. It was acquired by investment firm Dalian Wanda Group in 2012 for $2.6 billion. At the time, the deal was among the biggest U.S. acquisitions by a Chinese company.</p><p>Wanda Group's cash helped AMC add comfy recliners and other theater improvements intended to boost stagnating ticket sales. The firm took AMC public in 2013 at $18 a share. AMC acquired two smaller chains, Odeon and Carmike, in 2016 -- acquisitions that made it the biggest exhibitor in the world.</p><p>The expansion also saddled the company's balance sheet with underperforming, fixer-upper movie houses while facing new competition from streaming services. By the end of 2016, Netflix Inc. had 94 million subscribers. At the start of 2020, it had more than 180 million.</p><p>Hollywood studios, the lifeblood of the theater business, invested in keeping more viewers at home, seated on comfy couches, fixed on 65-inch TV screens and immersed in multi-speaker surround sound. By 2020, every major studio but one had a streaming service.</p><p>AMC started to look like the Pony Express well before Covid-19. Earnings declined 17% in 2019, and the company lost $149 million.</p><p>In February 2020, the share price dropped to a low of $6.26. A couple of weeks later, Disney announced its flagship streaming service had topped 100 million subscribers. When the pandemic forced AMC to shut its theaters, shares fell to less than $3.</p><p>Sam Rappold, 34, who was working as the manager of an AMC theater in Huntington, N.Y., recalled the day he told his staff the location was closing. He and his employees unplugged food freezers, divvied up perishables to take home and emptied beer kegs down the drain.</p><p>\"Today, we have to throw out the beer. Tomorrow, it will be the zombies,\" Mr. Rappold said one of his colleagues had joked.</p><p>AMC screens went dark, but the company still had to pay interest on its debt, as well as some rent. The company strung together a couple of debt-financing deals, but as the pandemic continued, lenders, including its former owner Apollo, pushed AMC to consider filing for bankruptcy. They offered a $1 billion loan to finance chapter 11 proceedings.</p><p>Mr. Aron rejected the overture. In August 2020, AMC reopened around 100 theaters. By then, Hollywood studios had either shipped their biggest releases to streaming services or delayed movie debuts by months or years.</p><p>Desperate for cash, AMC tried a long-shot play in September last year -- selling new shares in something called an \"at-the-market\" equity offering, which was open both to institutional firms and individual investors.</p><p>It went better than expected. AMC raised about $55 million. Still, it wasn't close to what it needed. Most of its U.S. theaters had reopened but attendance was so sparse that the company was burning money even faster. In October 2020, AMC was on track to run out of cash by the end of the year.</p><p>AMC's troubles drew short sellers -- primarily hedge funds and other Wall Street institutions betting on the stock to fall. By December 2020, roughly 60% of AMC's shares were tied to these bearish bets, mostly by hedge funds, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, of S3 Partners LLC, a technology and data-analytics firm for the financial-services industry.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
