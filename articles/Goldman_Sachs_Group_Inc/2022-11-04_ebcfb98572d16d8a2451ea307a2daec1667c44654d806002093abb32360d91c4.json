  "title": "Iron-Ore Prices Buckle as China Property-Market Slump Drags On; Party congress in Beijing offers little support for sector that is a key driver of global steel demand",
  "text": "<p>Analysts say iron-ore supply is outstripping demand as China builds fewer new homes, while last month's Communist Party congress disappointed those who had hoped for policies to revive the property market. At the same time, authorities continue to impose snap lockdowns to contain Covid-19 outbreaks.</p><p>Iron ore is often seen as a bellwether of China's economy. The Chinese property market accounts for roughly a third of global demand for iron ore that is shipped by sea, investment bank Jefferies estimates. China—which makes more than half the world's steel—buys seven out of every 10 tons overall, according to data from the Australian government.</p><p>\"The much-anticipated 20th CPC national congress failed to deliver any concrete policies to stimulate the gloomy property market,\" said Malan Wu, head of steel and raw materials markets at consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. \"Instead, the property-market slump continues without signs of recovery in the near future.\"</p><p>There are some bright spots for steel demand, analysts, miners and others say. China is spending more on infrastructure, and auto makers are expanding output after the pandemic disrupted supply chains. Still, this isn't enough to offset the loss of demand from the real-estate sector, Ms. Wu said.</p><p>Iron ore's daily benchmark price fell to $79.50 a metric ton on Oct. 31, its lowest point since November 2019, according to S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, which assesses market prices. The price has edged up in recent days to trade at $83.75 a ton on Thursday. Iron ore began last month above $95 a ton and traded as high as $162 a ton in March.</p><p>Although some banks, including Jefferies, think prices could stabilize if bad weather disrupts major mining hubs again, others aren't so optimistic. Citi and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group are among those to have cut their short-term pricing forecasts.</p><p>Iron ore's downturn is likely to ease pressure on steelmakers by helping to lower raw-material costs at a time when they are being squeezed by weaker steel prices, but it will hurt profits of mining companies including BHP Group Ltd. and Rio Tinto PLC.</p><p>In a report last month, Rio Tinto—the world's largest iron-ore producer—said a loss of confidence in China's property market and Covid-related disruptions to construction activity had curtailed the nation's steel output. It said a slowing global economy generally risked hurting demand for commodities.</p><p>\"While stimulus has produced growth in infrastructure and autos, we expect improvement in the housing sector to take a bit longer,\" James Agar, BHP's group procurement officer, told an industry conference in Australia on Wednesday. \"The zero-Covid policy remains an overhang that creates additional uncertainty.\"</p><p>Other commodity prices have fallen, but not by nearly as much as iron ore. Copper, which dropped by 1.5% in October, is about 30% below its record-high in March when Russia's invasion of Ukraine drove up prices for the industrial metal.</p><p>Copper supplies remain tight and analysts view the metal as essential to electrification projects that Chinese policy makers are pushing to cushion the property slowdown's impact.</p><p>Share Your Thoughts</p><p>What's your outlook on iron ore and other commodities? Join the conversation below.</p><p>In contrast, iron ore faces a worsening oversupply as steel-intensive property development falls, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs. Beijing has imposed borrowing limits on developers while insisting that houses are for living in, not for speculation.</p><p>\"There is little to offset these structural headwinds,\" Goldman said in a note last month, highlighting a 35% fall in new property starts in China year-over-year and steel's lesser role in the energy transition when compared with copper. The bank predicts iron-ore prices will fall to $70 a ton soon.</p><p>The dearth of policy support at the recent party congress in China has coincided with production cutbacks at steel mills and rolling lockdowns across the country, Citi analysts said on Wednesday when cutting their three-month iron-ore price forecast to $70 a ton from $95 a ton.</p><p>China has maintained its zero-Covid strategy via swift and sweeping lockdowns, compulsory quarantines and—in certain cases—business closures. A Chinese industrial park where Foxconn Technology Group's most advanced iPhone plant is battling a Covid-19 outbreak entered a weeklong lockdown on Wednesday.</p><p>A change to China's Covid strategy could arrest the decline in iron-ore prices, said Daniel Hynes, an analyst at ANZ. Without such a pivot, the market backdrop is likely to deteriorate more, he said.</p><p>\"There are very few signs that we can see that things will turn around,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Rhiannon Hoyle at rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com</p><p>Iron-Ore Prices Buckle as China Property-Market Slump Drags On</p>",
