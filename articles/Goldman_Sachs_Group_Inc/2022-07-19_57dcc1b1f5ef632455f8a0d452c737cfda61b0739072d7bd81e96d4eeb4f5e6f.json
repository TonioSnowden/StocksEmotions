  "title": "Copper Sends Bearish Signal --- Slide in prices has even the metal's bulls starting to feeling pessimistic",
  "text": "<p>Prices of copper, used in everything from buildings to cars, collapsed in recent weeks. Prices on the London Metal Exchange are trading around $7,000 per metric ton, down 26% from the beginning of June and 32% since the end of March. Even some of the biggest copper bulls have begun to sound a bearish note. Goldman Sachs forecasts $6,700 a ton in the coming three months -- and a possible move below $6,000 in the case of a global recession.</p><p>Part of the slide is due to the bearish sentiment chewing away at nearly every economically sensitive asset. But the problem is undoubtedly specific to copper too. China, which consumes about half the world's supply, is in trouble. The U.S. appears likely to head into recession. And Europe faces the prospect of a deep industrial downturn this winter if Russia turns the screws on its gas supply.In a scenario like that, copper has nowhere to hide. The seemingly endless rally in the dollar, which makes commodities priced in dollars more expensive abroad, is the coup de grace.</p><p>The slide in copper prices began after China imposed lockdowns in April to defeat a large-scale Omicron outbreak. And while the Chinese light industry and exports have begun to bounce back, its property sector -- the largest source of global copper demand -- is in deep trouble. Data released Friday showed property investment falling 9.4% year over year. Many home buyers who are paying mortgages but have yet to receive their apartments are threatening to withhold payment.</p><p>Meanwhile, there is no clear sign of when China will abandon its \"dynamic zero covid\" policy, which entails frequent testing and targeted, aggressive lockdowns when necessary.</p><p>Nick Pickens, copper research director at Wood Mackenzie, believes that even though many Chinese cities are reducing mortgage rates for first-time buyers and easing home-purchasing rules, consumers and companies are reluctant to spend amid the uncertainty. For now, it's clear China is unlikely to stage a strong recovery to make up for a possible recession in developed markets.</p><p>If that recession comes, it could be nasty in Europe, given the region's high exposure to global energy prices. The biggest pipeline carrying Russian gas to Germany began annual maintenance last week, but markets are worried the shutdown could be extended -- and that Russia may play the gas card in earnest this winter to pressure Europe over Ukraine. If that happens, energy rationing is likely. According to Australian bank ANZ, a 10% cut in European manufacturing activity, which is highly dependent on fuel supply, could reduce the European Union's gross domestic product by 0.5% to 1.0% in any one quarter.</p><p>If there's one saving grace, it's that inventories are relatively low. London Metal Exchange copper stocks stood at just over 130,000 tons on Friday, up 47% from the beginning of the year but less than half of where they were five years ago. Stocks in Shanghai are sitting at low levels by historical standards. If the U.S. and Europe do better than expected, that could help offset some pressure from China. But it probably isn't enough for a significant rally until the country turns the corner.</p><p>Copper's forecasting skills are a matter of lively debate. But with China's economy showing few signs of life -- and the current economic expansions in the U.S. and Europe in mortal peril -- it's hard to argue with the bearish signal it is sending right now.</p>",
