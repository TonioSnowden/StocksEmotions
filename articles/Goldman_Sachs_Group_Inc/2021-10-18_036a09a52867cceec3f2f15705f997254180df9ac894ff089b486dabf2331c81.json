  "text": "<p>Top News</p><p>Fed's Barkin Says He Is Open To Taper Debate</p><p>Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin declined to say when he would like the central bank to pull back on its asset-buying stimulus effort, but said that time is drawing closer.</p><p>\"We're going to have a discussion in November on tapering,\" Mr. Barkin said on CNBC on Friday, in reference to the early November rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting.</p><p>U.S. Economy</p><p>Supply-Chain Bottlenecks, Elevated Inflation to Last Well Into 2022</p><p>Uncomfortably high inflation will grip the U.S. economy well into next year, as constrained supply chains keep upward pressure on prices and, increasingly, curb output, according to economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Retail Sales Rise, Showing Resilient U.S. Consumers</p><p>Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.7% in September from August, the Commerce Department said, as households shrugged off supply constraints, the Delta variant and the end of enhanced unemployment benefits.</p><p>Unions Push Companies as Workers Stay Scarce</p><p>Union leaders are pressing to increase their ranks and secure gains for their members as workers demand more from their employers and companies struggle with labor shortages and snarled supply chains.</p><p>What's Driving America's Workers to Leave Jobs in Record Numbers</p><p>In August, a seasonally adjusted 4.3 million resignations were handed in, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Though August is a traditionally high turnover month, in part because many teens and 20-somethings leave jobs to go back to school, the figure sets a record since the BLS started tracking it in 2000.</p><p>Largest Cities Had Some of the Lowest U.S. Inflation in September</p><p>While prices in the U.S. rose across the board for the year ended last month, the degree of change varied among different geographic regions and populations.

As Indonesia's economy is showing early signs of recovery, the pressure for more monetary policy support seems to be easing, ANZ says. Indonesia's economy is likely to continue improving as the government gradually eases coronavirus-related curbs and as commodity prices rise, the bank adds. ANZ expects Bank Indonesia to keep its policy rate unchanged for the rest of the year and to gradually raise rates in late 2022. The central bank's decision is due on Tuesday.

Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected a 73.0 reading.

(DJN)</p><p>Prices of goods imported to the U.S. rose 0.4% on month in September following a 0.3% drop in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.

On an annual basis, prices for U.S. imports increased 9.2%, compared with an 8.9% rise in August. (DJN)</p><p>The median U.S. home sale price rose 14% year-over-year to $376,800 in September, the lowest growth rate since December 2020, according a Redfin report.
