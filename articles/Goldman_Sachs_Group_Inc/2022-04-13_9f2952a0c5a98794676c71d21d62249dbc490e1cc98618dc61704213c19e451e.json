  "title": "Stocks Gain as Earnings Season Kicks Off; JPMorgan Chase, Delta Air Lines reported quarterly results Wednesday; Nasdaq up more than 2%",
  "text": "<p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.697% from 2.724% on Tuesday, extending its decline into a second day. Yields fall when prices rise.</p><p>Airline stocks jumped after Delta Air Lines reported a quarterly loss but said it returned to profitability in March and expects to report a second-quarter profit. The Atlanta-based company's stock price rose 6% while shares of American Airlines gained almost 10%, on track for their largest single-day increase since November 2020. Southwest Airlines added 6.8% and United Airlines Holdings rose 5.9%.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase shares declined about 4.2% after it posted a 42% decline in first-quarter profit, dragged down by higher expenses and lower fees from the bank's Wall Street arm. The earnings of America's largest bank often serve as a bellwether for the broader economy and canshine a light on the financial health of U.S. consumers.</p><p>Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are set to report earnings on Thursday. While most of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors rose Wednesday, financials—down about 0.2%—and utilities were in the red.</p><p>Investors are watching first-quarter earnings to assess the impact of record inflation on companies from auto manufacturers to energy providers.</p><p>\"When you look at it from a sector perspective, the sectors that are able to pass some of those price increases on to consumers, are the ones that have held up better this year,\" said Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. \"That's a trend we expect to continue, at least in the near term.\"</p><p>Stocks have come under pressure in recent days as concerns about inflation drove uncertainty about how aggressively the Federal Reserve could act to temper it. Data released Tuesday showed that consumer prices climbed further in March, rising 8.5% from a year earlier. The monthly increase was in line with economists' expectations and core inflation—which excludes food and energy—was slightly lower than predicted, according to Deutsche Bank.</p><p>\"The inflation data was obviously not great, but maybe we're around the peak and we'll start to see something of a disinflationary trend over the coming months,\" said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank. \"With bank earnings kicking off, we can get some direction. It's really going to be about the guidance that we get for the rest of the year.\"</p><p>The U.S. producer-price index, another gauge of inflation, rose by 11.2% in March compared with a year ago, the Labor Department said Wednesday. The increase exceeded expectations and marked the largest gain since records began in 2010. The sharp rise indicates that disruptions to key supply chains continue to drive up prices.</p><p>Volatile energy and commodity prices caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, coupled with Covid-19 lockdowns in parts of China that could lead to additional disruptions, are also boosting the cost of doing business for producers.</p><p>Oil prices rose, with global benchmark Brent crude adding 3.2% to trade at $107.96 a barrel. Traders are assessing energy demand in China, as some lockdown measures in Shanghai eased but more factories in the region, including two run by Apple suppliers, halted production.</p><p>Further disruptions to energy supplies are expected, according to the International Energy Agency. It said on Wednesday that oil output from Russia was likely to fall by nearly 3 million barrels a day starting in May, a bigger decline than other analysts had predicted.</p><p>Pharmaceutical company Antares Pharma surged 49% after The Wall Street Journal reported that Halozyme Therapeutics was nearing a deal to buy it for around $960 million. Shares of Gap Inc. added 9.9%, helping push the S&amp;P's consumer discretionary sector to a 1% gain. Marriott International Inc. gained 7.2%.</p><p>The U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against a basket of others, rose for the 10th straight session, on pace for its highest close since May 2020.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 finished the day up less than 0.1%. Germany's DAX index closed down 0.3%, its third consecutive daily loss.</p><p>Yields on the German 10-year bond pared earlier gains to trade around 0.776%. The European Central Bank is meeting Thursday and investors are awaiting more clarity on plans to curb stimulus measures.</p><p>\"ECB speakers have turned a little bit more hawkish lately,\" said Jeremy Gatto, a multiasset investment manager at Unigestion. \"They seem now to be agreeing that inflation might be a concern. It's difficult to get excited about Europe.\"</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that peace talks had reached a dead end and that his forces would continue their offensive in Ukraine.</p><p>In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ticked up 0.3%.</p><p>Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 1.9%. The yen depreciated 0.4% against the dollar, reaching a 20-year low. The Bank of Japan's governor reiterated on Wednesday that monetary policy will remain easy.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Orla McCaffrey at orla.mccaffrey@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Gain as Earnings Season Kicks Off</p>",
