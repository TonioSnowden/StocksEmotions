  "title": "Stock Futures Rally Ahead of Major Earnings; The S&P 500 is poised for a second day of strong gains ahead of reports from Goldman Sachs, Netflix and Lockheed Martin",
  "text": "<p>Investors had been bracing for a difficult earnings season, with the threats of soaring inflation, rising interest rates and flagging growth weighing on consumer spending and corporate profits. But results thus far have proved better than expected, prompting a rally for U.S. stock markets after months of declines.</p><p>\"Earnings are yet to crack. Consumers seem surprisingly resilient and it feels like companies are kind of keeping their heads above water,\" said Altaf Kassam, head of investment strategy for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at State Street Global Advisors. \"Earnings season hasn't been the collapse that people have been worried about.\"</p><p>Investors will get more glimpses later in the day of how companies are faring with a batch of major earnings reports due from the likes of Netflix, Goldman Sachs, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Lockheed Martin.</p><p>Global markets have also gotten a boost after the U.K. government walked back an unpopular package of tax cuts and government borrowing that had raised concerns about the U.K.'s debt burden and prompted the Bank of England to intervene to stabilize bond markets.</p><p>In commodity markets, oil prices inched lower with Brent crude, the international benchmark, declining 0.3% to $91.35 a barrel. Gold prices declined 0.5% to $1,661.40 a troy ounce.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.027% from 4.012% on Monday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. The ICE Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of other currencies, rose 0.2%.</p><p>Investors say this week's positive moves in stock markets are more evidence of the volatility that has characterized the market's erratic move lower this year and likely not the start of a turnaround. \"Interest rates are going to have to keep rising and central banks are still focused on inflation. The headwinds are still very much there,\" Mr. Kassam said.</p><p>Data on U.S. industrial production are also set to be released later in the day and are expected to register a modest increase in manufacturing activity in September after industrial output decreased 0.2% in August. The National Association of Home Builders will release its October housing-market index later in the morning.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.4%, led by auto makers.</p><p>In Asia, stock markets mostly closed higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 1.4% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 1.8%. In China, the Shanghai Composite Index edged down 0.1%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Rally Ahead of Major Earnings</p>",
