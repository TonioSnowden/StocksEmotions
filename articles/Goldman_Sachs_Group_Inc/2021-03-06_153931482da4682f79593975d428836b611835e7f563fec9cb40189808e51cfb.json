  "title": "REVIEW --- Icons: Art Big Enough to Get Lost In --- Artist Julie Mehretu uses architectural drawings and photographs to create abstract paintings on a grand scale.",
  "text": "<p>Starting March 25, Ms. Mehretu's paintings, drawings and prints will be on view in a midcareer retrospective at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art, before moving to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. The show includes one of her best-known paintings, \"Retopistics: A Renegade Excavation,\" which at nearly 20 feet wide was Ms. Mehretu's largest painting when she made it in 2001. The multilayered work reflects on the transitory nature of a global existence, with an initial layer of architectural drawings of airports around the world almost obscured by painted motifs, drips, lines and colorful streamers, in a precise yet cartoon-like dynamic.</p><p>Ms. Mehretu says that she wanted people \"to not see the edges and get lost in the minutiae of the drawing and then be able to move back to see the whole picture.\" As she explains, \"That's why my paintings became bigger, so you couldn't see both [aspects] at the same time.\" \"Retopistics,\" which is being lent to the Whitney by Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, fetched a record auction price for the artist in 2013 when it was sold by Christie's New York for $4.6 million.</p><p>As a child growing up in East Lansing, Mich., Ms. Mehretu often accompanied her father, a geography teacher, to the Detroit Institute of Arts Museum. It was there that she discovered Diego Rivera's 27-painting \"Detroit Industry Murals,\" depicting workers at the Ford Motor Company. The large-scale work is a touchstone: \"Seeing it again is always better than the memory of it,\" Ms. Mehretu says. \"Every time it's more than whatever I remembered it to be.\"</p><p>But Ms. Mehretu was never enchanted with the idea of becoming a figurative artist like Rivera. Abstraction provided her with a creative space to make sense of her place in the world as an Ethiopian-American who arrived in the U.S. at the age of six. \"It's in this complex, contradictory and rich mix of the two that I find myself,\" Ms. Mehretu says. \"It's one reason why abstraction has always been more interesting to me, because you can invent that in-between place and this other way of being rather than trying to call on just a particular set of cultural imagery and signifiers.\"</p><p>Ms. Mehretu is similarly interested in the hidden perspectives of architecture and city planning. The Whitney exhibition includes \"Mogamma (A Painting In Four Parts),\" a 2012 work whose title refers to the Egyptian government headquarters in Cairo's Tahrir Square, which protesters occupied in the Arab Spring revolt of 2011. The painting uses architectural drawings of the Mogamma to create a spidery abstract grid with occasional shards of color that maps the building's haphazard past. Built in the 1940s on a site formerly occupied by a British barracks, it began as a symbol of liberation from colonial occupation but later became a bastion of Egyptian bureaucracy.</p><p>Ms. Mehretu also considered accidents of location in the Goldman Sachs \"Mural,\" which embedded the geographical history of lower Manhattan's financial district. \"The site [in Battery Park] is next to an African American burial ground and also a Native American burial ground,\" Ms. Mehretu says. \"So the painting was conceived to explore that but also to be this organic thing inside of this space.\" Borrowing from the Situationists, Ms. Mehretu describes her earlier work as \"psychogeographies.\" \"In a way it was a type of self-ethnographic process,\" she says, \"where you tried to find yourself in the process of making marks and making paintings.\"</p><p>The exhibition's co-curator Rujeko Hockley believes that this need has become less urgent in Ms. Mehretu's later paintings, which have a much looser aesthetic. \"In the more recent paintings, instead of the underlayer being architectural drawings, thematic drawings or maps, she scans photographs from news agencies like AP or Reuters of current events in the world,\" Ms. Hockley says. \"She rotates them, she abstracts them, she blurs them, she manipulates them to the point where really the only thing you can see is the colors.\"</p><p>This is especially evident in a painting like \"Hineni\" (2018), whose title means \"here I am\" in Hebrew. The painting is a shimmering sweep of orange and black that overlays blurred photographs of California wildfires and burning villages in Myanmar. \"It's really important to Julie, this idea of being transparent and opaque at the same time,\" Ms. Hockley says. \"She gives people some of the tools to do the unpacking work, while trusting that they can do the rest of it by themselves.\"</p>",
