  "title": "Goldman grumbling grows for banking giant to sack CEO David Solomon",
  "text": "<p>Solomon, 60, took the job in 2018 and was always somewhat of an odd choice to run the white-shoe investment bank that usually cultivated its leaders from within. He cut his teeth at a decidedly un-Goldman-like venue: the scrappy investment bank Bear Stearns (ultimately one of the causalities of the 2008 financial crisis).</p><p>He joined Goldman GS in 1999, as a partner, no less, because his deal-making chops allowed him to skip layers of management.</p><p>In other words, Solomon is an outsider at a firm with a wickedly insular culture. He has a quirky side gig as a DJ in the summer Hamptons party circuit. He's also not one for small talk, and doesn't consult with a lot of people before handing down his edicts.</p><p>\"He doesn't breed a lot of love,\" said one former Goldman executive who knows Solomon well.</p><p>Lots of people at Goldman don't like him, and they're letting their views be heard both internally and with pals at rival firms.</p><p>For the record: I've met Solomon and like him for his no-BS style. And until pretty recently, the numbers show him doing a great job. Goldman was running on all cylinders in deals and trading. Even as the market corrects, shares are up about 60% since Solomon took over as CEO in 2018 compared to around a 44% rise in the S&amp;P during that time.</p><p>Goldman is still the top M&amp;A shop, even widening its market share over rivals in that important business line. Solomon was the first among his fellow CEOs to see the downturn and enact significant layoffs to cut costs.</p><p>Still, the grumbling about Solomon is spreading to the managing director and partner class. High-priced Wall Street talent don't call all the shots at any firm, of course. But Goldman's MDs and partners have historically been a powerful force when the board decides the fate of current management, which makes Solomon's hold on his job increasingly precarious as more and more of them defect from his camp.</p><p>Here's how they're building a case against him: Goldman's longtime archrival investment bank Morgan Stanley MS now easily dwarfs Goldman in market value, $144 billion to $116 billion, continuing a trend that predates Solomon. That comes amid a slowdown in banking deals, Goldman's bread-and-butter business, and Solomon's home turf.</p><p>Morgan's CEO James Gorman deftly expanded the firm's wealth management operations, which provide steady revenues. Solomon's effort to diversify was an overindulgence in something called Marcus, a digital retail bank launched by his predecessor Lloyd Bankfein that Solomon made his baby. So far, it's been a disaster, so much so that Solomon has been forced to scale back, possibly on the way to winding it down.</p><p>Goldman, meanwhile, has missed targets in its recent earnings announcements, and more downward surprises could be in store as markets continue to wobble. Bonuses are down, in some places cut in half, albeit from the nosebleed levels of 2021.</p><p>Traders did well in 2022 because Goldman's are particularly adept in profiting off turbulence, but part of their pool is being diverted to bankers to keep them in-house until the deal slowdown ends.</p><p>Since Solomon is a banker, he's also being accused of favoritism, which in truth is a pretty lame charge, since bankers often subsidize trader bonuses when the markets aren't profitable. Still, the Goldman trading department is powerful and can spark management change, as it has done in the past.</p><p>There's also a question about Solomon's allegiance to Goldman's stand-alone culture. In its 153-year existence, Goldman has operated on the assumption that it would be the acquirer in any major strategic acquisition. Solomon's experience at Bear, then one of the most transactional places on Wall Street, means he could be looking for a deal and not one that keeps Goldman in charge.</p><p>At a time when most Goldman insiders believe he needs to do a \"transformational deal,\" i.e., something big that allows it to better compete against Morgan Stanley and super banks like JP Morgan JPM, there is speculation that Solomon might allow Goldman to be swallowed whole by, say, a big asset manager or bank if the price was right.</p><p>As best I can tell, this grumbling, though real, doesn't immediately threaten Solomon's job. Then again, there is something to be said for keeping your producers happy.</p><p>Jack Welch, the legendary CEO of General Electric GE, was a notorious screamer and demanding beyond belief. Yet Welch knew how to nurture his people.</p><p>\"Jack could chew your ass, then put his arm around you and make you feel great,\" one of his longtime executives, Bob Nardelli, once told me.</p><p>It's why so many other talented execs chose to stay around under Welch, abuse and all, and left when his successor took over, watching GE implode from the outside.</p><p>Maybe it's a good time for Solomon to take a page from Welch and start hugging it out.</p><p>This article was first published on NYPost.com</p><p>Goldman grumbling grows for banking giant to sack CEO David Solomon</p>",
