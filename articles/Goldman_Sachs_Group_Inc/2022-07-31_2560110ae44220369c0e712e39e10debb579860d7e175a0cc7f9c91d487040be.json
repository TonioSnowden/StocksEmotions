  "title": "China's Economy Tested by Strained City Finances; Government entities could face a nearly $900 billion funding shortfall in 2022, weighing on Beijing's plans to revive growth",
  "text": "<p>Now the strains are getting worse. Cities must fund costly mass Covid testing programs imposed by Beijing to try to keep Covid-19 caseloads near zero. They are also being asked by Beijing to support stimulus meant to revive growth, including tens of billions of dollars' worth of railways and other infrastructure projects.</p><p>On top of all that, cities are being tasked with delivering unfinished housing projects across China, after numerous developers defaulted on debts amid a year-long slide in home sales.</p><p>Cities' burdens were underscored on Thursday, when China's Politburo, the Communist Party's top policy-making body, said that Beijing would keep enforcing its tough Covid-prevention policy while taking only cautious steps to support the struggling property market, with local governments taking direct responsibility for supporting housing demand.</p><p>Yet as demands on cities escalate, their revenues are shrinking. Land sales, which make up about 40% of local governments' revenues, have dried up as property development grinds to a halt.</p><p>Local governments are also collecting less in taxes, as Beijing offers more tax relief for private companies to promote growth. Such tax revenues are typically shared between Beijing and local governments, so when Beijing provides relief, cities feel some of the brunt.</p><p>In all, Chinese government entities face a shortfall of close to 6 trillion yuan ($889 billion) this year to cover fiscal spending plans, due to the sharp decline in land sales and the pandemic, economists from Nomura wrote in a report in May.</p><p>\"Local governments are financially stretched to an extent unseen in the past two decades,\" said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group.</p><p>No city has been pushed to the brink of default. The bigger near-term worry, some economists say, is that many local governments will have to cut back on services and funding for infrastructure projects while struggling to reinvigorate their property markets.</p><p>All that could further slow China's economy after it posted 0.4% growth in the second quarter compared with a year earlier.</p><p>\"The chance of a vicious cycle—declining housing sales and prices, mounting developers' distress, and deteriorating local government finances—developing is concerning from growth and financial stability perspectives,\" wrote Oxford Economics in a recent note to clients.</p><p>Up to one-third of Chinese local governments could have to take measures such as reducing spending by the end of this year, according to S&amp;P Global.</p><p>Some have already slashed income for civil servants. In July, a district in Shenzhen said it plans to cut 650 million yuan ($96 million) in spending on bonuses and subsidies for employees at government entities and state-owned organizations, while it redirects more than 600 million yuan to Covid testing and other Covid-related expenditures.</p><p>In Shanghai, the city's State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission in June called for donations from Communist Party members to \"support the fight against the Covid pandemic,\" according to a notice reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Government officials in Shenzhen and Shanghai didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Top officials in Beijing have said they are aware of cities' struggles. The central government in March earmarked a record 9.8 trillion yuan ($1.45 trillion) in transfer payments to local governments this year in part to help offset reduced tax revenue.</p><p>Authorities have also rolled out new lending quotas for Chinese banks to help cities pay for infrastructure, and they are moving forward 1.8 trillion yuan ($266 billion) in 2023 transfer payments to local governments this year, according to calculations by Goldman Sachs.</p><p>Beijing will strengthen monitoring of local governments' fiscal situation as they face \"relatively grave\" operating pressure, said Song Qichao, an official from China's finance ministry in July.</p><p>Yet economists say central government support so far falls short of what is needed.</p><p>Local governments in China have limited power to tax and raise funds directly. About 60% of most tax revenues goes to the central government, while local governments pocket the rest. Borrowing by local governments is restricted under an annual quota allocated by Beijing.</p><p>Over the past two decades, local governments have skirted official limits and amassed a huge volume of debt by borrowing through opaque channels, including special-purpose entities known as local government financing vehicles.</p><p>Collectively, local governments had the equivalent of more than $5 trillion in debt as of June, up 26% from a year earlier, according to data from China's Finance Ministry. Actual debt levels can be much higher, economists say, once off-budget channels like local government financing vehicles are considered.</p><p>Beijing has shown little appetite for allowing local governments to borrow more aggressively. Requests from some economically battered provinces including Hebei and Liaoning to raise debt limits were rejected by the ministry in July.</p><p>\"From the regulators' perspective, they don't want to undo yearslong efforts in reining in excessive debts,\" said Amanda Du, a senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service.</p><p>Local governments were able to cover some holes in their accounts in past years by cranking up land sales to developers in China's once-hot property market. Land sales plunged by around 30% during the first six months of this year from a year ago.</p><p>Adding to the pressure is Beijing's zero-Covid policy, which compels cities with Covid problems to institute mass testing.</p><p>In many cities, residents must show negative results from tests taken in the previous 48 or 72 hours to perform basic tasks such as shopping for groceries or taking public transportation.</p><p>If China tests residents every three days for the rest of the year in large cities, which cover about 30% of the total population, it could cost 706 billion yuan ($105 billion), according to calculations by economists from Goldman Sachs.</p><p>In China's central Henan province, where Covid cases have appeared this summer, plans to set up more than 14,000 testing booths and swab the province's roughly 98 million population every three days could cost at least 40 billion yuan ($6 billion) a year, according to calculations based on government procurement documents.</p><p>That means the cost of regular testing could amount to about 4% of Henan's general public budget expenditure last year, exceeding total spending on education in 2021.</p><p>Henan officials didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In late May, authorities in Sichuan province's Langzhong city asked residents to pay out of pocket for weekly mandatory Covid tests, in part because the government can't afford ongoing testing, according to the official People's Daily, which cited an unnamed official from the local health authority.</p><p>Langzhong officials didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Write to Wall Street Journal staff at editors@wsj.com</p><p>China's Economy Tested by Strained City Finances</p>",
