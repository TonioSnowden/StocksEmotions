  "text": "<p>There were also differences within the diverse-fund data set based on gender. While 90% of male-led firms closed a first-time fund, 77% of women-led firms did so.</p><p>More than a third of all diverse first-time fund managers didn't go on to raise a second fund, Mr. Vachhani said, adding some joined other firms or gave up on venture capital.</p><p>These are heady days for some venture firms. WSJ Pro reported that Lee Fixel's Addition, for example, is out raising its third fund, having already closed on two $1.3 billion funds since last year. That's par for the course in today's market where the big firms are getting bigger, and where smaller efforts by less-proven names are finding it difficult to gain attention from limited partners.</p><p>\"While not everyone is cut out to be a VC and many might underestimate the challenges, I do think the imbalance in success rates likely discourages some really talented diverse professionals from making a difference in the industry long term,\" Mr. Vachhani said.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Leveling the playing field. In today's frenetic housing market, buyers who take out mortgages are struggling to compete with those putting up all cash. Cash offers are more attractive because there is less chance the deal will fall through or be delayed due to financing issues. Now, a number of startups are offering programs to help level the playing field, The Wall Street Journal's Nicole Friedman reports.</p><p>Some of these companies front buyers the cash to buy their homes outright, while others buy houses directly on a buyer's behalf and then sell them to the buyer. The programs often target homeowners who need to buy a house before selling their current one.</p><p>Startups with cash-offer programs are expanding quickly. Companies like Ribbon, HomeLight Inc. and Orchard announced new funding rounds this month. Knock said this spring it is exploring plans to go public. Opendoor Technologies Inc., a house-flipping company that went public in late 2020, launched a cash-offer program in March. Real-estate brokerage Redfin Corp. is piloting a cash-offer program in some markets, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>86</p><p>The number of software companies that have gone public in the U.S. market so far this year, according to Dealogic, compared with 57 during all of 2020. (WSJ)</p><p>Freshworks Shouldn't Spoil on Delivery</p><p>Freshworks won't have the initial public offering world to itself this week, but the cloud-software company is appetizing enough to stand out in a crowded pack, WSJ's Dan Gallagher writes. Thirteen companies are slated to make their debuts this week, according to IPO Boutique. The largest of those will be Freshworks, which makes a suite of cloud-based software services aimed primarily at small and midsize businesses. The company will sell about $969 million worth of shares at the top end of its recently raised price range. That would land Freshworks a market value of around $9.7 billion.</p><p>Digital Freight Startup Transfix Going Public in SPAC Deal</p><p>Transfix Inc. plans to go public through a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company valuing the digital freight startup at $1.1 billion, the latest deal shaking up the middleman freight brokerage business, WSJ's Jennifer Smith reports. The blank-check merger with G Squared Ascend I Inc. would allow New York-based Transfix, which competes with bigger rivals including Uber Technologies Inc.'s Uber Freight business, to tap public markets for backing to expand its business of using technology to connect shippers with truckers and to expand development of additional services, such as transportation management software, company executives said.</p><p>Flying Taxi Startups Seek a Quiet Takeoff</p><p>If eVTOL aircraft companies are to achieve their commercial ambition of becoming flying taxis, then first they'll need to ensure their aircrafts are quiet enough to work in cities without disturbing residents. WSJ's George Downs looks into just how quiet these crafts need to be to take off.</p><p>Industry News</p><p>Funds</p><p>Blumberg Capital raised $225 million for its fifth fund to continue investing in big data and artificial intelligence. The San Francisco- and Tel Aviv-based firm recently participated in a $30 million funding round for cybersecurity platform Hunters. Blumberg Capital closed its fourth fund in 2017 with $206 million.</p><p>Fifth Wall, which invests in property technology, climate technology and retail, has raised more than $140 million toward its Climate Tech Fund. Investors in the vehicle, which has a $500 million target, to date include Equity Residential, Hudson Pacific Properties, Invitation Homes, Ivanhoé Cambridge and Kimco Realty Corp.
