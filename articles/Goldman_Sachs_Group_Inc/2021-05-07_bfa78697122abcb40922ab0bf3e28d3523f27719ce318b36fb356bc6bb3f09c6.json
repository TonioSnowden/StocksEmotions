Investment officers typically only ventured as far as public markets, aiming to play it safe with stocks and bonds.</p> <p>But over the past three decades that has all changed. You can now find endowments in every corner of finance, including esoteric strategies such as private equity, hedge funds, venture capital <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a6d0864-eb26-4e54-8ab5-ffad2e8166ee\">and even Spacs</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>In many ways, that is because of one man: <strong>David Swensen</strong>. The investment profession is mourning the loss of <strong>Yale University</strong>'s endowment chief, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/754d3e58-2eb4-49ae-b2a8-1721d2cfa667\">who has died from cancer</a> this week at the age of 67.&#xa0;</p> <p>Swensen, who took over the investment office of his alma mater in 1985, is a legendary figure at Yale.&#xa0;</p> <p>It isn't difficult to see why. He turned the New Haven-based university into one of wealthiest in the US, growing its assets from $1bn to $31bn during his 35-year tenure.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>But Swensen's influence extends far beyond the Yale campus. He is ranked alongside investing titans such as <strong>Warren Buffett</strong>, and is widely credited with reshaping how institutional investors allocate their cash.</p> <p>“The really great painters are the ones that change how other people paint, like Picasso,” said <strong>Charles Ellis</strong>, the former chair of Yale's endowment. “David Swensen changed how everyone who is serious about investing thinks about investing,”&#xa0;</p> <p>Fresh from stints on Wall Street at <strong>Salomon Brothers</strong> and <strong>Lehman Brothers</strong>, Swensen created what has now come to be known as the “Yale model”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Before Swensen, dividing your cash between stocks and bonds was considered diversification while a few nascent strategies acted as a sideshow.&#xa0;</p> <p>Swensen <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f954e90-15cb-11dc-a7ce-000b5df10621\">turned these alternative strategies into the main act</a>. He argued that institutions with long-term outlooks, such as universities that have been around for centuries, should put their cash in long-term investments rather than pay up for liquidity.&#xa0;</p> <p>It was a controversial view at the time but has since become the linchpin of institutional investing. Other university endowments quickly followed suit, many of which are now led by Swensen's protégés, and pension funds also took his lead.&#xa0;</p> <p>While Swensen's approach helped to drive billions of dollars of investment into private equity and hedge funds, transforming their founders into the “masters of the universe”, it wasn't always smooth sailing.&#xa0;</p> <p>The 2008 financial crisis tested Swensen's model, with the Yale endowment losing more than $5bn. More recently, endowments have drawn criticism as features of elite universities that already cater to society's most privileged.&#xa0;</p> <p>Still, Swensen was unwavering in his love for Yale and his work. “I love it! I love it!,” he said in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd91a3ec-b461-11de-bec8-00144feab49a\">Lunch with the FT</a> in 2009. “I was talking to somebody the other day who characterised endowment investing as the purest form of investing . . . I think that notion underpins why it is that I, or one of the reasons why I love my job as much as I do.”</p> <h2>Tata Steel gets a bold request from Sanjeev Gupta's empire</h2> <p>In the world of corporate finance, there's a place for chutzpah from time to time.&#xa0;</p> <p>But the sheer audacity that newly-public court documents reveal about the actions of<strong> V Ashok</strong>, the chief financial officer of <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong>'s <strong>GFG Alliance</strong>, is something else.&#xa0;</p> <p>Here's the backdrop. In May last year, as the pandemic swept the world, Gupta's <strong>Liberty Speciality Steels</strong> missed a £12.5m payment to <strong>Tata Steel</strong>, the third in a series of instalments it owed for acquiring some of Tata's South Yorkshire steel businesses in the UK in 2017, according to Tata's court filings. (Catch up on that purchase <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1bfe710a-eeca-11e6-930f-061b01e23655\">here</a>.)&#xa0;</p> <p>By July <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>, Gupta's main lender, had started making UK taxpayer-backed loans to the tycoon's loose collection of linked companies, providing a vital liquidity injection.&#xa0;</p> <p>In August Gupta <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d5956d2-33e0-4ab0-a6d9-76cf63929bd9\">splashed out on</a> a £42m house in Belgravia, where he would count the Russian oligarch <strong>Oleg Deripaska</strong> as a neighbour.&#xa0;</p> <p>But the £12.5m had still not been paid, according to the documents filed by Tata. Instead, Gupta's company had made three ad hoc £1m payments in July.&#xa0;</p> <p>The month of Gupta's house purchase, Ashok had a request for <strong>Kaushik De</strong>, finance director at Tata Steel Europe, which had started charging interest on the unpaid bill.&#xa0;</p> <p>In an email on August 18 he asked for “support and understanding” and said his company aimed to “settle all outstanding amounts” as soon as funding had been “realised”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Then he added: “We would also request your kind consent to waive off all interest claims on the outstanding amounts.” If it had worked, it would've been a masterstroke.&#xa0;</p> <p>It didn't, of course. Gupta's company made two further ad hoc payments, this time of £1.5m each, in September and October — but never paid the full balance. Over the course of the year it cited the pandemic, and later Greensill's collapse, as the reasons for the difficulties.&#xa0;</p> <p>So Tata is suing for the remainder, plus interest. Gupta's company owes another £10m, the fourth interim payment, this month, and Tata said in the filings, dated last month, that it would add that to the lawsuit if it was not paid. Gupta's group still has time to file a response to the legal claim.&#xa0;</p> <p>Catch up on the court case in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b77bb81d-7213-437b-862a-9d10cd8657b6\">this story</a> by DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Sylvia Pfeifer.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Still, at least one company appears willing to still lend to Gupta.&#xa0;</p> <p>White Oak, a US-based private finance group, has agreed terms on a £200m loan for his British steelworks, Sylvia reported on Thursday. White Oak has also stepped in to refinance Gupta's Australian steel assets and associated mines.
