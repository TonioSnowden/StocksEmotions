  "title": "Natural-Gas Prices Swing in Volatile Trading After Fire in Texas and New Inventory Data; After falling Wednesday, prices were buoyed by data showing little progress has been made to boost domestic gas inventories",
  "text": "<p>Freeport LNG said its facility on Quintana Island, Texas would be shut down for at least three weeks following the fire that broke out midday Wednesday. The closely held firm, which is one of the country's largest gas exporters, said there were no injuries, all employees have been accounted for and that there is no risk to residents of the barrier island south of Houston.</p><p>When the facility is operating at full capacity, it consumes about 2 billion cubic feet of gas a day, or about 2% of total U.S. production. That is enough gas to generate a full year's worth of electricity for roughly 50,000 U.S. homes.</p><p>The longer that it is idled, or operating below capacity, the more gas will be available to domestic buyers, such as utilities and manufacturers, and for traders to sock away in storage facilities until winter, when demand and prices usually peak as people burn the fuel for heat. In Europe, the prospect of extended downtime at a key supplier pushed prices higher.</p><p>Natural-gas stockpiles around the world have been drained by weather events last year and consumption that has outpaced production since economies emerged from pandemic lockdowns. Booming demand overseas for LNG, especially in Europe following the invasion of Ukraine, has helped keep domestic reserves low.</p><p>U.S. natural-gas inventories are nearly 15% below the five-year average for this time of year, the EIA said Thursday. Freeport's downtime will make more gas available to traders to stash away, but the extra gas is unlikely to make much of a dent in the storage deficit unless the outage extends well beyond Freeport's initial timeline, analysts said.</p><p>\"Whether or not the selloff will prove overdone or undercooked will depend on the duration of which the facility is down in excess of the three week period,\" said Matt Murphy, analyst at energy investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt &amp; Co.</p><p>Natural-gas futures for July delivery ended up 3% Thursday, at $8.963 per million British thermal units, on a day in which prices had been as low as $8.016. Despite the bounce back, futures remain 6.6% below the $9.60 at which they traded on Wednesday, before the fire in Texas. That was the highest price since 2008 and more than triple the price a year earlier.</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Samantha Dart told clients in a note that if the outage lasts less than a month, the effect on U.S. inventories would likely be offset by high demand from power plants. Above-average temperatures are expected to have Americans cranking up their air conditioners later this month, and utilities don't have much of an alternative to gas given their meager coal stockpiles, she said.</p><p>Though the shutdown offers some reprieve to U.S. buyers, it further strains supplies in Europe and Asia, which increasingly depend on cargoes of liquefied shale gas.</p><p>In Europe, where buyers have been racing to replace fuel from Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, the expected downtime at a key supplier lifted prices. The benchmark price for Western Europe, set at a Dutch trading hub, ended Thursday 6.9% higher.</p><p>â€”Dan Molinski contributed to this article.</p><p>Natural-Gas Prices Swing in Volatile Trading After Fire in Texas and New Inventory Data</p>",
