  "title": "L Catterton Hires Goldman, Morgan Stanley for Possible Summer IPO; Bernard Arnault-backed private-equity firm could be valued at $3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter",
  "text": "<p>The firm, which is backed by LVMH MoÃ«t Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE's billionaire chairman, Bernard Arnault, could fetch a valuation of $3 billion or more, the people said.</p><p>As always, the plans are subject to change based on market conditions or other factors.</p><p>Reuters reported in July that L Catterton was evaluating options including a public listing or special-purpose acquisition company deal.</p><p>Greenwich, Conn.-based L Catterton manages roughly $30 billion, and its portfolio includes a swath of well-known consumer companies. Among them: German shoe manufacturer Birkenstock GmbH and children's-apparel maker Hanna Andersson. In 2020, it sold Cholula for around $800 million at a sizable profit after owning the hot-sauce company for less than two years.</p><p>Low interest rates have encouraged investors to pour money into private-equity funds in search of higher returns. Firms are now sitting on billions of dollars just as many publicly traded companies' stock prices are falling sharply. Private-equity firms have also developed new ways to bolster and highlight their management fees, which are prized by public investors for their steadiness.</p><p>TPG Inc. went public earlier this year at a roughly $9 billion valuation; after initially rising, the stock is back to trading around its $29.50 IPO price.</p><p>So far in 2022, the IPO market has been quiet following a record 2021. A volatile stock market, poor performance from last year's class of IPOs and rising interest rates have deterred companies from launching offerings, according to bankers and company executives. IPO volumes are down roughly 87% so far this year in the U.S., according to Dealogic.</p><p>L Catterton was born in 2016, when private-equity firm Catterton partnered with LVMH and Groupe Arnault. It has 17 offices around the world, and in addition to its flagship fund, also has ones devoted to growth companies, Latin America, Europe, Asia and real estate.</p><p>Write to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com and Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com</p><p>L Catterton Hires Goldman, Morgan Stanley for Possible Summer IPO</p>",
