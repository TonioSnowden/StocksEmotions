  "title": "Job Market Appears Healthy Despite Omicron Headwinds; Economists estimate new jobless claims fell last week, signaling fewer layoffs",
  "text": "<p>After declining through most of 2021, the number of new claims reached the lowest point in five decades by December. More recently claims moved higher as the Omicron variant began to ratchet up the number of Covid-19 cases throughout the country, causing some workers to call in sick, businesses to shut down temporarily and schools to pivot to online learning.</p><p>The number of new claims in mid-January rose to its highest level since October. Some economists attributed the increase to volatility in the data while others saw it as a consequence of the Omicron variant. Claims are well down from a year ago, when more than 800,000 applications were filed a week.</p><p>\"Employers are still doing a lot to try to keep workers on staff because they know it's hard to hire right now,\" said Aaron Sojourner, an economist at the University of Minnesota. He described workers unexpectedly missing work because of Covid-19 as the biggest consequence of the surge in cases.</p><p>Job openings, quits and hires were at or near record highs in November, indicating a tight labor market with a lot of churn. Mr. Sojourner said that the Omicron variant has likely slowed the labor market's recovery, but he expects it to quickly resume once the current surge of Covid-19 cases passes.</p><p>The recent increase was likely due to workers filing for unemployment benefits because they got sick, said David Mericle, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs's Global Investment Research. In certain instances, workers are able to apply for unemployment benefits if they are on unpaid sick leave, even if they don't separate from their employer.</p><p>\"With labor demand so strong, I'm doubtful that many of these people are really losing their jobs,\" Mr. Mericle said. \"And even if they areâ€¦they presumably are able to find new ones pretty easily.\"</p><p>Write to Bryan Mena at bryan.mena@wsj.com</p><p>Job Market Appears Healthy Despite Omicron Headwinds</p>",
