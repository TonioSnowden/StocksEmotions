  "text": "<p>Bridgewater Associates has appointed two co-chief executives to replace David McCormick, who is leaving the world's largest hedge fund for an expected run for the US Senate. </p> <p>The firm said it was promoting Nir Bar Dea, previously deputy chief executive, to share the top job with Mark Bertolini, co-chair of Bridgewater's operating board of directors and a former healthcare executive. At 65, Bertolini is 25 years older than his co-chief executive. </p> <p>A statement signed by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/523c210c-e064-43d8-a084-44d821e776b0\">Ray Dalio</a>, the fund's billionaire founder, said McCormick was leaving to explore a run “for the open Senate seat in his home state of Pennsylvania”.</p> <p>McCormick, whose wife Dina Powell McCormick is an executive at Goldman Sachs and a former member of the Trump administration, was the last of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a93b1d08-1824-11ea-9ee4-11f260415385\">number of executives</a> recruited by Dalio and Bridgewater to transform it from a founder-led firm to a more durable business.</p> <p>At Bridgewater, Dalio and his two co-chief investment officers, Bob Prince and Greg Jensen, invest the fund's roughly $150bn of assets while the chief executive manages the day-to-day running of the firm. </p> <p>Bridgewater said the “co-CEO model” would give it “a powerful combination of Nir, a well-respected internal leader . . . and Mark, who has enormous experience”. </p> <p>Bar Dea, who joined Bridgewater in 2015, was previously an adviser to the Israeli mission to the UN and a platoon leader in the Israeli military. </p> <p>Bertolini, who survived a serious skiing accident in 2004, is a veteran of the US healthcare industry and was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b336e872-e002-11e5-b072-006d8d362ba3\">chief executive of health insurer Aetna</a> for eight years before it was sold to CVS. But he has relatively little experience with hedge funds. </p> <p>Bridgewater is known for its idiosyncratic culture of “radical truth and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/789399f0-cf62-11e5-831d-09f7778e7377\">radical transparency</a>” and of fostering fierce debate that has led to high staff turnover as well as long meetings. </p> <p>McCormick, a former senior US Treasury official responsible for international economic relations under George W Bush, joined Bridgewater in 2009, becoming co-chief executive in 2017 and sole chief executive last year.</p> <p>He has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f356024e-c6cb-4cbe-b381-3218f9f9c367\">preparing to join</a> the Republican primary field for the Senate seat in Pennsylvania being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce8bbf68-3d34-41df-ba96-f6fe94eecec7\">vacated by Pat Toomey</a>. The contest in this year's midterm elections could be pivotal in determining the balance of power in the Senate, which is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans. </p> <p>In challenging the Republican primary field, McCormick would face Mehmet Oz, the television celebrity physician known as “Dr Oz”, who is a leading contender for his party's nomination. </p> <p>But McCormick is hoping that Republicans in the state will prefer a more mainstream, business-friendly candidate in the mould of Glenn Youngkin, the former Carlyle executive who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5234787f-cffd-407a-9d50-9c096b7c329d\">won the Virginia governor's race</a> as a Republican in November.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York and James Politi in Bolzano, Italy 2022 'Bridgewater appoints co-CEOs as top executive quits for US Senate run' FT.com 3 January.
