Industry observers are paying particular attention to Credit Suisse, which was put on a watchlist of institutions requiring tougher supervision by the UK financial regulator, the Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/442f0e26-05c7-4464-8b85-52af3f14199e\">reported</a> this month.</p> <p>The results of the US test, which is a requirement of the post-crisis Dodd-Frank financial regulations, are due on June 23.</p> <p>The exercise will determine the so-called stress-test capital buffer for the largest US banks — the amount of high-quality common equity tier one capital, or CET1, they will have to hold relative to their risk-weighted assets in excess of regulatory minimums. This CET1 ratio is a crucial benchmark of financial stability.</p> <p><br><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.
