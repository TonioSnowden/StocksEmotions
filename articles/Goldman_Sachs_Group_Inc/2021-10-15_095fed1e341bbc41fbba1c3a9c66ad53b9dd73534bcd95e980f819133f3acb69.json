  "title": "Stocks Rise After More Strong Earnings Reports; Dow, S&P 500 climb higher as oil prices extend run-up",
  "text": "<p>For the week, the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.6% and the Dow is up 1.3%, on track for their best showing since July and June respectively.</p><p>Solid quarterly results from healthcare companies and banks including Morgan Stanley and Citigroup has buoyed the market in recent days. Of the 35 companies on the S&amp;P 500 that had reported earnings through Thursday, 80% have beaten analysts' forecasts, according to FactSet, slightly better than the three-quarters that did so each quarter in 2019, before the pandemic.</p><p>Economic data have also helped reassure investors about the growth outlook. Data Friday showed retail sales unexpectedly rose in September, despite economists' worries about the Delta variant of the Covid-19 virus and the end of enhanced unemployment benefits.</p><p>Bank stocks helped lead the market higher Friday.</p><p>Shares of Goldman Sachs Group jumped 2.4% after the firm reported earnings of $5.38 billion in the third quarter, up 60% from the comparable period of 2020 and surpassing expectations from analysts.</p><p>Meanwhile, logistics company J.B. Hunt Transport Services rose 9.6% after reporting a rise in third-quarter profits.</p><p>Shares of Alcoa climbed 14% after the metals producer posted higher third-quarter sales Thursday, boosted by higher aluminum prices.</p><p>Moderna rose 0.7% after experts advising the Food and Drug Administration voted late Thursday to recommend authorizing a booster shot of the firm's Covid-19 vaccine.</p><p>While earnings this season have largely impressed investors so far, many say they remain cautious about the market's outlook, citing fears that supply-chain blockages and a steep rise in energy prices will fuel more inflationary pressures. That in turn could push central banks to withdraw stimulus at a faster pace than currently forecasted.</p><p>Data Wednesday showed a gauge of consumer prices rose more than expected in September. Meanwhile, energy markets extended a run-up Friday that has pushed oil and gas prices to multiyear highs and strained already snarled supply chains. Brent-crude futures, the benchmark in global oil markets, rose 0.9% to $84.74 a barrel, having earlier hit their highest intraday level in three years.</p><p>In the bond market, yields on 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.571% Friday, from 1.519% Thursday. Yields rise when bond prices fall.</p><p>Friday's uptick in yields was in line with upbeat moves in stocks and commodities, though correlations between different markets are in flux as investors debate the inflation outlook, according to Richard McGuire, head of rates strategy at Rabobank.</p><p>\"We've seen an ebb and flow this week,\" he said. Mr. McGuire expects the inflation burst to fade, as \"high prices will sow the seed of their own downfall,\" with consumers starting to spend less.</p><p>Overseas markets were broadly higher.</p><p>The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.7%, led by shares of energy producers and travel-and-leisure companies, which tend to be sensitive to the path of economic growth.</p><p>Shares of airlines including Ryanair and Wizz Air rose after the U.K. government said travelers returning to England from most countries would be able to take quick-fire coronavirus tests starting later this month. Currently, rules require a more expensive test.</p><p>In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 1.8%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.5% and China's Shanghai Composite Index edged up 0.4%.</p><p>Turkey's lira fell 0.3% against the U.S. dollar. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fired three top central-bank officials this week, adding to pressure on the currency, which has tumbled almost 20% this year. The central bank cut its key interest rate in September, even as the annual pace of inflation hit almost 20%, raising concerns among investors that prices will keep rising at a rapid rate.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com and Akane Otani at akane.otani@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Rise After More Strong Earnings Reports</p>",
