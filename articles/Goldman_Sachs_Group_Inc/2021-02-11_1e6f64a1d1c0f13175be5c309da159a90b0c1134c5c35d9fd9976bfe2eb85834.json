  "text": "<p>    Joe Biden, who sought the Democratic nomination as keeper of Barack Obama's legacy, is now surrounded by Democratic activists deeply ambivalent about that legacy. </p><p>    Affordable Care Act? Left the insurance companies in charge. The $831 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009? Too small and too timid. The Dodd-Frank financial overhaul? Not tough enough on big banks. The progressive message to Mr. Biden: Don't make that mistake again. </p><p>   That tension is at the heart of a fight over who should run the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, regulator of most of the biggest U.S. banks. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Mr. Biden is considering nominating University of Michigan public policy professor Michael Barr. </p><p>   Activists on the left are trying to derail that nomination. With Mr. Biden prioritizing diversity, they are pushing Mehrsa Baradaran, a University of California, Irvine law professor who has written on the racial wealth gap and is an immigrant from Iran. She has the support of Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown, an advocate of breaking up the biggest banks. </p><p>   They are also attacking Mr. Barr's record as too friendly to financial companies when he negotiated the Dodd-Frank law while serving in Mr. Obama's Treasury Department, and since. In fact, their complaints about Mr. Barr are a proxy for a broader indictment: that Mr. Obama missed a chance to fundamentally remake the financial system along more populist lines. </p><p>   But this relies on a selective reading of history that misjudges the complexity of the financial system and the challenges facing those who oversee it. </p><p>   Mr. Barr came to the Obama administration with solidly progressive credentials, having written extensively on how to improve the treatment of poor people in the financial system. As Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's point person on financial reform, Mr. Barr pushed through the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, earning praise from then-Harvard law professor and now senator Elizabeth Warren, and the antagonism of lenders. </p><p>   Mr. Barr also oversaw programs aimed at protecting homeowners from foreclosure, which fell well short of their goals. One reason was that Treasury officials, concerned about a backlash if undeserving borrowers were bailed out, made qualification too difficult. But the bigger problems were structural: Mortgages were scattered among mortgage-backed securities, and modifying them involved servicers, investors, holders of junior liens, and trustees who lacked the capacity or incentive. </p><p>   Mr. Barr also riled some fellow Democrats over how to regulate big banks. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker had proposed limits on banks' trading with their own money. Mr. Geithner was lukewarm, believing proprietary trading was hard to distinguish from other trading and had nothing to with the crisis, but he included it in the draft law. Two Democratic senators proposed a much more sweeping \"Volcker rule\" that would cover a broader range of companies. Mr. Barr worried their version would end up riddled with loopholes while losing the votes of moderate senators needed to pass the law. </p><p>   Another Democratic senator proposed banning banks from trading derivatives. Mr. Barr, like most experts, thought that would make the financial system more unstable by weakening banks' ability to manage risk while pushing derivatives into less regulated places. Modified versions of both the Volcker and derivatives rules ended up in Dodd-Frank, and both have been diluted since. </p><p>   Since leaving the Treasury, Mr. Barr has continued to write and advocate for consumer protection and inclusion. He has also been a paid consultant to digital-currency platform Ripple Labs Inc. and online lender LendingClub Corp. Those gigs are another target of the left who complain about a \"revolving door\" between regulators and regulated. Yet Mr. Biden's nominee to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission, Gary Gensler, was a partner at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and his Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, earned lucrative speaking and consulting fees from financial companies. </p><p>   Arguably, Mr. Biden should be worried more by the absence of deeper experience with Wall Street on his team. He will no doubt want the next comptroller to address climate change, digital currencies, financial technology and access by racial minorities and small businesses to credit, as underlined by the pandemic. But the core of the job is the safety and soundness of institutions whose total assets exceed $14 trillion. </p><p>   Getting that right requires an appreciation for financial complexity. Mr. Obama's team understood this well, which is why they saw populist demands to punish, break up and circumscribe banks as counterproductive, and instead focused on bulking up their capital against future losses and empowering regulators to safely liquidate any big financial company that got into trouble. The result was a less profitable but safer banking system that came through last year's pandemic turmoil unscathed. Not a legacy to be discarded lightly. </p><p></p>",
