  "text": "<p>   Alex Lasry might be swimming upstream as he seeks the U.S. Senate nomination in Wisconsin from a Democratic Party skeptical of Wall Street and worried about income inequality. </p><p>   The 33-year-old is a former Goldman Sachs analyst and son of Marc Lasry, a billionaire hedge-fund manager and co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team. </p><p>   The race, in a state decided by less than one percentage point in November's presidential election, will be among the most important nationally in 2022 for determining Senate control. Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, a strong ally of former President Donald Trump who once pledged to retire after two terms, hasn't yet indicated whether he'll seek a third. </p><p>   Mr. Lasry, a Wisconsin resident since 2014 who announced his candidacy Feb. 17, has triggered a rare moment of bipartisan agreement between national Republicans and some Wisconsin Democrats. </p><p>   The National Republican Senatorial Committee has labeled him a \"spoiled rich kid,\" while another announced Democratic candidate in the race, Tom Nelson, is saying similar things, albeit in a more polite, Midwestern tone. </p><p>   \"The notion of someone coming in and buying a U.S. Senate race, there's a visceral reaction to that and people are not going to stand for that,\" Mr. Nelson, the top elected official in Outagamie County, southwest of Green Bay, said in an interview. \"I'm going to be outspent by millions.\" </p><p>   Seeking to capitalize on Mr. Lasry's wealth, Mr. Nelson released an online video Feb. 23 where he offered to sell his children's toys and other household belongings to raise campaign cash. \"I don't have that kind of money, so I'm having this little garage sale,\" he said in the video. </p><p>   Mr. Lasry, in an interview, played down the relevance of his family's money. </p><p>   \"When I talk to voters, there's no talk about my wealth,\" he said. \"What people actually want to talk about is how are we going to raise wages for people, how are we actually going to create jobs and how are we going to work on issues like racial and social justice.\" </p><p>   Mr. Lasry, a Bucks senior vice president, pointed to a $15 minimum wage the team's business arm agreed to pay unionized food workers at its arena, as well as an effort to invest in minority-owned firms. </p><p>   His connections in Milwaukee helped Mr. Lasry secure early endorsements from several top city officials. His work leading fundraising efforts for the 2020 Democratic National Convention, awarded to Milwaukee but moved mostly online due to the pandemic, helped him expand his national network. </p><p>   Mr. Lasry's father was a top fundraiser for President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, raising more than $500,000. A photo of the younger Lasry with Mr. Obama during his time as a White House aide appeared in his announcement video. </p><p>   Both father and son were among the more than 800 individuals and couples who raised at least $100,000 for President Biden's 2020 campaign. </p><p>   Mr. Biden is unlikely to personally weigh in on a primary, but the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee sometimes does so. The Democratic field in Wisconsin, which will face off in an August 2022 primary, may still grow. </p><p>   Besides Mr. Lasry and Mr. Nelson, Gillian Battino has also filed federal paperwork to run. State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes have also expressed interest in the race, as has U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, among others. </p><p>   As he stressed the importance of grass-roots fundraising and organizing, Mr. Lasry said he has no plans to finance his own campaign. But he didn't rule out the possibility that he or family members might invest in the race. </p><p>   \"The Republicans are going to throw everything they can at this race,\" he said. \"We need to make sure that we're going to win this race and that we have the resources to compete.\" </p><p>   The state saw the first television advertisements of the 2022 campaign cycle in mid-January when the Democratic Party of Wisconsin launched more than $100,000 in spots critical of Mr. Johnson, who has questioned Mr. Biden's victory and whether the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol amounted to an armed insurrection. </p><p>   \"Ron Johnson is committed to delivering results for Wisconsin,\" said Ben Voelkel, a spokesman for the senator. \"New York liberal Alex Lasry is focused on using his family connections to line his pockets and jump the line to get a Covid vaccine.\" </p><p>   The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in late January that Mr. Lasry received a dose of coronavirus vaccine at a senior living center in Milwaukee, despite not being part of a group eligible for a shot. </p><p>   After the report, Mr. Lasry said on Twitter that he was vaccinated after his pregnant wife got a call from her uncle telling her that the facility had extra doses that were going to go to waste if they weren't used immediately. \"With Lauren early in her pregnancy, we wanted to ensure our home, and entire community is safe for everyone,\" he wrote. </p><p>   Mr. Lasry said he plans to release his tax returns and called on all candidates in the race to do the same. A financial disclosure form filed in August by Mr. Johnson, a businessman, listed assets worth between $18.1 million and $84.4 million. The forms allow for a broad range for each asset, so identifying a more precise figure is impossible. </p><p></p>",
