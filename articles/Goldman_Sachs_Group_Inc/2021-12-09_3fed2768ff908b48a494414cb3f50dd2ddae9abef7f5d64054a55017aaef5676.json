  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Digital Lender Nubank  To Start NYSE Trading  ----  By Vinod Sreeharsha",
  "text": "<p>   When David Velez tried to open an account in a Brazilian bank in 2012, it took him four months to win approval, not unusual in a country where high fees and bureaucracy are the norm in banking. When visiting the bank, he would leave his cellphone in a locker before passing through bulletproof doors as armed guards scrutinized him. </p><p>   \"You're going through all that experience to then pay 15%-a-month interest rates and pay hundreds of fees,\" he recounted at a CB Insights conference in New York in 2018. \"How is it possible you're doing that?\" </p><p>   The experience led to a kernel of an idea: There was room in Brazil, a country where five banks control nearly the entire market, for a new kind of bank. Nubank, the digital banking startup that the Colombian-born investor-turned-entrepreneur co-founded, is set to start trading this week on the New York Stock Exchange in one of the year's largest initial public offerings. </p><p>   From its beginnings in 2013 offering credit-card services, Nubank has expanded to serve 48 million customers, up from six million in 2018. Total revenue has topped $1 billion, nearly twice the $535 million last year. Nubank had been losing money until the first half of this year, when it posted a profit. </p><p>   The offering would be the fifth-largest IPO of the year in the U.S. based on the amount to be raised, according to Nicholas Einhorn, vice president of research at Renaissance Capital. If it prices at the high end, Nubank would raise about $2.6 billion and be valued at $41.5 billion, exceeding Brazil's largest traditional bank, Itau Unibanco SA. </p><p>   This even after Nu Holdings Ltd., the parent company, lowered its planned price range from $10-$11 a share to $8-$9, shaving off nearly $10 billion in valuation in an amended filing on Nov. 30 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trading under the NU ticker symbol, the company is offering 289.2 million shares. Investors participating in the offering include SoftBank Group Corp. and Tiger Global Management LLC. The underwriters are Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. </p><p>   Nubank, whose investors include Berkshire Hathaway Inc., said in its prospectus that it plans to use proceeds to fuel its growth in Brazil and in Colombia and Mexico, countries where it launched in 2020. And it is looking at other sectors it can disrupt, including healthcare and telecommunications, according to the prospectus. </p><p>   Demand for alternatives in the banking sector was pent up when Mr. Velez arrived in Brazil. At the same time, smartphone use was booming. Younger Brazilians were increasingly drawn to online services. And there was -- and still is -- a large underbanked population. </p><p>   Taking on traditional banking is a challenge. As recently as December 2018, the top five Brazilian banks accounted for 84% of deposits, according to the country's central bank, and the sector had among the world's highest net interest margins. Of 582 publicly listed companies in Latin America in the first half of 2020, the three most profitable were Brazilian banks, according to the Brazilian consulting firm Economatica. </p><p>   In a country with a history of hyperinflation and economic tumult, Brazilian banks had reason to be conservative. But Mr. Velez, who declined to talk to The Wall Street Journal ahead of the IPO but has spoken to the paper in the recent past, has said the caution was out of date. </p><p>   The 40-year-old Colombian, whose family left Medellin for Costa Rica during the reign of cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar, was an unlikely disrupter. He had studied engineering at Stanford University and was hired by Sequoia Capital to find investments in Brazil, moving there in 2012. </p><p>   After Sequoia quickly pulled the plug on the Brazilian operation, Mr. Velez opted to stay and found his own startup, even though he had never built a technology company. He partnered with Cristina Junqueira, a Brazilian who had been an executive at Itau Unibanco, and Edward Wible, an American computer scientist. </p><p>   Nubank's initial product was a catchy purple credit card. It then expanded to add a savings account, an investment platform, lending and insurance. Last year, it acquired an investment platform, Easynvest. </p><p>   During the pandemic, the company braced itself for a bank run. With a digital bank, all that would take is one click. </p><p>   \"The exact opposite happened,\" Mr. Velez told the paper in May. \"Beginning in April, we started seeing an avalanche of deposits going from the big banks into Nubank.\" </p><p>   Still, Covid-19 weighs heavily in Brazil, a country that has recorded more than 600,000 deaths from the pandemic, second only to the U.S. \"The pandemic is definitely a concern because ultimately, we need healthy customers, we need healthy countries,\" Mr. Velez said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Paulo Trevisani contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
