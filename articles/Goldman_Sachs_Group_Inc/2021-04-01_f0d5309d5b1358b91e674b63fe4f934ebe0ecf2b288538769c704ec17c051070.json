  "title": "Banking & Finance:  BlackRock Commits  To Secondary Deals  ----  By Chris Cumming",
  "text": "<p>    BlackRock Inc. has raised $3 billion to invest in the private-equity secondary market, as the world's largest asset manager seeks to expand its presence in illiquid alternative investments. </p><p>   BlackRock Secondaries &amp; Liquidity Solutions LP is among the largest debut funds ever raised to buy secondhand private-equity stakes. </p><p>   Secondary funds have been one of the fastest-growing parts of the private-equity industry over the past year, with investor demand surging even after the pandemic hit. Such funds raised $16.72 billion globally this year through late March, nearly keeping up the record pace of last year, when they collected $80.86 billion in total, according to data-tracking firm Preqin Ltd. </p><p>    Steve Lessar and Konnin Tam co-head BlackRock's secondaries and liquidity solutions group, which they helped launch in 2018 after holding senior positions at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p><p>    Veena Isaac, a former executive at investment firms Jasper Ridge Partners and Pantheon Ventures, joined the group as a managing director in 2019. </p><p>   BlackRock's secondary group aims to invest in midsize transactions, generally between $100 million and $200 million, across a range of deal structures and strategies, said Mr. Tam. \"We're not limiting ourselves to a particular part of the secondary market. We can pivot to wherever the attractive opportunities may be,\" he said. </p><p>   BlackRock Chief Executive Laurence Fink has in recent years pushed to expand his firm's scale in illiquid alternative assets such as private equity. The firm, with $8.68 trillion under management as of the end of last year, is best known for low-cost funds that track exchanges. </p><p>   BlackRock's $259 billion alternatives platform also is one of the world's largest, but it is tilted toward real estate, credit, infrastructure and hedge-fund investments, with a smaller presence in private equity. </p><p>   BlackRock Private Equity Partners managed about $26 billion as of the end of last year, the firm said. The Wall Street Journal reported the firm had lowered its fundraising goal for a private-equity fund that would buy long-term stakes in companies. Initially targeting $12 billion, the firm hopes to raise $4 billion to $6 billion for the vehicle, the Journal reported in January. </p><p>   BlackRock raised its first stand-alone secondary fund despite the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, which upended private-equity fundraising by limiting travel and in-person meetings. The firm added that the fund closed on its first portion of investor money last March and was able to invest through the market dislocations caused by the pandemic. </p><p>   The $3 billion pool consists of a $2.4 billion fund and about $600 million in additional capital from some of the fund's large backers to be invested in deals alongside the fund, said Mr. Tam. The final tally nearly doubled the $1.5 billion the firm initially sought to raise. </p><p>   BlackRock has so far made 15 deals from the new fund, said Mr. Tam. The group's investments so far have been divided fairly evenly between traditional secondaries -- in which a private-equity investor sells stakes in its holdings -- and the fast-growing field of general partner-led deals, according to Mr. Lessar. </p><p>   GP-led deals, which allow private-equity firms themselves to offer their investors the option of cashing out of one or more assets in a fund or reinvesting in them through a new vehicle, hit some $32 billion last year, up from $26 billion in 2019, according to secondary intermediary Evercore Inc. </p><p>   BlackRock's secondary group says that being part of a massive firm brings advantages. BlackRock's large number of relationships, direct investments and in-house expertise gives the secondary group an advantage when sourcing or analyzing deals, said Mr. Lessar. \"We can tap into that very seamlessly,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
