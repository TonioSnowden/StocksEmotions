  "text": "<p>Paul Vienick will lead online investing, according to the memo. He was previously a top executive at Charles Schwab Corp.'s TD Ameritrade and he held top jobs at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America's Merrill Lynch unit.</p><p>Andrea Finan will run the bank's self-directed investing business. She was previously at Goldman, where she helped launch Marcus Invest.</p><p>JPMorgan is working on new services to launch early next year, including margin and securities-based lending, said people familiar with the bank. Those offerings have become popular with investors who trade on online platforms like Robinhood Markets Inc.</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic supercharged the growth of online investing. Online brokerages added more than 20 million accounts in 2020, according to a report this month from financial consultant Aite-Novarica Group.</p><p>JPMorgan launched its online offering, You Invest, in 2018. While online is the fastest-growing part of the bank's wealth business, it lags behind rivals in assets and accounts, the people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Aite-Novarica included JPMorgan on a list of banks that \"don't field truly competitive offerings\" in online wealth management. The bank's affluent customer base represents an opportunity, but growth would require major investments, the report said.</p><p>JPMorgan combined some internal wealth-management operations into a U.S. Wealth Management division in late 2019. You Invest became JPMorgan Self-Directed Investing. The bank has largely focused on improving some of the online platform's basic functions and feel.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
