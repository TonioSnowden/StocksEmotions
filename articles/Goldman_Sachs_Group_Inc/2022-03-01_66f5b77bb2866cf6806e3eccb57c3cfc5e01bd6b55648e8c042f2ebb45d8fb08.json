Here's the latest:</p> <p><strong>Big business talk of cutting links</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Shell</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf7f4bc0-f3a1-4863-809f-c08f6e48642a\">announced plans</a> on Monday to end all three of its ventures with Kremlin-backed <strong>Gazprom</strong> as well as to cease involvement with the controversial <strong>Nord Stream 2 </strong>pipeline between Russia and Germany.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>BP</strong> said over the weekend that it's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b4968fa-40d8-40ae-b2f9-f12cd8b23f9c\">seeking to divest</a> the near-20 per cent stake in Russian state oil company <strong>Rosneft</strong> that it has held since 2013. The company also said its chief executive <strong>Bernard Looney</strong> and his predecessor <strong>Bob Dudley</strong> would step down from the Rosneft board. </p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Norway's <strong>Equinor</strong> said it was “exiting” joint ventures in Russia, following the announcement by the country's $1.3tn oil fund — the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b6fab6b-8dcb-4d04-8f6d-2b434dd55c5e\">to scrap</a> its $3bn in Russian investments.</p></li>  <li><p>Germany's <strong>Daimler Truck</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4b5ade3-01d1-4db8-b197-257051656684\">severed its partnerships</a> with Russian businesses while <strong>Jaguar Land Rover</strong> and Swedish carmaker <strong>Volvo</strong> said they were halting deliveries of cars to the country.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Banks feel the brunt of Russia holdings</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Citigroup </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b51f1bb3-ddc2-49e3-bc26-b211d0f820cb\">disclosed</a> that it has almost $10bn worth of exposure to Russia through loans, government debt and other assets, partly held through its Russian retail bank which it says it wants to sell, the latest in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1d0f4ae-5ffe-4222-a14d-beeeaf141537\">number of disappointments</a> for investors.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>JPMorgan Asset Management</strong> has <a href=\"https://am.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm-am-aem/emea/gb/en/supplemental/notice-to-shareholders/jpm-emerging-europe-equity-fund-ce-en.pdf\">halted trading</a> on one of its emerging market equity funds with exposure to Russian assets.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Billionaires in the fray</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p>Russian-Israeli mogul and <strong>Chelsea FC</strong> owner <strong>Roman Abramovich</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7cbbd456-a253-4de2-bb18-cd48aba5e4ff\">has distanced himself</a> from daily oversight of the <strong>Premier League</strong> football club. The billionaire is currently in Belarus <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3fe58bed-0435-4774-82e1-d7ad915bfe49\">“trying to help”</a> end the war in Ukraine at the request of Kyiv, according to his spokesman, while his London-listed steelmaker <strong>Evraz</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10acf71b-a1cc-4fca-a387-b62f54cac23f\">could potentially become the target</a> of sanctions from the west. </p></li>  <li><p>The EU <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85d76bd6-f585-4ac9-abae-b9abbf21e4bf\">has frozen the assets</a> and imposed a travel ban on a group of Russia's top oligarchs including banking and retail tycoon <strong>Mikhail Fridman </strong>and fellow <strong>Alfa Group </strong>shareholder <strong>Petr Aven</strong>; <strong>Igor Sechin</strong> and <strong>Nikolai Tokarev</strong>, the respective oil bosses behind <strong>Rosneft </strong>and <strong>Transneft</strong>; and financier <strong>Alisher Usmanov</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>Fridman, whose empire includes Russia's largest privately held lender <strong>Alfa-Bank</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b3ab6bb-f782-43fb-8afc-42d937147463\">condemned the war</a> in a letter to employees at his private equity firm <strong>LetterOne</strong>, while the US-sanctioned, strongly pro-Putin metals magnate<strong> Oleg Deripaska </strong>called for peace talks on social media.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Professional services firms in the spotlight</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>McKinsey</strong> boss <strong>Bob Sternfels</strong> said last week that the consultancy “will no longer serve any government entity in Russia”, where the company has more than 400 staff and partners.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Boston Consulting Group</strong> said the advisory is “thoroughly evaluating our entire portfolio of work in Russia” while <strong>Bain &amp; Co</strong>'s managing partner <strong>Manny Maceda</strong> also <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/manny-maceda_today-i-shared-a-note-with-my-global-colleagues-activity-6903871483840471040-0qOW/\">said</a> the group was “re-evaluating our work in Russia”. Like McKinsey, neither firm revealed whether they had cut ties with any Russian SOEs or state-linked entities.</p></li>  <li><p>Big Four accountancies <strong>PwC</strong>, <strong>EY</strong> and <strong>KPMG</strong> have made statements denouncing the war but also have yet to disclose whether they plan to drop any Russian government clients. </p></li> </ul> <p>The war in Ukraine continues to cause untold <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/635bdc06-b4ad-40d8-842b-4706d30de27c\">human suffering</a> and to have far-reaching repercussions as the rouble <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7148532-36cd-4683-8f1b-ea79428488c4\">plunges</a>, Germany <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df1cbca9-1f3f-4889-a626-8a36bdd43f65\">boosts its defences</a>, football authorities <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06677626-c933-4689-8123-41dc6f2143a9\">suspend</a> Russia's national team and clubs from major tournaments, and the Ukraine prepares to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/faf894e7-f7a8-4a48-a7ce-2738441ac079\">issue a “war bond”</a> to fund its armed forces.</p> <p>Keep up with the FT's coverage <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/war-in-ukraine\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Stephen Schwarzman's billion-dollar payday</h2> <p>One of the unwritten rules at <strong>Blackstone Group </strong>is that the firm returns most of its profits to shareholders via dividends. In practice, the policy means cutting ever more massive cheques to its founder <strong>Stephen Schwarzman</strong>.</p> <p>Schwarzman <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/20aacbc9-2176-481a-a367-7774c632054a\">made over $1bn last year</a>, DD's Antoine Gara reports, a record haul for the buyout billionaire as Blackstone's soaring profits enabled the group to boost its dividend 80 per cent. </p> <p>The Blackstone chief executive received over $940mn in dividends and about $150mn in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3771030c-b8ad-4da6-b0af-0311a8e82ec8#comments-anchor\">“carried interest”</a> compensation — the entitlement to a share of the profits on successful investments.</p> <p>Two other Blackstone executives earned nine-figure paydays: the firm's billionaire president <strong>Jonathan Gray</strong> and recently-retired vice-chair <strong>Hamilton James</strong>. Both received hauls of at least $160mn.</p> <p>This income dwarfs the money that investment banking chieftains like <strong>JPMorgan</strong>'s<strong> Jamie Dimon </strong>and <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>' <strong>David Solomon </strong>took home last year. Schwarzman raked in about 20 times that of Dimon's earnings, underscoring how private equity dealmakers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df74c731-4d50-4420-8380-c83205c4c055\">stand to make far more</a> than bankers and traders.</p> <p>Schwarzman, who likes to call Blackstone the “reference entity” in the buyout industry on shareholder calls, delivers on his bravado when it's time to tabulate what he makes at year-end.</p> <p><strong>KKR</strong>'s<strong> Henry Kravis </strong>and <strong>George Roberts </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/adce2f87-6508-441b-81b6-6aefe34738fa\">took home</a> more than $100mn in 2021 — less than a tenth of what Schwarzman received. This is partly because KKR pays out a far lower percentage of its profits in dividends, preferring instead to reinvest its profits.</p> <p>Kravis and Roberts both received about $67mn in carried interest and more than $40mn in dividends. It's good money, but nowhere near the cash bestowed upon Blackstone dealmakers.</p> <p>If getting rich is the primary objective of Wall Street, Schwarzman's methods are working best.</p> <h2>Consolidation heats up in US banking</h2> <p>The volatility plaguing markets recently hasn't deterred Canada's <strong>TD Bank Group</strong> from sealing a deal. The bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f1f74ec-f105-4c0b-9328-2b1c6f345c58\">made its largest acquisition</a> on Monday, agreeing to buy Tennessee-based <strong>First Horizon</strong> for $13.4bn and securing its position as the sixth-largest lender in the US.</p> <p>TD has been on a shopping spree for nearly two decades, buoyed by strict rules on large US rivals that have made it easier for lenders north of the border to act as consolidators of the fragmented American banking industry. It bought Maine-based <strong>Banknorth</strong> in 2004, <strong>Hudson United</strong> for $1.9bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c4fce86-f2cf-11d9-8094-00000e2511c8\">in 2005</a> and <strong>Commerce Bancorp</strong> for $8.9bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90415c6c-70ee-11dc-98fc-0000779fd2ac\">just ahead of the financial crisis</a>.</p> <p>The acquisition of First Horizon will boost TD's presence in the US south, enabling it to better compete with others that have trodden a similar path. North Carolina-headquartered <strong>BB&amp;T</strong> and Georgia's <strong>SunTrust </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0330a7e0-2aca-11e9-88a4-c32129756dd8\">merged</a> in 2019, and the merger between <strong>First Citizens</strong> and Missouri's<strong> CIT Group</strong> was completed last month. </p> <p>Banking in the sun states is only getting hotter. &#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>CNN</strong> has selected <strong>Chris Licht</strong>, <strong>CBS</strong>'s executive vice-president of special programming and producer of <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em>, as its next president to replace <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c7d48b0-eaac-421e-a38e-c54f354becdc\"><strong>Jeff Zucker</strong></a> once its parent <strong>WarnerMedia</strong> merges with<strong> Discovery </strong>this spring.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Estée Lauder</strong> <a href=\"https://www.elcompanies.com/en/news-and-media/newsroom/company-features/2022/company-update-john-demsey\">fired</a> its president <strong>John Demsey </strong>due to a post he made on <strong>Instagram </strong>that allegedly included a racial slur and a joke about Covid-19.</p></li>  <li><p>US law firm <strong>Fried Frank </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bbbb9acf-fed6-4560-b471-f79cc3ea9069\">has poached</a> 35 legal staff including five partners from its rival <strong>Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft</strong>, as fierce competition for lawyers rages across the industry.</p></li>  <li><p>London-based venture capital firm <strong>Atomico</strong> has fired <strong>Hiro Tamura</strong>, one of its most senior partners, following complaints from staff over his management style, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/iainmartin/2022/02/24/atomico-fires-top-vc-investor-hiro-tamura-over-staff-complaints/?sh=5b3b057c4cf7\">per Forbes</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>UBS</strong> has promoted <strong>Kelvin Barry </strong>and<strong> Richard Sleijpen</strong> as joint heads of global banking, Australasia, and<strong> Nick Alexander</strong> as head of coverage and advisory in the region along with several other promotions within the unit, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-25/ubs-is-said-to-name-new-australasia-global-banking-co-heads?srnd=deals&amp;sref=OziMsGoK\">per Bloomberg</a>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>The restless billionaire </strong>Fierce corporate raider Carl Icahn has lately portrayed a softer persona. But his returns paint a less flattering picture. After half a century of shareholder activism, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61f5d578-608c-4ec5-b378-2a84cf9fe5d3\">he tells DD's Antoine Gara</a> that he worries few investors are prepared to take his place.</p> <p><strong>Up and vanished </strong>Five years ago, Beijing security agents whisked Chinese billionaire Xiao Jianhua away in a wheelchair from the Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong.
