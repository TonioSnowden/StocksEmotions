  "title": "Delta Air Lines to impose $200 monthly surcharge on unvaccinated staff",
  "text": "<p>Delta Air Lines said it would start charging unvaccinated employees enrolled in its healthcare plan an additional $200 a month, becoming the latest US company to compel workers to get the Covid-19 jab. </p> <p>The first <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/745d6d29-86f1-4116-9e72-cdd5e7218f6e\">fully-fledged approval</a> of a Covid vaccine this week by the US Food and Drug Administration, which gave a green light to the BioNTech/Pfizer jab, has prompted a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/201e6f04-342a-4131-8150-b618ba448901\">string of companies</a> to introduce tougher rules on staff inoculations. </p> <p>Following the approval, Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e10c756-9ba0-41fb-b868-c4bee521079a\">urged business leaders</a> to “require vaccinations” for employees, and several have complied with the US president's request, including the investment bank Goldman Sachs, accountancy firm Deloitte and CVS Health, the country's biggest pharmacy operator. </p> <p>Delta is the first big US company to introduce a surcharge, although it stopped short of introducing a vaccine mandate, a step taken by rival United Airlines and national rail network <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0fc81133-3c8f-4b59-bc95-4ea79d5fca8f#post-3a381480-c854-41bd-9cb0-4c4a95b2920e\">Amtrak</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e07c7fd-b0bf-405d-ac4a-979990b2a7da\">Ed Bastian</a>, Delta chief executive, said the airline had decided to impose the $200 monthly surcharge from November to insulate its healthcare plan against the “financial risk” of paying for employees sick with Covid. </p> <p>In a memo to staff seen by the Financial Times, Bastian said the average cost to Delta for an employee's Covid-related hospitalisation was $40,000 per person and that all of its infected workers in recent weeks had not been fully vaccinated. </p> <p>In addition, a mask mandate will go into effect immediately for unvaccinated Delta workers, and beginning on September 12, employees who are not fully vaccinated must submit to a weekly test.</p> <p>Three-quarters of Delta employees were vaccinated, and Bastian said he wanted that number to rise to “as close to 100 per cent as possible”.</p> <p>Following the FDA's full approval of the Pfizer jab, “we can be confident that the . . . vaccine is safe and effective”, Bastian told staff. “The time for you to get vaccinated is now.”</p> <p>Bastian said the monthly surcharge was being introduced in part because of the fast-spreading Delta variant, which is now the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a18756ad-0b72-44ad-b90a-44f636787a75\">dominant strain</a> in the US. “Over the past few weeks, the fight has changed with the rise of the B.1.617.2 variant,” he said, pointing to the recent increase in hospitalisations and deaths in the US.</p> <p>The chief executive added that from September 30, only fully-vaccinated Delta employees with a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49641651-e10a-45f6-a7cc-8b8c7b7a9710\">breakthrough infection</a> would be eligible for up to 14 days of Covid pay protection while quarantining. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs this week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eed019a6-903f-4cfc-aaa1-777f00fa148a\">announced</a> that all staff and clients entering its offices will have to provide proof of vaccination from next month. All Goldman staff, regardless of vaccination status, will also have to submit to weekly Covid tests and wear masks in the office. </p> <p>United Airlines, the first US carrier to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/223425f7-2506-4984-9d87-38677e455d9b\">impose a vaccine mandate</a>, had told staff that they must be vaccinated within five weeks of the first full FDA approval of a jab. </p> <p>Vaccine requirements have encountered some pushback. Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas, signed an executive order on Wednesday barring public institutions and private entities receiving public funds in the state from issuing vaccine mandates. </p><p>Source: Steff Chavez in Chicago 2021 'Delta Air Lines to impose $200 monthly surcharge on unvaccinated staff' FT.com 25 August.
