  "text": "<p><strong>One fun thing to start: </strong>DD's Rob Smith has a proposition for a better way to gauge the market — the ratio of El Risitas to Dimitri memes on Twitter. Don't know what any of that means? Join him on an Alphaville anthropological tour of Finance Twitter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6136b589-41e7-450b-b443-18113d785e2c\">here</a>.</p> <p><strong>And don't miss this video: </strong>Regulatory scrutiny and waning investor enthusiasm has slowed the Spac dealmaking frenzy to a trickle. DD's Ortenca Aliaj <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/164af947-8b4f-4f9e-b6de-fec8e6b568aa\">explains why</a> more blank-cheque companies may be left in the cold.</p> <h2>Othello and Iago at Apollo?</h2> <p><strong>Leon Black</strong> is a well-known patron of the arts. </p> <p>At his alma mater, <strong>Dartmouth College</strong>, there's even a “Leon D Black Professor of Shakespearean Studies”. Perhaps then, it's not surprising that the bard showed up in his latest legal missive.</p> <p>On Monday, the founder of <strong>Apollo Global Management </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/395f2bf1-99d1-4104-baeb-90d55e168142\">expanded upon</a> his recently floated theory that a civil <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba1a0cef-f25c-42bd-ae12-ac4dfb6971d7\">sexual assault lawsuit</a> against him in New York state court was the product of retaliation by his Apollo co-founder <strong>Josh Harris</strong>, who didn't get the top job at Apollo after Black resigned a year ago. </p> <p>In a federal lawsuit filed in New York, Black referred to Harris as “like Shakespeare's Iago, enraged by being passed over for promotion, he turned his wrath on his mentor and leader”.</p> <p>The drama occurring now may not only resemble the plot of Othello. </p> <p>If anything, it might be inspired by Julius Caesar, another classic by Shakespeare, centred on a group of men who together wished to sack the Roman emperor. </p> <p>In Black's lawsuit, he alleged a “war council” that Harris quietly convened first to push his Apollo CEO candidacy and then to allegedly punish Black when the first goal failed (Black says the group used the <strong>Slack </strong>messaging service to avoid detection).</p> <p>Black said the Harris circle included three top law firms (which he didn't name) as well as three communications firms which he did name: <strong>Rubenstein</strong>, <strong>BerlinRosen</strong> and<strong> Finsbury Glover Hering</strong>. </p> <p>Black said that some of these firms were already representing Apollo institutionally and as such were conflicted from simultaneously representing Harris.</p> <p>To pursue his legal case, Black is attempting to obtain materials such as mobile phone records from Rubenstein to prove his conspiracy. For their part, Harris and the various advisers have all vigorously denied being part of any conspiracy to take down Black. Some even described his charges as “unhinged”.&#xa0;</p> <p>However the various lawsuits pan out, the latest twists in the narrative expose the quandaries of advisory shops. Each holds relationships with client firms broadly, as well as with powerful individual decision makers like Harris. </p> <p>When it was beginning to look like Black might leave Apollo, one can imagine these firms wanting to curry favour with his potential replacement by offering their services. </p> <p>What they likely didn't consider at the time was that Black would <a href=\"http://om/content/da3ae062-1b7c-41f5-ab78-07a7c6989379\">declare war</a> on Harris and that somehow they would be caught in the Shakespearean crossfire. </p> <h2>Corbin &amp; King needs more than just tea and sympathy</h2> <p>Londoners from TV presenters to food critics became suddenly interested in the machinations of the UK insolvency process on Tuesday. The reason? The owner of longstanding celebrity hang-outs <strong>The Wolseley</strong> and <strong>The Delaunay</strong> was pushed into administration by its majority shareholder late on Tuesday afternoon.</p> <p>As guests were forking up slices of the Wolseley's Battenburg cake around teatime, the Thai hotel group <strong>Minor </strong>put out a statement saying that the restaurant's owner <strong>Corbin &amp; King</strong> had been “unable to meet its financial obligations” having been in default on loans due since May 2020.</p> <p>Minor said that it had made “repeated” offers of cash to recapitalise the business but that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/123d94e8-7663-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab\"><strong>Jeremy King</strong></a>, Corbin &amp; King's chief executive and a reputed London restaurateur, had pushed back leaving the hotel group “no other viable option than to appoint administrators to the business”.</p> <p>The Wolseley, in particular, was a beloved haunt of the artist <strong>Lucian Freud</strong> before his death (he became such good friends with King that he painted a portrait of him) and has also been frequented by the likes of<strong> Kate Moss </strong>and <strong>Joan Collins</strong>. It may be the most glamorous former car showroom in London with a prime position on Piccadilly next door to The Ritz.</p> <p>A person close to Corbin &amp; King management <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1438dcf-c18f-4e8f-b4f4-f1778687e1c9\">told the FT</a> that Minor's attempts to recapitalise C&amp;K, which owns seven other restaurants, came with strings attached that involved King giving up his board position and shareholding in the company that he founded. </p> <p>The restaurant group, which has enjoyed bumper trading when it has been able to reopen between periods of Covid restrictions and lockdowns, has paid interest on the loans up to date and expected them to be refinanced, the source said.</p> <p>It's just the latest step in a long-running dispute around the Corbin &amp; King board table that started early in the pandemic with arguments over staffing and progress on new openings.</p> <p>While simultaneously fighting off a bout of Covid-19 and a<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/628c5e5b-e039-46c5-98ec-081595b028b6\"> court battle</a> with C&amp;K's insurer over unpaid claims, King <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/london-restaurateurs-behind-the-wolseley-line-up-hertz-backer-in-battle-with-thais-12524974\">initiated talks</a> with the US investment fund<strong> Knighthead</strong> in an effort to oust Minor from the business.</p> <p>Knighthead recently made a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/367bd407-80c7-4412-922b-ccdb546d4518\">roaring gain</a> from the car rental firm <strong>Hertz</strong>'s escape from bankruptcy so they seem an appropriate patron for C&amp;K in its hour of need. Yet the fate of The Wolseley now lies in the hands not of its ritzy customers but of the suited restructuring specialists at <strong>FRP Advisory</strong>.</p> <h2>Beijing's new listing rules spell trouble in a banker's paradise&#xa0;</h2> <p>The Wall Street banks that have long stood as financial ambassadors to China's buzzing tech scene — and benefited in the form of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30d0d084-eb0d-4b68-a982-dfe24554a1ad\">over $1bn in fees</a> over the past several years — have suddenly found themselves lost in translation.</p> <p>Asia's top banking lobby group, which counts <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, <strong>Morgan Stanley </strong>and <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> as members, has written to Chinese regulators highlighting their “great concern” on Beijing's new rules for companies listing overseas, insiders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c186952f-27dc-40dc-9b9f-03af667943d7\">told the FT's Tabby Kinder</a>.</p> <p>The assembly of foreign banks called the framework “completely unclear”, raising the possibility of higher costs and regulatory risks for lenders. </p> <p>Investment bankers are also worried the rules could grant Beijing unprecedented power beyond its borders, a source tells Tabby, since it would give China's financial regulator oversight of US listings of companies that are incorporated overseas, such as in the Cayman Islands.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7689489c-cdad-4596-a7c6-0774ed68bf5a#comments-anchor\">The rules</a>, which one Wall Street executive in Hong Kong described as “vague” and “ambiguous”, lay out a new normal for relations for US banks and China, threatening to fizzle the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5e09db3-549e-4a0b-8dbf-e499d0606df4\">trillion-dollar love affair</a> that began heating up last year.</p> <p>If the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9c0b4ab-b4db-443f-8b39-e9198421d373\">spectacular collapse</a> of <strong>Ant Financial</strong>'s $37bn IPO didn't tip Wall Street off on changing times, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7dac49e-fa0c-4445-8bef-c86686e9b4bb\">disastrous retreat</a> of Chinese ride-hailing group <strong>Didi Chuxing </strong>from the <strong>New York Stock Exchange</strong> clearly did the trick.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <p><strong>BlackRock </strong>and <strong>Temasek</strong>'s sustainable investment partnership<strong> Decarbonization Partners </strong>has announced a new investment team:</p> <ul>  <li><p>Former <strong>BP Ventures </strong>global head<strong> Meghan Sharp</strong> joins in the same position based in San Francisco.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Teresa O'Flynn</strong>, a managing director for the partnership and former head of sustainable investing for <strong>BlackRock Alternative Investors</strong>, has been promoted to senior investor based in London.</p></li>  <li><p>Temasek's energy investment head <strong>Pieter Houlleberghs</strong> joins as a managing director in New York.</p></li>  <li><p>Temasek director <strong>SuetChee Chiong</strong> and vice-president <strong>Jianrong Liu</strong> join as directors in Singapore.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Ian Kitchenham</strong>, former operating chief and head of strategy for BlackRock's Asia-Pacific global credit arm, joins as a senior investment and strategy leader.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>KKR</strong> has appointed <strong>Todd Builione </strong>as global head of private wealth. He was previously president of <strong>KKR Credit and Markets</strong>.<br><br><strong>Steve Golsby</strong> and <strong>Simon Patterson</strong> are retiring from <strong>Tesco</strong>'s board following the company's annual general meeting in June. Golsby's role as remuneration committee chair will be filled by board member and former <strong>Countrywide</strong> chief <strong>Alison Platt</strong>.</p> <p>Medical technology group <strong>Smith &amp; Nephew </strong>has appointed <strong>Jo Hallas</strong>, chief of construction supplier <strong>Tyman</strong>, as a non-executive director.</p> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Frozen assets</strong> Low taxes transformed the sleepy Swiss town of Zug into a decentralised finance paradise. But recent sell-offs and regulatory clampdowns could deliver the new hotspot a particularly bitter “crypto winter”.
