  "text": "<p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX fell 12.23 points, or 0.3%, ending at 3,946.56.</p><p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA shed 7.51 points, or less than 0.1%, to finish at 33,546.32, after falling as much as 314 points in the morning session.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP declined 38.70 points, or 0.4%, to end at 11,144.96.</p><p>Stocks finished lower on Wednesday for the second time in three sessions, with the S&amp;P 500 failing to break above 4,000. The Dow fell to 33,554, the S&amp;P 500 declined to 3,959, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped to 11,184.</p><p>What drove markets</p><p>The Federal Reserve's benchmarkinterest rate will need to be increased further to a level high enough to bring inflation down, said St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, on Thursday.</p><p>\"The change in the monetary policy stance appears to have had only limited effects on observed inflation, but market pricing suggests disinflation is expected in 2023,\" said Bullard, in a speech in Louisville, Ky.</p><p>While Bullard didn't explicitly say how high he thought the policy rate needed to go, a chart in his presentation suggested it could be somewhere around a 5%-7% range.</p><p>See: This is the chart that is rattling U.S. financial markets Thursday</p><p>It's possible Bullard may have gone \"overboard\" by suggesting in a slide-show presentation that the Fed funds rate target may need to rise as high as 7%, Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of Bleakley Financial Group, said in a note to clients Thursday. However, investors may be overreacting to his comments since Bullard won't have a vote on the Fed's policy-setting committee next year, he said.</p><p>The Minneapolis Fed's Neel Kashkari also said that he wants to be sure inflation has stopped climbingbefore he would support stopping interest rate hikes. \"It's an open question of how far we are going to have to go with interest rates to bring that demand down in the balance,\" he told the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce in an event webcast on Thursday.</p><p>Fed funds futures traders are presently anticipating that the key benchmark rate will peak somewhere between 4.75% and 5.5% next spring, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.</p><p>Chris Senyek, chief investment officer at Wolfe Research, said that Bullard's speech this morning bolster's their view that the Fed may hike as high as 6%.</p><p>\"We believe that our intermediate-term bearish base case remains fully intact!\" a team of strategists led by Senyek said in a note on Thursday.</p><p>See: A 6% fed-funds rate? Some investors say the risk is there, bringing the prospect of more painful Treasury selloffs</p><p>Treasury yields edged higher on Thursday, with the yield on the 10-year note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y climbing 8.1 basis points to 3.774%. The yield on the 2-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD02Y gained to 4.452% from 4.363% on Wednesday.</p><p>If there's anything to be gleaned from the public commentary unleashed by Bullard and other Fed officials this week, it's that \"a rate-hike pause may not be coming soon, and cuts definitely aren't coming soon unless something breaks,\" said Callie Cox, U.S. investment analyst at eToro.</p><p>Investment banks have been adjusting their expectations for where interest rates may peak next year, with Goldman Sachs Group GS calling for the Fed funds rate to peak at 5.25%. Also, Wednesday's stronger-than-expected October retail sales number helped stoke fears that the Fed may need to be even more aggressive, diminishing hopes for a dovish pivot, as Deutsche Bank' Jim Reid said.</p><p>It also could be a reason why momentum that had carried the S&amp;P 500 index to its highest level since mid-September has dissipated this week as the large-cap index has failed to close above 4,000.</p><p>In U.S. economic data released Thursday, housing startsshowed that new-home construction has slowed, jobless claims fell slightly, while the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its gauge of regional business activity sank to negative 19.4 in November from negative 8.7 in the prior month.</p><p>Aside from Bullard and Kashkari, Fed Gov. Philip Jefferson also said that achieving low inflationwas a key for inclusive economic growth.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Macy's Inc. stock M finished 15% higher after the department store chain beat consensus estimates for the third quarter and raised its full-year profit guidance.</p><p>* Kohl's Corp. KSS rose 5.4% after the department store chain reported fiscal third-quarter profit and revenue above expectations, but withdrew its full-year outlook citing \"significant\" macroeconomic headwinds and the unexpected transition of its chief executive officer.</p><p>* Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA jumped 7.8% after the companytopped adjusted earnings expectationsfor the latest quarter and said it was upsizing its buyback program.</p><p>* Nvidia Corp. NVDA shares declined by 1.5% after the chip maker said modified servers to China mostly made up for an expected $400 million shortfall due to a U.S. ban on certain tech sales, and announced it's making progress in helping customers reduce high inventories. Nvidia reported third-quarter net income of $680 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $2.46 billion, or 97 cents a share, in the year-ago period.</p><p>* Cisco Systems Inc.'s CSCO stock ended 4.9% lower after the networking-technology company delivered better-than-expected numberson the top and bottom line, and offered encouraging guidance.</p><p>â€” Jamie Chisholm contributed reporting</p><p>Stocks post first back-to-back loss in 2 weeks after Fed speakers suggest interest rates may top out higher</p>",
