  "text": "<p>Credit Suisse is set to raise billions in capital, carve up its investment bank and cut thousands of jobs in an effort to restructure its business and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2ba41c5-586c-44ec-a01f-73f522a5850f\">move on from a litany of scandals</a> and a SFr4bn third-quarter loss.</p> <p>The Swiss bank is&#xa0;seeking to raise SFr4bn ($4.05bn) of capital, including SFr1.5bn from the&#xa0;Saudi National Bank, which will become the second-largest shareholder in the group, owning 9.9 per cent.</p> <p>Credit Suisse&#xa0;has also agreed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1c0fc36-4d32-4ae8-a956-18b15ce99bab\">to sell part of its securitised products unit</a> to US investment groups Pimco and Apollo and outlined plans to spin off its capital markets and advisory business over the next three years under a rejuvenated CS First Boston brand.</p> <p>The moves are part of Credit Suisse's second strategic revamp in less than a year following a series of losses and crises, including the collapse of Archegos and Greensill Capital, that prompted wholesale changes of the bank's leadership.</p> <p>“This is a historic moment for Credit Suisse,” said chief executive Ulrich Körner who was appointed in July with a mandate to strip back the scandal-prone investment bank. </p> <p>Credit Suisse said it would cut SFr2.5bn of costs, representing 15 per cent of its cost base, by 2025 and shrink its workforce from 52,000 to 43,000 over the next three years, including plans to cut 2,700 roles by the end of this year.</p> <p>Shares in Credit Suisse, which have halved in value this year, fell as much as 12 per cent this morning after it unveiled the plan to overhaul its operations.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper:</strong> British-South African banker Dixit Joshi became Credit Suisse's new chief financial officer at the beginning of this month. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e875b347-a24e-4ccb-bae8-ebc9430d7344\">He faces a daunting challenge.</a></p></li> </ul> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Exclusive: US to withdraw permanent F-15 fighter force from Okinawa</strong> The US air force plans <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/271c0c93-eae0-4835-a9f9-882a1d0eb3b5\">to replace its entire fleet of F-15 fighter jets</a> based in Okinawa, Japan, with a “rotational” force. The decision has triggered alarm in some parts of the Japanese government and the Pentagon because the air force does not intend to replace them with a permanent presence in the near term, sending a dangerous signal to China, officials say. </p> <p><strong>2. More than $65bn wiped off the value of Meta </strong>Facebook's owner reported another quarter of declining revenues after the market closed yesterday and failed to convince investors that its bet on the metaverse and AI were paying off. Meta shares <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e457f1a-ee9f-419d-b8aa-2b54f7809705\">dropped 19 per cent in after-hours trading</a> as it joined other technology groups in warning that an economic slowdown was hammering its advertising business. </p> <p><strong>3. Fossil fuel demand to peak around 2030, says IEA chief</strong> The world is approaching a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fd06f38-ec60-4043-bcdd-adcba8beb006\">pivotal moment in energy history</a>”, Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, tells the Financial Times, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine accelerating a peak in fossil fuel consumption. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Read more:</strong> The US is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4adf3d8-e7fc-413d-a69d-eb7ae9207e0a\">exporting record volumes of oil</a> and taking on a bigger role as a fuel supplier in response to the global energy crunch caused by Russia's war in Ukraine.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>4. Germany unveils plans to legalise cannabis</strong> The German government has unveiled <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac495141-4270-454f-a5aa-53a9f2152baf\">a detailed framework for the legalisation of cannabis</a>, setting the country on course to becoming the world's largest regulated national market for the drug. Unveiling the plans, health minister Karl Lauterbach said the package of measures could be seen as “the most liberal cannabis legalisation project in Europe”.</p> <p><strong>5. Elon Musk visits Twitter HQ ahead of deal deadline</strong> The billionaire <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/966b030b-1ff0-422f-84be-3aadc3317401\">visited Twitter's San Francisco headquarters yesterday</a> and plans to address staffers on Friday as his $44bn deal to buy the social media platform looks set to inch over the finish line. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585341984679469056?cxt=HHwWgICpxdaIooAsAAAA\">posted a short video</a> of himself on Twitter walking into the social media company's offices, carrying a sink, with the caption: “Entering Twitter HQ — let that sink in!” Musk also changed his biography on his Twitter profile to read “Chief Twit”.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>US GDP </strong>The US economy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c57e1bf3-b453-430c-ba0d-738fb8b1888e\">is expected to have grown by 2.4 per cent</a> on an annualised basis in the third quarter after contracting in the first half of the year. The sharp rebound would calm discussions surrounding whether the US is already in a recession, but not enough to stave off fears of one in 2023. </p> <p><strong>Earnings </strong>Apple and Amazon will close out a week of Big Tech earnings. Apple is forecast to have earned $1.27 a share on revenue of $88.9bn in the latest quarter, up from $1.24 a share on revenue of $83.4bn the prior year. Amazon is expected to have earned 22 cents a share on revenue of $127.5bn in the third quarter compared with 31 cents a share on revenue of $110.8bn a year ago. Chipmaker Intel, which is expected to report a revenue decline as the PC market weakens, will join Apple and Amazon in reporting after the bell. McDonald's, Mastercard, Northrop Grumman, Merck, Caterpillar, Altria, Southwest Airlines, Hertz, Oshkosh, Honeywell, Lazard Asset Management and Janus Henderson report before the market opens.</p> <p><strong>Monetary policy</strong> The European Central Bank is expected to start the delicate process of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a28fe5d6-3beb-4794-b49c-aff4fabc0cd7\">shrinking its balance sheet</a> at today's meeting of the central bank's governing council in Frankfurt. Yesterday the Bank of Canada indicated it was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3124c03b-db13-41a7-a8a2-abf5ea2edb4b\">reaching the end of its monetary tightening cycle</a>. The comments came after it raised its key interest rate 0.50 percentage points to 3.75 per cent, taking it to its highest level since 2008.</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>The big winner in the latest Goldman Sachs reshuffle</strong> Having developed a reputation as one of chief executive David Solomon's most trusted fixers, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9d2fd1b-0d7d-4da9-a170-937c0d5f7112\">Marc Nachmann</a> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9d2fd1b-0d7d-4da9-a170-937c0d5f7112\">was rewarded with a job as head of the newly merged $2.4tn asset and wealth management division</a> that is seen as crucial to a higher valuation for the company.</p> <p><strong>From ‘moron premium' to ‘dullness dividend' </strong>New UK prime minister Rishi Sunak yesterday postponed his government's highly anticipated financial statement. The delayed “Halloween Budget” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1dc057df-2ef0-47fa-bd40-3f5d229b0cff\">will now be presented on November 17</a>, improving the likely outlook for the country's public finances.</p> <p><strong>America's brittle consensus on Ukraine</strong> The progressive Democrats that this week called for direct talks between Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin were guilty only <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99e4412c-b95a-4fb2-8149-670960b3034f\">of speaking out too soon</a>, says Edward Luce. The moment for peace talks to begin is probably nearer than most people think, he argues. </p> <p><strong>What does the music business do with Kanye West? </strong>The world's largest music companies are rushing to contain the fallout from a furore over anti-Semitic comments made by Kanye West, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83126f95-1982-4062-b77c-41afe1d5afcf\">condemning the rapper's remarks despite continuing to host his songs</a> on their platforms.</p> <p><strong>The golden age of AI-generated art is here — and getting weird</strong> AI image-generation technology is advancing swiftly and is already “a major disruptive force”, says British artist Matthew Stone. Six months ago most tools struggled to create human faces. Now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/073ea888-20d7-437c-8226-a2dd9f276de4\">amazing and wild leaps of imagination</a> can be produced in under a minute without much technical expertise.</p> <h1>Film</h1> <p>Reportedly banned in China merely for spotlighting the hard lives of the rural poor, the sleeper hit <em>Return to Dust </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1cc4df7-b671-4a15-b417-48f18b722b34\">appears as a snapshot of the country's political climate</a> — and a symbol of the vulnerability of art.</p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Gary Jones and Emily Goldberg  2022 'FirstFT: ‘A historic moment for Credit Suisse'' FT.com 27 October.
