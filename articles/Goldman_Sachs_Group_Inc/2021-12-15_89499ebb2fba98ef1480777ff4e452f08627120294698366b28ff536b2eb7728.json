  "title": "Pro Bankruptcy Briefing: Israeli Spyware Firm Seeks Sale; Brooklyn Developer Files Chapter 11",
  "text": "<p>Israeli cyber firm NSO explores sale, closure of spyware unit. Israeli cybersecurity company NSO Group is exploring a potential sale of business or the closure of its controversial spyware unit, according to a person familiar with the matter. The move follows a recent U.S. decision to blacklist the company over allegations that NSO's surveillance software, called Pegasus, has been used inappropriately. Those pressures have put the company at risk of defaulting on its debt, according to ratings firm Moody's Corp.</p><p>NSO is in talks with two U.S.-based investment funds about a potential sale or refinancing plan, the person said. Options being discussed include NSO sharply limiting the countries to which it sells spyware or using the technology and human talent in its Pegasus unit to create a cyber defensive product instead. NSO has hired Moelis &amp; Co., the New York-based advisory firm, to lead the talks.</p><p>Brooklyn developer All Year files for bankruptcy. Brooklyn property developer Yoel Goldman's All Year Holdings Ltd. filed for bankruptcy Tuesday to protect itself from potential litigation in the U.S. and Israel while continuing negotiations with creditors over $1.56 billion in debt. All Year has been in restructuring talks with bondholders since April and looking for investors to either recapitalize or outright buy its property business, according to papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.</p><p>Under an agreement between All Year's board and Mr. Goldman, who owns 100% of the developer, he can't remove directors or take actions that would negatively affect the restructuring process. He allegedly agreed to a $37 million judgment against All Year without board approval, prompting the chapter 11 filing.</p><p>Economy</p><p>Fed prepares faster end to stimulus, opening door to earlier rate rises. Federal Reserve officials are likely to quicken the wind down of their bond-buying stimulus program at the conclusion of their two-day policy meeting Wednesday, opening the door to interest rate increases in the first half of next year. The move to end the stimulus program sooner than officials planned at their meeting last month offers the most concrete sign of how Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's focus is shifting towards preventing higher inflation from becoming entrenched and away from fostering a rapid rebound in hiring.</p><p>Bankruptcy</p><p>Judge flags problems with Puerto Rico bankruptcy plan. The judge overseeing Puerto Rico's bankruptcy case identified several \"problematic\" aspects of the U.S. territory's debt-restructuring plan and asked for written responses from its proponents.</p><p>Judge Laura Taylor Swain said Tuesday that several plan provisions meant to override and preempt Puerto Rico law are overly vague and broad. These preemption provisions \"should be directed to specified legislation and should include language specifically addressing the scope of such preemption,\" the judge said in a written ruling.</p><p>She said she also saw \"little factual basis in the record\" for overriding an expansion of pension benefits signed by Gov. Pedro Pierluisi last year. The oversight board supervising Puerto Rico's finances has sought to reverse the pension expansion, saying it is unaffordable.</p><p>If approved, the restructuring plan would drive down $33 billion in bonds and other claims against Puerto Rico and lift the territory out of the bankruptcy proceedings it entered in 2017. — Andrew Scurria</p><p>Boy Scouts abuse victims angry, not confused, judge says. Thousands of sex abuse victims who are jointly represented by three warring law firms in the Boy Scouts of America's bankruptcy case seem to be angry rather than confused by their attorneys' divergent advice, a bankruptcy judge said.</p><p>Judge Laurie Selber Silverstein of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. denied a request by an official committee of survivors to order the three firms to send their roughly 17,000 jointly-represented clients a letter explaining their opposing views on the Boy Scouts' sex-abuse settlement plan.</p><p>Ordering a joint letter won't lessen the chances of lawyers fighting the voting results or potentially seeking to disqualify votes, Judge Silverstein said. The three firms' clients are aware that their lawyers disagree on how to vote, the judge also said. The Boy Scouts need overwhelming support from the 82,200 men who have filed abuse claims for the youth group's roughly $2.6 billion settlement to win court approval. — Soma Biswas</p><p>In Other News</p><p>Defaults and impairments are rising in the municipal-bond market, a potential warning sign for investors in junk munis, the best-performing sector of state and local-government debt. The trend comes against a backdrop in which riskier issuers have gained more market access and investors awash in cash have grown more comfortable with weaker protections as yields remain well below historical averages.
