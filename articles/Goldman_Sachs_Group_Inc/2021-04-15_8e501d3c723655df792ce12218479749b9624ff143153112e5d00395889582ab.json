  "text": "<p>Bank of America kept the bonanza earnings season for US lenders rolling by comfortably beating first-quarter forecasts and announcing a $25bn share buyback against a backdrop of soaring revenues for investment arms and an improving outlook for loan losses. </p> <p>Net income at the second-biggest US bank by assets more than doubled in the first quarter, fuelled by a $1.9bn gain on the improving outlook for loan losses. Investment banking fees rose 62 per cent.</p> <p>Its board has authorised a $25bn common share buyback “over time” that will release some of the $35bn in excess capital sitting on BofA's balance sheet after regulators restricted banks' capacity to return cash to shareholders in case the pandemic triggered a wave of defaults. </p> <p>Quarterly payouts remain<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16ec2a4d-b39a-4ecf-b0b6-af5f4469d18b\"> capped</a> by the Federal Reserve until at least the second quarter, but fears of massive loan losses are now abating amid widespread belief that the worst of the US pandemic has passed. </p> <p>The improved outlook allowed Bank of America to book a $1.9bn loan loss benefit in the first quarter. It now expects the cost of defaults to come in far below the bumper amounts set aside under accounting rules last year, including a $4.8bn charge in the first quarter of 2020. </p> <p>Net income for the first quarter of 2021 came in at just over $8bn in the first three months of 2021, versus the $4bn it made in the same period a year ago. Analysts had expected $5.6bn.</p> <p>“While low interest rates continued to challenge revenue, credit costs improved and we believe that progress in the health crisis and the economy point to an accelerating recovery,” chair and chief executive Brian Moynihan said on Thursday, describing the first quarter as “exceptional”.</p> <p>Glenn Schorr, analyst at Evercore ISI, said BofA had continued a trend of “putting up good results now and being well positioned for a pick-up in the US economy”.</p> <p>BofA's results mirror the pattern set by JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs on Wednesday when they <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5cc8f198-345f-4a21-997f-acc841c7b39b\">kicked off</a> Wall Street's earnings season with profit growth well above what analysts expected, on the back of a recovering US economy and surging markets for trading and dealmaking. Citigroup said on Thursday that its first-quarter income <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ca269fc-f257-4aed-a5c9-03e140a10a54\">more than trebled</a> versus a year earlier. </p> <p>BofA's investment banking fees rose to $2.25bn from $1.39bn a year earlier, better than the 57 per cent reported by JPMorgan Chase but worse than the 73 per cent rise at Goldman Sachs. BofA's trading fees were up almost 10 per cent but its equities desk failed to capture the big lift enjoyed by rivals. Chief financial officer Paul Donofrio told reporters he felt “very good” about BofA's performance in equities, and that its business tends to be less volatile than peers. </p> <p>Group revenues were flat at $22.8bn, hinting at the challenges to BofA's core lending and deposit-taking businesses in an environment where low interest rates are crushing margins, while pandemic-related uncertainty is making borrowers think twice. </p> <p>Donofrio said consumer bank “has been more heavily impacted by the low interest rate environment and weak loan demand, and therefore, is still recovering”. That division's revenue slipped fell from $9.13bn a year ago to $8.07bn in the first quarter of 2021, though net income in consumer banking still grew almost 50 per cent thanks to releases of loan loss reserves. </p> <p>Donofrio said he expected net interest income to grow and said the fourth quarter's net interest income could be $1bn higher than the first quarter's. Chris Kotowski, analyst at Oppenheimer, said the fact that net interest income of $10.3bn held steady with the previous two quarters “indicates that we've probably hit the bottom”. </p> <p>The bank's shares were up 0.43 per cent in pre-market trading.</p><p>Source: Laura Noonan 2021 'Bank of America's quarterly profit more than doubles' FT.com 15 April.
