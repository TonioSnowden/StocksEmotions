  "text": "<p>Good morning from <strong>Magic Johnson</strong>‘s world, the rest of us are just living in it. The retired basketball legend is the subject of not one but two current prestige streaming programmes (a traditional docuseries on <strong>Apple+</strong> and an <strong>HBO</strong> drama on the 1980s<strong> Los Angeles Lakers</strong>, the perfect dramedy if you love <strong>Adam McKay</strong> and <a href=\"https://basketball.fandom.com/wiki/Celtics-Lakers_Rivalry\">hate Boston</a>). He's already a co-owner of three Los Angeles pro teams: baseball's <strong>Dodgers</strong>, basketball's <strong>Sparks</strong>, and football's <strong>LAFC, </strong>and this week he is joining a bid for American football's <strong>Denver Broncos</strong>.</p> <p>The real news is that he is joining a bid led by private equity tycoons <strong>Josh Harris </strong>and <strong>David Blitzer</strong>, and not that of Johnson's current partner at the Dodgers, <strong>Todd Boehly</strong> (you may recall these individuals as finalists and winning bidder, respectively, for <strong>Chelsea FC</strong>). A source close to the American football bidding process tells me that, should they win, the Johnson and Harris partnership would emphasise “diversity, equity and inclusion and social justice” in their stewardship of the Broncos. It's no secret the <strong>National Football League</strong> has never had a black owner and currently has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19907879-325e-4564-9d45-2cf53b7ee990\">a messy lawsuit on its hands</a> alleging racist hiring practices among coaches; not only is Johnson a black leader but he adds compelling gravitas as both a sportsman and a manager.</p> <p>In the meantime, a group led by US financier Boehly has agreed a £4.25bn deal to acquire Chelsea, capping weeks of intrigue. For now, we have insight on just what happened with that last-minute bid by <strong>Jim Ratcliffe</strong> of <strong>Ineos</strong>, and a troubling status update on the detention of US basketball star <strong>Brittney Griner</strong> in Russia. Do read on —<em> Sara Germano, US sports business correspondent.</em></p> <h1>The financial fiasco behind Brittney Griner's detention in Russia</h1> <p>More than two months after she was arrested at a Moscow airport in February, the US government on Tuesday said it has determined basketball star Brittney Griner was “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfd055c6-caf8-4a6c-8936-2243355c5237\">wrongfully detained</a>” by Russia.</p> <p>The declaration by the US state department elevates the case of the double Olympic champion from a legal matter to a diplomatic negotiation, with the stakes ever higher given that the US and Russia are at loggerheads over the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine. The <strong>White House</strong> said that special presidential envoy for hostage affairs <strong>Roger Carstens</strong> will now take over the case, though neither authority gave insight into why they're just now negotiating on Griner's behalf.</p> <p>To back up: Griner, a star centre for the US <strong>Women's National Basketball Association</strong>, was travelling to Russia from New York in mid-February for her off-season stint playing for <strong>UMMC Ekaterinburg </strong>when she was detained for possession of narcotic hash oil, according to Russian authorities. News of her detention was only made public in March, more than a week after Russian president <strong>Vladmir Putin</strong> sent troops into Ukraine, and the delicate nature of a high-profile arrest of a sport celebrity led to an initial period of quiet strategization among Griner's family, business partners, and legal team about next steps.</p> <p>But underlying the now-supercharged effort to secure Griner's release is the financial circumstances that sent her to Russia in the first place: for years, the top women basketball players in the world have decamped east of the Ural Mountains for lush salaries within the <strong>EuroLeague</strong>. Before Griner, fellow WNBA legends <strong>Sue Bird</strong> and <strong>Diana Taurasi</strong> were fixtures at “Ekat”, as the team is sometimes called, where they earned <a href=\"https://30for30podcasts.com/episodes/the-spy-who-signed-me/\">many multiples</a> over their pay in the W, fixed at a hard salary cap in the low six figures. </p> <p>The salary cap isn't unique to the WNBA — each of the <strong>NBA, NHL</strong> and <strong>NFL</strong> have limits on roster payrolls — but the ceiling of just over $200,000 for current players is one hundred times below pro contracts in the men's leagues. </p> <p>Still, a recent surge in the league's popularity — ratings for the most recent season rose 49 per cent year-on-year — could portend less reliance on off-season gigs: “There are definitely still challenges as it pertains to the overseas commitments”, said <strong>LaChina Robinson</strong>, an <strong>ESPN</strong> analyst before tip-off of the WNBA's 26th season on Friday. “Yes, we all want players to make more money, but, overall, there's more money coming into the league, and more eyes on the product and that's always a really good thing”.</p> <p>This week, the WNBA began honouring Griner by featuring her initials and jersey number on courts. As the <strong>Phoenix Mercury</strong> star's diplomatic saga persists, more attention than possibly ever before will be on the women's game. </p> <h1>Why Jim Ratcliffe's bid for Chelsea fell on deaf ears</h1> <p>It's not every day that investment bankers give the “cold shoulder” to one of the world's richest men.</p> <p>But merchant bank <strong>Raine Group </strong>refused to entertain a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62008757-5358-4e1f-845e-e830c38b8020\">last-gasp offer</a> for <strong>Chelsea </strong>from <strong>Jim Ratcliffe</strong>, founder of petrochemicals company <strong>Ineos</strong>, who has lined up £4.25bn to acquire and fund the football club.</p> <p>Instead, Raine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e665bbd-034f-4c21-b4a8-eb5a91999763\">has gone with</a> US financier Todd Boehly and investment firm <strong>Clearlake Capital</strong>, backed by Swiss billionaire <strong>Hansjörg Wyss</strong>. </p> <p>Private equity tycoons Josh Harris and David Blitzer, not to mention basketball moguls <strong>Stephen Pagliuca</strong> and <strong>Larry Tanenbaum</strong>, also made the shortlist, finishing as runners-up to Boehly.</p> <p>So why did Ineos's “British bid, for a British club” fail to make the grade?</p> <p>For starters, Ratcliffe was late to the party. Too late, it would appear, having dodged the formal process that opened when oligarch <strong>Roman Abramovich </strong>confirmed he was selling the west London club soon after Russia invaded Ukraine.</p> <p>It doesn't help that Ineos has a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c01749e7-3462-4f5f-bc91-a9f95a96f00c\">history of questioning</a> if Chelsea is worth the money, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31b5e7e0-5c76-11ea-b0ab-339c2307bcd4\">baulking</a> at an asking price of more than £2bn in 2018 when Abramovich ultimately opted against selling. Ratcliffe also turned down the opportunity to bid ahead of earlier deadlines in this year's auction.</p> <p>Ineos director <strong>Tom Crotty </strong>told Scoreboard that the group's sense of the price range was “a lot more sensible” than expected. He also pointed to increases in the value of the <strong>English Premier League</strong>'s international broadcast deals, which are expected to generate more than £10bn over the next three seasons.</p> <p>“The numbers make sense,” he says. “We put the bid in and that's it really, I suppose you can say we've had the cold shoulder.”</p> <p>But the crux of it really comes down to leverage. Raine took three sets of deep-pocketed investors to the final stage of the auction, with two ready to step up in the event that Boehly's group withdrew. </p> <p>Allowing Ineos to crash the party risked driving the shortlisted bidders away. That's far from ideal given that negotiations with Ratcliffe were not guaranteed to result in a deal.</p> <p>Still, Ineos isn't minded to go away. </p> <p>“We don't tend to give up on things too easily,” said Crotty. “Until this is a finished deal we'll probably keep reminding people we're offering an option.”</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Former <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>executive <strong>Gerry Cardinale</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8cecd68-7137-42b3-ae23-d27c27885dca\">butted in</a> on asset manager<strong> Investcorp</strong>'s talks to acquire <strong>AC Milan</strong>.
