  "text": "<p>Real-estate developers dominate China's international high-yield bond market, making up about 80% of its total $197 billion of debt outstanding, according to Goldman Sachs.</p><p>The market has already endured its worst selloff in a decade, after property giant China Evergrande Group skipped some interest payments to dollar bondholders in late September, and smaller rival Fantasia Holdings Group Co. defaulted on debt that matured in early October. Since then, at least four other Chinese developers have either defaulted or asked investors to wait longer for repayment.</p><p>A 30-day grace period for Evergrande to pay international bondholders, meanwhile, was going to run out this weekend. The company on Thursday sent $83.5 million in missed payments to the trustee for its dollar bonds, staving off a looming default.</p><p>The average yield on an ICE BofA index of Chinese high-yield corporate bonds stood at 20.3% Wednesday, after topping 23% last week.</p><p>At the height of the selloff on Oct. 13, the average price of bonds in the index had plunged 21% in just one month -- its worst performance since October 2011.</p><p>\"Global investors have been offloading high-yield bonds issued by Chinese developers because of the concerns that they have, rightly, about the future of those companies and their capability to repay debts,\" said Jing Sima, China strategist at BCA Research. \"The lack of response from Chinese policy makers definitely adds to that concern,\" she said.</p><p>While property bond prices have stabilized somewhat in recent days, many remain at distressed levels. The extreme market dislocation raises the risk of a vicious cycle, in which companies can't refinance coming debts because borrowing costs are too high, leading to more defaults and further hits to investors' and home buyers' confidence.</p><p>Some investors said they are now monitoring every pending interest and principal payment in the sector and asking chief financial officers if their companies will pay back debt as planned. \"We now need to track every single coupon and upcoming maturity,\" said Jim Veneau, head of fixed income for Asia at AXA Investment Managers.</p><p>On Wednesday, Chinese developer Modern Land (China) Co., which has a $250 million bond coming due on Oct. 25, said it is facing liquidity issues and is looking to hire a financial adviser. It scrapped an earlier plan to delay repaying most of the bond by three months.</p><p>Over the past week, China Properties Group Ltd. defaulted on $226 million in three-year notes that matured Oct. 15. And on Tuesday, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded Sinic Holdings (Group) Co. to a \"selective default\" rating, after the Shanghai company failed to repay $250 million of bonds that came due a day earlier.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
