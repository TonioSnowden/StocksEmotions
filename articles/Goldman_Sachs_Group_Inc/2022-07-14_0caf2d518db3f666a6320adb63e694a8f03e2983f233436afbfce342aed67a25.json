  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley cast a pall over Wall Street after reporting a bigger-than-expected decline in second-quarter profits that signalled the end of the industry's pandemic-era earnings boom. </p> <p>Wall Street banks raked in record fees during the coronavirus pandemic by working on a flood of mergers and acquisitions, public listings and special purpose acquisition companies. </p> <p>But the pipeline of business, in particular the flow of initial public offerings, has slowed markedly since the start of the year as investors have shied away from Spacs and money-losing start-ups. </p> <p>It was the first earnings miss from either JPMorgan — the largest US lender by assets and an industry bellwether — or <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/4169dc7c-0429-4bb6-855f-9cfb4353606b\">Morgan Stanley</a> since the start of 2020. </p> <p>“In terms of outlook [for investment banking], while our existing pipeline remains healthy, conversion of the deal backlog may be challenging if the current headwinds continue,” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/3de2fad0-44c8-492f-9b62-7e1374292a9e\">JPMorgan</a> chief financial officer Jeremy Barnum said in a call with analysts. </p> <p>The banks are also contending with a challenging regulatory environment. JPMorgan said it had “temporarily suspended share buybacks” after the Federal Reserve hit it last month with a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0cc4418-a16f-4e1a-9f84-b0dc6f4adbf0\">higher capital requirement</a>. </p> <p>And Morgan Stanley signalled it expected to pay a $200mn penalty to US regulators related to a federal investigation into the use of unapproved communication channels by its staff. JPMorgan <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3d39492-64a5-444e-9db6-d11537191664\">paid</a> that amount in fines to resolve a similar case. </p> <p>JPMorgan reported overall second-quarter net income of $8.2bn, or $2.76 per share, down nearly 30 per cent from $11.5bn, or $3.78 per share, in the same period last year. Analysts had forecast quarterly net income of $8.5bn, or $2.90 per share, according to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg.</p> <p>At Morgan Stanley net income applicable to shareholders also fell 30 per cent to $2.4bn, falling short of estimates for $2.75bn. </p> <p>Both banks suffered from larger declines in investment banking revenue than analysts had expected, as well as losses on loans they have not yet been able to sell on to third parties. </p> <p>The downbeat reports set a gloomy tone for the US bank earnings seasons, with Citigroup due to publish earnings on Friday followed by Goldman Sachs and Bank of America on Monday. </p> <p>JPMorgan's stock was down around 4.5 per cent in early afternoon trading in New York, while Morgan Stanley was down 0.6 per cent. Goldman was down by around 3 per cent and BofA fell by 2.8 per cent. </p> <p>During the quarter, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley took a hit because they were unable to sell debt they had underwritten to fund leveraged buyouts on to investors. </p> <p>JPMorgan said it had taken $257mm in markdowns on loans being held for sale while Morgan Stanley said it had taken $282mn of mark-to-market losses.</p> <p>For JPMorgan, the poor result in investment banking took the shine off a boost in the amount of money it generates from making loans, which has risen sharply as the Fed increases interest rates. </p> <p>The bank reported net interest income — the difference between what it pays on deposits and what it earns from loans and other assets — of $15.1bn. That was up 19 per cent year-on-year, the biggest such increase in more than a decade. </p> <p>JPMorgan lifted its target for net interest income for 2022, excluding its markets business, to more than $58bn, from more than <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9aca4ded-e5b7-4009-836b-6b2cf1a8f340\">$56bn previously</a>.</p> <p>Analysts at Wells Fargo said the JPMorgan earnings miss reflected Wall Street banking business that is partly mitigated by Main Street banking strength.</p> <p>JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley reported a jump in revenue at their trading divisions as investors traded heavily amid volatile financial markets. </p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin and Imani Moise in New York 2022 'JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley profit miss casts pall over Wall Street' FT.com 14 July.
