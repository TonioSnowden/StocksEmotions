  "title": "U.S. News:  Virus Disrupts Years of Health Progress  ---  Deaths from Covid-19  have inflated the U.S.'s  mortality rate and laid  bare broader problems  ----  By Jon Kamp, Brianna Abbott and Kara Dapena",
  "text": "<p>   Deaths from the Covid-19 pandemic are causing an extraordinary jolt in the U.S., inflating the nation's death rate to the highest level seen in nearly two decades. </p><p>   Whether the U.S. will quickly snap back to pre-pandemic levels following a mass-vaccination effort remains to be seen. Daily Covid-19 deaths are on their way back down, but the disease is unlikely to disappear, and health experts say there could also be long-running effects from issues like missed cancer screenings, a surging rate of drug overdoses and health inequities exacerbated by the pandemic. </p><p>   \"I imagine there will be lingering effects after 2021 just because this has taken such a toll on people's health, both directly and indirectly,\" said Noreen Goldman, professor of demography and public affairs at the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. </p><p>   The U.S.'s age-adjusted mortality rate shot up by about 16% in 2020 from the year before, according to provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a high point since 2003. This also broke a 90-year streak in which the yearly death rate was always lower than it was 10 years earlier. </p><p>   The age-adjusted mortality rate measures deaths in the U.S. per 100,000 people while taking into account age distribution of the population. </p><p>   On a yearly basis, 2020's death-rate surge was the biggest since the 1920s, when disease outbreaks often caused fluctuations, and the devastating 1918 flu pandemic before then. </p><p>   Suddenly, a communicable disease became the third-leading cause of death in 2020, trailing only heart disease and cancer. This is the highest level that deaths from infections have ranked in 83 years. </p><p>   Covid-19 vaccines are already tamping down U.S. infections and promise to restore some normalcy. Some researchers believe the death rate will return closer to pre-pandemic levels, perhaps as soon as next year, because it takes significant changes to shift trends in a nation of 330 million people. Yet health experts say Covid-19 may also cast a long shadow. </p><p>   \"There's no guarantee we get back to our baseline rates,\" said Derek Chapman, interim director at the Virginia Commonwealth University Center on Society and Health. </p><p>   As more people died during the pandemic, life expectancy fell, provisional CDC data show. In the first half of 2020, the agency estimated that U.S. life expectancy at birth had declined by about a year since 2019, to 77.8 years. The agency hasn't released full-year data, but the impact is expected to worsen. </p><p>   \"I expect it's likely two years or more once we add the rest of the data,\" said Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. The decrease will largely depend on the age patterns of deaths in the second half of last year, he said. </p><p>   CDC records back to 1900 show influenza, pneumonia and tuberculosis often ranking among the top causes of death early in the century. Improved hygiene and sanitation, treatments such as antibiotics and the widespread use of vaccines eventually drove down infections and deaths, and Americans began living longer. The focus started to shift to more chronic conditions such as heart disease and cancer. </p><p>   Dropping smoking rates, other prevention and new treatments helped improve Americans' health, and big swings in the mortality rate became more rare as deaths from infections generally became less common. The HIV epidemic significantly disrupted this trend when it emerged as a high-ranking cause of death in the 1980s and 1990s. </p><p>   The rate has historically trended lower over time, though it had stagnated in recent pre-pandemic years due to stalled progress against heart disease and surging drug-overdose deaths, among other factors. Uneven access to care in the U.S. also impedes progress, researchers say. </p><p>   Then came Covid-19, which the CDC has linked to about 384,000 deaths in the U.S. last year, and which took an even steeper toll when accounting for excess deaths, or deaths that exceeded averages from recent years. </p><p>   A combination of deaths that weren't properly attributed to Covid-19, plus collateral damage from issues like people avoiding hospital trips for other health problems, are part of the pandemic's true toll, researchers say. As with known Covid-19 deaths, the surge in excess deaths has hit communities of color particularly hard. </p><p>   According to CDC data, about 1 in 3 deaths among Hispanic people in 2020 were excess deaths, or those exceeding recent averages. About 1 in 4 deaths among Black people were excess, and about 1 in 8 among white people were excess. </p><p>   Marc Gourevitch, who chairs the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone Health, says the nation could continue to struggle with widened health inequities that Covid-19 inflamed beyond the pandemic. </p><p>   \"I think it's quite possible we will see an enduring, measurable impact from Covid on age-adjusted mortality and life expectancy,\" Dr. Gourevitch said. </p><p>   While the CDC has thus far measured a decline of a year across the population, Black men lost three years, pulling their life expectancy at birth down to 68 years, the CDC said. For white women, the loss was 0.7 year, pulling life expectancy to less than 81. </p><p>   The pandemic's enduring effects could include health implications for those who lost their jobs, or complications for people who weren't able to care for their chronic medical problems. </p><p>   New survey data from the American Diabetes Association show nearly a quarter of adults with diabetes reported challenges managing their blood glucose during the pandemic, and 17% reported developing new complications such as high blood pressure and heart problems. </p><p></p>",
