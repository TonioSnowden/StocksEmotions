  "text": "<p>Shares of Delta Air Lines jumped 6% in premarket trading after it reported a quarterly loss, but said it returned to profitability in March and expects to report a profit in the second quarter. JPMorgan Chase declined 3.6% after it posted first-quarter profit that came in below Wall Street's estimates.</p><p>Retailer Bed Bath &amp; Beyond fell 10% after it reported a quarterly loss, saying it was hit by supply chain disruptions.</p><p>Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are set to report earnings on Thursday.</p><p>Stocks have come under pressure in recent days as concerns about inflation drove uncertainty about how aggressively the Federal Reserve could act to temper it. A data release on Tuesday showed that consumer prices accelerated further in March, rising 8.5% from a year earlier. The monthly increase was in line with economists' expectations and core inflation which excludes food and energy was slightly lower than predicted, according to Deutsche Bank.</p><p>\"The inflation data was obviously not great, but maybe we're around the peak and we'll start to see something of a disinflationary trend over the coming months,\" said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank. \"With bank earnings kicking off, we can get some direction. It's really going to be about the guidance that we get for the rest of the year.\"</p><p>The U.S. producer price index, another gauge of inflation, rose by 11.2% in March compared with a year ago, coming in above expectations.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged up to 2.742%, compared with 2.724% on Tuesday, resuming its march upwards after declining the day before. Yields rise when prices fall.</p><p>Oil prices rose, with global benchmark Brent crude adding 1.7% to trade at $106.40 a barrel. Traders are assessing energy demand in China, as some lockdown measures in Shanghai eased but more factories in the region, including two run by Apple suppliers, halted production.</p><p>Further disruptions to energy supplies are expected, according to the International Energy Agency. It said on Wednesday that oil output from Russia was likely to fall by nearly 3 million barrels a day from May, a bigger decline than other analysts had predicted.</p><p>Pharmaceutical firm Antares Pharma surged 49% in premarket trading after The Wall Street Journal reported that Halozyme Therapeutics was nearing a deal to buy the company for around $960 million. Shares of Halozyme slid 0.8%.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.5%. British supermarket chain Tesco declined 4.4% after it said it expects lower profit as rising prices change shoppers' habits.</p><p>European government bonds sold off with the benchmark German 10-year bond yield rising to 0.859% before easing moderately. The European Central Bank is meeting on Thursday and investors are awaiting more clarity on plans to curb stimulus measures.</p><p>\"ECB speakers have turned a little bit more hawkish lately,\" said Jeremy Gatto, a multiasset investment manager at Unigestion. \"They seem now to be agreeing that inflation might be a concern. It's difficult to get excited about Europe.\"</p><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that peace talks had reached a dead end and that his forces would continue their offensive in Ukraine.</p><p>In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ticked up 0.3%.</p><p>Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 1.9%. The yen depreciated 0.4% against the dollar, reaching a 20-year low.
