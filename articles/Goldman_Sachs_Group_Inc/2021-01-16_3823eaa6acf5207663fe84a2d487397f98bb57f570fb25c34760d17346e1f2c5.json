  "title": "U.S. News -- Capital Account: Biden Borrows to Battle Income Inequality",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Biden proposed raising the child tax credit 50% to $3,000 or more for the year and making it refundable, meaning families who owe less tax than the credit would get a check for the difference. He would extend and boost enhanced weekly unemployment insurance benefits by $100 from the $300 in December's stimulus package to $400. He would extend a 15% increase in food stamps through the summer, raise the maximum earned-income tax credit for childless adults by nearly $1,000 and extend it to more people.</p><p>Those steps, plus adding $1,400 to the $600-per-adult checks approved in December, would slash the poverty rate from 12.6% to 9%, or by more than 11 million people, according to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University. The number of children in poverty would drop by half, or five million.</p><p>Then there's the macroeconomic impact. If Mr. Biden's proposal is enacted, it would, along with $900 billion in December and previous measures, add $5.3 trillion to deficits, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. That's a staggering 25% of gross domestic product.</p><p>Though the economy is in bad shape, it may not need help on the scale Mr. Biden is proposing. GDP is now about 3%, or $700 billion annualized, below its normal, potential level, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The last round of stimulus could eliminate most of that gap, weakening the macroeconomic case for more.</p><p>If Congress passes stimulus close to what Mr. Biden proposes, it could supercharge an economy already poised to rebound once enough of the population is vaccinated to let the economy reopen.</p><p>After Democrats won control of the Senate this month, Goldman Sachs forecast the economy would grow 6.6% this year, the fastest since 1983 -- and that assumed less stimulus than Mr. Biden just proposed. Goldman foresaw unemployment falling to 4.8% at the end of this year from 6.7% in December and 14.8% in April. It took nearly seven years to reach that level after the 2007-09 recession and four years after the 2001 recession, from much lower peaks.</p><p>When unemployment heads toward 4%, the Federal Reserve typically starts to raise interest rates to keep the economy from overheating and pushing up inflation. But the Fed has broken with that pattern: It plans to keep interest rates near zero until inflation has hit 2% and unemployment is down to around 4%, which could take several years.</p><p>As speculation of a new fiscal boost grew in recent days, markets began wondering if the Fed would stick with the plan. On Thursday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said it would: \"Now is not the time to be talking about exit. The economy is far from our goals.\" The economy is thus about to be administered an unprecedented combination of ultra-easy monetary policy and massive fiscal stimulus.</p><p>As unemployment dropped below 5% in the last expansion, job opportunities expanded for long disadvantaged groups, including racial minorities, people with disabilities and people with criminal records. Wages began growing more rapidly, especially for low-end workers.</p><p>The pandemic largely undid that progress: It disproportionately hurt those same workers, many of whom work in industries requiring physical presence such as hotels and restaurants. The risk is that as unemployment drags on, those workers will struggle to find new work at their old pay levels. A rapid return to below 5% unemployment could avert that.</p><p>Still, that wouldn't come cheaply. Mr. Biden would push the national debt well over 100% of GDP, perhaps to a historic high. Yet parts of his plan -- as outlined -- aren't well targeted either to reduce unemployment or help the needy. Boosting stimulus checks to $2,000 per adult from $600 will cost an estimated $464 billion. But 58% of the money will go to households earning more than $50,000, including some earning more than $200,000, according to the Tax Policy Center, a think tank. Most of these households aren't holding back on spending because they have no cash, but because of Covid-19 restrictions. The $350 billion Mr. Biden proposes for state and local governments is much more than the revenue hit they have sustained.</p><p>Moreover, for provisions such as the expanded child tax credit to have a lasting impact on inequality, they have to become permanent. Mr. Biden said when that time comes, he will propose the necessary taxes. Until then, he's not apologizing for big deficits: \"A growing chorus of top economists agree that, in this moment of crisis, with interest rates at historic lows, we cannot afford inaction.\"</p>",
