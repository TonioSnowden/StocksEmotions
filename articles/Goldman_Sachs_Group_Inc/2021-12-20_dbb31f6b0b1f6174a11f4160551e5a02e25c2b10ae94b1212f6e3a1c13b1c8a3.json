  "text": "<p>How are stock-index futures trading?</p><p>S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 fell 52 points, or 1.1%, to 4,558.50.</p><p>Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 dropped 361 points, or 1%, to 34,901.</p><p>Nasdaq-100 futures NQ00 declined 197.75 points, or 1.3%, to reach 15,585.</p><p>On Friday, the Dow DJIA dropped more than 500 points, or 1.5%, with the S&amp;P 500 SPX and Nasdaq Composite COMP following it lower. For the week, the Dow lost 1.7%, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.9% and the Nasdaq tumbled 3%.</p><p>What's driving the markets?</p><p>As omicron worries and related lockdowns in parts of Europe weighed on investors, news that President Joe Biden's signature $2 trillion spending plan appeared doomed was being greeted with selling.</p><p>Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said on Sunday that he cannot support it — potentially handing Biden and Democrats a major political loss.</p><p>Goldman Sachs downgraded their U.S. growth forecasts for 2022, citing difficulties in getting the spending bill passed.</p><p>Last week's losses came as investors weighed the Federal Reserve's hawkish pivot, speeding up its reduction of monthly bond purchases and predicting three interest-rate hikes next year.</p><p>“With flight to safety being the overriding concern, lower bond yields are questioning the FOMC's ability to act as hawkish as they signaled last week. Markets are being challenged by a range of uncertainties at a time where thinner trading volumes ahead of the holiday period can exacerbate price swings,” said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank, in a note to clients.</p><p>Meanwhile, new COVID-19 cases are growing sharply in many parts of the world, fueled by the rapid spread of omicron. Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that he expects record cases of COVID-19 this winter, and urged people to get vaccinated and get boosters. The Netherlands began a lockdown that will last until mid-January and the U.K. hasn't ruled out tighter pre-Christmas restrictions.</p><p>Oil prices also sank, with front-month West Texas intermediate crude CL. 1 falling $2.82 a barrel, and Brent crude BRN00, the global benchmark, similarly off.</p><p>Wall Street has a shortened week coming up, with markets closed Friday for the Christmas holiday.</p>",
