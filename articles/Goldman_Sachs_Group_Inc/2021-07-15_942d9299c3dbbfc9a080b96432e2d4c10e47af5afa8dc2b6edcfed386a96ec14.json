  "title": "Apparel Brand Fabletics  Taps Banks to Help IPO  ----  By Cara Lombardo and Corrie Driebusch",
  "text": "<p>   Fabletics, the workout-apparel brand backed by actress Kate Hudson, has tapped banks to help it prepare for an initial public offering it hopes would value it at more than $5 billion, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   Fabletics, owned by TechStyle Fashion Group, recently selected Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Barclays Plc and Bank of America Corp. for its IPO and is aiming to raise around $500 million in an offering, they said. </p><p>   Fabletics was founded in 2013 by Adam Goldenberg and Don Ressler, who partnered with Ms. Hudson and feature her prominently in its advertisements. It aims to fill a gap in the market between high-end brands such as Lululemon and the cheapest brands. </p><p>   Members pay a monthly fee that goes toward purchases of clothing, or can skip a month. Its products include color-coordinated workout tops and bottoms, sports bras and other accessories. The brand also gives members access to a workout app. </p><p>   The IPO market has been on a tear and investors have been especially receptive to consumer-facing companies, including healthcare-apparel startup Figs Inc. The scrubs-maker began trading in May and has a roughly $6 billion valuation, and its stock remains above its IPO price even after shares have tumbled. Trendy oatmilk company Oatly Group AB made its debut at a valuation of roughly $10 billion. </p><p>   Though its shares have fallen recently, its stock still sits more than 15% above its IPO price. Plus-size retailer Torrid Holdings Inc. made its stock-market debut this month, with shares rising in their first day of trading. They remain above their IPO price. </p><p>   Other consumer brands also exploring IPOs this year include trendy shoemaker Allbirds Inc. and eyeglass manufacturer Warby Parker Inc., people familiar with the matter said. </p><p></p>",
