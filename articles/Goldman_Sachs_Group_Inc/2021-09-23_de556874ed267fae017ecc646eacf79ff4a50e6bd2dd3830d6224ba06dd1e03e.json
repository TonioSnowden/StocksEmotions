Only <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>'s <strong>Lloyd Blankfein </strong>decided to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0bdafe4e-89b3-11e8-b18d-0181731a0340\">leave of his own volition</a> when he handed the reins to <strong>David Solomon</strong> in 2018 after 12 years in the top job. Picking the right time to go can be a challenge, he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4814a8ca-57a2-43f1-a6da-f126a4254f6d\">told</a> the FT's Joshua Franklin and Imani Moise.&#xa0;</p> <p>“When things are going well you don't want to leave but when things are going poorly you feel you can't leave,” Blankfein said. “You have to have discipline to leave when you don't want to leave.”</p> <h2>What a potential restructuring of Evergrande could look like</h2> <p>Yesterday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ef786d6-6b6a-45b5-ae19-1c377f4c9e90\">we dove into</a> the liquidity crisis at the Chinese real estate giant<strong> Evergrande,</strong> which has the potential to spark the biggest debt restructuring in China's history.</p> <p>Investors were left in the dark this week as to whether the central government would step in to contain the explosion or allow the ailing property developer to fail as a cautionary tale for China's debt-laden real estate sector.</p> <p>Evergrande offered anxious shareholders and creditors an inkling of faith on Wednesday by announcing it had “resolved” interest payments for an onshore bond due on Thursday.</p> <p>But the company failed to specify<em> when</em> it would make the payments. It also has a $83.5m payment due on Thursday on its US dollar bonds, which it hasn't yet addressed.</p> <p>Questions still loom as to what a potential restructuring could look like, many of which the FT's Thomas Hale, Edward White and Sun Yu have addressed in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a29e6b20-9d01-43c1-a7d9-77abbacf5e9a\">this explainer</a>.</p> <p>Any measures taken by Beijing to curb collateral economic damage will probably favour Evergrande's onshore bondholders, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e099e0e3-4fba-45a4-92e2-08891c2f8b0e\">embittered retail investors</a> and the majority state-owned banks residing within its financial system.</p> <p>Downplaying fears that the crisis could spread globally, the famed short seller <strong>Jim Chanos </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0bf52d39-fd42-408f-aa85-52a4135de312\">told the FT</a> he believes China could now be confronting a “far worse” situation within its own borders.</p> <p>“If you try to deflate this bubble, it is fraught with risks,” he warned.&#xa0;</p> <p>A default could ricochet through the broader Asian corporate debt market in a blow to China's property-driven growth model, the rumblings of which have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1a52335-be92-4191-a87e-2c0b9e5fd65d\">already begun</a> to be felt by the market as domestic banks <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/China-debt-crunch/Chinese-banks-brace-for-losses-as-Evergrande-reckoning-looms\">brace for losses</a>.</p> <p>As for the yield-hungry <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0c71c66-b386-4f3c-8796-4384e7378a56\">offshore bondholders</a> such as <strong>Ashmore</strong>, <strong>BlackRock</strong>, <strong>UBS</strong> and <strong>HSBC</strong> that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ef786d6-6b6a-45b5-ae19-1c377f4c9e90\">boosted their bond holdings</a> in Evergrande ahead of the crisis . . . well, they're just not top priority right now.</p> <h2>Netflix's golden ticket to the Ronald Dahl universe</h2> <p>Much like a stroll through Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, a scroll through <strong>Netflix</strong>'s content library hints at infinite possibility.</p> <p>By <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2067f6f-1e39-4dc1-9ef3-9daf82c4c416\">acquiring</a> the works of the late children's author <strong>Roald Dahl</strong> for about £500m, the streaming giant has procured a golden egg that hatches profits in more ways than one.</p> <p>Not only will Netflix gain the rights to classics such as <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em>, <em>Matilda</em> and <em>The Witches</em>, it will also become an “underlying” rights holder with the power to develop Dahl's creations in other formats, promising a “unique universe” across film, television, publishing and more.</p> <p>The deal is the first of its kind for the video streaming group, which is fighting to defend <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08ea275c-ddd1-4121-b26b-8d6eb57c7cae\">its position</a> as the world's most popular streaming service against <strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>HBO</strong>, <strong>Disney</strong> and other rivals in the endless <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c11245a2-7b5f-4780-bb8a-03d0e8a3862c\">battle for subscribers</a>.</p> <p>Unlike Amazon, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97d2edb8-355c-4af0-9f00-8b0a65d818f1\">is buying</a> <strong>MGM Studios</strong> for $8.45bn, and Disney, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aef7357e-e1b2-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce\">purchased</a> <strong>21st Century Fox</strong> for $71bn in 2019, Netflix lacks a studio of its own. Acquiring the Dahl library could be the start of a new strategy to stockpile exclusive content.</p> <p>The deal is unlikely to generate the kind of pay-off Disney has seen with its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07c7233c-9633-11de-84d1-00144feabdc0\">$4bn purchase</a> of <strong>Marvel</strong> in 2009, however, as the FT's Lex column <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6b0ce91-3283-4d5a-9229-92fbcc39af9b\">points out</a>, as movie rights to six Dahl works have been licensed out to other studios, leaving Netflix with the production of mostly animated and live-action TV shows.</p> <p>The <strong>Roald Dahl Story Company</strong>, which apologised for anti-Semitic comments made by the late author, said a “significant part” of the proceeds would be used to establish a charitable trust that would focus on “children's health, anti-hate and anti-racism”.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Facebook</strong> technology chief <strong>Mike Schroepfer</strong> will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad123117-483c-40e0-ad25-99a77ee80c6d\">step down</a> next year after 13 years at the company. He will be replaced by longtime Facebook executive <strong>Andrew Bosworth</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Slaughter and May</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea30c81d-ca47-4245-8484-698a721d8aa0\">has elected</a> <strong>Deborah Finkle </strong>as its first female managing partner. She will take over from practice partner<strong> David Wittmann </strong>and executive partner <strong>Paul Stacey </strong>when they retire in May.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Nomura </strong>has appointed <strong>Jeff McDermott </strong>as a senior managing director and global co-head of investment banking, based in New York. He was previously joint head of investment banking at <strong>UBS</strong> before founding <strong>Greentech Capital Advisors</strong>, which was acquired by Nomura in April last year.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Mike Manley</strong>, the North America chief executive of <strong>Stellantis</strong> (formed through a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d11705e-8d00-4707-80b8-a667a0a16d13\">merger</a> of France's <strong>PSA </strong>and <strong>Fiat Chrysler</strong> in January) will <a href=\"https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/stellantis-executive-management-change/\">leave his role</a> on November 1 to become CEO of the Florida-based vehicle retailer <strong>AutoNation</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Värde Partners</strong> has promoted <strong>Shannon Gallagher</strong> and <strong>Mona Girotra</strong> to global co-heads of its business development and investor relations group, based in London and New York, respectively.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Dealmaking drought </strong>The pandemic has supercharged banking mergers and acquisitions as scale becomes integral to competing with Wall Street goliaths. But the majority of large regional lenders have already formed alliances and smaller players may get left behind altogether.
