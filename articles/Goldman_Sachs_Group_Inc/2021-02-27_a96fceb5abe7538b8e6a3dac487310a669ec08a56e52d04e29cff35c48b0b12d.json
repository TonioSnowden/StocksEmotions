  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Fund CEO Quits After Vaccine Trip To U.A.E.",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Machin, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. investment banker for two decades, made the trip despite Canadian government advice against travel during the pandemic and amid one of the West's slowest vaccine rollouts.</p><p>CPPIB is a crown corporation, meaning it is governed independently from the federal government but is the steward of pension obligations that are government-mandated. Board members are selected by the ministry of finance. Katherine Cuplinskas, a spokeswoman for Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland, said the minister spoke to CPPIB's board of directors Thursday night about Mr. Machin's trip to make \"clear that Canadians place their trust in the CPPIB and expect it to be held to a higher standard.\"</p><p>\"We are very disappointed by this troubling situation and we support the swift action taken by the Board of Directors,\" Ms. Cuplinskas said.</p><p>Mr. Machin didn't comment when reached by phone by The Wall Street Journal on Friday. A spokesman for the CPPIB didn't respond to requests to comment.</p><p>Mr. Machin's trip was a surprise to many inside the pension fund and his resignation added to a feeling of shock, according to a person familiar with the matter. The global nature of the fund's workforce caused a domino effect of calls and emails. The pension fund had more than 1,800 employees in nine offices, from Toronto to New York to London and Mumbai, as of mid-2020. Many of those employees are still working from home.</p><p>On Thursday, the Journal reported that Mr. Machin, 54 years old, got a Covid-19 vaccine shot in the U.A.E., ahead of millions of Canadians waiting on one at home.</p><p>There is no evidence Mr. Machin, a British citizen, broke any laws. The Canadian government has urged residents to avoid overseas travel, but hasn't banned it. The U.A.E., meanwhile, has said it is distributing vaccines to residents, a designation that foreigners can obtain through activities such as investing, buying property or starting a local company. There is no evidence Mr. Machin is a resident.</p><p>The U.A.E. has made exceptions to its residency requirements. In January, the U.A.E.-sponsored cycling team that won the 2020 Tour de France -- a group of around 60 mostly nonresident cyclists and staff -- received doses of a Chinese-made vaccine in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>The U.A.E., a federation of seven emirates that includes the commercial hub of Dubai, has outpaced almost every country in the world with an ambitious vaccination campaign.</p><p>As head of the CPPIB, Mr. Machin was responsible for overseeing money set aside for retirement for roughly 20 million Canadians who contribute to the country's public pension plan. The Canadian fund in March 2020 held stakes in several U.A.E. companies including Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC and Emirates Telecommunications Group Co. PJSC, according to the fund's annual disclosures of foreign stockholdings. Last year, the fund invested in the $5.4 billion stock debut of Kuaishou Technology, a Chinese video-streaming startup, alongside the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, a big U.A.E. sovereign-wealth fund.</p><p>Mr. Machin's vaccination comes amid furor in other parts of the world over instances in which rich or well-connected people have been able to jump the line for a vaccine. Most of the world is carefully meting out doses to prioritize the most vulnerable, or those on the front lines fighting the pandemic.</p><p>In Peru, dozens of government consultants, lobbyists, cabinet ministers and people connected to them, and the former president and his family, secretly received vaccines last year -- triggering a scandal there now dubbed Vaccine Gate. Last month, Florida restricted vaccines to those who could show proof of residency. Officials there offered the shot to anyone over 65 years old but grew concerned the state was becoming a draw for vaccine tourism. Many Canadians, in particular, have been looking to charter jets for quick round trips to Florida for vaccines.</p><p>Vaccines are particularly scarce in Canada. About 4% of the Canadian population has received at least one dose, compared with 20% in the U.S., according to a University of Oxford tracker.</p><p>Mr. Machin has been the Toronto-based pension fund's top executive since June 2016. He previously oversaw its international operations. Before his finance career, he qualified as a medical doctor in the U.K.</p>",
