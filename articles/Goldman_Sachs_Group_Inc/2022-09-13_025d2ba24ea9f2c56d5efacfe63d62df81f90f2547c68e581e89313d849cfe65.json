  "title": "Goldman to Cut Hundreds  Of Jobs Following Reviews  ----  By Charley Grant",
  "text": "<p>    Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is preparing to lay off hundreds of staffers as soon as next week. </p><p>   The job cuts are part of the bank's annual performance reviews that had been suspended during the pandemic, according to a person familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Goldman reinstated those reviews this year following a slump in Wall Street deal-making activity. Goldman had 47,000 employees on staff at the end of June, up from 41,000 a year earlier. </p><p>   The New York Times earlier reported on the impending layoffs. </p><p>   After a record-setting 2021, the industrywide slump in mergers and new initial public offerings has hit Goldman's bottom line this year. Second-quarter investment-banking revenue fell 41% from a year ago, and Goldman's profit fell by nearly half in that period. </p><p>   Chief Financial Officer Denis Coleman said at the time that the bank would slow its pace of hiring and would be slower to replace departing staff as a result of economic uncertainty. </p><p>   \"There's no question that economic conditions are tightening to try to control inflation, and as economic conditions tighten, it will have a bigger impact on corporate confidence and also consumer activity in the economy,\" Chief Executive David Solomon said on a conference call with analysts in July. \"I think it's hard to gauge exactly how that will play out, and so I think it's prudent for us to be cautious.\" </p><p></p>",
