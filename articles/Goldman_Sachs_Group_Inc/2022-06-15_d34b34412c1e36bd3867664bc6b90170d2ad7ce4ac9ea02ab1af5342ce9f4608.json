The latter would mark the biggest such increase in nearly 30 years.</p><p>Surprisingly strong May consumer-price inflation data released last week, struck a blow to those hoping that price rises had peaked. It also sparked a fresh rout for stock markets and other assets, pushing the S&amp;P 500 index into bear-market territory, amid concerns more aggressive Fed action would drive the U.S. into a recession.</p><p>\"If the Fed surprises with a 50bp hike, the market will certainly rebound on relief. But the Fed's primary goal is to tame inflation right now, and not to boost the equity markets. And depressed market conditions seem necessary in achieving that goal,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, in a note to clients.</p><p>\"Now that the 75bp pill has been swallowed by the market, it would be irrational for the Fed not to go ahead with a bigger hike,\" she said.</p><p>Not everyone is convinced investors would be relieved by a half-point move.</p><p>A 50 basis point move, in theory, should cause a rally in stocks, \"but this is genuinely unclear,\" said Chris Weston, head of research at Pepperstone in Australia. \"The market could easily see a risk that the Fed is falling further behind the inflation curve and going into further risk aversion mode.\"</p><p>Read: A 75-basis-point hike?
