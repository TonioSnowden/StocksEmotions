Mr. Niedermayer in September was appointed to the role of president of Fitch's solutions business, which provides global market insights.</p><p>Unlike its publicly traded rivals S&amp;P Global Inc. and Moody's Corp., Fitch is privately owned. Media conglomerate Hearst Corp. first bought an interest in the company in 2006. It increased its stake to 80% in 2015 and ultimately purchased the remaining 20% stake in 2018, for $2.8 billion.</p><p>Fitch in recent years has been working to diversify its business model beyond credit ratings. The company in 2018 acquired Fulcrum Financial Data, a provider of leveraged finance and distressed debt analysis, followed by the 2021 acquisition of credit research firm CreditSights.</p><p>\"Tracey will play a key role in ensuring that Fitch continues to grow its business, building on the strong success we have experienced over the past 20 years,\" Fitch Chief Executive Paul Taylor said.</p><p>Write to Jennifer Williams-Alvarez at Jennifer.Williams-Alvarez@wsj.com</p><p>Fitch Group Appoints Goldman Sachs Veteran as CFO</p>",
