  "text": "<p>“The lack of upside impetus also suggests that a lot of today's risk off moves are being driven by a lack of liquidity, more than any undue pessimism about future economic prospects,” wrote Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, in a daily note.</p><p>Many global markets will be closed on Friday in observance of Christmas.</p><p>The declines for gold came even as Goldman Sachs cut its U.S. growth forecast again, citing Democratic Sen.
