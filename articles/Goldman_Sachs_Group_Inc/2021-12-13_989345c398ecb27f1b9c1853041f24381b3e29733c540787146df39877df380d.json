  "text": "<p>Volvo Cars and Northvolt hope to take their $3bn battery partnership to the US and Asia as the Swedish groups aim to get a head-start on rivals while traditional carmakers step up their moves into electric vehicles.</p> <p>The newly listed premium carmaker and its start-up partner, which are about to open Europe's first “gigafactory”, <a href=\"https://northvolt.com/articles/volvo-northvolt-dec2021/\">announced</a> on Friday that they would set up a joint research and development centre in Gothenburg as part of a SKr30bn ($3.3bn) investment, which will include another <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/053ae1cc-993d-45e1-8f80-e1a758a7a38e\">factory in Europe</a> to start production by 2026.</p> <p>“If we can be faster working together than the competition, then we want to use that, not just in Europe but also in the Americas and Asia,” said Hakan Samuelsson, Volvo chief executive. “There's nothing in our agreement that limits us to Europe. Europe is where we start but of course we make cars globally.” </p> <p>Volvo, whose shares have risen by a third since its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3cb197f-7567-474a-aca1-bc1e4cb597cb\">IPO</a> in October, has some of the most advanced electrification plans of any traditional carmaker, aiming for 100 per cent electric cars by 2030 from its current 3 per cent.</p> <p>Northvolt, which is backed by the likes of Goldman Sachs, BMW and Ikea, is the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f38e947-b680-45f4-8f0a-d5ae1f9c3ea9\">most advanced</a> of a series of battery start-ups in Europe. It will open its first factory in northern Sweden this month, and has an extensive partnership with German carmaker Volkswagen.</p> <p>Northvolt had long limited its ambitions to Europe as the continent aims to enter a battery race dominated by Asian companies and Tesla in the US. But Peter Carlsson, a former Tesla executive who now runs Northvolt, told the Financial Times in June when first unveiling the partnership with Volvo that it was looking at the US and Asia.</p> <p>Volvo has plants in China — home to its main shareholder Zhejiang Geely — and the US, along with Sweden and Belgium.</p> <p>Carlsson said: “We've been up till now very much focused on Europe. The customer base, the trend, the growth in Europe — these have been fast enough and sufficient for anything we can cope with.” He added that, as carmakers' platforms were global, “it's a natural development” to look at Asia and the US. </p> <p>Samuelsson stressed that he believed it would be a critical competitive advantage for carmakers to have their own expertise in electric car batteries, just as it had been in combustion engines.</p> <p>“How fast you can charge the car, how long you can drive it for — of course, these will be decisive in the future . . . Yes, the competence in batteries will be decisive for car competitiveness,” he said, adding that in future battery cells may be assembled directly into the vehicle structure rather than in cylinders.</p> <p>Volvo and Northvolt will announce at the start of next year the location for their European battery factory, which will produce enough batteries for about 500,000 cars, with construction due to start in 2023. Samuelsson said they were examining locations in Sweden and elsewhere in Europe with energy supply, logistics and availability of skilled labour all important factors.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/69084b66-3723-4d33-af7b-e593fda81107.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Richard Milne, Nordic and Baltic Correspondent 2021 'Volvo Cars and Northvolt seek to take $3bn battery venture to US and Asia' FT.com 13 December.
