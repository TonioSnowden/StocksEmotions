  "text": "<p>Fenway Sports Group, the owners of Liverpool Football Club and the Boston Red Sox baseball team, is set to buy the National Hockey League's Pittsburgh Penguins in a deal valuing the franchise at more than $850m, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>The addition of the five-time Stanley Cup champions would extend the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c01749e7-3462-4f5f-bc91-a9f95a96f00c\">growing sports empire of FSG</a>, helmed by commodities trading billionaire John Henry, as franchise owners increasingly look to amass holdings in a variety of sports on both sides of the Atlantic. </p> <p>The deal was expected to be approved as soon as Thursday, one of these people said. FSG declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Penguins did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>The prospective acquisition comes just months after basketball star LeBron James and former Goldman Sachs banker Gerry Cardinale's RedBird Capital took a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b17ded95-3d07-46d7-a7db-448de79b4b66\">minority stake</a> in FSG.</p> <p>That placed the enterprise value of the Liverpool FC and Boston Red Sox ownership vehicle at $7.35bn. Fenway accepted the minority investment so that it could make acquisitions and expand its portfolio of sports team holdings.</p> <p>Global investors have targeted sports teams as investments due to the increasing value of television rights and the ability to monetise branding and advertising revenue streams.</p> <p>In addition to outright sales, private investment firms like Dyal Capital Partners and Arctos Sports Partners have set up multibillion-dollar vehicles to buy minority stakes in teams, which has helped prop up overall valuations and opened existing owners and leagues to fresh capital.</p> <p>For the Penguins, the sale could mark the end of a successful two-decade-plus ownership by Beverly Hills-based investor Ron Burkle and Penguins Hall of Fame centre Mario Lemieux. The duo rescued the Penguins from bankruptcy in 1999, paying a reported $107m for the then ailing team and turning round its fortunes. It is unclear what continuing stake the pair may have in the franchise under an FSG purchase.</p> <p>During their ownership, the Penguins have become one of the NHL's most successful teams, winning the league's championship trophy, the Stanley Cup, in 2009, 2016 and 2017. Much of the team's success has come from drafting superstars Evgeni Malkin and Sidney Crosby in 2004 and 2005 respectively, both of whom have played their entire careers with the Penguins.</p> <p>The rising valuation of the franchise comes as the NHL enters the first year of a record TV deal. In March, it struck a seven-year broadcast deal with ESPN for a reported $400m annually, and a month later revealed a similar length deal with Turner Sports, paying $225m to air the Stanley Cup playoffs and the Winter Classic outdoor match. </p><p>Source: Arash Massoudi in London, Sara Germano and Antoine Gara in New York 2021 'Pittsburgh Penguins valued at more than $850m in Fenway Sports deal' FT.com 17 November.
