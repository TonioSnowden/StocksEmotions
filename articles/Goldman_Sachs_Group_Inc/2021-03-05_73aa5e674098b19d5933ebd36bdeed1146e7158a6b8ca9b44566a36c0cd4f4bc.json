  "text": "<p>Companies have issued a record amount of convertible debt since the start of the year, rushing to lock in rock-bottom interest rates in case recent wobbles in stock and bond markets dent investor enthusiasm.</p> <p>Convertible bonds come with the right to swap the debt for shares in the issuing company at a pre-agreed price, making them a hybrid instrument sensitive to the outlook for both markets. </p> <p>Airbnb on Tuesday announced a $2bn convertible deal, the biggest of the year so far, on the heels of Twitter, which announced a $1.25bn convertible bond issue on Monday and Spotify, which priced $1.3bn in notes last week. Beyond Meat increased the size of a convertible bond issue on Tuesday from $750m to $1bn.</p> <p>All four companies will pay no interest at all on the debt, and investors agreed to conversion prices at hefty premiums to current share prices — ranging from 47.5 per cent in the case of Beyond Meat to 70 per cent at Spotify. For companies, a higher premium means less dilution for existing shareholders if the debt converts; for investors, it means the option to convert is more likely to prove worthless.</p> <p>“We've never seen pricing like this ever in the convertible market,” said Michael Voris, head of convertible bond financing at Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>The low interest rate environment, coupled with high equity valuations and high volatility in markets amounts to a “triumvirate” that leads to “very attractive convertible pricing”, he said.</p> <p>The favourable conditions have fuelled the busiest start to a year since Refinitiv started tracking global convertible bond proceeds in 1980. In January and February, companies raised just shy of $34bn, 68 per cent more than in the first two months of last year.</p> <p>In the US, which accounted for most of the deals, issuers were largely split into two categories: high-growth companies, particularly in the tech sector, and companies that have been hard hit by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus\">pandemic</a>, which have been using convertible debt to repair their balance sheets. The latter category included Expedia, the travel agent, which used the proceeds from its $900m offering last month to buy back existing bonds on which it was paying a higher interest rate. </p> <p>Companies say investor enthusiasm for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/f629ead0-d40f-43ba-b104-95b1e02fe174\">convertible bonds</a> has allowed them to raise more than they could elsewhere in the credit markets.</p> <p>BridgeBio, a biotech start-up, raised $750m in convertible debt in January. “If we'd gone to the senior secured market, I think we probably could have found an additional couple-hundred million dollars of debt,” said Brian Stephenson, its chief financial officer. “It's just a different order of magnitude.”</p> <p>And zero-coupon debt would be hard to find outside of the convertible debt market.</p> <p>“If we were to look at a more traditional term loan, like we had with our prior facility, the interest rate associated with that was much higher,” said Kyle Wailes, chief financial officer at SmileDirectClub, a retailer of teeth straighteners, which issued $650m in convertible bonds a month ago.</p> <p>But the window for the rosy deals may be closing. The US stock market has wiped out almost all its gains for the year and the tech-heavy Nasdaq is down more than 10 per cent from its peak — declines tied to the recent rise in long-term interest rates.</p> <p>“If equity markets declined significantly, then companies will be a little more careful about their . . . willingness to issue converts,” said Venu Krishna, deputy head of US equity research at Barclays, citing the higher equity dilution implied by lower share prices.</p> <p>Companies should take a “very, very close look” at the convertible market now, said Voris of Goldman Sachs. “A year from now, coupons could be 1 per cent. Interest rates could be higher.”</p><p>Source: Aziza Kasumov in New York 2021 'Companies rush to issue convertible debt at rock-bottom rates ' FT.com 5 March.
