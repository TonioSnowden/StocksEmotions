  "text": "<p>America's biggest banks report earnings this week against the backdrop of an improving US economy and with investors already having chased their shares higher in anticipation of strong results.</p> <p>Bank stocks are now trading at about twice their pandemic lows and have risen 26 per cent year to date, outpacing the 11 per cent gain in the S&amp;P 500. Many investors have gone from wondering how bad the pandemic fallout will be, to asking how far the industry has to run.&#xa0;</p> <p>“[JPMorgan Chase chief executive] Jamie Dimon has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c33c9577-0faf-424d-919e-68bda2052867\">changed the narrative</a> from if and when the economy recovers to how many years will the expansion last,” said Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo.</p> <p>A years-long expansion could mean lower credit costs, sustained strength in capital markets activity and a steepening yield curve that boosts traditional banking revenue, he added.&#xa0;</p> <p>JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo kick off the earnings season on Wednesday. Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley report later in the week. Here are five things to watch for in the results.</p> <h2>Reserve releases</h2> <p>The Big Six banks had almost $96bn put aside for loan losses at the end of the fourth quarter, more than twice their reserves before the pandemic. The extra money was set aside for losses that, for the most part, have not materialised.</p> <p>As more and more Americans are vaccinated and the government pumps out more stimulus, banks' credit models will all but force them to release some of the cash. This will be significant: in the case of Citigroup, for example, the pandemic reserves are worth almost 10 per cent of the bank's market capitalisation.</p> <h2>Loan growth</h2> <p>After a year when loan balances have shrunk, several bank executives have said they expect loan growth to pick up in the second half of this year. Investors will want to hear those promises reiterated on the banks' calls with analysts this week.</p> <p>As for the first quarter, though, it is unlikely there will be many green shoots visible. Data from the Federal Reserve show that neither<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CIBOARD\"> commercial</a> nor<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CCLACBW027SBOG\"> credit-card</a> borrowing has picked up yet.</p> <p>“It's that second-half growth that people are going to be focused on,” said Jeff Harte, bank analyst at Piper Sandler. “I don't think management will back off their forecasts, but it becomes a bigger question with each passing month. I get nervous it turns into an early 2022 event.”&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h2>Deposit glut</h2> <p>During the last round of earnings calls, bank executives clamoured for regulatory relief as<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-banks-results-deposits/big-u-s-banks-hunger-for-loans-capital-relief-as-deposits-pile-up-idUSKBN29P18M\"> deposits flooded in</a> faster than they could find profitable ways to lend them. In the absence of loan growth, deposits are costly and require banks to hold more capital.</p> <p>So far their requests have gone unanswered, and analysts expect banks to report that deposits continued to pile up during the quarter as the federal government and the Fed pumped yet more cash into the US economy.</p> <p>“If trajectories of deposit growth, don't change . . . there will be some challenges for JPMorgan and Citi sometime in 2022” assuming current regulatory standards stay in place, said RBC analyst Gerard Cassidy. Without relief, those banks risk triggering new capital restrictions. He expects bank executives to make more noise about the issue this week.</p> <h2>Dealmaking frenzy</h2> <p>The first quarter last year was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f798e54-4570-11ea-aeb3-955839e06441\">sluggish </a>for mergers and acquisitions, as the pandemic unfolded. Not this year.&#xa0;Many investment banking units are expected to report record year-on-year growth.</p> <p>“It was one of the best first quarters since 1980, globally,” said Marc-Anthony Hourihan, global co-head of M&amp;A at UBS, of overall deal volume. </p> <p>Special purpose acquisition companies (Spacs) continued to play a prominent role, accounting for 70 per cent of overall M&amp;A volume, while the market for initial public offerings was busier than in any quarter since 2000, UBS analysts said.</p> <p>Investors will be keen to hear which banks were able to increase their market share — and which punched below their weight.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Trading fees</h2> <p>Most banks are predicting year-over-year growth in trading fees even after the massive double-digit percentage jumps they enjoyed last year when markets were swinging wildly in the early days of the pandemic.</p> <p>Capital markets activity has been a source of strength for banks throughout the crisis, helping them offset declines in revenue from core banking functions such as making loans.</p> <p>Bank analysts will be listening out for executive commentary on how long the windfall will last and whether their corporate clients are still looking to tap markets for funding.</p> <p>“The concern now is, have we already seen the best days of the cycle?” said Piper Sandler's Harte. “It all comes down to corporates' demand for capital.”</p><p>Source: Imani Moise and Robert Armstrong in New York 2021 'Five things to watch in US bank earnings' FT.com 13 April.
