  "text": "<p>London Stock Exchange Group shareholders have delivered a sharp rebuke over the bumper pay rise awarded to chief executive David Schwimmer, just weeks after the company angered investors by revealing a much higher-than-expected bill for integrating Refinitiv.</p> <p>Almost 24 per cent of votes were cast against the LSE's decision to raise Schwimmer's pay for 2020 by a quarter, prompting the exchange operator to acknowledge that “certain shareholders would have preferred the increase to have been phased in”.</p> <p>Following the vote at the LSE's annual shareholder meeting, held virtually, the company said it would consult with shareholders and publish an update within six months. The operator added that it had undertaken extensive engagement with investors before increasing the pay of Schwimmer, a former Goldman Sachs banker who has led the LSE since 2018.</p> <p>The pay rise took Schwimmer's total remuneration last year<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bbbf8294-a49e-4bd9-a4f1-d736f7080be3\"> to £6.9m</a>, up from £2.5m in 2019. Just over £4m was related to long-term share incentives that will vest. </p> <p>The company said the pay increase, which makes Schwimmer one of the best-paid chief executives in the FTSE 100, reflected the transformational effect of its $27bn purchase of data and trading group Refinitiv in 2019. Investors hailed the deal, sending LSE shares up sharply.</p> <p>However, the stock has struggled since the LSE warned it March that it would incur £1bn of expenses this year to integrate Refinitiv as well as prepare the sale of Borsa Italiana to rival Euronext. </p> <p>The unexpected announcement triggered the biggest&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3cd149f6-8136-42bf-9319-e861c11a89ef\">one-day fall</a>&#xa0;in LSE shares in 20 years. ISS, the shareholder advisory group, urged investors to vote against the package because of the costs of integrating Refinitiv.</p> <p>The scale of the vote against Schwimmer came even though 28 per cent of LSE shares are owned by groups led by Blackstone and Thomson Reuters, which sold a majority stake in Refinitiv to the UK group. A further 7.6 per cent of LSE shares are owned by the Qatar sovereign wealth fund.</p> <p>The LSE said on Wednesday that shareholders holding just over 85 per cent of the stock voted on the pay package.</p> <p>The company had earlier reported a 3.9 per cent rise in total income in the first quarter. Growth was largely driven by customers wanting pricing, reference information and benchmark data from FTSE Russell, the group's index business. LSE added that it had made about £40m of cost savings since the purchase of Refinitiv and was on track to hit its target of making a quarter of a promised £350m in savings by the end of the year. </p> <p>Shares in the LSE closed up 1.2 per cent to £75.72 in London.</p><p>Source: Philip Stafford 2021 'LSE rebuked by investors over chief's pay package' FT.com 28 April.
