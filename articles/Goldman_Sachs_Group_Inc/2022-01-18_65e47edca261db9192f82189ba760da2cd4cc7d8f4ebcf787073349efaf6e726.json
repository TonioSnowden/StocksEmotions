  "title": "Brace for a volatile 2022, but cling to this tech stalwart when the storm comes, says investment adviser",
  "text": "<p>The pace of Federal Reserve monetary policy tightening amid the highest inflation in about 40 years, a bumpy start to the corporate earnings reporting season and pandemic uncertainties are just a few things on the worry list. Technology stocks COMP are set to take the biggest hit on Tuesday, as a rapid rise in short term interest rates tends to make their future cash flows less valuable.</p><p>While a Deutsche Bank chart (below) reveals more tech-bubble worries, our call of the day makes a case for one of the biggest tech stalwarts, Apple AAPL, saying the iPhone maker has an ace in the hole that few are paying attention to.</p><p>That call comes from investment adviser Wedgewood Partners, who kick off their fourth-quarter 2021 client letter with a warning about market volatility for 2022, triggered by central bankers who are about to usher in some market chaos by pulling the plug on years of cheap money. Even Chinese President Xi Jinping was heard warning the Fed not to hike interest rates at a virtual Davos on Tuesday.</p><p>However, the adviser also sees opportunities ahead as selling picks up speed, and they plan to stick to Apple, which they've owned for 16 years.</p><p>While Wedgewood said it couldn't foresee the many products the company unveiled, “we did know that Apple's vertically integrated [software and hardware] product development strategy was unique and extremely capable of creating products and experiences that customers thought worthwhile enough to spend growing amounts of time and money on,” said the adviser.</p><p>Today, that strategy remains intact, but more important Apple is commanding a key new realm, having developed over a dozen custom processors and integrated circuits, since launching its “A-series” processors. For example, one it produced in 2017 provided the iPhone X with enough power to operate FaceID 3-D algorithms, used to unlock phones and make digital payments.</p><p>“Apple has effectively created a semiconductor business that rivals and even surpasses some of the most established semiconductor-focused businesses in the industry,” said Wedgewood. “Apple continues to differentiate through vertical integration, which has been a hallmark of Apple's long-term strategy to grow and capture superior profitability. It is difficult to predict what new products will be unveiled; however, we think this strategy should continue to serveshareholders quite well.”</p><p>Other top positions recommended by Wedgewood include telecom group Motorola MSI, another tech stalwart Microsoft MSFT and retailer Tractor Supply TSCO.</p><p>Here's a final comment from Wedgewood about the stock storm it sees brewing. “The graphic below reminds us that when speculation reigns, markets can go far higher than what seems sober,” but when they fall “markets will repeat their long history of falling faster and further than what seems sober.”</p><p>Wedgewood Partners“Long term investors should root for such downside. Such times are opportunities to improve portfolios. Our pencils are sharpened for opportunities as Mr. Market serves them up.”</p><p>The markets</p><p>Microsoft shares are slipping after the tech group confirmed it will buy Activision Blizzard ATVI in a $68.7 billion cash deal.
