  "title": "Fed Officials Lay Out Case for Further Rate Rises; Loretta Mester said inflation is the No. 1 challenge for the U.S. economy; James Bullard reiterated his view that the central bank needs to move 'aggressively' in raising rates",
  "text": "<p>\"Based on my current outlook and my assessment of the risks to the outlook, I believe it will be appropriate this year to move the target range of the fed-funds rate up to its longer-run level, which I estimate to be about 2.5%, and to follow with further rate increases next year,\" Ms. Mester said. </p><p>Ms. Mester is a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year. It met last week and raised its overnight target rate range from near zero levels to between 0.25% and 0.50%, and signaled that more increases are coming. Officials have penciled in a federal-funds rate of just under 2% for the end of 2022. </p><p>In her speech, Ms. Mester said rate rises are about lowering excessive levels of demand in an otherwise strong economy with a still solid outlook. But she noted that Russia's attack on Ukraine has complicated the outlook. It has added upside risks to inflation and downside risk to growth, but she noted, \"unless the conflict escalates, the direct effects on the U.S. economy are likely to remain manageable.\"</p><p>\"At this point, I view the upside risks to inflation stemming from the conflict as being more significant than the downside risks to growth in the U.S.,\" Ms. Mester said. </p><p>The Cleveland Fed official's comments followed a television interview earlier in the day from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard. He reiterated his belief that the U.S. central bank needs to move \"aggressively\" with rate rises to help bring inflationary pressures back under control.</p><p>\"We need to get to neutral at least so that we're not putting upward pressure on inflation during this period when we have much higher inflation than we're used to in the U.S. economy,\" Mr. Bullard said on Bloomberg's television channel.</p><p>Mr. Bullard was the sole dissenting voice at last week's FOMC meeting and voted in favor of a half percentage point increase.</p><p>Mr. Bullard's comments Tuesday followed remarks Monday from Fed chairman Jerome Powell, which were decidedly hawkish and suggested aggressive action from the central bank going forward. \"We will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability. In particular, if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal-funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so,\" Mr. Powell said.</p><p>Following Mr. Powell, economists at Goldman Sachs shifted their monetary policy forecast in a very hawkish direction. They now see half percentage point increases at both the Fed's May and June meetings, followed by four 25 basis point rate increases at the remaining meetings of the year. More hikes are likely for next year, the Goldman Sachs economists said, but they also added, \"we have left our forecast of the terminal rate unchanged at 3-3.25%.\"</p><p>Mr. Bullard said that he sees aggressive moves ahead for the Fed as it moves toward a 2% federal-funds rate, which he considers to be neutral. In terms of the pace of getting there, \"50 basis point moves would definitely be in the mix,\" Mr. Bullard said.</p><p>Mr. Bullard also said in the interview that the U.S. can't wait for a resolution of geopolitical issues to get monetary policy to a more appropriate setting where it is no longer pushing up already high inflation pressures.</p><p>Write to Michael S.
