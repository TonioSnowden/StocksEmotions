  "text": "<p>Wall Street is in the grip of Spac-mania. Three weeks into the new year and 57 so-called “blank cheque” companies have floated on US exchanges, raising $15.7bn, according to Refinitiv. Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon this week questioned the incentives that inspire sponsors. He had a point.</p> <p>The new year surge has dwarfed the total of $234.1m raised during the same period last year. The prospects of quick riches have prompted everyone from activist investor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b4a74a4-5c60-4181-abb9-b1f2baaca576\">Bill Ackman</a> to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b21dfee-ac02-45d3-b063-0a0fc0cb523c\">rapper Jay-Z</a> to jump on the bandwagon. </p> <p>Spacs — short for “special purpose acquisition companies” — sell shares publicly and use the money raised to buy something — usually within two years. The vehicles are touted as a way to invest in a hot company that they may otherwise miss out on. Proponents say they also offer private businesses a fast, cheap way to go public.</p> <p>Snags abound. Spac founders are incentivised to buy something — anything — with the cash raised before their deadline (subject to investor approval). Founders are covered if investments sour. They typically receive a stake of 20 per cent for finding good targets. In theory, this looks a small price to pay should the purchase end up as the next DraftKings, a recent Spac success.&#xa0;</p> <p>In practice, Spacs acquire companies of varying quality, taking them public with skimpier disclosure than a traditional initial public offering requires. A <a href=\"https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=528094093074028100092005073094067027051081060000028091094064073023097067009065067087049101030035000120107087010003113077070071020058046015033069092014031091118065006000035124125002099072073003007098122022072006121100101103099004111080102072073066083&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE\">recent study</a> found that most Spac share prices fell post-merger. </p> <p>Costs can be high. While Spacs usually sell at $10 per share when they float, by the time the median Spac merges with a target, it holds just $6.67 in cash for each outstanding share. </p> <p>If the chief executive of Goldman Sachs — a big Spac underwriter — has concerns about the incentive structures, regulators should have too. Spac founders should not get a big windfall of shares simply for doing a deal. Such awards should trickle out over the years that follow as progress milestones are met.</p> <p><em>Lex recommends the FT's Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.
