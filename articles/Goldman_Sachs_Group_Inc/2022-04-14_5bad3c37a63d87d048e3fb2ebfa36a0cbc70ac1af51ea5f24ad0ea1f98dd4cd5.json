About 85% of those clients are based outside of Russia, it said.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. said Wednesdayit was budgeting for higher lossesbecause of the war in Ukraine. JPMorgan also took some losses related to commodities such as nickel, which have been volatile since the invasion.</p><p>Citigroup Chief Executive Jane Fraser is pushing a new strategy that includes selling international consumer businesses while expanding wealth management and business banking.
