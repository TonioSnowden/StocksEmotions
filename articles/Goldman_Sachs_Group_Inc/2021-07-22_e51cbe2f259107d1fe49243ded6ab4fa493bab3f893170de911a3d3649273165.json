  "text": "<p>DraftKings Chief Executive Jason Robins said at a Goldman Sachs conference in June that the company is \"excited and hopeful that we'll be able to put a very competitive bid forth and be selected as one of the handful of operators in New York.\"</p><p>FanDuel said the company is excited for the opportunity to offer its services in New York and was reading the request for applications closely.</p><p>The state estimates mobile betting will eventually generate $482 million in annual tax revenue from a roughly $1 billion sports-wagering market. But New York isn't making it easy for gambling companies, according to people familiar with the state's plans. Companies must offer to pay the state at least 50% of their revenues, which some say could reach 60% to 65% in the competitive process.</p><p>New York State Budget Director Robert Mujica, a fiscal adviser to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, said the state expects major industry players will apply. \"New York is a massive market,\" Mr. Mujica said. \"One way or another, providers will participate, so we think they'll put their best foot forward.\"</p><p>After several years of deliberations, Mr. Cuomo and New York state legislators agreed to legalize online sports betting as part of the state budget adopted in April. Legislators pushed for a model, similar to New Jersey, where casinos would join with mobile betting companies. A tax rate would have been fixed in law.</p><p>Instead, the state will choose at least two platform providers, which would supply the technology, and four operators, which would offer the consumer-facing brands. New York's gaming commission will score licensees based on an applicant's record and plans, but also on how high a tax rate they are willing to pay.</p>",
