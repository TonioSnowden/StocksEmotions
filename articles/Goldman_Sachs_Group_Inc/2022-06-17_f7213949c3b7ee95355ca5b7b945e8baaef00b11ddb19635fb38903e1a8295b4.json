  "title": "MANSION --- Private Properties: Former CIO of Goldman Sachs Lists Penthouse in Manhattan",
  "text": "<p>Ms. Sillcox, or Leslie Tortora as she was known during her time at Goldman Sachs, and her husband, Mark Sillcox, purchased the condo from the developer for about $13.14 million in 2007, according to property records. The Sillcoxes didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The building was designed by Ateliers Jean Nouvel, and the penthouse received a custom build-out from architect Lee F. Mindel, said Mr. Gomes. The kitchen, dining room and a seating area are encased in a 20-foot-high glass box. The apartment has a 145-square-foot balcony and free-floating metal staircase. A living room converts into an outdoor loggia at the press of a button thanks to a retractable wall, Mr. Gomes said. Windows throughout the unit are accented with red and blue stained glass. The windows are also treated for ultraviolet protection, with automatic shades and specialized cooling and heating systems to minimize unwanted temperature fluctuations, said Mr. Gomes.</p><p>Mr. Gomes said the couple are selling because they are spending more time at their house in upstate New York.</p><p>Ms. Sillcox joined Goldman Sachs in 1984 and was one of the first women on its management committee. She retired from Goldman in 2001, and she and her husband are trustees of the Tortora Sillcox Family Foundation, Douglas Elliman said.</p><p>In May, there were four Manhattan condo sales of at least $20 million, up from one in May of last year, according to a Douglas Elliman report.</p>",
