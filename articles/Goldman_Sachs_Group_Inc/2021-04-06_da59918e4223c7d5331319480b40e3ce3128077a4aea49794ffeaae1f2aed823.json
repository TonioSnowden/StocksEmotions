  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> two senior <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> executives are leaving the bank as it deals with the fallout from twin crises involving <strong>Archegos Capital</strong> and <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>. <strong>Lara Warner</strong>, the group's chief risk and compliance officer, and <strong>Brian Chin</strong>, head of the investment bank, are set to depart, according to people with knowledge of the moves. The bank could make the announcements as early as Tuesday morning.

After being <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2012-2012-264htm\">fined millions of dollars in the US</a> to settle illegal trading charges in 2012 and <a href=\"https://hsfnotes.com/asiadisputes/2014/10/23/hong-kong-market-misconduct-tribunal-bans-tiger-asia-management-llc-and-bill-hwang-sung-kook-from-trading-securities-in-hong-kong-for-a-period-of-4-years/\">banned</a> from trading in Hong Kong the following year, Hwang <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7e0f57b-3751-42b8-8a17-eb7749f4dbc8?shareType=nongift\">found redemption</a> from the very same banks that shunned him years ago, growing his new family office Archegos Capital from $200m in assets at its 2012 launch to almost $10bn in just nine years.</p> <p>But now Hwang once again finds himself in hot water, knee-deep in a Wall Street conundrum of biblical proportions. DD breaks down the ensuing chaos <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79d29496-8785-4d55-af2a-8619cf99a613\">here</a>, if you're not caught up.&#xa0;</p> <p>(Bottom line: a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2542af81-9e93-4d05-a0b9-26c0f6aab6f3\">fire sale</a> of billions in stocks tied to Archegos derivatives trades by <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> last week. Lenders that didn't move fast enough, including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/928b263d-38fc-4484-beb9-3e2fc4c017cb\">Credit Suisse</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dbf5b57f-fcbb-47ad-b16b-5777232639f8\"><strong>Nomura</strong></a>, face staggering losses.)</p> <p>And big banks aren't the only ones undergoing a crisis of confidence.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Hedge funds are now taking a closer look at their prime brokers — that is, the banks they use for stock lending, leverage and trade execution services — as the Archegos fallout breeds reputational concerns and worries that banks' poor risk management could translate to their balance sheets as it did in 2008.</p> <p>“Prime brokerage looks a lot riskier today than two weeks ago,” <strong>Andrew Beer</strong>, managing member at the fund group <strong>Dynamic Beta Investments</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b6e0dab-730d-4e0c-bab7-3be4f70e7a6f\">told</a> the FT's Laurence Fletcher. “Every bank risk manager will be in the hot seat to prove that outstanding lines and swaps to hedge funds and family offices are prudent and sufficiently collateralised.”</p> <p>The head of one London-based hedge fund said the firm had “initiated an internal process” to evaluate its prime broking relationships, while another fund said it had received questions from investors about which banks it was exposed to.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I'd not be very comfortable if we had balances” at one of the banks caught up in the scandal, said the head of a large Europe-based hedge fund firm.</p> <p>One FT reader raises a fair question about where hedge funds' heads are at:</p> <p>In any case, this isn't the first time Hwang, described by one analyst as an “aggressive, moneymaking genius”, must attempt to dig himself out of a very large hole.</p> <p>In the Bible, Jesus was described as the Archegos, the “author” of forgiveness and salvation. But banks, and hedge funds for that matter, are likely re-evaluating their own capacities for offering second chances.</p> <h2>The fall of Neil Woodford, ‘Britain's Warren Buffett'&#xa0;</h2> <p>Almost two years have passed since one of Britain's biggest<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dcc04950-f680-4210-af4e-669413501951\"> investment scandals</a>, yet financial advisers, lawyers and regulators are still squabbling about what caused <strong>Neil Woodford</strong>'s implosion.</p> <p>DD readers will hardly need reminding of the events of the summer of 2019, when the stock picker once regarded as “Britain's Warren Buffett” and “the man who made Middle England rich” was forced to suspend his flagship £3.7bn Equity Income fund after coming stuck in a self-imposed liquidity trap.</p> <p>At least three lawsuits are in the works, representing many of the more than 300,000 savers who entrusted Woodford with their nest eggs but stand to lose up to £1bn. The UK's financial regulator has yet to publish its much anticipated report into the crisis, and has attracted scorn from politicians for its tardiness.</p> <p>A<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e817d435-d82d-4dd2-b248-dcf6dc7973fe\"> new book</a> on the subject suggests one of the chief reasons for the high-profile fund manager's downfall is a topic close to DD readers' hearts: due diligence — or, at least, a lack thereof.</p> <p><em>Built on a Lie</em> by Owen Walker — a member of the FT's award-winning reporting team that led coverage of the crisis two years ago — delves into the culture of Woodford's boutique investment firm, <strong>Woodford Investment Management</strong>, to discover what went wrong.</p> <p>In one passage, Walker hears from an early employee of the business about how Woodford struggled to deal with the intense interest from brokers pitching start-ups in need of funding.</p> <p>“There was practically a queue of people around the block,” he recalled.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Neil was very good on public company selections, when you're looking at documents that all have rules and regulations around them. But he applied the same thinking to private companies, where they would say, ‘Next year, we're going to get this drug authorised and we'll make billions,' and he'd say, ‘I'm in for that.'&#xa0;</p> <p>“So, there was no due diligence done. Neil literally wanted to invest in everything that came in.”</p> <p>Order your copy via <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/books/built-on-a-lie-the-rise-and-fall-of-neil-woodford-and-the-fate-of-middle-england-s-money/9780241468197\">Bookshop.org</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Built-Lie-Woodford-Middle-Englands/dp/0241468191\">Amazon</a>.</p> <h2>Greenoaks: Silicon Valley's best-kept secret</h2> <p><strong>SoftBank</strong> might have drawn the most headlines when it emerged with a massive stake in <strong>Coupang</strong>, but the company's listing also minted a fortune for a far more low-key investor.</p> <p><strong>Greenoaks</strong>, a San Francisco-based firm with a <a href=\"http://www.greenoakscap.com/\">spartan website</a>, came out with an 11-figure investment in the South Korean ecommerce group, which last month completed the largest listing for an international company in the US since<strong> Alibaba</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>About half of Greenoaks' winnings came from a $430m convertible debt deal struck just months before SoftBank poured $2bn into the company in 2018.&#xa0;</p> <p>That deal, through what is known as a payment-in-kind clause, allowed Greenoaks to accrue a growing stake in the business in lieu of interest payments.</p> <p>The move has paid off handsomely, resulting in the first of what could be multiple billion-dollar payouts this year for the young group led by <strong>Neil Mehta</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fee5ec23-daa8-4342-8d0e-06bb2303df05\">reports</a> DD's Miles Kruppa.</p> <p>Though few outside of Silicon Valley have heard of Greenoaks, it has quietly built a reputation for top performance. Through to the end of last year, its funds had returned 51 per cent annually since 2012, more than tripling the benchmark.</p> <p>The question now for Greenoaks, which is known for taking highly concentrated positions in its top companies, is the same for many other young venture companies used to the post-crisis tech bull market: can you survive a downturn?</p> <p>“A lot of investors we work with, they're either too optimistic or too pessimistic,” one of Greenoaks' earliest investors told Miles. “Neil is very good at threading that needle.”</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Activist investor <strong>Carl Icahn</strong> has hired former <strong>General Electric </strong>chief investment officer<strong> Aris Kekedjian </strong>to be chief executive of <strong>Icahn Enterprises</strong>. The move comes as the group's current chief <strong>Keith Cozza</strong> and chief financial officer <strong>SungHwan Cho</strong> prepare to leave. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/rival-group-makes-fully-financed-roughly-680m-bid-for-tribune-sources-say-11617571936?mod=hp_lista_pos2\">More here</a> from the WSJ.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Linklaters </strong>has appointed <strong>Thomas McGrath</strong> as its US global practice head, effective immediately for a four-year term.
