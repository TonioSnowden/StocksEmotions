  "text": "<p><br>Hi from London, where I've just shifted to full-time column writing after nearly eight years as a senior editor. I spent the week weighing claims from 22-year-old Goldman Sachs analysts who make six figures that we should feel sorry for them because they have been working so hard. Though many Wall Street veterans will disagree, I ended up feeling sympathetic, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19a14cad-b5fc-4fc3-aa5a-ca306af5b831\">at least in part</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the ongoing to and fro about the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine's safety and effectiveness feels far too personal. I don't regret getting the shot but I wish they'd clean up the data. I hope you enjoy my pick of the week's stories, plus a few from elsewhere you shouldn't miss.&#xa0;<a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/pages/newsletters/5a8d70c20bfc0e000429c348/subscribe/success\">Click here</a> if you'd like to receive Long Story Short by email every Friday.</p> <h2>1. ‘In love with bad ideas'</h2> <p>Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador won a landslide victory in 2018 by promising revolutionary action to tackle corruption, violence and an economy that never grew. As someone who has loved visiting the Yucatán Peninsula, my eye was caught by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2537ad5-d72e-4b72-885b-01ceb543c253\">this vivid analysis</a> of how his obsession with huge state-funded projects is playing out there. The $7.8bn Maya Train project would destroy homes to build a largely diesel railway when other countries are focusing on sustainability. Critics say the president's approach is bound to fail. According to one Citigroup analyst: </p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“He has firmly oriented the Mexican economic ship towards the 20th century.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>2. The asset manager some call ‘WhiteRock'</h2> <p>For the past couple of years, BlackRock's chief executive Larry Fink has positioned his financial group to be the arbiter of good corporate behaviour on everything from gender equity to climate change. So allegations from current and former employees of colour that they were mistreated cut particularly deep. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6476e681-4154-43a6-93e4-f5c86ae30dd9\">When Aziza Kasumov investigated</a>, one current employee told her: </p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“Every time I see another person of colour joining or interning I'm like, please escape, find a better opportunity.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>3.&#xa0;‘Sometimes sleeping on the job should be paid too'</h2> <p>In my old job as opinion editor, I learned that Sarah O'Connor invariably has something fresh to say about employment issues. This week, she asked whether people should be paid when they are required to be “available” but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c932b78a-f9e0-452f-8f64-b7b29e02a05d\">are not actually working</a>. Is a care worker who stays overnight at a client's house “at work” when they are sleeping? How about an Uber driver who is waiting to be to assigned a passenger? She points out:</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“As more people work from home thanks to the pandemic, the lines between being ‘at work' and ‘available' could become blurrier still.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h2>4. ‘I was pushed to my max. Absolute exhaustion'</h2> <p>Being a doctor can be stressful at the best of times. Treating Covid-19 victims while living in lockdown has triggered an epidemic of post-traumatic stress disorder among medics, India Ross discovered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7afccf9e-b3d3-4a27-8215-c7cd3fcfac41\">in this powerful magazine piece</a>. One sufferer, an anaesthesiologist at a teaching hospital in Brooklyn, described the relentless work:</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“I realised that I'm intubating the neighbour of the patient that I had intubated earlier. And that one was already dead.”</em> </p> </blockquote> <h2>5.&#xa0;Top tables: a post-lockdown London wishlist</h2> <p>With outdoor restaurant dining scheduled to reopen in the UK from April 12, FT readers are already salivating. Their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7a2f285-6799-479a-aa5a-81a46cc9f62a\">paeans to the restaurants they miss</a> — and the fabulous photos — had me jonesing along with them. This is how one reader pictures his return to the River Café in Hammersmith (above), which is where my family likes to celebrate special occasions:</p> <blockquote>  <p><em>“What will we eat? Asparagus, turbot, panna cotta — with whatever wine they suggest. And, almost certainly, champagne.”</em>&#xa0;</p> </blockquote> <h2>Quick hits</h2> <h4>OTHER FT STORIES THAT HAVE CAUGHT MY EYE THIS WEEK</h4> <ul>  <li><p>While Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and other social media titans were being grilled by Congress this week about misinformation on their platforms, the FT revealed that big companies have gone back to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/521423bf-4012-4e42-9877-53d5d0f44675\">giving money to Republicans</a>.

The pictures accompanying this frightening feature are stunning.</p></li>  <li><p>WeWork, the co-working space provider that saw its planned IPO collapse in 2019, is aiming for the stock market again. But it's still swimming in red ink and posted a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46561422-9edd-4b3b-959c-85754a381d9d\">$3.2bn loss last year</a>.</p></li>  <li><p>In a stark reminder of how interconnected we are, a strong gust of wind in the Suez Canal has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/171c92ec-0a44-4dc5-acab-81ee2620d3c1\">snarled up global trade</a>. One of the world's largest container ships ran aground and blocked the narrow passage.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Best of the rest</h2> <h4>WHAT I'VE BEEN READING ELSEWHERE</h4> <ol>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/20/books/booktok-tiktok-video.html?name=styln-books-general&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;block=storyline_menu_recirc&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;impression_id=&amp;variant=1_Show\"><strong>How crying on TikTok sells books</strong></a> The short video app has hundreds of millions of young users.

These Americans refuse to play along. (The Atlantic)</p></li> </ol> <h2>Before you go</h2> <p>I'm a native New Yorker and I miss the city's vibrancy. So I am crossing my fingers that I can get to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's new tribute to Alice Neel. She was a 20th-century portraitist who lived and painted in Spanish Harlem. Her sometimes angry, sometimes sympathetic subjects simply leap off the canvas. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCB0_d7H3rE\">This video</a> linked to the exhibition features both her art and her words. It also takes me home. </p> <p>We always want to hear your thoughts and feedback, so drop me a line at <a href=\"mailto:brooke.masters@ft.com\">brooke.masters@ft.com</a> or email us at&#xa0;<a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=longstoryshort@ft.com\">longstoryshort@ft.com</a>&#xa0;— and remember to take some time away from your screens this weekend.</p> <p><strong>Brooke</strong><br><em>Chief business commentator</em></p><p>Source: Brooke Masters 2021 'A selection of the FT's biggest stories and best reads every Friday' FT.com 26 March.
