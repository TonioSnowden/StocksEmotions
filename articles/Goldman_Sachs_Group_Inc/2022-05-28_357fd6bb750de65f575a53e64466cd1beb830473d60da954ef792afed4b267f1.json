  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Japan's Banks Prepare To Share the Wealth --- The country's lenders are sitting on large stock holdings. That could start to change soon.",
  "text": "<p>Japanese regional banks don't look like good investments: Returns have been paltry and growth is nonexistent. Their small scale makes it hard to compete with the country's megabanks, and Japan's low interest rates and aging population just add to their problems. Shares of Japanese regional banks have nearly halved since 2015, according to FactSet.</p><p>Surprisingly, that all might be about to change. What could attract investors is that these stodgy institutions may finally have to deal with their large holdings of other Japanese companies, resulting in higher payouts -- during a period when cash is king in global markets. Such cross-shareholdings have been common in Japan's corporate world as they own stakes in each other to maintain business ties.</p><p>\"A lot of the cross-holding is a 'circle the wagons' construct providing a stable group of votes,\" said Travis Lundy, an independent analyst who publishes on investment-research platform Smartkarma.</p><p>But most Japanese regional banks just sit on these cross-holdings, leading to bulky balance sheets with low returns on equity. That is one reason they trade way below their book values.</p><p>Japan's push to improve corporate governance in recent years, however, has driven companies to unwind at least some of their cross-shareholdings -- and now regional banks are starting to heed the call. Bank of Kyoto said this week it would cut the book value of its strategic holdings by 10%, the first time it has announced such a plan. Book values of these holdings are much lower than their actual market values, because many of these were bought a long time ago at much lower costs.</p><p>Bank of Kyoto owns the most strategic shareholdings among all the regional banks: Its holdings are worth almost three times the bank's market value, according to Goldman Sachs. The bank owns large stakes in many companies based in Kyoto -- most famously Nintendo. Its 4% stake in the game company alone is equal in value to around two-thirds of the bank's market capitalization.</p><p>Rising shareholder activism in Japan may have given the bank a nudge. U.K. investment fund Silchester has been pushing Bank of Kyoto and a few other regional banks to raise payouts, including through a special dividend. While the Bank of Kyoto's board has rejected this proposal, the fund has no doubt exerted pressure.</p><p>A rapid unwinding of these cross-shareholdings is unrealistic to expect. But a gradual move in the right direction may eventually bear fruit for investors.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
