  "text": "<p>\"Despite some uncertainty around the near-term operating environment (MAU [monthly-active-user] growth, macroeconomic impact on industry spend, competition, etc.), we see Pinterest as positively levered to a number of long-term secular growth themes (engagement &amp; ad spend shifting online, social commerce, creator economy, etc.) and see a more positive risk/reward skew at current levels,\" Sheridan wrote.</p><p>He sees a number of ways that Pinterest can increase its average revenue per user, including through better international monetization, efforts around new \"ad surfaces\" such as Catalog Pins, and inflation in the CPM, or the cost for every 1,000 advertising impressions, as the company improves targeting and measuring capabilities.</p><p>Opinion: Pinterest never considered itself a social network. Until now.</p><p>Sheridan notes that Pinterest's management team seems focused on better enabling commerce through the site by \"leveraging the unique elements of the platform with respect to high shopping intent and utilities of both discovery &amp; conversion.\" The company is looking to boost the portion of \"shoppable inventory\" on the Pinterest platform, he wrote, after speaking with executives at a recent Goldman conference.</p><p>\"Our recent industry channel check and third-party data work has given us increased confidence in Pinterest's ability to grow monetization and capture a greater share of ad budgets as management executes against its shopping/commerce opportunity,\" he wrote.</p><p>Opinion: Pinterest's new CEO faces rough road in getting users to buy instead of just pinning</p><p>Sheridan added that Pinterest \"is currently in the later stages of a two-year investment cycle\" but that he sees opportunities for margin expansion over the next three to five years as Pinterest increases average revenue per user and realizes a \"meaningful deceleration\" in adjusted expense growth.</p><p>Shares of Pinterest are up 5% in Thursday morning trading. They've gained 32% over the past three months, though they're off 49% over a 12-month basis. The S&amp;P 500 SPX has slipped 2% over three months and is down 13% over 12 months.</p><p>Why Pinterest shares are worth a buy despite 'uncertain times' for digital ads</p>",
