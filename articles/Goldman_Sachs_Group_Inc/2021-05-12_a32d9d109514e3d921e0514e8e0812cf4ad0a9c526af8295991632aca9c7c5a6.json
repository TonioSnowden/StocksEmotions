  "text": "<p><strong>Flutter</strong>'s plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb0cf9a4-3079-4a41-a18e-b2a2e67e9b36\">partially float</a> its US business FanDuel look to have stalled following the resignation of its chief executive. </p> <p>Matt King, the driving force behind FanDuel, has handed in his notice after serving four years as CEO, the bookmaker said in a statement. A search for a successor is under way. </p> <p>Flutter, the gambling company behind PaddyPower and PokerStars, said it continues to assess the potential merits of listing a small stake in FanDuel in the US, adding: “Whilst Matt's departure will affect the timing of any potential US listing, the board will continue to keep this option under review.”</p> <p>Jefferies analyst James Wheatcroft said: “The new CEO search is expected to delay the US listing of FanDuel — we viewed the FanDuel listing as a way of narrowing the material valuation gap between Flutter and its US-listed peers.” </p> <p>Flutter had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb0cf9a4-3079-4a41-a18e-b2a2e67e9b36\">said in March</a> is was looking at a US IPO for FanDuel.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p>Healthcare services provider&#xa0;<strong>UDG Healthcare</strong>&#xa0;said it is recommending a £2.6bn cash offer put forward by private equity group Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice. Under the terms of the acquisition, shareholders will receive £10.23 per share, which is a premium of 21.5 per cent on Tuesday's closing price. UDG's board of directors voted unanimously in favour and recommend shareholders to approve the deal.</p> <p><strong>Diageo</strong> is restarting a capital return programme that was paused early in the coronavirus crisis. The Smirnoff and Guinness maker said organic operating profit growth will be at least 14 per cent in fiscal 2021, slightly ahead of organic net sales growth. In light of the strong performance and a return to organic net sales growth, Diageo restated its pledge in July 2019 to return £4.5bn to shareholders via buybacks on a timeline extended by two years to June 2024.</p> <p><strong>Coca-Cola HBC</strong> said first-quarter growth accelerated in emerging markets, while established and developing markets remained impacted by Covid-19 restrictions. The Coke bottler posted 6.1 per cent like-for-like revenue growth for the quarter on improved pricing in established markets and double-digit volume growth in Nigeria and Russia.</p> <p><strong>Spirax-Sarco</strong> said organic sales growth in the first four months of 2021 was ahead of the overall market thanks in part to “exceptional” demand from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector. The pump and thermal management specialist raised full-year profitability guidance and said it was stepping up investment to meet demand and the faster than expected global recovery. </p> <p>Interim results from <strong>Compass</strong> for the six months to March showed operating profit down 78 per cent to £168m and revenue 32 per cent lower at £8.4bn. The catering group said to expect a gradual improvement in trading over its fiscal third quarter. On profitability, Compass guided for a third-quarter underlying margin of between 4.5 per cent and&#xa0;5 per cent absorbing the cost of reopenings and mobilisations but reiterated a long-term target of rebuilding the margin to above 7 per cent as sales volumes return to pre-Covid levels.</p> <p><strong>Tui</strong> said summer 2021 bookings are down 69 per cent versus the summer 2019. Some 2.6m holidaymakers are booked to travel, a small reduction from three months ago as “the lack of clarity provided by governments on lifting of travel restrictions” meant customers chose to defer their booking to future seasons, it said. Tui said it remained committed to operating three-quarters of its regular capacity this summer. The holiday company posted a €1.5bn loss for its half year to March, with revenue down 89 per cent to €716.3m. </p> <p><strong>Vesuvius</strong> guided for a 2021 trading profit “moderately ahead” of the current consensus forecast. The crucible maker cited good commercial performance in the first quarter and clear evidence of end markets continuing to improve.</p> <p><strong>TP ICAP</strong> reported revenue down 12 per cent to £483m for the first quarter and left full-year targets unchanged. The interdealer broker said trading had returned to normal levels in April, in line with previous guidance, but flagged that sterling strength against the dollar was a headwind for revenue and earnings.</p> <p>Magazine publisher <strong>Future</strong> said it has bought Marie Claire US from Hearst Magazines Media on undisclosed terms. </p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <p>Housebuilder <strong>Redrow</strong> named as its new chair Richard Akers, formerly of Land Securities. Akers&#xa0;will succeed John Tutte in September.</p> <p>Alastair Cochran, <strong>Petrofac</strong>&#xa0;chief financial officer since 2016, has resigned to take up a new role outside the group from September. Afonso Reis e Sousa, currently the engineer's treasurer and head of tax, will succeed Cochran on the same date.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile</h2> <p>Companies are preparing to launch <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7adb226-e9a6-4cd8-9049-35d55c211ca4\">a record wave of share buybacks</a> as executives get comfortable with spending excess cash following a blockbuster earnings season and greater clarity on the trajectory of the world economy. <strong>US companies</strong> announced $484bn in&#xa0;share buybacks&#xa0;in the first four months of this year, the highest such total in at least two decades, according to Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>Billionaires <strong>Peter Thiel</strong>, <strong>Louis Bacon</strong> and <strong>Alan Howard</strong> are among the backers of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c982082b-c890-4880-b438-f8b3cae83a4b\">a new cryptocurrency asset exchange</a> called Bullish Global, which has been capitalised with more than $10bn in cash and digital assets ahead of its launch later this year. The venture will be run by blockchain software company Block.one and will bet heavily on the decentralised finance, or DeFi, market that has grown from about $15bn to $65bn since the start of the year, according to analysts at JPMorgan.</p> <p>Significant fuel shortages emerged on the US eastern seaboard <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39127d5e-310c-4462-8824-6f0b60e5e7a0\">on Tuesday night</a> as a rush by motorists drained filling stations. The panic-buying in areas of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Georgia came as the shutdown of <strong>the Colonial pipeline</strong>, a huge artery supplying the eastern US with fuel refined on the Gulf Coast, stretched into its fifth day.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>THG's latest delivery to the market prompted its shares to jump on Tuesday. But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ad84653-e32d-4249-bfb4-b33c88ce4569\">an unanswered question</a> is why a company that raised nearly £900m last September wants more cash and what it plans to do with it.</p> <p><strong>Brooke Masters</strong> <br>Peloton's hot streak&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/946aa89b-85e7-409d-bbae-16aeb61f211e\">may be fizzling out</a> after last year's fivefold stock price jump. Bike sales are “tapering”, the shares have dropped 40 per cent since January and the company just ran its first promotion since 2019.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Flutter delays plans for float of US sports betting business' FT.com 12 May.
