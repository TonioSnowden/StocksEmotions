  "text": "<h2>Dealmaking runs in the family</h2> <p>At DD we've been following <strong>Andrea Orcel</strong>'s winding tour of Europe's top investment banks. </p> <p>The Italian banker cycled from the helm of <strong>UBS</strong>'s investment bank to what was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a022da22-1923-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21\">almost the highest-paid CEO job</a> in the eurozone at Spain's<strong> Santander</strong> before rerouting to the helm of Italy's <strong>UniCredit</strong>.</p> <p>In all the action, it's easy to see how the hard-charging dealmaker could overshadow his investment banker brother, <strong>Riccardo Orcel</strong>, in the headlines.</p> <p>While Andrea has been hopping through various financial hubs, Riccardo has (to the best of DD's knowledge) stayed put in Moscow helping <strong>VTB Capital</strong>, the investment banking arm of Russia's <strong>VTB Bank</strong>, become a dominant player in the Russian market.</p> <p>The bank rose from being known as a “rubbish bin for everything that didn't work in corporate Russia”, according to one person with close links to the bank, to become the country's second-largest lender.</p> <p>It was instrumental in financing Russia's war machine leading up to its invasion of Crimea in 2014 — so much so that the Kremlin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90c73fe4-fd15-11e7-9b32-d7d59aace167\">transferred defence lending</a> to a smaller bank in an attempt to protect VTB from sanctions in 2018.</p> <p>“There was always a great deal of mystery about what went on in that department, but everyone knew it was funding Russia's military-industrial complex,” a former senior VTB executive whose lift pass denied him access to the floor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8ceaee9-aac4-42b7-b698-c3bf2a616f36?shareType=nongift\">told the FT's Owen Walker</a>.</p> <p>Riccardo played a key role in VTB Capital's transformation since he joined in 2011, helping the Russian investment bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dbb09588-8579-11e1-90cd-00144feab49a\">poach a handful of bankers</a> from his old stomping grounds at<strong> Bank of America Merrill Lynch</strong>, where he and his brother rose through the ranks together.</p> <p>But in recent months, Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine has made VTB a central target in the west's economic affront against Russia.</p> <p>The Russian lender was sanctioned by the US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1600cbab-3c9d-4059-872a-c5cf512169a1\">in late February</a>, and is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27adf446-517a-4c4b-89e8-dee8757252e9\">preparing to wind down</a> its European operations after being hit with western sanctions, sources told the FT, after being removed from the Swift global payments system.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8797954.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Riccardo appears to have remained at VTB Capital until some point in the past several months. When exactly he left, and under what circumstances, is unclear. On Tuesday, the bank told the FT: “Riccardo Orcel terminated employment agreements with VTB Group.”</p> <p>On Tuesday he resurfaced as chair of Anglo-Russian gold producer <strong>Polymetal International</strong>.</p> <p>As of March 2, he still controlled <strong>Emerging Markets Horizon</strong>, a special purpose acquisition company he launched with VTB Capital finance director <strong>Bernard Abdelmalak</strong> that has <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-from-emerging-markets-horizon-corp-on-recent-sanctions-against-vtb-301494512.html\">also been hit by US sanctions</a>. The blank-cheque vehicle raised $250mn in December with plans to target high-growth companies in Russia and central and eastern Europe.</p> <p>Riccardo Orcel's arrival at Polymetal follows the abrupt departures of his British predecessor <strong>Ian Cockerill</strong> and five other board members, as Norway's sovereign wealth fund, one of Polymetal's top 10 shareholders, plans to dump all of its Russian investments. Shares in the mining group have plunged 88 per cent in the past month.</p> <p>The Orcel brothers now find themselves in opposite predicaments. Riccardo is enlisted to help reverse a Russian company's misfortunes due to sanctions, while Andrea stares down a potential <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fae7d5b7-112b-4b41-931c-e53643ab4d36\">€7bn loss</a> as UniCredit considers joining the parade of western institutions leaving the country.</p> <h2>Buffett spurns ‘money-shuffling' investment bankers&#xa0;</h2> <p>Investment bankers, accountants, consultants, lawyers and “such capital-reallocators as leveraged buyout operators” . . . if you're on this list, chances are <strong>Warren Buffett</strong> probably doesn't like you.</p> <p>He wrote as much in his 2015 <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2014ltr.pdf\">annual letter</a>, reducing the bunch to “a lot of mouths with expensive taste” that “clamour to be fed”.</p> <p>“Money-shufflers don't come cheap” after all, to quote the famed stockpicker. And based on his latest<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f816080e-9e46-4e6b-b838-46845b64aa6c\"> deal</a> to purchase insurance-to-toy manufacturing conglomerate <strong>Alleghany Corporation </strong>for $12bn, he hasn't softened his stance.</p> <p>A<a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000775368/4a2b34f2-a11a-48f9-b65f-0c31c6722f85.pdf\"> regulatory filing</a> published by Alleghany clarifies that Buffett's <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong> specifically factored investment banking fees charged by the target company's longtime adviser <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>into its $848 per share offer.</p> <p>Berkshire subtracted nearly $2 per share, or roughly $27mn, from its $850 per share offer “less the financial advisory fee due to the Financial Advisor in connection with the Merger”, it states.</p> <p>In other words, footing Goldman's bill will fall entirely on Alleghany shareholders.</p> <p>The Goldman bankers working on the deal include <strong>Pat Fels</strong>, head of the financial institutions group for the Americas, and <strong>Avi Mehrotra</strong>, global head of activism and shareholder defence. Buffett once had kind, if lukewarm praise for his former Goldman banker, <strong>Byron Trott</strong>. </p> <p>“He understands Berkshire far better than any investment banker with whom we have talked and — it hurts me to say this — earns his fee,” said Buffett in his 2003 shareholder letter. </p> <p>Trott, who helped arrange Berkshire's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83bf493c-89ba-11dd-8371-0000779fd18c\">life-saving investment</a> in Goldman during the 2008 crisis, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/426b861f-8c67-385e-af82-30b26d832526\">left the bank</a> the following year. Buffett has also moved on, dumping the last of his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc7816bb-fbff-4b68-89f5-b186ad2e7ee8\">Goldman shares in 2020</a> as part of a broader pullout from US banks including<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8f9c368-2a3c-490e-a289-ec8a1216f943\"> <strong>Wells Fargo</strong></a> and <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>. Berkshire remains a top shareholder of <strong>Bank of America</strong>, <strong>American Express </strong>and <strong>US Bancorp</strong>.</p> <p>DD has a hunch that Buffett's $27mn discount could also have something to do with the 25-day “go-shop” period included in Berkshire's offer — during which Alleghany could solicit a better offer. </p> <p>It's a rare concession from Berkshire, which is famous for avoiding bidding wars. Buffett walked away from opportunities to place counter offers for <strong>Tech Data</strong> against<strong> Apollo</strong> in 2019,<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/29/warren-buffetts-latest-attempt-to-put-his-cash-to-work-is-thwarted.html\"> per CNBC</a>, and rejected buying jeweller <strong>Tiffany &amp; Co </strong>when it was facing advances from French conglomerate <strong>LVMH</strong>, the FT<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9da47898-237a-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b\"> revealed</a> several years ago.</p> <p>But<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c69bd27-902c-4975-a895-b9c2c33bfd74\"> as we explained on Tuesday</a>, the longtime relationship between Buffett and Alleghany's chief executive <strong>Joseph Brandon</strong> — who decades ago was considered a top pick to succeed Buffett at the helm of Berkshire — could mean the nonagenarian stockpicker is eager to avoid any potential conflicts of interest surrounding the merger.</p> <p>Not explicitly snubbed by Buffett's final offer is law firm <strong>Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher</strong>, Alleghany's legal adviser on the takeover. Berkshire will also be shelling out legal fees on its own adviser <strong>Munger, Tolles &amp; Olson</strong>, the former firm of Berkshire's vice-chair and Buffett's right-hand man <strong>Charlie Munger</strong>.</p> <p>Better to be a lawyer than an investment banker, in Buffett's book anyway.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>Former UK chancellor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf936f46-a6c8-4ca2-b0db-95fc1155a42f\"><strong>George Osborne</strong></a>; the <strong>US Treasury</strong>'s former under-secretary of domestic finance<strong> Jeffrey Goldstein</strong>; and <strong>Canapi Ventures</strong> founding partner<strong> Dan Beldy</strong>; have joined the board of fintech start-up<strong> Capitolis</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>UK ecommerce group <strong>THG </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93c67eea-9341-4afe-a83a-0c1fea51d0e4\">has appointed</a> former<strong> ITV </strong>chief <strong>Charles Allen</strong> as its new chair following the splitting of its executive chair and chief executive roles in October.
