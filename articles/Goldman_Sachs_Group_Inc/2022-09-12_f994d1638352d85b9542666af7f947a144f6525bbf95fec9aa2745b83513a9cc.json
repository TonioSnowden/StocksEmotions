  "title": "Russian Swap Auction Prompts Strong Investor Demand for Moscow's Debts; Goldman Sachs placed bids on more than $1.3 billion in Russian sovereign debt for clients during Monday's auction",
  "text": "<p>to freely trade over the next week to best allow for investors to settle their swap contracts.</p><p>Often, debt investors will buy credit-default swaps as insurance to protect themselves in case a borrower can't pay them back. After a borrower is ruled in default, an auction takes place where investment banks determine how much swap protection buyers are owed and allow them to sell the underlying bonds if they choose. Protection sellers can also bid to buy the defaulted bonds to try to offset their own losses.</p><p>Investors who either bought or sold protection against a Russian debt default indicated a net interest to buy around $500 million in Russian bonds in Monday's auction, reflecting a bid of $1.3 billion to buy bonds and around $800 million of swap investors putting in requests to sell, auction data show.</p><p>The greater demand from buyers in the auction suggests that some protection sellers wanted to cap their exposure by inflating the price of Russian bonds, thereby reducing what they owe to protection buyers, said Fabien Carruzzo, head of the derivatives group at law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis &amp; Frankel LLP.</p><p>\"Presumably some also saw an opportunity to buy those assets, or buy more of them, at a favorable price given the limited trading window.\"</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in total bid for more than $1.3 billion worth of Russian sovereign bonds on behalf of swap investors, making it the only participating investment bank to put in a net positive order to buy Kremlin-backed debts, auction data show. There is around $1.5 billion of swaps referencing Russia outstanding, suggesting that Goldman Sachs transacted on behalf of nearly all outstanding protection sellers.</p><p>With the $500 million imbalance between swap investors looking to buy bonds and investors trying to sell, outside investors holding Russian bonds filled the gap during the second phase of the auction, unloading roughly $500 million of bonds at a price of 56 cents on the dollar.</p><p>Some of the largest providers of credit insurance, such as Pacific Investment Management Co., likely drove most of the demand in Monday's auction, looking to offset their swap losses through purchases of bonds that could appreciate in value, analysts say.</p><p>The exemption to normal sanctions policy gives all U.S. investors the ability to buy and sell Russian debt over the next seven days. However, the net impact of sanctions is likely to push more paper into the hands of foreign investors, Mr. Carruzzo said.</p><p>\"I'm not sure if the OFAC restrictions achieve the aim of sanctions, because the result is just a transfer of existing Russian debt from U.S. holders to foreigners at a discount,\" he said, referring to the Office of Foreign Assets Control agency of the U.S. Treasury Department.</p><p>Monday's auction took place more than three months after Russia was ruled in default on a bond that triggered credit-default swaps, when Russia's sovereign bond traded close to 20 cents on the dollar. Russia outright defaulted a few weeks later on its bonds after it missed roughly $100 million in payments due to foreign bondholders.</p><p>As Russian bond prices have increased, protection buyers have expected lower payouts from their swaps, which offer recoveries in line with market prices at the time of the auction, investors said. The industry body responsible for overseeing the credit-default swap market delayed scheduling an auction until it received regulatory approval to trade Russian bonds from the U.S. Treasury.</p><p>Although Russian sovereign bonds rallied over the summer months, there are some early indications that the Kremlin's windfall from sales of oil and gas is beginning to abate. Russia's total budget surplus fell to 137 billion rubles, equivalent to $2.3 billion, in the first eight months of the year, compared with a surplus of 481 billion rubles reported through July, according to Russia's Ministry of Finance.</p><p>Write to Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com</p>",
