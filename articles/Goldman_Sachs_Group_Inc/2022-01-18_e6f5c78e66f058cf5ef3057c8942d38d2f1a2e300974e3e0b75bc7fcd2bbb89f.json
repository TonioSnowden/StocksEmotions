  "title": "Crude prices tap 2014 highs after Abu Dhabi oil facility attack, and Goldman calls for Brent above $100 by 2023",
  "text": "<p>March Brent crude&#xa0;BRN00BRNH22,&#xa0;the global benchmark, added $1.09, or 1.3%, at $87.58 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, after last week's 5.3% weekly advance. Brent prices were also trading at levels not seen since October 2014.</p><p>Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen claimed responsibility for an attack on an oil facility in Abu Dhabi that killed three people on Monday and caused a fire at the capital of United Arab Emirates's international airport. The UAE is the world's eighth largest oil producer, and instability in the Gulf can spark concerns of supply shortages.</p><p>Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs rolled out higher oil price forecasts, setting a 2023 Brent spot target of $105 a barrel in 2023, with 2022 headed for $96 a barrel, it said.</p><p>“Robust fundamentals have reversed last year's oil price melt-down, with the market remaining in a surprisingly large deficit as the Omicron demand hit is so far smaller (and likely briefer) than that of Delta exc. China,” said a team of commodity analysts led by Damien Courvalin.</p><p>And while a hit to Chinese demand may be big due to the impact on its economy from its zero-COVID policy — Goldman estimates a 500,000 barrel per day hit in the first half of 2022 — the bank sees that offset by strong demand in the final quarter of this year, gas-to-oil substitution and “supply disappointments.”</p><p>“Net, we expect inventory draws to narrow but persist through 1Q22, with the global surplus in 2Q22 smaller than seasonal at 0.4 mb/d [400,000 barrels per day]”, said Courvalin and the team.</p><p>And by summer, OECD oil inventories will be at their lowest since 2000, along with a historic drop in spare capacity from oil cartel OPEC and its partners. “At $85/bbl, the market would remain at such critical levels, with insufficient buffers relative to demand and supply volatilities, through 2023,” he said.</p><p>Elsewhere in the energy markets, February gasoline&#xa0;RBG22 rose 0.8% to $2.437 a gallon, after gaining 5.2% last week. February heating oil&#xa0;HOG22 rose nearly 2% to $2.685 a gallon, climbing 6.1% last week.</p><p>Natural-gas futures, meanwhile, saw their February contract&#xa0;NGG22ease 0.1% to $4.259 per million British thermal units. Prices rose 8.8% last week.</p>",
