  "title": "World News: Chinese Cities Intensify Bid To Cool Off Housing Prices",
  "text": "<p>Among the most aggressive is a plan, thought to be China's first, to manage home-sale values by setting guidance prices for banks to follow when approving mortgage loans.</p><p>Under the new rules, maximum prices were laid out by authorities in an 84-page document released in February that listed more than 3,500 property developments citywide. Several banks pledged to limit financing on properties whose sales prices exceeded the prescribed values.</p><p>Buyers could pay more if they wanted to, but doing so would mean spending more up front for down payments, potentially curbing demand. Several large online property-listing platforms also removed advertised prices on existing homes and replaced them with the government's guidance prices.</p><p>The guidance-price policy follows other steps, including a crackdown on business loans misused for buying homes and moves to limit crowdfunding to pay for properties. Authorities are also trying to fix loopholes that allowed people to get around earlier restrictions, such as limits on the number of properties married couples can own.</p><p>Shenzhen officials are planning to supply more land this year for new housing, which they hope will ease price pressures.</p><p>Other cities, including Nanjing and Hefei, both in eastern China, are implementing localized policies to manage the market, including restrictions on purchases in popular districts.</p><p>Such surgical measures, as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. described them in a recent report, offer Chinese leaders more flexibility to contain property prices without the blunt force of economywide moves such as raising interest rates, which could overshoot and derail China's economic recovery.</p><p>\"Policy makers do not want to see house prices either rising sharply or falling sharply,\" Goldman Sachs said. A further surge in housing prices would worsen affordability, while a slump could destabilize the economy the report said.</p><p>Some of the moves seem to be working. Shenzhen's secondhand-home market cooled off quickly in April, with nearly 4,900 existing apartments sold, down 28% from March and nearly 36% from a year earlier, according to data from Wind. The number declined further to around 3,000 units in May, down 65% from a year ago.</p><p>Secondhand-housing prices in the city stopped climbing in April from a month earlier, after rising 1.7%, 0.9% and 0.4% in the first three months this year, respectively. In Hefei, transactions of secondhand homes dropped 27% in April, a month after the new rules kicked in.</p><p>There are a few cities where prices are falling, notably in northern China,where the heavy-industry-led local economy isn't performing as well as that of the more dynamic south.</p><p>But nationwide, the property boom is showing little sign of abating. In April, new-home prices in 70 major cities grew at the fastest pace in eight months, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics.</p>",
