  "title": "Business News: Ozy Media, in an About-Face, Says It Plans to Relaunch",
  "text": "<p>The announcement is an abrupt reversal for Ozy Media, which has been engulfed in a crisis over the past week in the wake of a New York Times article that raised questions about its business. On Friday, Ozy Media's board released a statement saying it was closing Ozy's doors \"with the heaviest of hearts.\"</p><p>A spokesman for Ozy Media said the company has begun reaching out to former employees to bring them back, adding that staffers who don't want to return to Ozy Media would be \"paid whatever is owed to them.\"</p><p>The company plans to resume producing newsletters this week and production of its videos this month, the spokesman said. It plans to resume its Ozy Fest event series next year, he said.</p><p>\"The bottom line is that we hit a bump in the road but are committed to getting past this moment and renewing our commitment to being the kind of media company that delivers amazing content about topics and people that are too often overlooked,\" the Ozy Media spokesman said.</p><p>The New York Times on Sept. 26 reported that Ozy Chief Operating Officer Samir Rao impersonated an executive from Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube on a February fundraising call with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Mr. Watson last week attributed Mr. Rao's behavior to a \"mental health issue,\" calling the incident \"deeply unfortunate.\"</p><p>Ozy Media's board said last week it had hired the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP to \"conduct a review of the company's business activities.\" That investigation is no longer continuing, a person familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Last week, Marc Lasry, an investor in Ozy and the co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, stepped down from Ozy's board, and Katty Kay, an Ozy recruit who was a correspondent and anchor for the BBC, left the company.</p><p>Company employees lost access to their email accounts after Ozy Media said it was closing, another person familiar with the matter said, and many employees still haven't been contacted about potentially rejoining the company, the person said.</p><p>In an interview with CNBC on Monday, Mr. Watson said he reached a decision to relaunch Ozy after speaking with advertisers, investors and employees, but didn't name them.</p>",
