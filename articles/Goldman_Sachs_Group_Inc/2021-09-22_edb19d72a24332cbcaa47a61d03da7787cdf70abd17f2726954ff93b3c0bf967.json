  "title": "Imperial Capital-Backed Eye-Care Company Weighs Sale; Keplr Vision maintains a network of nearly 300 optometry practices across 35 states",
  "text": "<p>Keplr is projected to have adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $100 million this year, according to the people. If reached, a deal could be valued around $1.8 billion, according to some of the people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The company partners with or purchases medically-focused optometry practices in the U.S. and provides them with operational support. This includes offering optometrists business-management services—back-office resources like payroll and human resources—as well as supply-chain management support. The company currently works with 281 practices across 35 states, according to the company's website.</p><p>Keplr traces its roots back to 2005 with the opening of a single optometry clinic, according to its website. After Imperial Capital first backed the business in 2017 through its Fund VI, Kepler was formed in 2019 through a merger of two optical groups backed by the Toronto firm, according to Imperial's website.</p><p>The American optometry industry has seen steady growth over the past five years because of rising demand for services from an aging U.S. population and increasing awareness of eye health, according to a report by research firm IBISWorld Inc. Industry revenue has grown at an annual rate of 1.4% over five years to reach $18.4 billion this year, and the pace is forecast to accelerate to 3.1% per year to reach $21.5 billion in 2026, the report said.</p><p>IBISWorld estimated 65% of the U.S. population requires vision-correction products, including corrective lenses and services such as annual eye exams.</p><p>The continuing need for services produces a stable revenue base for the industry, IBISWorld said, though it noted pricing pressure from online eyewear and contact-lens providers. The sector also is expected to benefit from an increasingly insured population and gradual recovery in healthcare spending and the economy in general following the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>Private-equity firms have been active in the vision and eye-care sector over the years, driving consolidation, but IBISWorld said the four biggest industry groups combined account for less than 10% of total revenue. The research describes the industry as fragmented, with more than 35,700 independent practices operating this year.</p><p>There were 38 deals involving eye-care businesses and financial sponsors in 2019 with an aggregate value of almost $12.08 billion, the most since at least 2010, according to data provider Dealogic. The pace declined last year, with 11 such transactions worth about $3.46 billion, the data show. This year through Monday Dealogic data reflect nine deals with a total value of $958 million.</p><p>In late 2019 Partners Group Holding AG purchased optometry and ophthalmology services group EyeCare Partners LLC in a deal that valued the business at $2.2 billion including debt, according to a person familiar with the matter at the time. In 2019 the merchant-banking division of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. announced it bought the company that manages MrEyeDr. optometry practices. That deal was valued at $2.7 billion including debt, according to a previous report by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Keplr itself has been active in acquiring and partnering with numerous optometry groups across the country. In August the company partnered with Visionary Partners, a group that operates optometry clinics across Nevada, Oregon and Washington, according to the company's website.</p><p>Write to Laura Cooper at laura.cooper@wsj.com</p>",
