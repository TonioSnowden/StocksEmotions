  "text": "<p>   When old-fashioned funding sources like bank loans grew harder to access, developers became more reliant on presales of unfinished apartments. These made up 26% of the debt in Nomura's tally. </p><p>   Presales are often recorded as contract liabilities, an item that shows up on the balance sheets of sector heavyweights such as Evergrande, Country Garden, China Vanke, Sunac China Holdings Ltd. and China Resources Land Ltd. For these five combined, contract liabilities have jumped 42% in the past three years to the equivalent of $341 billion as of June, FactSet data show. </p><p>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts recently estimated Evergrande had the equivalent of $156 billion of off-balance-sheet debt and contingent liabilities, including mortgage guarantees to help home buyers get loans. </p><p>   The other problem for developers, and for China's property market overall, is the way some of the trends that fueled the boom are reversing. </p><p>   China's population is aging. Its workforce has been shrinking since 2012, and official forecasts last year predicted the total population would peak in 2027. </p><p>   Homeownership is already over 90% for urban households in China, among the highest in the world, according to Mr. Rogoff and Ms. Yang. They cited earlier Chinese research saying that as of late 2018, 87% of home purchases were by buyers who already had at least one dwelling. </p><p>   Julian Evans-Pritchard, an economist at Capital Economics, said his firm has looked at developers' ability to meet their obligations from cash holdings and doesn't think most are on the brink of default. But, citing changing demographics and reduced internal migration, he said \"they're going to be fighting over a shrinking pie.\" </p><p>   Deng Lin, a 33-year-old lawyer in Shanghai, planned to sell two properties she owns to buy a bigger one after she gave birth to twins this summer. The government's clampdown on debt risks derailing her plan of upgrading to a three-bedroom, which she estimates could cost up to $1.86 million. </p><p>   \"There's simply too much uncertainty in the market,\" she said. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Anniek Bao contributed to this article </p><p></p>",
