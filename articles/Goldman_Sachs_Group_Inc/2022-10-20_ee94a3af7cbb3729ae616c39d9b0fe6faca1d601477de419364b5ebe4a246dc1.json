  "title": "Indonesia's Battery Success Runs on China and Coal; Indonesia is clambering up the battery sector supply chain in a way that raises sticky questions for the West",
  "text": "<p>It's in processing that this success is most obvious. Indonesia will account for 23% of global nickel processing capacity by 2025, up from 12% in 2020, becoming the second-largest processor of nickel compounds needed for electric vehicle batteries, according to Rystad data. China's share will increase from 44% to 52%. Finland, Japan and the U.K. will see their market share shrink.</p><p>Besides nickel processing, Foxconn and LG, among others, have also announced plans to actually build some batteries in Indonesia.</p><p>Sadly for those who like EVs but dislike coal, however, most of Indonesia's nickel output is so-called Class 2 nickel: a low-purity type which requires a lot of energy to process. In Indonesia, that means burning a lot of coal. According to an April Goldman Sachs report, more than 50% of nickel globally is produced with coal-fueled energy—and unsurprisingly, coal-rich Indonesia is the country that relies on it most of all. Such concerns may be one reason Western firms have been relatively hesitant to invest there.</p><p>China, the world's largest market for electric vehicles, has stepped into the gap. Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt (ZHC), Weiming Group, CNGR Advanced Material, Chengtun Mining Group, Ningbo Lygend Mining and GEM have all announced nickel investments and projects in the country. China has begun importing far more intermediate nickel products from Indonesia, notes Rystad. China's imports of the mineral jumped to 26410 metric tons in the first half of 2022 from a mere 2995 metric tons during the same period in 2019. Such intermediates can in turn be used to produce nickel sulfate, a key component to produce nickel rich batteries.</p><p>The arrangement suits both parties. China gets access to a steady stream of intermediates while Indonesia gets know-how and a chance to diversify its mining-centric economy. Chinese companies already have experience in ore extraction and mineral processing in Indonesia, notes Susan Zou of Rystad, and have equivalent strength in nickel chemical processing which can help to build up Indonesia's midstream battery supply chain.</p><p>The rush to be both environmentally friendly and secure supply chains from China is already raising lots of sticky questions for companies and Western governments—which are under pressure to achieve both in short order. Increasingly, they will face scenarios where they must choose between one or the other.</p><p>Indonesia's Battery Success Runs on China and Coal</p>",
