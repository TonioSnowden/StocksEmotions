  "title": "Business News: GM Asks for Vaccine-Status Disclosures --- Auto maker says data will guide safety plans; requirement doesn't apply to UAW workers",
  "text": "<p>GM hasn't required employees to get the Covid-19 vaccine. In its earlier note to workers, GM said the disclosures would help the company determine the overall immunity of its workforce and guide its safety protocols.</p><p>\"The level of immunity is an important factor in determining when GM may need to increase or be able to relax or rescind certain Covid-19 safety protocols,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Hess, GM's corporate medical director.</p><p>GM said it plans to use the data to determine how many people it can staff in a certain facility, for example, or whether it should ease or strengthen practices such as masking and social distancing.</p><p>The requirement to disclose vaccination status doesn't apply to GM's 46,000 U.S. factory workers, who are represented by the United Auto Workers. Such a requirement would likely be subject to negotiation with the union.</p><p>UAW President Ray Curry said the union considers vaccination status to be protected medical information and would prefer to protect their members' privacy. Any vaccine status disclosure the union would consider would need to be voluntary, he said during a media briefing Thursday.</p><p>Mr. Curry said the union is encouraging all members to get the Covid-19 vaccine and is also pushing for booster shots for those who are eligible. On broader vaccine mandates, Mr. Curry said the UAW is open to discussions with companies on such efforts, but maintained the union's stance that members should have the freedom to choose, including declining the vaccine for religious, personal and medical reasons.</p><p>Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google have said that they will require that all employees at their U.S. campuses be vaccinated. Delta Air Lines Inc. this week said unvaccinated workers would be assessed a $200 monthly health-insurance surcharge.</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. this week said employees and visitors entering its U.S. offices beginning Sept. 7 must be vaccinated.</p><p>---</p><p>Nora Naughton contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
