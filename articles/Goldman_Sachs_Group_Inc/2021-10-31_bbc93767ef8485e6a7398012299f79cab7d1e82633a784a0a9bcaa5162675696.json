  "text": "<p>Manufacturing activity in China shrank for a second straight month in October, as the fallout from the country's property sector downturn and energy shortages spreads through the world's second-biggest economy.</p> <p>China's manufacturing purchasing managers' index was 49.2 in October, below the 50-point threshold that indicates expansion rather than contraction, official data showed on Sunday.</p> <p>The PMI data mark the latest sign of a worsening economic slowdown as weakening property construction activity and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75871eb7-360e-40b5-9bb3-d65fbf649ee7\">high commodity prices</a> hit industry. </p> <p>The gauge's decline from 49.6 in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37062e9d-a933-4f61-9115-1f9c4dd1c6d2\">September</a> also reflects electricity supply disruptions at factories, from those in China's northern rustbelt to the high-tech workshops in Guangzhou and Shenzhen. </p> <p>The deteriorating economic backdrop is heaping pressure on Xi Jinping and his top planners in Beijing just as the country's president is pushing ahead with an unparalleled series of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bacf9b6a-326b-4aa9-a8f6-2456921e61ec\">economic and social reforms</a>.</p> <p>Under the banner of advancing “common prosperity”, Xi has spearheaded an aggressive regulatory overhaul, hitting companies and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c89594c1-1d85-4dda-9e67-55c775bd6c9a\">business leaders</a> across <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4b2c109-75dd-4c04-8291-ae4a5016063b\">property</a>, technology, gaming, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0d19bf4-4e5b-4f61-8905-d1abc9d2664c\">entertainment</a> and education. </p> <p>But the flurry of poor economic data is sparking fresh calls for a softer policy approach from Beijing, particularly for the property sector, which has also been hit by debt problems at developer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d20b52bb-a129-4623-859f-ab91f699c542\">Evergrande</a>.</p> <p>The level of contraction in manufacturing activity in October was worse than the 49.7 reading expected by analysts polled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>The surveys also showed “inflationary pressures continued to escalate” as price rises accelerated for industrial inputs including petroleum, coal, chemical materials and metals, Goldman Sachs analysts noted. </p> <p>The figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Sunday come two weeks after data showed economic growth in the third quarter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b543917f-6d4b-4a4a-b684-b5ddc1e8050c\">slumped</a> to its slowest pace in a year.</p> <p>According to Gavekal Dragonomics analysts, what was an anticipated slowdown in China following the post-Covid boom of the first half of 2020 has evolved into a “shocking loss of economic momentum”.</p> <p>Clouding the country's growth outlook was a plethora of supply-side difficulties. Problems ranging from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4fda08e3-6bc1-4ae8-9f80-83c48ac2b40e\">computer chip shortages</a> to overstretched logistics networks in the early months of the pandemic have since been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5174e592-1f0b-4334-91ab-aa89ceff3821\">compounded</a> by electricity supply disruptions and sporadic lockdowns in response to coronavirus outbreaks.</p> <p>However, the Gavekal analysts said, “the real problem is on the demand side”, pointing to a worsening property sector downturn stemming from tough financial and regulatory policies.</p> <p>“Since the property sector is the most important driver of cyclical activity, overall growth will weaken further in [the fourth quarter] and into 2022,” the Gavekal analysts said in a research note ahead of the PMI release. </p> <p>They said Beijing had “signalled only a marginal relaxation of its strict property policies”.</p> <p>China's non-manufacturing PMI slipped to 52.4 from 53.2 in the month before, while the composite index also edged closer to contraction territory, at 50.8 from 51.7. </p> <p>Citi analysts warned that the weaker manufacturing activity was being accompanied by sharp rises in producer prices. </p> <p>“As a result of power rationing and related supply constraints, the features of ‘stagflation' have become more evident and would limit near-term policy options,” they said, referring to the economic challenge of a scenario of slowing growth and rising prices.</p><p>Source: Edward White in Seoul 2021 'China manufacturing slows as property and energy woes hit economy' FT.com 31 October.
