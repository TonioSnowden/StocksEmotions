  "text": "<p>There are further signs of a slowdown in the global economy today as the impact of Covid hurts economic activity in China, the war in Ukraine hits Europe's economy and the Federal Reserve's efforts to control rampant inflation threaten a recession.</p> <p>In China, the country's main gauge of consumer activity, retail sales, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41f80bad-0eca-445a-a7fb-922262611311\">slumped 11.1 per cent year on year</a>, compared with forecasts of a 6.6 per cent fall from economists polled by Bloomberg. Industrial production, which underpinned China's rapid economic recovery from the initial Covid shock in early 2020, dropped 2.9 per cent.</p> <p>The data are the most striking sign yet of the rising economic toll from China's zero-Covid strategy. Dozens of cities and hundreds of millions of people across China have been placed under full or partial lockdowns as part of a policy that is expected to have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9318db50-e0c3-4a27-9230-55ff59bcc46e\">deep ramifications for global supply chains</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Europe <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf9794ee-6b0d-4a50-a433-91cd76fab7a0\">the EU cut its growth forecasts</a> and lifted its inflation outlook as the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine exacts its toll on the EU economy.</p> <p>Both the EU and euro area are forecast to expand by just 2.7 per cent this year — well shy of the previous expectation of 4 per cent, forecasts published by the European Commission today showed.</p> <p>Inflation is expected to surge above 6 per cent in both the EU and euro area this year, with some central and eastern European countries likely to see double-digit price rises in 2022.</p> <p>Last week, European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde signalled that she would support raising the main interest rate in July, paving the way for the first increase in the eurozone for more than a decade.</p> <p>In the US, where annual inflation is running at the highest level for four decades, there is a “very, very high risk” of a recession, according to former Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein. </p> <p>Blankfein, who stepped down as Goldman chief in October 2018 but remains the Wall Street bank's senior chair, said in an interview with CBS yesterday that corporate America and US consumers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce305e83-fd33-4ed2-9662-8e04764d83a2\">should be prepared for a recession</a> as the Federal Reserve tightens policy to combat high inflation.</p> <p><em>Do you think the US is heading for recession?

The suspected gunman, 18-year-old Payton Gendron, was “a lone gunman, armed with weapons of war and a hate-filled soul”, President Joe Biden said yesterday. Meanwhile, police arrested a 60-year-old suspected of shooting one person dead and injuring five others at a meeting <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/multiple-victims-reported-person-detained-california-church-shooting-rcna28937\">of Asian church goers</a> in southern California.

We apologise for an error.</em></p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Let the Fed put money where it is really needed</strong> The Federal Reserve was designed just over 100 years ago for one discrete task — to ensure that the country has enough money to keep the economy growing to its full potential. But over that time it has come to backstop the global market system, Rana Foroohar argues. As a result, she says, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c8636e7-ef65-453f-88f7-20bc941fa849\">the Fed is trying to walk an impossible line</a>.</p> <p><strong>Is Elon Musk too big to regulate?</strong> Many on Wall Street saw Elon Musk's tweet on Friday announcing he was putting his purchase of Twitter “temporarily on hold” as a way of softening up Twitter's management to negotiate a lower offer. But legal experts said it was another example of the Tesla chief executive flouting securities regulation, leaving him open <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48549850-891a-4079-b7c0-29b537cb5a91\">to the SEC's nuclear option</a>.</p> <p><strong>Crimea could be Putin's tipping point in a game of nuclear chicken</strong> The US thinks Vladimir Putin would authorise the use of nuclear weapons only if he perceived an existential threat to Russia. But what would qualify as such a threat, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d632cae8-f06d-4f9d-9d90-f1cd0dfd7a70\">asks Malcolm Chalmers</a> of the Royal United Services Institute.</p> <p><strong>Inflation returns to haunt Brazilians </strong>Inflation in Brazil is nowhere near as bad as it was in the 1980s and 1990s, when supermarkets would remark prices twice a day to keep pace with the rising prices but at 12 per cent, it is now at an almost two-decade high. And the spectre of Brazilian hyperinflation <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/999cdb06-d068-4fd0-9892-1781101d59d3\">was never entirely banished</a>.</p> <p><strong>Bonuses are outdated in the age of knowledge work</strong> The idea of paying for performance is deeply ingrained. But what if the concept is flawed? Two studies suggest it is, Pilita Clark writes, given that work is more complex and collaborative than ever. Offering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f397fb4-da63-4ccd-bac1-343828540bf2\">bonuses can even backfire</a>.</p> <h1>Music</h1> <p>After the scourge of the pandemic, the first Summer for the City festival is offering New Yorkers a summer to “rejoice, reclaim and remember” with an outdoor dance floor and free installations. Here are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/872c184a-b4e2-4363-a057-06a7daa2b2d5\">a selection of other classical concerts</a> taking place across the US this summer.</p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, George Russell and Sophia Smith 2022 'FirstFT: More signs of global economic slowdown' FT.com 16 May.
