However, economists said in response to the jobless claims data that the labor market hasn't deteriorated enough to impact the Fed's calculus on interest rates.</p><p>\"We expect layoffs to rise gradually over coming months in response to Fed tightening, which will weigh on demand,\" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note to clients. \"But for now, having faced persistent labor shortages, businesses are still holding on to rather than letting go of workers.\"</p><p>Investors are awaiting Friday's jobs report, which is expected to show the economy added 275,000 jobs in September, compared with 315,000 new positions added in August, according to a survey polled by Dow Jones.</p><p>See: What Friday's jobs report means for stocks. Investors shouldn't expect a break from the market whiplash, say strategists</p><p>Oxford Economics expects the employment growth to decelerate more quickly in the fourth quarter as employers reduce hiring against a backdrop of a slowing economy and declining corporate profits, but they don't see outright job losses until 2023, when the economy enters a mild recession.</p><p>\"If the details are as expected, the September jobs report will provide evidence of only a minor easing of labor market tightness and wage pressures and won't alter the course of monetary policy,\" wrote Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, in a Wednesday note.</p><p>John Porter, chief investment officer at Newton Investment Management, also expects Friday's employment report is just \"a part of the mosaic\".</p><p>\"We're not sure that tomorrow's jobs number will be seminal data point that certainly lingers in investors minds for more than a day or two,\" Porter told MarketWatch on Thursday.</p><p>See:Hiring and job creation seen falling to a 1 1/2-year low in U.S. September jobs report</p><p>Energy stocks were the best performers on the S&amp;P 500 index, rising 1.5%, at times the energy sector was the only one of the index's 11 sectors that was trading in the green.</p><p>Oil prices and the shares of oil and gas companies got a boost as oil prices continued to climb following the OPEC+ producers' agreement — announced on Wednesday — to cut their production quota by 2 million barrels a day.</p><p>The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&amp;P 500 energy sector, rose 1.5%.</p><p>West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures due in November CL00 CL.1 CLX22 rose 69 cents, or 0.8%, to settle at $88.45.</p><p>Treasury yields rose in the wake of Kashkari's comments, which helped to weigh on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Yincreased to 3.819%.</p><p>Looking ahead, investors will receive the next update on inflation next Thursday when the consumer-price index for September is due to be released. Also next week brings the start of the third quarter corporate earnings reporting season which may give a clearer view of whether the economy is weakening in the face of rising interest rates.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Twitter Inc.
