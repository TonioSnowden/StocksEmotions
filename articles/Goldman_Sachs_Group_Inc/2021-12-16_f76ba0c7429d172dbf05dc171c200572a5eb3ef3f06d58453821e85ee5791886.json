  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> Linklaters has become the latest corporate law firm to water down its traditional “lockstep” pay model for partners, adapting to fierce competition to attract and retain top talent by offering larger pay cheques to outstanding performers. More <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eed76b45-cca4-474e-a451-127fc62eb702\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Revolutionising the road to hell with Elon Musk</h2> <p><strong>Elon Musk</strong> possesses a unique set of skills. </p> <p>He has triggered a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb4d1d64-5d90-4e27-b77f-6e221bc02696\">seismic shift</a> towards electric vehicles against the odds, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e3deff5d-4c55-4e6b-a3e8-e6b5fa6ff162\">launched humans into orbit</a> from US soil for the first time in almost a decade, and moves stock markets with a single tweet.</p> <p>The first two of these reasons are why the Financial Times has named the controversial entrepreneur its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92c399ac-1fe9-4c05-b72d-2323f33cfd64\">Person of the Year</a>. </p> <p>But for every extraordinary feat of engineering by Musk (his Starlink satellite network and Starship rocket are poised to push the boundaries of broadband and space flight, respectively), he also stuns the world with his uncanny talent for taking a blowtorch to social norms.</p> <p>The Tesla chief's polarising personal brand has earned him <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d561078-37c7-4902-a094-637b81a26241\">no shortage of enemies</a>. But it has also galvanised an army of devoted fans and investors, who regard him as a visionary freed from innovation-squashing societal conventions.</p> <p>“I'm just trying to get people to Mars, and enable freedom of information with Starlink, accelerate sustainable technology with Tesla, free people from the drudgery of driving,” he told the FT's Richard Waters. </p> <p>“It's certainly possible that the road to hell to some degree is paved with good intentions — but the road to hell is mostly paved with bad intentions.” His own intentions, he insists, are to be a force for good.</p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1470519292651352070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1470519292651352070%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2Fa7f75d25-d710-4aaa-9f57-49e24d67744d\">https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1470519292651352070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1470519292651352070%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2Fa7f75d25-d710-4aaa-9f57-49e24d67744d </a> <p>His efforts are beginning to pay off. After struggling for years to prove it could be financially viable, Tesla's profit margins <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4eb7504e-94ef-4f99-937d-807aa159b282\">are sturdy</a>. His private space group <strong>SpaceX </strong>has cruised ahead of rival <strong>Jeff Bezos</strong>'s<strong> Blue Origin</strong>, which Musk attributed to his company's superior engineering chops before delivering some signature snark.</p> <p>Bezos “does take himself a bit too seriously”, he told Richard. “As a friend of mine says, he should spend more time at Blue Origin and less time in the hot tub.”</p> <p>Mischievous jabs aside, Musk's bad-boy persona risks drowning out far more serious issues.</p> <p>Six women who worked at Tesla are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/14/tesla-sexual-harassment/\">suing</a> the electric-car maker for alleged sexual harassment and discrimination, per The Washington Post, following <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-sued-by-second-female-worker-over-sexual-harassment-retaliation-2021-12-10/\">two similar suits</a> filed against the company earlier this month. Former female employees of SpaceX have <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22831380/spacex-employees-harassment-workplace-misconduct-elon-musk\">also come forward</a> alleging a culture of sexual harassment, according to The Verge.</p> <p>On the technological front, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53349313\">grand claims</a> by Musk of Tesla's self-driving capabilities have fallen short. SpaceX could fall into the red if it fails to produce the engines needed to meet its rocket launch plans and put enough satellites into orbit. “Bankruptcy is not out of the question,” Musk says. “So we should not be complacent or entitled.”</p> <p>With so many sides to Musk shown to the public, it can be hard to tell which are real.</p> <p>“I'm not saying I don't make foolish tweets, of course I do. There are times when I shoot myself in the foot. But you know, on balance, it's entertaining and interesting, informative, whatever,” he said, after borrowing the famous line the movie <em>Gladiator</em>: “Are you not entertained?”</p> <p>Read Richard's full interview with Musk <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a7f75d25-d710-4aaa-9f57-49e24d67744d\">here</a>.</p> <h2>France's beautiful game looks to private equity for a lifeline&#xa0;</h2> <p>It hasn't been a happy time in the world of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bc47209-c8ad-496b-a2a6-5d2813ba3609\">French football</a> lately, with violent incidents erupting at stadiums, clubs' finances teetering because of the pandemic, and the collapse of its television broadcasting deal last year. </p> <p>But <strong>Vincent Labrune</strong>, the savvy operator who heads France's top-flight football league, has a plan that he hopes will turn things round. He wants private equity investors to plough €1.5bn into the sport. </p> <p>The <strong>Ligue de Football Professionnel </strong>is holding an auction to select a buyer for a minority stake in a newly created company that will market the TV and online broadcast rights and sponsorship rights for the sport. </p> <p>The model is very similar to the one its Spanish counterpart<strong> La Liga</strong> set up when it agreed to a €2bn financing deal with<strong> CVC Capital Partners</strong>. </p> <p>That was voted through last week despite opposition from two of Spain's most successful clubs, <strong>Real Madrid</strong> and <strong>FC Barcelona</strong>, who made a last-ditch bid to derail it. &#xa0;</p> <p>France's LFP received more than 10 non-binding “expressions of interest” from private equity groups this week, insiders told DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Leila Abboud in Paris, and has selected a handful to move on to the next phase with binding offers expected by late February. </p> <p>CVC and<strong> Silver Lake </strong>are among the chosen few. While many private equity firms have mulled possible sports deals, the pair are among a very small number with a serious record. </p> <p>CVC has the La Liga stake and Silver Lake owns a stake in <strong>City Football Group</strong>, which owns<strong> Manchester City</strong> and has a stake in the <strong>French Ligue 1</strong> club <strong>Espérance Sportive Troyes Aube Champagne</strong>. </p> <p>The question of what exactly they're bidding for is a little more complicated. </p> <p>The league wants €1.5bn of capital and is asking bidders to say what percentage of its new commercial rights vehicle they want in exchange for the sum. </p> <p>So rather than choosing the highest price, it will have an incentive to choose the bidder that demands the smallest stake, equating to the highest valuation and letting the league keep as much power as possible. People close to the process say the league is ready to sell up to 15 per cent of the new company. </p> <p>Much remains to be hashed out, including the governance of the new commercial rights company and how many board seats the new investor would get versus the league or the clubs. </p> <p>Even more controversial could be how the proceeds will be divided among the clubs. Bidders have been asked to consider whether their cash should be distributed differently between clubs than funds are at present. </p> <p>That raises the potentially explosive notion that the more successful teams could get a bigger share of the cash. Given that sports deals tend to mesh ego, money and power even more closely than other mergers and acquisitions, it's worth watching. </p> <h2>Private capital's battle for screen time</h2> <p>With ecommerce decimating brick-and-mortar retail space and the continued spread of coronavirus emptying offices anew, huge real estate investors like <strong>Blackstone</strong> and <strong>TPG</strong> have had to tap their creativity to find property deals with a good risk and reward. </p> <p>As <strong>Disney</strong>, <strong>Apple</strong>, <strong>Netflix</strong>,<strong> Amazon</strong> and others spend tens of billions of dollars on their entertainment arsenals, these private capital firms have uncovered a lucrative play by buying movie and television production studios in Hollywood, New York, London and Toronto, betting that demand for this studio space far outstrips supply.</p> <p>“This is one of the most exciting themes we are pursuing in our real estate business globally,” <strong>Nadeem Meghji</strong>, head of real estate for Blackstone Americas, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ce18e41-0593-4438-a62c-cb8c2456eb92\">told the FT</a>. “We are still in the early innings of the megatrend around content creation and within the studio business as well.”</p> <p>Investors including Blackstone and TPG committed more than $4bn in recent months to acquire sound stages in the US and Europe, as lesser-known firms ride the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2aef6e5-37d3-4b93-99d5-8964bc6d647b\">content boom</a> straight to the bank.</p> <p><strong>Hackman Capital</strong>, a Los Angeles real estate investor, partnered with <strong>Square Mile Capital</strong> on deals worth more than $2bn in November alone, putting its deal total at more than $7.5bn since 2018.</p> <p>Classic Hollywood institutions like <strong>Paramount</strong>,<strong> Universal</strong> and <strong>Warner Bros</strong> could soon see their historic lots scouted by private equity investors, among others. The question remains as to whether the price will be right for studio stalwarts to open their doors to Wall Street. </p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Katie Haun</strong>, the first female general partner in<strong> Andreessen Horowitz</strong>'s history, is leaving the venture capital firm to form her own fund.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Rothschild &amp; Co</strong> has appointed <strong>Jennifer Moses</strong> as a member of its supervisory board. She has held a number of previous roles, including as a managing director in M&amp;A at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>Law firm <strong>Cadwalader</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cadwalader.com/news/news-release/cadwalader-elects-9-new-partners-and-promotes-23-new-special-counsel-and-counsel\">has elected</a> nine attorneys to the firm's partnership and 23 attorneys to special counsel and counsel. </p></li>  <li><p>Law firm <strong>Quinn Emanuel </strong><a href=\"https://www.quinnemanuel.com/the-firm/news-events/quinn-emanuel-welcomes-largest-ever-new-partner-class/#rootNodeId=1054&amp;pageNumber=1&amp;byNewsType=\">has elected</a> 18 new partners globally.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Raising the stakes </strong>Loose oversight has made Malta the capital of Europe's €24.5bn online gambling industry.
