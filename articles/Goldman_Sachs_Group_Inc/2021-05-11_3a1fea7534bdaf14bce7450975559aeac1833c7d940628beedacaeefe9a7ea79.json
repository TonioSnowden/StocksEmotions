  "text": "<p>Brown Brothers Harriman, though a familiar name, is not one of those financial institutions that resonates in the collective imagination as a synonym for the power of money. It is not a Rothschild, a JPMorgan or a Goldman Sachs. Part of this is intentional: the Irish immigrant Alexander Brown and his sons, who established the firm in the early 1800s, were men of influence, but were committed to professional discretion and Christian humbleness. </p> <p>But that is not the whole story, as Zachary Karabell's <em>Inside Money</em>, an engaging history of the bank and its place in American financial history, lays out. Brown Brothers Harriman's name does not ring out as it did a century ago because the firm stuck to a model of banking and finance — a tight partnership structure and a culture of prudence and service — that has been overtaken by another in the past half-century. Ever larger public companies, answerable only to the market and fixed on profit maximisation, dominate finance now. In the process, Karabell suggests, something valuable has been lost. </p> <p>Brown Brothers began as a Baltimore cloth merchant, evolved into a trade finance house, then an investment bank, next a commercial bank, before finally becoming what it is today: a private partnership operating primarily in the dull but crucial custody banking sector — the plumbing, as it were, of asset and investment ownership. Along the way, it played important roles at most of the crucial junctures in American economic history, from the railroad boom to the convulsions of the great depression.</p> <p>Through it all, the firm took to heart the advice its patriarch gave to his four boys: “Shoemaker, stick to thy last.” Focus on what you are good at, do it right, and keep quiet about it. It was good advice in the early years, when Brown Brothers came to dominate the risky transatlantic trade finance business — which it entered because of the necessity of underwriting cotton shipments to Britain on behalf of farmers in the American South. In the early 19th century, Brown Brothers' letters of credit became as close to a universally accepted commercial currency as America had. That was because of the partners' deserved reputation for risk management. The Browns were picky about who they did business with and never bet all on a single venture.</p> <p>The partners were neither saints of capitalism nor perfect managers. Their early business was rooted in slavery. The business took a bailout loan from the Bank of England when it faced a run during the panic of 1837; its deep integration with transatlantic commerce made it too big to fail. The bank's almost complete domination of the finances of Nicaragua in the 1910s, in partnership with the US state department, is a remarkable case of economic imperialism. It controlled Nicaragua's national bank (located in Connecticut!), its currency, and its rail system, all but directly managing its economy. The partnership became Brown Brothers Harriman because, during the depression, paper losses left it in dire need of capital, which it received by merging with the investment bank run by W Averell Harriman, who had inherited a vast fortune from his railroad baron father. </p> <p>But the firm's reputation for competence and influence grew steadily through it all, to the point that in the 1940s, Harriman and another partner, Bob Lovett, were tapped for some of the most important civilian roles in the war and in the years that followed. Ultimately they became secretaries of commerce and defence, respectively. Both men showed exceptional competence as part of the tight-knit Wasp elite that dominated the war's industrial and diplomatic fronts. </p> <p>They and other “wise men” were less useful during the cold war and, indeed, contributed to the disaster in Vietnam. But the salient feature of power elites is that failure or mediocrity does not derail them. Another partner, Prescott Bush, parlayed his connections into a Senate seat, with which he did approximately nothing. But his son and grandson become presidents. </p> <p>Karabell, who has worked in banking himself, tells a brisk and muscular story, though at times one wishes for more financial details on the firm and its biggest deals (the partners' famous discretion may have made this impossible, however).</p> <p>Brown Brothers Harriman began to fade in the 1970s, partly because of flagging energies but also because it remained a small, risk-averse partnership while high finance was becoming a game of speed, scale and aggression. Ironically, Brown Brothers was forced to split by the Glass-Steagall regulations in the 1930s, and its investment bank spin-off, Harriman Ripley, ended up (though a series of ill-fated mergers) as Drexel Burnham Lambert, where Michael Milken began the junk-bond revolution, made a fortune and landed in jail. As other Wall Street banks went public and grew vast, Brown Brothers continued in its genteel fashion, finally settling into the quiet niche where it remains today.</p> <p>Karabell thinks we would live in a more stable world if more companies practised this form of “sustainable capitalism”, where bankers risk their own capital, not that of shareholders, and where service, not scale, is the main goal. There is surely truth in this, but it may also be that as technology and globalisation created unprecedented demands for capital at the end of the 20th century, only larger, more aggressive banks could get the job done, and the crashes of 1999 and 2008 were a cost that had to be paid. </p> <p>There is another possibility, too. The prudence, discretion, and moderation that defined Brown Brothers for much of its history reflected the values of the business community it served and, to an extent, of America as a whole. As those values have lost their vitality, it was inevitable that the banking industry would change. It may be, in other words, that we get the bankers we deserve.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1594206619/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1594206619&amp;linkId=1d0810056a16c5c3524eaf6ffce87dee\"><strong>Inside Money</strong></a><strong>: Brown Brothers Harriman and the American Way of Power</strong> by Zachary Karabell, <em>Penguin Press, RRP$30, 448 pages</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/robert-armstrong\"><em>Robert Armstrong</em></a><em> is the FT's US finance editor</em> </p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: Robert Armstrong 2021 'Inside Money by Zachary Karabell — the price of stability' FT.com 11 May.
