  "title": "ECB could hike 50 basis points in September, says central bank's Holzmann in first comments after meeting: report",
  "text": "<p>Holzmann said the region's high inflation ran a risk of becoming entrenched if the central bank does act appropriately, Reuters reported. He also reportedly said he thought markets reacted well to Thursday's meeting.</p><p>The ECB announced that its bond-buying program would cease in July, and that it would increase interest rates by 25 basis points, adding that a September interest rate increase was expected. European stocks tumbled Thursday and continued to lose ground on Friday, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index XX:SXXP down 1.4%</p><p>Bond yields across Europe soared on Thursday as the ECB looked ready to line up with other central banks around the world in tightening policy to get a grip on high inflation.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year German bund BX:TMBMKDE-10Y was down 2 basis points to 1.41% after soaring to levels not seen since 2014 on Thursday. The yield on Italy's 10-year bond BX:TMBMKIT-10Ycontinued to climb, up another 4 basis points to 3.644% after reaching highs not seen since 2018. The spread between the two has surged as investors have demanded more to hold Italian paper.</p><p>Read: ECB failure to address 'fragmentation' threat raises risk of steep bond-market selloff: economists</p><p>Goldman Sachs economists said they now expect the ECB will hike interest rates by 50 basis points in both September and October.</p><p>\"[Thursday's] communication—for a larger hike if the inflation outlook does not improve—points to a low bar for a 50bp rise in September. Moreover, our inflation projections (which are significantly above the ECB's in coming months), rising wage pressure and the likelihood of further increases in long-term inflation expectations suggest that another 50bp increment in October is likely,\" said a team led by chief European economist Sven Jari Stehn.</p><p>He said a 25 basis point hike is likely for December given they see inflation slowing in the fourth quarter of this year, with the deposit rate approaching the lower end of the 1% to 2% range for the neutral policy cited by ECB officials. Goldman expects three more 25 basis point hikes in 2023.</p><p>\"The main risk to the ECB's accelerated hiking cycle is the re-emergence of debt sustainability concerns, especially in Italy. While President Lagarde [Thursday] remained vague about the features of a potential backstop and confirmed that the ECB does not have a 'strike price' for backstopping periphery yields, we would expect the ECB to pause the hiking cycle and activate a backstop in the event of a sovereign stress scenario,\" said Stehn.</p><p>Europe was grappling with high inflation and supply chain issues from the pandemic when Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, triggering a surge in commodity prices and even more pressure on prices and the region's economies.</p><p>ECB could hike 50 basis points in September, says central bank's Holzmann in first comments after meeting: report</p>",
