  "text": "<p>The summer sport schedule is hotting up, with the <strong>National Basketball Association</strong> finals under way between the <strong>Boston Celtics</strong> and the <strong>Golden State Warriors</strong> and the <strong>National Hockey League</strong>'s Stanley Cup playoffs just around the corner. I'll be in Boston next week for games 3 and 4 of the basketball classic, where the Celtics will have home-court advantage after taking the first game in San Francisco.</p> <p>In the meantime, we turn our eyes to a mash-up of traditional European sport with American ownership, dissecting <strong>Gerry Cardinale</strong>'s plans for <strong>AC Milan</strong> and why <strong>Liberty Media</strong>'s turnround efforts at <strong>Formula One</strong> still have a way to go. Do read on — <em>Sara Germano, US sports business correspondent</em></p> <h1>The executive who bought AC Milan from Elliott Management</h1> <p>It has been a busy week for <strong>RedBird Capital Partners</strong> founder Gerry Cardinale.</p> <p>The former <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> executive capped off a busy acquisitive streak over the past two years with an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89d6336f-a0e1-434a-aa05-cf0fcccd7190\">agreement to purchase</a> AC Milan, the newly crowned <strong>Serie A </strong>champions, from US hedge fund <strong>Elliott Management</strong> for €1.2bn.</p> <p>The deal, signed on Wednesday, closes the curtain on an ambitious and ultimately successful <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc87fbe0-e5e9-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59\">turnround period</a> under Elliott, which seized the club from Chinese businessman <strong>Li Yonghong </strong>after he defaulted on his debts in 2018. Stay tuned for more FT coverage on how the RedBird-Elliott deal came together.</p> <p>For Cardinale, acquiring AC Milan — known as the <em>Rossoneri</em>, the Italian translation for the red and blacks — places him on a growing list of Italian-Americans scooping up football clubs in the motherland that includes <strong>Stephen Pagliuca</strong> of <strong>Atalanta BC</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07b8a172-5381-41a7-b427-a8280bb95102\"><strong>Rocco Commisso</strong></a> at <strong>ACF Fiorentina</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e3d6c75-902d-4c89-b9b4-f0d2f25debf2\"><strong>Kyle Krause</strong></a> of <strong>Parma</strong>. </p> <p>The Goldman alum is no stranger to sports ownership. After spending more than 20 years at the Wall Street bank, where he was a partner and helped steer its private equity investing business, he launched RedBird in 2014 and set off on an eight-year dealmaking streak.</p> <p>RedBird's assets include French football club <strong>Toulouse FC</strong>, which recently clinched promotion to the top-flight <strong>Ligue 1</strong> for the 2022-2023 season, and a 10 per cent stake in <strong>Fenway Sports Group</strong>, the holding company that owns <strong>Liverpool Football Club</strong> and the <strong>Boston Red Sox </strong>baseball team. </p> <p>RedBird also holds stakes in <strong>SpringHill Company</strong> — the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6bdef028-0a0c-4733-abe2-8ed76d319a9e\">media and entertainment</a> vehicle founded by <strong>LeBron James </strong>and <strong>Maverick Carter </strong>— and, in cricket, the <strong>Indian Premier League</strong>'s <strong>Rajasthan Royals</strong>.</p> <p>Cardinale's tenure at Toulouse, along with his pre-RedBird experience creating <strong>YES</strong>, the <strong>New York Yankees</strong>' regional sports network, form the clearest blueprints for his goals at Milan, according to a person familiar with his thinking. </p> <p>His priorities include stabilising the club's on-pitch performance to keep them at or near the top of the Serie A table, and building a suitable media and entertainment platform around what has historically been one of the most successful clubs in Europe. </p> <p>Meanwhile, on Wednesday a special-purpose acquisition company established by RedBird and <em>Moneyball</em> manager <strong>Billy Beane</strong> <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/seatgeek-redball-spac-merger-called-135629551.html\">called off</a> its proposed acquisition of ticketing platform <strong>SeatGeek</strong>, just hours before the Spac shareholders were set to vote on the deal. It comes amid a broad cooling in the Spac market, which has fallen out of favour among dealmakers of late.</p> <p>Scoreboard still has questions. How will Cardinale, who, despite being the descendant of Italian immigrants, doesn't speak the language, navigate the country's labyrinthine municipal systems to either build a new stadium or upgrade <strong>San Siro</strong>, the club's home that it shares with crosstown rivals <strong>Inter Milan</strong>? </p> <p>And with their first <em>scudetto</em> in more than a decade freshly in hand, how will Milan approach the summer's transfer market under new ownership?<br><br>The coming weeks will determine whether the ambitions of the club's new American owner clash with the reality of the Italian market. </p> <h1>Why the Formula One turnround isn't over</h1> <p>Imagine thinking anyone other than<strong> Bernie Ecclestone</strong> could run Formula One. <br><br>The former car salesman, who became a billionaire on the realisation that television money would transform the eccentric sport into serious business, ruled until <strong>Liberty Media</strong>, the investment group controlled by US tycoon <strong>John Malone</strong>, acquired F1 in an $8bn deal more than five years ago.</p> <p>Bernie was out, and the Americans who replaced him would have to prove themselves in a sport of firmly European tradition.</p> <p>An FT Special Report on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/business-of-F1\">Business of F1</a> assesses the turnround effort and what's left for Liberty Media to do.</p> <p>It has been no easy task, given that Ecclestone had ignored the rise of social media and prioritised older, wealthier fans. </p> <p><strong>Mercedes</strong>, co-owned by German automaker <strong>Daimler </strong>and Austrian team principal <strong>Toto Wolff</strong>, struck gold with a dominant car and a generational talent in British driver <strong>Lewis Hamilton</strong>. Most rivals didn't have the cash to keep up; those who had the money couldn't.&#xa0;</p> <p>Liberty Media's chief executive <strong>Greg Maffei </strong>knew it wouldn't be an instant revolution. The biggest teams initially resisted plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb7d0967-6fa1-47d7-b348-414a7f460ecc\">cap team expenditure</a> and distribute revenues more evenly throughout the grid. </p> <p>But the Covid pandemic changed the conversation. With a curtailed 17-race season and a fall in revenues, teams compromised on the proposals. </p> <p>Now, investors are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a5cb403-5430-49ec-a69c-150adfcbec7e\">buying into teams</a> thanks to a budget cap that limits spending and promotes profitability. New stars such as Mercedes driver <strong>George Russell </strong>are emerging, with younger fans getting to know the personalities behind the helmets thanks to <em>Drive to Survive</em>, a fly-on-the-wall series on <strong>Netflix</strong>.</p> <p>Even Liberty Media's push into America has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e623f1fa-fcee-42bd-91f0-100a4a33426f\">started to pay</a> off. Miami joined the calendar for the first time this season and Vegas will follow in November next year, adding to its usual US race in Austin.</p> <p>Still, Liberty Media must prove that the American craze is more than a fad. Pumping the breaks on this year's Russian Grand Prix resulted in losses of $40mn to $70mn and a reminder of the geopolitical risks of running a travelling circus.</p> <p>F1 must keep up with technological change, as stressed in <strong>James Allen</strong>'s fascinating interview with <strong>Ferrari</strong> chief <strong>Benedetto Vigna</strong>, while the sport must also prove its climate credentials with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aecac667-7de5-4e9b-a071-22773ff83e52\">sustainable fuel on the agenda</a>. Separately, Hamilton, the sport's only black driver, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/defad534-3c60-48d3-b937-82b5cc3bb815\">leading the conversation</a> on correcting F1's infamous lack of diversity.</p> <p>Liberty Media is sticking around nonetheless. “There's a lot of positive flywheels, I don't know we would want to exit,” says Maffei. “In an environment where a lot of businesses are challenged, it is pretty nice to have one that's about hitting on every cylinder.”</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>France <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d6d80c2-ff89-452f-bf81-b1152383d8bc\">apologised</a> for the chaos around the<strong> Uefa Champions League</strong> final in Paris, marred by mishandling of crowds outside the <strong>Stade de France</strong> ahead of <strong>Real Madrid's</strong> 1-0 victory over<strong> Liverpool.</strong> French police were filmed spraying tear gas at fans, including children, delaying the kick-off and raising deeper questions as France prepares to host the <strong>2023 Rugby World Cup </strong>and the <strong>Summer Olympics</strong> the following year.</p></li>  <li><p>Mercedes could stop supplying engines to one of its F1 team customers — <strong>McLaren</strong>, <strong>Aston Martin </strong>or <strong>Williams</strong> — because regulatory changes designed to protect the financial sustainability of smaller rivals limit what it can charge. <strong>Toto Wolff</strong>, shareholder and team principal, highlighted the changing economics of the sport in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/34ca7e31-11d5-45c6-9ef8-74d7130c4cb5\">an interview</a> with the FT's Frankfurt correspondent, Joe Miller.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Lester Piggott, </strong>revered throughout British horseracing, died at the age of 86. Read Colin Cameron's colourful <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32b302b0-d167-47be-957f-59012195d9bd\">obituary</a> of the jockey, whose victories at famous tracks such as<strong> Epsom</strong> cemented loyal public affection despite a conviction for tax evasion in 1987.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Cathy Engelbert</strong>, commissioner of the <strong>Women's National Basketball Association</strong>, said the league is hoping to name one or two expansion teams by the end of this year, <a href=\"https://theathletic.com/3343324/2022/06/02/wnba-expansion-possible-cities/\">according to The Athletic</a>. The expansion franchises, which tentatively would begin play during the 2024 season, come months after the league raised $75mn in its first-ever funding round, valuing it at $475mn.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Match point</h1> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OnHerTurf/status/1532400450405908483\"> https://twitter.com/OnHerTurf/status/1532400450405908483</a> <p>The <strong>French Open</strong> women's final this afternoon promises to be one for the ages, pitting former teenage <strong>Roland Garros</strong> champion and newly appointed world No. 1 <strong>Iga Świątek </strong>against <strong>Coco Gauff</strong>, the youngest woman to reach a Grand Slam final since <strong>Maria Sharapova</strong> in 2004. Upon her 6-3, 6-1 victory over Italy's <strong>Martina Trevisan</strong> in the semi-final, the 18-year-old American delivered a stark message after a spate of recent mass shootings back home: “Peace. End gun violence” she wrote on the on-court camera.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Meet the dealmaker who bought AC Milan from Elliott Management' FT.com 4 June.
