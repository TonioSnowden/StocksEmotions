  "text": "<p>Japan's biggest lender is climbing the rankings ladder of the US syndicated loan market. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group is one among local lenders seeking growth outside Japan. History suggests that reversing declining profitability from this strategy shift will not work.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/8028a38b-d7c9-45f5-a9b5-611124e4809a\">MUFG</a> is on track to overtake Goldman Sachs and Barclays for US loans this year, according to Bloomberg data. Local peers Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group and Mizuho already get more than a third of their earnings from overseas businesses. </p> <p>This results from necessity rather than choice. At home, Japanese banks struggle with low profitability amid rock bottom rates. The Bank of Japan has stuck with its negative 0.1 per cent target for short-term interest rates, and zero per cent for the 10-year government bond yield. </p> <p>Higher credit costs and fierce competition among the big three lenders hurt as well. Foreign-currency funding costs are rising amid the yen's crash to a fresh 24 year low. </p> <p>Japanese banks have sought profits salvation in the US market before. In the 1990s Nomura went from the bottom to the top of the rankings in commercial loans in the US. It also aggressively expanded its investment banking business there in the 2000s.</p> <p>Yet any gains from those US adventures have proved shortlived. Legal <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/nomura-agrees-pay-480-million-civil-penalties-misleading-investors-sale-residential\">disputes</a>, for example over residential mortgage-backed securities, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73ec854c-28f4-4625-b79c-9df5d390076d\">writedowns</a> have offset any gains in the region.</p> <p>The latest ticking bombs on the balance sheets of Japanese lenders could result from years worth of heavy betting on the US fixed income market. These are starting to unravel. Rapid US rate hikes are hitting the value of the lenders' foreign bond holdings as prices fall.</p> <p>Shares in MUFG are down a quarter in the past year and trade at less than half book value. Net income margin has already turned negative in the year to March.</p> <p>Dollar funding challenges, and higher costs overseas, can present more problems for Japanese lenders than its US peers. Japan's hunt for foreign growth could well bring more risk than reward.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Japan banks: cost of shifting to the US is high &#xa0;' FT.com 13 October.
