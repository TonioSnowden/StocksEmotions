  "text": "<p>   Ozy Media said it would cease operations, less than a week after a New York Times article raising questions about the company's business practices led to high-profile departures and a pullback from some major advertisers. </p><p>   \"At Ozy, we have been blessed with a remarkable team of dedicated staff. Many of them are world-class journalists and experienced professionals to whom we owe tremendous gratitude and who are wonderful colleagues. It is therefore with the heaviest of hearts that we must announce today that we are closing Ozy's doors,\" the board said in a statement issued Friday. </p><p>   The company had been through a whirlwind after the New York Times reported Sunday that Ozy Chief Operating Officer Samir Rao had impersonated an executive from Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube on a February fundraising call with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p><p>   Ozy Chief Executive Carlos Watson in a statement on Sunday said that Mr. Rao's behavior on the call stemmed from mental-health issues. </p><p>   Since then, Marc Lasry, an investor in Ozy Media and the co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks National Basketball Association team, stepped down from Ozy's board, citing a lack of relevant experience; Katty Kay, a high-profile Ozy recruit who was a correspondent and anchor for the BBC, left the company. </p><p>   In addition, several major advertisers of Ozy put their ad campaigns on hold, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. </p><p>   On Tuesday, Ozy's board said it has hired the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP to \"conduct a review of the company's business activities.\" </p><p>   The fallout had also spread to Ozy's investors. SV Angel surrendered its shares in Ozy, an unusual move for a venture-capital firm. Axios earlier reported SV Angel's move. </p><p>   Axel Springer, another Ozy investor, has said it supported the board's investigation into the company's business practices. </p><p></p>",
