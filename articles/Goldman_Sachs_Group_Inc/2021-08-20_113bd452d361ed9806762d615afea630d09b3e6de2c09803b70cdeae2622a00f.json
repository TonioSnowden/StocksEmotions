  "title": "If Your Oven Is Stuck on 350, Maybe It's in 'Sabbath Mode' --- Designed to help Orthodox Jewish users, feature confuses cooks of many faiths",
  "text": "<p>Technical support turned into a lesson in digital-age dogma.</p><p>In her effort to bake brownies, Ms. Glasscock, of Athens, Ga., discovered that she inadvertently turned on \"Sabbath Mode,\" a feature designed to freeze an oven's settings so observant Jews can abide by religious law restricting electricity on holidays. The Glasscocks tried to skirt that doctrine by flipping the circuit breaker -- a trick Sabbath mode is designed to override. They later turned to the Talmud of appliances, the manual, and pressed bake and broil buttons simultaneously for three seconds to revive the oven. \"I pray to God I never do it again,\" said Ms. Glasscock, a Presbyterian.</p><p>Technology is cooking up similar meltdowns in kitchens across the U.S. as software makes what was once a niche feature commonplace in mass-manufactured appliances.</p><p>Sabbath mode, a decades-old concept, is now available in about 85% of built-in ranges and nearly two-thirds of wall ovens, according to TraQline, a market-research firm that tracks the industry. Each passing year, manufacturers expand the availability to appliances from refrigerators to dishwashers, so they now make up almost a third of all machines.</p><p>In ovens, Sabbath mode disables the light and display, and allows people to set the temperature to warm food without shutting off. In refrigerators, the mode disables the lights and auto-defrost, as well as the water and ice systems.</p><p>The setting is increasingly leaving cooks unfamiliar with it in a stew of confusion.</p><p>Jewish law, known as halakha, forbids work on the Sabbath. From sundown Friday to sundown Saturday, observant Jews refrain from cooking and starting or extinguishing fires -- an ancient prohibition that rabbinic authorities extended to anything electrical.</p><p>\"We get complaints because Sabbath mode won't do anything I want on Sabbath,\" said Jonah Ottensoser, an engineer with the kosher-certification firm Star K, which helped develop the feature in 1997. Observant Jews can cook on religious holidays, so long as they don't start the oven -- or change its digital display -- so Mr. Ottensoser said a more accurate name would have been \"holiday mode.\"</p><p>\"But then people would be asking: What am I supposed to use this for? Thanksgiving? Christmas?\" Mr. Ottensoser said.</p><p>Many non-Jews don't realize the mode exists. Triggering it varies by make and model. On many of GE Appliances' ovens, it starts when bake and broil pads are pressed simultaneously, followed by pushing the delay start pad. That combination turns the temperature to the pre-ordained warming level of 350 degrees and puts a backward \"C\" on the display.</p><p>GE Appliances said all its cooking products are designed to operate safely in Sabbath Mode. The company said the ovens' safety design automatically turns off the oven if it detects the temperature is too high and that regulatory testing verifies the safety of leaving ovens and ranges on in Sabbath mode for multiple days.</p><p>People who accidentally activate it chalk it up to fidgety fingers or absentminded baking. Because the oven stops beeping and its display goes haywire, they immediately think the appliance is broken.</p><p>Justin Dearing's 8-year-old daughter -- a kitchen novice -- accidentally started Sabbath mode while setting a timer. He learned she evoked a higher power by posting a photograph of the display to Twitter. He was told to refer to the manual and figured out what happened. He says he wishes the oven would sound a warning by playing guitar licks from Black Sabbath. \"Then you would really know you pressed an unusual button,\" said Mr. Dearing of Cranford, N.J.</p><p>The kitchen flare-ups have occurred as faster chips and cheaper memory make it possible for manufacturers to develop software that turns everyday machines into bespoke appliances for ever-smaller niches of users. GE Appliances is making washers and dryers with audio guidance for the blind. LG is rolling out WiFi-enabled laundry machines that send notifications about \"over-sudsing.\" And some Whirlpool microwaves feature proximity sensors that enlarge or shrink the clock display based on where someone stands -- a blessing for the nearsighted and farsighted alike.</p><p>\"Whatever people can dream of is possible,\" said Kevin Nolan, chief executive of GE Appliances, a subsidiary of China's Haier Smart Home Co. The company bought the appliance business of General Electric Co. in 2016. \"Our driving force is to get closer to consumer needs and wants,\" Mr. Nolan said. \"That means greater personalization.\"</p><p>The 700,000 Orthodox Jews in the U.S. average 8 people per household and often have two ovens, two dishwashers and two sinks, so that they can abide by religious law that says they should keep meat separate from dairy, said Whirlpool Kitchen Brand Manager Katie Sadler. Brand loyalty with one family can multiply across future generations.</p><p>Serving that community led GE to collaborate with the Orthodox Union's kosher certification agency to bake a custom smart feature into appliances. A plug-in device called \"Shabbos Keeper\" sets ovens, refrigerators and more to the Jewish calendar and automatically disables lights and defrost settings during holidays and Sabbath. It's a capability that simplifies the kitchen routine of disabling appliances and reduces the risks of needing to repent over the complexities of today's wired world. \"We're trying to use technology to turn technology off,\" said Mr. Nolan.</p><p>Last year, Racheal Lembeck of Seattle went to get ice water from her Frigidaire Gallery refrigerator only to find the spigot had run dry. The dark fridge turned a light bulb off in her head: Sabbath mode had been set. To this day, she has no idea how it happened.</p><p>\"It was definitely a lot of laughs,\" said Jeff Lembeck, her husband.</p><p>Appliance makers receive dozens of calls each week from people like the Lembecks. Some people call Star K's helpline where Rivka Goldman walks them through how to turn Sabbath mode off while fielding a handful of questions about religion.</p><p>\"I imagine their eyes glazing over and thinking, 'My gosh. This is so weird,'\" Ms. Goldman said.</p><p>Star K President Avrom Pollak, who helped develop the setting, is baffled each time he hears of a gentile foiled by a Sabbath setting. \"It's not the easiest thing to get into,\" Mr. Pollak said. \"I have some in my house, and I don't even know how to do it.\"</p>",
