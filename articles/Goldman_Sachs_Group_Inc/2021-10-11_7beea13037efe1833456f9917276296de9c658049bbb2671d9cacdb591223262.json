  "title": "Derby's Take: Fed Down Two Hawks as Regional Bank Presidents Depart; The chiefs of the Boston and Dallas Fed banks had urged dialing back central bank support for the economy",
  "text": "<p>Both men left their respective banks after information from their institutions showed they were trading stocks and other investments while setting monetary policy. While the two banks say the trading was within their ethics, neither man received strong support from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and promptly announced their exits.</p><p>Messrs. Kaplan and Rosengren were both prominent voices at the Fed and have been hawkishly inclined to dial back the central bank's support for the economy in recent comments.</p><p>Mr. Kaplan, who worked at investment bank Goldman Sachs and rose to lead its investment banking division before leaving the firm in 2006, was one of the Fed's most followed figures on the intersection of monetary policy and financial markets. Mr. Rosengren, a career Fed employee who led his bank since 2007, was closely watched on monetary policy at all points and made a name for himself warning about issues involving financial stability, post-financial crisis regulatory reforms and real estate.</p><p>Both men were also willing to buck the views of their colleagues. Wrightson ICAP data shows Mr. Rosengren in 37 Federal Open Market Committee votes dissented six times, four times in a hawkish direction and two times in favor of easier monetary policy. Mr. Kaplan offered one hawkish dissent in 17 votes. His single dissent was noteworthy because he took issue with the Fed's new framework for monetary policy.</p><p>While both men have supported the Fed's aggressive work to offset the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, they were also early among policy makers in saying the time was approaching for the central bank to pull back on its asset buying. That view is now the consensus at the Fed and a reduction in its $120 billion a month in Treasury and mortgage bond purchases is pretty much a lock for the November FOMC meeting, based on comments by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.</p><p>Where the exit of the two regional Fed bank presidents could affect the monetary policy debate centers on their contributions to central bank forecasts, notably with regard to interest rates. While Mr. Powell has said repeatedly that interest rate forecasts, which feature a so-called dot plot mapping officials' expectations for rate increases, aren't an official forecast of the central bank, that isn't how markets and Fed watchers view the information.</p><p>At the last FOMC meeting in September, the collective view of officials moved forward the expected timing of the central bank's first rate increase from 2023 to next year. Officials also penciled in more increases in 2023 than they did at their June meeting. The Fed's median forecast is based on contributions by officials to the dot plot, so small shifts in personnel can pull the central bank's overall projection one way or another. The absence of two policy makers could alter this process in unpredictable ways.</p><p>Mr. Rosengren was on track to be a voting member of the FOMC next year and would likely have had his hawkish profile elevated due to that status, even though he was also on track for mandatory retirement due to his age. Mr. Kaplan, a voter in 2020, wasn't up for another rotation on the FOMC until 2023.</p><p>NatWest chief U.S. economist Kevin Cummins noted in research recently that with Messrs. Kaplan and Rosengren gone \"it now seems we will have two less hawks in 2022â€¦pending possible replacements.\"</p><p>Write to Michael S. Derby at michael.derby@wsj.com</p>",
