The focus on China comes amid a shift in US orientation away from Europe to a hegemonic conflict with Beijing.</p> <p>Stoltenberg, who is set to step down next year after almost eight years at the helm of Nato, told the FT:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“China is coming closer to us . . . We see them in the Arctic. We see them in cyber space. And of course they have more and more high-range weapons that can reach all Nato allied countries.”</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Do you think Nato is right to pivot towards China?
