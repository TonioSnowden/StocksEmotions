  "title": "Credit Markets:  Yields Fall as Investors Flee Risk  ---  Some question if the  Ukraine conflict will  have implications for  the Fed's policy outlook  ----  By Sebastian Pellejero",
  "text": "<p>   U.S. government bond yields fell Thursday as investors sought out haven assets following the Russian attack on Ukraine. </p><p>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note finished Thursday's session at 1.969%, according to Tradeweb, down from 1.976% Wednesday. </p><p>   Yields, which fall when bond prices rise, started to decline Wednesday night after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an offensive in Ukraine that he said was aimed at toppling the government in Kyiv and \"demilitarizing\" the country. Government bond yields then pared declines during the U.S. session. </p><p>   Investors typically sell riskier assets like stocks and buy safe-haven assets like Treasurys when war breaks out, expecting the conflict and possible sanctions to slow economic growth. Major U.S. stock indexes dropped at open Thursday following the Russian attack, but recovered later in the session, while stocks in Asia and Europe fell sharply. </p><p>   Thursday's yield fall reverses the recent U.S. Treasury market selloff, which pushed the 10-year yield above 2% for the first time since mid-2019. Many investors have been betting that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates and remove stimulus measures in an effort to fight high inflation, sending yields to their highest levels during the pandemic. </p><p>   Now, some are starting to question if Russia's attack on Ukraine may have implications for the Fed's policy outlook. </p><p>   A recovering labor market and high inflation should motivate the Fed to raise interest rates through the end of the year, but, in the near-term, Treasury yields will be stuck trading between geopolitical conflict and strong fundamentals, said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities. </p><p>   \"It's difficult to gauge where exactly yields shake out in the short-term,\" he said. </p><p>   Analysts and investors pay close attention to Treasury yields because they set a floor on borrowing costs and are a key input in financial models used to value stocks and other assets. This year's climb has helped drive up mortgage rates and contributed to declines in stocks and other speculative bets, including cryptocurrencies and unprofitable technology company shares. </p><p>   The conflict in Ukraine may differ from past events that led the Fed to delay tightening monetary policy because inflation has created a stronger and more urgent reason to tighten, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a Thursday note to clients. Geopolitical risks won't stop the Fed from raising rates by 0.25 percentage point at its coming policy-making meeting, though it lowers the odds of a 0.5 percentage-point rate increase in March, they added. </p><p>   \"Signs of problematic wage-price dynamics have already emerged and near-term inflation expectations are high,\" they said. \"For all of these reasons, the FOMC's plan to raise rates steadily looks less likely to be knocked off course.\" </p><p>   Federal-funds futures, which investors use to bet on central bank policy, recently showed a 13% chance that the Fed raises short-term interest rates by 0.5 percentage point at its policy meeting in March, according to CME Group, down from over 33% Wednesday. </p><p>   Short-term Treasury yields also fell following the Russian offensive. The yield on the two-year note, which tends to trade on investors' interest-rate expectations, dropped to 1.544% Thursday, from 1.598% Wednesday -- the highest closing yield since December 2019. </p><p></p>",
