  "text": "<p>US stocks turned lower on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by half a percentage point against a backdrop of cooling inflation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/us-equities\">Wall Street's</a> benchmark S&amp;P 500 closed 0.6 per cent lower following an afternoon of choppy trading, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite ended the day 0.8 per cent lower. Both indices had been down more than 1 per cent during Fed chair Jay Powell's press conference.</p> <p>The moves followed gains in the previous session after US consumer price <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/us-inflation\">inflation</a> eased more than expected in November to its lowest level in almost a year.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2e1baae-60b3-4719-98ba-e932acb5a285\">Fed's unanimous decision</a> on Wednesday took its so-called target range for interest rates to 4.25 per cent to 4.5 per cent. It also ended a string of larger 0.75 percentage point increases as the US central bank aggressively tightened monetary policy to curb inflation.</p> <p>Members of the Fed's rate-setting committee are now expecting borrowing costs to stand at 5.1 per cent by the fourth quarter of next year.</p> <p>Markets were on Wednesday pricing in expectations that interest rates in the world's largest economy would peak at 4.9 per cent in the spring, up from 4.8 just before the Fed announcement.</p> <p>The Fed announcement came alongside a revised “dot plot” of officials' individual interest rate projections, signalling support for further tightening next year.</p> <p>Policymakers also updated their inflation to 3.5 per cent for the end of 2023, versus their estimates in September of 3.1 per cent.</p> <p>“If you consider that the Fed doesn't want financial conditions to loosen, the dots are very much in line with what you'd expect,” said Ashish Shah, chief investment officer of public investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.</p> <p>“The market maybe expected a lower inflation forecast for 2023 after the last two prints we have seen,” Shah added. “Either this is the Fed not updating its forecast, or — what is more likely — this is the Fed saying that they expect inflation to be sticky and they will stay the course.” </p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 is on track for its biggest three-month gain since the second quarter of 2020, having risen by about 12 per cent since the start of October, though some analysts doubt how long left the rally has to run.</p> <p>“Given stocks don't typically see a turning point until rate cuts are on the horizon, we still don't believe a sustained rally is likely over the next three to six months,” said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, before the Fed announcement.</p> <p>In government bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note, which tracks growth expectations, slipped 0.03 percentage points lower to 3.48 per cent. The two-year yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, edged down 0.01 percentage points to 4.22 per cent. Yields fall as prices rise.</p> <p>Treasuries had rallied on Tuesday after the softer than expected consumer price index data, which gave a reading of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d03d6abe-b305-4e45-b528-01f93671b4be\">7.1 per cent</a> for November — down from 7.7 per cent in October.</p> <p>The dollar fell 0.4 per cent against a basket of six peers, after dropping in the previous session. </p> <p>An index tracking the US currency has drifted lower in recent weeks but remains more than 8 per cent higher for the year to date, buoyed by the Fed's rate rises and its traditional status as a haven in times of economic and market stress.</p> <p>Elsewhere in equity markets, the regional Stoxx Europe 600 closed flat and London's FTSE 100 slipped 0.1 per cent, despite UK inflation slowing to 10.7 per cent in November, down from 11.1 per cent in October. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Kate Duguid in New York</em></p><p>Source: Harriet Clarfelt in New York and George Steer in London 2022 'US stocks turn lower after Fed raises rates by half a percentage point' FT.com 14 December.
