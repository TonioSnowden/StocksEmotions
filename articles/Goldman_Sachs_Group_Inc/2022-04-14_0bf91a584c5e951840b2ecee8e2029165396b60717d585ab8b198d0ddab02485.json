  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs reported a 42 per cent drop in profits in the first quarter as a surge in trading activity failed to compensate for a cooling in the dealmaking boom. &#xa0;</p> <p>The bank on Thursday reported net income of $3.9bn, or $10.76 per share, down from $6.8bn, or $18.6 per share, in the same period last year. </p> <p>The drop was smaller than analysts had forecast, with estimates for quarterly net income of $3.3bn, or $9.02 per share, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Net revenues for the first quarter totalled $12.9bn, down from $17.7bn a year earlier but ahead of analysts' expectations for $11.87bn.</p> <p>“It was a turbulent quarter dominated by the devastating invasion of Ukraine. The rapidly evolving market environment had a significant effect on client activity as risk intermediation came to the fore and equity issuance came to a near standstill,” David Solomon, Goldman's chief executive, said in a statement. </p> <p>Investment banking revenue was down 36 per cent at $2.4bn, lagging estimates for $2.5bn. Rival JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2eb49e29-dbf8-4d5f-be40-94915ae5e6d0\">reported</a> a 32 per cent drop in investment banking revenue. &#xa0;</p> <p>Wall Street started the year braced for a slowdown in dealmaking activity following a blockbuster 2021 supported by buoyant markets and stimulus measures. The slowdown, though, has been worse than expected. Bank executives have blamed Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent market volatility. </p> <p>Revenues in Goldman's trading division, which has benefited from the recent market volatility, were up 4 per cent at $7.87bn, remaining above pre-pandemic levels and well ahead of analysts' forecast for $5.86bn. JPMorgan's trading revenues fell 3 per cent to $8.75bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>The bank's fixed income trading revenues were $4.7bn, well ahead of estimates for $3.1bn, while revenues from equities were $3.1bn, also beating expectations for $2.7bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>In the quarter, Goldman also provisioned $561mn for credit losses, which it said reflected its growth in credit cards, individual impairments on wholesale loans and “the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical concerns”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Goldman's stock was trading up 1.6 per cent in pre-market trading in New York.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2022 'Goldman's first-quarter profits drop as dealmaking fades ' FT.com 14 April.
