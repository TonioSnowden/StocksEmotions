  "text": "<p>Credit Suisse is preparing legal action against collapsed family office Archegos Capital after a scathing independent report into the bank's $5.5bn resulting loss found the bank had probably been “deceived” by Archegos but that its staff also ignored risks and lacked “competence”.</p> <p>The report by law firm Paul Weiss, which was published on Thursday morning, said the losses were the result of a “fundamental failure of management and controls” in Credit Suisse's investment bank and a “lackadaisical attitude towards risk”. But it added Archegos had also probably “deceived” Credit Suisse.</p> <p>Credit Suisse was the worst hit of several investment banks that collectively <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c480d5c0-ccf7-41de-8f56-03686a4556b6\">lost more than $10bn</a> when Archegos collapsed this spring.</p> <p>Combined with the hit from the failure of finance company Greensill Capital a few weeks earlier, Credit Suisse has had one of the most difficult six months in its 165-year history.</p> <p>The two crises led to the liquidation of $10bn of investment funds, its largest ever trading loss, a spate of senior executive departures and the threat of legal action from clients.</p> <p>Credit Suisse chief executive Thomas Gottstein told the FT that the Paul Weiss report contained some “hard facts” about Credit Suisse's shortcomings. But when asked about the possibility of legal action, he added that the bank had “legitimate claims against Archegos — this is the basis on which we are acting”. </p> <p>David Mathers, the bank's chief financial officer, had earlier told journalists: “We intend, on behalf of our shareholders, to pursue all potential avenues for recovery.” </p> <p>Among the 172-page report's findings was that in summer 2020, Credit Suisse's potential exposure to Archegos was more than 25 times greater than the bank's risk limits. Yet staff in the prime brokerage division successfully argued that Archegos should be evaluated under the bank's “bad week” scenario rather than the more draconian “severe equity crash” scenario.</p> <p>At the time, a Credit Suisse risk analyst raised concerns to his supervisor about the prime broking staff, saying “the team is run by a salesperson learning the role from people” he did not “trust to have a backbone”.</p> <p>The report also criticises Credit Suisse for failing to learn lessons from the default of another client, hedge fund Malachite Capital Management, in March 2020, which led to losses of $214m for the bank.</p> <p>“It seems likely that Archegos deceived CS and obfuscated the true extent of its positions, which Archegos amassed in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic,” the report states.</p> <p>“That said, the business and risk [division] had ample information well before the events of the week of [Archegos's collapse] that should have prompted them to take steps to at least partially mitigate the significant risks Archegos posed to CS.”</p> <p>In response to the report, Credit Suisse said it was improving risk management. It added that, after reviewing the roles played by 23 people, it had fired nine members of staff — including the two heads of its prime services business — and imposed $70m of penalties on staff, including clawing back bonuses.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8062ef53-790f-4470-99d5-265335a72334\">Archegos has hired restructuring and insolvency advisers</a>, as well as lawyers and public relations advisers since the meltdown in March wiped out the bulk of its $10bn assets under management. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>The bank reported a 78 per cent fall in profits for the second quarter on Thursday. Its investment bank bore the brunt of the decline, with revenues down 41 per cent to $1.7bn compared with a year earlier, as it steered clear of more risky business.</p> <p>Net income for the second quarter fell from SFr1.2bn to SFr253m. Credit Suisse shares were down just over 3 per cent in early trading on Thursday.</p> <p>Analysts had expected reduced revenue growth, because of reduced risk-taking in response to the scandals. They had also predicted a longer-term decline in earnings following a number of senior departures and a hit to client confidence.</p> <p>Credit Suisse's operating expenses fell 1 per cent year on year, which the bank said was mainly because of the cuts to staff bonuses in the fallout from Archegos and Greensill.</p> <p>The $5.5bn loss stemming from the collapse of Archegos is especially embarrassing for Credit Suisse because, as the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/429f2cd2-db55-42b8-a65c-a228cdb3089d\">FT reported</a>, the bank made just $17.5m from the relationship last year, despite extending billions of dollars of credit to the family office. </p> <p>Since former Lloyds Banking Group chief executive António Horta-Osório joined as chair three months ago promising a wholesale review of risk management, strategy and culture at the bank, Credit Suisse has started to strengthen its risk management.</p> <p>It <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66f59140-da4f-4d41-9800-7092e48a505b\">has poached</a> two Goldman Sachs executives to oversee risk management and technology, while also forming a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4cf0dfb2-2128-437a-bb60-1cffc053a8d0\">new group</a> to monitor trading risk in its investment bank.</p> <p><strong>​Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53796bc3-12c0-42bf-83ca-fd7ef5f04891\"><em>Archegos fallout puts swap trades in spotlight</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53796bc3-12c0-42bf-83ca-fd7ef5f04891\"><em>From Oliver Blower, Chief Executive, VoxSmart, London EC2, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Owen Walker, European banking correspondent 2021 'Credit Suisse prepares legal action against Archegos' FT.com 29 July.
