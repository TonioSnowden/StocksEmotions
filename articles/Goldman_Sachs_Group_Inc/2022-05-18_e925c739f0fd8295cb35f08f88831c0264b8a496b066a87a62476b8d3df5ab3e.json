  "title": "Visa's 'more defensive' stance makes it well suited for choppy times, Goldman Sachs says; Goldman is bullish on Visa, Mastercard, and FIS",
  "text": "<p>\"While V is clearly exposed to overall macro trends in spending, we are incrementally more constructive on Visa's US-centric, debit-heavy business mix, which we see as more defensive in times of greater macro uncertainty relative to MA's more international and credit-centric business,\" he wrote in his note to clients.</p><p>Nance set a $282 price target on shares of Visa, with the target about 38% above current levels.</p><p>As for Mastercard, Nance noted that the company is set up well to benefit from its \"multi-rail\" strategy that extends beyond debit and credit cards, and he argued that Mastercard deserves to trade at a multiple that's a \"modest premium\" over Visa's, given Mastercard's more robust earnings growth.</p><p>Though he said that Mastercard \"represents an attractive combination of long-term growth, margin expansion, and capital returns,\" Visa is his preferred name given its skew toward debit and the U.S.</p><p>Nance initiated Mastercard's stock with a $460 price target, which is about 36% above recent levels.</p><p>He began coverage of several other payment-oriented names as well, slapping a buy rating on shares of Fidelity National Information Services Inc. FIS, while taking a neutral stance on shares of Fiserv Inc. FISV, Global Payments Inc. GPN, Shift4 Payments Inc. FOUR, and PAR Technology Corp. PAR.</p><p>\"Within the large-cap acquirers, we favor FIS, as we believe its banking business should benefit from an acceleration in technology spending, and we also favor its enterprise and e-commerce focused merchant business.\"</p><p>Nance also assigned a sell rating and $18 price target to shares of Western Union Co. WU</p><p>\"With management conducting a strategic review of the company's approach and looking to diversify away from its legacy business by offering a broader suite of financial services to its global immigrant customer base, we believe WU's strong margins/capital allocation could come incrementally under pressure as the company invests in the highly competitive neo-bank space,\" he wrote.</p><p>Visa's 'more defensive' stance makes it well suited for choppy times, Goldman Sachs says</p>",
