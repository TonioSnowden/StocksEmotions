  "text": "<p>BlackRock Inc., which has been raising its second secondary investment fund with a $4 billion target, is grappling with the fallout from the departure of three senior executives who led the nascent strategy, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Last week, BlackRock said it dismissed Steve Lessar, Konnin Tam and Veena Isaac after the three managing directors told the New York asset manager that they planned to leave its private-equity partners group for Apollo Global Management Inc. Apollo, also in New York, is trying to set up its own secondary investment strategy.</p><p>BlackRock's dismissal of the three executives has resulted in their loss of carried interest, or the share of profits the trio would have earned from the fund's investments, two people familiar with the matter said. One person said the three had given notice of their plans to depart from the world's largest asset manager on March 24.</p><p>The three helped run BlackRock's secondary investing group, known as Secondaries &amp; Liquidity Solutions, or SLS, within its private-equity arm. The SLS group raised about $3 billion for the strategy's debut fund just last year and now faces new fundraising hurdles because of the departures.</p><p>The market for secondary transactions ballooned last year, with total transactions more than doubling to reach $134 billion in value from $60 billion in 2020, according to a report from investment bank Evercore Inc. Part of the New York firm's business involves advising on secondary transactions.</p><p>BlackRock dismissed the three \"after learning of their intention to depart the firm in a coordinated fashion,\" according to an internal memo sent by Edwin Conway, global head of BlackRock Alternative Investors, and Russell Steenberg, global head of BlackRock Private Equity Partners, and seen by WSJ Pro Private Equity. \"The action we took reflects how seriously we take our commitment to putting the interests of our clients first and how the actions of these individuals fell short of what we expect of our employees,\" the memo said.</p><p>All three were key executives on both the firm's secondary funds and their departures have triggered clauses in investor agreements, which identify people whom fund investors consider critical for investments or operations. When such a clause is triggered, investment periods can be suspended and investors can choose to liquidate the fund.</p><p>According to the people, the firm has held conversations with investors and this week planned to ask the debut secondary fund's limited-partner advisory committee to let the firm resume investing from it. But further fundraising efforts for the strategy could be very challenging for the firm, the people said.</p><p>BlackRock's management has been busy reorganizing the remaining SLS staff of 10 investment professionals, the people said. The firm has emphasized that the SLS team is resilient and has relationships to ensure that BlackRock can still get access to the best secondary deals available, the people said.</p><p>BlackRock has named Lynn Baranski, the global head of investments of its private-equity partners group, to lead the SLS fund, according to the internal memo. She will also chair the SLS investment committee, where she is already a member.</p><p>According to two sources, BlackRock has also elevated Directors Jarid Colucci and Derek Krouner to the SLS investment committee.</p><p>This is the second time BlackRock's ambitions for expanding its private-equity business have suffered setbacks.</p><p>In 2019, Mark Wiseman was ousted from the firm for violating company policies on engaging in personal relationships with other BlackRock employees, The Wall Street Journal reported. Mr. Wiseman had joined BlackRock in 2016 from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and directed strategy on private-equity and other alternative investments.</p><p>The firm's longer duration private-equity fund, launched in 2019 as BlackRock Long Term Private Capital SCSp, had an initial target of $12 billion but struggled to attract investors, WSJ reported. The fund closed its initial offering period in January 2021 with $3.44 billion, according to a statement from the firm.</p><p>Messrs. Lessar and Tam joined BlackRock in 2018 and were previously managing directors at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Ms. Isaac was a partner at Jasper Ridge Partners and a principal at Pantheon Ventures before she joined BlackRock in 2019.</p><p>Apollo is among the asset managers setting up secondary investing operations. The firm aims to make investments in transactions led by fund general partners, in which firms seek to recapitalize one or more companies from an older fund or multiple older funds through a new investment vehicle to extend their ownership and add fresh capital.</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com</p><p>Key Executive Departures Disrupt BlackRock's Secondary Fundraising</p>",
