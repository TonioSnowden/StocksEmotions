  "text": "<p>Yoshiyuki Murata's first task when he started work at the Japanese developer Mori Building, in 1988, was to start knocking on doors in the central Tokyo district of Azabudai.</p> <p>It was a traditional, residential area of tightly-packed, low-rise buildings strung along a narrow road. Murata's job was to persuade the occupants — young and old — to consider joining forces with Mori to redevelop the land.</p> <p>“There were around 220 houses, mainly wood, and approximately 330 residents or owners with an interest in the land,” he says.</p> <p>Thirty-four years later, Murata is a real estate veteran who, in April, had the satisfaction of watching the first of three towers Mori is building in Azabudai reach its maximum height of 330m. It is Japan's tallest building.</p> <p>The sprawling Toranomon-Azabudai project symbolises a breed of large-scale redevelopment that is reshaping the capital on a vast scale and providing a tempting urban model for other fast-growing metropolises in Asia.</p> <p>Mori Building's mastery of these colossal rebuilds — and the ultra-luxurious islands it plants in place of traditional neighbourhoods — has made it the most admired and controversial developer in Japan.</p> <p>“Mori Building was a kind of pioneer for redeveloping the city centre with large-scale projects,” says Hiroo Ichikawa, a professor of urban planning at Meiji University and adviser to the company. “In Tokyo, these developments are now ongoing everywhere.”</p> <p>While London has Canary Wharf and New York has Hudson Yards, Tokyo has five or six areas where a single company is redeveloping a huge plot, transforming the higgledy-piggledy, unplanned urbanism. Most of those sites rely on long-term landholdings or derelict industrial sites but, uniquely, Mori Building is also able to do this with established residential neighbourhoods.</p> <p>Its approach is to persuade existing residents to form a redevelopment association, explains Murata. After an appraisal of their land, the company offers them a menu of options for a new apartment or shop in the rebuilt project. Alternatively, the company will offer to buy their land and rehouse them elsewhere.</p> <p>About 90 per cent of the current landowners will return to live in the new Toranomon-Azabudai project, says Murata, although some others were bought out during the many years of negotiations. Japanese law allows the compulsory purchase of land from final holdouts should a small number refuse to co-operate.</p> <p>Mori Building's most famous redevelopment, which became the model copied across the city, is Roppongi Hills. Completed in 2003, it pooled 400 smaller plots into an extensive site with a cinema, an art gallery, large amounts of luxury retail, a Grand Hyatt hotel, two residential towers, and a 54-storey main tower that became the Japan headquarters for Google and Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>As an unlisted, private company, Mori Building's secret weapon is patience. “Assembling the land for Roppongi Hills took more than 17 years,” says Ichikawa. “If you're a CEO, you need success in a short time. This kind of large-scale development doesn't fit a normal business person.”</p> <p>Urban planners and critics look at Mori Building's creations with a mixture of admiration for their high quality and frustration at their overall impact on the city. “What they create is a small version of the radiant city of Le Corbusier,” says Norihiko Dan, an architect and lecturer. “Le Corbusier tried to make everywhere like a park.”</p> <p>The founder of Mori Building, Minoru Mori, often cited Le Corbusier as an inspiration. In the Swiss-French architect's vision, the creation of high-rise “urban villages” would make it possible to open up large amounts of green space around the towers' base.</p> <p>Mori Building makes a big play of the green space — the Toranomon-Azabudai project will include 2.4 hectares of greenery on an 8.1 hectare site — but the parkland is dwarfed by the scale of the buildings. Overall, the project will create 861,500 sq m of floor space and 1,400 residential units, a huge densification.</p> <p>Ryotaro Iwami, a professor of urban engineering at Saitama University, says this comes at the expense of existing communities: “From the design perspective, Mori Building projects may be amazing, but from the perspective of residents it looks different.”</p> <p>In reality, Iwami argues, relatively few residents get rehoused in a new Mori project, with tenants forced to leave or owners having to sell out because the drawn-out redevelopment process leads to business closures and blights the land.</p> <p>Another issue, says Dan, is the way mega-projects interact with the city. “These developments try to enclose a certain area — they're not intending to connect to the adjacent area,” he says. The luxurious shops in Roppongi Hills draw people to the development, he says, but they do little for local people or the neighbouring shopping street.</p> <p>For Tokyo, however, this ability to renew itself is a significant competitive advantage. Whereas cities in Europe are limited by their historic fabric, and face insurmountable public opposition to demolishing even mundane buildings, Tokyo is able to rebuild entire neighbourhoods, providing a strong supply of top-quality office space and new homes.</p> <p>Changes to planning law during the time of former prime minister Shinzo Abe have made big redevelopments even easier. Other examples include a large project by the JR East rail company around a new maglev (magnetic levitation) station in the Shinagawa district.</p> <p>For sheer scale and prestige, though, Mori Building remains the one to beat.</p> <p>When the Toranomon-Azabudai project is finished next year, it will bookend Murata's career. “We don't just want to build a building,” he said. “We want to create a town.</p><p>Source: Robin Harding 2022 'Radical neighbourhood redevelopment model splits opinion in Tokyo' FT.com 27 June.
