  "text": "<p>* S&amp;P 500 SPX climbed 14 basis points, or 0.4%, to 3,994.</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 115 points, or 0.4%, to 31,699.</p><p>* Nasdaq Composite COMP advanced 47 points, or 0.4%, to 11,839.</p><p>U.S. stocks snapped a lengthy losing streak on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rising 436 points, or 1.4%, to 31581, the S&amp;P 500 SPX advancing 72 points, or 1.83%, to 3980, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP gaining 247 points, or 2.14%, to 11792. For the Nasdaq, the 7-day losing streak was its longest since 2016.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Investors received a brief reprieve on Wednesday as stocks saw their biggest daily gains in a month, supported by a pullback in Treasury yields and declining inflation expectations.</p><p>But on Thursday, markets turned volatile once again as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell echoed his hawkish comments from Jackson Hole, while the European Central Bank hiked interest rates by 75 basis points, and signaled that more jumbo-sized rate hikes would likely follow.</p><p>During a discussion sponsored by the Cato Institute on Thursday morning, Powell said the Fed remained committed to the fight against inflation, and wouldn't be deterred by politics or other distractions.</p><p>\"I can also assure you that we never take into consideration external political considerations,\" Powell said, during a moderated discussion at a Cato Institute monetary conference.</p><p>Powell's comments followed similarly hawkish remarks from Fed Vice-Chair Lael Brainard, who said Wednesday that higher interest rates would be necessary \"for some time,\" as well as a Wall Street Journal report hinting at another 75 basis point rate hike from the Fed at its meeting later this month.</p><p>Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Investment Management, said Powell's speech wasn't anything new, and that investors are more focused on next week's inflation print.</p><p>\"The comments from Powell are nothing groundbreaking. There was nothing really new. He continued to stress the importance of tightening policy to fight inflation,\" Goldman said.</p><p>Goldman added that markets will likely remain volatile until next week's consumer-price index for August is released. It's due out Tuesday.</p><p>Stocks also grappled with higher Treasury yields and a stronger dollar as the 2-year yield rose 1.8 basis points to 3.489%, while the 10-year yield was flat at 3.270%. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.1%, reclaiming the 110 level.</p><p>Crude oil prices were also rising on Thursday after falling to their lowest levels since Russia invaded Ukraine one day earlier. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery CLV22was up $1.50, or 1.8%, to $83.44 a barrel.</p><p>If stocks finish higher on Thursday, it will mark their first back-to-back gains in nearly two weeks. BTIG's Jonathan Krinsky said he wouldn't be surprised to see stocks climb Thursday since their more than week-long losing streak had left them in oversold territory.</p><p>\"The market is short-term oversold but everyone knows it,\" Krinsky said in emailed comments.</p><p>Back in Europe, the euro rallied briefly after the ECB rate hike, before turning back lower as focus shifted back toward expectations for another 75 basis point hike from the Federal Reserve in September.</p><p>The pound GBPUSD also declined against the dollar following the ECB hike and U.K. Prime Minister Liz Truss unveiling details of a Â£150 billion ($173 billion) supportpackage for households and business struggling with surging power prices.</p><p>On the U.S. economic data front, weekly jobless claims data showed layoffs in the U.S. remained near record lows as the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell to its lowest level in three-and-a-half months.</p><p>Hear from Carl Icahn at the Best New Ideas in Money Festival on Sept. 21 and Sept. 22 in New York. The legendary trader will reveal his view on this year's wild market ride.</p><p>U.S. stocks turn higher, head for first back-to-back gains in two weeks</p>",
