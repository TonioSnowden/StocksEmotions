  "title": "Earnings expectations for 2023 likely to be revised lower, Goldman warns",
  "text": "<p>While the impact on earnings would deviate dramatically from sector to sector, Kostin and his team projected that year-ahead earnings expectations for S&amp;P 500 companies would likely contract by as much as 11%, compared with the 9% annualized growth currently penciled in by Goldman analysts. Consumer discretionary companies will likely see the biggest downward revision among the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors.</p><p>Industrials and materials stocks would also likely see a large rejiggering of expectations, while utilities, healthcare and energy stocks are expected to be the most resilient, with EPS expectations contracting by just a percentage point, or two, as in the case of energy stocks.</p><p>While Goldman Sachs' house view puts the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession by year's end at just 30%, the massive impact that a significant economic contraction might have on stocks bears further examination. According to Kostin, the S&amp;P 500 could finish the year at 3,150 if this scenario materializes. That's more than 1,000 points lower than Goldman's current year-end forecast, which sees the S&amp;P 500 finishing the year at around 4,300.</p><p>Some of Goldman's rivals, including Bank of America BAC and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM and Deutsche Bank DB, all see higher odds of a recession arriving before year's end.</p><p>If this scenario came to pass, it would constitute a 15.9% drop from the 3,749 level, which is where the S&amp;P 500 was trading on Thursday afternoon. This view isn't anything new, however: Kostin first published this warning more than a month ago, shortly before stocks tumbled to their lowest levels of the year.</p><p>U.S. stocks traded lower on Thursday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA off 600 points early in the session before recovering slightly into the afternoon. The blue-chip average was down 365 points, or 1.2%, at 30,413 in mid-afternoon trading. The S&amp;P 500 SPXwas down 39 points, or 1.1%, at 3,762. The Nasdaq Composite COMPwas down 31 points, or 0.8%, at 11,161.</p><p>Earnings expectations for 2023 likely to be revised lower, Goldman warns</p>",
