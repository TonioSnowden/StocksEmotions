  "title": "Putin Says Russia to Meet Gas Commitments to Europe but Warns of Nord Stream Cuts; Russia's president says sanctions could prevent additional maintenance on components for the pipeline carrying Russian gas to Europe",
  "text": "<p>The European Union, meanwhile, braced itself for life without ample supplies of Russian gas, rolling out guidelines for rationing the fuel across the bloc. Nord Stream, the main artery for Russian gas to Europe, is currently down due to regular maintenance and European governments are worried the Kremlin won't restore its flow when the work ends Thursday. A prolonged outage could prompt governments to ration energy, hurting industry and hitting already fragile economic growth.</p><p>In comments late Tuesday after his visit to Tehran, Mr. Putin said that Kremlin-controlled energy exporter Gazprom PJSC, the pipeline's majority shareholder, \"has always fulfilled and will fulfill all of its obligations.\"</p><p>But the Russian president added that flows might fall to some 20% of capacity as soon as next week if a pipeline turbine that was undergoing repairs in Canada isn't returned to Russia soon. Mr. Putin said that another turbine had to go for maintenance on July 26.</p><p>Taken together, Mr. Putin's remarks are consistent with a Kremlin approach that keeps European governments off balance as Russia manipulates gas flows. Keeping the pipeline open but varying supplies sustains Moscow's leverage in its economic battle with the West. It also maintains high gas prices, hitting European economies while bolstering Russian revenues that can help fund its war in Ukraine.</p><p>The tactic carries risks for Russia, however, further damaging its reputation as a reliable gas supplier and encouraging European economies to aggressively seek other sources of energy. Due to limited pipeline infrastructure to Asia, Russia isn't able to quickly reroute much of the Europe-bound gas. Shutting off the gas completely, meanwhile, would burn a decadeslong relationship with a lucrative customer, leading to economic repercussions for years to come.</p><p>\"I think we should be very clear. Gazprom has proven to be a completely unreliable supplier,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday. \"And behind Gazprom is, as we know, Putin. So it is not predictable what is going to happen.\"</p><p>Even before the maintenance began, Gazprom last month cut deliveries on the pipeline to 40% of its capacity, blaming Canadian sanctions against Russia that had initially prevented the return of the turbine being repaired there. European officials have dismissed the turbine explanation as a pretext for Moscow to try to wreak economic havoc on the continent and retaliate for Western sanctions on Russia.</p><p>Germany has been racing to return the turbine to Russia after Canada earlier this month exempted the component from its sanctions.</p><p>Gazprom on Wednesday said it still hadn't received documentation for the turbine from Siemens Energy AG, which is handling the maintenance. Gazprom said the need for maintenance on the turbine and other equipment has had a direct impact on the safe operations of Nord Stream.</p><p>Siemens Energy said in a statement that its goal was always to transport the turbine to its place of operation as quickly as possible. The company said it was also ready to maintain further turbines.</p><p>On Wednesday, Russia's state newswire TASS quoted Mr. Putin questioning the quality of the refurbished turbine, which is en route back to Russia. \"Now they are saying that they will return the turbine. But in what capacity will they return it?\" Mr. Putin was quoted as saying.</p><p>Siemens Energy said it maintains turbines with high-quality standards.</p><p>The EU released a plan Wednesday that urges governments to step up their energy-conservation campaigns. The commission's plan calls for EU countries to voluntarily curb their gas consumption by 15% over the next eight months and set priorities to determine which industrial sectors would be most affected.</p><p>While some European officials have in recent days cast doubt on whether Nord Stream would come back online Thursday, Mr. Putin's comments helped fuel expectations the pipeline would restart.</p><p>On Wednesday, the German company that operates infrastructure for gas arriving in Germany from Nord Stream said it had received orders for Thursday. The chief of Germany's federal energy regulator confirmed that gas was booked for Thursday, though he said last-minute changes were still possible.</p><p>Flows of gas through the pipeline spiked several times on Tuesday, which the pipeline operator said was a technically required step in the maintenance process.</p><p>The operator said Wednesday that so far there were no changes in the planned maintenance schedule.</p><p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs said they expect the pipeline to come back online Thursday at its premaintenance capacity of 40%.</p><p>A full stop \"would remove flexibility from Russia's supply decisions, once you're at zero, there's only one place to go: up,\" the bank wrote in a note to clients Tuesday, adding that such a scenario would also deprive Russia of gas revenues.</p><p>But Mr. Putin's new warning that the flows could be curbed to 20% next week shows that Moscow will continue to use gas to squeeze Europe, even if it doesn't completely cut it off, analysts say.</p><p>\"It's absolutely clear that Moscow is cutting supplies for geopolitical reasonsâ€”it wants to create a European gas crisis this winter to bring Europe to its knees to the point where it cuts support to Ukraine and forces Kyiv to concede to Moscow's demands,\" said Timothy Ash, senior strategist for BlueBay Asset Management LLP in London.</p><p>Mr. Putin also warned the West that its plan to cap the prices of Russian oil would rock global markets and push prices up.</p><p>\"Now we are hearing all sorts of crazy ideas about limiting the volume of Russian oil and capping the Russian oil price,\" Mr. Putin said. \"Oil prices will skyrocket.\"</p><p>Write to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com</p><p>Putin Says Russia to Meet Gas Commitments to Europe but Warns of Nord Stream Cuts</p>",
