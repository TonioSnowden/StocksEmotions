  "text": "<p>The pound GBPUSD rose 0.2% to $1.3658, while the yield on the 10-year gilt BX:TMBMKGB-10Y slipped 1 basis point to 1.512%. But the two-year gilt BX:TMBMKGB-02Y surged to 1.38%, the highest level ince 2011.</p><p>Global yields remained elevated a day after U.S. consumer inflation came in a higher-than-expected 7.5% for January, a 40-year high. That has firmed up the case for not only a Federal Reserve interest rate hike in March, but some Wall Street banks are now calling for numerous U.S. hikes this year, such as seven from Goldman Sachs.</p><p>Read: Inflation's on fire, and the Fed's poised to act. Here's how markets and the economy have reacted to the first hike in a cycle.</p><p>In the U.K., meanwhile, where two interest rate increases have already been pushed through by the Bank of England recently, data showed economic growth expanded by a stronger-than-expected 7.5% in 2021, rebounding from a 9.4% plunge at the height of the pandemic.</p><p>“In December Britain's economy contracted by 0.2% month-on-month to equal its pre-COVID level from February 2020.

Shares of the heavyweight rose 0.7%.</p><p>Weighing on the FTSE 100 was weakness for banks, with Barclays UK:BARCBCS down 3% and NatWest NWG off over 1%.
