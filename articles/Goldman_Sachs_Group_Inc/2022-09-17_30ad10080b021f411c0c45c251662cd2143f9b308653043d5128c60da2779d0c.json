  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Friday's Markets:  Stocks End  Week Down  On Profit,  Rate Fears  ----  By Corrie Driebusch and Caitlin Ostroff",
  "text": "<p>   U.S. stocks closed lower Friday as investors came to grips with corporate warnings that paint an increasingly dire outlook for the health of the U.S. economy. </p><p>   In the past week, companies including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. prepared to cut jobs, exacerbating fears of an impending recession. FedEx cautioned late Thursday that it is closing offices to offset declining demand, and General Electric said supply-chain problems were weighing on profits. </p><p>   The news pushed down stocks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 139.40 points, or 0.5%, to 30822.42. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 28.02 points, or 0.7%, to 3873.33. </p><p>   For the week, the Dow lost 4.1%, while the S&amp;P retreated 4.8% </p><p>   The Nasdaq Composite declined 103.95 points, or 0.9%, to 11448.40. It fell 5.5% for the week, its worst since June. All three indexes are down four of the past five weeks. </p><p>   The big moves are surprising given how U.S. stocks appeared on the upswing earlier this summer, climbing from their mid-June lows on the back of earnings that weren't as bad as feared and some strong hiring data. However, investors who had hoped that the midsummer bounce back was the beginning of a new bull market rally got a rude awakening when data on Tuesday confirmed that inflation remains stubbornly high. </p><p>   Investors now anticipate that the Fed will have to keep raising rates aggressively, which could eventually tip the economy into recession. Futures bets show that traders see a 76% probability that the Fed will raise interest rates by another 0.75 percentage point at its meeting this coming week, according to CME Group. Investors are also pricing in another rate rise of the same amount in November. </p><p>   The two-year Treasury yield is especially sensitive to investors' expectations for near-term Fed rate increases. It settled Friday at 3.859%, its second-highest level of the year. On Thursday, it settled at its highest level since 2007. </p><p>   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note also fell slightly, to 3.447%. Yields and prices move inversely. </p><p>   Before Tuesday's inflation data, some money managers had hoped central banks would be in a position to start toning down their rate increases. </p><p>   \"It's clear that they're not going to pivot. That ship has sailed,\" said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. </p><p>   Traders are also nervous the Fed may continue tightening even if the economy slows. </p><p>   FedEx, a bellwether for the larger economy, said Thursday that its quarterly revenue fell below its expectations. It also said it was closing offices and parking aircraft to offset declining volumes of packages moving around the world. Shares dropped $43.85, or 21%, to $161.02 Friday. </p><p>   That marked its largest percent decrease on record, according to Dow Jones Market Data. </p><p></p>",
