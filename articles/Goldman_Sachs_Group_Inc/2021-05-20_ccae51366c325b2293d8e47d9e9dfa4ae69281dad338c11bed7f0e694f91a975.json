Existing shareholders in the company separately sold $335m in shares as part of the offering.</p> <p>Investors are wondering how Petersson, by some interpretations the antithesis of a corporate chieftain (“sometimes you have to give up profitability, to do good,” he once told <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>) will fare beneath the microscope.</p> <p>“You have a lot more watchful eyes from the analyst community and investors. A lot of us [analysts] are thinking short-term, looking at sales figures and margins,” said <strong>CFRA</strong> analyst <strong>Arun Sundaram</strong>.</p> <p>Petersson has already managed some firefighting while the company has been in private hands.&#xa0;</p> <p>When consumers demanded answers about Oatly's connection to Blackstone and its Trump-supporting chief executive <strong>Stephen Schwarzman</strong>, the brand <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OatlyUK/status/1300840791611408384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1300840791611408384%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fen%2Farticle%2Fv7gnwd%2Foatly-milk-blackstone-controversy-explained\">defended itself</a> on Twitter saying: “All in all, it's about moving the world's capital towards green investment.”</p> <p>One thing to note: Oatly's majority stakeholder, a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37280e16-47e7-4dc3-89f7-3e97a36de89c\">joint venture</a> between the Chinese state-owned conglomerate <strong>China Resources</strong> and the Belgian family investment group <strong>Verlinvest</strong>, will cut its 55.9 per cent stake but will retain “significant influence” according to the IPO <a href=\"https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-21-156926/d123209df1a.htm?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=18e85464a6cb9a19ba936826d485b14e6bfd01c6-1620973523-0-ATBZjKKCBHQ5VvLojNl0cD2nA5iMk9xHfF-MLmupNy-MqEsgkBu98AwglpM-3Bbzho3gBT1ufvCvlSq3WF1YoBJwtqpVqwQCFg7NE_aVEjPjtIXnzLG59rHNkcqirdgCmNx0cr-kb3rMAplf9yvbY1H2LVw-OheEbMWwtnwSLL4ERD8affx9ZNmOk4Ifs_2hkDCKLvt9oe0tgLqCSGYatmXHZIGM-NrOI31HJ_3HCC9VWEqInAWa_9YSM7j5Gg52TTkWPEfT4cTn7ciVRWc9njc85SBiy6FVZITyoV9CDaqvjeDbxlpJXwORaJzv4OaHP4L-9oBYqyvWKHi-JnBbddFWlA5smUkoDtoZM0V18CDth68UmcPvIdW0VOVZLHFmigV0edebpfnOSfm83aCkjHIqt_0fi_xKt4rlNAOfGcZPaFibSHW6PlKEcGe6zuDfDRcoDFrM9XUPVm6URpYfeJPA2UIspN9xumGJoGjDJdAlh4yf0hlCfQozrP6f4U4IC4Pl0jtfxtp1oNf_Ml0gDME#rom123209_16\">filing</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>That backing could cause complications if the US government makes it hard for the group to share information with a state-owned company. (This is one of the reasons Oatly has said it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37280e16-47e7-4dc3-89f7-3e97a36de89c\">may </a>add a listing in Hong Kong.)</p> <p>Dig deeper into the company and its charismatic boss — who dabbled in beer distribution, handmade crockery and running a nightclub before turning to the Oatly gig — with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e37d6985-5c48-46f4-8b02-a67c1a6dfd01\">this article</a> by the FT's Emiko Terazono and Judith Evans.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Inside the investment firm founded by the son of a top Chinese official&#xa0;</h2> <p>When it comes to finance, <strong>Liu He </strong>is Chinese president <strong>Xi Jinping</strong>'s right-hand man.&#xa0;</p> <p>As vice-premier in charge of the financial sector of the world's second-largest economy, he is at the very top of the Chinese Communist party.</p> <p>And as head of the Chinese government's Financial Stability and Development Committee, Liu is one of the principal officials overseeing Xi's crackdown on <strong>Alibaba</strong> and <strong>Ant Group</strong> (more on that in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56ccce4f-abac-4935-a3f4-22c71020ba0f\">this DD post</a> from last month).</p> <p>His son<strong> Liu Tianran</strong>, who also uses the English name <strong>Andy</strong>, is the founder of <strong>Tianyi Ziteng Asset Management</strong>, also known as <strong>Skycus Capital </strong>— the subject of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62554721-3b52-4cb9-8d1d-ccdf40b4e463\">this FT investigation</a> by Tom Mitchell, Tabby Kinder and Demetri Sevastopulo.</p> <p>As his father rose through the ranks, Andy Liu stepped back from Skycus, standing down as chair of the investment group before his father joined the Chinese Communist party's 25-member politburo. He transferred his Skycus shares to another executive shortly after the elder Liu took the vice-premier job in March 2018.</p> <p>Yet several people close to Skycus's operations told the FT that Andy Liu continued to work on deals for the firm and played a central role in lucrative transactions involving <strong>Tencent</strong> and <strong>JD.com</strong> units.</p> <p>The tale of Skycus is likely to raise an eyebrow among those who watch China closely.</p> <p>It has made successful bets linked to Tencent and JD.com, including a 2019 investment of $40m in JD.com's healthcare spin-off that's worth almost $230m today, and a $5m 2018 investment in <strong>Tencent Music </strong>that's now estimated to be worth almost double that.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Communist party has set its sights on Tencent rival Alibaba and its founder<strong> Jack Ma</strong>. That scrutiny reached a climax in November, when Chinese regulators effectively blocked the $37bn IPO of Ma's Ant Group.</p> <p>While JD.com and at least one unit of Tencent, Ant's largest online payments competitor, have also found themselves targeted by the clampdown, it seems to have hit Ma's companies hardest, based on share prices. &#xa0;</p> <h2>Two of Europe's biggest banking names face off in court</h2> <p>Though <strong>Andrea Orcel </strong>and <strong>Ana Botín</strong> sat only four seats away from each other in a Madrid courtroom on Wednesday, the former friends' recollections of the events that led them there were miles apart.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57b5f311-8cd2-4018-a50e-1198944eb743\">Orcel</a>, a former <strong>UBS</strong> executive and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/517a0311-23d6-4bfb-8174-f3adc480f48b\">newly-minted chief</a> of Italy's <strong>UniCredit</strong>, and Botín, executive chair of Spain's <strong>Santander</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a792bc2-2afb-11e9-a5ab-ff8ef2b976c7\">have been sparring</a> for more than two years after a falling out with the Spanish bank left Orcel unemployed for the first time in decades.</p> <p>Orcel, a longtime adviser to Santander while at UBS, is claiming tens of millions of euros in compensation from the Spanish lender for reversing its plans to hire him in 2019.</p> <p>Botín, on the other hand, says the offer letter issued to Orcel back when he was being courted for Santander's top job didn't constitute a contract.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Santander boss greeted Orcel upon her arrival just before the hearing began, to which he did not audibly reply, the FT's Daniel Dombey tells DD in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb8bb908-5a0f-430c-bb8c-3b17dfd2db59\">dispatch from Madrid.</a></p> <p>Orcel, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5bade621-caa8-4a95-92bc-0cd7cbba55cf\">halved</a> his €112m claim for compensation from Santander the night before the hearing, wasn't asked to testify. Though his lawyers did question Botín intensively throughout her 90 minutes of testimony, Daniel tells us.</p> <p>But the hearing was abruptly cut short before any decisions could be made. Two key players in the case, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb0f4ac1-eced-4371-a298-42c0cc1424af\">UBS chair</a> <strong>Axel Weber</strong> and the Swiss bank's head of performance and reward <strong>Mark Shelton</strong>, didn't show up to court despite being summoned, citing the pandemic. UBS said they had offered to appear via video.</p> <p>“These people travel a lot,” judge <strong>Javier Sánchez Beltrán</strong> countered, before rescheduling.</p> <p>Stay tuned for the next episode.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> has hired <strong>Daniel Ross</strong> as its new head of investment banking coverage in the UK and Ireland. He joins in London from <strong>Barclays</strong>, where he was vice-chair of UK investment banking and global head of media.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Citibank</strong> is promoting its global head of trade <strong>Ebru Pakcan</strong> to the new head of EMEA emerging markets, replacing <strong>Atiq Rehman</strong>, who will retire after a 37-year career at the lender.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis </strong>has recruited <strong>Peter Abbott </strong>as a tax partner in its London office. He joins from <strong>Macfarlanes</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>The Silicon Valley law firm<strong> Cooley</strong> is setting up a new office in Chicago, which will include <a href=\"https://www.cooley.com/news/coverage/2021/2021-05-17-cooley-launches-chicago-office\">nine new partners</a> from<strong> DLA Piper</strong>, <strong>Latham &amp; Watkins </strong>and <strong>Winston &amp; Strawn</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Perella Weinberg Partners</strong> has hired <strong>Christian Bradeen</strong> as a partner in New York. He joins from <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>, where he was a managing director advising clients in the chemicals and speciality materials sectors.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Weil Gotshal</strong> has recruited <strong>Jenine Hulsmann</strong> as a partner in London to lead the expansion of its European antitrust and competition practice. She is currently a partner at the law firm <strong>Clifford Chance</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads&#xa0;&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Back to basics </strong>AT&amp;T wasn't the first of its kind to chase Hollywood dreams. But US telecoms groups are realising that focusing on pipes may not be such a bad idea, as they unwind big bets on entertainment to concentrate on their 5G capabilities.
