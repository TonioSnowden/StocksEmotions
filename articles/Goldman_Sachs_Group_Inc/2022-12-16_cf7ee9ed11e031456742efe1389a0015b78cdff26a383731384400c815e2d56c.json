  "title": "Business News: Lanvin Slips on NYSE Debut --- Trading comes after luxury fashion retailer merged with SPAC backed by Chinese firm",
  "text": "<p>The shares traded above $14 in mid-morning trading before ending the day at $7.63.</p><p>Primavera's SPAC, called Primavera Capital Acquisition Corp., raised $414 million in January 2021 at the height of the blank-check company boom. It said at the time that it wanted to merge with a global consumer company that had \"a significant China presence or a compelling China potential.\"</p><p>SPACs are publicly listed shell companies with ready pools of cash to invest in -- and merge with -- private businesses. If a SPAC fails to find a merger target by a deadline, typically two years, investors can take their money back. SPAC shareholders also can choose to redeem their shares upon a merger.</p><p>Lanvin Group and Primavera, founded by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Greater China chairman Fred Hu, announced the merger in March. The deal has faced multiple hurdles including a stock-market rout, currency-market volatility and investors' waning interest in de-SPACs, a term used to describe SPACs' eventual acquisitions of operating businesses.</p><p>In October, Lanvin lowered its valuation from $1.25 billion to $1 billion, the same amount at which it was valued after a private fundraising round last year. The company blamed the reduced valuation on foreign-exchange fluctuations and the declining valuations of its bigger rivals such as LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE and Kering.</p><p>Lanvin owns five brands that were acquired by Fosun, a Shanghai-based conglomerate co-founded by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang. Fosun was once known as one of the most deal-hungry Chinese companies, making a spate of acquisitions before Beijing cracked down on outbound investments a few years ago.</p><p>The flagship in the portfolio is fashion house Lanvin, which was founded in 1889. Others under the group include Wolford, a high-end Austrian women's hosiery brand, Italian shoemaker Sergio Rossi, American luxury house St. John and tailoring label Caruso.</p><p>Most fresh capital raised by the group was from outside institutional investors, including Japanese conglomerate Itochu Corp. Around 97% of the original SPAC shareholders redeemed their shares upon the merger, meaning they took back the cash invested in the shell company.</p><p>The average redemption rate for de-SPAC transactions has shot up to 84% this year from 45% last year, according to data from SPAC Research. A rate of 84% means that investors have redeemed $84 of every $100 they put in.</p><p>\"The biggest challenge has been getting investors to focus on a company's fundamentals in a market where SPACs have been labeled as something equal to failure,\" said Max Chen, a Primavera partner and a director of Lanvin Group.</p><p>The change in the market environment has made investors less willing to invest in SPACs, said Benjamin Kwasnick, founder of SPAC Research. \"SPACs have always been easier in a bull market and it's not surprising that investors are staying focused on yield rather than fundamental investment in new companies right now,\" he said.</p>",
