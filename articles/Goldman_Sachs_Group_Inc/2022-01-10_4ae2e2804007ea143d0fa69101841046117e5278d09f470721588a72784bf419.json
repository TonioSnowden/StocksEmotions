  "text": "<p>Top News</p><p>Purdue Pharma can appeal rejection of Sackler settlement plan. A federal judge authorized Purdue Pharma LP and its Sackler family owners to appeal a ruling that threw out their $4.5 billion settlement of thousands of lawsuits linked to the bankrupt company's OxyContin painkiller and its role in the opioid crisis. The Second Circuit can choose whether to accept Purdue's appeal, which aims to revive a chapter 11 plan to resolve an onslaught of lawsuits alleging that the company and its family owners contributed to opioid addiction.</p><p>Attorneys general from California, Connecticut and a handful of other states have held out, unsatisfied with the deal terms. Last month, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon struck down the chapter 11 plan, saying it went too far by releasing those states' claims against the Sacklers.</p><p>The judge acknowledged on Friday that allowing the appeal might change states' negotiating positions with Purdue, but said she didn't believe it would delay final resolution of the litigation. She said the states were objecting because they were \"flush with victory on their appeal and determined to use it to their negotiating advantage.\"</p><p>Restaurants seek federal aid as Omicron surge threatens another hard winter. Nearly two years into the pandemic, U.S. restaurants and bars are dealing with higher costs, accumulating debts and customers fearful of the latest virus variants, according to a letter signed by more than 3,300 operators. The restaurant operators said they were in danger of closing permanently if a federal fund adopted last year to assist the food-service industry isn't replenished soon.</p><p>\"In the outbreak of new variants, restaurants are the first ones to suffer.\"</p><p>— Sean Kennedy, vice president of the National Restaurant Association</p><p>Distress</p><p>Cyber firm Cyber Ninjas closes down amid debt and legal woes. Cyber Ninjas, the company hired to lead a Republican-ordered review of Maricopa County's 2020 election results, said it was shutting down, citing mounting legal costs and debt among other factors. Previously a little-known cybersecurity firm, Cyber Ninjas became a central figure in an unusual review of the 2020 presidential results after Democrat Joe Biden won in Arizona's most populous county.</p><p>The Cyber Ninjas' report ultimately confirmed Mr. Biden's win in Maricopa County, but the company has faced lawsuits over the election review. An Arizona judge ordered Cyber Ninjas to pay $50,000 a day if the company doesn't hand over public records related to the review, according to the Arizona Republic newspaper, which filed a lawsuit demanding the records.</p><p>Bankruptcy</p><p>Texas co-op's members object to J.P. Morgan hiring. The three largest member-owners of the largest power cooperative in Texas said that its proposed investment banker J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. needs to manage potential conflicts of interest before being officially retained. Member cooperatives of Brazos Electric Power Cooperative Inc. raised concerns about J.P. Morgan's proposed retention on Friday as securitization investment banker, tasked with structuring potential debt sales.</p><p>A debt sale could help cover the $1.9 billion electricity bill that tipped Brazos into chapter 11 last year. Its member cooperatives are skeptical, worried that taking on so much debt would hit vulnerable ratepayers. The largest member, Denton County Electric Cooperative Inc., said the selection of J.P. Morgan is problematic because affiliates of the bank have various interests in the bankruptcy case—as a lender, a litigation defendant and service provider. Those interests mean J.P. Morgan may not qualify as a disinterested adviser under bankruptcy law, the objection said. J.P. Morgan declined to comment. — Andrew Scurria</p><p>New York developer Goldman seeks voice in All Year bankrupty. Real estate developer Yoel Goldman said bondholders should make room for his views to be heard on the planned bankruptcy sale of his business, All Year Holdings Ltd. In papers filed Friday in New York bankruptcy court, Mr. Goldman said he supported a sale process for All Year's real-estate assets but that it should look \"markedly different\" from the pre-bankruptcy marketing initiated by the company and its bondholders.</p><p>Mr. Goldman owns All Year but relinquished control to outside professionals last year. He said Friday that bondholders have made clear they don't want him involved in the marketing of All Year's assets. Nonetheless, \"it is important that they welcome ideas and proposals from any party-in-interest, including Mr. Goldman, who is deeply familiar with these assets,\" he said. All Year has struggled to meet nearly $1.6 billion in debt obligations tied to the 1,648 residential and 69 commercial units it owns in the Bushwick, Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods in Brooklyn. — Andrew Scurria</p><p>International</p><p>Shimao, considered one of China's stronger developers, is faltering. A rout in the bonds and shares of Shimao Group Holdings Ltd. shows how fragile market confidence is toward Chinese property developers. Concerns about Shimao's financial health have built rapidly, and were partly fanned last week by news about missed payments on trust loans, a form of shadow financing in China that is popular with the country's property companies. A Shimao subsidiary on Friday sought to dispel some of those concerns, saying it hadn't defaulted on any public-market debts, although it was facing some liquidity pressure. The unit vowed to drum up sales, collect receivables, dispose of assets, and communicate better with investors.</p><p>In Other News</p><p>Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc.'s sports network unit is close to clinching deals to carry National Basketball Association games on its new streaming service and $600 million of financing to support the launch later this year.
