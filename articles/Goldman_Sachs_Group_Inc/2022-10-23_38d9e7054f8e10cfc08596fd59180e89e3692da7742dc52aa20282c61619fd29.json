  "title": "Boris Johnson Drops Out of Race for U.K. Prime Minister, Giving Rishi Sunak the Edge; Former treasury chief could win contest as soon as Monday after large portion of Tory lawmakers said they wouldn't back Mr. Johnson's return to power",
  "text": "<p>The decision by Mr. Johnson—forced to step down as prime minister and party leader over the summer after a series of scandals—leaves Mr. Sunak as the heavy favorite to replace Liz Truss in the top job. Ms. Truss, who took office Sept. 6, said last week she was quitting after her economic program imploded, making her the shortest serving prime minister in British history. The only other remaining candidate is Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons.</p><p>The contest could be over by Monday afternoon, when candidates need to secure at least 100 nominations from fellow Tory lawmakers to stand as leader of the party. On Sunday Mr. Sunak had at least 128 public backers, while Ms. Mordaunt had around 23 supporters out of 357 Tory lawmakers, according to the British Broadcasting Corp.</p><p>It is unclear, however, how many of Mr. Johnson's backers will now throw their support behind Ms. Mordaunt, a former defense minister. If Ms. Mordaunt does clear the nomination threshold by the Monday afternoon deadline, then the Conservative Party's 170,000 members would pick a winner by Friday, and analysts say either candidate could win.</p><p>Mr. Johnson, who was forced out as prime minister following a mutiny in the Tory party, wanted to stage a dramatic comeback less than two months after leaving power, once Ms. Truss's premiership collapsed. Ms. Truss resigned while Mr. Johnson was on vacation in the Caribbean, prompting him to race back to the U.K. this weekend to drum up support.</p><p>Following two days of frantic horse trading, Mr. Johnson declared Sunday that he had gained enough support from Conservative lawmakers to run in the contest against Mr. Sunak but that continuing in the race \"would simply not be the right thing to do\" given that a large chunk of the party's lawmakers weren't backing him.</p><p>Mr. Johnson, who is a deeply controversial figure in the party, added that \"you can't govern effectively unless you have a united party in parliament.\" He said 102 Tory lawmakers backed him, a number that couldn't be independently verified.</p><p>Mr. Sunak's launch as candidate on Sunday was deliberately low key. There was no video nor press conference, just a statement on Twitter. \"There will be integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level of the government,\" he wrote.</p><p>If Mr. Sunak wins, it would cap a meteoric political rise and make him Britain's first prime minister of Indian heritage. The 42-year-old former hedge-fund manager gained a reputation as a steady-handed pragmatist when he was chancellor of the exchequer, the equivalent of finance minister.</p><p>Over the summer, he called Ms. Truss's economic platform of leading an economic revival through slashing taxes \"fairy-tale economics\" that would risk destabilizing the country's public finances as well as a possible backlash from financial markets. His warnings would prove true just weeks later as Ms. Truss rolled out her program, which combined tax cuts with a big new energy subsidy program, and was dealt a humiliating setback when market turbulence forced her to retreat and eventually resign.</p><p>Mr. Sunak's tenure as chancellor, when he occasionally raised taxes to keep public finances in check, as well as his recent prescient warnings about Ms. Truss's plans have earned him a reputation within the party as someone who can stabilize the markets following the recent turmoil—and at a time when the country is wrestling with double-digit inflation and slowing economic growth. In officially announcing his candidacy, Mr. Sunak pledged to \"fix our economy, unite our party and deliver for our country.\"</p><p>The U.K. Treasury is expected to outline on Oct. 31 a package of public spending cuts and possible tax increases as it looks to steady public finances. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt endorsed Mr. Sunak shortly after Mr. Johnson dropped out of the race.</p><p>The possible return of Mr. Johnson caused alarm in some quarters of the Conservative Party, coming just months after 50 members of his government quit, questioning his integrity following a series of scandals. Still, a sizable chunk of the party pined for a return of the 58-year-old on account of his ability to win elections. The Conservative Party is polling at historic lows following Ms. Truss's botched program of tax cuts.</p><p>On Saturday evening, Mr. Johnson held discussions with Mr. Sunak but failed to strike a compromise that would see one of them pull out, James Dudderidge, a Conservative lawmaker who was helping marshal Mr. Johnson's campaign, said early Sunday. He added that Mr. Johnson was \"in it to win.\" However as the day went on, Mr. Sunak appeared to gain traction with several public endorsements from high-ranking Tories. Mr. Johnson's base of support on the party's euroskeptic right, meanwhile, began to fray.</p><p>PHOTOS: Who Will Be the U.K.'s Next Prime Minister After Liz Truss? From Boris Johnson to Rishi Sunak</p><p>Several Conservative lawmakers, many of whom quit in protest over Mr. Johnson's governing style just this summer, said they wouldn't accept him as their leader, raising the prospect that Mr. Johnson wouldn't be able to control the party even if he did return as prime minister. \"We are not a fan club, nor are we organizing a popularity contest,\" wrote Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch, as she backed Mr. Sunak. \"We are the strongest and longest-surviving political party in the world.\"</p><p>Mr. Johnson's sudden decision to pull out caught many of his backers off guard. \"Well that was unexpected,\" Mr. Dudderidge tweeted Sunday night. \"Off to bed!\"</p><p>While Mr. Sunak is the favorite, he still has to see off Ms. Mordaunt, who is popular with Conservative members. The 49-year-old former public-relations professional has campaigned as a neutral figure who can reunite the party's feuding factions. However, she has a much lower public profile than Mr. Sunak.</p><p>Critics say Mr. Sunak is too wealthy to appeal to working-class voters. Mr. Sunak's wife, Akshata Murty, is the daughter of an Indian billionaire businessman. Mr. Sunak is estimated to be the richest member of the House of Commons.</p><p>He has argued his rise to wealth embodies the Conservative Party's values of meritocracy. His grandparents, originally from India, emigrated in the 1960s. His mother ran a pharmacy in southern England and his father was a doctor.</p><p>Mr. Sunak attended an elite British private school and then went on to work for Goldman Sachs. It was while working on an M.B.A. at Stanford University that he met his future wife. After a stint with a hedge fund, he got into politics and was quickly identified within the party as a rising star. His early support of Brexit during the 2016 referendum further played in his favor, helping propel him through the Conservative ranks.</p><p>Now Mr. Sunak will have to win over Mr. Johnson's supporters.</p><p>The enmity between the two men runs deep. Mr. Johnson appointed Mr. Sunak as his chancellor of the exchequer in 2020, elevating him to one of the highest positions in the country.</p><p>On July 5, Mr. Sunak resigned from Mr. Johnson's cabinet, saying they had differing views on the economy. The departure triggered an avalanche of additional resignations which eventually forced Mr. Johnson from power. The former prime minister had been under fire for a series of scandals, including being fined for breaking Covid-19 lockdown rules by attending a party. A parliamentary committee is probing whether Mr. Johnson lied to parliament about parties being held at Downing Street during pandemic lockdowns. Mr. Johnson has denied he hosted parties, but the committee could suspend him from parliament for a number of days.</p><p>In the race to find his successor, Mr. Johnson privately backed Ms. Truss rather than Mr. Sunak, who was painted as a Tory traitor by many Conservative members for bringing down Mr. Johnson.</p><p>Write to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com</p><p>Boris Johnson Drops Out of Race for U.K. Prime Minister, Giving Rishi Sunak the Edge</p>",
