  "title": "Crude climbs to its highest prices since 2014 after Abu Dhabi oil facility attack",
  "text": "<p>“The fact that the Houthis are now capable of setting off explosives at the Abu Dhabi oil facilities must be raising blood pressure on the Nymex,” Michael Lynch, president at Strategic Energy &amp; Economic Research (SEER), told MarketWatch.</p><p>Iran-backed Houthi rebels from Yemen claimed responsibility for the attack on the oil facility in Abu Dhabi that killed three people on Monday and caused a fire at the capital of United Arab Emirates's international airport. The U.A.E. is the world's eighth largest oil producer, and instability in the Gulf can spark concerns of supply shortages.</p><p>“The damage to the UAE oil facilities in Abu Dhabi is not significant in itself, but it raises the question of even more supply disruptions in the region in 2022,” said Louise Dickson, senior oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy, in a Tuesday note.</p><p>“The attack raises the geopolitical risk in the region and may signal the Iran-U.S. nuclear deal is off the table for the foreseeable future,” she said. That would mean “Iranian oil barrels are off the market, boosting demand for similar grade crude originating elsewhere.”</p><p>Against that backdrop, West Texas Intermediate crude for February CLG22 delivery&#xa0;rose $1.12, or 1.3%, to $84.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, following a 6.2% gain last week, its fourth weekly rise in a row, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>March Brent crude&#xa0;BRN00BRNH22,&#xa0;the global benchmark, added 72 cents, or 0.8%, to trade at $87.20 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, after last week's 5.3% weekly advance.</p><p>Prices for both WTI and Brent crude are trading at their highest since October 2014, according to FactSet data.</p><p>All in all, “expectations that omicron's impact on demand will be moderate, combined with concerns about supply” are making oil traders bullish, said Lynch.</p><p>Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs rolled out higher oil price forecasts, setting a 2023 Brent spot target of $105 a barrel in 2023, with 2022 headed for $96 a barrel, it said.</p><p>“Robust fundamentals have reversed last year's oil price meltdown, with the market remaining in a surprisingly large deficit as the Omicron demand hit is so far smaller (and likely briefer) than that of Delta exc. China,” said a team of commodity analysts led by Damien Courvalin, in a note dated Monday.</p><p>And while a hit to Chinese demand may be big due to the impact on its economy from its zero-COVID policy — Goldman estimates a 500,000 barrel per day hit in the first half of 2022 — the bank sees that offset by strong demand in the final quarter of this year, gas-to-oil substitution and “supply disappointments.”</p><p>“Net, we expect inventory draws to narrow but persist through 1Q22, with the global surplus in 2Q22 smaller than seasonal at 0.4 mb/d [400,000 barrels per day]”, said Courvalin and the team.</p><p>And by summer, OECD oil inventories will be at their lowest since 2000, along with a historic drop in spare capacity from oil cartel OPEC and its partners. “At $85/bbl, the market would remain at such critical levels, with insufficient buffers relative to demand and supply volatilities, through 2023,” he said.</p><p>Goldman's call is certainly helping oil but also, “their argument that some OPEC+ members, notably Angola and Nigeria, won't meet their quotas, leaving markets tighter for longer, is gaining a lot of credibility,” SEER's Lynch said.</p><p>Oil remained higher after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, in its monthly report, left its forecast for 2022 growth in oil demand unchanged at 4.2 million barrels a day, estimating total global consumption at 100.8 million barrels a day.</p><p>Elsewhere in the energy markets, March gasoline RBH22 rose 0.5% to $2.43 a gallon, after gaining 5.2% last week. February heating oil&#xa0;HOG22 rose 2.4% to $2.67 a gallon, climbing 6.1% last week.</p><p>Natural-gas futures, meanwhile, saw their February contract&#xa0;NGG22up 0.9% to $4.30 per million British thermal units. Prices rose 8.8% last week.</p>",
