  "text": "<p><strong>One FT film to start:</strong> Chinese property developer Evergrande was a glittering monument to Beijing's bold economic ambitions — built on a foundation of cheap credit. Could this be China's Lehman Brothers moment? Watch it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/2fce1e2e-52a1-4882-868e-c18802793e8a?playlist-name=editors-picks&amp;playlist-offset=0\">here</a>.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/2fce1e2e-52a1-4882-868e-c18802793e8a.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <h2>The mayor of Londongrad has left the building</h2> <p>For years, Russian oligarch <strong>Roman Abramovich</strong> has quite literally made himself comfortable in London's upper echelons of society. His £100mn-plus Kensington Palace Gardens mansion sits on land leased from the British monarchy.</p> <p>But now the stately home sits empty, along with Abramovich's Thames-side penthouse, helicopters, yachts and cars as the UK government imposed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66540723-08fa-439b-acaa-e74265aa0dce\">full asset freeze</a> and travel ban upon the businessman and six other Russian oligarchs.</p> <p>Though the pitchside action continues at Abramovich's most famous asset — <strong>Chelsea</strong> football club — the team <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e9ba503-3815-4643-b672-8c958109a3de\">can no longer sell</a> as much as a ticket or a blues' jersey at the club shop while the sanctions are in place.</p> <p>The asset freeze has plunged a potential sale of Chelsea into legal limbo — with billionaire and former top <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66540723-08fa-439b-acaa-e74265aa0dce\"><strong>Josh Harris</strong></a> among those considering taking the club off Abramovich's hands. </p> <p>UK officials said a deal couldn't continue as planned, but that the government could consider granting a new licence to permit a disposal if Abramovich was able to demonstrate that he would not receive any of the proceeds. (Look out for more on the chaos unfolding at Chelsea in the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/scoreboard\">Scoreboard newsletter</a> tomorrow, and <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/pages/newsletters/5e5e3d297600b40004c209fc/subscribe/success\">subscribe here</a> if you haven't already.)</p> <p>The UK government has also accused London-listed steelmaker <strong>Evraz, </strong>in which Abramovich is the largest shareholder, of “undermining and threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence” of Ukraine and “potentially supplying steel to the Russian military which may have been used in the production of tanks”.</p> <p>The company's shares were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a703b89c-1f09-49d9-9179-2dfd16f37354\">quickly suspended</a> by the UK's <strong>Financial Conduct Authority </strong>following Thursday's sanctions, “pending clarification of the impact”. Evraz was not directly sanctioned and <a href=\"https://www.evraz.com/en/news-and-media/press-releases-and-news/ownership-and-control-of-the-company-supply-of-steel-by-the-group-/?utm_referrer=https%3a%2f%2fspark.ft.com%2f\">denied</a> the claims, saying it did not make steel for Russia's military. It also sought to distance itself from Abramovich, who it did not consider “as a person exercising . . . effective control of the company” — despite him holding a 28.6 per cent stake in the steelmaker.</p> <p>The UK's crackdown on Abramovich, who was described by lawmakers as a “pro-Kremlin oligarch” that held close links to <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>, <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/2f48216d-2d51-4f78-9117-15cb5c9bad78?\">marks a stunning departure</a> from the billionaire's lucrative 20-year run as the proverbial mayor of Londongrad.</p> <p>Abramovich, who amassed the majority of his estimated £9bn fortune after selling oil group <strong>Sibneft </strong>to Russia's <strong>Gazprom </strong>in 2005, has spent the past two decades being lauded by politicians, financiers and football fans as he poured wealth into London's financial system.</p> <p>For now, UK lawmakers have pulled the plug.</p> <h2>Goldman and JPMorgan lead Wall Street's retreat from Russia</h2> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>was the first investment bank to charge the financial floodgates of post-Soviet Russia. It then became <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/402a96df-fe97-44db-8df0-e0feba2fceaa\">the first to leave</a> as Moscow escalates its war on Ukraine, followed shortly thereafter by <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>.</p> <p>Goldman on Thursday announced that it “is winding down its business in Russia”, where it employs fewer than 100 people. A spokesperson for <strong>JPMorgan </strong>told the FT on Thursday that it has been “actively unwinding” its Russian business and has “not been pursuing any new business in Russia”.</p> <p>The lender run by <strong>Jamie Dimon</strong> has limited its activities in the country to “helping global clients address and close out pre-existing obligations; managing their Russian-related risk”, the person added.</p> <p>Goldman didn't outline a timeframe for when it would complete the withdrawal, but it won't happen overnight — winding down banking operations in a country can take upwards of a year, according to experts. The group will still offer market-making services for buyers and sellers to facilitate trading of corporate debt tied to Russian companies.</p> <p>Prior to its announcement, some of Goldman's staff in Russia decided to relocate to Dubai, said a person familiar with the matter.</p> <p>This isn't the first time Goldman has exited Russia when things got dicey. The bank pulled out of the country in 1994 when business was going slow, only to return a few years later when markets there took off. </p> <p>Back then, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/18/business/easy-money-special-report-for-russia-its-us-bankers-match-wasn-t-made-heaven.html\">according to a New York Times report</a>, the Wall Street lender was eager to offer loans to Russian entities that most commercial banks would file under risky borrowers — its largest being former president<strong> Boris Yeltsin</strong>‘s budding post-Soviet government, in an effort to win new investment banking clients.</p> <p>Today however, Goldman's presence in the country makes up a small fraction of the bank's $2.8tn in assets and liabilities. The bank disclosed last month that its exposure to credit losses in Russia was $650mn and its total market exposure was $414mn as of December. </p> <p>A looming question now is which other Wall Street banks will follow their lead. </p> <p><strong>Citigroup</strong> was in the process of trying to sell its Russian retail banking business well before the war began, but is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/894144b6-c785-4fd5-8a3b-76747bc534dc\">struggling to find a buyer</a> given the current political climate — raising the odds the bank will instead have to foot a costly writedown of the operation. </p> <p>Citi still hasn't disclosed plans to exit its corporate bank in Russia, though the lender has said it was continuing to assess its operations in the country.</p> <h2>The law firms keeping a vested interest in Russia</h2> <p>In the two weeks since Russia first invaded Ukraine, scores of western consultancies, banks and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c959692-49d7-42b6-80e4-4d6877995663\">consumer brands</a> have quit Moscow. Yet a notable divide has emerged between the law firms making a swift exit from the country, and those keeping a foot in the door.</p> <p>The UK's elite group of “Magic Circle” law firms were strong in their condemnation of Russia's military aggression and have pledged to go further than just axing sanctioned clients. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6eeed74a-01c2-4ad5-8e2d-fc936c3ee882\"><strong>Linklaters</strong></a>, <strong>Clifford Chance</strong>, <strong>Allen &amp; Overy</strong> and <strong>Freshfields</strong> have all ruled out working for Kremlin-linked companies and individuals, citing values and ethics. They all plan to exit Russia.</p> <p>Yet some white-shoe law firms have yet to go so far. </p> <p><strong>Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &amp; Flom </strong>said in a memo on Wednesday seen by the FT, that it was relocating Russian-based staff to “ensure their safety” but retaining a “limited administrative presence” in the country.</p> <p>The elite New York-based firm has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/741975b0-18ae-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44\">a long history of advising oligarchs</a> including <strong>Mikhail Fridman</strong> and Roman Abramovich — a relationship developed by former partner <strong>Bruce Buck</strong>, now chair of <strong>Chelsea </strong>football club. An individual close to the firm told the FT's Kate Beioley on Thursday that it had severed ties with Chelsea and Abramovich before the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66540723-08fa-439b-acaa-e74265aa0dce\">new wave of sanctions</a>, and was winding down a litigation mandate for<strong> Alfa-Bank</strong>, co-owned by Fridman.</p> <p>As of Thursday evening, Chicago-based <strong>Baker McKenzie</strong>, a former adviser to the Russian government, had not confirmed a Moscow exit, though it was reviewing Russian clients. <strong>Hogan Lovells</strong> said it was “able to continue to operate” in the country while <strong>White &amp; Case</strong> said its Moscow office remains “open and operational” for now.</p> <p><strong>Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton</strong> — a high-profile adviser to state-owned Russian groups including <strong>Gazprom </strong>— on Tuesday said it was watching the crisis “with shock and dismay” but that it was temporarily closing in Moscow “pending further developments”, rather than winding down completely.</p> <p>Dubai has emerged as a popular destination for Russian oligarchs to seek refuge from western sanctions — and retain legal counsel — as the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6d3b45a-35cc-4e32-b864-b9c0b1649a79\">Simeon Kerr explains</a>. </p> <p>One Dubai-based lawyer told Kate he was fielding requests from Russian lawyers to join his group who were feeling “abandoned” by their western firms. Expect more of that as the days progress. </p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Xavier Rolet</strong>, the former head of the <strong>London Stock Exchange</strong>, <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/1c61216f-504d-4d5c-958d-75c609bf98ad\">has stepped down</a> as chair of Russian fertiliser group <strong>PhosAgro</strong>, whose chief executive was added to the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b45ec05a-7f2b-491f-806e-4e5c0082cdb6\"> EU's sanctions list</a> of businessmen close to the Kremlin.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Marks and Spencer </strong>chief executive <strong>Steve Rowe </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17643d6b-b712-4388-97c0-ebc8b002a0bd\">is to step down</a> in May after six years in the top job in what the company says is part of a planned succession programme.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Purplebricks </strong>chief <strong>Vic Darvey </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d64b9aa-7dfd-4c43-ba7f-efc7903a4307\">is stepping down</a> at the end of the month after almost three years in the job and will be replaced by the online estate agent's chief operating officer <strong>Helena Marston</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>ITV </strong>has appointed <strong>Andrew Cosslett, </strong>an operating partner at private equity firm <strong>Advent </strong>and former chief of <strong>InterContinental Hotels Group</strong>, as its new chair. He succeeds <strong>Peter Bazalgette</strong>, who will step down from the British broadcaster after six years in the role.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Smart reads</strong></p> <p><strong>Crypto catastrophe</strong> Facebook's digital currency project was meant to usher in a financial revolution. The FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a88fb591-72d5-4b6b-bb5d-223adfb893f3\">has the inside story</a> on its epic unravelling. </p> <p><em><strong>Succession </strong></em><strong>in Seoul </strong>Allegations of stock price manipulation and accounting fraud waged against Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/The-trials-of-Samsung-Vice-Chairman-Lee-s-legal-troubles-could-threaten-tech-dynasty\">are threatening to topple</a> his family's legacy, Nikkei Asia reports.</p> <p><strong>Cause and effect </strong>Beijing stayed quiet in the early days of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine to protect its economic interest in Russia.
