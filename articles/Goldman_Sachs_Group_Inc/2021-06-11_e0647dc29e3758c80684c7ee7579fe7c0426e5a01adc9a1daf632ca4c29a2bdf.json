In specific cases, it may help to bring in perspectives from psychology, experimental data or simply from judgment and experience.</p> <p><strong>The plutocrats' guide to space tourism </strong>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is set to go to space next month — or tomorrow, if he subscribes to Prime. The opening of the space market could not be more timely because, frankly, it's getting very hard to plan a holiday and suborbital flight looks likely to be on the green list, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3463e78-d6d2-4e98-bb83-5f21567536f4\">writes Robert Shrimsley</a>.</p> <h1>Podcast of the day</h1> <p><strong>Can Asian prosperity survive US-China rivalry? </strong>South-east Asia has enjoyed a long period of sustained economic growth.
