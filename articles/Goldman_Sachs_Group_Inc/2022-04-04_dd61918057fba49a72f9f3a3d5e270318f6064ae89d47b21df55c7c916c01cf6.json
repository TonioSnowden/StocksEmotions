  "text": "<p>Spac mania was always going to end in tears. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 1,000 special acquisition companies have floated on global stock exchanges, each promising to merge with a fabulous private company and make investors rich.</p> <p>Celebrity sponsors, ranging from sports stars and politicians to Wall Street luminaries, sprinkled glamour on many pitch books, usually in exchange for free shares. Investors fell over themselves to jump in, ignoring warnings about high fees, share dilution and a regulatory loophole that appeared to allow Spacs to make impossibly rosy financial promises. </p> <p>Among them were at least five electric vehicle makers that each promised to hit $10bn in sales, a space transport company that falsely claimed to have “successfully tested” its technology and a music streaming group that told investors it had 4.6mn customers and $120mn in revenue when it allegedly had neither.</p> <p>Two years on, the boom has turned into a bust. More than 600 Spacs are still searching for a partner. Many that did find and merge with a target, a process known as a de-Spac, have failed to live up to the hype. Take the Spac that combined with Romeo Power. When the deal was proposed in late 2020, the battery maker promised 2021 revenue would hit $140mn. The actual number reached was <a href=\"https://investors.romeopower.com/news/news-details/2022/Romeo-Power-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Financial-Results/\">$16.8mn</a>. Its share price has fallen from a high of $27 to $1.50.</p> <p>Shares in the largest de-Spac to date, that of Singaporean superapp Grab, have tumbled nearly 70 per cent since its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc605355-3f3e-44d9-ac70-32cc8dd7407a\">$40bn merger </a>in December. No wonder the Ipox Spac index, which tracks the sector's share prices, is down 30 per cent over the past year.</p> <p>The recent publicity around Spacs has been so toxic that Marwyn, a London-based blank cheque company, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bbd8abfc-dc00-4ec3-b4f2-6f5f45e50e66\">last week announced</a> it would seek a standard listing rather than use the UK's Spac regime. Marwyn chair James Corsellis called the US Spac model “inappropriate”, “misaligned and ill conceived”. </p> <p>Investors are starting to catch on. The flood of Spac IPOs has slowed to a trickle: just 63 floated in the first quarter, down more than 80 per cent on 2021, Dealogic says. De-Spac mergers fell similarly to 32 and are shrinking in size as more investors exercise their right to ask for their money back.</p> <p>Now the US Securities and Exchange Commission is charging into the fray with proposals aimed squarely at stopping the rampant abuses. </p> <p>If adopted, these reforms would explicitly hold Spac sponsors — and their bankers — more accountable for the promises they make of future success. Lying has always been illegal, but the rule change would require projections to be based in reality, as they are when companies join the stock market via traditional IPOs.</p> <p>The changes would also make it more obvious to retail investors just how much of their money would be eaten up by fees and other costs. Spac sponsors will have to disclose more clearly — in standardised, tabular form — their financial conflicts of interests and the ways investors could see their stake diluted in the merger process.</p> <p>The SEC also plans to give Spacs an 18-month deadline to find a target and two years to close the deal, addressing another concern that some Spacs were in effect turning into investment funds.</p> <p>These reforms covered more ground than many bankers and lawyers had expected. Republican Heather Pierce, the lone commissioner to oppose the proposals, complained bitterly that rather than simply setting guardrails, the package “seems designed to stop Spacs in their tracks”.</p> <p>The Democratic commissioners barely bothered to disagree. Caroline Crenshaw said that the current boom had “highlighted a process with significant conflicts of interest and a host of misaligned incentives”, while Gary Gensler, the chair, noted that Spacs' popularity had been boosted by “a perception of regulatory arbitrage” adding that “there's an awful lot of fees . . . for sponsors and bankers and lawyers”. Last year Citigroup was the leading Spac underwriter; this year Cantor Fitzgerald is slightly ahead. Goldman Sachs remains the leading adviser on de-Spac transactions.</p> <p>Spac veterans have long claimed that the structure has genuine benefits when used appropriately. One obvious example is when sponsors bring management expertise or financial clout that a target company would struggle to find on its own. In addition, the structure can give retail investors, who are usually shut out of IPOs until they start trading, a rare chance to put money into early stage companies.</p> <p>Indeed, Spacs have been around since the early 2000s, although transactions were always numbered in the dozens rather than the hundreds until the pandemic.</p> <p>We may never know exactly why Spacs became the financial equivalent of a fidget spinner or a pet rock in 2020. Perhaps investors were so desperate to load up on growth stocks that they latched on to the idea and started buying indiscriminately. Certainly Wall Street was only too happy to gin up supply to meet demand. </p> <p>Angry Spac investors may view these reforms as a day late and a dollar short. Some <a href=\"https://securities.stanford.edu/current-trends.html#collapse1\">54 class action lawsuits</a> have already been filed alleging securities fraud. But that shouldn't stop the commission from driving a stake into these abuses, just in case the Spac tries to come back.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:brooke.masters@ft.com\"><em>brooke.masters@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow Brooke Masters with&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/brooke-masters\"><em>myFT&#xa0;</em></a><em>and on&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brookeamasters\"><em>Twitte</em></a><em>r</em></p><p>Source: Brooke Masters 2022 'New reforms should stop failing Spacs in their tracks' FT.com 4 April.
