  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon has insisted the bank can persuade investors to assign a higher value to its stock, although he warned it may take time and the Wall Street group will not always perform as strongly as it did in its most recent blowout quarter.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83d330b3-e1fd-424c-b2d6-d79682b9b348\">an interview with the Financial Times</a>, Solomon declined to give a timeframe for closing the valuation gap versus its megabank peers.</p> <p>“I don't focus on what the time period will be. I just know that if we keep growing the firm and delivering on our plan over time, the stock and the valuation will take care of itself and we'll get rewarded if we perform,” said Solomon, who this month marks three years as Goldman's chief executive.</p> <p>Under Solomon, the bank's stock is up about 80 per cent and recently hit an all-time high, benefiting from an unprecedented boom in dealmaking and stock market volatility during the coronavirus pandemic. However, it still trades at about 1.5 times the bank's book value, lagging behind peers JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, which trade at closer to two times.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.</em> <em>Here is the rest of today's news — Gordon</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.
