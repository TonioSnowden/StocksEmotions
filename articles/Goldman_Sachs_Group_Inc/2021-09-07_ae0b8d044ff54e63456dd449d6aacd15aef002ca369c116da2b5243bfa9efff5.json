U.S.-stock funds tracked by Refinitiv Lipper (including mutual funds and ETFs) posted an average return of 2.4% in August, to push their 2021 gain to 19.3%.</p><p>Many analysts warn that the stock market is due for a pullback after hitting a series of records, in the middle of an economy recovering from the coronavirus and lockdowns. \"We are in peak everything -- economy, earnings, and [Fed] stimulus,\" says Gene Goldman, chief investment officer and head of research at Cetera Investment Management in El Segundo, Calif. \"Sooner or later the financial markets will need to price in these scenarios as we transition from an early to mid-cycle recovery.\"</p><p>International-stock funds continued to trail their U.S. counterparts, on average. They were up 1.9% in August, pushing their year-to-date gain to 11.3%.</p><p>Bond funds were down slightly for the month. Funds tied to intermediate-maturity, investment-grade debt (the most common type of fixed-income fund) fell an average of 0.2%, to push their year-to-date change to minus 0.3%.</p>",
