  "title": "Goldman Extends  Delay in Return  To Office Until Feb. 1  ----  By Charley Grant",
  "text": "<p>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. again delayed its plans to bring employees back to the office, in response to the spread of the Omicron Covid-19 variant. </p><p>   The bank told employees in an email that they could work from home until Feb. 1, a company spokeswoman said Thursday. Goldman had instructed its workers earlier this month to return on Jan. 18. </p><p>   Goldman had been among the more aggressive banks about returning to in-person work and had largely full offices as recently as last month, but Omicron forced a temporary rethink of those plans. </p><p>   The bank has required Covid-19 vaccines for workers and visitors to its offices since last summer and is doubling down on those efforts. </p><p>   Goldman said last month it would require eligible employees and visitors to receive a booster shot starting in February. </p><p>   Employees who do work from the office are also required to test for the virus twice a week. </p><p></p>",
