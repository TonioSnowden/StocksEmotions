  "title": "Grill Maker Weber to Be Taken Private in $3.7 Billion Deal, With Debt; Majority-owner BDT Capital agrees to buy remaining shares after taking barbecue brand public in August 2021",
  "text": "<p>The deal values Weber at roughly $2.3 billion based on the number of its shares outstanding. Weber put the deal's enterprise value at $3.7 billion, which includes debt.</p><p>BDT's go-private deal comes as grill makers struggle to reclaim the growth they reported during the pandemic-era boom in outdoor cooking. This year, Weber cut its outlook twice, replaced its chief executive and withdrew its financial guidance as restaurants across the nation reopened to full capacity.</p><p>Through the nine months ended June 30, Weber had lost $45 million. Weber has said it would report the final quarter of its fiscal year on Wednesday.</p><p>Weber's board has already approved the deal, and interim CEO Alan Matula said the transaction provides \"immediate and fair value\" to the company's minority shareholders.</p><p>Weber said it expects the deal to close in the first half of 2023 pending regulatory approvals.</p><p>The deal price is 60% above the stock's Oct. 24 closing price of $5.03, before BDT revealed an initial bid of $6.25 each for the Weber shares it doesn't already own.</p><p>Weber shares rose 23% to $8.02 in trading Monday. Before Monday, the stock had fallen about 50% this year.</p><p>The barbecue brand, in business for 70 years, went public in August 2021 and closed its first day of trading at $16.50 a share, an 18% premium above its opening price in what had been a robust IPO market. At the time, the company's former chief executive said that \"people fell in love with grilling again\" after the company reported a 60% rise in sales during the six-month period ended March 31, 2021, amid quarantine and social-distancing orders.</p><p>In November 2021, the stock fell below the company's initial-public-offering price of $14, where it has remained since, falling to as low as $4.82 in October.</p><p>BDT is affiliated with merchant bank BDT &amp; Co., which specializes in advising and investing in family- and founder-led businesses. Its founder, Byron Trott, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive and is known as a favorite banker of famed investor Warren Buffett.</p><p>Write to Colin Kellaher at colin.kellaher@wsj.com</p><p>Grill Maker Weber to Be Taken Private in $3.7 Billion Deal, With Debt</p>",
