  "text": "<p>* Vast Spending With Dubious Returns</p><p>* The Neglect of Diplomacy</p><p>* The Dismantling of Iraq</p><p>A World Suspicious of American Power</p><p>By Margaret MacMillan</p><p>Some memories do not fade with time, and I find it hard to believe that the horrors of 9/11 happened 20 years ago. Yet when I think about the position of the U.S. in the world then and now, I realize how much things have changed.</p><p>After the attacks, sympathy for Americans was heartfelt and world-wide. \"We are all Americans,\" said the left-leaning Paris weekly Le Monde. Russian President Vladimir Putin—yes, Putin—condemned \"the barbaric acts,\" and Russians wept in the streets. In Beijing, the sidewalk outside the American embassy was lined with flowers and cards.</p><p>Twenty years later, Russia and China talk openly about the U.S. as a strategic threat, while even allies such as France and Canada, my own country, have grown skeptical about the uses of American power and wary of American leadership.</p><p>Some of this was bound to happen. No nation, as the British found in their time, is loved for being the world's hegemon. Other states, both friendly and potentially hostile, have their own interests that do not always mesh with America's. Yet the failure in Iraq and now the tragic American withdrawal from Afghanistan have accelerated the perception of the U.S. as a wounded giant, ready perhaps to relinquish its role as what Madeleine Albright once called \"the indispensable nation.\"</p><p>After 9/11, American allies in NATO had been unanimous in supporting the war on the Taliban, but with the exception of the U.K. and a handful of smaller powers, they refused to participate in the war against Saddam Hussein. The international cooperation that had done so much to prevent further terrorist acts started to fray in the face of American unilateralism. As the situations in both Afghanistan and Iraq worsened, American public opinion turned firmly in favor of withdrawal.</p><p>Terrorists and rogue states have grown more emboldened by American failures. Putin seized Crimea, and his \"green men\" wage an undeclared war in eastern Ukraine, while the Iranian Revolutionary Guard carry on destabilizing large parts of the Middle East. The near financial collapse of 2008, the increasingly rancorous divisions in American society, the rapid rise of China under an increasingly confrontational Xi Jinping: All have shaken American confidence and the confidence of America's allies in its leadership.</p><p>We Canadians have always seen the U.S. as a cousin—far richer and more powerful—and we have at times criticized it. But now we find ourselves worrying, in company with many other democracies, about how wounded it is and whether it will withdraw into isolation. Will we have to deal with China instead, or live uneasily in an anarchic, multipolar world? The winds today are cold and picking up. Small nations like my own shiver.</p><p>Ms. MacMillan is a professor of history at the University of Toronto and the author, most recently, of \"War: How Conflict Shaped Us.\"</p><p>A New Age of Conspiracy Theories</p><p>By Ted Widmer</p><p>The Sept. 11 attacks shattered a reality Americans had lived with for as long as anyone could remember. The U.S. had been invaded before: There are still singe marks on the White House to prove it, a legacy of the British invasion of 1814. And the U.S.S. Arizona, lying in the water off Pearl Harbor, bears its own silent witness. But for most of American history, a strike like the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon was inconceivable. We were too far from the world's problems, and too powerful.</p><p>The result was an enduring psychic injury, as damaging as the attacks themselves. The smoke had barely cleared when a new kind of cloud settled, bringing with it a distrust of official answers and a willingness to believe in conspiracies far more outlandish than the one by al Qaeda that had succeeded. As with the assassination of John F. Kennedy, 9/11 was followed by a wave of incredulity, as millions simply refused to believe the official story and instead sought comfort in alternative history.</p><p>The historian Richard Hofstadter happened to give his first version of the talk that became his book \"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\" on Nov. 21, 1963, the eve of the Kennedy assassination. But even he could not have anticipated just how paranoid America would become in the 1960s and 1970s. With each assassination that followed, skepticism deepened over official explanations. The Pentagon Papers and Watergate only added to the public's distrust of government-speak.</p><p>The scorched-earth politics of the 1990s did little to restore confidence. Americans were already growing restive before 9/11, lashing out against the government from Oklahoma City, where right-wing terrorist Timothy McVeigh blew up the federal building in 1995, to Seattle, where left-wing rioters broke up a meeting of the World Trade Organization in 1999.</p><p>The Internet, still coming into its own, added more fuel to these fires. In 1963, Americans got their news from family-run newspapers and three national networks, mostly centrist. By 2001 that world was fading, as 24-hour cable TV and web-based bloggers dominated a fray that was growing louder by the minute.</p><p>Alternative histories grew prolifically in these lush breeding grounds, even after a sober, well-crafted official history was delivered with the 9/11 Report. Since then, conspiracy theorists have proliferated, replacing known facts with a Pandora's box of imagined culprits, including the U.S. government itself. That distrust has been corrosive to our democracy, giving extremists a permanent stage for the politics of unreality.</p><p>Mr. Widmer is Distinguished Lecturer at the Macaulay Honors College of the City University of New York and the author, most recently, of \"Lincoln on the Verge: Thirteen Days to Washington.\"</p><p>Vast Spending With Dubious Returns</p><p>By Adam Tooze</p><p>The global war on terror triggered by 9/11 was a vast undertaking. It took hundreds of thousands of lives, reshaped America's relations with large parts of the world and challenged its moral compass. It also involved spending a lot of money.</p><p>Total spending by the Defense Department, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security from 2001 to 2020, including current and likely future spending on veterans, comes to $5.4 trillion, or about $230 billion a year. That is just over 1% of 2021 [gross domestic product]. That's a lot. But it is also low enough to explain why it was possible for the U.S. to carry on for much of that time as though nothing were happening.The financial impact was further obscured by the way in which the war on terror was financed. Before 2001, U.S. wars were funded through tax increases or major bond drives.</p><p>But the George W. Bush administration introduced tax cuts, resulting in deficits. The lessons [John Maynard] Keynes taught about deficits and debt apply to the war on terror too.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What does 9/11 mean in American history? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Government spending creates income and drives the economy, regardless of what the money is spent on. Most American spending \"in\" Iraq or Afghanistan actually cycled back to the U.S. It is regrettable that the Pentagon allowed itself to be gouged by private contractors, but the employees of those companies earned good upper-middle-class wages, and expanding the ranks of the U.S. military offered new opportunities of upward mobility for minorities and working-class Americans.</p><p>The U.S. issued a lot of debt, but investors showed no lack of appetite. Interest rates slumped as American and foreign investors flocked into Treasurys.</p><p>As Dwight Eisenhower warned, beyond creating demand, military spending reshapes the economy. The war on terror was a notorious boondoggle. But in an age in which Goldman Sachs CEOs ran the Treasury and big tech grew unchecked, the \"camo economy\" was just one piece of a bigger picture.</p><p>The basic reason that military procurement shenanigans bulk so large in the folklore of Washington is that the Pentagon accounts for fully half of all discretionary spending by the federal government. And that is also the saddest thing about the economics of the war on terror. In an age of profound domestic division, one of the few things that Americans could actually rally around was war-fighting. It was the country's largest collective enterprise of the last 20 years.</p><p>And what did it leave us? The cost was vast and out of all proportion to the modest successes achieved. It did not heal the wounds of American society. And in Afghanistan, where the campaign began, it ended in a shameful scramble, leaving vast mounds of abandoned materiel as its monument.</p><p>Mr. Tooze is a professor of history at Columbia University and the author, most recently, of \"Shutdown: How Covid Shook the World's Economy.\"</p><p>The Neglect of Diplomacy</p><p>By Fredrik Logevall</p><p>The most important legacy of Sept. 11 in international affairs is the militarization of U.S. foreign policy and the concomitant neglect of diplomacy. Neither phenomenon is entirely new. For historical and geographical reasons, Americans have always been leery of Old World diplomacy, with its sordid and complex political choices and its emphasis on mutual concessions. The U.S. has often sought to act on the unambiguous platform of moral principle.</p><p>In the post-1945 era, America's technological might has frequently led it to seek military solutions to problems that are at root political. Still, American reliance on military interventions became more pronounced after 9/11. The Cold War had ended, and the Soviet Union ceased to exist; the U.S. dominated global politics as never before. But policy makers failed to learn one of the core lessons of the long Soviet-American confrontation—that nonmilitary instruments were critically important to America's ultimate victory.</p><p>Instead, the U.S. launched a \"war on terror.\" The rapid initial success in Afghanistan in late 2001 only strengthened the inclination to use military means. Instead of including the vanquished Taliban in the postwar settlement, the U.S. gave primacy to counterterrorism operations that antagonized Afghans and soon drove the Taliban back to violence. A little more than a year later, there followed the disastrous invasion of Iraq, and the \"forever wars\" were upon us.</p><p>In the ensuing years, the Defense Department's relative dominance over other national security institutions increased, not just in the administration of George W. Bush but in those of his successors as well. Congress, meanwhile, saw fit to decrease the budget of the State Department, often with little dissent from the White House. The U.S. Agency for International Development shrank in size just as China massively stepped up its development assistance around the world.</p><p>The American fixation on counterterrorism has brought undoubted successes. For 20 years, no group has been able to launch anything remotely akin to the Sept. 11 attacks, either in the U.S. or against American installations overseas. In a bitterly divided Washington, D.C., the policy is a rare point of bipartisan agreement. But counterterrorism has come to be thought of chiefly in military terms, and the limitations have been plain to see. In particular, waging the counterterrorism effort so relentlessly has diverted attention from the complex challenges posed by great-power rivals Russia and China, as well as a nuclear North Korea.</p><p>The time has come to rectify what William J. Burns has aptly called the force-diplomacy \"inversion\" in U.S. foreign policy. For although a potent military undergirds all other instruments of American power, a strong diplomacy is no less vital. The two go hand in hand, as even a cursory glance at U.S. history shows. As John F. Kennedy memorably put it, \"Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.\"</p><p>Mr. Logevall is a professor of international affairs and history at the Harvard Kennedy School and the author, most recently, of \"JFK: Coming of Age in the American Century, 1917-1956.\"</p><p>The Dismantling of Iraq</p><p>By Emma Sky</p><p>Those of us who answered our governments' call to serve in Iraq after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein spent little time debating the lack of connection between the Sept. 11 attacks and Saddam CQ. Our energies were focused on building a new democracy. The magnitude of the ambition was matched by the necessity of the endeavor: to prevent another 9/11. Our leaders repeatedly told us that we were heroes, selflessly serving over there to keep Americans safe in their beds over here. They spoke with fervor about freedom, about the exceptional American democratic system and our generosity in rebuilding Iraq.</p><p>But we knew so little about the history of the country and how severely it had been damaged by decades of war and dictatorship. Those of us who warned about the perils of de-Baathification and dissolving the Iraqi military were directed to the precedent of de-Nazification in post-World War II Germany, the need to set Iraq on new democratic foundations, and the conditions set by our Kurdish and Shia allies for their participation in the new Iraq. No one mentioned that the locals might not be passive recipients of our benevolence, or that early elections and a quickly drafted constitution might not achieve national consensus but rather exacerbate divisions in Iraqi society.</p><p>As we set about our mission with devotion and energy, we had little sense that we were helping to undermine the rules-based international order, damaging America's global reputation and contributing to world-wide democratic backsliding—and to so much death and displacement.</p><p>The dismantling of the Iraqi state led to the country's descent into civil war. A new generation of jihadists mobilized to fight the infidel invaders, with a vision not of democracy but of an Islamic caliphate. Among the chaos, al Qaeda established itself in Iraq. Its successor, ISIS, expanded its control over 10 million people in Iraq and Syria, bulldozing the border between the two countries. The regional balance of power was changed in Iran's favor, exacerbating a geopolitical struggle with Saudi Arabia and turning local grievances into proxy civil wars.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of people fled the region, crossing the Mediterranean on flimsy boats to seek refuge in Europe. ISIS conducted horrific terrorist attacks in European cities, seeking to provoke a backlash against Muslims to show that the West was at war with Islam.</p><p>What happened to the people in the Middle East didn't really matter to most Americans. But the \"forever wars,\" coupled with the 2007-08 financial crisis, contributed to the loss of public confidence in the competence of elites, fueling the rise of populism and democratic decline.</p><p>Although the U.S. remains powerful both militarily and economically, two decades of fighting without winning and the failure of nation-building efforts in the wider Middle East have damaged our credibility as the standard-bearer of a liberal world order. Today, more attention is being dedicated to fixing what is failing at home rather than promoting democracy abroad.</p><p>Ms. Sky is the director of Yale's International Leadership Center and the author of \"The Unravelling: High Hopes and Missed Opportunities in Iraq.\"</p><p>The 9/11 Attacks in Historical Perspective, 20 Years Later</p>",
