  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>Pressure on Russia over its war on Ukraine stepped up a gear today. Nato beefed up its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39caeff3-38cf-44e2-9270-835ab28f13c8\">military defences</a> in eastern Europe while G7 leaders agreed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/522a1894-155c-4234-860d-b4cf5c965376\">new sanctions</a> to prevent Moscow importing technology for its arms industry and tightened measures against those responsible for war crimes and those “stealing and exporting Ukrainian grain”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The G7 summit in the Bavarian Alps comes as western leaders get to grips with a series of crises sparked by the invasion, ranging from worries over food and energy supplies to galloping rates of inflation, all of which are putting the global economy under severe stress.</p> <p>The meeting is discussing a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee090a48-5407-496f-b0e4-1fe78f37495d\">price cap on Russian oil</a> as part of efforts to stymie Moscow's ability to fund the war. Non-G7 countries such as India, which has been a big importer from Russia, are also taking part. The EU has already agreed a phased-in ban on shipments by sea, but allowing crude oil deliveries via pipeline to continue, while the US has banned all oil imports and the UK plans to do so by the end of the year.</p> <p>Energy sanctions should have an effect in the medium term, says the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe54d9e1-286b-4ccf-a5e1-d3b47a7840c2\">Lex column</a>, but in the meantime their implementation will be painful. “What started as an economic shock-and-awe campaign is turning into a war of attrition,” it concludes.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32b68de1-aa60-42c8-adb9-f7881eb56ddd\">global economic outlook</a>, meanwhile, continues to deteriorate and the surge in inflation shows little sign of easing. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b937e023-c86c-4b07-b40d-a3266d84f149\">Bank for International Settlements</a>, the body that operates services for the world's central banks, warned yesterday that leading economies were close to “tipping” into a high inflation world where rocketing price rises become normalised, a process that becomes very hard to reverse.</p> <p>“We may be reaching a tipping point, beyond which an inflationary psychology spreads and becomes entrenched. This would mean a major paradigm shift,” the BIS report said. The key for central banks was to “act quickly and decisively before inflation becomes entrenched”, said BIS general manager Agustín Carstens.</p> <p>Food shortages are also becoming an increasing concern, as blockades of Ukrainian ports threaten supplies to developing countries, especially in Africa, where millions face hunger. Sharp spikes in food prices have compounded problems caused by the pandemic, threatening an “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3336e46-b852-4f10-9716-e0f9645767c4\">unprecedented food emergency</a>”. Unrest over food and fuel prices is also growing in Latin American countries such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb20a5e6-7f8f-42f9-bc48-627a5046888f\">Ecuador</a>.</p> <p>A de facto <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d144a7d4-eba1-4377-9179-88d247688b1e\">naval blockade</a> means Ukraine, one of the world's top grain producers, has been unable to export most of the grain stored in its silos, helping push prices to record highs. Turkey and Russia are set to hold <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3415feed-0e0e-4511-add3-522e6be570ca#post-d6b65b8f-e49f-45eb-87b8-3f8c37021d03\">UN-brokered talks</a> with Ukraine to overcome the impasse in the coming weeks.</p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Record-low share of US midsize businesses <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80508b9a-507c-4ebf-ba15-5a1c2e64f442#post-e7649d10-01bc-4b78-bc60-857e6dfe723a\">pessimistic about economy</a></p></li>  <li><p>Goldman Sachs says more <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80508b9a-507c-4ebf-ba15-5a1c2e64f442#post-14b47435-25f1-4321-b31a-9b31c9eefd49\">job losses loom at Coinbase</a></p></li>  <li><p>UK food standards bodies warn ministers over <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fabb9bc3-52ac-4878-86ec-e64a6937ac6f\">checks for EU imports</a></p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80508b9a-507c-4ebf-ba15-5a1c2e64f442\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p><strong>Russia</strong> was on course to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28817b4e-427c-44c1-88b4-38b79e3da7f0\">default on its debt</a> for the first time since 1998 after it missed a deadline for overdue interest payments. The country has plenty of foreign currency thanks to oil and gas revenues and has repeatedly said it wants to carry on servicing its debt, accusing western governments of trying to force the country into an “artificial” default. </p> <p>“Bad times lie ahead. The question is how bad.” That's the conclusion of chief economics commentator <strong>Martin Wolf</strong> as he assesses the grim impact of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a877d530-059d-4238-93cd-0c1cea5053ab\">high inflation and low growth</a> on the UK.</p> <p><em>A must for DT readers is our July 7 event: capitalising on disruption to create business opportunities. </em><a href=\"https://on.ft.com/3MMPnw3\"><em>Register for free today</em></a></p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>UK taxpayers now own a stake in <strong>Killing Kittens</strong>, a sex party organiser known for its exclusive events, under a scheme set up by the government to help innovative firms <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7186f89a-8953-46ea-85d3-208e9b5cfe8f\">hit by the pandemic</a>.</p> <p><strong>Air travel chaos</strong>, cost of living worries and a weak pound making foreign jaunts more expensive have sparked a surge in bookings by Brits for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fd45ffd-463c-4d83-8993-f1a8dd1982f8\">domestic summer holidays</a>.</p> <p>Plans to end production at the <strong>Groningen reserve</strong> in the Netherlands, Europe's largest gasfield, could be put on ice as the war in Ukraine squeezes supplies — despite its link to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8edef067-f4d8-4cc8-8265-965676c00095\">earth tremors</a> that have led to more than 160,000 damages claims. </p> <p><em>The FT's version of Glastonbury, aka the Weekend Festival, returns on September 3 to Kenwood House in London, featuring a stellar line-up of FT columnists, authors, performers, chefs and much more.

However, there was better news in <strong>Shanghai</strong>, where authorities declared victory over the recent outbreak of infections, lifting stock prices in the process.</p> <p>Authorities in <strong>Tokyo</strong> today told business and the public to save power to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5756305e-5f06-4fec-ac07-c117c45cada0\">avert a blackout</a>, reviving the debate about whether the country should restart its nuclear reactions.</p> <p>The business model of <strong>US farming</strong> with its emphasis on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f04e9e61-4a12-409a-a457-fbda710e9418\">producing cheap food</a> with little regard to nutrition (or the health of the planet), needs to be fundamentally overhauled, writes global business columnist Rana Foroohar. Meanwhile, “<strong>food deserts</strong>” — places without easy access to healthy foods — are deepening <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5848038-d7d4-458d-955b-610bf606d890\">racial disparities</a> in US cities.</p> <p>Investors, homeowners and commercial landlords around the world are all asking the same question: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ec1eaf0-8b43-4fbd-b6a1-2a4d5f10bfbf\">could a crash be coming</a>? <strong>Property</strong> correspondent George Hammond assesses the impact of rising interest rates and the end of the cheap debt era.</p> <p><strong>Brazil's economy</strong> has grown just 2 per cent since rightwing populist Jair Bolsonaro became leader in 2019, while it has also suffered the world's second-highest death toll from Covid.

More than 3,400 went into administration in the year to April, the highest number since the financial crisis.</p> <p>There is no <strong>S&amp;P Vilification Index</strong>, writes US business editor Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, but if there were, it would definitely be on the rise. Executives at fossil fuel companies in particular are feeling the heat from angry consumers over <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45b80dac-2160-4fb3-b9d9-5b7618af5175\">excess profits</a>.</p> <p>The bankruptcy of <strong>Revlon</strong>, the 90-year old US beauty giant, highlights how the industry has changed to a much more <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/475c0a97-b26f-4687-a775-fcc01253d1ba\">competitive and fast-paced model</a>, demanding huge investment in digital marketing and product innovation. “It is as if the big established beauty companies are like a tortoise, who is racing not against one hare, but against hundreds of them,”&#xa0;said one analyst. </p> <p>Chinese chip company <strong>YMTC</strong> is expanding, with a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fc3224a-7fe9-410b-aeb8-0c308a37fb3e\">second plant in Wuhan</a>, as it moves to close the tech and output gap with major players such as South Korea's Samsung and Micron in the US. Meanwhile, Japan's biggest <strong>semiconductor companies </strong>warned that a shortage of engineers could wreck the government's plans to revive its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b90da329-a2e5-486a-860f-a20a3afc707a\">domestic chip industry</a>.
