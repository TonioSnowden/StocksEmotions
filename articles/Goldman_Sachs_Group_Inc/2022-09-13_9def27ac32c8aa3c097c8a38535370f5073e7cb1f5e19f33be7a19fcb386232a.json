  "title": "Goldman to Cut Hundreds Of Jobs Following Reviews",
  "text": "<p>Goldman reinstated those reviews this year following a slump in Wall Street deal-making activity. Goldman had 47,000 employees on staff at the end of June, up from 41,000 a year earlier.</p><p>The New York Times earlier reported on the impending layoffs.</p><p>After a record-setting 2021, the industrywide slump in mergers and new initial public offerings has hit Goldman's bottom line this year. Second-quarter investment-banking revenue fell 41% from a year ago, and Goldman's profit fell by nearly half in that period.</p><p>Chief Financial Officer Denis Coleman said at the time that the bank would slow its pace of hiring and would be slower to replace departing staff as a result of economic uncertainty.</p><p>\"There's no question that economic conditions are tightening to try to control inflation, and as economic conditions tighten, it will have a bigger impact on corporate confidence and also consumer activity in the economy,\" Chief Executive David Solomon said on a conference call with analysts in July. \"I think it's hard to gauge exactly how that will play out, and so I think it's prudent for us to be cautious.\"</p>",
