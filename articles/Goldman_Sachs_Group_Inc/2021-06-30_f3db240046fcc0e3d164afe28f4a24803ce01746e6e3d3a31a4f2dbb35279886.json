  "title": "Toshiba to Embolden More Activist Investors",
  "text": "<p>\"We are seeing a greater degree of openness from Japanese companies than ever before,\" said Chris Vilburn, head of Asia stewardship at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.</p><p>Activists held stakes in just over half of the companies in the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average as of December, according to IR Japan Holdings Ltd., which advises companies on investor relations. The comparable figure for the S&amp;P 500 was 59%, putting Japan not far behind the U.S. \"We expect this trend to continue next year and beyond,\" said IR Japan's Fuka Tanaka.</p><p>There were 44 activist funds working in Japan as of last year, quadruple the figure five years earlier, according to CLSA strategist Nicholas Smith.</p><p>The Tokyo Stock Exchange remains one of the top global markets after the U.S. Companies listed on it were valued collectively at the equivalent of $6.6 trillion as of last month. Yet foreign investors long found it hard to sway management, in part because many shares in big Japanese companies were held by other big companies or financial institutions. The nation's business establishment tended to look on activists as interlopers trying to make a quick buck at Japan's expense.</p><p>That has changed in the past five years or so. Foreign investors have taken a bigger stake at some companies, and Japan's corporate governance code has encouraged management to take shareholder views more seriously. Meanwhile, Japan's institutional investors have begun to act more as U.S.-style asset managers.</p><p>In Toshiba's case, shareholders voted to require the company to commission a report on last year's shareholder meeting. It showed that Toshiba executives and government officials were working behind the scenes to block proposals by activists, and one executive suggested that the best way to deal with the troublemakers was to \"beat them up.\"</p><p>An uproar followed, and shareholders voted last Friday to oust Toshiba's nonexecutive chairman, Osamu Nagayama, by a 56% to 44% vote, as well as another director. Following the earlier departure of others named in the report, the entire audit committee at Toshiba has now been replaced. Directors with backgrounds in the U.S., Hong Kong and Singapore lead key committees.</p><p>After Toshiba, \"activists have been handed a powerful new weapon,\" said CLSA's Mr. Smith.</p><p>Both last year and this year, activists have submitted more than 20 proposals at shareholder meetings in Japan. Traditionally, annual meetings voted only on management's proposals. Activists often focus on companies with idle cash sitting on the balance sheet or poorly performing units that drag down the stock price despite solid assets elsewhere.</p><p>The Tokyo Stock Exchange is revising its listings criteria and establishing a Prime Market for major companies next year with tighter restrictions. In some cases, companies have started to reduce cross-shareholdings in each other so as to make the Prime cut.</p><p>\"It does have a very positive effect. We did not request it, we announced our standard and almost simultaneously some companies did it immediately,\" said Hiromi Yamaji, president of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, in an interview.</p><p>About 65% of trading volume at the exchange comes from overseas investors, and Mr. Yamaji said he would like more of them, whether activist or otherwise.</p><p>Some of the most interesting action in the Tokyo market is happening not at large conglomerates such as Toshiba but at smaller companies where boutique investors can make an impact.</p><p>\"We are looking deeply at the details of operating and performance metrics,\" said Seth Fischer, founder and chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based Oasis Management.</p><p>Last year, Mr. Fischer called on elevator maker Fujitec Co. to cancel its own shares held in the corporate treasury. He said he believed Fujitec shares were undervalued and didn't want treasury shares to be used for acquisitions. Management blocked Mr. Fischer's suggestion last year -- then decided months later on its own to cancel a majority of the shares and award others as employee benefits.</p><p>Mr. Fischer calls such steps the result of engagement. The company said, \"Rather than reflecting the opinions of any specific shareholders, these policies were independently decided by Fujitec management.\"</p><p>Koichiro Doi, head of M&amp;A in Japan and head of activism defense in the Asia-Pacific region with J.P. Morgan, said he expected more such investors to make demands.</p><p>Before Toshiba, some activists took a soft approach by engaging first on environmental, social and governance issues such as calling for more women on the board, Mr. Doi said. \"Now they can be more aggressive, and they will focus on low-hanging fruit,\" looking for companies where valuable subsidiaries and assets aren't sufficiently recognized by the market, he said.</p>",
