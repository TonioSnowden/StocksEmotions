  "text": "<p>A KKR-led investor group is closing in on a deal to buy a song catalogue spanning hits from Lorde and The Weeknd for $1.1bn, the latest sign a private equity-fuelled land rush for music hits is gaining pace. </p> <p>Indie music company Kobalt is in advanced talks to sell the catalogue to a consortium led by KKR, which will take a majority stake, and the family office of Stephen Hendel, a former Goldman Sachs partner, according to people familiar with the talks. </p> <p>Negotiations were advanced and a deal could be announced as soon as this week, these people said. The catalogue had also attracted bids from an Apollo-backed consortium and Todd Boehly's Eldridge Industries.</p> <p>The deal comes as private equity groups have invested billions in the music industry, as they search for places to allocate capital in an ultra-low interest rate environment. </p> <p>The years-long frenzy has only accelerated in recent weeks: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f9ce243-d77a-44f6-a615-384eda335b42\">Blackstone</a> on Tuesday revealed it would back a fresh $1bn fund to buy music rights with Hipgnosis and Apollo announced a $1bn fund with former Morgan Stanley banker Sherrese Soares last week.</p> <p>Private equity groups, specialist buyers such as Hipgnosis, and large music labels have battled for the catalogues of established artists, whose music has enjoyed a new lease on life thanks to streaming. The competition has lifted valuations, effectively doubling prices over the past decade as artists including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/796d0bfc-c55e-4471-8e24-f84948d7a738\">Bob Dylan</a> and Stevie Nicks cash in. </p> <p>KKR earlier this year said it would team up with BMG, one of the world's largest music companies, to target acquisitions of music labels and catalogues. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cf2d759-5f44-486b-a6d4-b0892d51a63a\">Hartwig Masuch</a>, BMG chief executive, told the Financial Times that KKR would provide the financial firepower for BMG to compete for the best assets.</p> <p>The company also this year agreed to buy a majority stake in the catalogue of songwriter Ryan Tedder. </p> <p>KKR and Hendel declined to comment. Billboard reported last week that KKR was a possible buyer for Kobalt's catalogue.</p><p>Source: Anna Nicolaou, Sujeet Indap and Antoine Gara in New York and Nic Fildes in London 2021 'KKR-led group close to $1.1bn deal for rights to The Weeknd and Lorde hits' FT.com 12 October.
