  "title": "Megadeals Yield Record Year for Healthcare Private-Equity M&A; A Bain & Co. report shows there were some 30 transactions globally last year each valued at over $1 billion",
  "text": "<p>These large deals, which Bain classified as megadeals, helped pave the way for a record year in healthcare investing, resulting in some $151 billion worth of private-equity transactions into companies in the sector globally. By comparison, aggregate deal totals reached $66 billion in 2020 and $79 billion in 2019, the previous high water mark.</p><p>Deal activity involving private equity this year isn't likely to surpass last year's record total, as accelerating inflation, rising interest rates and Russia's invasion of Ukraine sow uncertainty in the market. However, take-private deals could become more attractive amid a decrease in public-equity values.</p><p>Large transactions buoyed total deal value in 2021. These included the more than $30 billion deal to acquire medical-supply company Medline Industries Inc. by Blackstone Inc., Carlyle Group Inc. and Hellman &amp; Friedman as well as Bain Capital and Hellman &amp; Friedman's agreement to purchase information-technology business Athenahealth Inc. for $17 billion, including debt.</p><p>Group, or club, deals are also accounting for a larger percentage of overall healthcare M&amp;A involving private equity, according to the report. Nirad Jain, a partner at Bain &amp; Co. who co-leads healthcare private-equity, said it is becoming more common for sponsors to team up with their peers.</p><p>Bain found that the club share of last year's North American deal value was 70%, a shift from the single-asset, single-buyer model that had proliferated in previous years. Group transactions accounted for 25% of 2020 deals in the region and in 2019 they topped out at 30%, according to the consulting firm.</p><p>For deals like Medline, it's a \"chicken and the egg\" scenario as it's difficult for any firm to do a deal of that magnitude alone, according to Mr. Jain. He added that many funds are invested along \"similar macro themes,\" which also led sponsors to come together to do large deals as a group rather than bidding solo.</p><p>Overall, private-equity firms set records last year in fundraising, deal making and exits. The asset class invested some $1.12 trillion in buyouts world-wide. Deal makers were driven to make M&amp;A moves last year partly because of a slowdown in 2020, as well as the possibility of tax changes and a stockpile of dry powder that needed to be deployed reached an estimated $3.4 trillion.</p><p>This activity has increased competition among private-equity firms investing in healthcare, driving up deal values and prices for buyers.</p><p>Potential buyers are also running up against macroeconomic issues, such as how the tight labor market and wage inflation can pose challenges to evaluating companies that are coming to market, according to Ira Coleman, the chairman of law firm McDermott Will &amp; Emery LLP.</p><p>Despite some uncertainty in the market, valuations are still quite high, according to Eric Liu, a partner at EQT AB. The Stockholm investment firm completed one of the sector's top-10 deals last year: an approximately $8.5 billion deal to acquire contract-research organization Parexel International Corp. alongside Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s investment arm.</p><p>\"We have looked at a few things recently where the valuation is still quite high,\" Mr. Liu said. \"The public market may have corrected, but private markets have not.\"</p><p>Mr. Liu said he expects megadeals to be less frequent this year than last year, adding that many of these large deals are done alongside co-investments from fund limited partners. But he said that co-investing is less common this year because fund investors have become more selective as they are presented with many such opportunities and while sponsor firms continue to seek commitments for new funds.</p><p>Kara Murphy, a partner at Bain &amp; Co. and co-lead of healthcare private equity, noted that investors are reflecting on the valuations of companies that have gone public, and whether they might be good targets. \"It would make sense for everyone to be doing their scorecards,\" she said.</p><p>The choppiness in the public markets may create opportunities for private-equity firms this year, according to Mr. Jain. Whether it's take-private opportunities or businesses that previously intended to hold an initial public offering and have decided to run a sale process instead.</p><p>\"I think there's going to be a heightened interest, given all the uncertainty in the public markets, that makes the public-to-private path all the more attractive,\" he said. \"We've seen a heightened interest in exploring multiple exit paths.\"</p><p>Write to Laura Cooper at laura.cooper@wsj.com</p>",
