  "text": "<p>New interest-rate projections are likely to show most Fed officials expect they will need to raise rates more than once next year, a major revision from projections in September, when officials were roughly divided over whether an interest-rate increase would be needed in 2022 versus 2023. They will also update their economic projections, because unemployment has fallen lower and inflation has climbed higher than they expected in September.</p><p>In another sign of how much inflation has jumped, the Labor Department on Tuesday said its producer-price index rose 9.6% in November from a year earlier, the most since records began in 2010. This suggests consumer inflation, which hit a nearly four-decade high of 6.8% last month, will stay elevated into 2022 as price pressures persist.</p><p>Now on to today's news and analysis.</p><p>Top News</p><p>Federal Reserve Prepares Faster End to Stimulus, Making Earlier Rate Increases Possible</p><p>Federal Reserve officials are likely to quicken the wind-down of their bond-buying stimulus program at the conclusion of their two-day policy meeting on Wednesday, opening the door to interest-rate increases in the first half of next year.</p><p>The move to end the stimulus program sooner than officials planned at their meeting last month offers the most concrete sign of how Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's focus is shifting toward preventing higher inflation from becoming entrenched and away from fostering a rapid rebound in hiring.</p><p>Former Fed Uber Dove Recommends Aggressive Rate Hike Path</p><p>Former Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis leader Narayana Kocherlakota wrote in a Bloomberg opinion piece that the Fed must respond strongly to a deteriorating inflation environment. The central bank \"should be prepared to initiate a sequence of meeting-by-meeting rate increases in the first half of next year, and to keep going until inflation comes back down near 2%,\" he wrote. That would likely take the funds rate over 2.5% by the time the Fed is done raising rates, and \"this would come as a shock to markets and would entail some immediate economic pain.\" But it also would eliminate the risk of more pain in the future, Mr. Kocherlakota wrote. The hawkishness of his outlook stands out because he was one of the most dovish central bankers while with the Fed helping to set policy.</p><p>—Michael S.

In a note to clients on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs economists said they believe the Fed will wait a while before allowing its balance sheet to shrink. They forecast a fourth rate increase by the Fed in the first half of 2023, adding that \"our best guess for now is therefore that runoff will begin around that time.\" They noted that research on balance sheet policy \"implies that the impact of runoff on interest rates, broader financial conditions, growth, and inflation should be modest, much less than that of the rate hikes we expect.\"</p><p>—Michael S. Derby</p><p>TD Bank Forecasts Four BOC Rate Increases in 2022</p><p>Economists at TD Bank have updated their call on interest rates in Canada, and now believe the Bank of Canada will need to raise its benchmark rate four times in 2022 to hit 1.25%. The economists say fourth-quarter growth is on track to be nearly as strong as the third quarter's 5.4% annualized advance, and anticipate that above-trend growth will lower the unemployment rate further in the new year. As of November, Canada's jobless rate was 6.0%, or just above the pre-pandemic level of 5.7%. Inflation is likely to remain elevated through 2022 but slow from its late 2021 peak. TD Bank economists see the first BOC rate rise in over three years occurring in April, followed by another increase in June.</p><p>—Paul Vieira</p><p>Basis Points</p><p>The IEA trimmed its 2022 oil supply forecast from non-OPEC producers by 100,000 barrels a day and cut its demand forecast by the same amount, saying it expects the surge in coronavirus cases to stymie the recovery in global demand.</p><p>Reported Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. have surpassed 800,000, with the coronavirus pandemic set to continue into the new year.</p><p>The Conference Board of Canada's business-confidence index fell sharply in November to mid-2020 levels, as inflation and supply-chain constraints have weighed on short-term prospects. The confidence index dropped to 85.6 from a 104.6 reading in August, or the highest level in 15 years.

Reserve Bank of New Zealand Gov. Adrian Orr has done a \"great job\" through the very challenging period of the Covid-19 pandemic, Finance Minister Grant Robertson said, hours after Mr. Orr was questioned about staff turnover at a scheduled meeting of Parliament's finance committee.

Staff on businesses' payrolls rose by 257,000 from October to 29.4 million, according to the Office for National Statistics, while the unemployment rate declined to 4.2% from 4.3% in the three months through October. (DJN)</p><p>The divergence between the European Central Bank and the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to widen in 2022, with no interest-rate rise expected in any foreseeable future by the ECB, says Vincent Manuel, chief investment officer of Indosuez Wealth Management. The ECB will probably \"only focus on piloting its monetary policy in order to avoid an increase of peripheral spreads with 2022 being the year of the switch in asset purchase programs from PEPP to APP,\" he says, referring to the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme and the Asset Purchase Programme.
