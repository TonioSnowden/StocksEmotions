  "text": "<p>Last week I went to the first Anthropy conference held in the biodomes of Cornwall's Eden Project. (The event name comes from the Greek word for “human”.) </p> <p>The conference <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/920ba6d5-0fef-4e51-bbb6-8d0c8bdb05ce\">was convened</a> to reset ideas, to gather people in (often small) groups to share knowledge about effecting positive change for business, society and the natural world.</p> <p>The best workplace innovation I heard about at Anthropy was <a href=\"https://www.dfnprojectsearch.org/about-us/#what-we-do\">DFN Project Search</a>, which works with employers to support young people with autism spectrum conditions or a learning disability, or both, into permanent work. Some 95 per cent of this group don't have full-time, secure work. </p> <p>Founder David Forbes-Nixon, a former investment banker, has a young adult son with a learning disability (who spoke eloquently about his own experiences). Every trainee on the scheme has a coach and spends a year as an intern, showing they can do the job. Employers such as delivery service DPD, many NHS trusts and Goldman Sachs have signed up. </p> <p>DFN has so far helped 2,000 young people in the UK gain full-time work. It's a small organisation but one making a big difference. It highlighted to me how often modern recruitment methods — algorithms, cover letters or video applications, for example — unwittingly root out many applicants who don't meet standard benchmarks. Small changes could have a big impact, for workplaces and for society.</p> <p><strong>Have you got any advice on how to make recruitment practices more inclusive?</strong> Let us know in the comments below or at <a href=\"mailto:workingit@ft.com\">workingit@ft.com</a> and we will cover this in a future episode of the Working It podcast. <em>(Isabel Berwick)</em></p> <p><em>Join CEO and founder Tory Burch alongside leaders from PepsiCo, Etsy, Uber and more at our Women at the Top Americas Summit.

Especially so for leaders. “People are afraid to give feedback, period — that's amplified when you bring in power dynamics”, says executive coach <a href=\"https://melissaeisler.com/\">Melissa Eisler</a>. One of the tools that Melissa uses to help her clients receive the honest feedback that they need is forming a personal board of directors.</p> <p>Many people work with mentors or executive coaches to get support in their professional lives. A personal board takes this a step further; it's a network of people who are there not just to support you, but to offer a critical check on your thinking and provide pushback when needed. Together, they act as a conduit not only for honest feedback, but they can help you practise self analysis and healthy communication.</p> <p>A personal board of directors doesn't need to be formalised. Melissa has one herself, but her “board members” don't necessarily know that they're on it — she treats it more as an informal organising principle in her own mind. Melissa has standing times to meet with two board members twice a month, and has four to five others she speaks with at least monthly. She'll go to a different person depending on what she needs. For example, one situation might benefit from someone who challenges her assumptions whereas another might be better suited for a board member who acts more like a cheerleader, or a partner for brainstorming ideas.</p> <p>When forming your personal board, include a variety of people to fill these roles. “Having a challenger is one of the most important roles,” says Melissa. “I want them to disagree with me — that's part of the point.” Identifying these types of people is particularly important for leaders, because they can too easily find themselves surrounded by “yes men”. Melissa also points out that a single person can play multiple roles — for example, a leadership or executive coach can be both a cheerleader and a challenger.</p> <p>It's important to remember, too, that the purpose of the board is to provide perspectives you might not have considered. The point is not to take this feedback as a directive, but to aggregate it. “Sometimes you need to take what resonates and throw the rest out the window,” says Melissa.</p> <p>There are a variety of attributes to consider in compiling your board; you may want to find someone who excels at making connections, someone who keeps you accountable and even the adversaries or “frenemies” you have at work. You could also include therapists, nutritionists or anyone who helps you achieve your goals.</p> <p>It might seem obvious to put your boss or your direct reports on your personal board, but Melissa says that you shouldn't feel obliged to do so as long as you're already communicating with them frequently.</p> <p>Personal boards aren't just a tool for leaders. If you're more junior, you can still benefit from mapping out who might fill the different “board roles” for you. You'll get a couple of additional benefits, too: you can practise asking people in your network for support and also think about how you can make yourself useful to them in return. Even when you're early in your career, “there's a lot of value you can give”, says Melissa. <em>(Sophia Smith)</em></p> <h1>Listen in: Long Covid in the workplace</h1> <p>This week on the Working It podcast, we look at <a href=\"https://link.chtbl.com/gPBKEPVr\">the impact of Long Covid</a> and ask what managers and colleagues can do to help those who suffer from the condition. I talk to Jana Javornik, associate professor of employment relations at the University of Leeds, about her Long Covid symptoms, and how an understanding manager and a flexible workplace can really help. Then Sarah Neville, the FT's global health editor, explains why workplaces have (so far) been reluctant to address the issue.</p> <p>Next week, we take a look at the so-called war for talent. Despite the economic downturn, people with in-demand skills are always going to have a choice of employment options. How can managers increase their chances of recruiting and retaining the best people? I discuss with author Tyler Cowen and FT management editor Anjli Raval. <em>(Isabel Berwick) </em></p> <h1>Elsewhere in the world of work: </h1> <ol>  <li><p><strong>Retirees are heading back to work: </strong>In need of additional income and wanting to socialise, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8042b200-2cdb-4b0e-a43e-4cb931a55a8a\">older people are looking for jobs again</a> — and employers are happy to offer them flexibility.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Lack of female executives in UK boardrooms ‘appalling': </strong>An annual report by Cranfield University and EY raises concerns that, although companies are complying with targets to appoint female board members, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e05bcfc8-bd8a-4bf5-bd5a-81b3e13fdfa0\">they aren't doing enough to bring women into executive management positions.</a></p></li>  <li><p><strong>Corporations can no longer remain black boxes: </strong>New laws in the US require some companies to publish salary ranges in job listings. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ab3ec60-dcba-4fd7-846f-0acbe36ffa65\">Regulation on pay transparency should force openness in other areas</a>, too, writes Rana Foroohar.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>‘Time to plan for the metaverse.

Readers overwhelmingly agreed.</p> <p>Many of you pointed to swearing as an avenue towards bonding, especially when learning a new language. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35154272-f02e-463c-9668-c9c358191257?commentID=c061cb26-6636-42d9-aabe-d5831e0fc61b\">Reader <strong>ExcitingTimes</strong> says</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>In my country, first thing we teach to foreign friends is how to curse in local language. We want to bond very quickly.</p> </blockquote> <p>Reader <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6993530138491510784?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A6993530138491510784%2C6994598529289572352%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%286994598529289572352%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A6993530138491510784%29\"><strong>Trevor De La Harpe</strong> adds</a> that while swearing is fine, it probably does not belong in the workplace:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Swearing in moderation is a necessary part of life, so long as the wrong person doesn't hear (eg children). However, I don't see a need for it in the workplace, particularly in meetings. Many colleagues agree with me when we say that whenever someone swears in an office environment, they look unprofessional and they go down in our estimation. Also it devalues the point they are trying to make.</p> </blockquote> <p>In thinking about how to deploy them, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35154272-f02e-463c-9668-c9c358191257?commentID=8547d29f-1908-44e3-982b-9378ed9680b4\">reader <strong>Gamma God</strong></a> likens swear words to money:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Swear words are like currency: print too much and they lose their value. The fact that Gillian Tett said [a swear word on television] gave it significant weight, because it is so atypical of her. That's the example I'd like others to follow.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Do you swear at work? </strong><a href=\"https://compass.pressekompass.net/compasses/financial_times/do-you-swear-at-work_financial_times\"><strong>Let us know in this week's poll</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p> <p><em>Responses have been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p>Source: Isabel Berwick and Sophia Smith 2022 'Boost your career with a personal board of directors' FT.com 9 November.
