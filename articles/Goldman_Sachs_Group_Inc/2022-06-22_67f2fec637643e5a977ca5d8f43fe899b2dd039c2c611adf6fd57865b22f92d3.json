  "title": "What a federal gas-tax holiday means for energy prices; 'It's not the best idea': Goldman's Currie",
  "text": "<p>The federal tax on gasoline stands at 18.4 cents a gallon, while the tax on diesel is 24.4 cents a gallon. If the federal gas tax was paused, pickup truck drivers stood to save $5.52 every week, according to Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. At the other end of the automotive spectrum, compact-car drivers would save $2.21.</p><p>Biden was also expected to call on states to suspend their own gas taxes or offer similar relief — steps already taken by several states.</p><p>Read: These states have already enacted gas-tax holidays. So how effective have they been?</p><p>Policy analysts, meanwhile, argued that the White House was unlikely to win approval of the tax holiday.</p><p>Biden is under pressure to address soaring fuel prices and overall inflation ahead of this fall's midterm congressional elections. Markets, meanwhile, were signaling some modest near-term relief may be in store for drivers.</p><p>Oil futures, which hit three-month highs earlier in June, were pulling back Wednesday. West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery CL.1 CLQ22, the U.S. benchmark, was down 3.3% near $106 a barrel. August Brent crude BRNQ22, the global benchmark, was down 3% near $111.30 a barrel.</p><p>Gasoline futures RBN22, which traded at all-time highs above $4.30 a gallon in early June, were off 0.9% near $3.76 a gallon.</p><p>Stocks, meanwhile, were mostly higher for a second day after suffering their largest weekly decline since 2020. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up 48 points, or 0.2%, while the S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 0.3%.</p><p>Currie said the pullback in crude prices was likely attributable in part to rising fears of a recession, which have hit all asset classes.</p><p>He also said that all-time high crack spreads — the difference between the price of a barrel of crude and the products that can be refined from it — explains why the focus is on fuel products rather than the crude market.</p><p>\"The administration is very aware of this,\" Currie said, \"which is why it's targeting products as opposed to the crude…This is an oil refining and product problem as opposed to a crude-oil problem.\"</p><p>Related: This Australian bank has been pessimistic on commodities for months. Here's what it's saying now.</p><p>What a federal gas-tax holiday means for energy prices</p>",
