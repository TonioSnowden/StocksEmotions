The company's bonds have lately fallen out of favor, declining by as much as a third from their trading levels a few months ago, when they were valued close to 99 cents on the dollar.</p><p>Fitch Ratings and S&amp;P Global Ratings also downgraded the company's creditworthiness earlier this week by three and two notches, respectively, citing the company's dwindling liquidity and the coming maturity of the Swiss franc-denominated bond.</p><p>At the end of last year, the company's management attempted to sound out Swiss investors' interest in providing new financing but couldn't drum up sufficient interest, people familiar with the matter said. Efforts to shore up liquidity by selling assets haven't generated sufficient proceeds to satisfy the coming maturity.</p><p>\"We expected Credito Real's liquidity position would strengthen thanks to the various strategies it undertook in the last quarter of 2021,\" S&amp;P Ratings analysts said in a Monday report. \"[But] the company failed to accumulate a sufficient cash buffer to cover its upcoming market debt maturity.\"</p><p>Mexican nonbank lenders have drawn increased scrutiny from foreign investors since this summer, after AlphaCredit Capital SA de CV was rocked by accounting revisions that pushed some of the company's subsidiaries into chapter 11 this summer.</p><p>Write to Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com</p>",
