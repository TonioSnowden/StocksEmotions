  "title": "Qualtrics Adds Up After Cloud Selloff; Rough ride since IPO has turned software provider into a relative bargain",
  "text": "<p>SAP remains a majority owner of Qualtrics, which has led some investors to assign a conglomerate discount to the shares. The stock has been a lackluster performer more or less since its listing, even before a massive selloff hit the entire cloud sector in November, driven by a market rotation out of high-valued and riskier sectors. Ahead of its fourth-quarter results late Wednesday, Qualtrics shares closed 19% below their initial public offering price and 47% down in the last three months. That is worse than most of its peers have fared recently; the BVP Nasdaq Emerging Cloud Index has shed nearly 35% over the same span.</p><p>That seems excessive in light of Qualtrics's solid financial performance. Strong demand for the company's experience-management software has allowed Qualtrics to beat Wall Street's revenue targets every quarter since listing, with the largest beat coming in the latest period. Fourth-quarter revenue jumped 48% year over year to $316 million, with growth accelerating from the 41% rise reported for the third quarter. The company's annual revenue also just crossed the $1 billion mark for the first time, and it projected 31% revenue growth for 2022â€”besting analysts' projections for 28% growth for the year.</p><p>But even with the stock's 6% jump Thursday following the results, Qualtrics is still trading at just over 10 times forward sales. Only one other company on the BVP Index generating more than $1 billion in annual revenue and projected to exceed 30% growth this year trades at a lower multiple.</p><p>That should appeal to investors looking to take advantage of the sector's recent reset. Qualtrics was highlighted in a report by Goldman Sachs last month as one of a handful of cloud software companies \"with balanced growth and margin profiles at a reasonable price\" in the midst of the selloff. And following the latest results, Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer wrote that the stock is \"pricing in a fairly muted future outcome.\" Brian Peterson of Raymond James predicted Thursday that Qualtrics \"will remain on a 30% growth trajectory for the foreseeable future.\"</p><p>In a sector where cheap valuations typically underscore major problems, anomalies like Qualtrics are worth checking out.</p><p>Write to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com</p><p>Qualtrics Adds Up After Cloud Selloff</p>",
