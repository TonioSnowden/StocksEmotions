  "text": "<p>Chinese manufacturing and services activity edged close to a contraction in January, official data showed, as the country's zero-Covid strategy compounds a slowdown in the property sector.</p> <p>China's manufacturing purchasing managers' index was 50.1 in January, from 50.3 a month earlier and just holding above the 50-point threshold that indicates expansion rather than contraction, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.</p> <p>A separate independent gauge of factory activity reflected the downturn is worse among smaller manufactures who are being hit by weakening export demand. The Caixin manufacturing PMI declined to a low of 49.1, from 50.9, near its lowest points since the start of the pandemic.</p> <p>“From December to January, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e30e3677-42b4-4edd-94ba-39e68daf80bf\">resurgence of Covid-19</a> in several regions including Xi'an and Beijing forced local governments to tighten epidemic control measures, which restricted production, transportation and sales of manufactured goods,” said Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group.</p> <p>“It became more evident that China's economy is straining under the triple pressures of contracting demand, supply shocks and weakening expectations.”</p> <p>The official NBS non-manufacturing index, composed of the services and construction sectors, was still in expansion territory at 51.1. but down from 52.7 a month earlier. The decline highlighted the hit to local consumption activity from the lockdowns in several major Chinese cities as well as travel restrictions.</p> <p>The reports showed problems caused by worsening supply chain delays and rising inflation in the world's second-biggest economy.</p> <p>For Beijing's economic planners, Sunday's PMI release underscores <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51caf358-1058-4ee7-834a-c5b5cb8bf205\">persistent unemployment</a>. </p> <p>“The measure for employment fell to its lowest since April 2020, marking its sixth straight month in contractionary territory,” Caixin's Wang Zhe said.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs analysts noted that “high-contact consumer services, including accommodation and transportation, were below [the 50 point marker] due to local outbreaks in January.”</p> <p>The latest data on China's economy came two weeks after the country's gross domestic product in the fourth quarter expanded 4 per cent year-on-year. That <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b0e09fb-1e02-4537-a44b-7b33cd43ba48\">marked a decline</a> from 6.5 per cent growth over the same period in 2020 and the slowest pace of year-on-year growth in almost 18 months.</p> <p>The slowdown has prompted a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84b96b13-18cc-4ad8-9ae9-a86f5d03d81a\">series of&#xa0;monetary and policy easing measures</a> over recent weeks as Beijing tries to minimise collateral damage from a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6840fce2-e550-497a-975d-c765a2117fd2\">real estate crisis</a> as well as counter the effects of restrictions imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/4bcf73fe-0046-4e98-b8b6-c5f976d21820.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Edward White in Seoul 2022 'Chinese manufacturing slows as zero-Covid compounds property turmoil' FT.com 30 January.
