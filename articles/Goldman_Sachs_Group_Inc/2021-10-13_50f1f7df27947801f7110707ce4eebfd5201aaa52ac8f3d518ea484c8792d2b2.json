  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase kicked off Wall Street bank earnings with a big jump in profits driven by a dealmaking boom, but warned that expenses would continue to rise and that demand for new loans remained sluggish.</p> <p>The largest US bank on Wednesday reported a profit of $11.7bn, or $3.74 per share, up from $2.92 per share in the same period last year. Analysts had forecast profit to be flat at $9.4bn, according to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg.</p> <p>JPMorgan reported revenues of $30.4bn for the quarter, up from $29.9bn a year earlier and ahead of analysts' forecasts for $29.9bn.</p> <p>Chief executive Jamie Dimon described the results as “strong” despite the “dampening effect of the Delta [coronavirus] variant and supply chain disruptions”.</p> <p>“Underlying everything, we're still seeing a strong consumer, strong businesses, a lot of capital, a lot of credit,” Dimon said in a call with reporters.</p> <p>However, Jeremy Barnum, JPMorgan's chief financial officer, also flagged that expenses, which had emerged as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73a669c7-a65d-4993-a5d8-f52e019f71d7\">“wild card”</a> for bank earnings this quarter, will “realistically” be higher again in 2022.</p> <p>Costs are being driven up by higher wages in performance-related roles like investment banking but the lender is also investing in technology to compete with new fintech competitors. </p> <p>“We will spend whatever we have to spend to compete with all these folks in our space,” Dimon said. </p> <p>The bank reported signs of loan growth, with total loans in the quarter rising 6 per cent year on year to $1tn, close to analysts' forecasts. The growth largely came from loans from the bank's asset and wealth management division, which were up 20 per cent. Commercial lending was down 11 per cent year on year.</p> <p>Loan demand has been sluggish in 2021 as large companies still have cash left over from large capital raises in 2020 and consumers use government stimulus money to pay down debt. </p> <p>Barnum said loan growth remained “muted” but the bank hoped it “may be poised to begin more robust growth across the company”, particularly in credit cards.</p> <p>JPMorgan, which is one of the largest US credit card issuers, reported growth in average card balances for the first time since the first quarter of 2020, but said it was earning less on those accounts. </p> <p>Card income, a measure of how much the bank earns in non-interest fees on credit cards, dropped 14 per cent, despite a 1 per cent increase in card loans, as JPMorgan accelerated marketing spending to acquire new customers.</p> <p>Overall, it was a “solid quarter”, according to analysts at Baird, who cautioned to “look for muted [stock] gains given high expectations going into the report”.</p> <p>JPMorgan shares were down roughly 2.4 per cent in morning trading in New York. </p> <p>The bank's profits were buttressed by the release of $2.1bn in reserves JPMorgan had set aside at the outset of the pandemic to cover potential loan losses, which have so far been much less severe than expected. JPMorgan's credit loss reserves, which hit a peak of $34.3bn last year, now stand at $20.5bn, above pre-Covid-19 levels of $14.3bn. </p> <p>Earnings were also helped by fees from wealth management and investment banking, which picked up the slack from a slowdown in bond trading.</p> <p>Investment banking fees rose 52 per cent year on year to $3.3bn, exceeding analysts' forecasts for $2.7bn. Investment banks are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a67e0300-98a8-4e29-890a-0949135933ba\">raking in large sums</a> from fees thanks to a rush of dealmaking.</p> <p>The investment banking earnings set a high bar for rivals Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which have results later this week. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Imani Moise in New York</em></p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2021 'JPMorgan boosted by M&amp;A boom but bank warns costs will keep rising' FT.com 13 October.
