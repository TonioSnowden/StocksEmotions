  "text": "<p>On behalf of the corporate and&#xa0;financial elite, Kirkland &amp; Ellis has regularly squared off in some of the messiest commercial disputes imaginable. But a recent distressed debt transaction involving the powerhouse law firm felt a little more ennobling. </p> <p>In a pro bono assignment, Kirkland's financial restructuring group represented beleaguered New York cab drivers who had spent years attempting to resolve crushing loans to buy taxi medallions, the permits necessary to operate cabs. Drivers felt hopeless enough to resort to a recent round-the-clock<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/01/nyregion/ny-taxi-drivers-hunger-strike.html\"> hunger strike</a>. </p> <p>But in early November, lightning struck. A three-way bargain was forged between the city's municipal government, a private equity firm that had become the single largest taxi medallion creditor, and an advocacy group that spoke for thousands of taxi drivers which had the likes of Kirkland and JPMorgan as their pro bono advisers. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/nyregion/nyc-taxi-drivers-hunger-strike.html\">deal </a>slashed loan balances, which for some had previously exceeded $500k, to just $170k allowing drivers to make more manageable monthly mortgage payments. The city stepped in as a backstop party to ensure that private lenders would remain shielded from future default. </p> <p>The plight of New York taxi drivers — largely older immigrant men — has become more appreciated in recent years, in part by a rash of suicides from anguished medallion holders. </p> <p>Under the New York system, the city's taxi and limousine commission fixes the number of medallions. A marketplace of brokers, lenders, fleet owners and fixers developed over the years along with a colourful, if unsavoury subculture. Immigrants were sold on the vision that a medallion, whatever the cost, was the ticket to the American dream.</p> <p>Medallions in the early 2000s had changed hands for $300k. A decade later the price had tripled. Yet by the end of the 2010s the taxi license was changing hands for just over $100k leaving many individual owners well under water. </p> <p>The entry in the 2010s of rideshare providers, Uber and Lyft, was only part of the problem. The New York Attorney General in 2020 <a href=\"https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2020/attorney-general-james-sue-new-york-city-government-fraudulent-practices-taxi-and\">accused</a> the city's municipal government of profiting by more than $800m between 2004 and 2017 by fraudulently marketing medallions to the vulnerable. The city was then under pressure to lead a bailout. </p> <p>An original $65m fund announced in September proved paltry enough that the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, an advocacy group, helped organise the subsequent hunger strike and ultimately brought more heavy hitters to the table including the US Senator Chuck Schumer. (JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, whose bankers were working with the Alliance, sent his well wishes.)</p> <p>The private equity firm involved in the restructuring deal is Marblegate Asset Management, a distressed debt specialist. In 2018, it grabbed headlines for an unorthodox gambit: the firm would eventually begin acquiring loans tied to around 5,000 NYC taxi medallions, or about 40 per cent of total. Taxi medallion loans had previously been the province of local credit unions and regional banks. </p> <p>The revised deal terms sets the value of taxi medallions held by Marblegate at a principal amount of $200k. <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/739-21/mayor-senator-schumer-ny-taxi-workers-alliance-marblegate-asset-management-announce\">$170k of that</a> figure will become a 20-year loan with the remaining $30k covered by a city grant. The loan service payments are guaranteed by the city. The implied monthly payment for medallion holders is to be roughly $1,100 per month. </p> <p>“This wasn't a campaign to cancel debt completely but a collective effort to make it fairer,” said one person whose family owns a medallion.</p> <p>Bhairavi Desai, the longtime leader of the Taxi Alliance, has thanked Marblegate for working in good faith, adding it had worked out well for the private equity firm headed by Andrew Milgram, who had become a licensed cab driver himself. “Any lender would consider a city-backed portfolio to be a prized possession,” she told the FT.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>After the restructuring deal, more mainstream Wall Street institutions are beginning to see a way that they could play in the New York taxi ecosystem too.</p> <p>One person involved in the taxi market speculated that following the restructuring, medallion debt would become standardised enough to be packaged in a securitised product. This person said the likes of Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs have expressed preliminary interest in medallions. The two declined to comment. </p> <p>Drivers themselves will benefit from a reset financing system. As even the taxi labour organiser Desai offered: “Every five to seven years, drivers need to purchase a new vehicle. This settlement allows new capital to look at the industry.”</p> <p><em>sujeet.indap@ft.com</em></p><p>Source: Sujeet Indap in New York 2021 'Wall Street eyes NYC taxis as beleaguered drivers win relief' FT.com 15 November.
