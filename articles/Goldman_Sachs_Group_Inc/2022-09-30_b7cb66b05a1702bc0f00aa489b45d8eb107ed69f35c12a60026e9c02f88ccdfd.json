  "title": "Daily chart; Wall Street extends its worst run since the financial crisis",
  "text": "<p>IT WAS ANOTHER bad month for Wall Street. On September 30th the S&amp;P 500 closed at 3,586, capping a month in which the index of large American stocks tumbled by almost 10%. The index has now suffered its third straight quarter of losses for the first time since 2008-09, when the world's financial system was in meltdown. All told, the market is down by 25% in 2022. Few sectors have been spared from the carnage: just 84 out of 500 firms are in positive territory for the year (see chart). Those hoping to profit from “buying the dip” may be disappointed. Earlier this month Goldman Sachs, a bank, cut its year-end S&amp;P 500 forecast to 3,600, suggesting flat returns for the rest of the year.</p><p>Investors have been downbeat since late August when Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, pledged to keep raising rates until inflation is under control, no matter the pain it inflicts on households and businesses. Although about 90 central banks have raised interest rates this year, all eyes are on the Fed. On September 21st it raised the federal funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, its third such increase since June. Markets expect the Fed to raise its benchmark rate by another three-quarters of a point in November and half a point in December, bringing it to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% by the end of the year.</p><p>Some analysts worry that the Fed may overshoot. Monetary policy works with a lag of 18 months or more. The risk is that, after moving too slowly to respond to inflation, the bank may now be too aggressive. Although the Fed hopes for a “soft landing”, in which the heat is taken out of the economy without provoking a recession, many investors now believe that a downturn is likely.</p><p>Another worry is that inflation may last much longer than expected. In a recent research note Athanasios Vamvakidis, a strategist at Bank of America, analysed episodes of high inflation in advanced economies between 1980 and 2000. Mr Vamvakidis found that once inflation rises above 5%, it takes an average of 10 years for it to return to 2%. This suggests that the consensus view—that inflation in America will come down to 3% by 2024—may be too optimistic.</p><p>As for the fate of the S&amp;P 500, investors are looking ahead to October when publicly listed firms report quarterly results. The early signs are not good. FedEx and Ford, two economic bellwethers, have issued profit warnings. Wall Street analysts are revising down their earnings forecasts. One of the few bright spots for the stockmarket is the stream of cash that continues to flow into investment funds. Candace Browning, Bank of America's head of global research, estimates that inflows into equity exchange-traded funds are already $376bn this year, much larger than the inflows in the whole of 2019 or 2020, as Americans search for better returns than a savings account.</p><p>■</p>",
