  "text": "<p>US president Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin will meet in Geneva on Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d99ae424-ef3f-443e-a9b7-bbbe729478f3\">for talks</a> aimed at arresting a rapid decline in relations between two countries beset by mutual distrust.</p> <p>In their first face-to-face meeting as leaders, the presidents will grapple with accusations, complaints and charges against one another, including alleged Russian cyber attacks and election meddling, US sanctions against Moscow and the Kremlin's misgivings over Nato military expansion in eastern Europe.</p> <p>Other irritants in the relationship are torn-up arms control agreements, the conflict in Ukraine and Moscow's jailing of opposition activist Alexei Navalny — leaving few obvious areas of co-operation.</p> <p>The auguries for the summit are not propitious, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78c45dd8-7beb-400f-8872-45e1a5e34a28\">writes the FT's editorial board</a>. Andrew Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace says the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea1ae16e-e786-4687-8b3a-a21e780a4160\">main question</a> hanging over the meeting is whether the two men are prepared to put on the table to create, in Biden's phrasing, a more predictable and stable relationship.</p> <h1>Five stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Big Tech critic to lead US competition regulator</strong> US president Joe Biden has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bee1b959-b2aa-4ee1-8391-d5b5832ededd\">tapped Lina Khan</a>, a prominent critic of the power of large technology companies, to chair the Federal Trade Commission. Biden's decision elevates the 32-year old <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7945c568-4fe7-11e9-9c76-bf4a0ce37d49\">Columbia University law school professor</a> as Congress vows to crack down on anti-competitive behaviour among the largest US technology groups.</p> <p><strong>2. Oil likely to hit $100 a barrel</strong> The world's top commodity traders told the <a href=\"https://hopin.com/events/commodities2021\">FT Commodities Global Summit</a> on Tuesday that oil would likely return to $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b27ac2bb-69c9-4e06-94e5-f7373b4de5ba\">prediction</a> comes at a time when concern about inflation is rising and many commodities, such as copper, have already reached record highs, boosted by supply shortfalls as the economic recovery gathers pace. <em>Register for day two of the conference </em><a href=\"https://commodities.live.ft.com/page/1734025/register-now\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em> </p> <p><strong>3.

China makes biggest incursion into Taiwan zone </strong>China <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/64778dbb-1b99-425b-b09f-80dd2eb622f1\">flew 28 military aircraft</a> into Taiwan's air defence buffer zone yesterday, its largest such incursion, according to Taipei officials, as Beijing continued to express anger over warnings from western countries and their allies about its military pressure on the island.</p> <p><strong>5. Credit Suisse kicks off Greensill claims </strong>The Swiss bank is <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/0cb03387-9b16-4fd7-a997-6f34d4c4658a\">preparing its first insurance claims</a> on losses stemming from its $10bn of funds tied to collapsed finance group Greensill Capital. Credit Suisse is trying to recoup billions of dollars owed to the group of supply-chain finance funds. </p> <h1>Coronavirus digest</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The delayed <strong>Tokyo Olympics</strong> will need a public bailout of about $800m if the games are held behind closed doors, according to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3cd58c64-039e-4147-a744-af676de1691d\">a Financial Times analysis</a> of organising committee accounts.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>New York</strong> state lifted nearly all remaining <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d03500ae-0baf-4035-bbae-c55f59337fe5\">Covid-related restrictions</a> on Tuesday.

Here is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56ce9fae-6c5d-4a27-83c8-7a40271a9ecc\">a guide</a> on what to expect from the updated “dot plot” chart.</p> <p><strong>Brazil interest rate decision</strong> The country's central bank is expected to raise interest rates by 75 basis points for the third time in a row as it tries to keep a lid on rising inflation.</p> <p><strong>Bank of Canada testimony </strong>Tiff Macklem, the Canadian central bank's governor, will <a href=\"https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2021/06/parliamentary-appearance-governor-june-16-2021/\">appear by videoconference</a> before the country's standing Senate committee on banking, trade and commerce. (Bank of Canada)</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Global banks adopt different back-to-work policies </strong>Goldman Sachs bankers were called back to their desks this week, lured by free food and afternoon concerts. Other lenders including Barclays will also see employees trickle back this month. But the pace at which employees are expected to return varies significantly, according to an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e7761ee-b7a2-48f2-9226-fe20277c2498\">FT analysis</a>.</p> <p><strong>Why is Wall Street's fear gauge so low?</strong> After inflation fears shocked investors in the first few months of 2021, markets have switched into a different mode: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5020a4e1-d136-4c6a-af23-e2ef7d9b23ac\">a deep slumber</a>. Analysts say the quiet period partly reflects the wait-and-see tactics of the Fed, which is prepared to sit out a spell of unusually high inflation. But some investors are growing nervous that complacency is setting in.</p> <p><strong>The US should spurn the false promise of protectionism</strong> Protectionism is back, above all, in the US. Although the tone is different under Biden, the reality is not, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4edc2c5a-298f-4edd-81b7-5b94b7b23b93\">argues Martin Wolf</a>. On the contrary, he says, protection has become one of the few issues on which there is bipartisan consensus. But Wolf argues that we should not throw liberal trade away for the wrong reasons and in the wrong way.</p> <p><strong>Toshiba's sorry tale</strong> Scandal and collapse led to the 145-year-old conglomerate's demotion from the main Tokyo bourse and forced the issuance of $5.4bn in new shares. That brought in overseas activist investors, who wanted more accountability and higher returns. Toshiba complied, at least on paper, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7a3f4d7-8e4e-489a-bb5e-2924977a744f\">writes Brooke Masters</a>. But a damning new investigation makes clear that those promises were hollow.</p> <p><strong>Banning political talk at work is a lazy move </strong>While activism has become the new business currency, some companies want no part in it, banning political comments from work channels. But as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c042ee1-f321-49cd-a586-e1fb29cf9027\">Elizabeth Uviebinene writes</a>, politics and social issues are not only enmeshed in every decision companies make, they shape the world of work. To ban them is hypocritical and alarming.</p> <h1>Life &amp; Arts</h1> <p><strong>Is now a good time to open a new restaurant?</strong> The pandemic has been catastrophic for the hospitality industry.
