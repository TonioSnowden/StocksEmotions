Getting the two “matched up” will contribute to a “very strong” labor market headed into 2022, he said.</p><p>“The big picture is that the taper will get going this year and will end sometime by the first half of next year,” Bullard added.</p><p>More employment data is ahead, with July job openings due at 10 a.m. Eastern, followed by the Federal Reserve's Beige Book at 2 p.m. Eastern and consumer credit at 3 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>“Investors on the whole have enjoyed a fairly decent run this year, but now attention is turning from the post-lockdown spending splurge to how corporate earnings might fare next year,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, in a note to clients.</p><p>“There is a sense that some of the market forecasts have been too optimistic and so there could be some share price disappointment unless we see GDP figures pick up and the COVID delta variant stops causing so much trouble,” he said.</p><p>Read: Stocks may fall 15% by year-end, warns Morgan Stanley.
