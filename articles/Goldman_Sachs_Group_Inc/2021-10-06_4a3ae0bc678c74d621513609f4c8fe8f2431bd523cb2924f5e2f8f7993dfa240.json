  "text": "<p>The gender pay gap in the UK has widened despite efforts by the government and regulators to address the yawning divide between the salaries of men and women that persists across British businesses. </p> <p>According to an analysis by the Financial Times of official data submitted by employers, the disparity between what men and women earn in the same companies is getting worse in many sectors in the UK.</p> <p>Women were paid 87p for every £1 paid to men in April 2020 — when the government compiled the latest figures. This was worse than in 2019, when the pay gap was 12.8 per cent, and in 2018, when the gap was 11.9 per cent.</p> <p>Only about two-thirds of employers reported in 2019, so the FT has also compared with 2018, giving companies two years to improve their pay gaps.</p> <p>The average pay gap for sectors including finance and insurance, education, technology and energy rose during that time.</p> <p>The larger overall gap will come as a disappointment to officials, fair pay campaigners and regulators, which have been pushing companies to address their gender divides. The Hampton-Alexander review, which concluded this year, encouraged companies to ensure that at least 30 per cent of their boards were women. </p> <p>Pavita Cooper, deputy chair of the 30% Club, the gender diversity campaign that has a similar target, said there were “widening gaps in multiple areas”.</p> <p>She said the pandemic had worsened the situation, given the pressure on women to look after children during lockdowns, and with men often among the first to return to the workplace.</p> <p>The extension of the pay gap reporting period during the pandemic also meant less visibility and focus among leadership teams, Cooper added. To help businesses with the impact of the pandemic, enforcement for 2019/20 was suspended and enforcement for 2020/21 was pushed back from April to October. The deadline for submissions was Tuesday night. </p> <p>Banks and law firms were among the employers with the worst pay gaps, which most blamed on having fewer women in senior roles. </p> <p>HSBC had a median pay gap for all UK employees of 48 per cent in 2020 — meaning women earned that amount less per hour on average than men — slightly higher than the previous two years. It said this was because it had “more men in senior and higher-paid roles, and more women in junior roles and lower-paid roles”.</p> <p>“We are committed to further increasing female representation in senior leadership positions, have set targets and have seen year-on-year improvement against these.”</p> <p>The median hourly pay gap at Goldman Sachs International was 36.8 per cent, an increase from 35.5 per cent in 2018 and 34.4 per cent in 2019, which the bank said reflected “an ongoing imbalance in gender representation at our most senior levels”. </p> <p>Women make up only a fifth of the highest quartile of pay at the bank. Chief executive Richard Gnodde said “this issue remains a critical priority for the firm . . . it is working, but it takes time”. </p> <p>At Lloyds, the gap was almost 34 per cent — an increase on the 32.8 per cent in 2018 and 33.5 per cent in 2019 — which it said reflected the fact that it still had “a higher proportion of women in more junior levels and fewer women in more senior roles”. At a bonus level, the gap was about 70 per cent. </p> <p>Barclays has one of the higher median pay gaps at 38.1 per cent but managed to reduce it from 42.9 per cent in 2018 and 41.8 per cent in 2019. </p> <p>Barclays said: “Representation of women in senior roles is improving, however, the nature of this work means it will take time for progress to be reflected in a meaningful way in our pay gap reporting.”</p> <p>Law firms also had some of the highest gender pay gaps. Women were paid 47.4 per cent less than men per hour on average at Slaughter and May, worsening from 45 per cent in 2018 and 43 per cent in 2019. At Allen &amp; Overy, the gap was 46.4 per cent, from 39 per cent in 2018 and 44 per cent in 2019.</p> <p>Other law firms such as Clifford Chance and Hogan Lovells had pay gaps in the low 40s, while Linklaters and Norton Rose were close to 40 per cent.</p> <p>Asset managers were better in the financial services industry, although even there women were mostly paid about a quarter less than men on average. </p> <p>Other companies with higher pay gaps blamed specific gender skews in their teams. Energy group EDF, which has a gender pay gap of about 33 per cent, said this reflected the number of higher-paid male nuclear engineers, for example, while customer services were split evenly.</p> <p>The figures for 2020 have been skewed by the fact that many companies were using the furlough scheme in April, when they needed to report. This meant comparisons for companies in hospitality, retail, aviation, construction and other sectors are more difficult to judge, given most of their employees were not working at the time.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/b222d953-0db2-4dbd-b4f0-4f1e780da71a.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The pay gap at Wagamama was 44 per cent for example, but this was because it employed just nine people in April 2020 — less than 1 per cent of its workforce — when the UK was in full lockdown with all restaurants and other non-essential businesses closed because of the pandemic.</p> <p>The FT reported a gender pay gap of 15.9 per cent, down from above 18 per cent in the two years before.</p> <p><strong>Methodology</strong></p> <p>The FT uses the median, or the middle of the distribution, as a measure of average pay because it most accurately reflects the experience of most employees. The mean measure is easily skewed by a few high-earning individuals. But the median is very resistant to outliers. More on this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ee99efa-d9d9-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482\">here</a>.</p> <p>For the average of the pay gaps of multiple companies, we have used a mean of medians. This is imperfect, but without individual salary information it is impossible to calculate a true average.</p> <p>In our best/worst-performing sector analysis, we exclude sectors with fewer than 50 company submissions because a small sample size is more vulnerable to having its average skewed by outliers. Sectors in which more than 30 per cent of the workforce was furloughed were also removed.</p><p>Source: Daniel Thomas, Oli Elliott, Dan Clark 2021 'UK gender pay gap widens despite pressure on business to improve' FT.com 6 October.
