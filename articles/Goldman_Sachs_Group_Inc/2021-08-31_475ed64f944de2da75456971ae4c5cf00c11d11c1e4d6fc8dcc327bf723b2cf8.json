  "title": "House Rents Pop Up as New Investors Pile In; Sharp rise partly reflects increasing demand from people who can't afford to buy homes, pandemic-driven newcomers",
  "text": "<p>Would-be home buyers priced out of the sales market are finding little consolation when they turn instead to the single-family rental market.</p><p>Prices are soaring there as well. Asking rents for houses rose nearly 13% for the year to date through July, the highest annual increase in the past five years as tracked by real-estate data company Yardi Matrix, which analyzed professionally managed properties.</p><p>The sharp rise partly reflects increasing demand from people who can't afford to buy homes as well as city-dwellers who moved to the suburbs to rent during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the supply of new houses also continues to trail historical levels relative to population growth, and builders in some places remain constrained by zoning laws and available land.</p><p>Price increases are more moderate for single-family tenants renewing their leases, said Haendel St. Juste, a real-estate securities analyst at Mizuho Securities USA. \"You've got to be careful in this industry. You can't be perceived as gouging.\"</p><p>Apartment asking rents also have risen, but at a slower pace: 8.3% for the year to date through July, Yardi Matrix said. The difference partly reflects weaker demand in downtowns that lost population after Covid-19 hit, although those markets have rebounded in recent months.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is the best way to address the shortage of single-family properties? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Many rental apartment landlords also have been hurt during the pandemic by eviction moratoriums and unpaid rent. Some of the largest single-family operators, which target six-figure income households, are more insulated from these problems, which have disproportionately troubled lower-income housing owners. But some also continued to file evictions, catching attention from lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives, who said in July they would investigate.</p><p>For renters hoping to step up and become single-family homeowners the news isn't encouraging. Heated competition among home buyers this year led to for-sale home prices rising 23% on an annual basis last quarter.</p><p>But for investors, the single-family home market has been heralded as a pandemic success story. Shares of the two largest companies, Invitation Homes Inc. and American Homes 4 Rent, have climbed 38% since late February of 2020, compared with about 10% for the largest apartment companies over the same period, according to real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors.</p><p>Wall Street also is doubling down on home buying. Investors purchased $87 billion in homes in the first half of 2021, according to real-estate company Redfin, including a record 68,000 houses in the second quarter.</p><p>Since June, Blackstone Group Inc., Invesco Ltd. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alone have committed more than $11 billion to the sector. Meanwhile, other companies are building rental homes from scratch. New houses meant to be rented instead of sold account for about 12% of single-family construction in 2021, said Doug Ressler, a researcher at Yardi.</p><p>Tricon Residential Inc., a publicly traded house owner, reported new lease rent increases of around 21% in July, a record for the company. The average hike was a more modest 5% for renewal tenants. In an August earnings call, Gary Berman, Tricon's chief executive, said in some markets the company could fetch close to 10% rent increases for existing tenants if it didn't intentionally \"hold back.\"</p><p>Tricon launched a $5 billion fund this summer, backed by Pacific Life Insurance Co. and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, to acquire 18,000 more houses and convert them into rentals. It is also purchasing new construction homes through a separate venture. \"What we tell prospective investors is look, we can't satisfy the demand. We need a lot more supply,\" Mr. Berman said.</p><p>Deep-pocketed investors may have a hand in would-be buyer woes: one in six home sales went to an investor in the second quarter of 2021, according to Redfin. In Atlanta, Phoenix and Miami, it was one in four.</p><p>\"The institutional players are chasing some of the same homes that would be starter homes for owner occupiers,\" said Desiree Fields, a geography professor at the University of California, Berkeley who researches the single-family rental industry.</p><p>The single-family rental market has become more standardized since Wall Street firms began pouring in after the subprime crisis. More institutions now view the suburban home as a core asset, on par with apartment buildings or office towers, which have long been features of large investor portfolios. More software and technology is also available to help manage and operate thousands of disparately located houses.</p><p>That is a shift from the first wave of single-family investors, who snapped up foreclosed homes after the financial crisis and flipped them a few years later, said Chris Poston, an executive at Darwin Homes Inc., a company that manages rental home portfolios. \"You're seeing folks that are really focused on 10-plus-year hold periods and operations and cash performance,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Will Parker at will.parker@wsj.com</p><p>House Rents Pop Up as New Investors Pile In</p>",
