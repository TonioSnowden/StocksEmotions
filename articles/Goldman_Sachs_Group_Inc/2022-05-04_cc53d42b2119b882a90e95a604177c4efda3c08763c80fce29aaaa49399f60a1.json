  "text": "<p>Randy Frankel in 2021. PHOTO: Heather Walsh for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>The buyer, who couldn't be identified, was represented by Reid Heidenry of ONE Sotheby's International Realty. Mr. Heidenry said his client had been looking for properties in the area for about six months.</p><p>Mr. Frankel didn't respond to requests for comment. A former partner at Goldman Sachs, he paid about $14.41 million for the newly built house in 2020, according to property records. He spent \"a couple million\" on renovations, said Mr. Gojanovic.</p><p>Designed by Domo Architecture + Design, the house has an interior courtyard, an elevator and 14-foot-high ceilings, said Mr. Gojanovic.</p><p>The roughly half-acre lot has a dock, a pool, an outdoor kitchen and a rooftop deck, said Mr. Gojanovic. He said Mr. Frankel also added a Balinese-style water feature with stepping stones.</p><p>This isn't the only property Mr. Frankel has recently sold. He unloaded one Miami penthouse for $6.45 million in January 2021 and another for $9.491 million in December 2021, but he still owns property in the Miami area, said Mr. Gojanovic. He also owns vineyards on Long Island and a house in the Hamptons. In addition to his stake in the Rays, he also owns several country clubs, gyms and stakes in several European sports teams, Sotheby's said.</p><p>\"I co-own a baseball team, four soccer teams in Europe and four country clubs in Florida. I buy stuff,\" he told The Wall Street Journal last year.</p><p>Luxury single-family homes in Miami Beach sold for an average of about $17.86 million in the first quarter of 2022, roughly even with prices at the same time last year, according to a report by Douglas Elliman, though Mr. Gojanovic said he has seen price hikes among ultraluxury properties in the area.</p><p>\"There is a very limited amount of inventory available for waterfront properties,\" said Mr. Heidenry.</p><p>Write to Sarah Paynter at Sarah.Paynter@wsj.com</p><p>Tampa Bay Rays Co-Owner Scores $31.5 Million for Miami Beach Home</p>",
