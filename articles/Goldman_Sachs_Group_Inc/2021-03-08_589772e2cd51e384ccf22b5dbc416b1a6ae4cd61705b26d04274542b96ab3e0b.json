  "title": "Hakluyt seeks to ‘demystify' in a crowded consultancy market",
  "text": "<p>Varun Chandra would like to make clear that the most exciting thing outsiders think they know about the consultancy he leads is untrue: Hakluyt has “no relationship with the spooky world, so that's that”.</p> <p>“For certain kinds of businesses, trading off some sort of . . . mysterious link with the powers that be [or] the security services may be helpful,” says Chandra, who was <a href=\"https://www.hakluytandco.com/hakluyt-elects-varun-chandra-as-managing-partner/\">elected</a> Hakluyt's managing partner in 2019 at the age of 34, determined to “simplify and demystify” the firm. “It's not helpful to [us] because we don't have [those links]. And we don't want to project that we have them.”</p> <p>The company was, though, founded in 1995 by a group of former MI6 UK intelligence officers. It was named after the Elizabethan writer, priest, geographer and diplomat (some would say spy), <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Hakluyt\">Richard Hakluyt</a>. Once known as the most secretive firm in a secretive sector, it still operates discreetly from a Mayfair townhouse that could hide a private wealth manager or high-end law firm. </p> <p>But where Hakluyt's online presence used to be a single page, it now has <a href=\"https://www.hakluytandco.com/\">a fuller website</a>, with profiles of partners, press releases and a sparse explanation of its emphasis on “discretion and independence of thought”.</p> <p>Once you eliminate the mystique of a home for ex-spies with a licence to pry, though, what distinguishes Hakluyt from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c0eb958-dca9-11e6-9d7c-be108f1c1dce\">other advisers</a> scrambling to sit at the right hand of business leaders? In a digital world, is there a future for a “completely analogue business . . . built on human relationships”?</p> <p>Chandra declines to name names but he implies Hakluyt is neither a mini-McKinsey nor a cut-down Kroll, the corporate investigations group. Steven Fox, founder of Veracity, a similar firm, likens Hakluyt to a tailor: “It's about making a bespoke suit and the difference is that they now want to make the bespoke suit in a way that you see how the tailoring is done.”</p> <p>About half of its 120 staff are client-facing. Many have had “some form of job in government”, says Chandra. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c074fae-f435-4d6d-9eb0-f1c9d7b3210a\">Dan Rosenfield</a>, a former UK Treasury official, was a Hakluyt consultant before becoming Prime Minister Boris Johnson's chief of staff last year. Other consultants are ex-lawyers, bankers and journalists (including former Financial Times staff). Only seven have a background in intelligence. </p> <p>A typical assignment might consist of assessing “the thinking of the people on the other side of the table”, says the managing partner. “What do they care about? What is their intent? What are their motivations?” Tasks might include reviewing the chequered history of a company's potential partner and advising how they might work together, as well as the likely competitive and regulatory landscape for the deal. </p> <p>The firm first decides whether the client's request is a “Hakluyt-shaped problem”, rejecting 20 per cent of possible engagements. If it takes on the work, partners tap a network of “several thousand well-connected individuals”. Some of these individuals are paid, often very well; other senior contacts are happy to share intelligence in exchange for occasional tickets to the opera or cases of fine wine. </p> <p>Lord Paul Deighton, the former Goldman Sachs banker who once headed the London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games in 2012 and now chairs Hakluyt, admits the group's services can be a hard sell. “What I always say to the chief executive is [that] to make a good decision, you want to have a level of confidence that is a bit north of 70 per cent. Anything above that is unnecessary certainty. When you're below that, you're thinking ‘Christ, I'm making this decision. And I really don't know.' And what Hakluyt is good at is helping you get from 30 or 40 per cent, to 70 per cent.”</p> <p>Its reports are delivered in a form the firm's Elizabethan literary namesake would recognise: a succinct, well-written, rigorously edited analysis of 20 or so pages, distinct from the data-heavy slide decks of other consultancies. </p> <p>Hakluyt's <a href=\"https://www.hakluytandco.com/#InternationalAdvisoryBoard\">international advisory board</a> provides a clue as to the kinds of companies that fuel its revenue, which it projects will top $100m in the year to June 30. It is chaired by Niall FitzGerald, former chief executive of Unilever, and includes the ex-heads of Coca-Cola, Rolls-Royce, and Tata, as well as a former director of GCHQ, the UK signals intelligence hub.</p> <p>But Chandra must overcome some obstacles to secure a different reputation for the firm. One is its lingering shadowy legacy. Neil Heywood, the British businessman <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fafc502a-e2db-11e1-a463-00144feab49a\">poisoned by the wife </a>of Chinese politician Bo Xilai in 2012, had advised the firm. <a href=\"https://d1e00ek4ebabms.cloudfront.net/production/uploaded-files/Sunday Times MI6 (1)-9c96d371-3468-4f5d-ab4e-9ed3c5dcccc6.pdf\">The Sunday Times reported in 2001</a> that Hakluyt had used a German agent to spy on Greenpeace and other environmental campaigners for oil companies. </p> <p>The line that marks unacceptable business from acceptable has “moved significantly as [the] firm has professionalised,” says Chandra. In the seven years he has worked there, he cannot think of a client the company should have been embarrassed to work with. He says snooping on an NGO would now be well beyond the pale. </p> <p>Another challenge is to continue to convince clients of the value of its bespoke work, and to maintain rigour about the quality of its information.</p> <p>According to others in the industry, Hakluyt's clients pay a premium for its reports, often well into six figures, and sometimes twice as much as rivals. </p> <p>“I always joke that they put an extra zero on the bill,” says the head of one firm. A senior figure at another competitor says Hakluyt's “sweet spot” is government relations work, but it is at risk of “grossly overcharging” for “normal intelligence gathering”. A third suggests that, in the past, the cost meant Hakluyt sometimes struggled to win repeat business. </p> <p>A different, internal threat is posed by a potential lack of diverse thinking. A quarter century of consultants hiring people who look and sound like them means that at partner level, the firm is still 85 per cent male (though the proportion drops to 60:40 male/female for all staff).</p> <p>“I'm from Newcastle [in north-east England]. I grew up in South Shields, I'm brown, I didn't go to one of those schools, I don't wear a signet ring . . . so even me being in this role is indicative that this place doesn't care [about candidates' background],” says Chandra. The group does not have specific targets for ethnic diversity but it does now aim to interview as many women as men for open roles.</p> <p>The final challenge is to fill gaps in its network. Last year Hakluyt opened a Silicon Valley office to tap potential technology business. Having repeatedly turned away cyber security assignments — not a Hakluyt-shaped problem — it has also now hired a handful of consultants from the US National Security Agency, GCHQ and elsewhere. Veracity's Fox points out extreme secretiveness would be inconsistent with another Hakluyt aim: to advise more companies about environmental, social and governance issues.</p> <p>Chandra claims Hakluyt has not diverged much from the founders' hunch that they could use “the art of conversation through well-connected people [to] generate interesting insights that could have a commercial use”. But, according to one competitor, that is “a bit old-fashioned, a bit 2000s”. Having cleansed the firm of the dangerous whiff of spycraft, its articulate and ambitious young leader still needs to work hard to set Hakluyt apart from a mass of cheaper advisers and fact-checkers.</p><p>Source: Andrew Hill and Harry Dempsey 2021 'Hakluyt seeks to ‘demystify' in a crowded consultancy market' FT.com 8 March.
