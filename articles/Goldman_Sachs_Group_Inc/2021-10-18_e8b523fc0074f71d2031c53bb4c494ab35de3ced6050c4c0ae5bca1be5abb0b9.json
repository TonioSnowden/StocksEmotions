  "title": "Rent the Runway Targets Valuation of Up to $1.5 Billion in IPO; Clothing-rental company set to launch roadshow on Tuesday",
  "text": "<p>The targeted range is above the $1 billion the company was valued at in early 2019, before the pandemic largely eliminated the need for work clothes and eventwear. Last year, its valuation shrank to roughly $750 million as Covid-19-related office and other closures caused as much as two-thirds of the company's subscribers to pause or cancel their memberships.</p><p>Founded in 2008 by Jenn Hyman and Jenny Fleiss, Rent the Runway began as a \"shared designer closet\" from which women could rent single items for special events. It has since grown to offer a range of clothes from fancy to casual, and most users are now subscribers to its service that allows them to borrow a set number of items each month for a flat rate.</p><p>But Covid-19 forced Ms. Hyman, Rent the Runway's chief executive, to cut the company's costs by 51% and furlough or lay off half theworkforce. She also raised new financing.</p><p>The company still struggled. Revenues decreased by 39% to $157.5 million in fiscal 2020. Active subscribers shrunk to about 54,000 in the summer of 2020 from more than 133,000 as of Jan. 31 of that year. This year, however, there has been a rebound as widespread access to Covid-19 vaccines paved the way for social gatherings and a return to the office for some. Its active subscriber count was nearly 98,000 as of the end of July 2021.</p><p>The IPO will be closely watched, despite the company's size, given its relatively high profile. The new issue market is running at a record pace and investors are watching for signs of whether the year will end on a strong note and whether others planning listings, like Rivian Automotive Inc., will succeed.</p><p>Rent the Runway is aiming to capitalize on the growing trend of \"do-gooder\" companies, emphasizing how renting clothes instead of purchasing them is better for the environment.</p><p>Write to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com</p><p>More IPO Coverage</p><p>More WSJ coverage of initial public offerings, selected by the editors.</p><p>* Saks E-Commerce Unit Begins IPO Preparations (Oct. 17)</p><p>* Goldman Sachs's Petershill, a Collection of Private-Equity Stakes, Slides After IPO (Oct. 15)</p><p>* Digital-Advertising Company Aleph Files Confidentially for IPO (Oct. 14)</p><p>* Volvo Cars Announces IPO Plan That Could Value It at $25 Billion (Oct. 4)</p><p>* New Platform Backed by Fidelity, Goldman Seeks to Bring IPO Market Into Digital World (Sept. 23)</p><p>Rent the Runway Targets Valuation of Up to $1.5 Billion in IPO</p>",
