  "title": "BT lifts broadband target despite weak earnings",
  "text": "<p>BT has hiked its targets for rolling out fibre broadband even after delivering annual earnings and current year guidance that were weaker than market expectations.</p> <p>The telecoms group set a target of extending its full-fibre broadband network to 25m premises by the end of 2026, a 5m upgrade on previous guidance. Installations will roll out at a pace of up to 4m a year, from 3m previously, with BT flagging that it may consider joint ventures to cap costs.</p> <p>As a result, BT's capital expenditure will increase to £4.9bn in 2022, about £500m higher than the consensus estimate. </p> <p>For the full year to March BT reported adjusted ebitda down 6 per cent to £7.4bn as average revenue per broadband user slipped. Staff bonus costs meant the earnings figure was about 1 per cent lower than consensus forecasts.</p> <p>For the fiscal year ending 2022 BT guided for ebitda of between £7.5bn and £7.7bn and free cash flow of between £1.1bn to £1.3bn, well below the £1.4bn consensus. BT also revealed an agreement with pension fund trustees to pay £1.1bn a year towards its £8bn deficit, falling to £800m over time.</p> <p>“Although the outlook looks clearly positive . . . the near-term cash downgrade will probably dominate sentiment today, and we expect a negative reaction to the shares,” said Barclays analysts. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Burberry</strong> said the recovery from Covid-19 disruption accelerated since the start of the year with fiscal fourth-quarter same-store sales up 32 per cent year on year. The fashion house reported group revenue for the year to March down 11 per cent to £2.3bn and adjusted operating profit 9 per cent weaker at £396m. The full-year dividend was reinstated at 2019 levels of 42.5p per share on the back of “strong cash generation”.</p> <p><strong>Schroders</strong> explored a potential acquisition of fellow asset manager <strong>M&amp;G</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-12/schroders-studied-m-g-deal-to-build-1-trillion-asset-manager\">Bloomberg reported</a>. Schroders was working with a partner earlier this year to consider a break-up of M&amp;G by splitting its asset management operations from its pension and insurance unit, but abandoned the idea after deciding M&amp;G would be too expensive, it reported citing people with knowledge of the matter. </p> <p><strong>Hargreaves Lansdown</strong> said conditions look more positive than they did in December though given uncertainties it cannot predict levels of new business or client activity. The investment platform reported net new business of £4.6bn in the four months to the end of April. Record dealing volumes meant year-to-date revenue was up 19 per cent to £532.7m but share dealing both for the UK and overseas has begun to slow, it said. </p> <p><strong>Rolls-Royce</strong>&#xa0;left 2021 targets unchanged in an AGM trading update. In the first four months of 2021 large engine flying hours were around 40 per cent of 2019 levels, which was broadly unchanged from the run rate at the end of 2020, the jet engine maker said. Rolls continued to expect to turn free cash flow positive at some point during the second half of 2021.</p> <p><strong>FirstGroup's</strong> largest shareholder has accused its management of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bd06ad33-86d4-4f04-bb61-70081a3a6ac1\">bungling the multibillion-pound sale</a> of its US bus business earlier this year. New York-based activist investor Coast Capital Management said FirstGroup's £3.3bn deal to sell its US bus operations to Swedish private equity group EQT's infrastructure fund significantly undervalued the business and “stinks to the heavens”.</p> <p>Testing and certification group <strong>Intertek</strong> has agreed to buy Australia-based&#xa0;peer SAI Global Assurance from private equity firm Baring Private Equity Asia for A$855m (£470m). </p> <p>Full-year results from <strong>3i</strong>, the private equity investment group, showed its net asset value rising to £9.2bn or 947p per share, from £7.6bn or 804p the year before.</p> <p><strong>Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust</strong>, Baillie Gifford's FTSE 100-listed technology investment fund, reported a net asset value up 111 per cent for the year ending March.</p> <p><strong>Kier</strong>, the infrastructure services group, set out plans to raise £241m via a firm placing and open offer. The new shares will be sold at 85p apiece, a 17 per cent discount to Wednesday's closing price. Kier had flagged the need for a cash call to repair its balance sheet when delivering half-year results in April.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <p><strong>Balfour Beatty</strong> has appointed Charles Allen, former chief executive of ITV and Compass, as its next chair. Allen&#xa0;will take over in July from Philip Aiken, who has chaired the construction services group since 2015. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>Elon Musk <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/052853fa-9816-4624-8dd3-6321c01ac875\">reversed his backing for bitcoin</a> on Wednesday and announced that <strong>Tesla</strong> was suspending plans to accept payment for its cars in the cryptocurrency. He put the change of heart down to environmental concerns about the mechanism used to validate bitcoin transactions. In other digital currency news, Facebook <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c5a72fe-48e9-467c-8a9e-cd2d3a3deafd\">is shifting Diem to the US</a>. The social media group will partner with a domestic bank to issue a US-dollar backed stablecoin. It has also dropped an application to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority to operate as a payments service and will register with the US Treasury instead.</p> <p><strong>Hertz's</strong> shareholders stand <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f41eac59-3404-4504-b698-b4ead8f149df\">to recover hundreds of millions of dollars</a> after the car rental company accepted a bid from a private equity consortium that includes Knighthead Capital, Certares Opportunities and Apollo Global Management to bring it out of bankruptcy protection. The deal will see all of Hertz's existing creditors paid off in full as the company will raise more than $7bn in fresh debt and equity, leaving the reorganised company with less than $1bn of debt. Elsewhere, <strong>Volvo's</strong> board on Wednesday evening agreed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47637b0c-5445-4f1e-9e35-c45ad604591f\">to resurrect plans</a> for an IPO.</p> <p><strong>Sotheby's</strong> is tapping lenders to fund a $300m <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0296097-fb00-409d-b9b2-3fab02185da6\">dividend to its owners</a>, led by businessman Patrick Drahi, after returning to profitability thanks to cost cuts and lay-offs during the pandemic. The auction house, which Drahi agreed to buy in 2019 for $3.7bn, is planning to raise the cash in a debt sale organised by banks including Goldman Sachs, according to documents reviewed by the Financial Times.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Katie Martin</strong> While the Federal Reserve has committed to keeping policy super accommodative even in the event of above-target inflation, some rate setters have started <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6ec0695-a4be-4336-b64b-5b10614f8ae9\">mentally preparing the market</a> for an eventual return to normal. The past few days and weeks show that investors are going to have to learn to live with this.</p> <p><strong>Bryce Elder</strong> How best to spend £9bn? According to Ivan Menezes, Diageo's long-serving chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c91a398-e31c-4c78-8494-9ab82d7162f7\">it's on Diageo shares</a>. Menezes's cash return policy has looked pretty shrewd so far; investors owe him the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'BT lifts broadband target despite weak earnings' FT.com 13 May.
