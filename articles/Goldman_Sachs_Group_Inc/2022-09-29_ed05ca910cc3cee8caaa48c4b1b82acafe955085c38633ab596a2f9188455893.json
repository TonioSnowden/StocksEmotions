  "title": "6 U.S. Banks Will Assess Their Climate Resilience in Fed Pilot Program; Big banks—Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman and others—will participate in the Fed-run pilot next year as climate preparedness joins more conventional risks",
  "text": "<p>The pilot program will be separate from the typical stress-tests banks undergo to determine whether they have sufficient capital to continue lending in a downturn. Participating banks won't face capital or supervisory implications from the pilot, the Fed said.</p><p>The move comes amid sustained attention from U.S. banking regulators and the banks themselves on hazards the financial sector might face from climate change.</p><p>The pilot test will be used to help identify risks and promote risk management practices, the Fed said.</p><p>\"By considering a range of possible future climate pathways and associated economic and financial developments, scenario analysis can assist firms and supervisors in understanding how climate-related financial risks may manifest and differ from historical experience,\" the Fed said.</p><p>The exercise envisioned by the Fed is expected to begin in 2023 and wrap up by the end of the year, the regulator said.</p><p>At the beginning of the exercise, the Fed will publish the variables—climate, economic and financial—that will be used in the scenarios. At the end of the pilot, the Fed will share the insights gained—without releasing firm-specific information.</p><p>The Financial Services Forum, a trade group that includes the six participants, said its members look forward to working with the Fed.</p><p>\"Our members recognize the need for sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks and have incorporated such risks into their risk-management frameworks for the past several years,\" spokeswoman Barbara Hagenbaugh said.</p><p>Many large banks have been thinking about climate risks for years, said Michael Littenberg, a partner at the law firm Ropes &amp; Gray LLP who advises companies on environmental, social and governance issues. Scenario analyses can range from running through relatively straightforward qualitative exercises to more sophisticated quantitative work, he said.</p><p>\"This is a very complex area,\" Mr. Littenberg said. The Fed is correct in taking up the issue in conjunction with the big banks, given \"that there is no single right way to do this,\" he added.</p><p>The Fossil-Free Finance campaign of the Sierra Club, an environmental group, called the program a \"promising start.\"</p><p>Federal and state banking regulators have increasingly emphasized climate-related risks as demanding consideration among the more conventional risks that financial institutions face.</p><p>In December, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released draft guidance on how large banks should address climate-related risk. Earlier this month, the OCC also appointed Yue (Nina) Chen, a risk expert with experience at New York's financial regulator and at major banks, as its chief climate risk officer.</p><p>The big banks themselves are also weighing the issue. In January, 19 banks and the Risk Management Association formed a consortium to jointly address climate-related risks.</p><p>Write to Richard Vanderford at richard.vanderford@wsj.com</p><p>6 U.S. Banks Will Assess Their Climate Resilience in Fed Pilot Program</p>",
