  "title": "U.S. News: U.S. Home Sales Slow As Costs Increase",
  "text": "<p>The median sales price of an existing home climbed to $416,000 in June, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday, up 13.4% on the year and the highest since records began in 1999.</p><p>At the same time, sales of previously owned homes fell for a fifth straight month, dropping 5.4% in June to an annualized rate of 5.12 million, NAR said. That was lower than the number of sales recorded in all of 2019, before the Covid-19 pandemic became widespread in the U.S.</p><p>\"A combination of higher prices and higher mortgage rates have clearly shifted the dynamics in the housing market,\" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. \"People who want to buy are simply priced out given the affordability challenges.\"</p><p>The housing market has frozen as participants adjust to the increase in mortgage rates, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.</p><p>\"Buyers can't figure out what is the right price,\" he said. \"Sellers are very reluctant to give up\" on the price they expected to sell for a few months ago, he said.</p><p>Following Wednesday's home-sales data, Goldman Sachs economists lowered their forecast for second-quarter economic growth by 0.1 percentage point to a 0.5% rate. IHS Markit economists also lowered their forecast by 0.1 percentage point. They now forecast a 2% drop in gross domestic product in the second quarter.</p><p>The Commerce Department will release second-quarter growth data on July 28.</p><p>Almost 15% of home-purchase agreements that were pending in June fell through, the highest level since April 2020, according to real-estate brokerage Redfin Corp.</p><p>\"We have a lot of people that are just sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what happens with interest rates and the overall economy,\" said Phil Mount, a real-estate agent in Boise, Idaho. \"People aren't buying right now because they're nervous.\"</p><p>Despite the higher prices, homes are still selling quickly, suggesting that demand remains resilient for now. Properties remained on the market 14 days in June, the fewest in records going back to 2011. The inventory of homes for sale has increased but remains low with a three-month supply of unsold homes. Total inventory at the end of June stood at nearly 1.26 million units, a 9.6% increase from May.</p><p>But housing demand could fall in the months ahead. In a separate report Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association said mortgage applications fell a seasonally adjusted 6.3% in the week ended July 15 from the prior week, the third straight drop. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 5.51% in the week ended last Thursday, up from 2.88% from a year earlier, according to Freddie Mac.</p><p>Higher borrowing costs are partly due to the Federal Reserve's aggressive path of interest-rate increases. Fed officials lifted rates by three-quarters of a percentage point in June, and officials will likely make a similar move next week.</p>",
