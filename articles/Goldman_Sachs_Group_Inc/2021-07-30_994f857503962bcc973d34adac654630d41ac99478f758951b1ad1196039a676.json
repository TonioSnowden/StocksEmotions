  "text": "<p>UK government officials have become more optimistic about the prospects of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/befd81e6-904a-4131-af3a-16dcd10890b5\">strong economic recovery</a> in the second half of the year as chancellor Rishi Sunak fired the starting gun for new autumn economic forecasts.</p> <p>Sunak hailed “fantastic” figures showing a 560,000 fall in the number of people receiving furlough money in June to 1.9m and asked for the new forecasts to be prepared for October 27. These are likely to be published alongside a long-term public spending settlement. </p> <p>However, he wants to damp any over-optimism that might increase pressure on him to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52adf0da-f7fb-45e6-ba16-6ec039ed7b4a\">loosen the public spending taps, </a>including from his Downing Street neighbour Boris Johnson.</p> <p>Official figures on Thursday showed that the number of confirmed Covid-19 hospital cases fell for the first time since late June with 5,056 patients being treated for the virus compared with 5,182 on Wednesday. </p> <p>One ally of the chancellor said: “At the moment things are looking good but there's a lot of uncertainty around Covid, and everyone is being cautious.”</p> <p>Despite a second daily rise in coronavirus cases, the figures suggested economies with high vaccination rates could increasingly live with the virus, according to a Goldman Sachs research note. </p> <p>“Our analysis confirms that vaccinations have been a key factor that has kept hospitalisations low,” said Nikola Dacic, analyst at Goldman Sachs, adding this suggested that across Europe there were now “manageable Delta variant risks”. </p> <p>In an examination of the trends of Covid cases, including a bulge that coincided with the Euro 2020 football tournament, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research suggested there was still an underlying decline in the prevalence of the virus across the UK. It said “herd immunity may be in sight”. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ddc304f-dc45-4223-b652-4e014a746c41\">better economic prospects</a> have emerged after a month of generally disappointing data as the Delta variant took hold across the country. Rising infections have made consumers more reluctant to spend and the need for people to isolate has reduced those at work in July. </p> <p>The hope is that these brakes on activity will ease in the weeks ahead as the link between case numbers and severe disease is greatly weakened. Although officials are aware there have been many false economic dawns during the coronavirus pandemic, there is greater optimism now that the economy is on track for a durable recovery. </p> <p>The last official figures for May showed output in the UK economy to be 3.1 per cent below its pre-pandemic level. On Thursday, official data for the US economy indicated that it had recovered all its lost ground in the second quarter, something that is unlikely to be repeated in any leading European economy. </p> <p>Although the IMF's latest forecasts announced on Tuesday show the UK economy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1ee290c-851d-41fb-8205-5615d211cd87\">will grow strongly this year</a>, at 7 per cent, this comes after one of the largest dips and the agency does not expect the pre-pandemic level to be reached until the start of 2022, after Germany, Japan and Canada among G7 countries. </p> <p>If a weakening Delta wave allows a stronger economic recovery in the autumn, the forecasts to be published by the Office for Budget Responsibility for the public finances will be significantly stronger. </p> <p>Sunak effectively announced on Thursday that his multiyear autumn spending review will take place on October 27, when he must decide budgets for key Whitehall departments for the rest of the parliament. A fierce battle for cash lies ahead.</p> <p>He has asked the OBR, the independent fiscal watchdog, to produce new fiscal and growth forecasts for that day and it is common for the two events to run in parallel. The Treasury said a formal date would be announced in September. </p> <p>Senior Conservatives predict a tense autumn, with Johnson making a series of spending requests — including more money for the NHS, schools, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55657f11-4c61-4c3b-ae1a-36be9f9db72f\">social care,</a> tackling climate change and his “levelling up” agenda — while Sunak frets about the need to keep borrowing under control.</p> <p>The prime minister's allies this week seized on the IMF's upgraded growth forecasts for the UK. But fiscal hawks in the government noted that the big IMF growth forecast upgrade — up from 5.3 per cent — partly reflected the pessimistic outlook assigned to the UK in its last forecasts and was no better than domestic forecasters.</p> <p>Sunak has not yet said whether he will hold a full Budget as well as the spending review in the autumn. Government officials said he could delay it until the spring, depending on the progress of the pandemic.</p> <p>The big question for the OBR in the spending review will be whether to change its assessment that there will be long-term damage to economic prospects from coronavirus. </p> <p>If it sticks to its assumption from the March Budget that coronavirus is likely to result in the economy being 3 per cent smaller persistently than its pre-pandemic forecasts, any rise in the growth rate this year will be offset by weaker forecasts in future, leaving the public finances still extremely fragile. </p> <p>But if it decides that the better outlook will encourage more business investment and shallower longer-term scarring to the economy, the public finances outlook will be brighter, not just in 2021-22 but also in the medium term.</p> <p>Many independent economists and the IMF have become more optimistic that the pandemic will not leave deep lasting scars and the fiscal watchdog has committed to reviewing this crucial assumption in its autumn forecasts. </p><p>Source: Chris Giles and George Parker in London 2021 'Sunak optimistic as pace of economic recovery picks up' FT.com 30 July.
