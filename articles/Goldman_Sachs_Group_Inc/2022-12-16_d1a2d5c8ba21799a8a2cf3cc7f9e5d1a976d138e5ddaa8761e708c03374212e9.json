  "title": "Meet Mazars, the accounting firm that keeps finding itself at the center of controversy; Mazars dumped the Trump Organization after years of legal wrangling over its tax returns and is now parting ways with the beleaguered crypto industry.",
  "text": "<p>On Friday, the accounting firm said it was parting ways with several cryptocurrency businesses, including Binance, Crypto.com and Kucoin. Again, the firm said it was similarly no longer confident in financial reports it had produced for the companies.</p><p>So what is the Mazars Group?</p><p>The low-profile, mid-sized firm dates back to 1945 in Rouen, France, when it was founded by Robert Mazars, a 20-year-old accountant who wanted to help rebuild his war-ravaged country, small business by small business. He began with a handful of local merchants, providing tax services and continued as the firm's chief executive until 1983.</p><p>Since 2016, the group has been helmed by Herve Helias, a 30-year veteran of the firm.</p><p>Mazars now spans the globe, with 44,000 employees bringing in €2.1 billion ($2.23 million) in fees in 2021, up roughly 10% from the year before, according to its annual report.</p><p>Nearly 75% of its business remains in Europe, but it has been growing abroad. It now counts on the Americas for 13% of its business and Asia for 9%. French companies still account for nearly a quarter of its clients.</p><p>While it still falls some ways behind the \"Big Four\" accounting firms — Ernst &amp; Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG and Deloitte — it counts some major companies as clients. Over the years, it has provided accounting services to finance giants like Axa XE:AXA, BNP Paribas FR:BNP and Goldman Sachs GS, carmaker Peugeot, and advertising firm Publicis FR:PUB.</p><p>Mazars had worked for Trump and the Trump Organization for years before Trump became president, and found themselves embroiled in a long-running legal fight with investigators and Congress over producing his tax returns and the company's statements of financial condition.</p><p>The courts ultimately ruled that Trump and Mazars had to hand the accounting reports over. In February, Mazars said it could no longer stand behind its work and parted ways with Trump, saying it couldn't vouch for the veracity of the numbers it had been provided to produce its reports. In September, Mazars handed documents related to Trump over to Congress.</p><p>Mazars had recently produced \"proof of reserves\" reports for its crypto clients that have sought to detail their abilities to meet customer withdrawals following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and a number of other crypto businesses.</p><p>But the accounting firm has since removed the reports from its website and said it was pausing doing business with the crypto firms because of \"the way these reports are understood by the public.\"</p><p>\"Proof of reserves reports are performed in accordance with reporting standards relevant to an agreed upon procedures report. They do not constitute either an assurance or an audit opinion on subject matter. Instead they report limited findings based on the agreed procedures performed on the subject matter at a historical point in time,\" Mazars said in a statement.</p><p>.</p><p>Meet Mazars, the accounting firm that keeps finding itself at the center of controversy</p>",
