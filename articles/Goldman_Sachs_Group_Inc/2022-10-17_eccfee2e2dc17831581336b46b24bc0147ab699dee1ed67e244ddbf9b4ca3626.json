  "text": "<p>Drawing on United Nations demographic and International Monetary Fund fiscal data, they created what they call the Global Gaidar Model, drawing on the name of the Russian institute of one of the co-authors. They focus on five variables — population growth, population aging, productivity catchup, fiscal adjustment and automation.</p><p>As of 2017, Western Europe and China each accounted for about 17% of world GDP, with the U.S. at 16%. By 2100, they expect a very different story, with China and India becoming the world's top two economic hegemons, accounting for 27% and 16% of world GDP respectively, with the U.S. and Western Europe share at about 12% each.</p><p>The real surprise could be Sub-Saharan Africa, where in another scenario, it vies with the U.S. for top billing. That's based on a study which expects an almost complete end to Chinese, Indian, Russia, Eastern European and former Soviet Union catch-up labor productivity growth. While the authors call that scenario \"implausible,\" they also acknowledge that worker productivity growth in Western Europe, North Asia, the U.K., Canada and other countries has trailed U.S. growth in the last two decades after exceeding it in the five decades following World War II. \"Hence, what seems implausible to us may be exactly on target. The one constant in the record of relative economic growth is its inconsistency,\" they say.</p><p>In one final scenario, if the catch-up growth rates observed between 1997 and 2017 continue into the future, then India comes out on top, with nearly 34% of world GDP. In that scenario, China's number two at 22%, while the U.S. is down at 10%.</p><p>The study also suggests there's a pending capital glut, because of the high savings rate in China, India and other regions that are aging. \"This simulated capital deepening dramatically reduces our baseline model's world interest rate – from 5.98% in 2017 to 1.18% in 2100. Importantly, major capital deepening arises under all three sets of catch-up growth rates,\" they say. Regions like the U.S. with low national savings rates will import capital, meaning that even if they maintain or increase their share of world GDP, their share of gross national income could decline.</p><p>The markets</p><p>A big drop in U.K. bond yields BX:TMBMKGB-30Yhelped set the stage for a rise in U.S. stock futures, with the Dow YM00 contract up more than 300 points.
