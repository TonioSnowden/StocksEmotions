  "text": "<p>With Credit Suisse having been deemed one of 30 systematically important global banks, it's a given that investors would ponder its impact on the broader financial system. But Wall Street seemed to shrug off these concerns, at least for the moment, as most big banks joined in an overall surge in equities SPX following bruising selloffs in recent sessions.</p><p>Market Snapshot: Dow surges 600 points as stocks attempt bounce-back after brutal September</p><p>Shares of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM rose 2.2%, Bank of America Corp. BAC advanced by 2.5%, Citigroup C rose by 1.1%, Morgan Stanley MS moved up by 2%, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. WFC jumped 3.3%, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
