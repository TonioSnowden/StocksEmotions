  "text": "<p>If only social-media platform Reddit -- co-founded by Serena Williams's now husband, Alexis Ohanian -- had that kind of nerve and timing. Redditors took the market by storm last year, fueling a retail frenzy in meme stocks such as GameStop that turned investing fundamentals on their head, briefly making the WallStreetBets forum the center of the financial universe. Founded in 2005 in a dorm room, Reddit is one of the most visited websites in the world with more than 50 million daily active unique users as of January. In an era of tech hubris, Reddit is a rare case of underreach and founders who didn't know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em.</p><p>The company was sold in 2006 to media company Conde Nast for $10 million. As of last August, it was privately valued at $10 billion. In late 2020, Mr. Ohanian tweeted that, at the time of the sale, he thought he was \"getting away with something\" after what amounted to 16 months of work. He wrote that, back then, there were a lot of things he desperately needed to learn such as management, team building and leadership. A better sense of timing would have been handy, too.</p><p>Co-founder Steve Huffman, who now serves as chief executive, presumably has the management part down, and it looked as if he learned to strike while the iron is hot. Reddit doubled its value in a private transaction days after GameStop mania, launching its first-ever Super Bowl ad. But the plans to raise capital were made before the episode.</p><p>Less auspicious was Reddit's waiting to file confidentially to go public until late last year, just as tech-stock valuations began to turn. An expected offering in the first quarter led by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley never happened. Sentiment has since gone downhill for the ad-based social-media business.</p><p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is down 23% this year. Last week, Bloomberg reported Fidelity Investments slashed Reddit's valuation in April, marking down its stake by more than a third from the preceding month. And since then, Snap Inc., parent of ads-based social-media platform Snapchat, lowered its guidance, citing an unfavorable macroeconomic environment that deteriorated \"further and faster\" than it anticipated. That declaration led to a single-day drop in Snap's stock of 43%, dragging the social-media sector down with it.</p><p>When Reddit's WallStreetBets became a place that critics said helped separate fools from their money, it earned Mr. Huffman an audience with Congress. He testified that investing advice on the forum was \"probably among the best\" because it has to be embraced by a crowd. Next time, he probably should just embrace whatever WallStreetBanks tell him.</p>",
