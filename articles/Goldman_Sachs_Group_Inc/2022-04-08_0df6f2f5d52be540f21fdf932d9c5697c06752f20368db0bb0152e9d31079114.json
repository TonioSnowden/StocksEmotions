  "text": "<p>Customers of pharmaceuticals company Gelesis take its pills to lose weight. </p> <p>Executives at the group had another concern when Gelesis was merging with a blank-cheque company: losing investors. </p> <p>Before the merger closed, the deal team sweetened the terms to entice investors not to flee. Yet 99 per cent of investors pulled their money anyway, enabling Gelesis to raise only $105mn instead of a planned $376mn. The Boston-based drugmaker later <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/31/business/gelesis-slashes-marketing-team-after-disappointing-debut/\">fired </a>140 marketing staff. </p> <p>The generous investor provisions for the Gelesis merger are another sign of how the once-hot market for special purpose acquisition companies (Spacs) has fizzled. Power has swung from executives offering deals to the investors needed to back them. Even then, some investors balk. </p> <p>Spacs are shell companies that raise money from investors and list on the stock market. Their sponsors then search for a private company to take public through a merger. Investors who funded the Spac listing are able to withdraw their money before the merger if they do not like the chosen target company. </p> <p>Those transactions are becoming harder to complete. Nineteen mergers have been cancelled this year compared to three in the same period last year, with many failing due to a combination of high investor redemptions and inadequate cash from private investors via a structure known as a Pipe. </p> <p>Spac investor redemptions hit 81 per cent in March, according to Dealogic. Adding uncertainty to the market, the US securities regulator last week proposed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/28d9d0c7-aab3-4d75-9aa2-22d8b9efdef8\">sweeping reforms</a> for Spacs.</p> <p>Pill maker Gelesis merged in January with Capstar Special Purpose Acquisition Company. The Spac vehicle was run by Steven Hicks, a 28-year veteran of the radio industry and founder of investment firm Capstar Partners. </p> <p>The terms offered to investors included a $15mn backstop agreement, in which capital is put up to replace investor withdrawals. The deal team also tried to entice investors by forfeiting roughly 2mn shares from the sponsor group composed of Capstar Partners and Pimco, giving investors access to them for free. </p> <p>The deal also featured an earnout clause in which investors would receive extra shares if the company's stock price traded high enough for long enough once the merger had closed. </p> <p>“There's very little leverage and Spac sponsors very much want to get a transaction done,” said Anna Pinedo, partner and co-head of global capital markets at Mayer Brown, a law firm. “They are very receptive to and understand the need to be flexible.”</p> <p>Gelesis, whose shares are down 45 per cent since its merger, declined to comment. Capstar did not respond to a request for comment. </p> <p>Dealmakers are offering investor-friendly agreements in almost every deal, desperate to close their transactions or risk abandoning the merger. </p> <p>“A number of Pipe investors feel like they've been burnt, so the hedge funds that are still interested have arguably their pick of the litter to choose the best deals with the most attractive terms,” said one mergers and acquisitions lawyer. </p> <p>The terms “are helping some deals get chosen and proceeding to signing”, the lawyer added, while others are “just dying on the vine, because they're not getting traction”.</p> <p>During the 2020 heyday of blank-cheque vehicles, some sponsors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b481c63-f9b4-4226-a639-238f9fae4dfc\">earned billions</a>, typically by taking 20 per cent of the Spac's equity for a nominal price of $25,000 that converts into a smaller stake once the merger is completed. </p> <p>Sponsors are now surrendering some of these perks in an attempt to win over investors. The forfeiture in the Gelesis deal brought the backstop investors in at $4.30 a share, a steep discount to the typical $10. </p> <p>“Clearly that the Spac agreed to this kind of backstop agreement shows that it was very hard to find investors who had any kind of confidence that the [deal valuation] was even close to correct,” said Michael Ohlrogge, a professor at New York University law school who studies Spacs.</p> <p>Other dealmakers are offering investors bonuses in exchange for not redeeming their shares.</p> <p>The planned Spac merger for <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-deals/China-s-Fosun-in-1.5bn-deal-to-sell-Lanvin-fashion-unit-to-SPAC2\">Lanvin Group</a>, the fashion arm of Chinese conglomerate Fosun International, offers a bonus pot of 3.6mn shares that will be split among non-redeeming shareholders. Former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn presented a similar term in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37a48ffb-59b4-446f-98f5-723f6864ddd6\">his blank-cheque deal</a> to take lottery operator Allwyn public.</p> <p>“It's a prisoner's dilemma,” said one M&amp;A lawyer. “Ideally you want everybody else to redeem except you so you get the bonus, but there's an inflection point.”</p> <p>In certain instances, dealmakers are being more forthright and simply putting cash on the table.</p> <p>Hong Kong-listed digital media company Hypebeast agreed this week to a Spac merger that would give it a second listing in New York. Non-redeeming shareholders will receive a quarterly $0.05 cash dividend per share until the deal — which is backed by NFL star Tom Brady, tennis champion Naomi Osaka and other celebrities — has closed.</p><p>Source: Nikou Asgari in New York 2022 'Spac dealmakers sweeten terms to stem investor flight' FT.com 8 April.
