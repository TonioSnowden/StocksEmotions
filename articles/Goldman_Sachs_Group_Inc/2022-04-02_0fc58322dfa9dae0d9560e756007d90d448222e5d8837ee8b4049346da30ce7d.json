As you might expect, Scoreboard's bid is extremely competitive. Funding secured and all that. </p> <p>OK, that's not really how the conversation went. But what I've learned through my reporting is that winning <strong>Roman Abramovich</strong>'s trust was decades in the making for <strong>Joe Ravitch</strong>, Raine's Russian-speaking co-founder. For starters, he was a Russian literature major and lived in the Soviet Union during his junior year of college, later attending Yale Law School and going on to work as an attorney in Moscow. </p> <p>When Ravitch made the switch to investment banking, he realised that sports deals were the business, and the rest is history. Around 10 years ago he met Abramovich while holidaying on the Caribbean island of St Barths, and the two hit it off. That's an abridged version of the tale, so do read this week's main item for more. We also have a special dispatch from <strong>Michael Pooler</strong>, the FT's Brazil correspondent, who has the lowdown on the rise of sports betting in the South American country.</p> <p>Do read on — <em>Samuel Agini, sports business reporter</em></p> <h1>Why Raine got the Chelsea sale mandate</h1> <p>Joe Ravitch has made a career out of connecting the dots. </p> <p>And it goes a long way to explaining why Raine, the advisory firm the former <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> banker founded in 2009 with ex-<strong>UBS </strong>and <strong>Morgan Stanley </strong>rival <strong>Jeff Sine</strong>, is selling Chelsea on behalf of Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.</p> <p>As <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89dee0d9-b445-4d88-9744-cb7d2338056d\">the FT reports</a>, Ravitch won the billionaire's trust while on holiday in the Caribbean around a decade ago.</p> <p>The meeting was made possible through an old contact from Ravitch's days as an attorney in Moscow in the early 1990s, while working for Boris Yeltsin's Russian Federation, where he met a chartered accountant named <strong>Eugene Tenenbaum</strong>.</p> <p>Ravitch went into banking, working in London, Hong Kong and New York, while Tenenbaum became one of Abramovich's “closest associates”, according to Chelsea's website, and a board member of the club.</p> <p>That meeting got Raine in the door, consulting on commercial strategy and the potential for modernisation and expansion of Chelsea's <strong>Stamford Bridge</strong>, which lags behind the capacity of major rivals. When bidders looked at Chelsea in 2018, Raine <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e76f7d2-a951-11e8-89a1-e5de165fa619\">put a value on the club</a> for Abramovich, who resisted the urge to sell.</p> <p>But Russia's invasion of Ukraine forced his hand. On offer is an elite <strong>English Premier League </strong>side and current holders of the <strong>Uefa Champions League </strong>and <strong>Fifa Club World Cup</strong>.</p> <p>Unique, longstanding bonds of that nature help explain Raine's competitive advantage in dealmaking, particularly in sports, which is a relationship-driven business. </p> <p>For instance, Ravitch has been friends with <strong>Ari Emanuel</strong>, the Hollywood mogul behind entertainment group <strong>Endeavor</strong>, since 1996, while Sine is a longstanding adviser to <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong>, founder of Japanese technology conglomerate <strong>SoftBank</strong>. </p> <p>Both companies have been repeat customers, although it's not uncommon for Raine to appear on the other side of deals, such as when it advised <strong>Ultimate Fighting Championship</strong>, the mixed martial arts series, on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eed0fc18-4760-11e6-b387-64ab0a67014c\">its $4bn sale</a> in 2016. UFC now sits within Endeavor.</p> <p>Abu Dhabi's <strong>Mubadala</strong>, the sovereign fund and an early shareholder in Raine, is also a longstanding partner. <strong>Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan</strong>, who controls Premier League side <strong>Manchester City </strong>and parent <strong>City Football Group</strong>, is on Raine's board. </p> <p>CFG, chaired by <strong>Khaldoon Al Mubarak</strong>, chief executive of Mubadala, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c082178-104b-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a\">turned to Raine</a> for advice on a $500mn investment by US private equity firm <strong>Silver Lake</strong> in 2019, just four years after a similar deal to sell a $400mn stake to <strong>China Media Capital</strong>.</p> <p>So the question for the buyer of Chelsea is what Raine can help with next.</p> <h1>Brazilian bookmakers profit as government draws up regulation</h1> <p>Following the piecemeal liberalisation of online sports betting in the US, bookmakers are eyeing up Brazil as the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2b9475a-ac75-46cb-ad7d-ae483d52954b\">next big frontier</a>, write Michael Pooler and Alice Hancock.</p> <p>The pastime has taken off in popularity since it was legalised in the South American country just over three years ago, tapping into both a national <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/69ef40fc-5b5c-48f9-a6ea-435c0b57e6a5\">obsession with football</a> and an apparent appetite for gambling that for decades had few outlets.</p> <p>Major international groups like<strong> Entain</strong>, <strong>Flutter </strong>and <strong>Bet365</strong> are among operators running 450-odd websites aimed at Brazilian punters. Collectively, digital bookies are already estimated to be generating revenues in the hundreds of millions of dollars. </p> <p>“We're excited about it,” <strong>Flutter </strong>CEO<strong> Peter Jackson </strong>says of the promise of Brazil.</p> <p>You only have to tune into a soccer match to see the reais being poured into marketing. Nineteen of the top division's 20 clubs carry some kind of online betting sponsorship. </p> <p>The rush coincides with a renewed push in Congress to effectively overturn a 1940s ban on games of chance. A bill recently passed in the lower house would allow casinos, bingo halls and slot machines, among other activities. </p> <p>For now though, online sports betting occupies something of a grey area in Brazil. While permitted the government is yet to promulgate any regulation of the sector. This has deterred some foreign operators, wary of the legal uncertainty and costs. </p> <p>Industry executives believe that a clear set of rules for everything from awarding licences to advertising — which officials in the capital Brasília are drawing up to be ready in time for this year's<strong> Fifa World Cup</strong> in Qatar — will act as a catalyst for growth in the sector.</p> <p>Data provider<strong> H2 Gambling Capital </strong>reckons that gross gambling revenue from online sports betting in Brazil reached R$1.98bn ($420mn) last year. Once regulated, it forecasts turnover could rise to R$5.5bn by 2026. &#xa0;</p> <p>The big question is what the regulatory framework will look like. The two broad options are either an authorisation model, with unlimited licences issued to every operator that satisfies the condition; or a concession system, where companies bid over a finite number of permits.</p> <p>“What happens with sports betting may set the tone for what happens with regulation in other gambling verticals,” says lawyer<strong> Neil Montgomery</strong>. “It will be the first test.”</p> <p>However, reform of any kind is rarely straightforward or speedy in Brazil. And with presidential elections in October, don't hold your breath for a golden era of gambling in the country just yet.</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>FC Barcelona </strong>and <strong>Real Madrid </strong>attracted a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/30/barcelona-real-madrid-womens-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report\">record-breaking attendance</a> to their <strong>Women's Champions League </strong>quarter-final, which was watched by over 91,550 fans. The turnout at Barca's<strong> Camp Nou </strong>stadium has been widely heralded as a landmark for women's football.</p></li>  <li><p>Birmingham is shooting for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7aa107d3-f2a5-499b-8381-a13663209301\">£1bn boost</a> from hosting the <strong>Commonwealth Games</strong> this summer, as the West Midlands city seeks to emulate Manchester's efforts in 2002 and London's <strong>2012 Olympics</strong>. At stake is the chance to propel the recovery in the UK's second largest city and former manufacturing powerhouse. </p></li>  <li><p>The <strong>Buffalo Bills</strong>, a team in America's <strong>National Football League</strong>, is set to benefit from <a href=\"https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/nfl-s-bills-to-get-600-million-from-n-y-in-hochul-stadium-deal\">$850mn of taxpayer funding</a> for construction of its new stadium. The deal means that the NFL team will commit to remaining in Buffalo for 30 years.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Formula One</strong>, the global motorsport, <a href=\"https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.breaking-las-vegas-to-host-formula-1-night-race-from-2023.69O9nKLwKraqAhR5rr8TQg.html\">officially confirmed</a> that it will race in Las Vegas from 2023. The night race marks the further expansion into North America by US owners <strong>Liberty Media</strong>, adding to grands prix in Miami, Austin and Montreal.</p></li>  <li><p>How about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2555783-9dee-495d-8672-fb1d9d977864\">virtual sparring</a> with <strong>Sylvester Stallone</strong>'s <strong>Rocky</strong>? In a piece for FT Magazine, San Francisco-based Dave Lee tests the technology bidding to change fitness.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Final Whistle</h1> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HenryBushnell/status/1508895040994689025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/HenryBushnell/status/1508895040994689025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</a> <p>It was hard to tell if <strong>Senegal</strong>'s victory against <strong>Egypt </strong>to secure qualification for the <strong>Fifa World Cup</strong> was a game of football or some kind of laser battle out of <strong>Star Wars</strong>. What's clear is that Egyptian talisman <strong>Mohamed Salah </strong>did well even to run up to the ball, his vision surely impaired by bright green laser beams as he missed a crucial kick in the penalty shootout. The fallout from this one will run and run. </p><p>Source:  2022 'Meet the bankers behind the Chelsea sale' FT.com 2 April.
