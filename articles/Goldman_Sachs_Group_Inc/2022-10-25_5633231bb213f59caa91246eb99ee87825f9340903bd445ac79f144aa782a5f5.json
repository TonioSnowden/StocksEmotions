  "text": "<p>Through the arrangement between the two companies, users of Venmo, which is owned by PayPal PYPL, will be able to add their Venmo accounts to their Amazon profiles and then choose that as their payment method at checkout. They can also opt to make Venmo their default payment option.</p><p>\"The ability to pay with Venmo on Amazon continues our ongoing commitment to offer the community more ways to spend, send, receive, and manage their money with Venmo,\" Doug Bland, the head of PayPal's consumer business, said in a release. He called out Venmo's \"nearly 90 million users.\"</p><p>Venmo has achieved strong popularity — and cemented itself as a verb — by allowing people to send their friends money for free, but PayPal over the years has been looking to generate revenue from the peer-to-peer platform, in part by letting people use the service as a payment mechanism in stores and online. Venmo grew revenue by 50% in the second quarter.</p><p>Chief Executive Dan Schulman spoke positively of the Amazon arrangement at a recent Goldman Sachs conference, saying that Amazon represents roughly 30% of U.S. e-commerce.</p><p>\"Think about the number of merchants that we would have to sign up here in the U.S. to get that same scale for Pay with Venmo,\" he said. \"It would be multiple, multiple millions.\"</p><p>Read: PayPal is 'clearly now at a turning point,' its CEO says</p><p>Amazon rolling out Venmo payment option starting today</p>",
