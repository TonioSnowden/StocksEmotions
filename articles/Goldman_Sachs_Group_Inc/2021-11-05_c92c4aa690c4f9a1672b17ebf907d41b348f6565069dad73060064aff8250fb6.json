  "title": "Oil climbs back from the lowest prices since October, but look to suffer a second-straight weekly loss",
  "text": "<p>Prices were on the rise Friday, but “the move feels more like a car building up velocity after a major speed bump,” said Bjørnar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad Energy, in a daily market note.</p><p>Thursday's price move lower was “exactly that,” he said, as the market decided to reduce risk “at a time that pressure mounts for more OPEC+ output, while Saudi Arabia is reported to soon exceed the 10 million [barrels per day] threshold of oil production.” Thursday's price drop was “sharp and maybe a bit exaggerated too,” he said.</p><p>OPEC+, which is comprised of members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies, “offered no surprises and stuck to its conservative policy, closing the ears to U.S. calls for extra production,” said Tonhaugen. A correction of that price cut, and a price rise was “something to be expected” Friday.</p><p>Read: U.S. oil producers pose 'emerging threat' after OPEC+ defies calls to speed production increases</p><p>West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery&#xa0;CLZ21CL00&#xa0;climbed $1.52, or 1.9%, to $80.33 a barrel. Thursday's action saw crude tumble 2.5% to settle at $78.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, pushing front-month contract prices to the lowest finish since Oct. 7, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>For the week so far, WTI prices are down 3.8%, poised for a second weekly loss in a row, following a nine-week streak of gains — the longest for front-month contracts based on records going back to April 1983, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>January Brent crude&#xa0;BRN00BRNF22,&#xa0;the global benchmark, was up $1.25, or 1.6%, to $81.79 a barrel. Brent tumbled 1.8% on Thursday, its lowest level since Oct. 1. Down 2.4% so far this week, the contract was looking at its worst weekly performance since the week ending Aug. 29.</p><p>At its Thursday meeting, OPEC+ said it would raise the monthly overall production by 400,000 barrels a day in December, a decision that analysts said wasn't a big surprise. Its next meeting will be Dec. 2.</p><p>“OPEC+ carefully tries to protect the market balance and amid the downside risks to demand the alliance is concerned —no wonder they opt to tread carefully,” said Tonhaugen.</p><p>“However, it will not be a surprise if OPEC+ at its next December meeting decides to reengineer its current [output cut] tapering plan to allow for higher target productions for the countries with spare capacity, such as Saudi Arabia, UAE and Russia, to compensate for expected underperformance” from some regions such as West Africa, he said.</p><p>Biden has blamed&#xa0;Russia and OPEC for surging U.S. gasoline prices, calling on the cartel and its allies to pump more oil.</p><p>“The now open disagreement between OPEC and the U.S. administration, the threat of an SPR [Strategic Petroleum Reserve] release and the potential resumption in negotiations with Iran will…increase the volatility in oil prices in coming weeks, especially as trading liquidity falls into year-end,” said a team of analysts at Goldman Sachs led by Damien Courvalin, in a note dated Nov. 4.</p><p>But they said even if the U.S. tapped its emergency oil supplies, such a move would be of “modest and temporary help and could in fact backfire given the structural nature of the oil market deficits starting in 2023.”</p><p>The Goldman analysts told oil bulls to hold their ground, as the the oil market is undersupplied and facing more volatility, at the end of a week that's set to deliver the commodity's worst losses since August.</p><p>“Net,&#xa0;our bullish view remains unchanged: the oil deficit remains unresolved, the current strength in&#xa0;oil demand remains a near-term tailwind&#xa0;and the&#xa0;increasingly structural nature of the deficits will require much higher long-dated oil prices,” the analysts said.</p><p>Couravlin said the analysts' favored bullish oil trade now is a long December 2022 contract, which offers “the best return vs. volatility trade off as perceived near-term bearish risks (COVID, OPEC, Iran, U.S. SPR) would only further delay the required ramp-up in investment and exacerbate the structural deficits that we forecast starting in 2023.” The bank has a $90-a-barrel end-2021 forecast for Brent crude.</p><p>Prices for petroleum products Friday were also on the rise, with December gasoline&#xa0;RBZ21up 1.7% to $2.331 a gallon, looking at a weekly loss of 1.6%, and December heating oil&#xa0;HOZ21up 2% to $2.455 a gallon, trading about 1% lower for the week.</p><p>December natural-gas futures NGZ21 fell 2.2% to $5.592 per million British thermal units, but was holding onto a weekly rise or more than 3%.</p>",
