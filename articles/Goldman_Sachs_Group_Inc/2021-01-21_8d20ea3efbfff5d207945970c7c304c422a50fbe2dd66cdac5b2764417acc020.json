  "title": "Morgan  Stanley's  Profit  Soars  ----  By Peter Rudegeair",
  "text": "<p>    Morgan Stanley said fourth-quarter profit rose 51% from a year earlier, another big U.S. bank to emerge from a turbulent year in better shape than was expected at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. </p><p>   The New York-based firm reported a profit of $3.39 billion, or $1.81 a share. Revenue increased 26% to $13.64 billion. Both beat the consensus estimates of analysts polled by FactSet, who predicted per-share earnings of $1.30 on revenue of $11.58 billion. </p><p>   Morgan Stanley rounded out fourth-quarter earnings reports from the nation's big banks, which continued to benefit from a recovery on Wall Street and federal pandemic-response measures that forestalled the worst-case economic scenario. On Tuesday, rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported a fourth-quarter profit that was more than twice as large as year-earlier results. </p><p>   With its focus on wealthy Americans and big corporations and money managers, Morgan Stanley is less exposed to mass unemployment and small-business closures than more Main Street banks. </p><p>   Stock- and bond-trading revenue at Morgan Stanley leapt 32% to $4.22 billion, a bigger jump than any other bank. Investment-banking fees rose 46% to $2.30 billion mostly due to $1 billion in revenue Morgan Stanley generated for underwriting initial public offerings and other stock offerings. Those fees more than doubled from the fourth quarter of 2019. </p><p>   While the Wall Street businesses started off 2021 strong, Chief Executive James Gorman said that continuing at last year's pace likely isn't sustainable. \"There's a lot of market activity, I think, in the reasonable near term,\" he said. \"Whether it is at the level of 2020, I mean, you'd have to bet against that just on pure odds.\" </p><p>   Among the biggest U.S. banks, Morgan Stanley has been the most active in remaking itself through deals over the past year. Its acquisition of E*Trade Financial Corp., which closed during the fourth quarter, enabled the bank to take advantage of a boom in retail trading. In October, Morgan Stanley said it was purchasing investment manager Eaton Vance Corp. for $7 billion, a deal that is expected to close later this year. </p><p>   Revenue at Morgan Stanley's wealth-management division increased 24% to $5.68 billion in part due to growth at E*Trade. The deal helped raise the number of retail-trading clients at Morgan Stanley to 6.7 million, and average daily retail trades handled by the company for the quarter exceeded 1.1 million. </p><p>   Morgan Stanley is betting that it can complement retail-trading offerings for E*Trade users with a broader array of wealth-management services. E*Trade users are, on average, more than 10 years younger than Morgan Stanley's traditional clients. </p><p></p>",
