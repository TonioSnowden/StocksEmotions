Covid-19 measures, which have confined tens of millions of people temporarily to their homes, led to broad economic consequences. The Chinese yuan also dropped to its weakest level against the U.S. dollar in two years recently.</p><p>A downturn in the country's real-estate market, weak demand and cost pressures reduced profits in the iron and steel industry by 80.8% in the first seven months of 2022 from the same period last year, the statistics bureau said.</p><p>Profits earned by China's auto makers reported the steepest increase among all the surveyed industries due to factors including supply-chain recovery and a tax cut on vehicle purchases, the bureau said. Profit increased 77.8% on year in July, up 30.1 percentage points from June, it said.</p><p>Industrial profit of state-owned enterprises rose 8% for the January-to-July period from the same period last year, according to the bureau.
