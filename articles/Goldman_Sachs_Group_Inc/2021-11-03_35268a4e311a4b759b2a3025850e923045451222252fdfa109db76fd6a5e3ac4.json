  "title": "New Jersey Governor Race Is Still Too Close to Call; Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy takes lead over GOP challenger Jack Ciattarelli",
  "text": "<p>The race centered largely on taxes. Mr. Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, has criticized Mr. Murphy's fiscal policies and promised to cut state spending. Mr. Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive who was first elected in 2017, raised taxes on millionaires and expanded educational programs.</p><p>Mr. Murphy campaigned on his record in office, touting the legalization of marijuana and increases to the state's minimum wage during his tenure. He said he provided stable management during the Covid-19 pandemic, and Monmouth polls showed his job approval rating remained above 50% since the virus arrived in March 2020.</p><p>Mr. Ciattarelli has criticized Mr. Murphy's requirement that school students wear masks while in the classroom and faulted the governor for a policy early in the pandemic that allowed nursing homes to accept Covid-19 patients from hospitals. Mr. Murphy said the masking policy is needed to keep children safe and called the coronavirus nursing home deaths a tragedy.</p><p>Speaking to supporters just after midnight, Mr. Murphy said, \"We're going to wait for every vote to be counted, and that's how our democracy works.\"</p><p>Mr. Ciattarelli said he would \"do what needs to be done to certify this win.\"</p><p>No Democrat has won re-election as governor of New Jersey since 1977.</p><p>In recent weeks, both President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris appeared with Mr. Murphy in the state. Three nonpartisan surveys released in the past week showed Mr. Murphy leading by roughly 10 points over Mr. Ciattarelli.</p><p>Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than one million in the Garden State, according to the New Jersey secretary of state's office. That is up from a Democratic advantage of around 700,000 voters in 2009, when Republican Chris Christie defeated Jon Corzine's bid for a second term.</p><p>Ben Dworkin, director of the Rowan University Institute for Public Policy and Citizenship, said the election was Mr. Murphy's to lose.</p><p>\"There's a drag from Joe Biden's low approval ratings. And the craziness that's gone on in Washington has depressed Democratic enthusiasm and energized Republicans,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Jimmy Vielkind at Jimmy.Vielkind@wsj.com</p><p>New Jersey Governor Race Is Still Too Close to Call</p>",
