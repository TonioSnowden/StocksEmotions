When <strong>Serena Williams</strong> announced her intent to step away from tennis after this year's tournament, the sport wasn't sure what to expect of the 23-time Grand Slam champion — who largely hasn't competed in a year leading up to this swan song. The atmosphere at Arthur Ashe Stadium pivoted from reverent on Monday to electric by late Wednesday, when the 40-year old upset world no. 2 Anett Kontaveit. But on Friday night the fairytale ended, with Williams <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4119c4f2-6ebf-4503-9699-5b41a4a28bb6\">knocked out</a> by Ajla Tomljanović. “It's been a fun ride”, a tearful Williams told the adoring crowd.</p> <p>It's no wonder Williams is this week's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48f49626-f2a8-4e39-a3f3-e44c2a1d6f39?\">FT Person in the News</a>, for her one-of-a-kind legacy not only in the sport but across business, motherhood, and fashion. Stay tuned for more updates from the Open next week, but first we have a digest on another New York story — the <strong>Yankees</strong> taking a stake in <strong>AC Milan</strong> — and we look beyond the big spenders in the football transfer window to those coining it from selling. Do read on —<em> Sara Germano, US sport business correspondent</em></p> <h1>Start spreading the news: the Bronx Bombers back AC Milan</h1> <p>This week <strong>RedBird Capital</strong> closed on its €1.2bn acquisition of AC Milan, placing the American investment group in control of the Serie A champions.</p> <p>In doing so, founder <strong>Gerry Cardinale</strong> brought in some <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/146cc390-3060-45cd-a986-e09e7e6c67cb\">longtime associates</a> as minority shareholders, none other than the <strong>New York Yankees</strong> and a Los Angeles-based investment fund backed by <strong>LeBron James</strong> and the rapper <strong>Drake</strong>.</p> <p>Cardinale, the former Goldman Sachs banker, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/15c9f437-8eb9-4d83-85ec-af36079243b8\">seeking to leverage</a> his longtime relationships with celebrity athletes and the Yankees in particular to guide his vision for the <em>Rossoneri</em>. During his time at the investment bank, Cardinale helped start the Major League Baseball team's regional sports channel, the YES Network, starting a two-decade relationship with the owning <strong>Steinbrenner</strong> family.</p> <p>Their closeness informed the Yankees organisation's decision to take a minority interest in AC Milan, according to people familiar with the matter. But the view from New York, where the 27-time World Series champions remain one of the most valuable clubs in sport ($6bn as estimated by Forbes), is that Milan are still a niche interest that can benefit from the halo of the Bronx Bombers' brand.</p> <p>“No one really knows them here”, said one person familiar with the investment. While the Yankees organisation will be limited partners without strategic input in Milan, they plan to help promote the Italian champions by broadcasting match reruns on YES and inviting the <em>Rossoneri </em>to play friendlies at Yankee Stadium.</p> <p>Cardinale and RedBird are still seeking limited partners to help pay down the €600mn loan from Elliott Management, the previous stewards of AC Milan, to purchase the club. <strong>Main Street Advisors</strong>, a Los Angeles-based investment group which counts James and Drake as well as <strong>Maverick Carter</strong> and <strong>Jimmy Iovine</strong> as backers, joined the minority stakeholders at the close of the deal this week.</p> <p>While the athletic and entertainment glitterati aren't direct investors in Milan, Cardinale has shown his ability to follow through on working his existing connections to back his vision. The greater question will be if he can win over Italians. </p> <h1>How the Premier League funds Europe</h1> <p>When <strong>Antony Santos</strong> announced his arrival at <strong>Manchester United</strong> this week, he thanked his family, his friends and the legion of United fans who messaged him on social media. “It was your call that brought me here!!” he said. </p> <p>Little mention, however, of the €95mn required to prise the Brazilian winger away from <strong>Ajax</strong>, a figure the player's own coach described as “absurd”. The Dutch champions generated almost €225mn from player sales this summer, the highest in Europe. The bulk of that came from Man United, who also forked out nearly €60mn for Antony's teammate <strong>Lisandro Martinez</strong>. </p> <p>These deals highlight the ever increasing financial muscle of English football. The Dutch champions can offer Champions League football this season, something Antony won't get in Manchester. And while United has a rich history in the competition, Ajax has been crowned champions of Europe four times; that's once more than the English side.</p> <p>But this summer was no one-off event. Ajax has been producing top talent and selling it for big fees for years as one of Europe's pre-eminent football factories supplying top clubs in England, Spain, Germany and Italy. In the past decade the Amsterdam club's player sales have generated €900mn, according to Transfermarkt, yielding a positive balance of €480mn. </p> <p>Ajax is not alone. Portuguese clubs <strong>Benfica</strong>, <strong>Sporting</strong> <strong>Clube de Portugal</strong> and <strong>Porto</strong> have similar stories to tell, as do <strong>Lyon</strong> and<strong> Lille</strong> in France. Benfica tops the lot, with €1.2bn of sales in the past 10 years, with an annual surplus from players of around €66mn. </p> <p>All these clubs have built a system of identifying talent, often from South America, developing players at their elite finishing schools, and then showcasing them — typically in Champions League matches against would-be buyers. Wealthy Premier League teams and their top European rivals then swoop in, paying high fees backed by bumper TV revenue. </p> <p>This successful production line model is gaining attention from investors looking to build a multi-club football business, like <strong>John Textor</strong>. He's already the biggest shareholder in Premier League side <strong>Crystal Palace</strong>, and owner of <strong>Botafogo</strong> in Brazil and <strong>RWD Molenbeek</strong> in Belgium. He recently agreed a deal to buy Lyon, one of Europe's top talent-producing centres, and has previously been linked with investments in Portugal. </p> <p>For all their decades of history, a number of European clubs now thrive on being production hubs for the all-consuming Premier League. With transfer spending by England's top clubs approaching £2bn this summer, there are growing opportunities to make money in football beyond TV deals. </p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Dana White</strong> is the face of <strong>Ultimate Fighting Championship</strong>, the mixed martial arts series owned by entertainment group <strong>Endeavor</strong>.
