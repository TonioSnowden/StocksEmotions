  "text": "<p>Do you remember when $100bn was a lot of money? Twenty years ago, at the height of the dotcom bubble, that was how much was poured into venture capital investments in a single year. It was five times the amount seen two years before, and five times as much as two years later.</p> <p>It turned out that much cash could not be forced into start-ups without a business model, and most of the money was lost. Another $42bn went into tech initial public offerings. Many of these were from revenue-less companies that would not have had a hope of making it to the public markets in normal times.</p> <p>Compare that with what has now become a series of bubbles in and around the tech industry. These have found different forms in the likes of IPOs, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e846c8f6-6ff0-4e2f-a95f-f32043558315\">initial coin offerings</a>, Bitcoin and Tesla. But it is not hard to find the common denominators: The hunt for growth in an investment world awash with cash, and the kind of fear of missing out — or “fomo” — that takes hold at such times.</p> <p>One clear echo of the dotcom bubble has come from the rise of the special purpose acquisition companies, or <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80458983-1693-4022-ba23-113925d24d70\">Spacs</a>. The companies raise funds and then go in search of acquisitions. As in the dotcom era, much of the Spac money is finding its way into early-stage ventures, making this the first time since the start of the century that a channel has opened up to take a larger number of revenue-less companies to the public markets. “Auto-tech” start-ups are a particular favourite.</p> <p>Nikola, which came to market after an acquisition by a Spac, has been the starkest example. The hydrogen-powered truck company had losses of $117m in the latest quarter and no revenues. Yet it rose to a market value of $25bn in the middle of last year. And despite the resignation of its chief executive and General Motors' decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2760f09d-9929-4523-bcc0-ca5b7052fa6c\">scrap</a> a planned $2bn partnership with the company, it is still valued at more than $6bn.</p> <p>The race to raise cash last year has left Spacs with $70bn of firepower, according to Goldman Sachs. Given the way they structure their deals, that equates to future acquisitions worth $300bn. If the deals are not all crammed into the next two years, then that money has to be handed back to investors, creating classic incentives for a bubble.</p> <p>There are other parallels with the dotcom period. In promising new tech markets, it is common for a winner-take-all mentality to take hold, points out Charles Giancarlo, a veteran Silicon Valley executive. Investors fail to imagine how competition will develop. The cloud software industry — where companies like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/170649d0-4cdf-454b-a4ec-e28d130974cd\">Zoom</a> have thrived — is full of supposed “category killers”, companies with a specialised service expected to dominate a global niche. The index of “emerging” <a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/bvp-nasdaq-emerging-cloud-index\">cloud software companies</a> on Nasdaq has risen around 150 per cent from its low point at the start of the pandemic, valuing the companies at $1.8tn.</p> <p>Behind all this is the sheer weight of money looking for a home. The public markets offer few growth opportunities. The traditional venture capital industry cannot handle the weight of money, leading to a rash of experimentation in recent years. This included sales of digital tokens, or ICOs, made by cryptocurrency projects. These crowd-fundings by classic revenue-less software start-ups pulled in $20bn.</p> <p>IPO investors have also made a belated bid to join the party. Going public fell out of fashion for an entire generation of tech start-ups. But the initial share price spikes at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9f8f03f-6b82-4828-84e2-7ac25966b7d1\">DoorDash </a>and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1c5cc26-b224-470a-84fe-8a6575fd33dc\">Airbnb </a>last month show that the IPO speculators are back out in force.</p> <p>To avoid the mania, gaming company Roblox has just <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff4c8173-1c8b-4ea2-8c58-ee753d620313?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">scrapped its IPO</a> for a quieter backdoor route to the market through a direct listing. But it still raised some extra cash in a deal that valued it at $29.5bn, or seven times what it was judged to be worth in a fundraising less than a year ago.</p> <p>Much like squeezing a balloon full of water, the excess cash in the system is causing bulges that are becoming impossible to suppress. Consider two that have transfixed speculators.</p> <p>The market value of all outstanding bitcoin has risen $580bn since the start of last year, hitting a new record this week of more than $700bn. That closely matches the trajectory of Tesla: the electric car maker has added $670bn in market cap in the same period, and is now valued at $750bn.</p> <p>Tesla may one day dominate a global electric car market, and bitcoin may become a permanent fixture in the world of digital money. But as each soars towards $1tn, they look like the clearest examples of the pandemic era's spreading financial bubbles.</p> <p><em>richard.waters@ft.com</em></p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/ff96b3cb-4ae3-40b8-891a-6c3af773c124.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Richard Waters 2021 'Pandemic tech bubbles echo those of the dotcom era' FT.com 7 January.
