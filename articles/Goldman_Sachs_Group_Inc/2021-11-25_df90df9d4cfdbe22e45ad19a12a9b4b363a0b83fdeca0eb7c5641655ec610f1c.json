  "text": "<h2>Nordea: going viral</h2> <p>“Leaving aside the lessons from the Nuremberg trials such as bodily integrity, informed choice, the impact on civil liberties, and so on (because who cares?), lockdown policies, vaccine mandates and so on do carry costs,” write Nordea analysts Martin Enlund and Andreas Steno Larsen in the Helsinki-based bank's weekly note entitled: “Papers please, and how to trade them!”</p> <p>Larsen, Nordea's global chief strategist, and chief foreign exchange strategist Enlund have a reputation for tendentious views on how Covid will affect markets. Their previous notes have based trading calls around the Biden administration's “scapegoating” of the unvaccinated, referred <a href=\"https://corporate.nordea.com/article/64134/preliminary-prepayments\">to Australia</a> as “the former(?) prison colony” and fretted about European politicians being swayed by “<a href=\"https://corporate.nordea.com/article/67682/fx-weekly-don-t-rule-out-new-lock-downs-in-europe-this-autumn-winter\">loud lockdownistas</a>”. </p> <p>This month they lent further into the theme, citing preprint academic research to question the efficacy of booster shots and rail against quarantines of the unvaccinated “<em>Untermensch</em>”. The latest update, published on Sunday, soon attracted the attention of social media. A “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KarnaMikko/status/1463496223919415304\">shocked</a>” Mikko Karna, Finnish member of parliament for the Lapland constituency, tweeted to ask Nordea if it had hired Facebook conspiracy theorists to write its official newsletters.</p> <p>In response, Nordea removed the team's last two notes from its website. Nordea said it had “started an internal review into the contents of the analysis” and declined to comment on whether Larsen and Enlund were still working at the bank.</p> <h2>Dan Horsky: late-stage capitalism</h2> <p>It keeps getting weirder at ADVFN, the data hub for retail investors. A regulatory filing this week revealed that Dan Horsky, a retired New York professor of business administration and convicted tax evader, has been holding nearly 10 per cent of the company for the past nine years. </p> <p>Also on the register of the Aim-listed company are Yair Tauman, an academic and former non-executive director of ADVFN, who in 2015 backed a failed boardroom coup. He doubled his stake to 18.3 per cent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7696083c-fea9-44c2-aa33-9e4cdd6f177d\">this year</a>. Real estate developer Ron Izaki has been a major shareholder since 2009 and owns 4.3 per cent. </p> <p>All three men had previously invested in QXL Ricardo, the London-listed online auctioneer. Naspers of South Africa bought QXL in 2008 for nearly £1bn. Three years earlier, when QXL was valued at approximately £100m, Izaki and Tauman led a consortium that repelled competing attempts by a management-backed vehicle and a private equity fund to take the company private.</p> <p>Horsky was an early backer of QXL's parent company and <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-university-business-professor-sentenced-prison-hiding-over-220-million-offshore-banks\">according to the US Department of Justice</a> it was his only big success among myriad failures. In 2000, he stashed a $500,000 stake offshore in a Credit Suisse bank account that by the time of Naspers' takeover was valued at $80m. Horsky then turned informant, co-operating with a DOJ investigation into Credit Suisse's Israel desk. In 2016, he pleaded guilty to tax fraud and was subsequently&#xa0;sentenced to seven months in prison. </p> <p>A person familiar with ADVFN had no explanation as to why it had taken Horsky nine years to report his investment. Horsky, Izaki and Tauman could not be reached for comment. </p> <h2>Crystelle Pereira: bike off</h2> <p>A popular City zeitgeist measure is Bloomberg's MVP function, which shows the most viewed personal profiles on the terminal. As well as giving a snapshot of newsmakers, the list is an early alert to which names are circulating round private chat groups. </p> <p>This week there was a clear winner: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-23/goldman-analyst-turned-bake-off-star-finds-city-of-london-fame\">Crystelle Pereira</a>, a Goldman Sachs insurance analyst and finalist in The <a href=\"https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/\">Great British Bake Off</a>. By Thursday afternoon, a day after her raw focaccia showstopper was revealed to TV viewers, the 26-year-old had racked up nearly twice as many hits globally as second-placed Thomas Barry, a London equities trader who is switching from Citigroup to BNP Paribas.</p> <p>But Pereira was not Goldman's only newfound celebrity. David Wilkins, the bank's managing director in charge of fixed income currencies and commodities execution services, was said to be proud to have <a href=\"https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/cyclist-recovers-three-stolen-bikes-just-hours-after-theft-thanks-to-airtag-we-heard-beep-beep-beep-from-the-other-side-of-the-window\">made the pages of <em>Cycling Weekly</em></a> this week after turning vigilante to recover three stolen bikes.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Nordea opens investigation after pulling conspiracy-tinged research ' FT.com 25 November.
