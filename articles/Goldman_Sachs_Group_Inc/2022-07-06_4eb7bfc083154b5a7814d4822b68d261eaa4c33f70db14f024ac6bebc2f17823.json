  "title": "BNY Mellon Names Goldman Sachs Veteran as Its Next Finance Chief; Dermot McDonogh will take over as CFO of the New York custody bank on Feb. 1, succeeding Emily Portney",
  "text": "<p>Mr. McDonogh, who is set to join BNY Mellon on Nov. 1, will take the reins as CFO on Feb. 1, 2023. He has worked at Goldman Sachs for over 25 years, including most recently as chief operating officer for the Europe, Middle East and Africa region and chief executive of the company's international bank. Before that, Mr. McDonogh served as Goldman's international controller.</p><p>BNY Mellon in March named former Goldman executive Robin Vince as its next chief executive officer, succeeding Todd Gibbons, who plans to step down on Aug. 31 after about three years in the role. Mr. Vince, who is currently serving as president and CEO-elect, retired from Goldman in 2019 as the bank's chief risk officer.</p><p>Ms. Portney, who has served as BNY Mellon's CFO for two years, is set to take on a new role leading the bank's treasury and credit services, as well as its clearance and collateral management businesses. She will continue to report to the company's CEO and will remain on the executive committee. Ms. Portney previously worked in the bank's asset servicing business, where she led the Americas division, as well as the business's client management, sales and service teams globally.</p><p>Mr. McDonogh will step into the CFO role as the bank confronts new challenges. The Securities and Exchange Commission in May fined BNY Mellon's investment management arm $1.5 million for misleading claims it made about funds that use environmental, social and governance criteria to pick stocks. The bank neither admitted to nor denied the claims.</p><p>The bank in March ceased new banking business in Russia and suspended purchases of Russian securities due to the country's war in Ukraine. BNY Mellon during the first quarter took an $88 million hit to revenue stemming from those moves. It earned $699 million during the quarter, down 19% from a year earlier.</p><p>Recent declines in the stock market have put pressure on the fee revenue that the bank generates from its clients, many of whom are asset managers, said Mike Brown, managing director at investment firm Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. Competitors are facing similar challenges, he said.</p><p>As CFO, Mr. McDonogh will be responsible for BNY Mellon's global financial strategy and operations, including the company's finance function, controllership, treasury, chief investment office and capital management divisions.</p><p>Mr. Vince praised Mr. McDonogh's finance skills and his experience leading global teams in a press release. Mr. McDonogh wasn't available for an interview on Wednesday, a BNY Mellon spokesman said.</p><p>Mr. McDonogh is set to receive an annual base salary of $600,000 as well as a minimum incentive award of $5 million, made up of 30% cash, 30% restricted stock and the remainder in performance share units, BNY Mellon said in a filing with securities regulators. He will also be eligible for buyout awards worth a maximum of $16.5 million, made up of a mix of cash and restricted stock, the filing said.</p><p>Write to Kristin Broughton at Kristin.Broughton@wsj.com</p><p>BNY Mellon Names Goldman Sachs Veteran as Its Next Finance Chief</p>",
