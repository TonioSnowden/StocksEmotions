  "title": "Conagra CEO Says Omicron Will Stress Food Supply Chains; Food maker says more of its employees testing positive for Covid-19; quarterly profits fall as costs mount",
  "text": "<p>\"We've had windows where it gets worse and we've had windows where it gets better,\" said Conagra Chief Executive Sean Connolly, referring to Covid-19 cases, in an interview Thursday. \"And there's been some uptick there in positive cases.\"</p><p>Businesses across the U.S. economy are grappling with the rapidly spreading Omicron variant while consumer demand for products and services has surged and many companies already are struggling with labor and supply-chain challenges.</p><p>Mr. Connolly said ongoing challenges at all stages of Conagra's operations—from purchasing ingredients and packaging to manufacturing food to shipping it to customers—mean the company's service levels still are worse than before the pandemic. Labor and supply-chain problems faced by big food makers have contributed to supermarket shortages two years into the pandemic, with consumers at times still unable to find everything they want in stores.</p><p>\"It's entirely reasonable for all of us to project that the next month or so could remain strained within the supply chain as Omicron runs its course,\" said Mr. Connolly during a conference call.</p><p>Mr. Connolly said several factors have converged to create a \"persistently challenging operating environment,\" including heightened demand, a drawn-out pandemic, a strained supply chain and acute inflation.</p><p>\"The word of the year this year is perseverance,\" said Mr. Connolly, adding that he believes some challenges the company faces will subside as its fiscal year progresses.</p><p>JP Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said in a note this week that some food company executives have warned that a spike in Covid-19 could hurt their ability to supply products to customers in January. Executives' concerns ranged from a shortage of trucks to worries about the deteriorating quality of raw materials arriving from suppliers.</p><p>\"The entire food-at-home supply chain is being impaired by deeper labor shortages than anticipated—this much seems clear to us—and it's only a question of how bad the impact is,\" Mr. Goldman said.</p><p>Conagra said Thursday that net income for the quarter ended Nov. 28 fell 27% to $275.5 million, with sales rising 2.1% to $3.06 billion. Adjusted earnings came in below the expectations of analysts surveyed by FactSet, while sales were higher than anticipated.</p><p>During its latest quarter, Conagra said it incurred higher-than-expected inventory write-offs tied to raw materials or finished goods that didn't meet the company's standards.</p><p>\"We're moving fast to meet demand as are our suppliers,\" said David Marberger, Conagra's chief financial officer, adding that food safety and quality standards are the company's highest priority.</p><p>Conagra also spent more to get as much food delivered as possible, particularly during the holiday season. Costs included increased overtime as well as increased use of third-party transportation and warehousing vendors for frozen products.</p><p>Conagra said it expects some supply-chain costs, such as increased overtime and inventory write-offs, to be short term. Mr. Connelly also said he's heartened by medical experts' guidance that the latest wave of Covid-19 infections could be short-lived. He said Conagra is working to keep employees as safe as possible, including by strongly encouraging them to be vaccinated and receive booster shots.</p><p>The company also said it expects inflation to be worse than originally anticipated, due largely to higher estimated costs for proteins, transportation, dairy and resin. The company said Thursday it expects gross inflation, or input cost inflation before the effects of hedging, to be about 14% for fiscal 2022, compared with its prior outlook of 11%.</p><p>Conagra said it plans to continue raising prices and cutting costs to protect its profit margins, which it expects to improve in the second half of the fiscal year. Prices for the company's products in the second quarter already were up between 3% and 10% compared with the same period a year prior, according to the company.</p><p>Executives said they informed customers of the latest round of price increases in December.</p><p>\"The pricing has been announced, it's been accepted,\" said Mr. Marberger.</p><p>Write to Jesse Newman at jesse.newman@wsj.com</p><p>Conagra CEO Says Omicron Will Stress Food Supply Chains</p>",
