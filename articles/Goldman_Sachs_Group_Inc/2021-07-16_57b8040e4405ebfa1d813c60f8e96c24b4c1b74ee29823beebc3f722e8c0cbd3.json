  "text": "<p>Manchester City's parent company has raised $650m in one of football's biggest ever debt deals as it seeks to step up investment in its international network of football clubs.</p> <p>City Football Group, the Abu Dhabi-controlled holding company that owns the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e4a3899-e233-46a5-8bfe-2131119eca08\">English Premier League champions</a> alongside clubs in the US, Australia and India, recently raised the loan, which will come due in July 2028, according to multiple people familiar with the transaction.</p> <p>The debt deal beats the €525m debt refinancing arrangement between Goldman Sachs and Spain's FC Barcelona agreed in June, and is roughly the level of England's Tottenham Hotspur, which borrowed £637m in 2019 from a number of banks to build its new stadium.</p> <p>CFG intends to use the money to fund infrastructure projects such as a new stadium for its Major League Soccer franchise New York City FC, which has been mooted for years but still requires approval from local authorities.</p> <p>But the group has shown an appetite for rapid growth, having either taken full ownership or bought minority shares in 10 clubs around the world over the past decade. </p> <p>The seven-year loan was underwritten by Barclays, with HSBC and KKR Capital Markets helping arrange and distribute the debt, according to people familiar with the deal. </p> <p>Separately, CFG has also organised a revolving credit facility worth £100m with the same finance providers, though a person close to the group said it had no immediate intention to draw down on the facility.</p> <p>CFG declined to comment. People close to the deal said its executives had opted for raising debt, believing it to be a cheaper route to cash than selling more equity.</p> <p>CFG <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c082178-104b-11ea-a7e6-62bf4f9e548a\">sold a 10 per cent stake</a> to US-based private equity firm Silver Lake Partners for $500m two years ago, which valued the group at $4.8bn — then a record valuation for a sports group. A further 12 per cent is owned by China Media Capital, a venture capital group.</p> <p>The majority owner is Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a billionaire member of the Abu Dhabi ruling family, who bought Manchester City in 2008. </p> <p>He has spent an estimated £1bn on transforming the club from an also-ran into one of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1961ea2-d6c5-11e7-a303-9060cb1e5f44\">most successful sides</a> in English football. </p> <p>Critics have suggested such spending has skewed competition in England and Europe, while human rights activists say it is part of a “sportswashing” project designed to clean up the global image of the United Arab Emirates. Sheikh Mansour's brother is Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the Gulf nation's de facto ruler. </p> <p>The new debt deal ties the group closely to western financial institutions. A year after Silver Lake's investment in CFG, it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0428814e-757a-40aa-af95-fb778a3eaffb\">secured $2bn</a> from Mubadala, Abu Dhabi's sovereign wealth fund which is run by Khaldoon al-Mubarak, who is also Manchester City chair.</p> <p>The money will help prop up the lossmaking group whose finances have been hit hard in the pandemic. </p> <p>CFG's annual revenue dropped to £544m in the financial year ended June 2020, down almost 14 per cent year on year because of lost ticket and broadcast revenue. The group's annual net loss widened to £205m from £84m a season earlier.</p> <p>Manchester City's revenue fell to £478m in the 2019-2020 season, down from £535m the year before. The club swung to a net loss of £126m from a net profit of £10m. It had previously been the only profitmaking club within CFG's global network.</p><p>Source: Samuel Agini, Murad Ahmed, Robert Smith and Stephen Morris 2021 'Manchester City owner raises $650m in one of football's biggest debt deals ' FT.com 16 July.
