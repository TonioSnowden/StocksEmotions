  "text": "<p>SoftBank said on Friday that Katsunori Sago, its chief strategy officer who was viewed as a potential successor to founder Masayoshi Son, will resign after less than three years at the technology conglomerate.</p> <p>The departure of Sago, a top banker who was once tipped as a possible president of Goldman Sachs Japan before he joined SoftBank, is the latest in a string of high-profile exits at a company whose strategy investors said has become increasingly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4403ee1a-050f-4742-b967-ba47b0f1de03\">difficult to define</a>.</p> <p>His exit marks the second time that a high-profile executive has quit after being recruited as potential heir to Son, following <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/547f9e86-37a1-11e6-a780-b48ed7b6126f\">the 2016 departure</a> of former Google executive Nikesh Arora. It comes as Son, who is 63, has recently said that he plans to stay as the leader of the group beyond the age of 70. </p> <p>The loss of Sago adds to a succession of high-level management departures over the past 12 months, including by the company's chief compliance officer, chief legal officer and chief communications officer. The executive positions were meant to act as guardrails within SoftBank to Son's unruly style of managing the company. </p> <p>“As CSO, [Sago] played a crucial part in expanding SBG's potential as an investment company,” Son said in a statement. “We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for his contributions and achievements.”</p> <p>SoftBank said Sago had asked to resign but it declined to comment on why he was leaving and where he was heading next. The company has yet to find a successor for his role. His exit comes as SoftBank's share price recently surpassed the all-time high it reached just before the dotcom bubble burst in 2000.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sago left Goldman Sachs in 2015 to manage the $1.9tn investment portfolio of Japan Post Bank — a high-profile position in which he was expected to stay for many years. His sudden departure for SoftBank, said people close to Sago at the time, came with an implicit promise that by making the move, he stood a good chance of one day becoming Son's successor.</p> <p>Upon joining SoftBank in June 2018, Sago appeared to make a swift impact: he convinced almost a dozen of his former Goldman Sachs colleagues in Tokyo to join him at SoftBank. By importing a significant team of Goldman bankers, Sago appeared on track to create an internal counterweight to the group of former Deutsche Bank traders who had been brought in by the London-based head of the $100bn Vision Fund, Rajeev Misra.</p> <p>Sago's exact role at SoftBank remained unclear but people close to the company said his team was brought in to rein in the group's bloated balance sheet. His lieutenants also ran a unit that focused on offering Vision Fund companies cheaper financing options to purchase assets such as property and cars using SoftBank's credit and equity. </p> <p>But over the past 18 months, said people familiar with the situation, Sago and his team have found themselves underused in a company that has shifted from an operator of assets to a global technology investor.&#xa0;</p> <p>“It is not a surprise for me,” said one person close to Sago. “He does not have much to do — he had been doing nothing for the last 18 months. He is good so he wasn't losing money but he was watching people in the company losing money and he started looking for other positions elsewhere. He knew that he wasn't going to become Son's successor.”</p> <p>SoftBank's Vision Fund has recorded its best performance in the final three months of 2020 in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f78abc14-abd0-427d-9e44-e5e593104432\">dramatic turnround</a> following the failure of some of its high-profile bets including US property group WeWork. But the rebound follows a turbulent year during which it carried out a huge restructuring of assets alongside aggressive purchases of US equity derivatives using its new cash pile.</p> <p>In recent months, Michael Ronen, another former Goldman Sachs banker and a top US executive at the Vision Fund, left the group after expressing concerns about “issues”. Last year, Chad Fentress, the group's chief compliance officer, resigned due to concerns about its governance measures.&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Kana Inagaki and Leo Lewis in Tokyo, Arash Massoudi in London  2021 'SoftBank's strategy chief leaves after three years' FT.com 5 March.
