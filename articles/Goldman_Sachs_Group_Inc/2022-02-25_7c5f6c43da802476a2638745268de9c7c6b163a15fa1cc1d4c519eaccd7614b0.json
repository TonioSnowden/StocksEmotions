  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs has disclosed that US regulators are looking into whether its bankers improperly used personal messaging apps to do business, making it the latest bank to be caught up in a wider probe of Wall Street record-keeping.</p> <p>Goldman said in its annual report on Friday that it was co-operating with the Securities and Exchange Commission and “producing documents in connection with an investigation of the firm's compliance with records preservation requirements relating to business communications sent over electronic messaging channels that have not been approved by the firm”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The disclosure comes after JPMorgan Chase was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3d39492-64a5-444e-9db6-d11537191664\">fined</a> a record $200mn in December by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the US derivatives regulator, for failing to keep records of staff communications on personal devices.</p> <p>Following JPMorgan's fine, the SEC said it was also investigating additional record-keeping issues at other financial firms.</p> <p>HSBC said earlier this week that the CFTC was investigating “the use of non-HSBC approved messaging platforms for business communications”.</p> <p>The fine for JPMorgan was a warning to banks across Wall Street to tighten up controls and document preservation among employees, which has become more complicated during the pandemic as more work has been done away from the office.</p> <p>For instance, Credit Suisse last year asked its employees to let the bank access their personal mobile phones and other devices if they used them to communicate with clients or colleagues, the Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70680daf-41b4-496a-8cb2-f14bb28534dd\">reported</a>.</p> <p>In its annual report, Goldman made no mention of requests for information from authorities over block trading. Rival Morgan Stanley on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d14c8bf-d6fd-4cb0-b654-9dfdc4254bc1\">disclosed</a> that the US securities regulator had been examining its block trading business, a way to sell bulk volumes of stock, since 2019 and that the Department of Justice recently joined with its own investigation.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2022 'Goldman Sachs discloses probe into record-keeping practices' FT.com 25 February.
