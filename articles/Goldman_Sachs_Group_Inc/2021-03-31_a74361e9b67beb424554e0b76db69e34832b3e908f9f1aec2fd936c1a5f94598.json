  "text": "<p>PwC has told its accountants and consultants in the UK that they will spend an average of two to three days a week in the office after the pandemic ends and has promised them a half day on Fridays this summer. </p> <p>The consultancy is the first Big Four firm to set out its longer term working arrangements as the UK prepares to further ease its pandemic-related restrictions.</p> <p>It told staff on Tuesday that they will typically spend 40 to 60 per cent of their time at its 20 UK offices or at client sites, with the rest of the week spent working remotely. </p> <p>Employees will also be given greater flexibility to decide their working hours and to log on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f037991e-4481-4641-8186-0862f1f07c97\">at times that suit them best</a>, in a move away from the traditional nine-to-five work day. </p> <p>The changes come as financial and professional services firms grapple with the lasting impact of the pandemic on their working models.</p> <p>Nationwide last week told 13,000 of its office-based staff that they would be allowed to work from wherever they liked after 57 per cent of employees told the building society they did not want to return to the office after lockdown ends.</p> <p>Meanwhile, David Solomon, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, has labelled working from home <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7c8ce81-8e81-4d67-8104-4f6b3174958a\">an “aberration”</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f037991e-4481-4641-8186-0862f1f07c97\">PwC</a> has opted for a middle course, attempting to retain the benefits of offices for training and collaboration without discouraging staff who value the flexibility of remote working. </p> <p>The firm's plans, which it has branded internally as “the Deal”, follow a consultation with staff. </p> <p>Kevin Ellis, chair and senior partner at PwC UK, said: “We've long promoted flexible working, and we hope today's announcements make it much more the norm rather than the exception. </p> <p>“The future of work is changing at such a pace we have to evolve continually how we do things to meet the needs of our people and our clients.”</p> <p>Most PwC employees will be given a half day on Fridays in July and August this year. This could become an annual policy if it is a success this summer, a spokesman said. </p> <p>PwC's Big Four rivals have not yet spelt out their plans for post-pandemic working patterns but leaders at the firms have indicated that offices will continue to play an important role.</p> <p>KPMG last month said it would spend £44m on technology and refitting its offices to increase the amount of space for staff meetings. </p> <p>Last year, Deloitte offered about 500 staff the option of working from home full time as it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e82aa9e-a982-4e7d-889b-e4bb4d24bb1c\">abandoned offices in Gatwick, Liverpool, Nottingham and Southampton</a>. </p><p>Source: Michael O'Dwyer 2021 'PwC tells staff to split office and homeworking after Covid' FT.com 31 March.
