  "title": "U.S. News:  New York Subway Victim Embraced City Life  ----  By Matt Wirz",
  "text": "<p>    Daniel Enriquez moved back to New York against his parents' wishes in 1996, when he was 22. </p><p>    Ruperto Enriquez and Eustacia Leon Enriquez had decided to leave Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 1980 after both were mugged at knifepoint and robbers broke into their apartment. They worried for their son when he moved back, but he told them not to. </p><p>   For years, the younger Mr. Enriquez, a longtime employee of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., thrived in the city's economic and cultural revival. Last month he was shot and killed by a stranger while riding the subway to Sunday brunch. He was 48 years old. </p><p>   Violence in New York has crept up since the onset of the pandemic. The trend has been broad, encompassing attacks on police, people of Asian descent and low-income and Black and Hispanic communities. </p><p>   Assaults on subways, mundane microcosms in which residents mix with commuters and tourists, have struck a particular chord. Mr. Enriquez's slaying follows a mass shooting in a Brooklyn subway station in April and a spate of people being pushed onto tracks. The attacks are fueling the perception that the city is unsafe, making some workers reluctant to return to the office and potentially hampering New York's economic recovery. </p><p>   Mr. Enriquez embraced city life upon his return. He landed a job on Wall Street and found love and friendship in Williamsburg's bars and galleries. He watched his once-blighted neighborhood transform into a mecca of hipness. </p><p>   \"When he got to New York, he just expanded and grew,\" said Ruperto Enriquez, who immigrated with his wife to the U.S. from Chiautla de Tapia, Puebla, Mexico, in 1971. </p><p>   But the city turned on his son. \"He came back, and it cost him his life,\" the elder Mr. Enriquez said. </p><p>   Mourners from varied walks of life attended a memorial service for Mr. Enriquez last week. Relatives in head-to-toe black with crucifix pendants sat beside financial types in slacks and button-down shirts and bearded hipsters with tattooed arms and carefully uncoiffed hair. </p><p>   \"Dan made friends with all different kinds of people,\" said Cara Bowler, a friend of Mr. Enriquez's for over two decades. \"He was jovial and fun and lighthearted and life-loving.\" </p><p>   When the Enriquez family left Williamsburg in 1980, Ruperto and Eustacia took a young Daniel and his three little sisters to a ranch home in Santa Ana, Calif. The elder Mr. Enriquez worked as a tool and die maker, and another son was born. Daniel devoured books, often reading while walking with his hand on a sister's shoulder to avoid bumping into passersby, his father said. </p><p>   Rising crime pushed the family out again in 1990, said Griselda Vile, Mr. Enriquez's middle sister. They relocated to a relatively affluent neighborhood on the east side of Seattle. Mr. Enriquez earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy in Washington, then enrolled in a master's program in Latin American studies at New York University. </p><p>   After NYU, Mr. Enriquez got a job assisting commodities analysts at Morgan Stanley in the investment bank's equity research department. He found a group of friends at The Abbey, a Williamsburg bar where he could often be found running the pool table, bar-stool philosophizing and generally roistering, said Mark Quinlan, the establishment's former manager. </p><p>   All the while, Mr. Enriquez remained in close touch with his family in Washington, calling his mother often and hosting his siblings and parents on visits to New York. He coached his younger siblings with college applications. His youngest sister, Carolina Swan, was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study in Germany, said his sister Ruth Enriquez de Tiburcio, who works in Washington as a business analyst for an international insurer. </p><p>   Mr. Enriquez helped pay for trips to Europe and Mexico and to situate siblings in New York when they decided to follow him there. Ms. Vile became a teacher in New York public schools. Santos Enriquez, the younger brother, became an art director for advertising agencies. </p><p>   Mr. Enriquez moved in with longtime partner Adam Pollack at a Park Slope, Brooklyn, apartment, where Mr. Pollack handled the cooking and Mr. Enriquez tended the garden, Ms. Bowler said. </p><p>   In 2013, Goldman recruited Mr. Enriquez to work in its global investment research group. He combined low-key professionalism and playfulness, organizing birthday celebrations for colleagues and in recent years sporting an ostentatious mustache, co-workers said. During the pandemic, Mr. Enriquez studied the Portuguese language and Brazilian guitar through online lessons. </p><p>   \"Daniel was very educated, always a lot of fun and spontaneous,\" said Felipe Resende, an Uberlandia, Brazil-based guitar teacher. \"I was planning to visit him in New York in September,\" Mr. Resende said. \"He was going to show me the city.\" </p><p></p>",
