  "title": "Conagra's Warning On Inflation Should Worry Food Investors",
  "text": "<p>That is the takeaway from quarterly results posted on Thursday by Conagra Brands, maker of Duncan Hines cake mixes and Marie Callender's frozen meals. For its fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 27, the company posted strong organic sales growth, which strips out acquisitions and currency moves, of 6% from a year earlier.</p><p>That growth was thanks to substantial price increases as underlying unit volume actually fell 2.6%. Yet even this wasn't nearly enough to make up for higher input costs: adjusted operating margins fell to 13.7% from 14.6% in the prior quarter and 16% a year earlier.</p><p>More concerning was that Conagra took down its guidance for the full fiscal year ending in May. The company now expects adjusted earnings per share of $2.35 for the full year compared with earlier guidance of $2.50 and earnings of $2.64 the prior fiscal year. Adjusted operating margins are now expected to come in at 14.5% versus earlier projections of 15.5%. The culprit: Gross input inflation will be 16% instead of the 14% expected earlier.</p><p>Conagra is one of many food makers, including Campbell Soup and McCormick, that had been issuing what JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman has called \"hockey-stick guidance,\" with results suddenly improving toward the end of their fiscal years. As input costs stabilize, price increases taken earlier should lead to margin recovery -- or so the theory goes.</p><p>\"We don't think we've seen this many hockey sticks laying around since the NHL allowed bench-clearing brawls in the 1970s,\" Mr. Goldman wrote in a note last month.</p><p>Such a pattern of margin recovery would be consistent with the industry's record during previous inflationary episodes. The problem, of course, is that input prices haven't yet stabilized and no one can confidently predict when they will, especially with Russia's invasion of Ukraine now causing rises in everything from energy to wheat prices. Conagra's focus on frozen foods means it is particularly exposed to the rising costs of temperature-controlled transport, company executives said on a conference call.</p><p>Conagra Chief Executive Sean Connolly said the company will undertake new price increases at the start of the next fiscal year focusing on frozen foods and protein snacks like meat sticks. These are some of the company's most popular categories where Mr. Connolly says demand has proven resilient to higher prices.</p><p>Until the input side of the equation becomes more clear, though, investors should take any profit forecasts from food makers with a large helping of salt.</p>",
