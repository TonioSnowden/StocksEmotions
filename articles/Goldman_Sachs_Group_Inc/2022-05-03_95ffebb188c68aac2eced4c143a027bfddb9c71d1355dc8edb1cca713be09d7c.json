  "title": "Garcia's Take: SEC's New Performance-Reporting Rules Won't Dethrone the IRR; The agency's proposals on private-fund-performance reporting are unlikely to stop investors and firms from using internal rates of return",
  "text": "<p>The IRR reflects the timing of a fund's cash flow—the shorter the period between capital calls and distributions, the higher the IRR—a feature that's considered an advantage over other metrics but that also makes the IRR susceptible to manipulation. For example, subscription lines of credit, or loans based on investor commitments to a fund, can inflate returns by delaying capital calls.</p><p>The proposed new rules, among other things, would require firms to report IRRs with and without the impact of those subscription lines. The rules would also require reporting IRRs that reflect the returns before and after fees are charged to investors.</p><p>The SEC's proposal, however, largely preserves the role of IRRs as one of private equity's two main performance metrics, alongside the multiple on invested capital. In its rule-making proposal, the agency notes that IRRs can be useful when combined with other fund data and that it's difficult to measure the performance of private-equity investments, which are illiquid and typically involve irregular series of cash flows.</p><p>The IRR's main appeal is that it goes around this difficulty to provide a much-desired type of measurement, said Ludovic Phalippou, a professor of financial economics at the University of Oxford's Saïd Business School who has researched and criticized the use of IRRs.</p><p>\"People have got used to thinking in terms of rate of returns,\" Mr. Phalippou said of institutional investors. \"They need to see a number that's a percentage of their investment.\"</p><p>The problem, he said, is that IRRs usually don't reflect true returns generated by private-equity investments. For example, a 20% IRR doesn't necessarily mean a fund's limited partners received a 20% annual return on their investment. That would only be true if distributions could be reinvested at that same rate until the end of the fund's life, an often unrealistic assumption that makes the return measure misleading, according to Mr. Phalippou.</p><p>\"When you have an asset that is not continuously traded, you cannot calculate the true rate of return,\" he said. \"You just cannot do it.\"</p><p>Mr. Phalippou is in favor of banning the use of IRRs and replacing the metric with a public-market equivalent, or a gauge that compares a fund's performance with public-equity benchmarks such as the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>Many investors and research analysts, as well as other academic researchers, say that a fund's IRR is a valuable tool for gauging performance and comparing different funds.</p><p>\"It's certainly useful,\" said Alexander Blostein, a managing director for global investment research at investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \"And I think that's probably the only way you could consistently present [fund returns].\"</p><p>The SEC has asked for input on the use of IRRs and on requiring fund managers to report public-market equivalents alongside IRRs. The agency is expected to issue the new rules now that the public comment period has ended.</p><p>Regardless of new regulation, it could just be a matter of time before relatively new benchmark-based metrics become more widely used, said Greg Brown, a finance professor and the executive director of the University of North Carolina's Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise. He pointed to one such metric, so-called direct alpha, which is itself an IRR but measures only the difference between a fund's total return and the benchmark.</p><p>\"Everybody is comfortable with the idea of an annualized excess return,\" he said.</p><p>Still, he added, fund managers \"would much rather report a 12% IRR than a 2% direct alpha,\" even if the two measurements both reflect the same fund's performance.</p><p>\"There's an optics to the way [fund managers] want to talk about performance,\" Mr. Brown said. \"They don't want to talk about market-adjusted performance because it doesn't look as great.\"</p><p>Write to Luis Garcia at luis.garcia@wsj.com</p>",
