Be warned: the answer is quite confusing.&#xa0;</p> <p>A trawl of public records shows it's owned by a daisy chain of corporate entities that stretches to the secretive offshore tax haven of Jersey, before winding all the way back almost to its own front door.</p> <p>By almost, we mean that the chain ends at the office of the private equity firm <strong>TDR Capital</strong>, which is just across the road from the pub. That's where TDR Nominees, an entity controlled by TDR Capital, is based. Here's our diagram of what the public records show.</p> <p>TDR may have just struck the biggest UK leveraged buyout in over a decade, snapping up the supermarket group <strong>Asda</strong> for £6.8bn, but back in 2017 its dealmakers were buying their local watering-hole.&#xa0;</p> <p>People close to TDR say the pub is owned by its portfolio company <strong>Stonegate</strong>, Britain's biggest pub chain — whose drinking establishments include mass-market brands <strong>Be at One</strong>, <strong>Slug and Lettuce </strong>and <strong>Walkabout</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>But there is no mention of Stonegate in the daisy chain of corporate entities above.</p> <p>And the pub's immediate owner <strong>Cubitt House</strong>, a company that runs six upmarket pubs including The Coach Makers Arms and which is in turn owned by TDR, describes itself as a “locally-run independent business”.&#xa0;</p> <p>We can see from public filings that Stonegate bought The Coach Makers Arms in early 2017 and flipped it later that year to Cubitt House. Stonegate's latest accounts show that while it has “operated” Cubitt House's six London pubs, it doesn't own Cubitt House.</p> <p>Our trawl of the public records seems to have left us missing part of the picture. If you know what it is, get in touch.&#xa0;</p> <p>However it is owned, TDR's local pub has become a more pleasant setting in recent years. After taking over the pub in 2017, the new management renovated it, promising to make it “the ideal base from which to relax, unwind and indulge”.</p> <p>There are plenty of other fascinating things to be learnt about TDR from this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ce7092f9-645a-46bd-8007-611c99fd8907\">report by DD's Kaye Wiggins and Rob Smith</a>. It's an “old-world” investor that has bought into pubs, gyms, petrol stations and cruise ships.&#xa0;</p> <p>A few points worth noting:</p> <ul>  <li><p>Co-founder <strong>Manjit Dale</strong>'s “intense” dislike for bureaucracy, at a place likened to a family office, where dealmakers personally invest larger-than-usual amounts in the funds&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>A description of the firm's approach as “buy an asset, take your money back, and sit with a free option on the upside”</p></li>  <li><p>Special “family and friends” investors who pay lower management fees</p></li>  <li><p>The returns of its 2007 fund, which generated a not-so-impressive net internal rate of return of 6.9 per cent by September 2020, according to a presentation shared with investors</p></li> </ul> <p>One case study is the pandemic-hit gym chain<strong> David Lloyd</strong>. TDR has recouped almost three times the £190m of equity it originally invested in the business, company filings show. And while it has told bond market investors of an “equity injection” to help get it through the Covid-19 crisis, that too is funded by debt.&#xa0;</p> <p>Here's how much TDR Capital LLP's members, mostly the firm's executives, have received in payouts — not including carried interest which is where the big money in private equity is typically made.</p> <p>For a firm that likes privacy so much it used a Jersey vehicle to buy its local pub, owning a large supermarket might make it harder to stay out of the spotlight.</p> <h2>Teneo: the PR firm in need of a good PR firm</h2> <p>At <strong>Teneo</strong>, navigating a reputational crisis is just another day at the office.</p> <p>But the self-styled CEO whisperer, which advises big corporations like <strong>Coca-Cola</strong>, <strong>General Electric</strong> and <strong>Delta Air Lines</strong>, has just found a new top-priority client: itself.</p> <p>DD's Arash Massoudi and the FT's Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77203615-503e-4f6d-8011-1dbf99286140\">revealed</a> last week that one of the New York firm's co-founders <strong>Declan Kelly</strong> has ceded some of his responsibilities as its chair and chief executive after allegations of drunken misconduct at a fundraising concert for non-profit group Global Citizen. He also relinquished his seat on the charity's board.</p> <p>The inappropriate behaviour allegedly included the non-consensual touching of a number of women, multiple sources told the FT.</p> <p>“Mr Kelly became inebriated and behaved inappropriately towards some women and men at the event,” said a spokesperson for Kelly, who added that he “deeply regrets his actions” and had apologised to those he had offended.</p> <p>Since then, Teneo has been thrust into the sort of public scrutiny it's typically hired to mitigate.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>General Motors </strong>has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e37f8b75-f29f-4f6f-83d3-b9e559a2c79e\">dropped</a> the firm as its PR adviser, the first of its clients to reveal it has cut ties in light of the incident. Teneo had won the GM account relatively recently, and Kelly was personally advising the carmaker's chief <strong>Mary Barra</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Private equity firm <strong>CVC</strong>, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ef2e618-8944-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2\">bought</a> a majority stake in the business for $350m several years ago, is also under pressure.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Christopher Stadler</strong>, the US-based CVC partner who oversees the Teneo investment is also the chair of Global Citizen. Stadler himself faced allegations of touching women inappropriately, in a 2016 gender discrimination lawsuit. CVC denied the allegations and the case was later settled.</p> <p>Global Citizen is still investigating what exactly happened at its event. But the fallout has raised concerns about Kelly's disproportionate role in attracting top executives as clients.&#xa0;</p> <p>There's also the matter that most of Teneo's staff had no idea their CEO and chair had ceded responsibility at the firm until the FT story.&#xa0;</p> <p>It is just the latest trouble for Teneo's leadership.&#xa0;</p> <p>Just over six months ago, the FT broke the news that Teneo co-founder <strong>Doug Band</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/149647b0-fbe6-4019-9478-fc553ed4ce6c\">was resigning</a> as the firm's president following an article that detailed the breakdown in his relations with former US president Bill Clinton, whose Clinton Global Initiative he had helped launch.</p> <h2>Jim Chanos raises the red flag on Spacs</h2> <p>Prodding through a certain Houston energy company's trading positions back in 2000,<strong> Jim Chanos</strong> said the group was <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1004916006978550640\">“a hedge fund in disguise”</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>More than two decades later, being “the guy that called <strong>Enron</strong>” still carries a certain weight.&#xa0;</p> <p>The famed short seller now has words of caution over Wall Street's favourite game as of late: the Spac boom. The blank-cheque bonanza is building “castles in the sky”, Chanos warned, as certain sponsors play “fast and loose with their projections” to lure in retail investors.</p> <p>The 63-year-old's hedge fund <strong>Kynikos Associates</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da44b18e-51e5-40ab-9e34-70879952edce\">bet against</a> a number of Spac companies that are “very bad businesses” and whose valuations “have gotten silly”, Chanos told the FT's Harriet Agnew and DD's Ortenca Aliaj.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's not to say he isn't playing the other side. Kynikos has taken long positions in Spacs that are yet to find a deal but are trading below the $10 price at which they list.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://nymag.com/news/business/52754/\">“catastrophe capitalist”</a> has had no shortage of victories over the years, from shorting <strong>Michael Milken</strong>'s <strong>Drexel Burnham Lambert</strong> junk-bond empire in the 1980s to the roughly<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f72e8bc-fafd-4ede-a418-22904e6d5b5f\"> $100m gleaned</a> from betting against fallen German payments group <strong>Wirecard</strong>.</p> <p>But there have been losses, too. The more than decade-long bull run has made it a tough time to be a short seller. Kynikos assets have slumped from a $7bn peak at the end of 2008 to below $1bn. A longtime <strong>Tesla</strong> bear, Chanos has also been burnt by his bets against the electric carmaker as its share price has surged.</p> <p>There are bubbles beyond Spacs, Chanos told Harriet and Ortenca, pointing to<a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/this-pole-dancing-company-turned-oil-driller-is-the-lat-1847149374\"> <strong>Torchlight Energy</strong></a> — a US pole-dancing company-turned shale producer whose shares have soared more than tenfold this year.</p> <p>“Life is rough on the short side,” he said. “If I was a stripper pole company, but announced a merger, I think I could raise a lot more money than the short sellers are right now.”</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Toshiba</strong> shareholders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fc03a35-4915-4f44-bfb2-f4b4db4f4196\">ousted</a> <strong>Osamu Nagayama </strong>as the chair of the company's board following a series of corporate governance failures at the Japanese conglomerate. <strong>George Olcott</strong>, another board director, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a748c71-ef75-458f-8628-3a2b8072ae63\">resigned in the wake of the vote</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Burberry</strong> chief executive <strong>Marco Gobbetti </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94d097cf-a1e0-4089-9489-a9b8424b63a1\">has quit</a> the British luxury group to join Italian rival <strong>Salvatore Ferragamo</strong> after five years at the helm.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Barclays</strong> has hired <strong>Bronson Albery </strong>as its head of real estate banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He joins after spending over two decades at <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Citigroup</strong> appointed its corporate broking head<strong> Andrew Seaton</strong> to chair its UK capital markets and advisory arm. It also named <strong>James Fleming</strong> and<strong> Jan Skarbek </strong>as co-heads of the division.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Separately, Citigroup promoted three of its managing directors within consumer and retail banking: <strong>Emre Eler</strong> and <strong>Robert Plowman</strong> to co-heads of Emea consumer products investment banking and <strong>Roberto Costa</strong> to head of global luxury investment banking.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Cavalier credit</strong> Star investor-turned inmate Daniel Kamensky wasn't the first to take advantage of chaotic credit markets when he tried to finagle a sweetheart deal for his hedge fund. Courts are simply behind the times when it comes to tackling modern debt disputes.

As economists search for an explanation, an elephant looms in the room: it could just be flat-out racism.
