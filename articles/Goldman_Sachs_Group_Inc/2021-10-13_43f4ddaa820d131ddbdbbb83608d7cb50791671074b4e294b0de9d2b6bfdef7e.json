  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- The House voted along party lines on Tuesday to raise the U.S. borrowing limit into December, as Democratic lawmakers wrestled with how to set a new ceiling for U.S. debt later this year over Republican resistance. </p><p>   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) called the House back from a week away from Washington to pass the debt-ceiling increase that cleared the Senate last week. The early return followed a warning from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to House Democratic leaders that if the chamber failed to act this week, the U.S. would be unable to pay its bills. </p><p>   The White House has said that President Biden would sign the measure into law. </p><p>   The bill, which the House approved on a 219-206 vote, would increase the debt ceiling by $480 billion, an amount that the Treasury Department has said would allow the U.S. to pay its bills through Dec. 3, assuming it had also exhausted all of its cash-conservation strategies. Goldman Sachs has projected that the money would last somewhat longer, though not past the end of the year, suggesting the U.S. has roughly two months before Congress must address the debt ceiling again. </p><p></p>",
