  "text": "<p><strong>One job move to start: Goldman Sachs</strong> has hired ex-<strong>McKinsey</strong> executive <strong>Kevin Sneader </strong>to serve as the bank's co-president in Asia-Pacific, months after he was ousted from the global consulting firm. Full story <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61818a23-4561-4e69-8065-ab2fad1dc00b\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Bill Gates and a Saudi royal shake hands over the Four Seasons</h2> <p>Roughly seven miles apart in Riyadh are two buildings that, for different reasons, occupy a special place in the life of Saudi Arabia's <strong>Prince</strong> <strong>Alwaleed bin Talal</strong>.</p> <p>Sheathed in aluminium and sparkling glass, the 99-storey <strong>Kingdom Center</strong> is the glitzier of the pair.&#xa0;</p> <p>A giant kettlebell of a skyscraper, it was developed by Prince Alwaleed's <strong>Kingdom Holdings</strong> investment vehicle, through which he has amassed a vast portfolio of assets including a stake in the <strong>Four Seasons</strong>. The hotel chain occupies 237 guest rooms in the tower.</p> <p>The second building, the <strong>Ritz-Carlton</strong>, is no less opulent, but if Prince Alwaleed has mixed feelings about the sprawling neoclassical estate, it may not be a question of mere architectural taste.&#xa0;</p> <p>The billionaire was among the more than 100 high-profile Saudis who were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee4f6844-033c-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5\">detained</a> there in 2017 as Crown Prince <strong>Mohammed bin Salman </strong>consolidated power in the kingdom.</p> <p>On Wednesday Prince Alwaleed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3889fdcd-b151-4540-ae29-3a0f54216c1c\">agreed to sell</a> half of his Four Seasons stake to <strong>Bill Gates'</strong> investment vehicle <strong>Cascade</strong>.</p> <p>The two men have shared ownership of the chain since they collaborated on a 2007 deal to take it private for $3.4bn — Wednesday's deal values the hotel group at $10bn, including debt.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's the first big transaction made by Gates since his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04f3eaff-075a-495d-975b-50f2bd652eba\">split</a> from <strong>Melinda French Gates</strong> earlier this year, an event that triggered the division of one of America's largest private fortunes and raised questions about the future of one of its most prominent charitable foundations.</p> <p>Prince Alwaleed's vast fortune, too, has been a subject of speculation.&#xa0;</p> <p>Unlike several other detainees who quietly agreed to make large payments as redress for allegedly corrupt activities, Prince Alwaleed <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests-alwaleed-transcript/transcript-of-reuters-interview-with-saudi-arabias-prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-idUSKBN1FG0X9\">told Reuters</a> at the time of his 2018 release that he wanted to leave the Ritz in “complete vindication”, and didn't expect any assets to be transferred to the state.</p> <p>The terms of the Saudi tycoon's partial exit from his Four Seasons investment, at least, are unambiguous. Kingdom Holdings said it expected to realise a gain of $1.6bn on the 24 per cent stake that it is selling.&#xa0;</p> <h2>The quick-fire round: public auctions make a comeback (of sorts)&#xa0;</h2> <p>Auctions for control of publicly traded companies, overseen by the UK's <strong>Takeover Panel</strong>, haven't been a big feature of the country's M&amp;A landscape until the past few years.&#xa0;</p> <p>That began to change notably in 2018 when the auction process was used to settle the future of pay-TV group <strong>Sky</strong>, which resulted in a £30bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b402969a-cbd5-11e8-b276-b9069bde0956\">knockout bid</a> from US company<strong> Comcast</strong>.</p> <p>This year, in the middle of a frenzy to buy London-listed companies, the process is starting to feature more prominently.&#xa0;</p> <p>First, the panel planned an auction for the security company <strong>G4S </strong>in February. One of the bidders, private equity-backed <strong>GardaWorld</strong>, promptly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5559c3de-cb0e-4ad7-9598-66d3b376470e\">stepped back</a> in February after making a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40122e34-a8a7-4c21-b27c-963db57849f3\">hostile bid</a> last year, and paved the way for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a25bb929-a497-45b2-b2d8-2265ddb67036\">sale</a> to US rival <strong>Allied Universal</strong>.</p> <p>Then it planned one for <strong>Vectura</strong>, the inhaler business at the centre of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec2a5103-2b98-4bf8-85b6-2a9e0fb975bc\">bidding war</a> between private equity group <strong>Carlyle</strong> and <strong>Philip Morris International</strong>, the maker of <strong>Marlboro </strong>cigarettes. In response, Carlyle quickly said it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b860f52-ddf7-447b-bd74-c44b25a69da7\">wouldn't raise its price</a>, so the auction never got off the ground.&#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1048786-60c3-4080-b2d5-b8da2b48a1d1\">Now it could hold one</a> for <strong>Morrisons</strong>, the UK supermarket that two private equity consortiums <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c55630f-9a8e-447c-8b8f-dabb11c72983\">are fighting for</a>. It said on Wednesday that it was having “discussions around an orderly framework for the resolution of this competitive situation”, possibly via an auction.</p> <p>US buyout group<strong> Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice </strong>is in the lead in the Morrisons battle, but a rival group led by <strong>SoftBank</strong>-owned <strong>Fortress</strong> hasn't gone away and it has urged shareholders not to act yet.&#xa0;</p> <p>Participants on both sides have thought for a while that it may head in this direction, since the takeover battle has dragged on for months, causing uncertainty.</p> <p>The point of the auctions process is to bring things to a head — sometimes with several days of game theory playing out in the public domain and sometimes with a speedy capitulation. We'll find out in the next few weeks which it will be.&#xa0;</p> <h2>‘Failure is not a crime': the trial of Elizabeth Holmes begins</h2> <p>As opening statements <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7462815-f022-4e11-a3fd-a7845b1191a2\">kicked off</a> on Wednesday in the trial of <strong>Elizabeth Holmes</strong>, Silicon Valley's best and brightest were likely watching with bated breath.</p> <p>And that's not just because they're curious whether Holmes, who prosecutors allege deliberately misled investors and patients about the efficacy of her start-up Theranos's blood-testing technology, will be found guilty.</p> <p>As DD's Miles Kruppa <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7462815-f022-4e11-a3fd-a7845b1191a2\">reports</a> from the courthouse in San Jose, Holmes's lawyers began their defence by arguing her failure to build Theranos into a viable business wasn't a crime.</p> <p>“Elizabeth Holmes did not go to work every day intending to lie, cheat and steal . . . Trying your hardest and coming up short is not a crime,”<strong> Lance Wade</strong>, an attorney for Holmes, told jurors during opening arguments.&#xa0;</p> <p>If convicted, Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison — which would make her one of just a few prominent figures in Silicon Valley accused of wrongdoing and actually going to jail for it.</p> <p><strong>Anthony Levandowski</strong>, the co-founder of <strong>Google</strong>'s self-driving car project who was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/496c76bf-2d26-4a54-ab3b-934fe019a576\">sentenced to prison</a> for stealing trade secrets and allegedly using them to help build a rival programme at <strong>Uber</strong>, came close. However, he was pardoned by former president<strong> Donald Trump</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>But if prosecutors can convince the jury that Holmes knew her blood-testing devices didn't accurately perform the range of tests she claimed, the case could mark a major affront to Silicon Valley's hype and hubris-fuelled culture, in which sweeping statements are often made in the name of innovation.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Credit Suisse</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/90378dd6-517c-4442-ae47-67b655ddd4b9\">has appointed</a> <strong>Rafael Lorenzo </strong>as its chief compliance officer. Lorenzo, who has run the bank's internal audit division since 2017, will take over from <strong>Lara Warner</strong>, who departed alongside at least six other senior executives in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c10d0b81-f2ef-48c3-8e9c-17419f4af21b\">management overhaul</a> in the wake of twin crises at <strong>Archegos Capital </strong>and <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>American International Group</strong> chief executive <strong>Peter Zaffino</strong> will take on the <a href=\"https://www.aig.com/about-us/news-and-media\">additional role</a> of chair, succeeding <strong>Brian Duperreault</strong>, who will retire from the board at the end of this year.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Heather King</strong>, formerly a top lawyer for Theranos, has left her partnership at<strong> Boies Schiller Flexner</strong> in San Francisco, <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/former-theranos-general-counsel-king-leaves-boies-schiller\">per Bloomberg Law</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> has appointed<strong> Beau Bohm</strong> as co-head of equity capital markets origination and advisory in the Americas, based in New York.
