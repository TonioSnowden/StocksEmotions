Take our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2021-01-10/\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Investment banks are raking in <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/a67e0300-98a8-4e29-890a-0949135933ba\">record sums</a>, with fees surging past $100bn in the first nine months of the year thanks to a rush of dealmaking.</p> <p>Wall Street's top banks and leading boutique advisers have benefited from the boom in mergers and acquisitions as well as hot equity capital markets. Fees for both are at the highest level since records began two decades ago and have hit $60.6bn in the year to date, according to Refinitiv.</p> <p>Lenders also earned $52bn underwriting loan and debt offerings in the first nine months of the year as companies rushed to lock in low rates.</p> <p>Five US banks, led by JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, have taken the greatest share of the $112.6bn in fees earned this year. The two Wall Street lenders are estimated to have hauled in a combined $18bn in fees.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas and have a great weekend.

Supporters claim it could be the platform for what has become known as Web 3.0, where a series of decentralised apps could one day challenge Big Tech's offerings.

When his column first appeared, “the world belonged to liberalism”, he writes. Now, western democracies are threatened by a lack of public trust. “Public faith in democracy — in the rule of law and the institutions of the state — rests on a perception that the system at least nods towards fairness,” he writes.</p> <p><strong>Taliban confront reality </strong>Delivering the administrative services to which Afghans have become accustomed is a tall order at a time of economic collapse, withdrawal of western financial support and an exodus of expert administrators since the Taliban takeover. But there is one service that is both available and popular under the Islamists: <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/fb9641e6-107d-4c84-9e5a-7b44969186cf\">speedy justice</a>.</p> <p><strong>Algorithms could guide decisions — if they work</strong> Life is full of difficult decisions. Who should be hired or fired? What grades should students receive in their exams? An increasingly popular solution is to delegate those decisions to a data-driven algorithm.
