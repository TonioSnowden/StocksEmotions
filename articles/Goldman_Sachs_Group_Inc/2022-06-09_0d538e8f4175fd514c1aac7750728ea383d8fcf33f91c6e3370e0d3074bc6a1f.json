  "title": "European natural gas futures jump after explosion at U.S. LNG plant",
  "text": "<p>Reuters reported the plant, which provides about a fifth of U.S. LNG processing, will shut for at least three weeks.</p><p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs left their U.S. NG00 and European natural gas contract forecasts unchanged.</p><p>\"From an export perspective, the near-term impact from the 15 mtpa Freeport outage would be moderated in the first week by the use of LNG already in storage tanks to load ships, though a reduced liquefaction rate beyond that would start to be felt. That said, we estimate it would take an outage lasting more than 70 days before its estimated 20 mcm/d impact on NW European storage took end-summer inventory levels below 90% of full vs our current 93% of full expectations,\" said analysts led by Samatha Dart.</p><p>European natural gas futures jump after explosion at U.S. LNG plant</p>",
