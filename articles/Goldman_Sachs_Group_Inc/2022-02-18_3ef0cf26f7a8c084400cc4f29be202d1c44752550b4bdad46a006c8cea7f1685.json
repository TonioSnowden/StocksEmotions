  "text": "<p>Dear reader,</p> <p>Moral relativism is the belief that ethics are determined by immediate context. “When in Rome, do as the Romans do” remains a common attitude within multinationals. This has excused business practices in Mexico or Macau that were verboten in Manhattan or Mayfair.</p> <p>In the past couple of decades, the dictum has come into painful collision with US prosecutors and regulators. You cannot really argue with these moral absolutists. First, their targets are bribery, organised crime and terrorism. Second, they have the weight of the world's dominant superpower behind them.</p> <p>Thanks to several stories featuring companies such as <strong>Ericsson</strong>, <strong>Glencore</strong> and <strong>Raiffeisen</strong> <strong>Bank</strong>, this week's newsletter is about ethics. I am ignoring abstruse debates concerning environmental, social and governance investment to focus on the subject as delineated in corporate news. If you have thoughts on this or Lex generally, please email me at <a href=\"mailto:Lexfeedback@ft.com\">lexfeedback@ft.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Ericsson</strong> is best known as a stolid Swedish manufacturer of telecoms equipment. It has not, despite 5G rollout and US sanctions on Chinese rival Huawei, lived up to Lex's hopes as an investment. It seemed out of character that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a7a35b0-104f-4beb-b52e-f45e6e02b4ba\">it paid to dodge customs</a> and move consignments through Iraqi zones controlled by terrorists such as Isis.</p> <p>Even more improbably, the business tried to dress up its detection of these suspect payments as a triumph for internal audit.</p> <p>Investors and analysts also habitually underestimate the gravity of conduct crises. This time, they seemed to go to the opposite extreme. The news wiped more than $5bn off Ericsson's market capitalisation. Fines and settlements that large seem unlikely. This confirmed Lex's suspicion that the impact of bad news on tech-related stocks is these days amplified by rate-related market jitters, also reflected in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eac7446a-6f75-4dee-b696-d11f1e8378f0\">emerging market bond sell-off</a>. </p> <p><strong>Glencore's</strong> provision of $1.5bn for potential fines and settlements looked a more sensible sum than Ericsson's implicit $5bn. The Swiss trading and mining group is the subject of official probes into allegations of bribery and market manipulation in such countries as the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p> <p>Our view had always been that Glencore needed a new boss to tame its trading culture and reduce its corporate governance discount. The persuasive chief executive Gary Nagle has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aaaaa0ee-b764-4a92-b262-4c29ccd67ed7\">made a good start</a>. The process will only be over when the findings of official probes have been published in full detail, gory or otherwise. <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> is still taking reputational hits from the 1Malaysia Development Berhad wealth fund fraud exposed in 2015, though its ability to hit new financial targets is the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea2deaab-3563-404d-9da2-1bfd5837bb84\">bigger concern </a>for investors.</p> <p>They will discount shares in <strong>Raiffeisen</strong> against peers so long as the Austrian bank remains exposed to Russia, a country most western businesspeople rightly regard as disreputable. About 12 per cent of assets and 20 per cent of equity are within the borders of the Bear. The stock has lately become <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b0d6454-97dc-4acf-9bb5-2d9a564a4d84\">a proxy</a> for strengthening or weakening expectations that Russia will invade Ukraine.</p> <p><strong>City lawyers</strong> have financial reasons for hoping Russia will stay its hand too. Clients from ex-Soviet countries, primarily Russia and Ukraine, are the biggest group of foreign litigants in the UK's commercial courts. An invasion would prompt tougher US sanctions on Russia and the seizure by Russian proxies of Ukrainian oligarchs' domestic assets. That would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83311f21-c749-478f-8dc6-dc6ca7bd16ad\">hurt the earnings</a> of London's commercial litigators.</p> <p>The Ukraine crisis has triggered heart-searching in London over the contribution of foreign kleptocrats to its high-end economy. Ethical purists have a similar problem with <strong>sin stocks</strong>. But excluding tobacco, alcohol and gambling stocks from your portfolio <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dbf0c683-4091-4d91-9aa9-1912e4d5c005\">can be expensive</a>. <strong>British American Tobacco</strong> has just unveiled a £2bn buyback. One long-range study points to sin stock outperformance of 3 to 4 per cent a year.</p> <p>In a note containing trace elements of irony, Lex suggested that sin stocks were ethical investments provided that investors lobbied for change.</p> <p>Computer games companies have so far dodged categorisation as sin stocks, despite the addictive character of their products. Shared online environments also harbour sexual predators. Lex reckons sales growth is slowing at <strong>Roblox</strong> because nervous parents are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8984d80f-ecc4-446e-ae64-35af2e6c50d6\">switching children's devices off</a> and pushing them outside for healthy play.</p> <p>Roblox, a tech stock exposed to hair-trigger selling like Ericsson, fell up to a quarter. <strong>Palantir</strong> shares meanwhile dropped 16 per cent on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c1de847-88c6-4702-be75-42a62c706d96\">thin disclosure and continuing losses</a>. The software company could reveal its clients, reputedly including the CIA. But, as an old joke dictates, it would have to kill us all afterwards.</p> <p>Spooks from countries such as Russia, China and North Korea are a more serious threat to our wellbeing. State-sponsored cyber attacks — and those of criminals — are risks that businesses are rushing to cover using <strong>specialist insurance</strong>. Ransomware attacks occurred every 11 seconds in 2021, according to one data provider. Crooks can now rent ransomware-as-a-service programmes on the dark web for as little as $40 a month.</p> <p>Premiums can <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d6da6e7c-0b95-4e45-a1ad-082e7ae4e4e0\">only go on rising</a>.</p> <p>Writer Joseph Conrad located the “heart of darkness” in the Belgian Congo, which later became the DRC. These days, westerners are more likely to see the Kremlin as the centre of moral turpitude. In reality, it is lurking on the internet and is only ever a few clicks and firewalls away.</p> <p>Enjoy your weekend,</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Guthrie</strong><br><em>Head of Lex</em></p><p>Source: Jonathan Guthrie 2022 'The Lex Newsletter: businesses behaving badly' FT.com 18 February.
