  "title": "Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Monthly Analysis  ---  Exchange-Traded Funds:  Investors Look Overseas Again  ---  International ETFs have taken off in recent months, thanks in part to the run-up in U.S. stocks  ----  By Ari I. Weinberg",
  "text": "<p>   International exchange-traded funds are back in favor. </p><p>   The turnaround has been building for months. Following the summer 2020 rally for U.S. stocks, interest in international developed- and emerging-markets stocks picked up in November and December and has surged through February. According to FactSet, international-stock ETFs (excluding \"global\" funds, which have U.S. exposure), have gathered $31 billion in net new assets in the first two months of this year, compared with $30 billion for all of 2020. </p><p>   \"The domestic equity run was so extraordinary that investors ended up being underweight in both developed and emerging markets\" outside the U.S., says Andrew Mies, chief investment officer at 6 Meridian in Wichita, Kan. \"The recent flows show a move to rebalance.\" </p><p>   \"It's really an exciting time,\" says Gargi Chaudhuri, head of U.S. iShares markets and investments strategy at BlackRock. \"International investing is happening in more diverse ways than in the past,\" she says. </p><p>   Among the themes Ms. Chaudhuri has observed are a shift into ESG funds and more interest in targeted investments, as opposed to broad international funds. \"Everything plays into the broad global growth story,\" she says. </p><p>   The International Monetary Fund is projecting 5.5% global GDP growth in 2021, with growth in emerging markets and developing economies as a group projected at 6.3%, led by India (11.5%) and China (8.1%). Among developed economies, Spain (5.9%), France (5.5%) and the U.K. (4.5%) are expected to grow at a faster pace than the projected 4.3% for advanced economies as a whole. (The IMF estimates U.S. GDP growth at 5.1% in 2021.) </p><p>   The stalwarts of international ETFs include funds from Vanguard, BlackRock and Charles Schwab that offer wide exposure to developed- and emerging-markets indexes. The 10 largest international-stock ETFs hold 58% of all assets in the $945 billion category. </p><p>   Some investors may consider investment in the S&amp;P 500 stock index to be enough exposure to economies outside the U.S., because of American companies' extensive sales in foreign markets. But that doesn't give investors exposure to the domestic growth of emerging markets -- what BlackRock refers to as \"emerging wealth.\" And the share of sales of S&amp;P 500 companies that comes from overseas has trended lower over the past several years, according to separate analysis from Goldman Sachs and S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. </p><p>   So, many advisers recommend that investors in the U.S. looking to benefit from growth overseas invest in international stocks. \"For most U.S.-based investors, we allocate about 30% of equities internationally,\" says Craig Birk, chief investment officer at Personal Capital, a unit of Empower Holdings. That allocation \"provides maximum diversification benefits while recognizing increased volatility from international, which is primarily driven by currency swings,\" he says. </p><p>    A wave of investment anticipating a renewal of global economic growth or just a widespread rebalancing of portfolios in the wake of the recent surge in U.S. stocks \"could favor international funds broadly in the coming years,\" says Mr. Birk. He generally recommends broad funds but thinks emerging markets and small-caps are promising areas for investors who want something more focused. </p><p>   Some investors have shunned China, the biggest emerging market. Funds investing in large and midcap Chinese stocks have had moderate outflows despite year-to-date returns in the low teens, according to FactSet. By contrast, iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex-China ETF (EMXC) has attracted $250 million in net flows in the first two months of this year, or 59% of its total assets, But ETFs focused on Chinese consumers are attracting assets, from Xtrackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (ASHR) to Global X MSCI China Consumer Discretionary ETF (CHIQ). </p><p>   Broad country-specific funds garnering investor interest include iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF (EWT) and iShares MSCI India ETF (INDA). </p><p>   Among developed markets, the U.K. has been battered but may offer some opportunities as growth rebounds from the effects of the pandemic. Enduring Brexit on top of the pandemic in 2020 sent the U.K. to an 11% contraction of GDP last year and a 7% decline in the 100 largest-capitalization domestic stocks, compared with a 3.7% contraction of GDP and a 21% rise in the Russell 1000 index in the U.S., according to investment adviser Research Affiliates. In a February research note, Research Affiliates founder and Chairman Rob Arnott wrote that \"U.K. equities stand out as offering one of the most attractive risk-return trade-offs, priced to earn a return a notch higher than emerging-market equities with significantly lower volatility.\" </p><p>   ETFs tracking the U.K. include the $3.3 billion iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF (EWU) and the $180 million Franklin FTSE United Kingdom ETF (FLGB). </p><p>    Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual funds and ETF research at CFRA, offers a word of caution for investors considering ETFs focused on particular countries. \"If you are considering adding a country-specific ETF to a portfolio that includes regional funds, be sure that you understand how that country may be represented in the regional fund already,\" he says. \"It's OK to overweight in a specific area, but you don't want the combined exposures to overdo it.\" </p><p>   Anticipation of a global economic rebound has the potential to re-energize laggard small-cap and value stocks in foreign markets, largely left out of last year's stock-market rally that was fueled mostly by large growth stocks and momentum trading. For example, iShares MSCI EAFE Value ETF (EFV), which holds value stocks in developed markets, has attracted $4 billion in net flows in the first two months of this year while gaining 3.9%. </p><p>   Two actively managed funds from American Century Investments -- Avantis Emerging Markets Equity (AVEM) and Avantis International Small Cap Value (AVDV) -- have also drawn new investors since the beginning of the year for their focus on so-called investment factors, which are specific economic trends, company metrics and market-sector trends expected to boost returns. Both funds are outpacing comparable broad-based indexes in emerging and developed markets. </p><p>   The rush into equity ETFs investing along environmental, social and governance (ESG) themes is also finally catching on for international ETFs. Developed- and emerging-markets ESG funds from BlackRock and Vanguard are attracting investors by tilting toward companies with high ESG scores and eliminating companies operating in controversial industries such as weapons or those that contribute heavily to climate change. </p><p>   Two funds from WisdomTree Investments that eliminate exposure to state-owned industries in China and in emerging markets -- WisdomTree China ex-State-Owned Enterprises Fund (CXSE) and WisdomTree Emerging Markets ex-State-Owned Enterprises Fund (XSOE) -- are also drawing investor interest this year. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Weinberg is a writer in Connecticut.
