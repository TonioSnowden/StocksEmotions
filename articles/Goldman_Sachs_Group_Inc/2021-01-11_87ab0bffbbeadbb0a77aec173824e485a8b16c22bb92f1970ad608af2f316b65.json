  "text": "<p>When London went into lockdown last March, so did my beloved wallet: a perfectly lovely, palm-sized amalgam of buttery navy leather and neat white stitching courtesy of the Australian accessories brand Bellroy. It was parked in the top drawer of my bedside table. And there it has remained ever since.&#xa0;</p> <p>Multiple reasons were at play. Given I wasn't commuting to the office and my daily orbit was confined to the few blocks surrounding my flat, I no longer needed all that&#xa0;<em>stuff</em>: bank cards, ID, that wadge of café/smoothie bar/grocery store loyalty cards (each, without fail, boasting just one stamp).</p> <p>Plus, like everyone else in the pandemic climate, I didn't want to touch anything unnecessarily. Amid worries that the handling of cash would lead to an increased risk of virus transmission (research from the Bank of England now <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2020/2020-q4/cash-in-the-time-of-covid\">indicates</a> the risk is “low”), many restaurants and retailers in major cities switched to card- or digital-only payments. </p> <p>As I didn't fancy dealing with cards or machine pin-pads I downloaded Apple Pay — just six years after its launch — and this Luddite has since gone about his days armed with scarcely more than an iPhone.&#xa0;</p> <p>I'm hardly alone. In March, Palina Pradhan, a 34-year-old lawyer at a magic circle firm in London, decided her burgundy Burberry wallet's time was up. “I've not carried cash since then; I just carry a couple of cards to buy groceries, so stopped having any use for my wallet,” says Pradhan. “It means I can go handbag-less if I want, especially if I'm just running errands.”</p> <p>Charlie Reid, who works in renewable energy finance in Sydney, is “delighted” to be rid of his wallet, as is James Contos, an executive director at Goldman Sachs in London who lost his halfway through 2020 and — apart from one ill-fated trip to the office without his building pass — has realised he doesn't need his leather companion long-term.</p> <p>Chiara Rimella, an editor at Monocle magazine (and a former colleague of mine), also retired her wallet and turned to Apple Pay. “Now I only have one thing to worry about — my phone — and I always know where that is because I'm constantly on it,” she says. “Plus [using digital payments] helps me keep track of how much I spend so much better [than a physical card] because I get immediate notifications from my banking app about all those small purchases I wouldn't have remembered.”</p> <p>This anecdotal evidence seems to be supported by sales figures. According to market research firm Euromonitor International, in 2020 sales of wallets and coin purses fell by almost 20 per cent globally compared with 2019, and by nearly 18 per cent in the UK (bearing in mind overall spending across many categories decreased in 2020).&#xa0;</p> <p>Like suits, ties and stilettos, the wallet's slide into obsolescence appears to have been accelerated by the pandemic.&#xa0;Even pre-Covid, few people were toting bundles of dosh as digital payments became more widespread. George Costanza's “exploding wallet” from the 1998 episode of <em>Seinfeld</em> — stuffed with banknotes in a sight that would give minimalist Marie Kondo heart palpitations — seems truly of another era. Yet while wallets have become ever slimmer, the one thing that had not diminished was their sales — until now.</p> <p>“Currently, card usage is at an all-time high as consumers ditch cash for the ease and perceived hygiene benefits of paying by card,” says Thomas Slide, senior financial services analyst at global research firm Mintel. “The future of the physical card could also come under threat as payment technology evolves at a rapid pace . . . having shifted from cash to card, the shift from cards to other payment methods could prove easier for consumers to understand.” Ultimately, with no need for cash or cards he concludes that the days of the physical wallet are “numbered”.</p> <p>Yet wallets play other roles beyond the practical. Like fragrances or lipstick, they're an entry-level product enabling consumers to buy a piece of a luxury brand. If they can't afford a £3,250 Prada dress, the brand's popular Saffiano leather wallet might be in reach at £340.</p> <p>Also, they remain a popular gift option. Damien Paul, head of menswear at Matches Fashion, says the luxury e-tailer's strong wallet sales last year are at least partly attributable to a “more indulgent gifting” season. “Gifting is a huge part of any men's wallet business,” he says, “and because people are away from their loved ones, the customer seems to be trading up and going for something really special.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Brands need us to keep buying small accessories but, in the future, these might not be wallets or card holders. Lina Calabria, co-founder and chief operations officer of Bellroy, says the brand's phone cases with one or three card slots are selling well (so you can have your driver's licence or a back-up bank card should your phone die) but, even so, we're not quite at the stage where you can leave home with a phone and nothing else. There's a small miscellany of other items we need on us each day, including keys; earphone cases; possibly prophylactics, gum and sunglasses; and Covid-19-related essentials such as masks and sanitiser. </p> <p>Bellroy, whose biggest markets are the US, UK and Australia, is seeing great demand for lightweight pouches that can fit a few staples and often come with a handy long strap or in a sling. Among the current women's bestsellers for luxury London retailer Browns are zip pouches from Saint Laurent and Burberry, while Matches' Paul says high-end men's brands are finding success with ever-more-diminutive cross-body bags.&#xa0;</p> <p>Calabria thinks “eventually people are unlikely to carry wallets in the traditional sense”. She predicts 10-15 per cent of people will stick to a “very traditional-looking wallet, another 10 per cent will have a one-card carry solution [like a phone holder], 40 per cent might have a small bag, and then another 40 per cent” will have something else. But she thinks we're “pretty far away from not carrying <em>anything</em> with us at all”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Minimalists will hope she's&#xa0;wrong. Contos, from Goldman Sachs, says he “hates carrying stuff — my dream is to have everything done by fingerprint, including house entry so I don't need keys.” In 2019 Hyundai became the first carmaker to sell models that rely on fingerprint identification, while tech giants such as Samsung are offering similar “smart lock” solutions for the house, although these are far from mainstream.&#xa0;</p> <p>Personally I'm eyeing Patagonia's black Ultralight Mini Hip Pack, which resembles a miniature bum bag (bear with me) but looks best worn across the chest. The wallet will be staying in the top drawer.&#xa0;</p> <p><em>This article has been amended since publication to reflect the fact that Palina Pradha is 34 years old</em></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em> on Instagram to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><em>Listen to our podcast,&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/culture-call\"><em>Culture Call</em></a><em>, where FT editors and special guests discuss life and art in the time of coronavirus.
