  "text": "<p>\"Recession risks are more limited in 2022 but rise significantly by mid-to-late 2023,\" the Citi analysts said. \"Equity markets have begun pricing this in already, but we expect fallout to be felt mostly\" in the first half of next year, they wrote.</p><p>Related: Goldman Sachs sees some risk the U.S. economy will stumble and fall into recession in next 24 months</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX was edging lower Monday afternoon to around 4,385, as companies' earnings season for the first quarter moves into full swing this week.
