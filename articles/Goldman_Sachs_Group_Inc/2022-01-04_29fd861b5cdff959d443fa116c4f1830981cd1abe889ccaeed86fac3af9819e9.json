  "text": "<p>TPG plans to raise as much as $877m in an initial public offering that could value the US buyout firm at more than $9bn, as it seeks to tap a wave of investor interest in private equity.</p> <p>After laying out its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fd93e65-9cc5-4156-9489-214b7a8c44d2\">intention to go public</a> last month, TPG, which was co-founded by David Bonderman and Jim Coulter in 1992, said on Tuesday that it planned to sell 28.3m shares at between $28 and $31 each. </p> <p>TPG resisted a stock market listing following the financial crisis, a route taken by rivals including Blackstone, KKR and Apollo, and one that has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25649306-ac8a-4183-894a-7df1eb798acf\">paid off handsomely</a> as their shares surged. The Texas-based group, whose investments include Spotify, Uber and Airbnb, has $109bn in assets.</p> <p>TPG has said it would convert from a private partnership into a corporation with a single class of stock within five years of its listing as part of its ambitions to draw on public investors to finance its expansion.</p> <p>In a filing with regulators on Tuesday, TPG also disclosed that China Life Insurance, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e7a0870-1d28-11e4-b927-00144feabdc0\">acquired a $250m stake</a> in TPG in 2014, will sell as much as 5.6m shares in the IPO.</p> <p>Forty per cent of the proceeds from the IPO&#xa0;will be used to purchase holdings from existing outside investors, the firm said in its prospectus, while the remainder will be used to finance expansion into new business lines and markets.</p> <p>TPG executives including Bonderman and Coulter, as well as chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1bd5a18a-1fbc-4ead-9867-1e829b1715f1\">Jon Winkelried</a>, a former top Goldman Sachs banker, own a total of about 240m shares and units, according to Tuesday's filing. Those holdings will be worth more than $7.4bn if TPG sells shares at the top of its price range. </p> <p>While the firm did not break out most of the individual holdings, it disclosed that Bonderman, who is TPG's chair, has pledged 24.99 per cent of the partnership units he owns to an unnamed financial institution as collateral for a loan.</p> <p>TPG's expected market value would be dwarfed by competitors including Carlyle and Apollo. Blackstone, the industry's largest firm, is valued at more than $150bn.</p> <p>After disastrous bets on Texas utility TXU and casino empire Caesars Entertainment, TPG has over the past decade sought to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c17d406-8d3f-4903-966d-955ba441cdc8\">reposition itself</a> as one of the buyout industry's top investors in fast-growing companies.</p> <p>It has also built a successful healthcare buyout franchise, and Rise, a business with $13bn in assets aimed at environmentally and socially beneficial investments.</p> <p>However, TPG's focus on traditional private equity investments means it still relies on performance fees for about 80 per cent of its income. By contrast, Blackstone, Apollo and KKR have cut their dependence on the large but erratic fees generated by leveraged buyouts, shifting into steadier credit, insurance and real estate investments.</p> <p>TPG is expected to embark on a similar push to diversify, saying in its prospectus that it will use the IPO to help fund new investment strategies and pursue acquisitions. </p> <p>As part of its IPO, TPG is also restructuring operations by lowering the percentage of income from performance fees for public shareholders and increasing the percentage from more stable management fees. </p> <p>TPG declined to comment beyond the filing.</p><p>Source: Antoine Gara in New York 2022 'US buyout firm TPG targets $9.3bn valuation in IPO' FT.com 4 January.
