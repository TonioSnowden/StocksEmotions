The September figure has extra significance as it is used to calculate increases in pensions and benefits. Prime Minister Liz Truss said today the “triple lock” protecting pensions would stay but did not make commitments on benefits. The other unanswered question is where public spending cuts may fall. Either way, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4899e19a-bc11-4382-a9e9-94ba51e51104\">there isn't much left to cut</a>, says columnist Sarah O'Connor.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Suella Braverman</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30c14c6a-cd7d-434f-9ce3-eb6df254cf48\">quit as UK home secretary</a> in another blow to Liz Truss's government. Braverman insisted she had committed “a technical breach” of security rules, but her resignation letter contained a broadside against Truss and the breaking of election pledges. She was replaced by Grant Shapps.</p></li>  <li><p>President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0600d0d8-4f66-4f88-bda5-af21b1966b0d\">authorised the sale of more oil</a> from the US's strategic reserve and set out a plan to replenish the stockpile.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Nestlé</strong>, the world's largest foodmaker, increased prices by 7.5 per cent in the first nine months of the year — the biggest amount in decades — pushing its sales growth to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6a1a3cd-f018-4184-b94e-d035413ddbc8\">highest level in 14 years</a>.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5e3f15a-8099-45cc-a5d6-a7fa685917c3\"><em>live blog</em></a></p>  <p>Good evening,</p> <p>As temperatures begin to drop and energy prices continue to rise, European households and industry face a bleak winter. </p> <p>Yesterday, ahead of an EU summit tomorrow, Brussels unveiled a fresh package of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1dde83af-97b9-4dc2-9031-8a9ba33ac06b\">emergency measures</a>. These include a cap on the traded price of gas and measures to limit volatility in derivatives markets. The moves form part of what European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen called “further steps towards an energy union”.</p> <p>The need for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a59561a-56da-421b-bf00-a511a04edb49\">common EU energy policy</a> is also the subject of today's column by chief economics commentator Martin Wolf, who argues that it needs to accelerate the shift to renewables as well as help member states cushion households from the worst of the price shock.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a separate rebellion is growing among EU member states over an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/528f10d4-8cfb-42b8-967d-0da0c9a041da\">international energy treaty</a> that allows multinationals to sue governments to protect their investments. Campaigners say the pact, designed in the 1990s, hinders governments' efforts to curb greenhouse gases.</p> <p>Finding alternatives to Russian gas is still the most pressing demand.</p> <p>European countries have been holding <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/96611190-3c09-48b7-8ded-7b2651590f94\">talks with Qatar</a>, the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas. The country's energy minister told the FT that next year could be “much worse” once reserves were depleted, especially if there was a harsh winter and gas did not start flowing again from Russia.</p> <p>Countries outside the bloc have problems too. In the UK, campaigners warned yesterday that 11mn homes could be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/92ca0fcc-c40f-4eff-89fc-496349582eb5\">pushed into fuel poverty</a> after the government <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9668dab-d495-4331-9e8c-fc580af254c7\">ditched its commitment</a> to help all households with bills for two years, replacing it with six months of support followed by targeted help for the most vulnerable.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Europe's industrial companies, which employ about 35mn people, or 15 per cent of the working population, are strapping themselves in for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75ed449d-e9fd-41de-96bd-c92d316651da\">an exceptionally difficult winter</a>, as today's Big Read explains. </p> <p>Some sectors have already halted production and many worry that industry could start migrating to places with cheaper energy. “We are risking a massive deindustrialisation of the European continent,” said Alexander De Croo, Belgium's prime minister.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11506559.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Gas is EU industry's single most important source of energy (it consumes more than a quarter of the EU's total supply) and is critical to the chemical and fertiliser sectors in particular, as well as the bloc's wider industrial strategy.</p> <p>“If the German chemicals industry goes down, three weeks later every supply chain in Europe has a problem,” said the head of the industry's trade body.</p> <p><em>Could we soon witness the end of electricity sharing as countries focus on their own energy needs?
