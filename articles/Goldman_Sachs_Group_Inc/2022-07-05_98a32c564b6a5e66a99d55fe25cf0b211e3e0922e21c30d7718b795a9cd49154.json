  "title": "Oil Prices Pulled Lower by Dimming Demand; West Texas Intermediate crude closes below $100 a barrel for first time since May",
  "text": "<p>Contracts for Brent crude, the international benchmark, dropped $10.73, or 9.5%, to $102.77 Tuesday. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. standard, finished down $8.93, or 8.2%, to $99.50 a barrel, its first close below $100 since early May and its largest one-day percentage decline since April.</p><p>Just under a month ago, Brent futures were trading above $120 a barrel, with global supply pressured by fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>The war shows no immediate signs of winding down, but traders' attention is shifting to the possibility that a downturn in economic growth could cool demand for fuel. Consumer spending and industrial orders showed signs of slowing in data released last week, underscoring investors' building concerns about the possibility of a recession.</p><p>Average gasoline prices across the U.S. have retreated to $4.80 a gallon, off records above $5 a gallon that drivers saw last month, according to AAA. Gasoline is still more than 50% higher than a year ago, however, leading drivers to cut back.</p><p>More broadly, some crude-oil traders are feeling the weight of negative sentiment that is touching a range of commodities as the economic outlook dims, said Jim Ritterbusch, president of oil-advisory firm Ritterbusch &amp; Associates. S&amp;P's broad index of commodity prices was down 6.4% on Tuesday.</p><p>\"The acceleration of recession expectations in the second half of the year has weighed on a slew of commodities, and oil has gotten swept up in that to a large extent,\" Mr. Ritterbusch said.</p><p>Declining prices are forcing some traders to unwind bullish bets on crude, he added, exacerbating the selloff.</p><p>Some energy traders have zeroed in on indications that gasoline demand is already tempering. On a four-week-average basis, demand was down about 2% year-over-year through June 24, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.</p><p>At the same time, oil companies have gradually responded to $100-a-barrel prices by moving to increase production, a process that could see more crude reaching markets later this year, further easing prices, said Louise Dickson, an analyst at Rystad Energy. Rystad has raised incrementally its forecast for U.S. crude production for the months to come, she said.</p><p>A stronger U.S. dollar has been another factor weighing oil prices down in recent sessions. The dollar has continued its climb against other major currencies, rising to near its highest value versus the euro in two decades. When dollars become more expensive for foreigners, so do commodities trades denominated in U.S. currency.</p><p>The pain also touched energy-sector stocks, which lost about 4% on Tuesday, the steepest decline of any of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors. The broad-market index was up 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.4%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index advanced 1.8%, reversing earlier losses, in the first trading day of a holiday-shortened week.</p><p>Besides recession fears, the typical summer decline in agricultural markets has speculators backing away from commodities, which were a popular bet this year with fund managers looking to protect the rest of their portfolios from rising prices.</p><p>\"Hedge funds are taking chips off the table,\" said Dave Whitcomb of Peak Trading Research.</p><p>Analysts warned that declining crude-oil prices may not bring drivers and other fuel consumers as much relief as would be expected normally. That is because limits to global refining capacity have pushed the ratio of retail fuel prices to crude-oil prices far above typical levels.</p><p>There are few fast solutions because new refineries take years to bring online, and environmentalist concerns about fossil fuels have discouraged new investment, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note published over the weekend.</p><p>\"As long as refinery capacity remains quite constrained in the U.S. and Europe, there's going to be this continued unusually big spread between crude oil price and these refined products,\" Ms. Dickson said.</p><p>â€”Ryan Dezember contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>Oil Prices Pulled Lower by Dimming Demand</p>",
