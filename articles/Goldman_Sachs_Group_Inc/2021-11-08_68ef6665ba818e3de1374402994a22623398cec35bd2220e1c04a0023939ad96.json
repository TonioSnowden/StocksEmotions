  "title": "China's Economy Faces Risk of Yearslong Real-Estate Hangover; Booming market helped juice growth for more than a decade; without it, China could struggle to match previous pace, economists say",
  "text": "<p>While economists generally agree that purging the market of irrational behavior is necessary, they say the campaign will at least partly deprive China of one of its biggest sources of growth. Chinese policy makers have signaled that they recognize there will be a trade-off for economic growth, but have shown no indication that they plan to scrap the regulations on developers and home buyers.</p><p>Real-estate activity accounts for about one-fourth of gross domestic product in China—considerably more than in the U.S.—and speculative behavior has supported employment and revenue-collection in cities for years. Without a booming property market, China is more likely to clock annual growth of around 3% to 5% in the next few years, economists say, instead of the more than 6% growth it has been accustomed to.</p><p>\"A successful campaign to make housing more affordable will come at a cost, perhaps putting 5-6% growth out of reach durably,\" wrote economists from the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based global association of financial firms, in a recent report. The IIF projects China's GDP to expand by an average of 3% or lower each year from 2022 to 2031 as its economy matures, per capita incomes rise and real estate slows.</p><p>That's lower than the average annual growth rate of 5% that China needs to maintain from now until 2025 to avoid the middle-income trap—a phenomenon in which developing economies stall before people's incomes catch up to more advanced economies—according to speeches earlier this year by Zhu Guangyao, China's former vice minister of finance.</p><p>Real estate and other related industries contributed 24% of China's GDP in 2016, compared with 15% in the U.S., according to calculations by Oxford Economics.</p><p>\"There is simply no other sector or industry that can fill up the gap if the property industry is no longer a growth driver,\" said Yao Wei, an economist at Société Générale in Hong Kong.</p><p>Chinese officials have long emphasized the need for more high-quality growth from domestic consumption, as opposed to wasteful investments in property and infrastructure.</p><p>After years of fast-climbing home prices and rising debt, Chinese authorities imposed new rules during the past year meant to slow the market and limit how much developers can borrow to keep expanding. Those steps led to a sharp decline in sales and raised worries of a possible severe housing downturn.</p><p>Many analysts say Beijing has plenty of tools to contain the damage. Yet even a controlled drop in real-estate activity will affect lots of people.</p><p>Private companies such as struggling developer China Evergrande Group employ hundreds of thousands of workers nationwide, while also supporting construction firms and other contractors. Nearly 20% of China's 285 million migrant workers earned income from construction-related jobs in 2020, data from China's National Bureau of Statistics shows.</p><p>Centaline Property, a major property agency in China with nearly 40,000 staff, plans to lay off around 1,000 agents in its Shanghai and Shenzhen offices as the market slows, said a person familiar with the matter. Centaline declined to comment. Agents at property firms say they are earning fewer commissions, which could affect spending.</p><p>Local governments, which face limited options under Chinese regulations for raising revenue through taxes and borrowing, have become overwhelmingly dependent on land sales, which are expected to slow as the real-estate market cools. In 2020, land-sale revenues reached $1.3 trillion, equivalent to 84% of local-level fiscal revenue that year, up from 70% in 2019 and 37% in 2015, according to data provider Wind.</p><p>If localities can't sell as much land in the future, it will limit their ability to invest in infrastructure, another growth engine for China, and repay their own rising debts. The total debt of local-government financing vehicles, a popular way for officials to obtain off-balance-sheet loans, reached about 52% of China's GDP by the end of 2020, according to calculations by Goldman Sachs.</p><p>\"The primary source of revenue to pay off these debts is through land sales,\" said Houze Song, a research fellow at the Paulson Institute, a Chicago-based think tank.</p><p>In the southwestern city of Beihai, where land sales accounted for 47% of total revenue for the local government in 2019, Wei Zhigang, a manager at a midsize developer, said average monthly sales have declined by more than half compared with pre-pandemic levels. Prospective buyers have become more reluctant to close deals as they anticipate more price drops, he said.</p><p>The company will no longer join land auctions in the city, but will instead focus on new developments in wealthier regions such as Zhejiang province, said Mr. Wei, whose company mainly sells resort properties. \"The winter for us in the industry hasn't arrived yet,\" he said. \"We have to be cautious.\"</p><p>Weaker demand for land could also curb the amount of fresh credit other businesses can obtain. More than half of the total loans in China's banking system are backed by land, a popular collateral Chinese banks accept when making loans, said Dinny McMahon, author of \"China's Great Wall of Debt.\"</p><p>\"If land prices and property prices start to decline, the ability and willingness of China's financial system to make loans will contract as well,\" he said.</p><p>Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University, said it is clear that Beijing wants to promote more high-quality growth, but it remains to be seen whether China will be willing to stomach much lower GDP next year, when growth momentum in both exports and consumption are expected to level off.</p><p>\"In the long run it's a good thing to stop the bubble, but in the short run it's very painful to do so,\" Mr. Pettis said. \"The question is whether they will continue to try to repress the growth of debt or will they step on the gas pedal again to get higher growth numbers.\"</p><p>Write to Stella Yifan Xie at stella.xie@wsj.com</p><p>China's Economy Faces Risk of Yearslong Real-Estate Hangover</p>",
