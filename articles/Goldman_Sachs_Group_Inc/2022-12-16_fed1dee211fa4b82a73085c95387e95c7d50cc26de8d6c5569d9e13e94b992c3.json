  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  With the economy teetering and China bracing for a gigantic wave of Covid-19 cases, Beijing is finally sounding the right notes on business and growth. Last week's Politburo meeting called for \"greatly boosting\" market confidence, \"even greater efforts to attract and use foreign capital\" and maintaining an \"active\" fiscal stance. </p><p>\n  The question is whether it is too little, too late. </p><p>\n  November data released Thursday painted a picture of an economy already in deep distress: Retail sales slid 5.9% from a year earlier, investment growth slowed and industrial production rose just 2.2% -- less than half of October's 5% rise. While the abrupt loosening of China's zero-covid controls will eventually support growth, the nation also will have to contend with the collateral damage of reopening. That could include not only widespread illness and frightened consumers but, potentially, more political instability if the toll from the exit wave grows too large. </p><p>\n  Given such a backdrop, it is unsurprising to see China's leadership finally sounding a much clearer pro-growth tone. </p><p>\n  Last week's Politburo meeting statement was notable for omitting the longstanding catchphrase \"housing is for living in, not for speculation\" -- the first time a Politburo readout hadn't included it since 2020, according to Morgan Stanley. Bloomberg reports that the Central Economic Work Conference, which sets the general policy direction for the coming year, may declare that the \"deleveraging\" of the housing sector has been successfully completed. </p><p>\n  Such rhetorical contortions might seem abstract but are important because they send signals to Communist Party cadres lower down the totem pole, giving them political cover, for example, to consider further easing down-payment requirements or other housing-related restrictions in their local markets. </p><p>\n  This signaling, in combination with Beijing's recent moves to widen financing channels for property developers, can be quite powerful. If there was any good news from Thursday's data release, it was on the housing market: Prices across 70 cities fell an average of 0.25% in November, but that was the smallest fall since July. Despite tepid overall growth in credit, there are signs that mortgage lending may be starting to recover. Goldman Sachs estimates that medium and long-term loans to households grew by 4.8% in November on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis -- up from 3.4% in October. China's housing market is still in dire straits, but a partial rebound by the second half of next year looks more plausible. </p><p>\n  But even assuming that a housing market and consumption recovery materializes, much of the damage of the past three years is likely to persist. </p><p>\n  A more growth-oriented and practical Chinese leadership, if indeed it has returned, would be welcome news for the whole world. But people inside and outside of China have been given many reasons to remain skeptical. </p><p></p>",
