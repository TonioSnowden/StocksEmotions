  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: CME Group</strong> has approached fellow Chicago exchange company <strong>Cboe Global Markets</strong> about an all-share deal to acquire the owner of the Vix volatility indices for nearly $16bn, people familiar with the matter <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/c05613d0-601d-42a6-a191-18788549970b\">told</a> the FT's Philip Stafford and DD's James Fontanella-Khan. After the FT first reported the news of the approach, CME <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/media-room/press-releases/2021/8/18/cme_group_deniesrumorsofabidforcboeglobalmarkets.html\">issued a statement</a> saying it denied being in conversations to acquire Cboe. Cboe did not comment on the story.</p> <p><strong>And one more thing to start</strong>: The British government <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55b3e146-87cb-469b-a128-5865cb1abe87\">has opened</a> a formal investigation into the planned £2.6bn takeover of UK-based defence specialist Ultra Electronics by a rival that is owned by a US private equity company, citing national security concerns.</p> <h2>Bankers get creative as US IPOs of Chinese companies hit a wall</h2> <p>Chinese tech groups used to be among Wall Street's most cherished clients.</p> <p>Questions about the shaky legal structure enabling hundreds of highly valued Chinese companies to sell shares in New York were shrugged off as bankers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5e09db3-549e-4a0b-8dbf-e499d0606df4\">raked in huge fees</a>, and yield-starved investors salivated over the prospect of juicy returns.</p> <p>Bankers — with <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> at the top of the league tables — clocked a record $460m advising Chinese companies on their New York IPOs in the first half of 2021. And it all went off without a hitch until a few weeks ago.</p> <p>Now, they're <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56a7dff0-cc63-40b0-ad96-7ce82780cce2\">struggling to find buyers</a> for IPOs that, until a few months ago, were viewed as one of the safest bets in town.</p> <p>It could all end in tears for the more than 50 Chinese listings that had been lined up for the second half of the year in New York. There has been widespread uncertainty since Chinese regulators <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eac18f66-5c9b-4cd0-a4e6-a86f5464ad6e\">moved to restrict</a> overseas listings at the start of July over data security concerns following ride-hailing app Didi's blockbuster listing.</p> <p>“The IPO window is firmly shut for now and so bankers are rushing to discuss what the options are,” said the chief executive of a Hong Kong-based private equity firm with stakes in numerous Chinese tech companies that were nearing IPOs in New York.</p> <p>That means bankers are pitching any alternative they can come up with to salvage the dozens of imperilled deals on their ledgers.&#xa0;</p> <p>Emergency exits include redirecting listings to Hong Kong, exploring mergers with special purpose acquisition companies, and backdoor listings — through which a company would inject its assets into a listed vehicle.</p> <p>But even Hong Kong seems to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25a11563-49d8-438e-8b67-0eeb82ae53a6\">no longer offer safe harbour</a> — <strong>Cloud Village</strong>, a music streaming service, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f949a689-9e10-4a93-9b81-c8032ee3a620\">cancelled plans</a> for a $1bn IPO in Hong Kong this month following a disappointing response from investors.</p> <p>And if Chinese issuers do manage to push ahead with US listings this year, investors are going to be wary after the punishing waves of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ccf409d-489b-411a-8b4f-4b5d8b8ed0b1\">regulatory scrutiny</a> that have sent stocks like <strong>Alibaba </strong>and <strong>Tencent </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e6f9a08-37be-4ab3-ae15-953533ab33b5\">tumbling</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>For Wall Street, Chinese tech is now the furthest thing from a safe bet.</p> <h2>SoftBank engages in a Fair fight</h2> <p>Another company backed by <strong>SoftBank</strong>'s Vision Fund is facing bankruptcy. Once more, the start-up borrowed hundreds of millions of dollars from <strong>Greensill Capital</strong>. And yet again, that loan is now at the centre of a brewing spat.</p> <p>After construction company <strong>Katerra </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a70b6130-b062-4850-8759-4a10a5a26f3d\">filed for Chapter 11</a> in June, Santa Monica-based car leasing business <strong>Fair</strong> is considering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2e43aa9b-e1b9-47c0-a60a-761c5cded01e\">doing the same</a>. The bankruptcy would be part of a debt-for-equity swap at the SoftBank-backed company that would pass the keys over to its lender . . . SoftBank.</p> <p>Confused? Let us explain.</p> <p>Fair originally borrowed from Greensill Capital, another SoftBank Vision Fund portfolio company, in 2019. But at the end of last year, SoftBank itself bought out Greensill's $315m loan to the struggling car leasing group.</p> <p>In the world of private equity, this sort of manoeuvre is a standard part of the playbook. Firms like <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>, which have well-established distressed debt investing arms, regularly buy into the senior debt of portfolio companies facing difficulties. But in the world of venture capital — where investors are less familiar with the right-hand side of the balance sheet — it's much more unusual.</p> <p>That might explain why it's ruffling feathers on the west coast. A debt-for-equity swap would wipe out other shareholders including Fair's founder and chair<strong> Scott Painter</strong>, who, in a clash with SoftBank, says that Fair rejected fully funded bids to buy back his company over the past year.</p> <p>Fair's chief executive<strong> Brad Stewart</strong>, a turnround specialist who was parachuted in last year, told DD's Rob Smith that the company's woes actually predated Greensill's loan, as the business had defaulted on its previous credit lines with mainstream lenders in 2019.</p> <p>He was refreshingly blunt in his assessment of where the company's problems began: “Most venture companies don't raise a shit ton of debt. If they do, they don't default.”</p> <p>To dig deeper into the wider SoftBank-Greensill psychodrama, check out the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72713b5e-628b-4029-8a8f-7b11d767dc72\">long read</a> from last month.</p> <h2>Rating agencies get nervous about risky debt</h2> <p>After the Fed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b71f0c32-6cfb-11ea-89df-41bea055720b\">stepped in</a> to cushion corporate bond markets at the start of the pandemic, even the companies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/01a84753-b33e-493c-83e9-4100c62409c4\">hit hardest</a> by Covid-19 could load themselves up with debt.</p> <p>More than a year on and the borrowing spree hasn't abated, with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32a57864-d983-46b0-bbfa-85fd2d2361e5#comments-anchor\">$650bn in “speculative grade” debt</a> sold this year — on track to reach a record.</p> <p>Among the biggest beneficiaries are private equity firms, whose portfolio companies are well-represented on the lowest rungs of the credit ratings ladder.&#xa0;</p> <p>Easy access to debt markets helped buyout groups strike deals worth more than $500bn in the first half of this year — their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd9571a3-726c-4995-9954-23a8dcf12b19\">busiest six months</a> since records began four decades ago, as the chart below shows. The debt binge has also enabled private equity firms to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32184b16-1982-45e7-b1b4-ab10b1be81ec\">pay themselves dividends</a>.</p> <p>All of a sudden, though, the borrowing blitz has rating agencies feeling nervous, the FT's Joe Rennison <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32a57864-d983-46b0-bbfa-85fd2d2361e5\">reports.</a></p> <p>There are “clear signs of risk-taking and a lot of lower-rated issuance,” warned <strong>Gregg Lemos-Stein</strong>, chief analytical officer for corporate ratings at <strong>S&amp;P</strong>, cautioning of higher defaults down the road.&#xa0;</p> <p>“There are many more companies that are fragile,” said <strong>Christina Padgett</strong>, head of leveraged finance research at <strong>Moody's</strong>. “They have layered on a lot of debt.” The situation could grow more precarious if interest rates rise once all the debt needs to be refinanced.</p> <p>But is anyone listening? It's not in dealmakers' immediate interest to do so, as buyouts are booming, and the mood in corporate credit markets remains bullish. It might take more than a warning from rating agencies to stand in the way.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Boris Collardi</strong>, the former chief executive of <strong>Julius Baer</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/55a4f32c-f402-4aa8-bfd7-134ba5fa731f\">is stepping down</a> as a partner at rival private bank <strong>Pictet</strong> after he was rebuked earlier this year by the Swiss financial regulator over a long-running money-laundering scandal involving his former employer.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Bank of America </strong>has named <strong>Adam Hodes</strong> as vice-chair of financial institutions investment banking. He will join in New York from<strong> MetLife</strong>, where he has been global head of M&amp;A since 2011.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Blackstone</strong> has appointed <strong>Hubert Larenaudie</strong>, the former president and chief operating officer of video game developer <strong>Voodoo</strong>, as a senior adviser.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Kate McKinley</strong> has been named chief legal officer of <strong>Allspring Global Investments</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fdf0f369-5d5f-4385-8689-158ad173f793\">rebranded</a> <strong>Wells Fargo Asset Management </strong>business acquired by <strong>GTCR</strong> and <strong>Reverence Capital Partners</strong>. She was previously general counsel at <strong>State Street Global Advisors</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Binance</strong>, the cryptocurrency exchange, has appointed <strong>Greg Monahan</strong>, a former US government criminal investigator, as its global money laundering reporting officer.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>McDermott Will &amp; Emery</strong> has added three new partners to its transactions practice: <strong>Kevin Brophy</strong> joins in Houston after working as general counsel for <strong>Kayne Anderson Energy Funds</strong>, and <strong>Jim Salerno</strong> and <strong>Robert da Silva Ashley </strong>join in New York from <strong>Jones Day</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Between a Spac and a hard place </strong>BuzzFeed chief Jonah Peretti orchestrated a complex blank-cheque deal to bring the media group public and achieve profitability.
