  "title": "Private-Equity Firms Poach Talent to Chase Wealthy Investors; Alternative-asset managers are furiously hiring investment advisers and marketers as they seek to raise capital from individual investors",
  "text": "<p>Apollo Global Management Inc., Blackstone Inc., Ares Management Corp., KKR &amp; Co. and EQT AB have been the most active hirers of private-wealth employees this year, according to Jensen Partners, an executive search firm for the alternative-investments industry.</p><p>Private-wealth hires by these firms more than quadrupled in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period in 2021, and more than doubled in the second quarter through June 24, Jensen Partners said. These firms have added at least 122 employees focused on private-wealth fundraising in 2022, Jensen Partners said.</p><p>\"There is an immense talent war among the top five to 10 private-equity firms in the world. They are all making offers to similar candidates,\" said Sasha Jensen, the firm's founder and chief executive. She says she sees candidates weighing multiple offers with attractive guarantees and being recruited after just a few months in a new position.</p><p>\"There's a run on the bank for talent,\" said Ms. Jensen.</p><p>In the U.S., people with at least $1 million in liquid assets or $200,000 in annual income can invest in private funds.</p><p>Until recently, most private-equity firms all but ignored these investors. Marketing funds to so many individuals is expensive and logistically challenging. For many firms it is also unnecessary, given how much capital they have been able to raise from institutional investors such as public pension funds and endowments.</p><p>But with public pension funds facing potential overexposure to the asset class, the biggest private-equity firms are now going after this long-neglected market. The hiring competition has not slowed despite recession fears in recent months that have caused other companies, even on Wall Street, to slow hiring or even begin layoffs.</p><p>\"There's a search for talent that to the outside can seem a little manic,\" said Raj Dhanda, global head of wealth management for Ares's wealth management solutions group. Mr. Dhanda said Ares's private-wealth head count has grown roughly 30% in the past year, to about 105 people.</p><p>\"This is a strong market for people looking to move, or who have been in the private-wealth channel. They know they are in demand and they have many options.\"</p><p>Firms face some challenges in building their private-wealth channels. One is the sheer number of new types of employees they need to hire to break into the market: investment advisers; marketers; people with relationships at private banks; and legal, operational and compliance staff.</p><p>Ms. Jensen calls it a \"talent-starved market.\" While they have been hiring from one another and from other alternative-asset managers, private-equity firms have also been poaching employees from traditional financial-services companies such as banks and mutual-fund managers.</p><p>With ambitious plans for attracting individual investors, Apollo has added the most private-wealth employees this year, according to Jensen Partners' data. The firm now has about 150 employees in its private-wealth group, most of whom have joined in the past year, including about 60 who joined through the acquisition of the U.S. asset management group of Griffin Capital Co., a firm spokeswoman said.</p><p>Apollo's high-profile additions include Edward Moon, who joined from HSBC Holdings PLC to lead the firm's global wealth business for the Asia-Pacific region, and Howard Nifoussi, formerly of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., who joined the firm as head of U.S. wealth management for the firm's client and product solutions group.</p><p>Though competitors are bulking up, Blackstone still has the largest retail arm among private-equity firms, experts say. The New York firm's private-wealth group has grown to about 275 employees from around 115 at the end of 2019, a spokesman said.</p><p>About 100 of these private-wealth employees have joined in the past year, said Todd Myers, chief operating officer of Blackstone's private wealth solutions group. The firm may not maintain this hiring pace, but \"there's no doubt the focus we have on the space and build-out of the team will persist,\" said Mr. Myers.</p><p>Write to Chris Cumming at chris.cumming@wsj.com</p>",
