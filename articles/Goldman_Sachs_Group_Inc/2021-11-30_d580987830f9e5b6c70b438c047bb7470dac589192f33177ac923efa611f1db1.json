  "text": "<p>David Solomon, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, has warned New York City's leaders that they cannot take its position as a global business destination for granted and that higher taxes threaten to make it less appealing for companies and their employees.</p> <p>In an interview at the Financial Times' Global Banking Summit, Solomon said “New York is not going away” but cautioned that “it's also not guaranteed for any urban centre that you have a permanent place in the world”.</p> <p>“New York has to be aware that there are good choices, and it's got to make sure it keeps itself super-attractive,” Solomon said. “At the end of the day, incentives matter, taxes matter, cost of living matters.”</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic has prompted some New York residents to move to lower-tax states such as Florida amid longstanding tensions over <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22c9b76b-ea36-4c8c-8cae-1bbb104098d2\">how the city taxes high earners</a>. </p> <p>New Yorkers already pay some of the highest tax rates in the US, and the top personal income tax rate for state residents&#xa0;would rise further to 66.2 per cent under the latest version of President Joe Biden's&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/abeaab3d-d3d2-4b6d-88f8-d45372676974\">Build Back Better legislation</a>, according to an&#xa0;<a href=\"https://taxfoundation.org/democrats-top-income-tax-rate/\">analysis</a>&#xa0;by the Tax Foundation, a US think-tank. </p> <p>In March, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0bd0de08-10ce-4953-a76f-ced3828f0f67\">Solomon</a> was one of roughly 250 chief executives who signed a <a href=\"https://pfnyc.org/news/250-of-nys-large-employers-and-small-business-leaders-challenge-need-for-state-tax-increases/\">letter</a> to Andrew Cuomo, then governor of New York, and state lawmakers opposing corporate and individual tax increases.</p> <p>Goldman, which has about 43,000 employees, is headquartered in New York but has been expanding in domestically in areas such as West Palm Beach, Florida, and Dallas, Texas — two states where the top tax rates under Biden's proposed changes would be 51.4 per cent. </p> <p>“We believe in that flexibility, giving people choices in terms of where they want to live,” Solomon said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, he predicted that upward wage pressure in the US, which prompted Goldman to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b33f3645-ff93-4309-a575-f92641faaa43\">boost salaries</a> for its younger bankers this year, would eventually ease.</p> <p>“We're in a place here where what you're seeing in finance is similar to what you're seeing in almost any industry broadly,” Solomon said. “I don't think that's permanent.” </p> <p>He also reaffirmed Goldman's plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad1a8608-1069-4f9b-bf26-5dd9ae03f0a8\">expand in China</a> despite escalating geopolitical tensions between the Biden administration and Beijing. </p> <p>“My own view is: there are going to be challenges in that relationship, and that could have an impact in the short term on certain activities that we would or would not be involved in China. </p> <p>“But broadly speaking, with a 10- or 20-year view, our business in China will grow.”</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2021 'Goldman Sachs chief warns New York City's future ‘not guaranteed'' FT.com 30 November.
