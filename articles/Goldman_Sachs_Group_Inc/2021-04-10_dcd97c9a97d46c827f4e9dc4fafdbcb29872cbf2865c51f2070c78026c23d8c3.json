  "text": "<p>Following the release on April 1 of a news release titled \"Goldman Small Cap Research Publishes New Research Report on RocketFuel Blockchain, Inc.,\" the penny stock surged by as much as 335% in four days. Several lines down is a notice that the research firm, which accepts payment for reports, \"is not in any way affiliated with Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.\"</p><p>And the report's subject, formerly known as B4MC Gold Mines Inc., and before that as Heavenly Hot Dogs Inc., doesn't appear to have any revenue and maybe not even a product, based on litigation about a patent that expired. The report was written by an analyst who, while he appears not to have lit the world on fire at more-established firms, has an auspicious name: Rob Goldman. Neither Mr. Goldman nor RocketFuel Blockchain responded to emailed questions.</p><p>Fortunately today's growth-stock investors, especially when they see the words Goldman and Blockchain, always read the fine print.</p>",
