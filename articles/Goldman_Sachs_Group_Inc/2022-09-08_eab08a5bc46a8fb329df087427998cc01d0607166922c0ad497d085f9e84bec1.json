  "title": "EY to Announce Breakup Plan for Audit and Advisory Businesses; Split carries risks for Ernst & Young but could generate big payouts for partners",
  "text": "<p>The far-reaching proposal would separate EY's accountants, who audit companies such as Amazon Inc., from its faster-growing consulting business of advising on tax issues, deals and more.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What will be the ripple effects of Ernst &amp; Young's splitting its auditing and consulting businesses? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The move could lead to substantial rewards, including multimillion-dollar payouts for EY's 13,000 partners. EY projects faster growth and greater profitability for the consulting business once it is freed from the regulatory constraints that affect audit firms. The consulting firm will go public to help raise cash for the partner payouts.</p><p>The strategy also carries significant risks, industry watchers said. Splitting EY, which operates as a global network of separate firms in around 140 countries, is a costly, time-consuming effort.</p><p>\"It's a massive undertaking,\" said Michael Shaub, an accounting professor at Texas A&amp;M University. \"It's hard to imagine the number of issues that have to be resolved and how you navigate that.\"</p><p>Spinning off the consulting arm involves nuts-and-bolts issues like splitting shared resources from technology to human resources. More complicated will be a division of the firm's big and lucrative tax unit, parts of which will go to both firms and other practice areas.</p><p>\"You can see that in theory [a split] would be appealing, but in practice is it going to turn out to be really complicated and expensive?\" said Martin White, a senior analyst at Source Global Research, a consulting-industry research company.</p><p>After the votes and logistics, the next step will be readying the consulting business for an IPO late next year. The sale of a 15% stake in the firm will require audited financial statements, which as a partnership, EY hasn't had to provide.</p><p>Then there is the knotty question of how to split the money raised by that sale among different countries and partners.</p><p>All this takes time—and money—to work out, analysts said. EY is paying for advice from several top-tier Wall Street banks and law firms, including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p><p>EYs rivals will be tracking how the plan progresses, according to Mr. White. \"The other firms are watching and waiting [as they]…try to figure out whether it's worth a roll,\" he said. The rest of the Big Four—Deloitte, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers—have all said publicly they have no plan to follow EY's lead.</p><p>EY's ambitious project, which started in November under the internal code name Project Everest, has already been delayed. The go-ahead decision unveiled this week was originally scheduled for June, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported.</p><p>If the deal does go ahead, the consulting company has to meet demanding growth targets, while likely operating without the EY brand, the people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Its performance will affect the value of the windfalls to the EY partners who join the new company, typically worth seven to nine times their annual compensation. Those windfalls will be paid as shares in the new business, over five years. The partners face a significant cut in cash pay, which will offset to some extent by their payout from the deal.</p><p>Write to Jean Eaglesham at Jean.Eaglesham@wsj.com</p><p>EY to Announce Breakup Plan for Audit and Advisory Businesses</p>",
