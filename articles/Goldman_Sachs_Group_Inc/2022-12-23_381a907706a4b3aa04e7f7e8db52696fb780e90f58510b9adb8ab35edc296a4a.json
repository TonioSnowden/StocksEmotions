  "title": "Financial Firm Beneficient Pushed Boundaries Before Bond Program's Collapse; Investigations into Beneficient's former parent company are examining how retail investors were sold $1.3 billion of bonds that are now in default",
  "text": "<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission determined last year that the firm's accounting method was incorrect. The method made it appear that Beneficient was generating revenue growth as a lending business even while its underlying portfolio of alternative assets was actually incurring losses.</p><p>Beneficient's parent company at the time, another alternative asset company called GWG Holdings Inc., sold more than $500 million in bonds to investors after filing the incorrect financial statements. Even after GWG and Beneficient straightened out their books, the bond-selling network that GWG needed to stay afloat was effectively frozen, and the company filed for bankruptcy in April facing a federal securities investigation and owing $1.3 billion to thousands of individual investors.</p><p>Those investors and GWG's newly appointed managers have also been investigating what happened before the collapse, and how the company came to be used as a capital-raising vehicle for Beneficient, a financial-services firm led by Dallas-based entrepreneur Brad Heppner.</p><p>Mr. Heppner and some of his fellow board directors at Beneficient ramped up GWG's bond sales after taking over that company's board as well. They sent some of the proceeds to Beneficient and then carved Beneficient out as an independent firm less than five months before GWG went bankrupt.</p><p>In a legal motion filed last week in GWG's chapter 11 case, lawyers representing bondholders accused Mr. Heppner of causing the company to funnel hundreds of millions of dollars to Beneficient despite the firm's \"persistent failure to develop a viable business plan or come even remotely close to meeting any of its fanciful projections.\"</p><p>A Beneficient spokesman said that the legal motion is full of \"baseless accusations, egregious errors and various distortions pertaining to the Beneficient-GWG relationship.\"</p><p>GWG continues to face the investigation by the SEC, which has issued the company at least 16 subpoenas, including for information about its transactions with Beneficient, as well as GWG's accounting and valuation practices while it was consolidated with Beneficient.</p><p>The accounting method that GWG and Beneficient used made revenues seem higher than they really were, securities filings show. It resulted in obscuring the extent of investment losses in Beneficient's alternative asset portfolio, such as when a healthcare venture that had made up roughly a fifth of the portfolio went bust in 2020, The Wall Street Journal found.</p><p>Beneficient also used management's expectations of demand for its services to peg the firm's equity value at $2.2 billion even when its alternative asset portfolio had shrunk to roughly a 10th of that, according to documents reviewed by the Journal, people familiar with the matter and public securities filings.</p><p>Mr. Heppner said in an interview that Beneficient's business model is unique and its accounting was a genuinely complex issue. He added that GWG voluntarily went to the SEC asking for guidance about Beneficient's accounting issues.</p><p>GWG's efforts to fund Beneficient repeatedly spurred disputes with board directors who were uncomfortable about putting money from retail investors into the firm, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>After three directors out of 10 resigned on the same day last year, GWG made a securities filing that said their resignations weren't due to any disagreement with the company. However, those directors resigned because they objected to a proposed transaction for GWG to invest additional money into Beneficient, according to a restated filing GWG's new management made last month.</p><p>GWG made its initial statements about the resignations at a time when the company was already under SEC investigation. Michael Stamer, a lawyer representing GWG bondholders, said at a bankruptcy hearing last month that those statements were false and that the prior GWG management made them \"to facilitate further funding by GWG of Beneficient.\"</p><p>Mr. Heppner said: \"I have always worked to maintain best-in-class governance and transparency, consistent with my fiduciary duties as a director. I always relied on the counsel of independent advisors and attorneys when in the boardroom.\"</p><p>Mr. Heppner started his career as an intern at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. before going on to build and sell a series of asset-management and financial-services businesses. His latest venture, Beneficient, combined with GWG through a complex, three-way merger that began in 2017 and involved private-equity firm Paul Capital, from which Beneficient acquired its core portfolio of alternative assets. In 2019, GWG's board was replaced by a slate of directors designated by Beneficient, and Mr. Heppner became GWG's chairman in addition to his role as chairman and CEO of Beneficient.</p><p>For years, GWG sold financial instruments called L Bonds, which pooled money from bond investors to purchase life-insurance policies. After the merger, GWG amended its bond prospectus to say that instead of being used to buy more insurance policies, a significant portion of the bondholders' money would instead go toward growing exposure to alternative assets by making investments in Beneficient along with repaying some previous L Bond investors.</p><p>GWG sold more than $1 billion of bonds after that change in strategy, and roughly half of those bonds were sold after the company filed financial statements later found by the SEC to be incorrect. While much of the proceeds went toward repaying earlier L Bond investors, Beneficient received at least $230 million from GWG, which still owns a non-controlling stake in the firm.</p><p>Many of Beneficient's directors, executives and employees thought that the firm would primarily use the money it received from GWG to expand the business by conducting new alternative asset financings, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Instead, Beneficient in 2019 and 2020 paid $144.6 million in principal and interest on debt held by a financial trust associated with Mr. Heppner and his family, as well as made payments to other business entities affiliated with him, according to people familiar with the matter and public filings.</p><p>The Beneficient spokesman said that \"GWG's repayment of the pre-existing senior secured debt to the senior lender associated with Mr. Heppner and his affiliates was intended to help increase investors' exposure to the underlying assets.\"</p><p>GWG's annual report for 2019 said that Beneficient's primary asset was a book of loans receivable made to unaffiliated trusts. The trusts' ultimate beneficiaries are local communities in Kansas, a condition for Beneficient to receive its trust-bank charter from that state. The charitable trusts, established by Beneficient, use loans provided by the firm to acquire alternative assets, and then pay Beneficient income from the returns generated by those assets.</p><p>For three successive quarters in 2020, GWG said that Beneficient's revenues from those loans grew substantially from the same period a year earlier.</p><p>According to a person familiar with the matter, the purpose of the intercompany loan structure is because Beneficient wanted certain benefits of being a regulated bank while pursuing a business model tied to alternative assets.</p><p>In July 2021, the SEC determined that Beneficient had been incorrectly accounting for the charitable trusts. Because of Beneficient's economic interest in them, they should have been accounted for as the firm's consolidated subsidiaries, not as unaffiliated trusts. This meant that in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the loans to the subsidiaries should have been eliminated for accounting purposes, and that Beneficient shouldn't have counted the interest and fee income it received from them as revenue. GWG and Beneficient had to restate their financial results, deleting certain revenues they previously reported they had received.</p><p>The restated filings showed that over the first six months of 2020, Beneficient's alternative asset portfolio had actually incurred negative revenues due to losses on investments, when the firm had previously reported it had received interest and fee revenue from the portfolio during that time. GWG's total revenue for that period was 49% less than in the incorrect filings, while its net loss was 68% greater.</p><p>The Beneficient spokesman said that while net losses for that six-month period were greater in the restated filings, those losses were mostly absorbed by the charitable trusts, and he noted that the restatement's impact on the net loss attributable to GWG's common shareholders was negligible.</p><p>The restated filings also showed that Beneficient's investments in alternative assets had declined to $222 million by the end of 2020, down from $342 million at the end of 2019 and down from more than $700 million in 2018.</p><p>According to people familiar with the matter, the decrease in value over that time was because certain assets matured, other assets were swapped out for GWG securities, and because the venture that had made up roughly a fifth of the portfolio, Proteus Digital Health Inc., went bankrupt in 2020.</p><p>GWG used a valuation study conducted by Ankura Consulting Group LLC to report to investors that Beneficient's equity was worth $2.2 billion at the end of 2019, based on management's expectation of future growth, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>A separate analysis prepared by the firm Valuation Research Corp. for a special committee of GWG directors found that Beneficient's equity was worth $477 million to $1.3 billion at the end of 2019, assuming the company hit its earnings projections.</p><p>At the time, Beneficient projected that revenues would reach at least $160 million in 2020, at least $400 million in 2021 and more than $1.7 billion annually by 2025, according to documents reviewed by the Journal.</p><p>Beneficient missed its projections, yet the $2.2 billion equity valuation figure, reported as an intangible goodwill asset on GWG's balance sheet, wasn't written down.</p><p>Dave Hart, a GWG investor, said at a court hearing earlier this month that he didn't see how Beneficient could be valued at more than 6 times the value of its portfolio. The lawyers for L bondholders said in their legal motion last week that the goodwill figure misleadingly suggested that GWG had adequate collateral supporting the L Bonds.</p><p>The Beneficient spokesman said that the valuation figures that GWG used were in line with the analyses compiled by other valuation agents for the company.</p><p>The estimated value of GWG's interests in Beneficient enabled GWG in 2020 and 2021 to avoid violating a covenant requiring its debt-to-asset ratio not to exceed 90%, which would have forced it to stop selling L Bonds earlier.</p><p>GWG's bond sales ceased for good and the company defaulted on them this January after the SEC told broker-dealers they would be investigated if they sold any more L Bonds.</p><p>In September, Beneficient announced an agreement to go public via a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company.</p><p>Write to Alexander Gladstone at alexander.gladstone@wsj.com</p><p>Financial Firm Beneficient Pushed Boundaries Before Bond Program's Collapse</p>",
