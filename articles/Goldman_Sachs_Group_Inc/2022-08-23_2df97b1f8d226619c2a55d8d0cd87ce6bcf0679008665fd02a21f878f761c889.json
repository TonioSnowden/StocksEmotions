  "text": "<p>In Florida, U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist and state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried are battling for the Democratic nomination for governor and the right to take on incumbent Gov. Ron DeSantis, a rising Republican star. The candidates have been debating who is best suited for that uphill battle and, in the wake of the Supreme Court decision eliminating a constitutional right to abortion, who would be the most effective advocate for abortion rights.</p><p>In a Senate primary, Democratic Rep. Val Demings is expected to win the party's nomination to run against Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. She is the top fundraiser in a primary that includes Brian Rush, a former state lawmaker, and lawyer William Sanchez.</p><p>New Yorkers will cast ballots in two special elections for the U.S. House as well as in primary elections for Congress and the state Senate. All New York primaries were originally scheduled for June 28, but the congressional and state Senate contests were moved to August after a judge struck down Democrat-drawn district lines.</p><p>There is no tradition of August voting in the state, and its early voting numbers are lagging behind the June primary, when primaries for governor, lieutenant governor and state Assembly took place.</p><p>In the Hudson Valley's 19th District, Republican Marc Molinaro and Democrat Pat Ryan are seeking to fill the term of ex-Rep. Antonio Delgado in a race that is seen as a tossup.</p><p>Mr. Ryan, the Ulster County executive, aired ads touting his support for abortion access after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in July. Mr. Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, said abortion policy should be left to states and has said he personally opposes abortion.</p><p>Both also campaigned on inflation and the cost of living. Mr. Molinaro highlighted the rise in prices under President Biden and said Democrats' tax, healthcare and climate package signed into law last week would do little to curb inflation. Mr. Ryan supports that measure.</p><p>The seat opened up when Gov. Kathy Hochul appointed Mr. Delgado as lieutenant governor when the previous holder of that office, Brian Benjamin, resigned after he was charged in an alleged bribery scheme. Mr. Benjamin has pleaded not guilty.</p><p>The other special election is to serve out the end of the term of former GOP Rep. Tom Reed, who canceled his re-election efforts after apologizing for inappropriate sexual conduct and later resigned to take a job at a government-relations firm. In the red-leaning district, Republican Joe Sempolinski is vying with Democrat Max Della Pia, who is also running in the November general election for the term starting next year.</p><p>Mr. Sempolinski, if he wins, will serve about four months as he isn't running for the next full term. In his absence, Republicans Nick Langworthy and Carl Paladino are battling for the GOP line in a heated contest where both candidates have expressed their long ties to former President Donald Trump, though he hasn't made an endorsement in the race.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What are you watching for in this week's primaries? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Mr. Langworthy chairs the state Republican Party but is seeking elected office for the first time. Mr. Paladino, a real-estate developer, was the GOP's 2010 gubernatorial candidate after he harnessed tea party support for an unexpected primary victory over the party-endorsed candidate. He lost in the general election.</p><p>In New York City, Democrats have poured their energy into primary contests for the 10th and 12th districts. Longtime Reps. Nadler and Maloney found themselves facing off when they were drawn together in the 12th District, which includes Midtown Manhattan and residential areas surrounding Central Park. Suraj Patel, a lawyer who has previously challenged Ms. Maloney, is also running.</p><p>Mr. Jones was also impacted by redistricting. The freshman Democrat scrapped plans to seek re-election from his Westchester County home when a more senior member, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, said he would run there. Mr. Maloney, who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, faces a primary challenge from state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi, who is running with the support of the progressive Working Families Party.</p><p>Mr. Jones is now running in a crowded Democratic primary to represent the redrawn 10th District, which covers lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn and had no incumbent. The other candidates include Dan Goldman, a prosecutor who led the first House impeachment of Mr. Trump; state Assembly members Jo Anne Simon and Yuh-Line Niou; city councilwoman Carlina Rivera and former Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman. Former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is also on the ballot, but he ended his campaign last month.</p><p>Mr. Goldman, an heir to the Levi Strauss &amp; Co. fortune, has lent his campaign several million dollars and has outspent his rivals. Ms. Holtzman touted her experience as a trailblazerâ€”after serving in Congress from 1973 to 1981, she was elected district attorney in Brooklyn and later city comptroller. Ms. Rivera has won the backing of several major unions, and Ms. Niou is supported by the WFP.</p><p>Separately, in Oklahoma, Republican Rep. Markwayne Mullin and T.W. Shannon, the former GOP speaker of the state House of Representatives, are facing each other in a runoff primary race for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate. </p><p>Democrat Pat Ryan is running for Congress in New York's Hudson Valley in two different districts. PHOTO: Adam T. Deen for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>The winner will take on former Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn in a special election this fall to fill the remainder of retiring Sen. Jim Inhofe's term. Mr. Inhofe, who plans to retire in early January, was elected to a six-year term in 2020. The Republican victor Tuesday night is highly favored to carry the deep-red state in November.</p><p>Separately, Oklahoma Democrats will choose between Madison Horn and Jason Bollinger to be their candidate against incumbent Republican Sen. James Lankford in the fall.</p><p>Arian Campo-Flores contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jimmy Vielkind at Jimmy.Vielkind@wsj.com and Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson+1@wsj.com</p><p>New York Primaries See Democrats Fight for Redistricted Seats</p>",
