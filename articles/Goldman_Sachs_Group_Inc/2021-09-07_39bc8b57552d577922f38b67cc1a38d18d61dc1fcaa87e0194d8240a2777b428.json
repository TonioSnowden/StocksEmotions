The reading broadly matches economists expectations polled by The Wall Street Journal. (Dow Jones Newswires)</p><p>The Eurozone services sector continued to expand at a strong pace in August, as the final reading for the currency region's services PMI came in at 59.0. The reading is below a 59.7 preliminary estimate and July's 59.8. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity. Below this threshold signals contraction.
