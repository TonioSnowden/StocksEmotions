  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>The apparent synergies between private equity and what was once referred to as “the military-industrial complex” may soon be on display in upcoming cabinet confirmation hearings in Washington DC. Absurdities surrounding the certification of Joe Biden as the next US president will soon be over. Attention will then shift to the appointments he makes. Some of those picks — notably Antony Blinken as prospective secretary of state — are already sparking controversy. </p> <p>Former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen has been tapped to lead the US Treasury. Ms Yellen, a respected technocrat, was supposed to be a unity pick bridging the divide between progressives and moderates. But last week we learned how she has been spending some of her time since President Donald Trump declined to keep her on in 2017. Her financial disclosures revealed that she had made millions of dollars in speaking fees visiting the likes of <a href=\"https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/C22B882BBDC40AC78525864F008106AB/$FILE/Yellen,%20Janet%20L.%20final%20278.pdf\">Citigroup and Google</a>, sometimes at $200,000 a pop (her very own personal stimulus programme).&#xa0;</p> <p>These revelations caused <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenWhitehouse/status/1346137327345799169\">consternation</a>. Yet Ms Yellen in her public service never demonstrated any particular allegiance to moneyed interests. She likely reasoned that after her Fed tenure ended, her days of government service were over. Easy-money speeches are so far <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c33a0fa-6556-4be2-8b59-e454aee5579e\">down the scale</a> of possible corruption in America that she's likely to skate into office.&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>A more intriguing appointment is that of Mr Blinken, a longtime foreign policy operative who has been nominated as Mr Biden's secretary of state. Mr Blinken was always considered to be on the short list and was the rare member of “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/magazine/the-aspiring-novelist-who-became-obamas-foreign-policy-guru.html\">the Blob</a>”, as the political elite is known, who could be acceptable to sceptical leftists.</p> <p>The wild card for him may be how he has spent the past four years in “the swamp”. Mr Blinken's various entanglements became clearer on New Year's Eve when his financial disclosure forms were publicly released. They revealed a breakneck private sector bonanza. He co-founded a consulting company WestExec Advisors, whose tagline is “Bringing the Situation Room to the Board Room”. <a href=\"https://westexec.com/\">The website </a>even features an action photo of Mr Blinken and President Barack Obama sitting in the White House having a conversation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/DB768AE135A5BA8C8525864F008104D6/$FILE/Blinken,%20Antony%20%20final%20278.pdf\">His disclosure form</a> listed WestExec clients such as Blackstone, Lazard, Microsoft, Facebook, SoftBank, McKinsey and Uber, among others. According to its website, WestExec features a “diverse group of senior national security professionals with the most recent experience at the highest levels of the US government” that has “unparalleled perspective to help our clients manage risk and achieve their goals”.</p> <p>All this consulting may, in fact, be high-minded but the descriptions remain intentionally nebulous. These companies are all trying to build businesses in edgy parts of the world. Insiders such as Mr Blinken possess specialised knowledge and relationships that can be useful to those who can afford to pay up. It may be unseemly but it is not necessarily improper or illegal.</p> <p>Mr Blinken wants to seamlessly shuffle back from his private enterprises to the highest echelons of public service now that his longtime friend Mr Biden has assumed power. The issue is what exactly was he doing for clients and whether that impairs his ability to pursue the interests of the US fairly.</p> <p>Mr Blinken is not just a consultant, but an investor too. WestExec has affiliates WestExec Capital Partners and WestExec Ventures. Separately, Mr Blinken has been affiliated with a private equity firm, Pine Island Capital Partners. Pine Island divides its team among “investment team partners” which feature the former Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch bigwig John Thain and&#xa0;“DC partners” whose ranks include former senators, generals and diplomats such as Mr Blinken. </p> <p>Pine Island has two portfolio companies. One sells live-fire training systems and the other makes components for defence contractors. Pine Island <a href=\"https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-20-124750/\">recently launched</a> its own special purpose acquisition company. Mr Blinken, according to his disclosures, also has a stake in Social Capital, the venture capital fund of the ubiquitous financier Chamath Palihapitiya.</p> <p>After the exhaustion of the Trump era, there is a desperation for normalcy. In this sense, Mr Blinken, Ms Yellen and several other Biden nominees coming straight from Wall Street, Silicon Valley, a big law firm or a transcontinental consulting firm is not just normalcy but a return to business as usual. Whether it is the kind of normalcy ordinary Americans should embrace is another question.</p> <p>Enjoy the rest of your week,</p> <p><strong>Sujeet Indap</strong><br><em>US Lex editor</em></p><p>Source: Sujeet Indap 2021 'Lex letter from New York: jobs for the Blob' FT.com 6 January.
