  "title": "U.S. News: New York Rep.-Elect Santos Admits Lying",
  "text": "<p>The interviews come after a story in the New York Times earlier this month noted the discrepancies in his resume.</p><p>\"I didn't graduate from any institution of higher learning. I'm embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my resume,\" Mr. Santos, 34 years old, told the Post. \"I own up to that . . . We do stupid things in life.\"</p><p>\"I am not a criminal,\" Mr. Santos added. \"This [controversy] will not deter me from having good legislative success. I will be effective. I will be good.\"</p><p>An archived version of Mr. Santos's former campaign website said he attended Baruch College in Manhattan and \"in 2010 graduated with a bachelor's in economics and finance.\"</p><p>The same campaign biography said he \"began working at Citigroup as an associate and quickly advanced to become an associate asset manager in the real asset division of the firm.\" According to that biography, he\"was then offered an exciting opportunity with Goldman Sachs.\"</p><p>Mr. Santos acknowledged in the interview with the New York Post that he \"never worked directly\" for Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, saying he had made a \"poor choice of words.\"</p><p>Mr. Santos said in the interview that a company called LinkBridge Investors, where he worked as a vice president, did business with the two Wall Street firms.</p><p>Democrats have said the discrepancies, as well as additional questions about Mr. Santos's finances, should be looked at before Mr. Santos is set to be seated when a new House is sworn in on Jan. 3. The Supreme Court has said that the House can only prevent candidates from taking office if they violate the Constitution's age, citizenship and state residency requirements.</p><p>Mr. Santos last month defeated Robert Zimmerman, a Democratic National Committee member, by 8 percentage points in New York's redrawn Third Congressional District, which contains parts of Northeastern Queens and North Shore of Long Island.</p><p>Rep. Tom Suozzi, the incumbent Democrat, didn't seek re-election; he unsuccessfully ran for governor.</p><p>Republicans outperformed expectations in most New York suburbs on their way to winning a House majority. Once a new Congress is seated on Jan. 3, they will hold a narrow 222-212 majority in the House with one vacancy.</p>",
