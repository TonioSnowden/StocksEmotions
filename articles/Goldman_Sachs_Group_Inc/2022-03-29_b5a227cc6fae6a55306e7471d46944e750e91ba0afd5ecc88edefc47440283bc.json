  "text": "<p>Steven Mnuchin's private equity group has made its first buyout since he stepped down as US Treasury secretary in the Trump administration, taking a controlling interest in mobile cyber security company Zimperium for $525mn. </p> <p>Liberty Strategic Capital, Mnuchin's firm, has focused on cyber security with four minority investments since its launch last year. Mnuchin raised $2.5bn from a group of backers that included <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24da1d88-8e63-4868-849f-3e3ecff1c39a\">Japan's SoftBank</a>, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala. <br><br>Zimperium, founded by two Israeli security experts, provides companies with technology to stop criminals from hacking the mobile devices of their employees to obtain sensitive information.</p> <p>The Dallas-based company has <a href=\"https://blog.zimperium.com/pegasus-mobile-spyware-used-to-target-journalists-activists-and-more/\">claimed</a> that it is capable of thwarting mobile attacks such as the one carried out by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b4ad167b-cb3a-4e0b-a6a0-bb2608679721\">NSO Group's Pegasus</a>, the Israeli military-grade spyware manufacturer that created software to trace the phones of journalists and human rights activists around the world.</p> <p>“It's clear that mobile is the new front line for cyber security,” Mnuchin said. “We believe Zimperium has positioned itself as the leader in securing mobile endpoints and applications.”</p> <p>Prior to joining Donald Trump's administration, Mnuchin worked for several years on Wall Street, climbing to the top ranks of investment bank Goldman Sachs. </p> <p>He left Goldman in 2002 and later launched hedge fund Dune Capital Management and a film studio called Dune Entertainment. Following the 2008 financial crisis, he went on to turn round failed California-based lender IndyMac, which was later acquired by CIT Group for $3.4bn.</p> <p>Mnuchin was not the first Treasury secretary to have previously worked at an investment bank. Many have also left government to join the lucrative world of private equity buyouts. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e0adf58-8ee2-11dc-87ee-0000779fd2ac\">John Snow</a>, who served under President George W Bush, moved to Cerberus Capital Management, while Tim Geithner, Barack Obama's first Treasury secretary, is president of Warburg Pincus, which will sell its stake in Zimperium.</p> <p>Jack Lew, Obama's second Treasury secretary, is a managing partner at private equity group Lindsay Goldberg, and Hank Paulson, who also served under Bush, is executive chair of a climate investment fund at TPG.</p><p>Source: James Fontanella-Khan and Antoine Gara in New York 2022 'Steven Mnuchin's private equity group buys cyber security company' FT.com 29 March.
