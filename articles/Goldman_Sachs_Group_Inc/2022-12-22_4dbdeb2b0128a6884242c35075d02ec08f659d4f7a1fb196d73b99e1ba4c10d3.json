  "title": "The Computers Driving the Oil Market Get Fresh Scrutiny; After a year of wild swings, traders are studying trend-following funds",
  "text": "<p>It has been a tough year for oil traders. Even the computers haven't been able to get it right consistently.</p><p>Wall Street is closely tracking firms that use trend-following algorithms to trade oil futures, which profited mightily from betting on higher prices as crude climbed to more than $120 per barrel this spring. But with oil falling bumpily since June, the trend-followers have waffled between bullish and bearish wagers and given some of those profits back.</p><p>Analysts are blaming them for amplifying oil's wild price swings. Traders are monitoring them to steer clear of the waves they make in the market. Investors are mimicking them for profit. And this year's oil-price roller-coaster ride is putting their logic to the test.</p><p>Recent research from Goldman Sachs cited so-called commodity trading advisers for intensifying a recent five-week slide in which oil dropped nearly 23%. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, landed at a recent low around $79 a barrel, close to where it started the year.</p><p>Commodity trading adviser, or CTA, is industry jargon for a hedge fund that uses computer algorithms to divine and follow price trends, typically by comparing recent prices to their average over a previous period. Despite their name, CTAs trade futures on currencies, stocks, and bonds in addition to commodities such as oil.</p><p>Like previous ones, \"the most recent selloff, has also been associated with substantial CTA liquidations,\" says Daniel Ghali, senior commodities strategist at TD Securities.</p><p>While stocks and bonds have tumbled this year,CTAs have posted returns exceeding 18%. They have thrived by betting on gains in the U.S. dollar and in bond yields, which were propelled higher by the postpandemic recovery and the Fed's fight against inflation, and in commodity prices, which skyrocketed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>But commodities may be particularly apt targets for trend-following due to theirsusceptibility to boom-and-bust price cyclesâ€”and because their long-term appreciation may be threatened by innovation, substitution and conservation.</p><p>TD Securities estimates that 30% of commodities futures trading flow is from CTAs. Mr. Ghali said that number \"dramatically understates\" their influence on price changes taking place over days or weeks since, he estimates, another 50% comes from high-frequency trading algorithms that enter and exit trades too quickly to affect prices over those time scales.</p><p>CTAs and other investors provide beneficial liquidity and balance to the oil market, since far more oil is sold via futures and other derivatives by oil producers looking to hedge their exposure than is bought by consumers such as airlines doing the opposite. Investors bridge the divide.</p><p>\"Oil has been a very strong, positive contributor,\" to CTA performance, since the advent of fracking for shale oil hit prices hard in 2014, says Chad Martinson, CIO of Efficient Capital Management, which allocates $2.5 billion of investor assets to 25 CTAs. The energy subsector is the biggest contributor to his fund's 24% returns this year.</p><p>Oil traders who live by their wits in lieu of algorithms nonetheless pay companies such as Bridgeton Research Group for intel on CTAs that could lessen the likelihood they will buy just before CTAs sell and lower prices, or vice versa.</p><p>\"We look ahead, almost like a radar,\" says Stephen Roseme, Bridgeton's co-founder. \"If you're driving an F1 car, you want to know that there's some water ahead on the road.\"</p><p>Bridgeton runs its own trend-following algorithm that imitates the CTAs. Their model estimates they sold about 85 million barrels worth of Brent futures during their recent five-week rout, and suggests that nearly 30% of those sales occurred the same day Brent took its biggest hit, of $3.33 on December 6.</p><p>\"When everybody is on the same side of the boat, it is a sizable position in the market,\" says Jerry Prior, COO and portfolio manager at Mount Lucas Management LP, a CTA that is up about 27% this year.</p><p>Prior's algorithm began buying crude in 2021, held a maximally long oil position going into the war in Ukraine, but didn't start selling until September, even though prices had been sinking since June. His fund is now short oil, consistent with Bridgeton's assessment of CTAs overall.</p><p>\"It's been a little interesting,\" on the way down, Mr. Prior says. But he also considers his algorithm's reluctance to cash out of winning trades more quickly a feature not a bug.</p><p>\"Human nature wants you to get out of that trade earlier,\" he said. Still, he added, it is the all-too-human propensity to cling to past gains that will \"eat your lunch\" by making you trade too much.</p><p>Algorithms \"don't care about headlines. They don't care about losing their year. They don't care about explaining to clients why they used to be long something and now they're short something,\" says Andrew Beer, managing member of Dynamic Beta Investments and co-portfolio manager of the iMGP DBi Managed Futures Strategy exchange-traded fund.</p><p>While some pros are surveilling CTA flows to trade around them, Beer's firm profits by piggybacking on them. Each day, it estimates the average positions of the 20 largest CTAs with a statistical model that compares their recent profits and losses to the price changes of 10 of the most highly traded futures contracts. The iMGP DBi Managed Futures Strategy ETF, which holds those estimated positions, is up about 20% this year.</p><p>But the fourth quarter hasn't been kind to the CTAs. The trends that powered their performance earlier this year have largely petered out resulting in a pullback in profits. Despite oil's outsize contribution to their bottom lines, Bridgeton's modeling suggests the CTAs have been losing on their oil trades since May, in part from holding on to bullish bets even as prices declined, and because severe volatility has tricked their algorithms into a few false starts.</p><p>\"We're now in a period of uncertainty,\" says Mr. Roheme. \"These funds are looking for direction, but not seeing it.\"</p><p>A closer look at Bridgeton's estimates of CTA selling during oil's recent five-week slide suggests that the bulk of their sales occurred in the days following drops, rather than at the same time. So, while traders are eyeing the algorithms, the algorithms are looking right back.</p><p>\"It's called trend-following,\" says Mount Lucas's Mr. Prior. \"The key word there is 'follow'.\"</p><p>Write to Bob Henderson at bob.henderson@wsj.com</p><p>The Computers Driving the Oil Market Get Fresh Scrutiny</p>",
