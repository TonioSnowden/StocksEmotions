  "text": "<p>As Goldman Sachs' economists now think rate hikes in the U.K. will start in May 2022 — ahead of the U.S. and the eurozone — bonds yields should continue to rise. Already, the U.K. 10-year BX:TMBMKGB-10Y has outgained U.S. BX:TMUBMUSD10Yand European BX:TMBMKDE-10Yrivals, with an 80 basis point rise this year.</p><p>Goldman's strategists say banks and value in general have room to catch up. Banks trade at a 35% discount to the market, as well as a discount to their own historical valuations, and it says the average upside is 52% for the U.K. banks it rates as buy: HSBC UK:HSBA, Barclays UK:BARC, NatWest UK:NWG and Standard Chartered UK:STAN.</p><p>The FTSE 100 UK:UKX on Friday drifted 0.6% lower to 7,044.68. Lloyds UK:LLOYpaced the decline, with the U.K. focused bank losing 3%.</p><p>Pub chain J.D. Wetherspoon UK:JDW was the highest profile company reporting results, as it lost £154.7 million before tax in the July 25-ending year, before exceptional items, as like-for-like sales tumbled 38%. It said it was hard to find staff in the “staycation” areas in the West Country and elsewhere. Wetherspoon shares edged up 0.7%, to trim this year's losses to 6%.</p>",
