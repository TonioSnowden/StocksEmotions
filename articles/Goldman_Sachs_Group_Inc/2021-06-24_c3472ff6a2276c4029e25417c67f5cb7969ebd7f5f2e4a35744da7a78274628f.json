  "title": "Business News:  NFL Looks  At Options  For Media  Properties  ----  By Joe Flint",
  "text": "<p>   The National Football League is exploring options for its media properties including selling stakes to strategic partners, a move aimed at expanding the reach of its television networks and digital services, the league told team owners in a letter on Wednesday. </p><p>   The league said it has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to explore potential partnerships for the properties, which include the NFL Network and RedZone pay-TV channels as well as NFL.com. </p><p>   The decision to seek partners is motivated by the league's belief that its TV and digital holdings will benefit from being aligned with bigger media and technology companies rather than remaining stand-alone operations, league and team officials said. </p><p>   \"As the whole world of communications and digital media changes, we want to find a partner who can further help us maximize the reach and potential the NFL assets represent,\" New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft said in an interview. Mr. Kraft is chair of the league's media committee. </p><p>   League and team officials stressed that they aren't looking to sell the networks, and said the NFL will maintain control of them. </p><p>   \"We are not selling. We are looking for investment partners,\" Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said in an interview. </p><p>   Mr. Jones is a member of the league's media committee and chairman of the owned and operated media committee, which includes the NFL Network and RedZone. </p><p>   In its letter to team owners, the league said it is aiming to create \"an even more dynamic media asset that extends reach and engagement and creates additional value for the clubs -- including through direct-to-consumer opportunities, new and innovative content and formats, and international expansion.\" </p><p>   In a memo to staff, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said the league has \"a number of rights and assets to support the future growth of our business\" including live games, tentpole events such as the NFL draft and \"a myriad of opportunities around legalized sports betting.\" </p><p>   While there is no firm timetable for the hunt for potential partners, the commissioner said the process would likely run into and potentially through the 2021 NFL season. </p><p></p>",
