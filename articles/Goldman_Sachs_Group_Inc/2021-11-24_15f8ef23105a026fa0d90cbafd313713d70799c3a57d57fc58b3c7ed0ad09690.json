  "title": "Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan to Compensate Hong Kong Staff for Quarantine Expenses; Firms will provide about $5,000 to cover city's mandatory hotel stays when employees return from visiting family",
  "text": "<p>Morgan Stanley said in a memo on Wednesday that it would provide a one-time payment of up to the equivalent of about $5,130 for staff returning to Hong Kong after visiting family members overseas. The U.S. company said the program would begin next month and end next November.</p><p>JPMorgan said last week that it was rolling out a similar plan. The U.S. bank said staff at the executive director level or below can claim up to $5,000 for a single quarantine stay in Hong Kong's quarantine hotels after trips to see family.</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is considering various options for its employees in Asia that need to travel and quarantine upon their return, a spokesman said Wednesday.</p><p>The expatriate business community in the financial hub has been calling for authorities to ease border restrictions, which have prevented many people from visiting family, clients or colleagues abroad.</p><p>A Hong Kong resident returning to the city from places deemed high-risk such as the U.S. or U.K. is subject to mandatory quarantine for 21 days at a designated hotel. A $5,000 subsidy would cover most of the cost of a stay in one of Hong Kong's higher-end designated quarantine hotels, such as the Kerry, where three-week quarantine packages start at about $4,900.</p><p>The strict border controls in Hong Kong and mainland China are creating staffing challenges, Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon said last week.</p><p>The Asia Securities Industry &amp; Financial Markets Association, a group representing some of the world's biggest banks, urged the Hong Kong government last month to consider more-open borders. In an open letter, the lobby group said that 48% of the companies it surveyed are considering moving staff or operations out of Hong Kong because of quarantine restrictions and that 73% were experiencing difficulty attracting and retaining talent in Hong Kong.</p><p>JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who visited Hong Kong last week, was able to skip quarantine. He arrived days after Hong Kong tightened its rules to remove quarantine exemptions for certain travelers, including top international financial executives.</p><p>Write to Frances Yoon at frances.yoon@wsj.com</p><p>Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan to Compensate Hong Kong Staff for Quarantine Expenses</p>",
