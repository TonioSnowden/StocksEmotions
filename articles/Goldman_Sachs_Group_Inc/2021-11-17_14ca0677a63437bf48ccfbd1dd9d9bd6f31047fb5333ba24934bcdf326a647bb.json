  "title": "New Jersey Weighs $1.5 Billion in Credit Bets Managed by Goldman Sachs; The state pension system is considering an increase in private credit investments through two separately managed accounts",
  "text": "<p>Both commitments would \"accelerate exposure to the private-credit asset class\" for the pension system and ease a restructuring of its private-credit holdings, according to Jared Speicher, the division's head of private equity and private credit.</p><p>The system is currently trailing its allocation targets for the strategy, according to a memo about the proposed investments by Shoaib Khan, the division's acting director and chief investment officer. He said that a commitment to syndicated loans could be fully deployed within two months rather than the 18 to 36 months it would take to fully invest money placed in a more traditional drawdown fund.</p><p>Mr. Speicher told pension trustees that the separately managed account for syndicated loans would provide \"a risk-return profile consistent with private-credit but with liquidity measured in weeks rather than quarters or years.\"</p><p>The proposed $1 billion commitment for the syndicated-loan strategy, which targets investments in below-investment-grade senior secured or first-lien loans, would follow the division's $1 billion pledge in July to PGIM Inc., a Prudential Financial Inc. company, for a similar syndicated-loan strategy, according to Mr. Speicher.</p><p>The division would muster the capital for the syndicated loan account with the Goldman asset management arm by drawing it from lower-yielding investments in cash equivalents and treasuries, where the pension is currently overweight, Mr. Khan indicated in the memo. The documents say that assuming the $1 billion is fully invested through the proposed account, the estimated annualized yield improvement would surpass $40 million compared with cash and government bonds.</p><p>The separately managed account would invest in floating-rate debt and target 6% returns, with leverage levels of as much as 75% of loan values, Mr. Speicher said.</p><p>\"Practically everything is [a] floating rate, so there is no duration risk,\" with rising inflation and interest rates, Bill Connors, the division's head of income, said at the meeting.</p><p>More than half of the $500 million separately managed private-credit account would target first-lien debt of sponsor-led midmarket companies, Mr. Connors said. Another 30% would be used to pursue an opportunistic strategy managed by Goldman's hybrid capital division and the rest would focus on mezzanine, senior credit or specialty lending strategies.</p><p>Taken together, the vehicle's blended net leverage returns would be targeted at 11% to 13%, Mr. Connors said. The account would start out with 30 to 40 existing loans made with Goldman's balance-sheet capital, so as much as half the committed funds could be invested at closing, he said.</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com</p>",
