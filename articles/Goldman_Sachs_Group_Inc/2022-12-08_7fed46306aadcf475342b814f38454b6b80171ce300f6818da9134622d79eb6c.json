  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start: </strong>Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b0601e2-d371-404d-8531-227f11d4a83f\">reached the late stages</a> of negotiating a sponsorship deal worth more than $100mn with Taylor Swift, but talks with the pop star fizzled out just months before the exchange's collapse in November.</p> <p><strong>In today's newsletter:</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p>Bluebell vs Fink</p></li>  <li><p>European tech start-ups lose steam</p></li> </ul> <h1>Bluebell goes right for the jugular</h1> <p>Old-school activist investors tend to have a similar playbook: pick a public company that is underperforming, acquire a sizeable stake and call for changes to be made to improve its stock price. </p> <p>It's not often that they pick one of the most successful companies in the world and ask for one of the most well-regarded investors to step down from the top job. </p> <p>But that's exactly what <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3bc02801-732d-46a2-b640-ad91c5b5dc24\"><strong>Bluebell Capital Partners</strong> has done</a> with <strong>BlackRock</strong> and its chief<strong> Larry Fink</strong>. </p> <p>The European activist is calling for Fink's head over the “apparent hypocrisy” of the asset manager's use of environmental, social and governance investment factors. </p> <p>Before we go any further on this, let's get the obvious out of the way: Fink isn't going anywhere, at least not because of this. </p> <p>Bluebell has a 0.01 per cent stake in BlackRock, which has a market capitalisation of $107bn. The activist has made some interesting points, though.</p> <p>We've talked before about how tiny managers have been tackling bigger and bigger fish, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebfdf67d-cbce-40a5-bb29-d361377dea7a\">primary example being</a> <strong>Engine No. 1</strong> going after <strong>Exxon</strong>, typically by getting larger shareholders involved. But it's difficult to imagine any major BlackRock investors calling for Fink's resignation. </p> <p>And while Bluebell has successfully punched above its weight before — it's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e7ae718-eb18-4d2f-bd18-59e6349540f2\">best known</a> for helping dethrone a chief executive at <strong>Danone</strong> last year despite holding less than €20mn in shares and having total assets of €70mn — BlackRock, with its whopping $8tn assets, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7dfd1e3d-e256-4656-a96d-1204538d75cd\">is a whole other beast</a>.</p> <p>Bluebell has touched on something though. BlackRock is getting grief from both sides of the sustainability debate: Democratic officials are complaining that the company hasn't gone far enough in its support to reduce carbon emissions while Republicans in several states have pulled money out of BlackRock funds for being hostile to fossil fuel companies. </p> <p>In its letter to BlackRock, Bluebell stated that “the reputational damage of being dragged into this politically charged debate, in our view, is very significant because it calls into question the independency of BlackRock as an asset manager.”</p> <p>BlackRock's ESG status has come into serious question since<strong> Tariq Fancy</strong>, the firm's former sustainability boss, wrote several notes attacking its ESG agenda. But it seems like there's something deeper going on here. </p> <p>Bluebell's frustrated that BlackRock didn't support its position on environmental shareholder resolutions at other companies, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5781b305-3547-4fc8-b5a1-0c6b8e4c862f\">such as <strong>Glencore</strong></a> and <strong>Solvay</strong>, and has decided to go after the world's largest asset manager itself. </p> <h1>Europe runs low on unicorns</h1> <p>The year is 2020. In a signal of confidence in the Swedish streaming group and its European tech peers, <strong>Spotify</strong> boss <strong>Daniel Ek </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aad03856-986b-472d-b7f3-0409da6add55\">pledges to invest</a> €1bn in early-stage “moonshots” that may be “too early” for most venture capital firms. </p> <p>He may now be wishing he'd stayed on Earth. More than $400bn in market value has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac0805f2-292e-4e7c-8d2d-bec5af9c4577\">wiped from European tech groups</a> since the peak of the 2021 boom, as venture capital dealmaking has caved to the pressures of high inflation, rising interest rates and the war in Ukraine.</p> <p>Ek wasn't alone in his ambitions to take on Silicon Valley. Europe's start-ups were on the receiving end of a funding frenzy in 2021 that birthed more than 100 “unicorns”, aka tech start-ups valued at more than $1bn.</p> <p>That number has since fallen to 31 so far this year, according to a report by London-based venture capital firm <strong>Atomico</strong>.</p> <p>There were a few reasons for this. Raising the kind of “super-companies”, as Ek once described it, with the power to attract top talent and venture capital dollars doesn't happen overnight.</p> <p>Europe lacks the local infrastructure of Big Tech companies to make “acquihires” — acquisitions targeted around sourcing talent rather than tech or profits — that are still commonplace in Silicon Valley, said <strong>Harry Nelis</strong>, a partner at<strong> Accel</strong>.</p> <p>“There is a bit more of a safety net in the US, where companies that are failing may be hoovered up by the big companies,” he added.</p> <p>Investors say that confidence, not capital, is the problem. There's still about $80bn worth of venture capital “dry powder” available in Europe, Atomico estimates, but investors remain skittish.</p> <p>Many bemoan a lack of support for tech companies from more traditional investors in Europe. “The panic is worse in Europe than the US among generalist fund managers,” said one VC, likely sending European founders back to the US when the IPO market does finally reopen. </p> <p>“I've been in this game for 20 years and it is exceptionally hard to read the tea leaves at the moment,” said <strong>Nic Brisbourne</strong>, managing partner at London-based <strong>Forward Partners</strong>.</p> <p>It turns out that some US firms including so-called crossover funds including<strong> Tiger Global </strong>and <strong>Insight Partners</strong> have begun pulling back from the continent out of fears that a recession could last longer in Europe than in the US.</p> <p>One of the highest-profile unicorns to feel the pain was Swedish “buy now, pay later” fintech <strong>Klarna,</strong> whose valuation <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/444e9971-16f0-48ba-b4b6-ad970cc116c1\">dropped from $46bn to $7bn</a> following a funding round in July.</p> <p>“Suddenly people don't want you to lean into the future but they want you to show profitability,” said Klarna's CEO <strong>Sebastian Siemiatkowski</strong> at a tech conference on Wednesday. “Unfortunately as a consequence of that we had to shift back.”</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Caio Mário Paes de Andrade</strong>, the fourth CEO of<strong> Petrobras </strong>in less than two years, <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/485793f2-19d7-49d8-a00d-24f18df157cc\">is to leave</a> the Brazilian state-controlled oil producer after accepting an invitation to join the incoming administration of the newly elected governor of São Paulo state. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Fiona Frick</strong> is stepping down as chief executive of Swiss asset manager <strong>Unigestion</strong>. She'll be replaced by head of private equity <strong>Christophe de Dardel</strong> in January.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>FTX </strong>founder <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried </strong><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftxs-bankman-fried-hires-white-collar-defense-attorney-mark-cohen-2022-12-06/\">has retained</a> defence attorney <a href=\"https://www.cohengresser.com/attorney/mark-s-cohen/\"><strong>Mark Cohen</strong></a> of <strong>Cohen &amp; Gresser</strong>, while<strong> Caroline Ellison</strong>, who ran SBF's trading firm <strong>Alameda Research</strong>, has hired Washington-based firm<strong> WilmerHale </strong>to represent her, according to Reuters. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>BNP Paribas </strong><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221207005243/en/BNP-Paribas-Appoints-Senior-Executives-to-Global-Markets-Americas-Platform\">has hired</a> seven senior executives for its global markets Americas platform from<strong> Morgan Stanley</strong>,<strong> Hayfin Capital Management</strong>,<strong> RBC</strong>,<strong> Stifel</strong>,<strong> Cantor Fitzgerald</strong>,<strong> Mizuho</strong> and <strong>CIBC Capital Markets</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Evonik </strong>chief financial officer <strong>Ute Wolf</strong> is stepping down. He'll be replaced by <strong>Maike Schuh</strong>, who leads the German chemicals group's performance materials division.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> alum <strong>Nishant Roy</strong> has been appointed chief communications and impact officer at yoghurt maker <strong>Chobani</strong>. He was most recently chief of strategic operations and chief of staff for Chobani's founder <strong>Hamdi Ulukaya</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Standard Chartered </strong><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-07/stanchart-hires-asia-investment-grade-credit-traders-in-rebuild\">has hired</a> Asia credit traders <strong>Chirag Srivastava</strong> and <strong>Wilfred Lee</strong> from <strong>Deutsche Bank </strong>and<strong> Mizuho</strong>, respectively, according to Bloomberg.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Big spender</strong> Asia's richest man Gautam Adani is embarking on a massive fundraising effort to fuel his rapid expansion, he told the FT in an interview.
