These deals enabled him to hide the size of his enormous positions in half a dozen US stocks from the broader market and the banks themselves before the scheme collapsed in March 2021.</p> <p>“The scale of the trading was stunning,” said Damian Williams, US attorney for the southern district of New York.</p> <p>Capital at Archegos, a relatively obscure family office, swelled from $1.5bn in March 2020 to $35bn a year later, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/four-charged-connection-multi-billion-dollar-collapse-archegos-capital-management\">according to the indictment</a>. At one point the group's positions totalled $160bn.</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Go deeper:</strong> Robert Armstrong looks more deeply at the alleged fraud and asks if the whole operation could have been a “pump and dump” scheme <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e2bc10d-6334-464c-8bd6-6fbf7661dc7b\">on a previously unimagined scale?</a></p></li> </ul> <p><em>What do you think?
