  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs warned on Monday that it would slow hiring and may cull underperforming staff even as the Wall Street giant's traders helped it overcome a slump in dealmaking and report better than expected profits in the second quarter.</p> <p>With fears of a recession mounting, Goldman chief executive<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/4006fa25-cd2f-409d-9683-296923b93b81\"> David Solomon</a> warned of increasing uncertainty owing to high inflation, monetary policy tightening in the US and the war in Ukraine. </p> <p>“In my dialogue with CEOs operating big global businesses, they tell me that they continue to see persistent inflation in their supply chain,” Solomon said in a call with analysts. </p> <p>Finance chief Denis Coleman said the bank was “closely re-examining all our forward spending and investment plans”. This includes slowing the pace of hiring and potentially reintroducing the year-end performance review of its employee base, which it had largely halted during the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5a39f59-615a-405e-8ddb-805b729953d4\">Financial Times reported last week</a> that Goldman had paused hiring some replacements for bankers who left this year. </p> <p>The downbeat outlook contrasted with the market's reaction to Goldman beating earnings, with the bank's share price up about 2.5 per cent on Monday.</p> <p>One analyst remarked to Solomon and Coleman that “your guys' tone sounds very, very cautious” despite “pretty strong results”. </p> <p>For the second quarter, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/980562d6-2db0-4b25-a349-b83d4b86bea7\">Goldman</a> reported net income fell 47 per cent to $2.9bn or $7.73 per share, from $5.5bn or $15.02 per share in the same period last year. This was ahead of analysts' estimates for $2.6bn or $6.65 per share, according to consensus data compiled by Bloomberg.</p> <p>Revenue from investment banking was down 41 per cent at $2.1bn, in line with analysts' estimates and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/363f5364-1848-4f93-a4f5-000891c5cbb0\">a smaller decline than</a> the 61 per cent reported last week by rival JPMorgan Chase and the 55 per cent fall at Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>Investment banks are suffering in particular from a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a560343-69eb-4e36-9833-cc579a7dc8ad\">dearth of equity underwriting activity</a>, following a slew of initial public offerings and listings by special purpose acquisition companies last year. </p> <p>Partially offsetting the investment banking declines were revenues in Goldman's trading division, which has benefited from heightened buying and selling during the recent market volatility. </p> <p>Revenues were up 32 per cent at $6.5bn, remaining above pre-pandemic levels and ahead of analysts' forecast for $5.8bn. Revenues from trading at JPMorgan were up 15 per cent and up 21 per cent at Morgan Stanley. </p> <p>Fixed-income trading revenues were up 55 per cent at $3.6bn, ahead of estimates for $3.1bn, while revenues from equities were 11 per cent higher at $2.9bn, also slightly ahead of analysts' expectations for $2.7bn.</p> <p>Goldman said its board of directors had approved a 25 per cent increase in its quarterly dividend to $2.50 per share. </p> <p>In the quarter, Goldman also provisioned $667mn for credit losses amid rising concerns that a potential recession in the US will affect credit quality. &#xa0;</p> <p>The bank's asset management division reported revenues of $1.1bn, down 79 per cent from the same period last year, when Goldman benefited from significant gains on its equity investments. Analysts had forecast revenues of $685mn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Revenue in the consumer and wealth management unit, which includes its online bank Marcus and its Apple credit card, was up 25 per cent at $2.2bn, just ahead of analysts' forecasts for $2.1bn.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2022 'Goldman Sachs warns of job cuts even as traders help beat profit forecasts' FT.com 18 July.
