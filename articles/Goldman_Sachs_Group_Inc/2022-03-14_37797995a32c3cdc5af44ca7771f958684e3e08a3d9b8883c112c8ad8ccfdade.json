Russia continued its offensive on Monday throughout Ukraine.</p><p>U.S. and Chinese security officials were meeting in Rome on Monday as the U.S. alleged that Russia was seeking military equipment from the world's number-two economy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the head of the International Monetary Fund said Sunday that she expects a “deep recession” in Russia due to “unprecedented” sanctions by the West after its invasion of Ukraine, and that a Russian sovereign default remains a possibility.</p><p>In an interview with CBS News' “Face the Nation,” IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said that she no longer saw a Russian debt default as an “improbable event.”</p><p>China, separately, locked down the key southeastern manufacturing hub of Shenzhen as it also combats a COVID outbreak in the northeast of the country.
