  "title": "Foreign Bribery Prosecutor Daniel Kahn Departs Justice Department; The Justice Department veteran, who helped enforce the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, is returning to law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell",
  "text": "<p>The FCPA, which bars companies from paying bribes to foreign public officials, has become one of the government's most potent tools for policing business overseas. The law applies to U.S. companies and to foreign companies listed on a U.S. stock exchange or with other U.S. ties.</p><p>Since the early 2000s, the Justice Department's enforcement of the law has led to a string of blockbuster settlements with some of the world's most well-known companies, including a $1.6 billion fine involving Siemens AG in 2008 and a $2.9 billion fine for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reached last year.</p><p>As enforcement of the law has expanded, law enforcement agencies and regulators in countries around the world have teamed up with the Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which also enforces the FCPA, to investigate and resolve cases of bribery by multinational corporations.</p><p>FCPA settlements increasingly involve a plethora of government agencies and fines split between two or more countries, as was the case with both the Siemens and Goldman Sachs settlements.</p><p>Mr. Kahn joined the Justice Department's fraud section, part of its criminal division, in 2010, and became chief of its FCPA unit in 2016. As he rose through the ranks of the unit, he worked on cases involving French transportation company Alstom SA and U.S. fashion company Ralph Lauren Corp.</p><p>In recent years, Mr. Kahn held a number of senior positions in the fraud section and criminal division. But he continued to be a key steward of the department's FCPA program, appearing on panels about the antibribery law at compliance conferences and at an appeals court hearing involving a former Alstom executive who was charged with violating the law.</p><p>He also oversaw teams of attorneys investigating healthcare and securities fraud and market manipulation cases. The fraud section, which consists of around 180 prosecutors, is one of the largest teams of white-collar prosecutors in the country.</p><p>Government priorities and the resources around white-collar crime frequently change, but the FCPA has remained the cornerstone of the fraud section's corporate enforcement program for nearly two decades.</p><p>That staying power derives from the fact that cases are worked by a dedicated unit that is staffed and overseen by career prosecutors, rather than by political appointees, Mr. Kahn said Wednesday.</p><p>\"I don't see a slowdown any time in the near future,\" Mr. Kahn said. \"They are continuing to look at new and innovative ways of identifying corruption.\"</p><p>Although investment of resources may vary slightly across administrations, Mr. Kahn said support for FCPA enforcement was consistent across the three administrations under which he served. That was also true under Donald Trump, who had called the FCPA a \"horrible law\" before becoming president, Mr. Kahn said.</p><p>The Biden administration, consistent with past administrations, has made anticorruption a pillar of the government's national security agenda, leading some lawyers to speculate that the Justice Department may commit additional resources to investigating FCPA cases.</p><p>Attorney General Merrick Garland in June launched a task force focused on enhancing the department's efforts to combat human trafficking and corruption in Mexico and the Central American countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, including through enforcement of the antibribery statute.</p><p>Mr. Kahn said he would miss his work at the Justice Department but looked forward to continuing to play a role as a partner in Davis Polk's white collar defense practice.</p><p>\"As much as I'm going to be sad to leave some of my closest friends at the department, I'm excited to join some of my old friends at the firm and the talented pool of attorneys there,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com</p><p>Foreign Bribery Prosecutor Daniel Kahn Departs Justice Department</p>",
