  "text": "<h2>Wall Street's Miami Vice&#xa0;</h2> <p>Dancers with flaming hula hoops performed for hundreds of revellers on the rooftop of <strong>MILA</strong>, the popular South Beach lounge. House music played and waiters traversing a Japanese-styled pond served smoking cocktails and meat cooked over molten volcanic rocks.</p> <p>This was the scene at just one of five investment industry events held in Miami and its surrounding towns in the final days of last month, with thousands of financiers in attendance as a winter storm pummeled Manhattan under a blanket of snow. </p> <p>Private equity bosses, hedge fund executives, venture capitalists and pension fund CIOs flocked to South Florida to defrost from a dreary first month of the year on Wall Street — all in search of a new investment opportunity, or simply a good time. </p> <p>“It felt like an old-school financial event,” one hedge fund industry veteran told DD's Antoine Gara during the MILA party, which was hosted by crypto trading group <strong>Anchorage Digital</strong> on the first night of the <strong>iConnections </strong>conference at the <strong>Fontainebleau Miami Beach </strong>hotel.</p> <p>Conferences played host to temporary visitors, but Miami's emergence as the fastest-growing financial centre in America looks permanent. </p> <p>This <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/77ee0d8d-bf74-4cc3-bde0-a064ce074726\">FT Weekend read</a> calls its balmy shores “the most important city in America” and details how it has been transformed from a haven of drugs, jai alai gambling and nightclubs into the world's fastest-growing billionaire enclave.</p> <p>The mayors of Miami-Dade and Miami Beach roamed the conference with elevator pitches at the ready as to why investment groups should consider relocating to the low-tax paradise.</p> <p>Firms from software buyout group <strong>Thoma Bravo</strong>, to <strong>SoftBank</strong>, and hedge funds <strong>Citadel</strong>, <strong>Icahn Associates</strong>, <strong>Elliott Management </strong>and <strong>Tiger Global Management </strong>have opened (or are about to open) Florida-based offices, with many planning to occupy the same office tower in the downtown neighbourhood of Brickell.*</p> <p>Consensus among the heads of companies who DD spoke to is that the migration from Manhattan to Miami is only accelerating. One called it the “greatest migration of wealth in human history”.</p> <p>The money was flowing at iConnections as hundreds of allocators and fundraising staff mingled at the glitzy Miami Beach hotel, speed-dating for new business in a football field-sized ballroom before attending private parties and dinners stretching late into the night.</p> <p>Among the festivities, sources told DD, was a bash of scotch and cigars hosted at the <strong>Empire Social Lounge</strong> by law firm <strong>Marcum</strong>, a <strong>UBS </strong>“Cap Intro” happy hour at the rooftop pool of the <strong>1 Hotel</strong>, and a private dinner at the <strong>La Côte</strong> restaurant hosted by <strong>Northern Trust</strong>. </p> <p>Events also included an invite-only round of golf at former president <strong>Donald Trump</strong>'s<strong> Doral Resort </strong>and a fundraiser for Republican Wyoming congressional contender<strong> Harriet Hageman</strong> hosted by billionaire<strong> Peter Thiel</strong> — the most prominent Silicon Valley executive <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/miami/2021/01/22/paypal-co-founder-peter-thiel-revealed-as-buyer-of-miami-beach-mansions/\">to decamp to</a> The Magic City.</p> <p>To close out the festivities at iConnections, rapper <strong>Nelly</strong> played a 30-minute set to about 1,000 attendees who crammed together in the “Liv” nightclub at the Fontainebleau, singing along to <em>Country Grammar</em>.</p> <p>But the party isn't over yet: this month, junk bond billionaire <strong>Michael Milken </strong>and his<strong> Milken Institute </strong>will host private meetings with financiers ranging from <strong>Blackstone</strong>'s<strong> Stephen Schwarzman</strong> to <strong>Vista Equity</strong>'s<strong> Robert Smith</strong> and <strong>Ken Griffin</strong> of Citadel.</p> <h2>No dice: a high-stakes gambling takeover runs out of chips</h2> <p>One offer, two rival expressions of interest, and a mysterious group of Asian shareholders later, one of the most bizarre UK takeover sagas of recent years has come to a close . . . for now.</p> <p><strong>Playtech</strong>, a company that provides technology to big betting groups such as <strong>Entain</strong>, failed to secure approval for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/409d624c-ef30-40dd-8ebc-24b41252a0bf\">£2.7bn takeover offer</a> from the Australian gambling company <strong>Aristocrat </strong>on Wednesday.</p> <p>Playtech has lingered at the edge of potential bidders' interest for years. Most have been put off by a series of corporate governance issues, sprawling operations and an unregulated Asian business that is so firmly integrated into the company it would be hard to divest.</p> <p>Then came Aristocrat.</p> <p>In October, the Australian company said that it planned to “review” Playtech's operations in markets where gambling isn't legal yet and tabled a £2.7bn bid.</p> <p>Playtech's share price shot up. It then continued to make gains far above the 680p per share offer price. Part of this was because Playtech's second-largest shareholder, Hong Kong investment group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9080198-13b3-4e77-9761-043c6f563580\"><strong>Gopher</strong></a>, and former <strong>Formula One</strong> boss <strong>Eddie Jordan</strong> both showed an interest in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85de888f-4f58-413c-a2c3-8342394da582\">buying the company</a>. </p> <p>Another reason for the share price jump was a set of Asian investors who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d475063-4ea7-4f02-9323-02b908e081bd\">started to buy shares</a> in the company at about 720p per share. Playtech said it tried to contact the investors, bankers and advisers but received no response.</p> <p>Members of the group aren't entirely unknown. One is the renowned Chinese businessman and poker player <strong>Paul Suen</strong>, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f48a646-9468-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582\">floated</a> <strong>Birmingham City Football Club</strong> on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Another is <strong>Stanley Choi</strong>, whose <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c43981e-d36c-4d9d-921f-ea376387869b\">acquisition</a> of <strong>Wigan Athletic </strong>ultimately resulted in it falling into administration.</p> <p>Last month, Jordan followed Gopher's lead in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/279768f5-5381-4174-a92e-bcd6e1216a23\">pulling out</a> of the race to buy Playtech, citing uncertainty over whether the Asian investors, who now own 27 per cent of Playtech's shares, would support the deal.</p> <p>Aristocrat ploughed ahead, only to find out to its detriment that the Asian group wasn't going to play ball. Playtech has said it would now try to create value by breaking up the business. The <strong>UK Takeover Panel </strong>has investigated whether the investors were acting as a concert party, but hasn't announced any findings.</p> <p>As one M&amp;A adviser put it to the FT's Alice Hancock: “I have never seen anything that is such a farce as this.”</p> <h2>Is this the end of a buttoned-up era?</h2> <p>Glimpsing down Wall Street or the runway, it's clear that the suit and tie combo is becoming an endangered species.</p> <p>Traditional business attire has been hanging by a thread for some time. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5e28c60-06af-45d0-9d74-f88862dce77e\">fall of <strong>Brooks Brothers</strong></a>, the brand once sported by everyone from <strong>Abraham Lincoln</strong> to <strong>John F Kennedy</strong> to the bigwigs at<strong> Lehman Brothers </strong>and <strong>Bear Stearns</strong>, ushered in the beginning of the end in 2020.</p> <p>Then came Delta and Omicron and the repeatedly prolonged shift to working from home where even the best-dressed bankers found difficulty resisting the allure of an elastic waistband.</p> <p>Next to go, the FT's menswear critic Alexander Fury <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5439be68-3177-4a6c-ba35-7775843f2cfd\">predicts</a>, could be the classic button-down shirt. Newly unveiled collections at <strong>Prada</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7f2299f-3bf9-44ce-8ceb-5ca04a196638\">Spac-listed <strong>Zegna</strong></a>, <strong>Hermès</strong> and others were conspicuously lacking in plackets, buttons and collars, instead opting for an air of relaxed luxury.</p> <p>As the fashion world transitions from business casual to, well, just casual, DD wonders if the finance world will follow suit.</p> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b761588-417a-11e9-b896-fe36ec32aece\">eliminated formal business wear</a> years ago, but cautioned that its bankers must still dress “in a manner consistent with your clients' expectations”.&#xa0;</p> <p>In an industry where going sans-tie is a statement of boldness, we imagine it'll be a while before more flowing silhouettes are embraced.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Jeff Zucker</strong>, the longtime head of cable news network <strong>CNN</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c7d48b0-eaac-421e-a38e-c54f354becdc\">has resigned</a> after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with a colleague.</p></li>  <li><p>Renewable energy group <strong>Siemens Gamesa </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa462efc-0f41-4bcb-8e3b-9e3e58b505ff\">has replaced</a> its chief executive <strong>Andreas Nauen</strong>, the second CEO to be ousted in less than two years by the company amid underperformance.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Exor</strong>, the holding company that manages the interests of Italy's billionaire <strong>Agnelli</strong> family, has named <strong>Benoît Ribadeau-Dumas</strong> as a partner. Ribadeau-Dumas, a former chief of staff to France's prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6879271-f5f2-49f7-bdb7-d6edb06de7f5\">most recently served</a> as deputy chief of French reinsurer <strong>Scor</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Harbour Energy</strong> executive director <strong>Phil Kirk</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42f8ca22-b373-439d-86ca-15cc562f4848\">is to step down</a> from the business he helped turn into the largest UK-listed independent oil and gas group.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Centerview Partners</strong> has appointed <strong>Mark Tercek</strong> as a senior adviser based in Washington. He previously served as CEO of <strong>The Nature Conservancy</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Poppin' bottles </strong>Swelling salaries and bonuses on Wall Street have resurrected a bygone era of frivolous spending as bankers shell out on $2,000 bottles of wine, luxury yachts and more.
