  "title": "Chinese-Backed Lanvin Group Makes New York Trading Debut After SPAC Merger; Luxury fashion company has raised over $150 million at a valuation of $1 billion",
  "text": "<p>The company's shares traded at above $14 in the midmorning, before ending the day at $7.63.</p><p>Primavera's SPAC, called Primavera Capital Acquisition Corp., raised $414 million in January 2021, at the height of the blank-check company boom. It said at the time that it wanted to merge with a global consumer company that had \"a significant China presence or a compelling China potential.\"</p><p>SPACs are publicly listed shell companies with ready pools of cash to invest in—and merge with—private businesses. If a SPAC fails to find a merger target by a deadline, typically two years, investors can take their money back. SPAC shareholders can also choose to redeem their shares upon a merger.</p><p>Lanvin Group and Primavera, founded by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Greater China chairman Fred Hu, announced the merger in March. The deal has faced multiple hurdles including a stock market rout, currency market volatility and investors' waning interest in de-SPACs, a term used to describe SPACs' eventual acquisitions of operating businesses.</p><p>In October, Lanvin lowered its valuation from $1.25 billion to $1 billion, the same amount at which it was valued after a private fundraising round last year. The company blamed the reduced valuation on foreign-exchange fluctuations and the declining valuations of its bigger rivals such as LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE and Kering.</p><p>Lanvin owns five brands that were acquired by Fosun, a Shanghai-based conglomerate co-founded by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang. Fosun was once known as one of the most deal-hungry Chinese companies, making a spate of acquisitions before Beijing cracked down on outbound investments a few years ago.</p><p>The flagship in the portfolio is fashion house Lanvin, which was founded in 1889. Others under the group include Wolford, a high-end Austrian women's hosiery brand, Italian shoemaker Sergio Rossi, American luxury house St. John and tailoring label Caruso.</p><p>Most fresh capital raised by the group was from outside institutional investors, including Japanese conglomerate Itochu Corp. Around 97% of the original SPAC shareholders redeemed their shares upon the merger, meaning they took back the cash invested in the shell company.</p><p>The average redemption rate for de-SPAC transactions has shot up to 84% this year from 45% last year, according to data from SPAC Research. A rate of 84% means that investors have redeemed $84 of every $100 they put in.</p><p>\"The biggest challenge has been getting investors to focus on a company's fundamentals in a market where SPACs have been labeled as something equal to failure,\" said Max Chen, a Primavera partner and a director of Lanvin Group.</p><p>The change in the market environment has made investors less willing to invest in SPACs, said Benjamin Kwasnick, founder of SPAC Research. \"SPACs have always been easier in a bull market and it's not surprising that investors are staying focused on yield rather than fundamental investment in new companies right now,\" he said.</p><p>Lanvin Group plans to use the money it raised to expand in Asia and North America, where consumer recognition of its brands is still low. In China, the company has been using live-stream commerce to boost sales. It has formed a partnership with Shopify for online retailing in the U.S. The group wants to increase the share of sales through e-commerce platforms to 20% by 2025 from around 10% at the moment, according to Chief Executive Joann Cheng.</p><p>Fosun bought Lanvin in 2018 for an undisclosed price, stepping in when the French brand was teetering on the edge of collapse following several years of creative-personnel turnover and sagging sales. The company has been trying to turn around the label founded by Jeanne Lanvin, opening new stores across major Chinese cities. Luxury brands have held up well this year despite a sluggish economic environment.</p><p>In the first half of this year, Lanvin Group's sales grew 73% to 202 million euros, equivalent to around $216 million at current exchange rates. The company projects that it can break even in 2024 and turn a profit in 2025.</p><p>\"We see ourselves as a startup,\" said Ms. Cheng, who is also a vice president of Fosun. \"We account for a very small share in the vast, growing luxury market. There's a lot of potential for us in the biggest cities in both the U.S. and China.\"</p><p>Write to Jing Yang at jing.yang@wsj.com</p><p>Chinese-Backed Lanvin Group Makes New York Trading Debut After SPAC Merger</p>",
