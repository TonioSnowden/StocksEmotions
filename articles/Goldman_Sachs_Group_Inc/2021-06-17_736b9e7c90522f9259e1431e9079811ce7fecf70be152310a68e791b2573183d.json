  "text": "<p>   BEIJING -- China's economic growth moderated in May as flattering comparisons to the pandemic-hit economic figures early last year tapered off and Chinese consumers continued to keep a close eye on their pocketbooks. </p><p>   Factory output, a key growth pillar in China's pandemic recovery for more than a year, remained resilient, but investment and domestic consumption fell short of expectations despite a boost from a long holiday, weighed down by a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections. </p><p>   China's industrial production rose 8.8% from a year earlier in May, slowing from April's 9.8% pace, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Wednesday. The reading of factory output, which was buoyed by strong overseas demand for Chinese-made goods, matched the median forecast made by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   The key gauge of factory activity was 13.6% higher than the level recorded in May 2019, long before the economy was hit by the coronavirus, the statistics bureau said. Officials have been comparing monthly economic data with the same period two years earlier to filter out distortions from last year's pandemic shock. </p><p>   The double-digit percentage growth compared with pre-virus levels is much higher than the roughly 6% year-over-year expansion that China's industrial sector was logging each month before the pandemic, underscoring the strength of the current rebound in China's industrial sector. </p><p>   But if China's factories have continued to top expectations, its consumers have been consistent in disappointing policy makers, who have been hoping for a pivot toward domestic spending as the main driver of the economy. Retail sales rose 12.4% in May compared with a year earlier, slowing from the 17.7% year-over-year growth rate in April and falling short of the 13.6% gain anticipated by economists. </p><p>   Unlike the U.S.'s stimulus program, which put money directly into households' bank accounts, Beijing's response boosted investment and helped businesses hit by Covid-19. </p><p>   \"The direction of China consumption is to further improve, but the pace of its recovery will be slow,\" said Hui Shan, chief China economist at Goldman Sachs. Ms. Shan said that even more than a year after the initial outbreak, Chinese consumers' propensity to save rather than spend remained high. </p><p>   That tendency toward caution has made domestic spending a laggard in China's recovery, which has instead been powered primarily by industrial production, exports and government-backed investment. </p><p>   The hoped-for pickup in consumer spending didn't materialize despite further signs of improvement in China's labor market. The headline measure of joblessness, the urban surveyed unemployment rate, fell for a third consecutive month, to 5.0% in May -- its lowest level in two years. </p><p>   Bo Zhuang, a China economist for London-based economic-research firm TS Lombard, blamed the lackluster spending figures on sluggish wage growth, a relatively slow vaccination campaign and longer-term behavioral changes induced by the pandemic. </p><p>   Fu Linghui, a spokesman for China's statistics bureau, acknowledged the unbalanced nature of the recovery, pointing on Wednesday to a global economic rebound that was itself lopsided and facing rising global commodity prices. </p><p>   Recent data suggest that, with new infections flaring up around the country, prompting localized lockdowns by officials, consumer spending may remain subdued for some time. </p><p>   Economists blamed a tightening of social-distancing rules for dissuading long-distance travel and spending. Others said reduced volumes in the large shipping ports of Guangdong province, which accounts for roughly one-quarter of China's exports and one-tenth of economic output, could blunt a crucial driver of China's economy while pushing up the prices of industrial goods. </p><p></p>",
