  "text": "<p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX ended with a gain of 53.64 points, or 1.4%, at 4,003.58.</p><p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 397.82 points, or 1.2%, finishing at 34,098.10.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite advanced 149.89 points, or 1.4%, to close at 11,174.40.</p><p>What drove markets</p><p>Stocks rallied in thin trade as Wall Street continued to expect the Fed to downshift their tightening pace next month, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, in a note.</p><p>Concerns about renewed COVID restrictions in China were blamed for market weakness on Monday and may continue to weigh on equities after investors had previously raised hopes for a loosening of curbs.</p><p>\"The irony is that the China reopening story has been a big positive driver of China-related risk and overall markets over the last couple of weeks, so we are trading between feast and famine on this story,\" wrote Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, in a morning note.</p><p>\"Both could of course be ultimately right. There might be many more restrictions in the near term but stronger more durable re-openings by the spring. Markets are struggling to price this at the moment though,\" Reid added.</p><p>It's a holiday-shortened week for Wall Street, where volumes traditionally tend to thin notably in the run-up to Thanksgiving on Thursday and Black Friday.</p><p>Read also: Is the stock market open on Black Friday? Thanksgiving week trading hours for major assets.</p><p>The implications of thin trading are important to remember from here out this week, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. It's been a \"predominantly constructive market\" so far, he said. But it's \"a week that will have ultra light volume.\" Those conditions \"tend to accentuate the moves in either direction,\" he said.</p><p>The good news is that might be accentuating the positive, at least in early session trading. \"On balance, what we are looking at is a lot of things stabilizing today,\" Hogan said. That includes oil prices and late third-quarter earnings that were coming in \"more good news than bad news,\" Hogan noted.</p><p>MarketWatch Live: Here's the stock market's Thanksgiving week track record — stretching back to 1950</p><p>Best Buy Co. Inc. BBY and Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. DKS gained ground Tuesday after beating analyst expectations. Oil prices increased after Saudi Arabia denied a report they were weighing a potential production increase.</p><p>In a note published late on Monday, the Goldman strategy research team led by David Kostin, said that assuming the U.S. economy manages a soft landing then the stock market will experience \"less pain but also no gain\" in 2023.</p><p>\"The performance of U.S. stocks in 2022 was all about a painful valuation derating but the equity story for 2023 will be about the lack of EPS growth. Zero earnings growth will match zero appreciation in the S&amp;P 500. Our valuation model implies an unchanged P/E multiple of 17x and a year-end index level of 4000,\" said Kostin.</p><p>There were no U.S. economic updates of note set for release on Tuesday, while a raft of data is due Wednesday, including minutes of the Fed's November policy meeting.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. shares initially dipped but rebounded Tuesday after releasing itsthird-quarter earnings. Shares of the retailer rose 10.1%, after the company beat estimates with positive same-store sales and offered a rosy outlook.</p><p>* Best Buy Co. Inc. shares advanced 12.8% after third-quarter profit, revenue and same-stores sales all exceeded estimates.</p><p>* Dell Technologies Inc. DELL shares advanced 6.8%, following quarterly earnings released after Monday's trading session. While earnings beat estimates, the company's fourth-quarter revenue expectationswere lower than analyst expectations.</p><p>—Jamie Chisholm contributed to this article.</p><p>Dow ends nearly 400 points higher as investors await Fed minutes</p>",
