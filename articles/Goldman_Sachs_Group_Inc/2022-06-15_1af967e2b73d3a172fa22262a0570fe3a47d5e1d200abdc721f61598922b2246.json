  "text": "<p>Cliff Asness, the co-founder and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, had been championing value ahead of its recent outperformance. In an interview with Goldman Sachs that was published by the investment bank, Asness said the outperformance will continue. \"I've never been a strong believer that the sharp drop in interest rates fully justified the high market valuations and divergence between growth and value in recent years. But the rates reversal has clearly played an important part in the recent value rally because as long as the world believes that value is an interest-rate trade, investors are going to be somewhat hostage to that view, at least over the near term,\" he said. He said value can outperform over a horizon of roughly three years because the valuation spread remains stretched.</p><p>Asness rejected the idea that value stocks could lose their outperformance if rates head in the other direction. \"Our research finds no evidence that higher interest rates are necessary for value to outperform. Of course, I recognize the logic that lower rates benefit companies with cash flows further out into the future. But it's also the case that one of the reasons value strategies tend to outperform in the long run is because investors overestimate how long growth companies will grow,\" he said.</p><p>The issue isn't that the world can't identify good companies, but pays too much for them. He said he pushed back in 2017 that it was time to pour into value. \"I wasn't smart enough to short value heading into 2018, but I hope my pushback against value strategies back then gives me some credibility now when I say that current prices are crazy and value should continue to outperform.\"</p><p>More broadly, he said the firm was underweight equities and bonds relative to normal levels, and less underweight bonds and more underweight equities than six months ago. \"A big part of that is the recent strong rise in bond yields, which has left bonds looking somewhat less expensive today than six months ago, unless you expect inflation to remain in the high single-digits, in which case everything looks expensive. And, relatedly, while equities are down quite a bit, the decline hasn't been sharp enough to increase their relative attractiveness to bonds,\" he said.</p><p>The buzz</p><p>The Federal Open Market Committee decision is due at 2 p.m. Eastern. Markets will focus on not just the size of the rate increase — 75 basis points, if markets are correct — but the projections on how far rates will subsequently rise, as well as the inflation and unemployment forecasts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30 p.m.</p><p>Ackman said the Fed should hike by 75 basis points at each of the next two meetings, though he said it would be even better if the Fed moved with 100 basis point rises. Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital advocates for a one-time 200 basis point jump.</p><p>The European Central Bank said it would use authority under an existing program to curb widening bond spreads.</p><p>Retail sales surprisingly fell in May, as a New York-area manufacturing gauge remained in negative territory.</p><p>Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates says crypto is 100% based on the greater fool theory. He did say he isn't long or short \"any of those things.\"</p><p>President Joe Biden wrote to oil companies, including Exxon Mobil XOM, asking for refiners to produce more gasoline.</p><p>The markets</p><p>Ahead of the Fed decision and a 10.2% drop for the S&amp;P 500 SPX over the last five days, U.S. stock futures ES00 NQ00 were higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y slipped to 3.36%.</p><p>Top tickers</p><p>These were the most active stock-market tickers as of 6 a.m. Eastern. </p><p> Ticker   Security name  TSLA     Tesla  GME      GameStop  AMC      AMC Entertainment  NIO      NIO  AAPL     Apple  RDBX     Redbox Entertainment  AMZN     Amazon.com  BABA     Alibaba  TWTR     Twitter  NVDA     Nvidia</p><p>Random reads</p><p>A 78-year-old finally got his high school diploma, denied for decades over a library book fine.</p><p>A few fans are mourning the demise of Microsoft's Internet Explorer.</p><p>California food is all the rage in Europe's trendy restaurants.</p><p>Need to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.
