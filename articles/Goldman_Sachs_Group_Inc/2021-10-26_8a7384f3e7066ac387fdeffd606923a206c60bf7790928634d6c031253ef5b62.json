  "text": "<p>While the typical check size written by LPs was steady for several years, it rose last year and has remained elevated in 2021.</p><p>\"VCs are taking bigger checks than ever from more LPs than ever,\" the Different Funds report concluded. That helps explain how the venture-fund market has been growing.</p><p>Venture funds in the U.S. raised $96 billion through the third quarter of this year, up from $85.8 billion in all of 2020, according to the latest PitchBook-NVCA Venture Monitor report. The total is likely to increase by year-end, as more funds are in the market.</p><p>New entrants introduce some risk to the market, the Different Funds report said, such as that they may be more fickle should return expectations not be met. When funds are raised quickly one after another, LPs face the additional risk of a lack of time diversification, said Aakar Vachhani, a partner at Fairview Capital.</p><p>For now, though, interest in the venture asset class is at a high and venture firms are quick to capitalize on it.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>SPAC deal. Youth-focused online platform FaZe Clan Inc. is combining with a special-purpose acquisition company to go public with a roughly $1 billion valuation, the companies said, WSJ reports.</p><p>Based in Los Angeles, FaZe Clan markets itself as a leading online-gaming company and a brand created by young people that targets millennials and Gen Z consumers. Its business includes esports, merchandise and digital content.

The firm has opened a virtual data room for its next flagship fund, according to several people familiar with the matter. Private-equity firms often use virtual data rooms to allow investors to access documents they may need to conduct due diligence on new fundraising efforts. The firm has yet to communicate to investors a formal target specifying how much it plans to raise for the fund, the people said, but they added that they expect it to match, if not exceed, the size of the firm's previous main fund.</p><p>Francisco Partners Targets $2 Billion for New Fund Focused on Smaller Tech Deals</p><p>Private-equity firm Francisco Partners is targeting $2 billion for its third Agility fund, which will focus on smaller deals than the technology-focused firm's main vehicles, according to people familiar with the matter, WSJ Pro reports. If Francisco Partners reaches its goal for the new fund it would be over 33% larger than its predecessor Agility fund, which closed with $1.5 billion last year. The San Francisco-based firm's maiden Agility fund collected $600 million in 2016. Francisco Partners earmarked its first Agility fund for investments of less than $50 million, according to a press release issued when it closed, and last year the firm said its second Agility fund would target investments of less than $125 million in 13 to 15 companies.</p><p>Experience Management Forum</p><p>If you're interested in fintech and customer experience, come along to the WSJ Experience Management Forum on Nov. 1.
