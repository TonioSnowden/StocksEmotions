  "text": "<p>The UK Treasury has taken taxpayer stakes in more than 150 British companies, including a vegan foodmaker, a trendy cinema chain and a kombucha-based drinks brewer in an unprecedented shift into state-backed capital.</p> <p>Chancellor Rishi Sunak, a former hedge fund executive and Goldman Sachs analyst, approved the novel expansion of the state as part of a Covid-19 support scheme launched last year.</p> <p>The Treasury has published the names of the 158 companies that have converted loans under the £1.1bn state-backed Future Fund scheme into equity for the first time, revealing the scores of largely lossmaking companies that now count the UK taxpayer as a shareholder.</p> <p>These include shopping app Cherryz, mobile beauty service Secret Spa, ticketing platform Dice FM, car-selling site Motorway.co.uk and Snoop, the banking app founded by former Virgin Money boss Jayne-Anne Gadhia.</p> <p>The Secret Cinema chain, a group partly backed by private equity and family office money that recently recruited former Sony Entertainment boss Michael Lynton as a director, also used the Future Fund to raise cash during the pandemic. </p> <p>The investment fund now includes vegan food maker Pollen + Grace, craft suppliers LoveCrafts, football team app Footballnet Digital, luxury handbag rental service Cocoon Club, and a maker of low-cost inflatable infant incubators. </p> <p>Other companies make parka coats and snow suits, ships, protein bars and soft drinks, including Better Tasting Drinks, which makes kombucha-infused products, and Raffolux, a gambling site that offers “luxury raffles”. </p> <p>“We have done something that nobody has done before,” said one ally of the chancellor. “Some of these companies are doing extremely well and we have a lot to learn from them.”</p> <p>Other companies with taxpayer investors include those in medical and education technology, software, AI and data analytics. Among these are London-based Kano, which makes educational computing kits for children and recently collaborated with rapper Kanye West on a digital music player; Perceptual Robotics, which uses drones to inspect wind turbines; and Airfinity, which offers insights on Covid-19 trends to subscribers that its website suggests include the UK and Australian governments. </p> <p>The Future Fund was launched in May last year to offer loans to help lossmaking start-ups that could not access other support schemes — however, these loans would convert into equity stakes at the next funding round if not repaid. External investors were required to at least match the Future Fund.</p> <p>Almost 1,200 businesses have taken loans worth £1.1bn, which is likely to leave the chancellor with stakes in hundreds more companies. </p> <p>The government has only revealed companies where the stakes have converted, and has resisted attempts using transparency law to divulge companies that have taken convertible loans.</p> <p>Ken Cooper, managing director, venture solutions at the British Business Bank, the state-owned institution that has overseen the fund, said: “As a shareholder in so many promising businesses, the Future Fund is well positioned to support, and benefit from their continued growth.”</p> <p>Companies backed by the fund also include Vaccitech, which helped create the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine that listed this year in New York, and Ripple Energy, which allows customers to own shares of a wind farm.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the chancellor will invite tech bosses and investors to a conference in east London, including from Funding Circle and Monzo.</p> <p>Sunak said ahead of the event that the Future Fund “was set up to ensure that investment keeps flowing to our most innovative businesses, and it's fantastic that taxpayers now have equity in these top-performing start-ups”.</p> <p>The BBB said it “will manage the Future Fund shareholdings in these companies in a commercial, responsible manner on behalf of the government and taxpayer”.</p> <p>Many smaller companies are lossmaking as they seek to invest in their growth, instead relying on equity investment, which means that they could not use the other Covid bank loan schemes last year. </p><p>Source: Daniel Thomas, George Parker and Tim Bradshaw 2021 'UK chancellor takes taxpayer stakes in more than 150 start-ups' FT.com 13 September.
