  "text": "<p>Such reticence would give officials more flexibility in planning their next few moves. They have increased rates at a historically rapid pace this year, and the outlook for inflation and growth is highly uncertain. They will have several more reports on hiring and inflation before their Sept. 20-21 meeting.</p><p>\"We expect that Fed officials will want to keep their options open and will avoid any strong guidance,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report last week.</p><p>Mr. Powell has publicly signaled the central bank's moves ahead of each policy meeting this year, as it accelerated the pace of removing stimulus to combat soaring inflation.</p><p>Immediately after the past two Fed meetings, Mr. Powell specified the expected rate move at the subsequent meeting. In May, he and his colleagues had indicated they would likely raise rates by a half percentage point, or 50 basis points, at their meeting in mid-June. But inflation data released days before the June gathering pointed to a worsening outlook and prompted them to approve a larger 0.75-point rate increase.</p><p>After the June meeting, Mr. Powell said officials were most likely to consider rate increases of a half point or 0.75 point at this week's meeting. He also said the 0.75-point rate rise was \"an unusually large one, and I do not expect moves of this size to be common.\"</p><p>Then, another report two weeks ago showing stronger and more broadly based inflation pressures led investors to bet that the Fed might raise rates by a full percentage point this week. Markets later dialed back those expectations after some officials poured cold water on them.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>How would you rate the Fed's communication regarding expected rate increases? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Several analysts question whether the costs of the Fed's so-called forward guidance, which risks locking policy makers into a course of action they may later find unappealing, outweigh any benefits now because of high uncertainty over the outlook for inflation and interest rates.</p><p>\"If I had my druthers, I'd try to back away from giving basis-point guidance for the next meeting or two. The argument is that they don't really know\" how inflation and the economy will evolve, said William English, a former senior Fed economist who is now a professor at the Yale School of Management. \"I just don't think it's all that helpful.\"</p><p>Other central bankers have also recently raised rates more aggressively than they had led markets to expect, in response to surging inflation. The European Central Bank last week raised rates by a half point after saying a quarter-point rate increase was likely. \"We are not offering forward guidance of any kind,\" ECB President Christine Lagarde said after the meeting.</p><p>The Bank of Canada raised rates by a full percentage point earlier this month, more than the 0.75-point increase anticipated by market participants and economists.</p><p>On a panel discussion with Ms. Lagarde and other central banks last month, Mr. Powell defended the Fed's use of guidance this year. Many interest rates set in the markets, such as mortgage rates and bond yields, have risen more than the Fed has raised its benchmark rate this year because investors correctly understood the Fed's intentions.</p><p>Mr. Powell said this enabled the Fed to raise borrowing costs across the economy and slow down economic growth more quickly than would have been possible with just a handful of fed-funds rate increases. \"People will look back on this period and say that we were able to have financial conditions tighten quite substantially, and we've only had three meetings at which we raised rates,\" he said.</p><p>Some analysts say the Fed's forward guidance has still been a useful tool because it can damp large bond-market swings caused partly by uncertainty over its intentions. \"It would be beneficial to reduce that volatility to the extent that the Fed is able,\" said Mark Cabana, head of interest-rate strategy at Bank of America.</p><p>Providing further guidance could be difficult if officials aren't able to agree on how high they should raise rates in the coming months. Officials last month broadly agreed the fed-funds rate would need to rise at least above 3% this year, but some officials have recently indicated it should rise closer to 4% by December.</p><p>The Fed began announcing its rate moves in 1994 after they were approved, but didn't provide guidance about their likely size or pace ahead of time. After a prolonged period of low rates, it raised rates 3 percentage points in a one-year span beginning in February 1994. The unexpectedly rapid tightening hammered bond prices more than almost any time in the postwar era. Orange County, Calif., went bankrupt and Mexico devalued its peso, ravaging its economy. The Fed lowered rates modestly in 1995 amid fears the economy might slide into recession.</p><p>When then-Chairman Alan Greenspan again prepared to raise rates in 2004, he incorporated the advice of Ben Bernanke—an accomplished academic who at the time was a Fed governor, and later became chairman—who said that clearer guidance about the Fed's goals and intentions would make their policy more effective.</p><p>\"Ambiguity has its uses, but mostly in noncooperative games like poker,\" Mr. Bernanke told colleagues in 2003, according to transcripts of a Fed policy meeting that year. \"Monetary policy is a cooperative game. The whole point is to get financial markets on our side and for them to do some of our work for us.\"</p><p>Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com</p><p>After Fed Raises Interest Rates Wednesday, Investors to Look for Clues About What's Next</p>",
