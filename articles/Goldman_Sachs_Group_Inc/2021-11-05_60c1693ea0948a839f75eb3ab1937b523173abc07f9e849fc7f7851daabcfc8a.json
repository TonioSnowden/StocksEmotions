  "title": "Goldman says the bullish case remains intact for oil, as commodity bounces off worst session since October",
  "text": "<p>That was the message from Goldman Sachs analysts, who said the oil market is undersupplied and facing more volatility, at the end of a week that's set to deliver the commodity's worst losses since August.</p><p>“Net,&#xa0;our bullish view remains unchanged: the oil deficit remains unresolved, the current strength in&#xa0;oil demand remains a near-term tailwind&#xa0;and the&#xa0;increasingly structural nature of the deficits will require much higher long-dated oil prices,” said a Goldman team led by Damien Courvalin, in a note dated Nov. 4.</p><p>Oil contracts tumbled Thursday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, kept crude production increases in place, defying pressure from the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden to get more supply flowing.</p><p>“The now open disagreement between OPEC and the U.S. administration, the threat of an SPR [Strategic Petroleum Reserve] release and the potential resumption in negotiations with Iran will nonetheless increase the volatility in oil prices in coming weeks, especially as trading liquidity falls into year-end,” said Couravlin and his colleagues.</p><p>But they said even if the U.S. tapped its emergency oil supplies, such a move would be of “modest and temporary help and could in fact backfire given the structural nature of the oil market deficits starting in 2023.”</p><p>Read:U.S. oil producers pose 'emerging threat' after OPEC+ defies calls to speed production increases</p><p>Couravlin said the analysts' favored bullish oil trade now is a long Dec-22 contract, which offers “the best return vs. volatility trade off as perceived near-term bearish risks (COVID, OPEC, Iran, U.S. SPR) would only further delay the required ramp-up in investment and exacerbate the structural deficits that we forecast starting in 2023.” The bank has a $90-a-barrel end-2021 forecast for Brent crude.</p><p>On Friday, West Texas Intermediate crude for December delivery&#xa0;CLZ21CL00&#xa0;climbed $1.32, or 1%, to $79.86 a barrel. Thursday's action saw crude tumble 2.5% to settle at $78.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Front-month contract prices saw the lowest finish since Oct. 7, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>For the week so far, WTI is down 5.6%, which already marks the worst return since a 6.7% drop in the week ending Aug. 6, according to FactSet.</p><p>January Brent crude&#xa0;BRN00BRNF22,&#xa0;the global benchmark, was up 17 cents to $80.70 a barrel. Brent tumbled 1.8% to $80.55 a barrel on Thursday, its lowest level since Oct. 1. Down 3.8% so far this week, the contract is also looking at its worst weekly performance since the week ending Aug. 6, when it fell 7.8%.</p><p>At its Thursday meeting, OPEC said it would raise the monthly overall production by 400,000 barrels a day in December, a decision that analysts said wasn't a big surprise. Its next meeting will be Dec. 2.</p><p>Biden has blamed&#xa0;Russia and OPEC for surging U.S. gasoline prices, calling on the cartel and its allies to pump more oil.</p><p>Prices for several petroleum products were on the rise, with December gasoline&#xa0;RBZ21up 0.8% to $2.312 a gallon and December heating oil&#xa0;HHOZ21up 0.8% to $2.427 a gallon.</p><p>The December natural-gas futures NGZ21 contract fell nearly 2% to $5.715 per million British thermal units.</p>",
