Some sense of normality — or as the prime minister prefers it, a “major step forward in our road map to freedom”, was restored to British life today as the next phase in the great unlocking got under way across much of the country.</p> <p>All shops in England are now allowed to open, as are local amenities such as libraries, while pubs and restaurants can serve customers outdoors and wider social contact is permitted. The next stage of reopening, set for May 17, will see restrictions further relaxed before the final phase on June 21 — coronavirus data permitting — when all restrictions on business and social life will be removed. </p> <p>Struggling high street retailers will take heart from new data showing Britons have saved an additional <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e7b5c88-937c-445f-859c-2f9653332afe\">£180bn</a> during the pandemic — almost 10 per cent of the UK's annual gross domestic product — and pray that pent-up demand will encourage consumers to splash the cash. </p> <p>The Office for Budget Responsibility, the UK fiscal watchdog, said spending these savings could add about 6 per cent to consumption in 2021 and 2022. Economists are divided, however, over whether the urge to splurge will take priority over newly acquired habits of thrift. And poorer households, which are more likely to respond to changes in their financial conditions, will not have enjoyed the same accumulation of savings. </p> <p>For many bricks-and-mortar outlets, the grand reopening after three months of forced closure has come too late. Others are clinging on in the hope that the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd653e6a-dbd1-46a6-b44b-4d819a552e9f\">boom in ecommerce</a> that has been turbocharged by the pandemic — as evidenced in research showing that online <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00559d14-84da-4184-bc8f-1d6ec090b106\">grocery shopping</a> has become profitable for the big UK supermarkets for the first time — does not herald permanent closing time for the high street.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/2c970196-2db6-4c1d-ac7b-cea05aa8feb9.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p>Our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c06f107-d026-425f-92ff-4c9a89249662\">Economists Exchange</a> series features former US Treasury secretary <strong>Larry Summers</strong> on the “substantially excessive” recovery plans of President Joe Biden. “I look at the response and I look at the scale of the problem and I can't see how it adds up,” he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/380ea811-e927-4fe1-aa5b-d213816e9073\">tells the FT's Martin Wolf</a>. Federal Reserve chair <strong>Jay Powell</strong> warned that the pandemic still had the capacity to derail the country's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9b927a7c-b459-46df-ab49-54daca7e58c6\">economic comeback</a>. </p> <p>As in much of Latin America, inflation in <strong>Brazil</strong> is surging and having a serious impact on affordability of food for the country's poorest, already suffering from&#xa0;rising joblessness and the withdrawal of social programmes. Critics have given President <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5dbcc5b2-2d9e-46b7-b9d5-1b612aa20cf3\">Jair Bolsonaro</a>, also under fire for his handling of the pandemic, the nickname of “Bolsocaro” — a combination of his name and the Portuguese word for expensive.</p> <p><strong>India</strong> is at present recording more <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eaec6871-8306-4c9b-b1c7-dcf9326f8164#post-1de75950-4218-4354-80f8-aa0cb364d282\">new coronavirus infections</a> than anywhere in the world with 170,000 registered on Sunday and 900 deaths. This second wave could damage <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/746ea3f9-5b5a-4c02-a0e4-6d7c5491fe0f\">IMF forecasts</a> for a 12.5 per cent rise in growth in India this year as vaccination stutters and new business restrictions are introduced, including in Maharashtra, home to the country's financial capital Mumbai. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eaec6871-8306-4c9b-b1c7-dcf9326f8164#post-def9e3fc-70cd-4535-8a71-c350ba6ac64a\">Indian shares</a> are tumbling as cases increase.</p> <h2>Business</h2> <p><strong>Black cab drivers</strong> in London are the latest victims of the pandemic-induced downturn in international travel. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/676fef2d-1032-41cf-96d3-493107ad4191\">Heathrow</a> is trebling pick-up fees to £10 as the airport tries to claw back some of the £1.4m it lost running the taxi rank last year, a move that drivers say will devastate their business.</p> <p>Spending on <strong>private jets </strong>by US companies increased during the pandemic with top executives at the likes of Morgan Stanley and PepsiCo using the planes for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/add37f73-25a6-4a0b-8710-138d9650420d\">personal travel</a> — including for holidays. One academic said: “It is not the plane, it is the vacation trip itself that I find interesting. Why are they going on vacation at all?”</p> <p>The surge in online grocery deliveries during the pandemic has given <strong>ecommerce</strong> groups masses of consumer data to improve their products and fuelled the rise of new companies such as Getir, which deliver baskets of essentials in just 10 minutes. Our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87cd997e-534a-4b9c-94ce-8ee419efe184\">Big Read</a> examines the opportunities and the hype surrounding the new rapid delivery apps. Other ecommerce companies such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6ec09c4-646a-44e6-8fe8-2a33605bfdbc\">Ozon</a> — “Russia's Amazon” — and Swedish group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ce32af2-e791-4f3c-bba5-6ed5b4cfd6f1\">Trustly</a> are expanding after pandemic success.</p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p>The Bank of England's quantitative easing programme has made it the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e042b87-ef75-4cb7-94be-d57b8f77235c\">biggest holder</a> of <strong>UK government debt </strong>(gilts), overtaking overseas investors and pension and insurance companies.

Being forced into saving a large chunk of my disposable income every month was an awkward adjustment at first, but over time, seeing my wealth grow has made me feel considerably more secure and happier. I also haven't missed routine consumption at all. I miss experiences like holidays, going to the pub, and having the odd meal out, but I certainly don't miss going to a restaurant four-five times a week and dropping money on the high street for stuff that I don't need. In short, the pandemic has turned me from an unhappy consumer into a happy saver. I suspect I'm not alone.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p>Pubs and restaurants in England — at least until May 17 — are obliged to serve customers outdoors. So if you're in the London area and in the mood for an <em>aperitivo</em>, here are the best outdoor spots for a refreshing spritz, courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75ca6d09-4f20-4211-9482-c5bad8d2c003\">FT Globetrotter</a>. <em>Cin cin!</em></p> <p><em>We would really like to hear from you.
