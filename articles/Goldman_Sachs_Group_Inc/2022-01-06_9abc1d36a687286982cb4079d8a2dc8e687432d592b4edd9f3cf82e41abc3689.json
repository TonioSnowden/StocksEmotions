  "text": "<p>Walgreens Boots Alliance has upgraded its full-year guidance after strong trading at both its US and international businesses as Covid-19 testing and online sales propelled first-quarter revenues higher.</p> <p>The Illinois-based group said it expected full-year adjusted earnings per share to grow by “mid-single digits” from last year's $4.91, against a previous forecast of no increase.</p> <p>Chief executive Rosalind Brewer said on Thursday that first-quarter performance had “exceeded expectations” with group sales rising 7.8 per cent to $33.9bn — about $1bn ahead of Wall Street forecasts — and operating profit of $1.3bn against a loss of $535m in the same quarter last year.</p> <p>Walgreens said the increases “reflect strong adjusted gross profit growth across both pharmacy and retail in the US and a continued rebound in international sales and profitability”.</p> <p>Same-store retail sales at its near-9,000 US stores rose 10 per cent — the highest quarterly growth in two decades — helped by both tests for and vaccinations against Covid.</p> <p>Branches of Walgreens and Duane Reade administered 15.6m vaccinations and conducted 6.5m Covid tests in the three months ending on November 30. Testing alone accounted for about 3 percentage points of the sales growth. </p> <p>Boots, the UK pharmacy chain that is the largest part of the group's international division, reported sales growth of 16 per cent, helped by a near doubling of online sales compared with pre-pandemic levels. </p> <p>Walgreens once again said that Boots had taken market share from other retailers such as supermarkets, department stores and discounters, which compete vigorously with Boots in areas such as personal goods and beauty.</p> <p>The group's Nasdaq-traded shares fell back after rising in pre-market trading. Although it beat forecasts and increased guidance, the company also warned that it was having to invest in more staff. The revised full-year forecast includes an impact of 2 percentage points from “incremental investments in team members”.</p> <p>Brewer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c9cde9b1-25de-4f72-94fd-e5a8e81d8752\">joined Walgreens from Starbucks</a> last March after her predecessor Stefano Pessina, whose dealmaking largely created the group in its current form, announced he would become executive chair.</p> <p>Under her tenure, the group has signalled a sharper focus on US healthcare. The group has already&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3da9a9b4-3459-4134-8855-2fbbcf7ffbaa\">sold its distribution business</a>&#xa0;to AmerisourceBergen and taken majority stakes in primary care provider VillageMD and speciality pharmacy group Shields.</p> <p>Brewer said its newly created Walgreens Health division was rolling out doctor-staffed clinics at its drug stores “at pace” and that the company was “in the final stages of welcoming a new leader” for the unit.</p> <p>Walgreens has also appointed Goldman Sachs to advise on options for Boots, a business with Methodist roots and a household name in the UK with more than 2,000 stores. A sale to a financial buyer or a separate stock market listing are both potential options. </p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2022 'Walgreens Boots Alliance lifts forecast on strong sales' FT.com 6 January.
