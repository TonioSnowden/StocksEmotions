  "text": "<p>Soon, however, Griner and her former team will confront a practical question that is without precedent in American sports: How or whether she wants to restart her basketball career after her harrowing foreign detainment.</p><p>\"We've had athletes who were detained for various reasons, but nothing of this scope,\" said Hap Davis, a psychologist who worked for more than two decades with Canadian national and professional teams and has also studied the psychological effects of trauma among victims of persecution and torture.</p><p>Nygaard—who, having taken the helm of the Mercury in January 2022, has not actually coached her franchise's star player—had not yet spoken to Griner, citing the more pressing matters of evaluating her medically and reuniting her with her family.</p><p>\"Her mental health and physical health is a priority,\" Nygaard said. \"If she wants to play basketball again, we're going to support her either way.\"</p><p>Still, the team's plans for the upcoming season, which tips off in May, will allow for her return. Griner is technically a free agent, her latest contract having run only through the 2022 season, but the organization will keep a roster spot available with the expectation that a return would bring her back to the Mercury, said team president Vince Kozar. \"There is no contingency where we end up not having room for her,\" Kozar said.</p><p>Nygaard has been preparing in a different way since last season. \"I have a note on my iPhone, of (plays) to run when BG returns,\" she said.</p><p>The story of Griner's detainment touched on manifold issues: the tense geopolitics surrounding Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the difficult calculations behind prisoner swaps, the often partisan line dividing the supporters and detractors of a Black, gay, outspoken and female professional athlete. The story of her return, experts say, will be new ground within the world of major professional sports—and a window into the extent to which the playing field can be a balm or a refuge.</p><p>There have been scarce details of Griner's daily life while she was held for months, first in a pretrial detention center near Moscow, and then in a penal colony 350 miles away in Mordovia. Her transfer to the penal colony in November was accompanied by reports that she could be required to undertake harsh physical labor there, risk contracting infectious respiratory diseases and endure mental torment.</p><p>Davis said that, while the extent of Griner's physical suffering is unknown, \"She certainly would have had fear, and that can be a long-term problem for most people coming back from that circumstance.\"</p><p>Griner's prowess on the court is unquestioned. In 2012 at Baylor, Griner led her team to a 40-0 record and a national title. Her professional career has been distinguished by two scoring titles, two Defensive Player of the Year awards, one championship and another Finals appearance, in her most recent season with the Mercury. In international play, Griner has helped the U.S. to two Olympic gold medals.</p><p>Over the weekend, at a military facility in San Antonio where she had been receiving medical testing, Griner worked out on a basketball court, which didn't surprise Kozar, who says basketball has been on her mind.</p><p>\"We were able to correspond while she was away, and the letters I've gotten from her all talk about basketball,\" Kozar said. \"She was checking on her team, talking about how much she wants to play, talking about how much she misses hooping.\"</p><p>However, he isn't expecting any quick decisions from her. \"It's 100% a matter of her making that decision for herself,\" he said. \"There's no timetable, there's no rush.\"</p><p>Any return to competition, Davis said, should be initiated fully by the athlete, not her club. \"You may not encourage her to think about playing again,\" Davis said. \"You wait for her to say this, voice this herself.\"</p><p>While acknowledging the uniqueness of Griner's circumstances, psychologists gave credence to a familiar notion, in the high-stress world of professional sports: the game and its attendant rituals as a sanctuary.</p><p>\"We look at sports psychology as psychology impacting sport, but there's a two-way street there. Sport can definitely influence mental health and well-being,\" said Scott Goldman, a performance psychologist for an NBA team who has worked across professional sports.</p><p>Goldman, who emphasized that he has not worked with Griner, described a professional locker room as a potentially powerful catalyst. \"It's about feeling a sense of belonging and connection to people, a sense of contentment,\" Goldman said.</p><p>A return to play for Griner would also carry the potential for discomfort. She would be thrust back into the public eye as a more well-known and, in some circles, controversial figure than she ever was prior to her detainment. Games would bring with them media obligations, the risk of underwhelming stat lines—Griner spent a year of her prime, after all, sitting in a cell—and reminders of her imprisonment even from well-intentioned fans.</p><p>\"It's almost like picking a scab that you're focused on healing,\" Goldman said.</p><p>Nygaard said that the WNBA and NBA have been on the forefront of the conversation prioritizing mental-health care in professional sports, leaving the leagues well-positioned to assist with Griner's return to the U.S. and, if she wishes, to basketball.</p><p>Davis said that it will be crucial that psychological support not feel tied to, or contingent upon, athletic fitness.</p><p>\"I would think that the best approach would be outside the team environment,\" Davis said. \"I would not encourage a sports psychologist to undertake this work, even if the sports psychologist were appropriately credentialed.\"</p><p>Sports history is shot through with examples of athletes returning from prolonged absences, but none of those cases offers real precedent.</p><p>\"Simple things like timing, body awareness, movement on the court will be affected by trauma, there's no way around that,\" Davis said. He added, \"I don't think any of us can predict, at this point, whether she will return to the same level of play.\"</p><p>Before Griner was detained in Russia, the Mercury's objectives were clear. They had just fallen short to the Chicago Sky in the 2021 WNBA Finals and were prepared to mount another run at a championship, built around the All-Star trio of Griner, Diana Taurasi and Skylar Diggins-Smith.</p><p>Now, what Griner does for her sport means less than what it does for her. \"Basketball is just so incredibly important to her,\" Kozar said. \"Does that mean she's going to play in five months? I don't know that answer. But knowing her as I do, and having had the correspondence we've had, it leaves me very optimistic.\"</p><p>Write to Robert O'Connell at robert.oconnell@wsj.com</p><p>Brittney Griner's Unprecedented Choice: How, or Whether, to Return to Basketball</p>",
