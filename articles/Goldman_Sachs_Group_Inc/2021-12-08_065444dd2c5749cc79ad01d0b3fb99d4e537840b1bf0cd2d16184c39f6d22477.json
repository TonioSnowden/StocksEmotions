  "title": "Richard Branson-Backed SPAC Takes Grove Collaborative Public; British billionaire will invest in the startup, a seller of sustainable consumer products, as part of the listing",
  "text": "<p>Grove is raising about $87 million in a private investment in public equity, or PIPE, associated with the merger. The PIPE investors include Lone Pine Capital LLC, General Atlantic, Sculptor Capital Management Inc. and former Unilever PLC Chief Executive Officer Paul Polman. A further $348 million will come from the Virgin Group SPAC's trust account.</p><p>The SPAC has about $400 million that could also contribute to Grove's cash proceeds from the deal, though SPAC investors can withdraw their money before it is completed. Low share prices can encourage withdrawals.</p><p>Grove plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GROV.</p><p>The company began as ePantry in 2012, but in 2016 launched under the Grove name as a Certified B Corp, a designation given to companies that are \"using business as a force for good.\"</p><p>Its digital marketplace offers a flexible-delivery subscription model and guides to help customers build sustainable routines. Grove began expanding into physical stores nationwide earlier this year in a partnership with Target Corp.</p><p>The company crafts its own private-label products as well as selling third-party brands such as Seventh Generation and Method that espouse sustainability, cruelty-free practices and ethical supply-chain principles.</p><p>Grove, which has more than 1.5 million active customers through its direct platform, expects to generate $385 million in revenue this year.</p><p>Also this year, Grove became a public-benefit corporation, a designation by the state of Delaware that means the company has fiduciary duties to both shareholders and the good of the wider society.</p><p>A new generation of businesses, including Rent the Runway Inc., Warby Parker Inc. and Allbirds Inc. have tapped the public markets this fall, riding a wave of investor interest in mission-driven, environmentally friendly and socially conscious companies.</p><p>Fellow eco-friendly consumer-goods business Honest Co., co-founded by actress Jessica Alba, went public in May. Its shares have since tumbled 63% as it faces tougher year-earlier comparisons: In 2020, consumers stockpiled on sanitizing and disinfecting products.</p><p>Retail companies are widely having trouble filling orders, with inventories tight from manufacturing disruptions and supply-chain delays. Grove has managed to keep items in stock through most of the pandemic with relatively short lead times, co-founder and CEO Stuart Landesberg said.</p><p>\"Because we've invested so much in innovation, we're fortunate to have a really strong network of suppliers across all of the various steps of the chain that's allowed us to continue to serve our customers,\" he said.</p><p>These socially driven companies appeal to consumers and investors who seek to direct their funds responsibly—especially given the rise of investment funds driven by environmental, social and governance standards.</p><p>\"The new norm for sexy is in making the world a better place,\" Mr. Branson said in an interview.</p><p>Mr. Branson's sprawling portfolio was hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic, which had devastated the travel and tourism industry long at Virgin's core. But those sectors have picked up as restrictions have eased and Covid-19 vaccines have been rolled out.</p><p>His companies have weathered the volatility and uncertainty wrought by the pandemic by diversifying.</p><p>\"Arguably we diversified into some of the most difficult pandemic businesses—airlines, cruise companies, hotels, fitness clubs and so on—but fortunately, we do say that we'd also got successful space companies and other companies that are doing well,\" Mr. Branson said.</p><p>\"The pandemic will not go on forever,\" he added.</p><p>The Virgin Group SPAC is the second one fully backed by Mr. Branson's Virgin Group. The first merged with California-based genetics-testing startup 23andMe Holding Co. earlier this year with a valuation of roughly $3.5 billion, including debt.</p><p>SPACs have exploded in the past year and become a favored source of financing for private companies looking to go public. They allow companies to raise large sums of money and accelerate growth by going public through combinations with shell companies, avoiding a traditional initial public offering.</p><p>Virgin Group has played the other side of the boom as well, using SPACS to take some of its businesses public. Mr. Branson's space-exploration company Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. went public through a SPAC led by venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya in 2019. In August, Virgin Orbit, Mr. Branson's satellite-launching startup, said it would list on the Nasdaq by merging with a SPAC run by former Goldman Sachs banker George Mattson and former Carlyle Group senior executive Gregory Summe.</p><p>Write to Kimberly Chin at kimberly.chin@wsj.com</p><p>Richard Branson-Backed SPAC Takes Grove Collaborative Public</p>",
