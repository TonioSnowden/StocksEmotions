  "text": "<p>Wall Street is booming, or at least parts of it are. Merger mania and stock trading lifted the big U.S. banks' third-quarter results. On Main Street, banks are still hunting for bigger loan growth, but many customers are spending more after holding out last year.</p><p>Here's what the biggest U.S. banks are telling us about the state of the economy.</p><p>Spending</p><p>Customer spending has eclipsed pre-pandemic levels, bank executives said, a trend they see continuing into the holidays. Spending on Citigroup credit cards jumped 20% from a year ago to a record. Late fees are up and more people are starting to carry balances. Executives said they were back to fighting for card customers.</p><p>\"That is a tremendous amount of spending that's going on,\" said Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan. \"And it's accelerating.\"</p><p>Lending</p><p>A still-fragile economy and wide-open debt markets have cut into demand for bank loans during the pandemic. At Wells Fargo and Bank of America, total outstanding loans were down from a year ago but up from the second quarter.</p><p>\"We all dream of faster loan growth,\" Mike Santomassimo, Wells Fargo's chief financial officer, said on a call with analysts.</p><p>One loan category, securities-based lending, is growing rapidly. Both Bank of America and Morgan Stanley posted double-digit growth in loans to clients borrowing against their stock-and-bond portfolios.</p><p>Trading</p><p>Frenetic markets boosted big U.S. banks through much of the coronavirus pandemic. Now, equity trading is still up, but fixed-income trading is slowing. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America both notched gains in overall trading revenue. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Citigroup and Wells Fargo reported lower trading revenue.</p><p>Deals</p><p>A global deal bonanza continued to mint money for banks' Wall Street operations. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup all reported record quarters for mergers-and-acquisitions fees. Goldman Sachs's league-leading team is due to report Friday. Executives said pipelines for potential future deals remain full. That is a sign company executives are confident enough in the economy to attempt transformative deals.</p><p>Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com, Ben Eisen at ben.eisen@wsj.com and Orla McCaffrey at orla.mccaffrey@wsj.com</p><p>What Bank Earnings Tell Us About the Economy</p>",
