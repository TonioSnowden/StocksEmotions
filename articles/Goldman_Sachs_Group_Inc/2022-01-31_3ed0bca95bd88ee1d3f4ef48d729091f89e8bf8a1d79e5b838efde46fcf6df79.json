  "title": "Nasdaq Composite rallies Monday in bid to end worst month since 2008 financial crisis on a higher note",
  "text": "<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP picked up 284 points, or 2.1%, to around 14,055.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was flat near 34,723.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index SPX was trading 30 points, or 0.7%, higher at 4,463, buoyed by gains in consumer discretionaryXX:SP500.25 shares and information technology XX:SP500.45.</p><p>For the month, the Dow is headed for a 4.4% decline, the S&amp;P 500 is looking at a 6.4% drop thus far in the month and the Nasdaq Composite was on track for an 10.2% drop, which would mark its worst monthly decline since 2008 and its worst January loss on record, if the decline holds.</p><p>Last week, the Dow rose by 1.3% and the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite finished fractionally higher. Heading into the final day of the month, the S&amp;P 500 has slumped by 7% in January.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Stocks were trying to push higher on Monday but with the Nasdaq Composite still poised for a double-digit monthly drop, which would represent its worst January on record and its steepest monthly fall since the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>Speculation about the direction of Federal Reserve interest rates has played a key part in driving market moves in recent weeks and are likely to continue to be factors for trading in the six weeks leading up the Fed's crucial March gathering, where a rate-hike regime is expected to ensue.</p><p>Investors are also fearful about what a weak downturn in January means for returns for the remainder of the year, based on seasonal trends.</p><p>“There's a lot of chatter about whether a down January portends a down year, but as we narrow in on February—taking a more granular look at historical trends shows that larger-than-average January declines were followed by more weakness than strength in February,” wrote Chris Larkin, managing director at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley in a Monday note.</p><p>“This may simply be another way of saying there's a possibility of more volatility on the horizon—an assertion that probably won't surprise traders who've been in the markets the past few weeks, especially with the market continuing to digest the Fed's potential action plan and intensified geopolitics,” the analyst wrote.</p><p>The president of the Atlanta Fed, Raphael Bostic, told the Financial Times that the central bank could lift rates in 0.50 percentage point increment, rather than the usual quarter point, if inflation proves stubborn, though he is sticking with his call for three, quarter-point rises for all of 2022.</p><p>“If markets were looking for reassurance from the Federal Reserve last week about the pace of policy tightening, they didn't get it, with [Chair Jerome] Powell insisting that all Fed policy options were open for March and beyond. While this seems entirely sensible; it wasn't the message increasingly nervous markets wanted to hear,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.</p><p>Read:What to expect from markets in the next six weeks, before the Federal Reserve revamps its easy-money stance</p><p>“In essence it was the Fed saying to markets that the days of hand-holding are over; and that their priority now is inflation, and not the jobs market, as we look towards Friday's jobs report, where the focus has been less on the headline jobs number in recent months, and more on the wages numbers.”</p><p>Earnings season ramps up this week. Strategists at Goldman Sachs say of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, 52% have offered guidance above analyst expectations even as most fourth-quarter results have trumped expectations.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Moderna stock MRNA rallied 2.6% on Monday as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted full approval of its COVID-19 vaccine.</p><p>Tesla TSLA shares rose 8.2% as Credit Suisse upgraded the electric vehicle maker to overweight from neutral. The analysts argued Tesla was caught in the market decline but has robust fundamentals.</p><p>Shares of Spotify were up over 12% after it said on Sunday that it would add content advisories to certain podcasts and improve transparency about its misinformation policy. Last week, rock icon&#xa0;Neil Young pulled his music&#xa0;from Spotify&#xa0;SPOT,&#xa0;citing the spread of disinformation on the streaming-music platform, specifically citing Joe Rogan's popular podcast.</p><p>Shares of Citrix SystemsCTXS,&#xa0;the cloud computing company, confirmed Monday it would be purchased for $16.5 billion, including debt, by Elliott Management and Vista Equity Partners. Shares of the company were down 3.8%.</p><p>Shares of Robinhood Markets Inc.HOODwere up nearly 9% after it was revealed that Cathie Wood's ARK Investment suite of funds purchased nearly 2.45 million shares of the beaten-down online brokerage, on Friday.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y rose 1.3 basis points to around 1.79%. Yields and debt prices move opposite each other.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.5%.</p><p>Oil futures CL. 1 rose 58 cents, or 0.7%, to $87.41 a barrel&#xa0;on the New York Mercantile Exchange Gold futures GC00&#xa0;rose 0.6%, or $10.30, to reach $1,796.90 an ounce.</p><p>In European equities, the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP rose 0.7%, while London's FTSE 100 UKX was trading less than 0.1% higher.</p><p>The Hang Seng Index HSI&#xa0;rose 1.1% and Japan's Nikkei 225 NIK. also rose 1.1% and markets in China and in other parts of Asia are closed for Lunar New Year.</p>",
