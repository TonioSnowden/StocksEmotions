  "text": "<p>The yen teetered on the edge of a historic support barrier on Thursday after trading in New York sent the Japanese currency to a 20-year low against the dollar and revived speculation that its fall could deepen.</p> <p>By noon, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/yen\">yen</a> stood at ¥134.45 against the dollar, bringing it closer to the ¥135.15 level it reached during the turmoil of Japan's 2002 banking crisis and approaching lows of more than ¥145 in 1998 during the Asian financial crisis. </p> <p>The yen <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c66b7f5b-3152-4763-a8cc-cdaa846d3fa1\">began its descent</a> in March, falling out of the tight range it had occupied for the previous six years as a result of the Bank of Japan deciding against tightening monetary policy.</p> <p>As interest rates rise in the US and elsewhere, traders are focusing on the widening differential between yields on those countries' sovereign bonds and Japan's.</p> <p>The low yen is driving up the cost of imported goods for the Japanese economy. Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda was forced to<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e92fb44-e8cf-4c3c-994e-be0a07bbd5a1\"> retract his claim</a> that consumers had become more “tolerant” of price rises after a public backlash.</p> <p>Shusuke Yamada, head of Japan FX and rates strategy at Bank of America, said that while recession fears in the US may have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54f5231e-6157-4312-b3e4-a74335ca9bcc\">damped the dollar's rise</a> over the past few weeks, investors expected the interest rate spread between Japan and the US to persist for a few years.</p> <p>“A slow slowdown in the US could be negative for the yen,” said Yamada. </p> <p>The drop on Thursday took the yen into a fifth straight day of declines, marking a period that has prompted several investment banks, including Nomura, to hastily revise their forecasts for the rest of the year.</p> <p>“Given the recent price action and the fundamentals supporting it, we now see a risk of USD/JPY remaining above ¥130 longer than we previously assumed,” said Nomura FX strategist Yujiro Goto.</p> <p>Nomura now expects the currency to stabilise in June at ¥132 against the dollar, having previously predicted it to trade at ¥125. </p> <p>The most bearish forecasts for the yen predict it could fall as low as ¥140-¥150, creating a short-term boost to profits across large parts of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/japan-banking-finance\">corporate Japan</a> but amplifying the hit from higher costs of imported energy and other commodities.</p> <p>In a recent report on the impact of the weak yen on corporate Japan, CLSA strategist Nicholas Smith said that a poll of companies covered by the brokerage found that the average forex assumption was fixed at about ¥110.05 against the dollar, suggesting that many companies will announce windfall profits in the quarter ending later this month.</p> <p>“Retailers are unsurprisingly the main losers, while automakers are the main winners from the weak yen,” said Smith.</p> <p>Currency analysts at Goldman Sachs said that there was a possibility of intervention by the Japanese authorities if the yen continued to fall much further, though they noted that Kuroda has reiterated the mantra that a weak yen benefits the economy if its moves are not too sharp.</p> <p>“We continue to see rising risk of intervention as USD/JPY grinds higher, but the consistent tone from policymakers despite the cross rallying towards ¥135 signals some tolerance for further depreciation,” said Goldman Sachs analysts in a note to investors on Thursday.</p><p>Source: Leo Lewis in Tokyo 2022 'Yen moves toward 24-year low against dollar ' FT.com 9 June.
