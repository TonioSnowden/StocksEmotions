  "text": "<p>Shareholders in Italy's biggest insurer, Generali, have voted to back chief executive Philippe Donnet, handing the company a big victory after a bitter governance fight with a group of rebel investors that has gripped corporate Italy for months.</p> <p>The list of directors proposed by Donnet and the board and supported by the company's largest shareholder, Italian merchant bank Mediobanca, was backed by 56 per cent of the votes at the company's annual meeting. </p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9f92ee0-feb7-4064-b139-56615cf48931\">rival list</a>, led by former Goldman Sachs banker Claudio Costamagna and former Generali executive Luciano Cirinà, garnered 42 per cent of the vote. It had been backed by construction tycoon Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone, another leading shareholder in the insurer. </p> <p>Speaking after the result, a smiling Donnet told shareholders: “The majority of you has clearly and without any ambiguity voted for the list of new directors presented by the outgoing board. This is a choice that is a further token of confidence in our management team and our [three-year] strategy.” </p> <p>While people close to the company said that Friday's result marked the end of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d530d758-e6b6-46b0-acc9-6ca914d84a59\">acrimonious battle</a>, those who know the rebel investors said that turmoil would continue in the months ahead. </p> <p>Caltagirone and two of his nominees will become directors alongside 10 proposed by the company. One analyst has warned that division could cause “dysfunction” on the board.</p> <p>In a statement following the result, Caltagirone said that Italian shareholders had “[stood] with us without exception, all of whom are stable and long-term Generali investors”.</p> <p>He added: “I am not convinced [foreign shareholders] completely understood the extent of change that a strong company like Generali requires after losing ground for the past 20 years” and that he would continue “working to make sure that change takes place”.</p> <p>Cirinà, who was dismissed from the company after he emerged as a rival candidate for the top job, said that “I hope that our advice will inspire the current management to push ahead for the common good of all shareholders and employees”. </p> <p>The annual meeting in Trieste followed months of manoeuvres by Generali's largest shareholders in what has been an increasingly fierce fight over the future of the group, which has 75,000 employees and 67mn customers worldwide.</p> <p>It has pitted Mediobanca against other large shareholders Caltagirone and eyewear billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio, who also backed Costamagna and Cirinà. </p> <p>Speaking in Trieste before the results were announced, outgoing chair Gabriele Galateri di Genola told shareholders the company had worked hard to modernise, improve results and change its governance structure. </p> <p>The top three shareholders boosted their voting power ahead of the vote, through share purchases, derivatives arrangements and, in Mediobanca's case, a move last year to borrow 4 per cent of the insurer's capital. </p> <p>The Caltagirone camp had said it would consider legal action had the borrowed shares proved decisive.</p> <p>In the end, the company list was backed by investors representing 39.5 per cent of the share capital, 10 percentage points more than the rival list.</p> <p>As well as choosing the company's new leaders, shareholders were effectively choosing whether to back the three-year strategic plan announced in December by Donnet, which aimed for higher cash generation and dividends, or a rival plan presented by Cirinà last month, which leaned more heavily on cost cuts and promised more money for dealmaking.</p> <p>One Del Vecchio ally branded it the “final showdown” between Mediobanca, run by Alberto Nagel, and its critics, who argue the bank has an outsized influence on the insurer. </p> <p>Speaking at the start of the meeting, Donnet pitched the board's list as the choice for “continuity” and “soundness” as well as being the company's most diverse yet, with women taking up just over half of the seats. Proxy investors ISS and Glass Lewis had backed the current board, with international investors such as Norway's oil fund voting the same way. </p> <p>Shareholders also voted to support the company's proposal to keep the board at 13 directors.</p><p>Source: Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli in Milan and Ian Smith in London 2022 'Generali shareholders back management after fight with rebel investors' FT.com 29 April.
