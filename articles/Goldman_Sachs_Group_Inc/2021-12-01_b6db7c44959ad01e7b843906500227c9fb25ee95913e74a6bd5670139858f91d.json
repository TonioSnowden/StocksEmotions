  "title": "Stock Markets Wobble as Omicron Fuels More Volatility; Investors struggle to assess implications of coronavirus variant on business, economies",
  "text": "<p>U.S. indexes trimmed their gains following the reports. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite briefly traded lower before turning higher again. The Dow recently added about 40 points, or 0.1%. The Nasdaq traded essentially flat. The benchmark S&amp;P 500 added 0.4%.</p><p>Investors have little to go on as they assess whether the variant will lead to renewed restrictions in the U.S. and elsewhere and, if so, how governments and central banks would respond to support the economy. Though drugmakers have said the variant first identified in southern Africa looks like it could make existing vaccines less effective, they expect to be able to update the shots. Investors believe a return to full-scale lockdowns is unlikely.</p><p>\"We just don't know how much more infectious it is, how severe the symptoms are and what the impact of that is,\" said Sebastian Mackay, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco, of the Omicron variant. \"What I'd assume now is this probably isn't enough to derail the recovery that's going on.\"</p><p>Invesco's multiasset funds have bought stocks at cheaper levels since Omicron first rattled markets last week, Mr. Mackay added.</p><p>Still, even amid Wednesday's volatility, all but two of the S&amp;P 500's 11 groups traded higher. The utilities and healthcare sectors, typically viewed as more defensive moves for stock investors, posted the largest gains.</p><p>Vaccine-maker Moderna pared some recent gains, slipping 7.4%. Salesforce.com lost 9.2% after the software company's guidance for fourth-quarter earnings fell short of expectations.</p><p>Brent oil prices, which have tumbled recently on signs Omicron could curtail demand for jet fuel, rose 0.2% to $69.35 a barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets Wednesday and Thursday to determine its response to recent price declines.</p><p>Analysts say the cartel, still holding back production in tandem with allies led by Russia, may pause plans to pump more oil in January, or further cut output. Goldman Sachs analysts said recent price declines suggest traders are preparing for daily global oil demand to fall by more than 7% over the next three months.</p><p>Another cause for concern, stock investors say, is that the rapid pace of inflation could prevent the Fed and other central banks from unleashing stimulus in the event of severe disruption caused by Omicron. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell added to those worries Tuesday when he opened the door to an interest-rate risein the first half of 2022.</p><p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Wednesday it expects consumer-price inflation in the U.S. to average 4.4% in 2022, up from the 3.1% forecast in September. The forecasts were made before the Omicron variant was discovered. However, the research body's chief economist said the world could experience price declines if the new variant sidesteps existing vaccines.</p><p>Wednesday's move back into riskier assets weighed slightly on the government bond market. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes ticked up to 1.447% from 1.440% Tuesday. Yields move inversely to bond prices.</p><p>Bitcoin also rose. It recently traded at about $57,859, according to CoinDesk, up 1.3% from its 5 p.m. ET price Tuesday.</p><p>Overseas markets gained. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.7%, led higher by shares of travel, leisure and basic-resource companies, which would all be exposed to an economic downturn.</p><p>Asian markets were broadly higher. South Korea's Kospi added 2.1% while Japan's Nikkei 225 and China's Shanghai Composite rose 0.4%.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com and Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Markets Wobble as Omicron Fuels More Volatility</p>",
