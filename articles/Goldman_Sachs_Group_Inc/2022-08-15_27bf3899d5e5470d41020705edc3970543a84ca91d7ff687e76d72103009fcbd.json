  "title": "Inside SocGen's succession plan: why the French bank needs a fresh start",
  "text": "<p>In January 2020, as they shunted between meetings at the grand Hyatt hotel near Moscow's Bolshoi theatre and the headquarters of Russia's Rosbank, board members of Société Générale debated a question that would come back to haunt the French bank.&#xa0;</p> <p>Should <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/07ed6928-204e-4c1b-880b-c81a496b4650\">SocGen </a>part ways with its Russian subsidiary, unloved by investors but championed by chief executive Frédéric Oudéa, and which was finally eking out a profit?&#xa0;</p> <p>The push to keep Rosbank won the day, despite some internal grumbles, several people familiar with the discussions said. </p> <p>But, in the end, SocGen's attachment to Russia was to hasten the start of a process to replace <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/c75ae44d-3f64-4a71-9e3d-c9b34b1ed8d0\">Oudéa</a>, one of Europe's longest-serving bank chief executives, after the invasion of Ukraine pushed it into a costly rush to exit this year, other people close to the lender said.&#xa0;</p> <p>SocGen, one of France's biggest banks, is now looking to settle a succession dilemma meant to help it draw a line under years of crises, resets and restructurings and build on a recent turnround in its earnings — notwithstanding a €1.5bn second-quarter loss due to Russia.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Forced back into firefighting mode by the episode after 14 years at the top, Oudéa agreed to step down in 2023, after initially sounding out directors on a two-year extension, three people familiar with discussions said. </p> <p>SocGen's board, led by chair Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, is adamant a fresh start is needed. It has taken the unusual step in the insular world of French banking, which is used to carefully choreographed and internal handovers, of opening up the search publicly and looking beyond SocGen walls. Overseas candidates might even be in the frame, say people close to the bank.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>“The board insisted on seeing all the best options in the market,” said one person familiar with the process, adding that directors were seeking a clean break with the past that would give them more influence on strategy.&#xa0;</p> <p>“They think it might change the dynamic of the ‘muddling through' of the bank, which has been the case for years.”</p> <p>Since Oudéa took charge in May 2008, the stock has plunged 71 per cent and its valuation is among the worst of any major lender in Europe. It has a market capitalisation of €19bn, similar to a bevy of regional US lenders and well below €60bn for French rival BNP Paribas and $109bn for Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>In the past four years, the bank has issued several profit warnings and in 2019 had to slash <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2684702-5aa3-11e9-9dde-7aedca0a081a\">thousands of jobs</a> from its once-vaunted trading division that specialises in financial engineering and exotic derivatives. </p> <p>A year later at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, it had to rein in risk at the unit even further after the equities business suffered hundreds of millions in losses when companies abruptly cancelled dividends at the start of the pandemic.</p> <p>Owing to its falling market share and cheap valuation, it has been linked with numerous suitors, including Italy's UniCredit, with which it explored a deal in 2018.</p> <p>With SocGen on a better trajectory, but the turnround far from complete, the possibility of an outsider getting the job carries more weight than Parisian bankers had long thought possible. The pool of five main contenders includes two serious internal candidates.</p> <p>One, Sébastien Proto, a former Rothschild banker hired four years ago who graduated from the same elite school as French president Emmanuel Macron, has a prominent task to merge and digitise SocGen's two French bank networks that could put him in pole position, people familiar with the candidates said. </p> <p>The other, Slawomir Krupa, runs SocGen's investment bank, another key division.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>SocGen declined to comment on the process, which is provisionally due to conclude by October but may be finalised next month. Oudéa, who will have a say only as a board member, has expressed a preference for the hire to be internal, two people said, after he had started to groom Proto and Krupa for the job.&#xa0;</p> <p>The biggest task for any successor will be to give SocGen the strategic impetus some analysts, bankers and insiders believe it has lacked in recent years, when some rivals such as larger domestic lender BNP Paribas have stolen a march on expanding their business with companies across Europe. </p> <p>Rising interest rates herald a possible period of greater profitability for Europe's financial sector, which SocGen will want to capitalise on as it seeks to build out its home market business. It will also have to navigate potential turmoil from dysfunctional energy markets and soaring inflation. </p> <p>For much of Oudéa's tenure, overhauls have come as a result of crises, and a group that was once a pioneer in equity derivatives has emerged from the past decade with a slimmed-down investment bank and less of a commanding franchise in that area.</p> <p>The chief executive is credited with some successes, such as building out France's biggest online-only retail bank by client numbers, Boursorama.&#xa0;He also recently launched a plan to vastly expand SocGen's car leasing operations with the €4.9bn acquisition of LeasePlan.</p> <p>As a result, underlying earnings have stabilised and improved in recent quarters, while the repositioning of the investment bank has dramatically cut risk and ended a string of embarrassing losses.</p> <p>Citi analysts said this month that SocGen was now one of their top investment picks “given its strategic progress, its corporate and investment bank turnround” but that the upside was largely down to its rock-bottom valuation.</p> <p>SocGen's stock has never recovered since a notorious rogue trading scandal in January 2008, just as the US subprime mortgage crisis was starting to wreak havoc on banks globally. </p> <p>Oudéa — who in the 1990s worked for Nicolas Sarkozy in government —rose to the top in the aftermath of the rogue trading scandal, which lost SocGen €4.9bn and was followed by the departure of another chief executive candidate, Jean-Pierre Mustier.</p> <p>Mustier, who went on to run Italy's UniCredit for four years, has not put himself forward for the job now, two people close to the matter said.&#xa0;</p> <p>Ten years later, another setback cost a different would-be chief executive his chance. When US regulators demanded a scalp in the wake of their Libor rate-rigging probes, Didier Valet, then deputy chief executive left the bank. SocGen later paid $2.6bn to settle several French and US cases, including Libor.</p> <p>Outside the ranks of SocGen candidates, several bankers cited Jacques Ripoll — a former employee who recently left a job running Crédit Agricole's investment bank — as a strong potential contender, although he is joining French energy group Eren.&#xa0;</p> <p>Laurent Mignon, the head of rival French banking group BPCE, was also approached by SocGen as he is seen as having the right attributes for the job. Ripoll and Mignon declined to comment.&#xa0;</p> <p>Proto's shortcomings include that he has never worked in the markets side of the business, and the 44-year-old is still a relatively new arrival at the bank, only recently taking a position that entails overseeing large teams. </p> <p>But he has a broad overview of other parts of SocGen's operations, people who know him said. The former investment banker has advised banks such as Crédit Agricole on complex reorganisations.&#xa0;</p> <p>A non-French candidate was also being considered, two people familiar with the discussions said, as well as a high-ranking investment banker.</p> <p> The stakes are high for Oudéa's successor. While recent results provide some cause for optimism, SocGen continues to trade at a “distressed valuation”, said Bank of America analyst Tarik El Mejjad, and to boost its capital buffer sufficiently ahead of tough new Basel IV regulations will require “flawless delivery of its targets”.</p> <p>“Frédéric did a very good job after taking over the bank at a time of extreme difficulty. But he stayed too long,” said a former SocGen executive who is close to Oudéa.</p> <p>“The board needs to find somebody younger who can give a new direction to the bank. It is clear that some of the issues of the business remain.”</p><p>Source: Sarah White in Paris and Stephen Morris and Owen Walker in London 2022 'Inside SocGen's succession plan: why the French bank needs a fresh start' FT.com 15 August.
