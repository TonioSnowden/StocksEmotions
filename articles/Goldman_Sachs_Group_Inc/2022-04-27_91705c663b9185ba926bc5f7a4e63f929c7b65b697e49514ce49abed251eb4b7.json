  "title": "'Energy is being increasingly weaponized.' Analysts weigh up risks after Russia cuts gas to two EU countries; Europe gas prices could top €200/MWh this summer if Germany cut off, warns Goldman",
  "text": "<p>State-controlled Russian giant Gazprom RU:GAZP, said Tuesday that it had cut natural gas deliveries to Poland and Bulgariaas they refused to pay in Russian rubles, as demanded by President Vladimir Putin. In response, the leaders of those countries accused Moscow of trying to \"blackmail\" their countries. Poland, has been actively supporting Ukraine's battle, though has provided more limited support amid a fragmented political backdrop.</p><p>That sentiment was echoed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who said in a statement on Wednesday that it was \"no surprise that the Kremlin uses fossil fuels to blackmail us.</p><p>\"This is something the EU Commission has been preparing for, with Member States and international partners. Our response will be immediate, united and coordinated,\" she said, adding that Poland and Bulgaria are receiving gas from their EU neighbors. Both countries say they have supplies, though Bulgaria's energy minister said they had supplies for only a month.</p><p>While \"very unlikely,\" a full interruption of Russian flows to Germany could drive European gas prices to over €200 /MWh this summer, warned a team of Goldman Sachs commodities strategists, led by Samantha Dart. The region is already battling high inflation, a by product of two years of a pandemic and then Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>\"Today's events can work as an added incentive for the EU, and especially Germany, to find a way to work out a RUB payment mechanism given the significant economic toll a halt in gas flows would have in the region, which would be much greater than that of Poland or Bulgaria,\" said Dart, in a note to clients.</p><p>The Polish gas cutoff affects the Yamal pipeline, which hasn't played a big role in suppling gas to Europe in recent months, Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said in a note. Gas flows to Germany via that pipeline account for less than 2% of Russia's pipeline deliveries to Europe since the beginning of the year.</p><p>Meanwhile, four European gas buyers have already paid the required rubles for Russian gas supplies, and other potential cutoffs aren't likely until the next round of payments are due later in May, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing a source close to Gazprom.</p><p>EU countries have been working toward cutting their dependence on Russian gas and oil, but that hasn't been a smooth process as countries such as Germany and Italy are far more reliant.</p><p>Politically, the latest development \"raises the stakes for the EU Commission's decision on whether the new gas payment system would violate sanctions and, hence, will likely keep market volatility elevated,\" said Goldman strategists.</p><p>In Europe's favor is the fact that the winter months are now over, while summer months will bring less need for gas, but problems may loom for later in the year if the war continues.</p><p>The gas cutoff came in a week that has seen pledges of stronger support for Ukraine by western allies and a visit to the embattled country by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, warned of the increasing risk of World War III and of a nuclear conflict.</p><p>''Energy is being increasingly weaponized as the war in Ukraine looks set to enter the long haul and expectations grow that a crude oil embargo will end up being slapped on Russia by the EU,\" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, in a note to clients.</p><p>The latest development is a reminder of \"the escalation of the war in Ukraine that drives energy prices higher and looms over this market in the near term,\" said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a note.</p><p>\"We continue to recommend exposure to commodities and energy equities because they can do well in our base and bear case scenarios. However, Europe still has many diplomatic and fiscal policy responses available to prevent an energy induced recession and based on current information; a European recession is not our base case,\" he said.</p><p>The German government on Wednesday cut its 2022 growth outlook to 2.2%, from 3.6% that was forecast in January. Inflation is expected to average 6.1% this year, then 2.8% in 2023.</p><p>'Energy is being increasingly weaponized.' Analysts weigh up risks after Russia cuts gas to two EU countries</p>",
