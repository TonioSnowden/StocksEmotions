  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Macau's losing streak isn't over yet. High-rollers from China and their financiers -- previously a big revenue source for casinos -- seem likely to focus on keeping their own heads from rolling rather than resuming their profligate ways next year. </p><p>\n  Shares of casino operators in the semiautonomous Chinese city plunged Monday after the government said that the chairman of the city's biggest junket operator was being held for questioning. Wynn Macau fell 8% while MGM China dropped 10%. </p><p>\n  Trouble is brewing up north: The Chinese city of Wenzhou has issued an arrest warrant for Alvin Chau, chairman of junket operator Suncity, accusing him of running a cross-boundary gambling syndicate to illegally recruit Chinese residents to gamble outside of mainland China. Chinese state media previously condemned Suncity two years ago for facilitating capital outflows with an online gambling platform. </p><p>\n  Investors are worried China could step up scrutiny of capital outflows to Macau more broadly, or to other places, by taking action against companies that deliver high rollers to gambling venues. Goldman Sachs estimates that around 70% of Macau's VIP volume is related to such junkets, which recruit and lend money to gamblers from mainland China, and Suncity alone facilitates around a third of the VIP market. The bank now expects Macau's gambling revenue from such high rollers next year will only recover to 15% of 2019's level, down from its original forecast of 45%. </p><p>\n  One consolation is that casinos are already much less reliant on VIP gamblers from the north than before. A decade ago, almost three-quarters of Macau's gambling revenue came from high rollers. That share has been trending down for years now and accounted for less than half of revenue in 2019. The pandemic drove the figure further down to around a third in the latest quarter, according to government data. Operators have built up glitzy resort-style casinos that cater to casual gamblers, something the government is encouraging. </p><p>\n  But tourists aren't coming back to Macau yet either. The city's gambling revenue in the first 10 months of 2021 was 71% lower than the same period in 2019. Mainland visitors have started coming back as they can travel quarantine-free since last year. But volume remains far below pre-pandemic levels as online visa applications haven't resumed yet. Recent flare-ups of Covid-19 in the mainland and Macau have further damped visitor numbers. </p><p>\n  The pending revision to Macau's gambling laws is also clouding the outlook for the sector. Investors fret that stricter oversight and higher costs are on the way. Macau's six casino operators have on average lost nearly half of their market value this year, an even worse performance than last year. </p><p>\n  Macau, like many-tourism dependent destinations, has had a particularly rough 18 months. It could still be quite a while until the odds are once again in its favor. </p><p></p>",
