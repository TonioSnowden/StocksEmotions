  "title": "Brink's Stops Russia-Related Transactions to Comply With U.S. Sanctions, CFO Says; The cash management company had been monitoring transactions since Tuesday",
  "text": "<p>Brink's transports U.S. dollar and other currencies for its clients around the world, \"either to central banks or other banks. That is now impacted by the sanctions,\" Mr. Domanico said.</p><p>Brink's doesn't serve VEB and Promsvyazbank, the two Russian banks that were sanctioned by the Treasury Department on Tuesday. Promsvyazbank finances Russia's military and VEB is Russia's development corporation.</p><p>The company, however, does count VTB and Sberbank, the Russian banks sanctioned by the Treasury on Thursday, as clients, if only \"technically,\" according to Mr. Domanico, since the banks have only received transfers instead of sending them. Brink's previously delivered bank notes to VTB and Sberbank on behalf of a foreign bank. The CFO declined to provide the name of that bank.</p><p>Mr. Domanico described the Russian invasion of Ukraine as concerning. \"It is very disruptive to our employees on the ground,\" he said. Brink's fears it could be targeted by the Russian government. \"We could become a political target and we don't want that,\" Mr. Domanico said.</p><p>The U.S., U.K. and European Union earlier this week introduced a range of sanctions, including against Russian banks and other organizations, the country's sovereign debt, and individuals, following Russia's attack on Ukraine. Those sanctions were broadened on Thursday.</p><p>The U.S. sanctions haven't had an economic impact on Brink's yet, according to Mr. Domanico. Some Western businesses, including big oil companies BP PLC, Exxon Mobil Corp. and Shell PLC, as well as brewer Carlsberg A/S and car manufacturer Renault SA, have substantial investments in Russia.</p><p>Overall, companies' direct exposure to the country outside of the energy sector is limited, Moody's Investors Service said Wednesday, referring to the portfolio of over 3,400 businesses it rates globally.</p><p>In Russia, Brink's primarily ships precious metals, diamonds and jewelry using armored trucks, including between mines and refineries, the CFO said. Its business in the country is relatively small and is reported as part of its \"rest of the world\" category. That segment generated $750 million in revenue in 2021, up from $604 million a year earlier, according to the company's fourth-quarter earnings report. Operating profit for that segment was $132 million in 2021, up from $117 million during the prior-year period.</p><p>Brink's covers more than 80 regions in Russia and has been offering a full range of services since 2008, according to the website of its Russian subsidiary. The company generates less than 1% of its annual revenue in Russia, Mr. Domanico said. \"Because we want to be global, we operate in Russia,\" he said.</p><p>Brink's serves customers in over 100 countries around the world, including in Ukraine, where it ships bank notes and precious metals. That business is \"much, much smaller\" than the company's Russian operations, according to Mr. Domanico.</p><p>The Richmond, Va.-based company on Wednesday reported revenue of $4.2 billion in 2021, up 14% compared with 2020. Operating profit, at $355 million, rose 66% from last year.</p><p>Brink's plans to focus on winning customers for new products this year, including a subscription-based cash-management tool and outsourced automated teller machine services for banks, Mr. Domanico said.</p><p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note to clients, \"[Brink's] is advancing its digital cash management strategy, or Strategy 2.0, which we believe will lead to stickier, higher growth and higher margin revenue streams.\"</p><p>Brink's is increasing its addressable market with the subscription-based cash-management tool, said Tobey Sommer, a managing director at Truist Securities, a financial-services firm. That will also help the company bring down its expenses and improve its routes, he said.</p><p>Write to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com</p><p>Brink's Stops Russia-Related Transactions to Comply With U.S. Sanctions, CFO Says</p>",
