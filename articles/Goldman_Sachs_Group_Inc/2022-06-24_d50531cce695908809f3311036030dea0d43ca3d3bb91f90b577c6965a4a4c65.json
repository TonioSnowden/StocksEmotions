  "title": "Business News:  Chinese Firms Cut Digital Ad Spending  ----  By Yifan Wang",
  "text": "<p>   Companies in China are cutting back on digital-ad spending as the economy slows and recurring Covid-19 outbreaks weigh on consumption, another sign of waning business confidence in the world's most populous nation. </p><p>   Chinese internet giants that operate several of the country's biggest online-advertising platforms recently warned of weak ad spending by their customers in the second quarter. Some also suggested it could be a while before a recovery takes hold, signaling pessimism about the broader economic outlook. </p><p>   Businesses in China spent about 20% less on all forms of advertising in April versus the same month a year ago, according to CTR Market Research Co., a joint venture between China International Television Corp. and Kantar Group. That followed a 13% drop in March, which marked the beginning of a two-month Covid-related lockdown in Shanghai. CTR has yet to release data for May. </p><p>   China's online advertising market is estimated to be around $150 billion in size, according to Goldman Sachs Equity Research, making it one of the largest in the world. The investment bank expects growth in overall online advertising revenue in the country to slow to 8% in 2022, from more than 25% in each of the previous two years. </p><p>   Weibo Corp., which operates a popular microblogging site, said in early June that most advertisers, including multinational companies, have deferred or reduced their marketing budgets since March, echoing similar statements from social-media giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. and search-engine operator Baidu Inc. </p><p>   Tencent, whose WeChat do-everything app is used by more than one billion people in China and has long been a popular platform for online advertisements, said in May that advertisers in categories including fast-moving consumer goods, e-commerce and travel pulled back significantly in the second quarter. </p><p>   It cited the Covid situation and impact of supply-chain disruptions as the main reasons. \"Covid is hurting consumption, which is unhelpful. It's also hurting logistics . . . which is more unhelpful. And then finally, it is impacting the city in China where most multinationals actually have their headquarters and to make their marketing decisions, which is further unhelpful,\" James Mitchell, Tencent's chief strategy officer, said on a conference call in mid-May. </p><p>   The social-media giant's online advertising revenue already fell 18% in the first quarter from a year ago to the equivalent of $2.7 billion, hurt by the impact of Chinese regulatory crackdowns on sectors such as private tutoring and gaming that reduced demand for advertising. </p><p>   Baidu, meanwhile, said the business activities of many of its customers were significantly disrupted in the second quarter, and its ad business has suffered as a result. The search giant sells online ads to a wide range of industries across China. </p><p>   Kuaishou Technology, whose popular short-video platform has been increasing online ad sales, sounded a pessimistic note after reporting slower growth in the first quarter. </p><p>   Some Western internet giants such as Snap Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook parent Meta are also contending with a slowdown in online advertising. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Cao Li, Raffaele Huang and Serena Ng contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
