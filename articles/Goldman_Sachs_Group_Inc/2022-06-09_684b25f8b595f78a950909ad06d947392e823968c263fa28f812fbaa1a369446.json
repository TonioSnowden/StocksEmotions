  "text": "<p>Apple is making <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc4eeb5c-479a-4daf-9f8b-808ee937530f\">its biggest move into finance</a> by offering loans directly to consumers for its new “buy now, pay later” product, taking on a role played in its other lending services by banking partners such as Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>Short-term loans made through the iPhone maker's new Apple Pay Later service will be made through a wholly owned subsidiary, Apple Financing LLC.</p> <p>Apple Pay Later, which will be managed through the Wallet app that comes pre-installed on every iPhone, will be accepted by millions of US retailers. </p> <p>Big Tech's move into the core banking business has been long feared on Wall Street after years of an uneasy alliance in areas such as mobile payments. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs, which has worked with the tech company to launch a credit card in the US, is facilitating Apple Pay Later by allowing Apple to access Mastercard's network. Apple does not have a banking licence and said it did not need to apply for one at this time.</p> <p>Crucially, Apple, which had net cash of $73bn at the end of March, is handling underwriting and lending using its new subsidiary. If a customer fails to pay back the loan, Apple must swallow the loss.</p> <p>However, buyers of Apple's premium-priced gadgets tend to have high incomes making them less of a lending risk. Apple can also use customer data, such as how long users have owned an iPhone or how often they buy apps from the App Store, to help determine whether a customer is in good standing.</p> <p><em>Share your feedback on this newsletter be emailing </em><a href=\"mailto:firstft@ft.comm\"><em>firstft@ft.com</em></a><em>. Here's the rest of the day's news — Gordon</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Fire at US natural gas plant deals blow to exports</strong> One of the biggest US liquefied natural gas plants will be closed for at least three weeks after an explosion, Freeport LNG said yesterday, dealing a blow to exports at a time when the industry is trying to boost supplies to Europe. US futures for July delivery were trading at about $8.28 per million British thermal units <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d89b4b3d-1503-4d6f-b83a-9a17b0ec318f\">this morning</a>, down 11 per cent from Tuesday's settlement price, as traders contemplated domestic supplies being trapped onshore.</p> <p><strong>1. China digs in for permanent zero-Covid</strong> China is building hundreds of thousands of permanent coronavirus testing facilities and expanding quarantine centres across many of its biggest cities as part of its zero-Covid policy. Experts believe the government's virus infrastructure programme is designed to sustain the mass testing and quarantine policies through 2023, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3f3b52c-e4bb-40c2-b2e9-afc2b22f0c19\">our correspondents in China report</a>.</p> <p><strong>2. Palantir gears up to expand its reach into the UK's NHS</strong> The secretive company, co-founded by Peter Thiel and best known for its ties to the security, defence and intelligence sectors, is gearing up to become the <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/3f6f24f8-9e5c-42c3-8ae6-bfef5f953524\">underlying operating system for the UK's NHS</a>. Its software was used during the pandemic in the management of ventilators and PPE equipment and helped deliver the nationwide vaccination programme.</p> <p><strong>3. SEC chief launches review of ‘uneven' US equities market </strong>Gary Gensler has outlined <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/748d7f04-8ce3-4934-8e88-0b9f6fb93206\">plans for an overhaul</a> of what he described as an unfair US equity market, drawing fire from traders and brokers over significant changes, including the possible introduction of an auction process to increase competition between services for retail investors.</p> <p><strong>5. Twitter to share data with Musk </strong>Twitter has agreed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0e3991b-ff7a-4371-b410-0b8ad1b108ea\">share a trove of data with Elon Musk</a> after the billionaire threatened to abandon his $44bn acquisition of the social media company if it did not provide information about fake accounts and bots. A shareholder vote on the deal is expected by early August.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>January 6 committee hearings </strong>Members of Congress will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4695b4bf-016b-4582-b75e-a9f27952f927\">sum up their initial findings</a> on how the attack on the US Capitol on January 6 2021 unfolded in a rare televised hearing. The committee will argue that former president Donald Trump was at the centre of a “co-ordinated, multi-step effort” to overturn the 2020 election result in the 90-minute primetime broadcast.</p> <ul>  <li><p>The spirit of Watergate will be missing from the televised hearings, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aa1fe12c-d5a2-4a1a-b6df-70b38894c4fd\">writes Edward Luce</a>. “Watergate proved that the American republic could withstand assault by a popular and very effective sitting president,” he writes. “The system worked. January 6 shows that an unpopular former president can wield a veto over the fate of democracy.”</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Biden and Bolsanaro meeting</strong> The leaders of the western hemisphere's two most populous nations will try to set aside their differences in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad157f4f-2361-41fe-9be1-e1325f7f6517\">their first bilateral meeting</a> at the Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles. Our reporters outline the significance of the meeting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad157f4f-2361-41fe-9be1-e1325f7f6517\">for both leaders</a>.</p> <p><strong>ECB to end easy money era</strong> The president of the European Central Bank Christine Lagarde is expected to set out plans to end eight years of bond-buying and negative interest rates in the eurozone <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2869a8f3-bf59-437f-a795-4a3fbdc35cd4\">at a meeting of policymakers today in Amsterdam</a>. The last time the central bank raised interest rates was in 2011.</p> <p><strong>Economic data</strong> New applications for unemployment aid are forecast to have edged up to 210,000 in the week ended June 4, from the previous week when they fell to 200,000. Consumer prices in Mexico are expected to have moderated in May, with economists predicting a 0.15 per cent rise, after a 0.54 per cent increase in April. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy, is also forecast to cool. The softer readings come as Mexico's central bank has aggressively raised rates to combat surging inflation.</p> <p><strong>Retail earnings</strong> Subscription fashion services Stitch Fix and Rent the Runway report results after the bell. Stitch Fix is expected to post a decline in quarterly revenue and a loss for the quarter. Rent the Runway is also forecast to post a quarterly loss, but consumers looking for cheaper alternatives amid sky high inflation are expected to buoy the luxury group's sales.&#xa0;</p> <h1>What else we're reading and listening to</h1> <p><strong>‘The product is dead. There's no more Spacs'</strong> Spac mania was an 18-month frenzy of dealmaking that catapulted hundreds of companies on to the stock market and enriched Wall Street banks. But rising interest rates, a weakening stock market and warnings of a regulatory crackdown have fed disillusionment with the investment vehicles. Now, as some banks adopt a far warier approach, focus is starting to shift to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a560343-69eb-4e36-9833-cc579a7dc8ad\">what the future holds for the once hot asset class</a>.</p> <p><strong>Canada's oil sands </strong>Covid-19 triggered an oil crash that forced operators to sack thousands of workers, throttle production and slash capital spending. Now, Alberta's producers are using a windfall from surging prices to repair their balance sheets and beef up dividends. Can <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/276ecc11-15cd-45ef-8e10-5f64dcde77da\">America's largest oil supplier</a> grant energy security without derailing its climate commitments?</p> <p><strong>Lina Khan vows ‘muscular' antitrust approach to private equity deals</strong> The chair of the Federal Trade Commission said she would explore how to improve the agency's toolkit to heighten scrutiny of buyout-backed mergers, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef9e4ce8-ab9a-45b3-ad91-7877f0e1c797\">in an interview with the Financial Times</a>. Regulators should be “sceptical”, when private equity funds seek to absorb businesses divested by companies that are merging, she said.</p> <p><strong>Blowing the whistle on ESG </strong>In this week's episode of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c313d28b-97e0-4398-8b1e-b71e2bb8d6fa\">FT's Behind the Money podcast</a>, host Michela Tindera talks to a whistleblower who raised red flags on DWS's misleading claims about its “green” financial products, while Patrick Temple-West joins to explain what it means for the future of environmental, social and governance investing. <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/subscribe?newsletterIds=5ce7dcb373511b000490ac5b\"><em>Sign up here</em></a><em> to receive our sustainable finance newsletter, Moral Money.</em></p> <p><strong>Who would want to own a hotel now?</strong> It is still a grim time to be in hospitality after stringent lockdowns and international travel bans slashed demand. But Sonesta, a little-known yet rapidly expanding hotel company, thinks it has <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/7369f018-07ef-46b7-bca7-5087f80158ed\">cracked the code to post-pandemic travel</a>.</p> <h1>Food &amp; drink</h1> <p>Are you caught between omnivores, intolerants, veggies and vegans?
