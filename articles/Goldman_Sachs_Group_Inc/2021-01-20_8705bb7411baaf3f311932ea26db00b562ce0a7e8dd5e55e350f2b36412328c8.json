It's one of the first large financial institutions to shutter operations in the territory since it entered a period of civil unrest and political tension in 2019.</p> <p><strong>Welcome to the Due Diligence briefing from the Financial Times.

(If you missed it over the holiday, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee914ea4-4ad9-4eec-97c3-95af841122bf\">read this deep-dive</a> from DD's Kaye Wiggins.)</p> <p><strong>Hellman &amp; Friedman</strong>'s latest such deal is an example of how lucrative they can be. Just before the holidays, it sold <strong>Verisure</strong>, a Swedish alarms company, from its seventh fund to a group of its other funds including its $16.5bn Fund IX.</p> <p>In the process, Verisure's owners — H&amp;F's funds, as well as <strong>GIC</strong> and the Spanish investment group <strong>Alba</strong> — will take out a more than €1.6bn dividend. The cut will be one of Europe's biggest “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9ff463b-01d7-4892-82dc-2dbb74941a16\">dividend recapitalisations</a>”, in which companies take on more debt to hand money to their shareholders.&#xa0;</p> <p>The idea is to give a discount on buying the company's shares to H&amp;F's ninth fund and the specialist investors buying into the deal.&#xa0;</p> <p>“It's enormous,” said one bond fund manager. “The owners have been quite transparent that they're going to take all the dividends they can get.”&#xa0;</p> <p>It shows private equity capitalising on two facets of the low interest rate world. First off, there's a willingness from Europe's debt investors — who are searching for higher-yielding assets — to fund the dividends. Secondly, there's a flood of capital from pension funds into specialist investment groups that finance so-called continuation fund deals, in which private equity groups sell to their own funds.&#xa0;</p> <p>After the latest dividend, Verisure will have paid out at least €3bn to its owners since 2015.&#xa0;</p> <p>But investors in H&amp;F's older fund are hardly losing out in the sale to its new funds. The transfer values the company at a hefty €14bn, or 14.5 times its favoured heavily-adjusted earnings figure of €968m. That's a big jump from its $5.3bn valuation in 2015 when H&amp;F took a majority stake — and likely translates into a sizeable return.&#xa0;</p> <p>The conundrum of how to keep both sides of a transaction happy becomes a lot easier when you're selling to yourself.&#xa0;</p> <p>Read the full story by the FT's Nikou Asgari and DD's Rob Smith and Kaye Wiggins <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d164a66c-7bba-484f-9ea0-d84e33de4834\">here</a>.&#xa0;</p> <h2>MGM: the house doesn't always win</h2> <p>The current state of the US sports betting market is the stuff of dealmaking dreams: easing regulations, fast-growing online platforms and more states eager to get in on the action in the name of fresh tax revenues.</p> <p>But one of the country's biggest players, <strong>MGM</strong>, is struggling to deepen its footprint.</p> <p>The US casino group remains locked in an exclusive joint venture with UK gambling group <strong>Entain </strong>after finally admitting defeat in its attempt to combine the two companies.</p> <p>The cards were stacked against MGM ahead of the £8bn bid's failure, as <strong>Barry Diller</strong>, the billionaire chairman of its largest shareholder <strong>IAC</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7fc84e9a-d3f3-404f-9e69-551f142ed8a1\">aptly predicted</a>.</p> <p>For one, MGM's offer fell significantly below Entain's expectations, sources <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5b16bc0-5b87-4c17-9d97-0d29d38eda20\">told</a> the FT's Alice Hancock and DD's Arash Massoudi, as a combination of the US sports betting boom and expectations of further industry consolidation sent the UK group's shares up sharply in recent months.</p> <p>Then there was the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bdf750d-7ba5-4353-853e-89ca998365d6\">unexpected departure</a> of Entain's chief <strong>Shay Segev</strong>, who earlier this month announced his plans to jump ship for sports streaming platform <strong>DAZN </strong>while talks were still under way.</p> <p>“His departure threw everything up,” a person close to the negotiations.</p> <p>Just weeks ago, MGM's chief <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91fb3233-295a-4c4c-8bf6-01cb5e57c73c\"><strong>Bill Hornbuckle</strong></a> was betting on sealing the deal with Entain as a way into the ring with sports betting heavyweights like <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7118df11-531f-4108-b445-7902f9044f4e\"><strong>Flutter</strong></a> and Spac poster child <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f1d5ebd-3993-4d04-9f5a-43e1bd00c4e6\"><strong>DraftKings</strong></a>.</p> <p>MGM ought to be “taken out and shot” if it didn't manage to cinch a leading position in the red hot market given “all the opportunities” it had, Diller <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91fb3233-295a-4c4c-8bf6-01cb5e57c73c\">told the FT</a> earlier this month.</p> <p>It turns out Hornbuckle may have jumped the gun. Now he has to go away for six months under UK takeover rules. But we imagine we'll be hearing about this deal again in the second half of the year.&#xa0;</p> <h2>David Solomon speaks for the Spac sceptics&#xa0;</h2> <p>When someone who worked for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/431b35ca-53fd-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1\"><strong>Michael Milken</strong></a> questions whether things have “gone too far”, it might be time to listen.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> chief executive <strong>David Solomon</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/caa33f44-fd08-4049-a20e-3c3fde778b50\">thrown cold water</a> on the blank-cheque vehicle boom, calling the pace of listings unsustainable.&#xa0;</p> <p>If anyone is keeping track, special purpose acquisition companies have raised $15bn so far this year. Though we'd like to think otherwise, we're just three weeks into January and Spacs have already raised a fifth of the $78bn the vehicles accumulated last year.</p> <p>Solomon said what a lot of people are thinking — there will be some sort of event that will bring the level of activity down.&#xa0;</p> <p>For example, a clog in the PIPEs (short for private investment in public equity) would likely bring Spac dealmaking, which relies heavily on these investments, to a standstill.&#xa0;</p> <p>The other challenge is competition for good companies. With more Spacs on the hunt, there are fewer targets, at least good ones, to take public.</p> <p>Solomon touched on this during Goldman's quarterly call with analysts. He drew a distinction between companies that go public through Spacs by choice and those that don't have other alternatives.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Those are things that the market will have to wrestle with,” he said.&#xa0;</p> <p>Solomon's concerns about the Spacs haven't kept Goldman out of the game. It advised on 30 blank cheque initial public offerings last year that raised $7.7bn and the bank has two Spacs of its own.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Simon Wolfson</strong>, the chief executive of fashion chain <strong>Next</strong>, joined the board of<strong> Deliveroo</strong> as a non-executive director as the food delivery app gears up for an expected IPO. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/025f1ab2-5134-481d-8e95-3763b3b9aee8\">More here</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Fraud investigator <strong>Martin Stapleton</strong> has departed UK hedge fund <strong>Gladstone</strong>, where he was one of six partners at the group.
