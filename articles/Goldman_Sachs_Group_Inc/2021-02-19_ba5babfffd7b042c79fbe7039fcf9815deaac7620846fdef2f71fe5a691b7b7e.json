  "title": "Banking & Finance: Apollo Appoints Lead Director",
  "text": "<p>At Apollo, Mr. Clayton, who is well regarded on Wall Street, will join a firm that is in transition following revelations of ties between Chief Executive Leon Black and the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. An independent review by the law firm Dechert LLP revealed that Mr. Black paid Epstein a total of $158 million for tax- and estate-planning services, far more than was previously known.</p><p>It found no evidence that Mr. Black was involved in the criminal activities of Epstein, who was indicted in 2019 on federal sex-trafficking charges involving underage girls and later killed himself in jail.</p><p>Mr. Black last month said he would step down as Apollo CEO by the time he turns 70 in July, ceding the role to co-founder Marc Rowan. Mr. Black, who will remain chairman, recommended that the board appoint more independent directors and move to eliminate Apollo's dual-class share structure.</p><p>\"All of us are moving from the small private partnerships that we started life as to important components of a more global financial system,\" Mr. Rowan said on a Feb. 3 conference call to discuss Apollo's fourth-quarter results. \"Proper governance and transparency are going to be essential to play the role that we are supposed to play in this marketplace.\"</p><p>The New York firm previously said it had appointed Pamela Joyner, founder of the marketing firm Avid Partners LLC, and Siddhartha Mukherjee, a scientist, oncologist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author, as independent directors and told investors it planned to add at least two more.</p><p>Mr. Clayton said he looks forward to serving public investors in the role, adding that he supports Apollo's transition to \"a more shareholder-oriented governance model.\"</p><p>\"Over the last two decades Apollo has been at the forefront of the allocation of capital,\" he said. \"Our markets are going to change, and they want to be part of that.\" He is slated to assume his role at the firm on March 1.</p><p>Mr. Clayton, a longtime corporate deals lawyer who served on Sullivan &amp; Cromwell's management committee, was nominated for the SEC role by then-President Donald Trump in 2017. He pursued an active enforcement agenda, taking action against Tesla Inc. and Theranos Inc., and increased restrictions on brokers who sell products to individual investors. He also focused on making it easier for companies to raise capital, including in private markets.</p><p>President Biden last month nominated Gary Gensler, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who ran the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the Obama administration, to replace Mr. Clayton as SEC chairman.</p>",
