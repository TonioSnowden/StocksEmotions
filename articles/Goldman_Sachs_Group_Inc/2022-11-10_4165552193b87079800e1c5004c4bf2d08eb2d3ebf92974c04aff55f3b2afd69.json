  "title": "Paytm's Earnings Report Delivers a Little Hope",
  "text": "<p>A sustainable rebound for shares of Paytm, which raised about $2.5 billion in India's largest initial public offering last November, awaits good news on the regulatory front -- and probably a global sea change in investor sentiment toward tech firms, too. For now, both prospects still look remote.</p><p>Shares of the Indian digital-payments company, which counts SoftBank's Vision Fund, Jack Ma's Ant Group and Berkshire Hathaway as backers, are down 67% from their 52-week high. Its disastrous debut last year became a symbol of inflated valuations in the Indian startup ecosystem and led to tighter regulatory oversight of public listings.</p><p>Nonetheless, those results were relatively encouraging. The company, formally known as One97 Communications Ltd., said revenue surged 76% to 19.14 billion Indian rupees, equivalent to $235.34 million, in the September quarter, even as its consolidated net loss widened to 5.71 billion rupees on higher payment-processing charges and employee benefits.</p><p>Adjusted loss before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, came in at 1.66 billion rupees, compared with 4.26 billion rupees in the year-earlier period. Earnings got an assist from better margins in Paytm's core payments business and strong momentum in its higher-margin loan distribution business -- i.e., connecting lenders and borrowers for a fee. Goldman Sachs sees Paytm delivering revenue growth of 40% to 50% for the next few quarters. Paytm's adjusted Ebitda margin has improved by more than 40 percentage points in the past six quarters, notes the bank.</p><p>Paytm still faces serious regulatory headwinds, which could handicap its growth. Its financial-services business is doing well, but its potential is capped with Paytm not owning a \"small finance bank license\" -- meaning it can only act as a loan distributor middleman rather than make loans itself like a bank.</p><p>And the chances of acquiring that license appear to have fallen further after India's central bank banned Paytm's payments bank from onboarding new customers due to cybersecurity risks earlier in 2022. Even after almost eight months, Paytm doesn't have a firm timeline on when Paytm Payments Bank will be allowed to onboard new customers.</p><p>For those with a healthy risk appetite -- and a long time frame for booking gains -- the current share price may be a compelling entry point into India's largest fintech platform. Its stock currently trades at about 4.5 times projected sales for the next 12 months, according to FactSet -- versus 23 times at one point in November of last year.</p><p>But it could be quite a long wait to realize gains, given how negative sentiment is on tech stocks right now and the chill winds still blowing from the U.S. Federal Reserve. For most investors, it probably makes sense to wait for better times -- and clearer signals on the future of Paytm's financial services division -- before tiptoeing in.</p>",
