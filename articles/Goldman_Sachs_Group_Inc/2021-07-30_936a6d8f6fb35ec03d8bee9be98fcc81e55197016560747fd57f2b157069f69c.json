  "text": "<p>Credit Suisse is rushing to overhaul its risk department, including rehiring on inflated salaries staff who have recently left, following the publication of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef996142-e5dd-45ae-9008-fc4cbd8c291d\">damning report</a> into the $5.5bn loss the bank suffered from the collapse of Archegos Capital.</p> <p>As part of the reshuffle Ralf Hafner, chief risk officer of the investment bank, will leave in August and be replaced by Ben Wilkinson, currently head of risk at the international wealth management division, according to people with knowledge of the move. </p> <p>This week's report by law firm Paul Weiss identified Hafner as having missed crucial opportunities to prevent the huge losses incurred from the family office's soured trades. His departure was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.</p> <p>Interim risk chief Joachim Oechslin has also made several other changes in its risk management function, rehiring or promoting several people removed or sidelined under previous CRO Lara Warner, as the bank prepares for the arrival of new risk chief <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66f59140-da4f-4d41-9800-7092e48a505b\">David Wildermuth</a> from Goldman Sachs next year.</p> <p>Valeriu Bajenaru, a five-year veteran who left at the start of the year for Santander, is returning as global head of enterprise risk management on a more lucrative contract, the people said. </p> <p>Tom Wootton, previously global head of liquidity risk management, has been named UK CRO in the reshuffle, which was another of Hafner's roles.</p> <p>Oechslin himself was pushed aside to become an adviser and chief of staff to the chief executive in 2019 after five years as chief risk officer, before being temporarily reinstalled in the wake of Archegos.</p> <p>The bank is in discussion with other former staff and expects to announce more changes soon, said one of the people familiar with the situation.</p> <p>The probe by law firm Paul Weiss was commissioned by Credit Suisse's board in response to the biggest trading loss in its 165-year history. The report accused the Swiss lender's investment bank of having a “lackadaisical attitude towards risk” and deep cultural problems.</p> <p>Separately, the asset management business, which was rocked just weeks before Archegos by another scandal involving niche finance company Greensill Capital, has created a new chief risk officer role.</p> <p>Credit Suisse Asset Management has hired Wolfram Peters, former chief risk officer at Allianz Global Advisors, to fill the position, which was created in response to the business being separated from the wealth management division. The hire was first reported by Reuters.</p> <p>CSAM was forced to liquidate $10bn of investment funds in March linked to the now insolvent Greensill.</p> <p>The Paul Weiss report criticised the practice of “juniorisation” in the risk department, as experienced executives were replaced by younger counterparts.</p> <p>The report found that significant cost-cutting in recent years had led to 40 per cent of senior risk managers leaving Credit Suisse in the two years running up to Archegos's collapse, with the majority being made redundant or fired.</p> <p>The Financial Times catalogued many of the risk management missteps in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb708ba2-ea8c-4c66-9190-0255fa5112e3\">investigation in April</a>.</p> <p>Former CRO Warner, who was removed in April, had reshaped the risk function so that it would be “more commercial” and “aligned” with front office traders and relationship managers, people involved told the FT at the time.</p> <p>The sheer number of senior departures introduced “a sense of fear” that changed the culture of risk and prevented the more inexperienced staff left from saying “no” to proposed deals, one person said.</p> <p>Other sources said Warner changed reporting lines, making previously separate risk teams subservient to front office technology managers. As a result, “risk lost its independence”, another person recalled.</p> <p>In order to prevent the same missteps from reoccurring, Credit Suisse now requires executives and the board risk committee to be notified if front-line traders ask for a risk decision to be revisited and overruled.</p> <p>“It will take time to digest this. Credit Suisse is washing all its dirty laundry to try and move on,” said one person at the bank. “Bringing back senior risk managers Lara fired is sensible [and] . . . the internal transfers look like the right moves. Jo [Oechslin] is stabilising the place before David joins.”</p><p>Source: Stephen Morris and Owen Walker in London 2021 'Credit Suisse resorts to rehiring risk staff on elevated salaries after scandals' FT.com 30 July.
