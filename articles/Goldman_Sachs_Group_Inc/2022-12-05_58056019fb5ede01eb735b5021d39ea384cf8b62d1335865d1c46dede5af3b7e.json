To apply consistency, however, writers should also apply the descriptive moniker to Arab leaders who practice Holocaust denial, such as Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, whenever they meet American officials, including President Biden.</p><p>Daniel Jacobs</p><p>Orlando, Fla.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Trump fell back on his stock answer for Mr. Fuentes, but it's irrelevant. He knows Mr. West very well and certainly knows about his deranged and anti-Semitic theories, aired publicly for the past two months.</p><p>Steven Morris</p><p>Mt. Pleasant, S.C.</p><p>---</p><p>Your editorial \"Donald Trump's Bad Dinner Guests\" (Nov. 28) is critical of Mr. Trump for not admitting his mistake in hosting two racists and anti-Semites for dinner at Mar-a-Lago. However, the one constant in the universe, the immutable law of nature, is that Mr. Trump doesn't admit mistakes.</p><p>William Goldman</p><p>Los Angeles</p><p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Trump Is No Anti-Semite: Judge the Man by His Acts\" -- WSJ Dec. 8, 2022)</p>",
