If it's peppered with ‘I' and ‘my' he/she has forgotten how to be a team player (if they ever knew).”</p> <p><strong>In further reading</strong>&#xa0;and listening this week, Guoli Chen, strategy professor at Insead, tackles the age-old question of whether chief executives actually matter, in&#xa0;<a href=\"https://knowledge.insead.edu/strategy/do-ceos-matter-16456\">a podcast for Insead Knowledge</a>. “CEOs and leaders are important, but maybe not as much as we thought”, he says, because of our obsession with individuals and “the romance of leadership”.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Moules' business school news</strong></p> <p>Executive education teams at business schools have had a difficult pandemic, but prospects for this vital area of revenue for many institutions emerging from the pandemic appear better,&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/751da438-9bf9-4a31-a43d-714bd1499743?emailId=60986c4d5b368000043e7813&amp;segmentId=f5ff1a1a-1590-1863-3861-e9c91a6a3b7f\">according to FT research</a>.
