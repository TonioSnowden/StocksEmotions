  "text": "<p>Under the prepackaged plan, creditors owed $210 million would receive $100 million of new debt and a mix of preferred and common stock in the reorganized company. Goldman is providing a $6 million bankruptcy loan to fund the chapter 11 case, according to plan documents distributed to creditors ahead of Monday's chapter 11 filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston.</p><p>GC Services opened for business in 1957 and was acquired by affiliates of private-equity firm Owner Resource Group LLC in 2015, documents show.</p><p>Despite being \"operationally sound,\" the company said it filed for bankruptcy to deal with its high degree of indebtedness, roughly 14.5 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for its 2020 fiscal year.</p><p>The company's \"precarious financial position\" has hurt its ability to retain customers and make the technology upgrades needed to comply with state and licensing requirements, the plan documents say. The company projects that its adjusted Ebitda will decline in fiscal 2021 to approximately $9.5 million.</p><p>Besides ORG GC Midco, no other entity in the corporate family expects to enter chapter 11, according to court documents. GC Services, the operating entity, is also excluded.</p><p>In mid-October, the company entered into a restructuring agreement with its major creditors and obtained the support of all its term lenders for its prepackaged plan, documents show.</p><p>GC Services works with a mix of private and government clients. The firm has faced scrutiny in the past for illegal debt-collection practices, settling with the Federal Trade Commission in 2017 for $700,000 over allegedly unlawful tactics to collect on federal student loans and other debts. GC Services didn't admit to wrongdoing.</p><p>The company has retained Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP as legal counsel and Conway MacKenzie Inc. for operational advice. Judge Marvin Isgur has been assigned to the case, numbered 21-90015.</p><p>Write to Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com</p>",
