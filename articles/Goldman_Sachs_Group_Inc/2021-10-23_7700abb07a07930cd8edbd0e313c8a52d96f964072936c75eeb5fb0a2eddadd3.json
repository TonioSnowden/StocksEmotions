  "text": "<p>A week ago, I was at <strong>Ascot Racecourse</strong>, just outside London, for <strong>British Champions Day</strong>, otherwise known as the richest race day in the UK horseracing calendar. With a prize fund of £4m and <strong>Queen Elizabeth II</strong> in attendance, it was a reminder that sport is back with all its money and spectacle. </p> <p>Her Majesty, who has been recovering this week after a night in hospital, was not typical of the day's demographic. This was a young crowd who embraced the formal dress code (I wore my best tie), bought plenty of drinks and stayed for the after-party. </p> <p>It was the length of the queues at the betting stalls that stood out most. Racing types fear what might happen if the British government's ongoing review of gambling laws results in a harsh crackdown. UK racing receives £350m a year in levy taxes, television rights and sponsorship from bookmakers. Betting sponsorship is rife in other sports. After the party, may come the hangover.</p> <p>We'll be watching developments on gambling laws, but first, we start this week's Scoreboard with a dispatch on the ongoing furore around Newcastle United's takeover and suggest financial regulations of our own. Do read on — <em>Samuel Agini, sports business reporter</em></p> <h1>How to prevent ‘financial doping' by state-funded football clubs</h1> <p>The fallout from the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed0d401a-ff9b-4199-9f5f-7a2a3e5727ca\">Saudi Arabia-led acquisition</a> of <strong>Newcastle United</strong> continues.</p> <p>The English <strong>Premier League</strong>'s 20 clubs held an emergency meeting on Monday and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae55de7f-2076-46db-9b04-204370aa0266\">agreed a temporary ban</a> on teams striking commercial deals involving “related parties”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The rule means Newcastle will not be allowed to immediately sign up a ton of Saudi companies as sponsors to funnel cash into the club, and therefore, ramp up spending on players.</p> <p>Eighteen clubs voted in favour of the proposal. Newcastle voted against. <strong>Manchester City</strong>, owned by <strong>Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan</strong>, a billionaire member of Abu Dhabi's ruling family, abstained. The Premier League champions have benefited from sponsorship deals with entities based in the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>Newcastle United fans are already engaged in mental gymnastics and moral whataboutery to welcome their new owners — <em>appalled by Jamal Khassogi's murder by Saudi agents, are you? Why do you use the Saudi-backed Uber ride-hailing service? — </em>now, they also cry hypocrisy over this week's vote.</p> <p>After all, sponsorships linked to owners are common. <strong>Leicester City</strong>'s stadium is sponsored by <strong>King Power</strong>, the Thai company run by the club's owner <strong>Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha</strong>. <strong>Everton</strong>'s owner, <strong>Farhad Moshiri</strong>, is also chair of <strong>USM</strong>, the Russian conglomerate that sponsors its training ground and has a naming rights deal over the club's new stadium.</p> <p>What's different is that Newcastle's majority owner is the <strong>Public Investment Fund</strong>, Saudi Arabia's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d93463e6-a6e0-400a-bec0-25d7c420b9f1\">$450bn sovereign wealth fund</a>, with access to more money than all other Premier League club owners combined. </p> <p>One measure Premier League rivals are seeking to introduce is to have an independent agency judge whether commercial deals are “fair value” i.e. not allowing Saudi companies to sign sponsorship agreements with Newcastle worth way more then they would be on the open market.</p> <p>Fair value is crucial to how European football's governing body <strong>Uefa</strong> assessed so-called Financial Fair Play rules designed to force clubs to live within their means.</p> <p>When state-backed clubs like Manchester City and <strong>Paris Saint-Germain</strong> were deemed to have breached FFP in recent years, they successfully launched <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97560471-ba02-482f-8a50-bb395d0f933d\">legal rearguards</a> to avoid sanctions. </p> <p><strong>Javier Tebas</strong>, president of Spain's <strong>La Liga</strong>, has accused City and PSG of “financial doping” by allegedly using state-linked companies to fund their teams. &#xa0;</p> <p>Given this history, an assessment of fair value may not prove enough to rein in Newcastle. </p> <p>Speaking at the <strong>FT Business of Sport US summit</strong> last week, <strong>Andrea Radrizzani</strong>, chair of <strong>Leeds United</strong>, said the Premier League should follow Tebas' lead at La Liga by introducing “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b37591b0-4e34-4060-a8f0-cb8f47e22347\">economic controls</a>”. The Spanish league's analysts set spending limits on each team before every season, based on factors such as turnover and debt.</p> <p>Those controls are rigidly enforced, effectively forcing debt-ridden <strong>FC Barcelona</strong> to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f731403f-6bda-43de-a963-e982efbde5de\">release star player</a> <strong>Lionel Messi</strong> this summer. </p> <p>The Premier League's global appeal, with £9bn in international broadcasting rights, comes from being a relatively unpredictable and competitive contest. Newcastle threatens that balance. Proper spending controls is the only way to level the playing field.</p> <h1>Uefa relief fund solves football's borrowing problem</h1> <p><strong>Uefa</strong> is trying to solve European football's finance problem with a €7bn pandemic relief fund. </p> <p>Last Monday, US bank <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, Australian lender <strong>Macquarie</strong> and private equity firm <strong>Apollo</strong> were among those <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5b0c52e-5d9b-42af-8286-6cae4de20769\">racing to submit</a> proposals to participate in the scheme ahead of a midnight deadline.</p> <p>The fund proves that big finance and football are growing ever more comfortable with one another. And leagues are accepting that negotiating<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebe8923b-0c29-4d1e-8cff-677d46c76817\"> as a collective</a> is cheaper than taking on debt as a single club.</p> <p>Many clubs seek <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40b1be0b-1503-4cfb-97e6-0fdd1abcfc29\">“factoring” deals</a>, borrowing against their future income to secure cash up front. But such deals are too risky for many banks. </p> <p>Historic losses, built up in the pre-pandemic years of rising player wages and transfer fees to buy the best, scared off most lenders and left many clubs ineligible for government-backed emergency loans when the crisis struck.</p> <p>The situation is even worse after a coronavirus-induced €9bn revenue shortfall over the last two seasons. It's not unheard of for teams to pay interest rates of 9 per cent on their debt, a steep price to pay in an era of ultra-low borrowing costs.</p> <p>One person with knowledge of the talks estimated that Uefa could obtain an interest rate of just 2 per cent for clubs, with a new fund administered by one bank or more set to extend finance to individual teams. </p> <p>Uefa's club competitions, namely the elite <strong>Champions League</strong>, which generated revenues of €2.7bn in the 2019-20 season, mostly from broadcast deals, give lenders the security they need to provide debt. </p> <p>The ability for competitions, rather than clubs, to source cheaper finance is why <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23641e6c-9a41-47e5-858e-b52b5ea74738\">some Premier League clubs</a> also want English football's top tier to create a fund of its own too.</p> <p>There are still unknowns. Firstly, some bankers worried about the impact on the value of Uefa's media rights in the event that the biggest clubs break away to form the controversial <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1af5993-21ed-4b92-9679-27f71482f76d\"><strong>European Super League</strong></a>.</p> <p>Secondly, people close to the banks say Uefa still hasn't told them how many clubs across Europe will be eligible for the scheme, though indications are that the governing body wants to open the fund to as many teams as possible across its three main competitions.</p> <p>The details will come later. Meanwhile, cheaper finance for Europe's Covid-damaged clubs is on the way.</p> <h1>Highlights</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>National Basketball Association</strong>'s woes in China resurfaced after <strong>Boston Celtics </strong>player <strong>Enes Kanter </strong>took to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KanterNBA/videos/839940073334520/\">social media</a> to criticise President <strong>Xi Jinping </strong>and his government's treatment of Tibet, with the New York Times reporting that the team's games <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/sports/basketball/celtics-kanter-china-tibet.html\">were pulled</a> from the Chinese internet.
