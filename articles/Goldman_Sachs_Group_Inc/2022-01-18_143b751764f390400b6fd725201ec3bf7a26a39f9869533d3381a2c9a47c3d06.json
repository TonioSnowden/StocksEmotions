  "title": "As global techs slide, e-commerce group THG gets a drubbing in London after trading update",
  "text": "<p>The FTSE 100 index UK:UKX fell 0.5% to 7,571, but fared slightly better than European bourses. However, major U.K. energy companies surged in step with crude oil prices CL00BRN00, which hit levels not seen since 2014 on geopolitical worries and after Goldman Sachs projected Brent crude BRN00 would top $100 a barrel in 2023 amid supply shortages.</p><p>Shares of Royal Dutch Shell RDS.BUK:RDSA and BP BPUK:BP rose 1.3% and 0.4%, respectively, and were among just a handful of gainers. In the telecom sector, shares of BT UK:BT.A and Vodafone VODUK:VOD were rising more than 2% each.</p><p>Concerns about the likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates were driving up bond yields and weighing on tech stocks COMP in particular on Tuesday as a rise in rates makes their future cash flows less valuable now.</p><p>A top decliner in London was THG UK:THG , or The Hut Group, whose shares slid 9%. The online group said it expects margins of 7.4% to 7.7% this year, which was shy of forecasts, though it saw improvements ahead and reported record sales.</p><p>“Under normal circumstances, a business delivering the level of growth seen in THG's latest update would be applauded by the market,” said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould. “Sadly, THG has shot itself in the foot thanks to the way it has behaved as a listed company since joining the stock market. And that means only something spectacular will lift the share price,” he said. “The fact THG is guiding for revenue growth to slow in 2022 is even more reason for disgruntled investors to keep shaking their heads in disbelief.”</p><p>“Failure to deliver the level of detail about the business desired by investors, questionable corporate governance standards, and comments by chief executive Matt Molding that he wished he'd never floated THG all amount to bad practice as far as investors are concerned, and they've voted with their feet which has left the share price languishing well below its IPO price,” added Mould.</p><p>Roland French and Cathal Kenny, analysts at Davy Group, said they were cutting their adjusted earnings outlook for full year 2021 and 2022, saying supply chain worries will continue to weigh on the company's margins. Shares of THG have slid from a September 2020 IPO price of 500 pence to 167 pence.</p><p>Elsewhere, shares of Hotel Chocolat UK:HOTC were a bright spot after the chocolate maker posted a 40% rise in first half of fiscal 2022 revenue compared with the prior year, and sees a slightly stronger performance ahead.</p><p>“The company has taken Thorntons' place as the destination of choice for premium but still affordable chocolate-based treats. Continuing international expansion and an ongoing push into wholesale markets represent growth levers for the future,” said Mould. “Its ‘gentle farming' initiative to support cacao farmers shows it is aware of ESG considerations too.”</p>",
