That's the largest one-day gain in the 30-year rate since Nov. 9.</p><p>What drove markets</p><p>Six-month through 30-year Treasury yields moved higher in reaction to a presentation by St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, which suggested that the Fed's main policy rate target may need to get to around 5% to 7%. While Bullard didn't explicitly say in his speech how high the rate needs to go, the policy maker did say the rate would have to be increased further to reach a \"sufficiently restrictive level.\" Read: This is the chart that is rattling U.S. financial markets Thursday</p><p>Some traders took Bullard's estimates with a grain of salt, considering his reputation as something of an outlier on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. However, hours after Bullard's presentation, his colleague Neel Kashkariof the Minneapolis Fed said that the central bank needs to keep raising rates until it is sure inflation has hit a ceiling. On Thursday, markets were pricing in an 81% probability that the Fed will raise borrowing costs by another 50 basis points, to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% on Dec. 14, and a 19% chance of a 75-basis-point hike next month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Traders also moved up their expectations for how high the fed-funds rate target might go next year, to further above 5%, but they don't yet see a significant chance of a 6% policy rate.</p><p>Read: Goldman Sachs sees new rate hike in 2023, with targeted range for fed funds rising to 5%-5.25%</p><p>In U.S. economic releases, initial weekly jobless claims fell slightly to 222,000 in mid-November.
