  "title": "Yellen Meets China's Central Bank Governor as U.S. Seeks to Repair Ties With Beijing; The Treasury secretary says she is trying to prevent an economic conflict with the world's second-largest economy from escalating further",
  "text": "<p>Ms. Yellen met with People's Bank of China Gov. Yi Gang for more than two hours on Wednesday on the sidelines of a summit of the Group of 20 major economies in Bali, Indonesia. They discussed the volatility in energy and commodity markets and the economic outlook for the two countries, according to a U.S. readout of the meeting. The People's Bank of China called the exchange broad and constructive, but didn't offer any further details.</p><p>The meeting comes after the Biden administration imposed export restrictions last month on advanced semiconductors to prevent the technology from advancing Chinese military power. Economists at Goldman Sachs said in a report last week that they estimate the U.S. ban will shave around a quarter of a percentage point off China's economic growth in 2023.</p><p>Ms. Yellen has also called for U.S. companies to shift their supply chains out of China and into countries more closely allied with the U.S., including during a recent trip to India, in a push she calls \"friend-shoring.\" She has said she is seeking to make the case to her Chinese counterparts that the semiconductor ban and the push for more-resilient supply chains is based on U.S. national securityâ€”not an effort to damp Chinese economic potential.</p><p>\"We should be listening if they're concerned about actions we've taken, did they have some repercussions that were unintended?\" Ms. Yellen, who also participated in President Biden's meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week, said on Sunday.</p><p>Ms. Yellen is concerned about the possibility of the U.S. and China taking a more confrontational approach that spirals into tit-for-tat retaliations, according to people familiar with the matter. She sees a conflict as potentially costly because of the U.S. reliance on China for critical goods like rare earths, the officials said. Rare earths are used to make components for a range of products, from electric vehicles to smartphone screens and missile-defense systems.</p><p>Ms. Yellen has favored lifting some Trump-era tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. because they raise consumer prices in the U.S., though Mr. Biden has kept the tariffs in place and isn't expected to adjust them in the near future.</p><p>She has also repeatedly called for China to take a more relaxed approach as a major creditor to low-income countries and extend relief more readily to debt-distressed countries. A strengthening dollar this year has raised concerns that many low-income countries could face debt crises.</p><p>Ms. Yellen and her team aren't yet sure who will lead China's economic diplomacy after the recent Communist Party congress put into place a new lineup of leadership. Mr. Yi, whom Ms. Yellen met Wednesday, is expected to step down from his post early next year.</p><p>Write to Andrew Duehren at andrew.duehren@wsj.com</p><p>Yellen Meets China's Central Bank Governor as U.S. Seeks to Repair Ties With Beijing</p>",
