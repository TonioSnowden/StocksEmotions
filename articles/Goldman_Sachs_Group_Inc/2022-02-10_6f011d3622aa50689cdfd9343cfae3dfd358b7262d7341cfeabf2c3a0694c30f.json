  "title": "No More Insider Trading in Congress; The current penalties are so small that lawmakers hardly take them seriously.",
  "text": "<p>Ms. Pelosi is right. We live in a time of investor websites that track the trades of public officials, with the idea that they reveal information about promising investments. What these websites realize is that Congress has enormous influence on corporate stock prices, whether by potentially regulating Big Tech, subsidizing electric vehicles, or changing copyright law.</p><p>Scrutiny of congressional stock trades is not new. Peter Schweizer's 2011 book, \"Throw Them All Out,\" shined a spotlight on congressmen who traded on insider knowledge. Six members of Congress sold hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stocks (which for congressmen could be most of their net worth) right before the financial markets crashed in 2008. The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012 improved disclosure of trades and prohibited use of \"any nonpublic information derived from the individual's position or gained from performance of the individual's duties, for personal benefit.\"</p><p>The Stock Act, however, had no teeth, partly because intent and benefit are hard to prove. Complex legislation and its effects on companies can be difficult to understand and to police. There are thousands of possible stocks to trade, most of which can be affected by federal legislation. With more than 500 legislators, there are too many permutations to police.</p><p>Insider trading based on private company information (acting on reports of earnings before they're released, for example) is much easier for authorities to detect compared to congressional knowledge. Members of Congress on average tend to be wealthy and have large portfolios with many different stocks, further complicating enforcement. On Feb. 3 Insider published a catalog of 55 Stock Act violations by sitting members of Congress. The penalties for such violations are so small (usually around $200 a violation, which can also be waived by House or Senate ethics officials) that Congress hardly takes them seriously. So shady trading by public officials continues.</p><p>The issue has returned to the public eye only because of recent scandals. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan and Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida all recently resigned after revealations of stock trades. After these scandals, the Fed banned officials from trading individual stocks.</p><p>Congress should do the same. During my time at Goldman Sachs, essentially all employees were banned or heavily discouraged from trading single-name stocks in personal accounts. Over the past decade, this has slowly become the norm at Wall Street banks.</p><p>This wouldn't be so bad for public officials either. Exchange-traded and index funds offer some of the best returns, and perhaps the best investment strategy, available to most people.</p><p>The best and safest alternative we have to protect market integrity is to ban single-name stock trading altogether by public officials.</p><p>Mr. Hartley is a doctoral student in economics at Stanford and a research fellow at the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity.</p><p>No More Insider Trading in Congress</p>",
