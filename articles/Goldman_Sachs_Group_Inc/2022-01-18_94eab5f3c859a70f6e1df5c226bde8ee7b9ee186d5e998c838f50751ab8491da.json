  "title": "New York Developer All Year Strikes Bankruptcy Deal With Investor; Proposed settlement involves selling eight Brooklyn properties to repay investor Gary Katz",
  "text": "<p>All Year has said it owes Mr. Katz about $57 million. As repayment, the company has offered to transfer a corporate affiliate, All Year Equity Partners, to Mr. Katz, who could then sell its eight apartment buildings within five years.</p><p>Mr. Katz would get the bulk of the proceeds. All Year could receive about $5 million down the line, according to court papers.</p><p>Judge Martin Glenn of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York is expected to hold a hearing on the settlement proposal in late January.</p><p>All Year, owned by developer Yoel Goldman, filed for chapter 11 last month to protect itself from potential litigation in the U.S. and Israel while continuing negotiations with creditors owed nearly $1.6 billion in debt, made up of about $800 million in bonds issued on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and $760 million in mortgage loans.</p><p>Negotiations with Mr. Katz began a few months before the bankruptcy filing and the settlement terms are backed by the Israeli bondholders, according to court papers.</p><p>Mr. Goldman was provided with the settlement and hasn't objected to its terms, court papers say. He is the company's sole owner but has relinquished his control to outside professionals. Lawyers representing Mr. Goldman didn't return requests for comment.</p><p>Founded by Mr. Goldman in 2014, All Year rapidly expanded its real-estate footprint, amassing a portfolio of about 120 properties, which include about 1,650 residential and 70 commercial units in Brooklyn. The company struggled to meet its debt obligations during the Covid-19 pandemic, and last year All Year and its investors began discussing a possible restructuring of the company.</p><p>In February, All Year placed into bankruptcy its 900-unit Denizen luxury apartment complex in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bushwick, citing a decline in rental income during the pandemic. In September, All Year sold the complex for $506 million.</p><p>Write to Akiko Matsuda at akiko.matsuda@wsj.com</p>",
