  "text": "<p>   'Get in the boats and go.\" As the coronavirus pandemic upended global commerce in March 2020, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell repeatedly invoked the urgent British evacuations from Dunkirk in World War II. </p><p>   This wasn't the time, he said, to get hung up on the technicalities that central bank economists and lawyers love to chew over. Mr. Powell bluntly directed his colleagues to move as fast as possible. They devised unparalleled emergency-lending backstops to stem an incipient financial panic that threatened to exacerbate the unfolding economic and public-health emergencies. </p><p>   Over the week of March 16, markets experienced an enormous shock to what investors refer to as liquidity, a catchall term for the cost of quickly converting an asset into cash. </p><p>   The Fed had tried to get ahead of liquidity problems that Sunday, March 15, when Mr. Powell led his colleagues to slash interest rates to zero at a second emergency meeting in as many weeks. They were offering nearly unlimited cheap debt to keep the wheels of finance turning, and when that didn't help, the Fed began purchasing massive quantities of government debt outright. </p><p>   The next morning, at 6:56 a.m., Mr. Powell dashed off an email to one of his top lieutenants, Vice Chairman Richard Clarida: \"Focus turns 100% now to liquidity, where we may have a lot to do!\" </p><p>   But none of the Fed's actions were having their intended effect. Investors dumped whatever they could, including ostensibly \"risk-free\" U.S. Treasury securities. As a global dash for dollars unfolded, Treasurys were no longer serving as the market's traditional shock absorbers, amplifying extreme turmoil on Wall Street. </p><p>   \"Hell is coming,\" said billionaire investor Bill Ackman, calling into CNBC at midday on March 18 during an emotional, 28-minute live interview. He called for a 30-day shutdown of the economy. \"We need to shut it down. Shut it down now,\" he said. </p><p>   The Dow tumbled as Mr. Ackman spoke, dropping as much as 2,000 points and triggering a marketwide 15-minute trading halt shortly before 1 p.m., one of several that month. By week's end, the Dow had plunged more than 10,000 points since mid-February as investors struggled to get their arms around what a halt to global commerce would mean for businesses that would soon have no revenue. </p><p>   Daleep Singh, the markets desk chief at the New York Fed, was inundated with messages from contacts urging a shutdown to trading. </p><p>   \"It was sheer, unadulterated panic, of a magnitude that was far worse than in 2008 and 2009. Far worse,\" said Mr. Singh, who had spent the 2008 crisis on the interest-rate desk at the Goldman Sachs trading floor in London. The idea of shutting down markets was especially discouraging: \"It was a profoundly un-American thing to contemplate, to just shut everything down, and almost fatalistic -- that we're not going to get out of this.\" </p><p>   Working from a home office that overlooks the 10th hole of a country-club golf course outside Washington, Mr. Powell pressed colleagues to work through the weekend finalizing a raft of unprecedented backstops. The plan, circulated that Saturday in a Word document titled \"Near-term plan March 21,\" would draw the central bank into a realm where it had never gone before or wanted to go -- lending directly to U.S. businesses, cities and states. </p><p>   Today, nearly two years later, most agree that the Fed's actions helped to save the economy from going into a pandemic-induced tailspin. The question now is what will be the long-term costs and implications of that emergency activism -- for the Fed, the financial markets and the wider economy. </p><p>   \"My thought was -- I remember this very clearly -- 'O.K. We have a four-or-five-day chance to really get our act together and get ahead of this. We're gonna try to get ahead of this,'\" Mr. Powell recalled later. \"And we were going to do that by just announcing a ton of stuff on Monday morning.\" </p><p>   It worked. The Fed's pledges to backstop an array of lending, announced on Monday, March 23, would unleash a torrent of private borrowing based on the mere promise of central bank action -- together with a massive assist by Congress, which authorized hundreds of billions of dollars that would cover any losses. </p><p>   No company illustrated the speed with which the Fed's announcement had buoyed investors better than Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise-line operator. Its business had collapsed as Covid halted cruises world-wide. Within days of the Fed's announcement, Carnival was able to borrow nearly $6 billion from large institutional investors. </p><p>   News of the financial salvation ricocheted through the (virtual) corner offices of American corporations, across (virtual) trading floors on Wall Street and even along the actual corridors of the West Wing. If the hardest-hit companies like Carnival, with its fleet of 104 ships docked indefinitely, could raise money in capital markets, who couldn't? </p><p>   Mr. Powell unveiled his philosophy during a webinar on April 9, where he shed an earlier reluctance to express an opinion about government spending policies, which are set by elected officials and not the Fed. He spoke in unusually moral terms. \"All of us are affected,\" he said. \"But the burdens are falling most heavily on those least able to carry them. . . . They didn't cause this. Their business isn't closed because of anything they did wrong. This is what the great fiscal power of the United States is for -- to protect these people as best we can from the hardships they are facing.\" </p><p>   They were extraordinary words from a Fed chair who during earlier, hot-button policy debates said the central bank needed to \"stay in its lane\" and avoid providing specific advice. </p><p>   Earlier that day, the Fed had announced its most novel lending programs yet, which were made possible after Congress included more than $450 billion as capital to cover losses on Fed loans to businesses, cities and states. </p><p>   To avoid a widening rift between the market haves (who had been given access to Fed backstops) and the market have-nots (who had been left out because their debt was deemed too risky), Mr. Powell had supported a decision to extend the Fed's lending to include companies that were being downgraded to \"junk\" status in the days after it agreed to backstop their bonds. </p><p>   Most controversially, Mr. Powell recommended that the Fed purchase investment vehicles known as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that invest in junk debt. He and his colleagues feared that these \"high-yield\" bonds might buckle, creating a wave of bankruptcies that would cause long-term scarring in the economy. Given the speed with which markets had cracked up in March, Mr. Powell decided that it was better to err on the side of doing too much than not doing enough. </p><p>   In a letter circulated to investors, Paul Singer, who runs the hedge-fund firm Elliott Management, warned that the Fed was sowing the seeds of a bigger crisis by absolving markets of any discipline. \"Sadly, when people (including those who should know better) do something stupid and reckless and are not punished,\" he wrote, \"it is human nature that, far from thinking that they were lucky to have gotten away with something, they are encouraged to keep doing the stupid thing.\" </p><p>   Reservations about Mr. Powell's make-people-whole mantra weren't limited to the free-market libertarian set. The breathtaking speed with which the Fed moved and with which Wall Street rallied after the Fed's announcements infuriated Dennis Kelleher, a former corporate lawyer and high-ranking Senate aide who runs Better Markets, an advocacy group lobbying for tighter financial regulations. </p><p>   \"Literally, not only has no one in finance lost money, but they've all made more money than they could have dreamed,\" said Mr. Kelleher. \"It just can't be the case that the only thing the Fed can do is open the fire hydrants wide for everybody. This is a ridiculous discussion no matter how heartfelt Powell is about 'we can't pick winners and losers' -- to which my answer is, 'So instead you just make them all winners?'\" </p><p>   Mr. Powell later defended his decision to purchase ETFs that had invested in junk debt. \"We wanted to find a surgical way to get in and support that market because it's a huge market, and it's a lot of people's jobs . . . What were we supposed to do? Just let them die and lose all those jobs?\" he said. \"If that's the biggest mistake we made, stipulating it as a mistake, I'm fine with that. It wasn't time to be making finely crafted judgments,\" Mr. Powell said. He hesitated for a moment before concluding. \"Do I regret it? I don't -- not really.\" </p><p>   Mr. Powell and his colleagues waged war against the pandemic shock with their eyes focused on the lessons of the 2008 financial crisis. He later conceded that during the darkest weeks of the crisis, the Fed talked about a \"mini-Depression scenario,\" one in which the virus kept society closed indefinitely. </p><p>   \"We didn't know there was a vaccine coming. The pandemic is just raging. And we don't have a plan,\" said Mr. Powell. \"Nobody in the world has a plan. And in hindsight, the worry was, 'What if we can't really fully open the economy for a long time because the pandemic is just out there killing people?'\" </p><p>   Mr. Powell never saw this as a particularly likely outcome, \"but it was around the edges of the conversation, and we were very eager to do everything we could to avoid that outcome,\" he said later. </p><p>   The Fed's initial response in 2020 received mostly high marks -- a notable contrast with the populist ire that greeted Wall Street bailouts following the 2008 financial crisis. North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, the top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, gave Mr. Powell an \"A-plus for 2020,\" he said. \"On a one-to-10 scale? It was an 11. He gets the highest, highest marks, and deserves them. The Fed as an institution deserves them.\" </p><p></p>",
