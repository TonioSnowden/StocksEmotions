  "title": "Gates-Backed Startup to Buy Stake in Zambia Copper Deposit in $150 Million Deal; The transaction coincides with Biden's summit with African leaders, as competition for critical minerals intensifies",
  "text": "<p>Under the deal, Berkeley, Calif.-based KoBold will pay the owners of the Lubambe Copper Mine—which is 80% held by private-equity firm EMR Capital—$115 million to spend on the existing mining operations in exchange for a majority stake in the nearby Mingomba deposit, formerly known as the Lubambe Extension Project.</p><p>It will also commit to spending $35 million on exploration at Mingomba, in which EMR Capital and its joint venture partner, government-backed ZCCM Investments Holdings PLC, will hold minority interests.</p><p>The deal \"sends a powerful signal that the U.S. and its allies can and will compete successfully for the minerals and resources that will power the global clean energy transition,\" said Michael Gonzales, the U.S. ambassador to Zambia.</p><p>The Mingomba deposit is located in Zambia's Chililabombwe district in the metals-rich Central African Copperbelt that stretches across southern Congo and northern Zambia. Earlier this year, Canada's First Quantum Minerals Ltd. approved a $1.25 billion project to expand its Kansanshi copper mine in Zambia.</p><p>Mingomba will be KoBold's largest investment to date, Josh Goldman, the company's president, said in an interview.</p><p>The deposit is estimated to contain roughly 9 million metric tons of copper based on prior exploration efforts, although that work has yet to determine where the mineral resource ends, said KoBold.</p><p>\"Converted to copper contained in electric vehicles, it's like 100 million electric vehicles,\" Mr. Goldman said. Electric vehicles use roughly four times as much copper as gasoline-powered cars.</p><p>KoBold will own 52% of the Mingomba venture. EMR Capital will own 28% and ZCCM Investments Holdings will retain 20%, in line with its interest in the existing copper mine, said EMR Capital Executive Chairman Owen Hegarty.</p><p>The Lubambe Copper Mine will continue to be owned by EMR Capital and ZCCM Investments Holdings. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2023.</p><p>Mr. Hegarty of EMR said the private-equity manager—whose investors are mostly American, and which acquired its stake at Lubambe in 2017—had always intended to get another partner and spoke to several entities about joining the project.</p><p>\"But they were more interested in saying goodbye to us and we thought we'd prefer to work with somebody in a co-investment, joint-venture style, rather than kiss goodbye to everything,\" he said. \"We still end up with a significant share.\"</p><p>Development of Mingomba could cost upward of $700 million, depending on how it is staged, Mr. Hegarty said.</p><p>Zambia's government wants to increase the country's annual copper production to 3 million metric tons from roughly 850,000 tons over the coming decade, President Hakainde Hichilema said in prepared remarks for the Washington summit on Wednesday.</p><p>\"Doing that requires more mineral exploration, new ideas, and new technology,\" he said.</p><p>Global miners say most deposits close to the Earth's surface have already been discovered and the industry needs to adopt new methods, such as AI, to find commodities that are hidden deeper underground.</p><p>KoBold uses machine learning and other scientific computing methods to guide where to procure land, what data to collect and where to drill.</p><p>The company, founded in 2018, raised $192.5 million in a financing roundearlier this year that attracted investors including BHP Group Ltd., the world's largest miner by market value. Other backers of the company include venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Canada's largest pension fund.</p><p>Write to Rhiannon Hoyle at rhiannon.hoyle@wsj.com</p><p>Gates-Backed Startup to Buy Stake in Zambia Copper Deposit in $150 Million Deal</p>",
