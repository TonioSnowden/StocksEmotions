  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  China's stringent approach toward controlling Covid-19 has dealt a heavy blow to its economy. As Beijing tries to aggressively increase stimulus, its evolving measures to combat the virus would test the government's push to cut financial risks. </p><p>\n  The Chinese government rolled out a spate of stimulus initiatives in recent weeks, including tax rebates and big spending on infrastructure, aiming to revive an economy that was kneecapped by lockdowns this spring. </p><p>\n  How effective those measures are will depend on how stringent China's dynamic Covid-zero policy mix remains and on other factors such as the weather and new variants. When shops, factories and workers are in a lockdown, getting infrastructure projects started is challenging no matter how much money is spent. The country's approach to the pandemic would affect how much money for buildings and bridges is available. </p><p>\n  One possible way to cut the frequency of lockdowns is more widespread and frequent PCR testing, as has been implemented in some cities including Beijing. That could be very costly if it goes nationwide: Goldman Sachs estimated testing 70% of the population every two days would cost as much as $370 billion, or 2.2% of China's economic output last year. Doing group testing could cut the bill substantially but would still be a huge fiscal burden. </p><p>\n  Moreover, local governments will likely have to bear the costs, as officials in Beijing recently made clear. Provincial and city government finances have taken a hit as land sales -- an essential revenue source -- collapsed. Revenue from government land sales fell nearly 30% year-over-year in the first four months of 2022. The housing market remains sluggish even though many local governments rolled out supportive measures. </p><p>\n  Plunging land sales and heavy spending on Covid-19 control measures would curtail how much local governments can spend on infrastructure. Nomura estimates achieving China's 16% growth target for total fiscal spending would mean that local governments could face a six trillion yuan, equivalent to around $900 billion, funding gap this year. Out of that, the roughly 3.5 trillion yuan gap in off-budget revenue would be particularly hard to fill since land sales are usually a big contributor. </p><p>\n  This comes as Beijing has been trying to force local governments to pay down hidden debts -- such as those assumed via local government-financing vehicles -- corporate entities used to raise cash off the books. Nearly a third of Chinese provinces -- especially financially weaker ones -- made net repayments on LGFV bonds in 2021, according to S&amp;P Global. </p><p>\n  The takeaway is that part of the funding would need to come from the central government. Beijing said in March that the transfer of funds from central to local governments will be increased by 18% this year. The government also asked state-owned banks to provide 800 billion yuan in lending to support the infrastructure drive. </p><p>\n  Beijing is used to juggling different demands -- ruling a country of 1.4 billion people makes that an essential skill. But keeping the economy up and both Covid-19 cases and debt levels down may prove too much for even its formidable reflexes. </p><p></p>",
