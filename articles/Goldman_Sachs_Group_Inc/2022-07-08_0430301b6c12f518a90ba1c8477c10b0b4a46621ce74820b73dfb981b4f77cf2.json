  "text": "<p>Unregulated lenders in Mexico that specialize in loans to low-income people grew at a breakneck pace over the past decade, until accounting irregularities at three Deloitte-audited firms threw the sector's credibility into question.</p><p>The three lenders—Crédito Real SAB de CV, AlphaCredit Capital SA de CV and Grupo Finmart—have discredited some financial statements as unreliable. All retained the same auditor for years: Deloitte Mexico, the Mexico City-based unit of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd.</p><p>Investors and customers are looking for answers about exactly what exactly went wrong, and a lack of financial transparency from the lenders has cooled foreign investment into once burgeoning Latin American microfinance companies that depend on capital markets to fund their businesses.</p><p>Crédito Real plans to file for insolvency in Mexico and may potentially liquidate, according to people familiar with the matter, after investors pulled the plug in the wake of its accounting irregularities. Roughly half of the value of its loan portfolio, or around $1.1 billion, turned out to be unpaid interest, a number the company didn't break out for years until it was included in a footnote to its 2020 financial statements. The company's board resigned en masse this spring, and current management is mediating between the company's creditors and its largest shareholder, Angel Romanos Berrondo, who founded the company in the 1990s.</p><p>AlphaCredit last year wrote down the value of certain assets by about $200 million, equivalent to about half of its total loan portfolio. The lender hired a new auditor, revoked its 2018-20 financial statements as unreliable and placed a U.S. subsidiary in bankruptcy. About two years after attracting SoftBank Group Corp. as an investor, AlphaCredit is now broken up and is no longer issuing new loans.</p><p>A third payroll lender audited by Deloitte Mexico, Grupo Finmart, has also faced questions over its financial statements. In 2018, three partners at Deloitte Mexico agreed, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, to be barred from the industry for two years by a U.S. regulator and fined for their work auditing Grupo Finmart from 2013 to 2014. Grupo Finmart fell within the regulator's purview because it was owned by a U.S. company at the time of the audits. In 2016, Grupo Finmart was acquired by AlphaCredit.</p><p>\"There's a pattern in these cases that suggests there is an auditing problem,\" said Miguel Minutti-Meza, an accounting professor at the University of Miami and former senior fellow at the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the U.S. audit watchdog. \"The probability that you will find three uncorrelated audit problems in the same industry at the same accountancy office is very low.\"</p><p>Deloitte Mexico, which has the legal name Galaz Yamazaki Ruiz Urquiza SC, and parent company Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu separately said they can't comment on client-related matters.</p><p>AlphaCredit, which hasn't been originating new loans since last year and is winding down operations, didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Crédito Real said that its accounting practices related to future interest payments, which it has called capitalizing interest, were flawed and that \"an investigation has been launched to understand the extent and details of the impact of such accounting policies.\" It said that the practice has been discontinued since new management took over at the company in April.</p><p>\"We believe there were deficiencies in the corporate governance of the company, the external auditors, and the authorities and regulators. We can't explain why the external auditor during all these years couldn't find these capitalized interests and then in the 2020 audited financial statements disclosed a 'capitalized interest' of 21 billion pesos [about $1 billion], without further explanation,\" the company said.</p><p>Investors didn't have an accurate picture of either Crédito Real or AlphaCredit for years, based on their financial statements as originally filed and audited by Deloitte. Since 2016, the two lenders had borrowed billions of dollars from international bond investors who were attracted by their business model of lending to low-income government employees, such as teachers, and getting repaid through payroll deductions.</p><p>Analysts said that investors who bought the two lenders' debt, including through deals arranged by banks such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Barclays PLC, face the prospect of recovering little or nothing. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays declined to comment.</p><p>AlphaCredit investors are still looking for answers about how assets valued at half its loan portfolio turned out to be impaired and why the severity of losses wasn't made apparent before April 2021, when it parted ways with Deloitte Mexico.</p><p>Signs that something was amiss in the lender's books emerged in 2020 when AlphaCredit released its 2019 financial statement, which included a new item called the \"other recoveries portfolio.\" That portfolio represented around 15% of AlphaCredit's loan book and included credits that were between 180 days and five years past due but that the company hadn't previously classified as nonperforming.</p><p>AlphaCredit's management believed the previous omission \"of such disclosures [was] immaterial to the financial statements,\" according to the audit. Deloitte said in the audit that breaking out the scope of year-to-year losses in the loan portfolio was \"impracticable…due to the cost and administrative effort needed to manually recompile information.\"</p><p>In April 2021, AlphaCredit said it had replaced Deloitte Mexico as auditor with KPMG LLP, which had concluded that the three prior years of financial statements weren't accurate. AlphaCredit also specified it was carrying nearly $200 million worth of impaired assets and accounts receivable, separate from its loan portfolio, the majority of which would likely need to be written off. AlphaCredit didn't explain why it changed auditors. Deloitte didn't issue any statement at the time about losing AlphaCredit as a client.</p><p>People familiar with the matter believe that Alpha had been inflating the value of these assets for years, making the company appear larger than it was and helping it raise more capital from investors than it might have otherwise received. These people concluded that Deloitte didn't probe whether the line items on the balance sheet were backed by legitimate assets. </p><p>Crédito Real's headquarters in Mexico City.

KPMG said it can't comment on client-related matters.</p><p>After AlphaCredit collapsed last year, investors began to worry about Crédito Real, a much larger competitor with the same auditor, Deloitte Mexico.</p><p>Some of Crédito Real's investors had noticed last year that when the lender released audited financial statements for 2020, a footnote said that about 46% of the assets reported as payroll loans consisted of what the company called \"accrued interest,\" typically meaning interest due but unpaid.</p><p>Crédito Real and Deloitte didn't give a definition for accrued interest in the financial statements. People familiar with the matter said Crédito Real was using the term to mean all future interest payments expected from its payroll loans. Normally, lenders' loan portfolio size is measured using only principal, because borrowers can prepay loans, and lenders won't necessarily receive interest income if debts are paid back early.</p><p>This unconventional accounting method made the loan portfolio appear nearly twice as large as it really was, these people said. Before the 2020 audit, Crédito Real didn't break out that roughly half of its loan portfolio was made up of future interest payments, making investors believe there were almost twice as many payroll loans on the company's books as there actually were, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Analysts were confused by the 2020 footnote disclosure, which the company didn't explain publicly at the time.</p><p>By the time the 2020 audit came out, hedge funds had put on wagers that the company's stocks and bonds would fall. Alexis Panton, a corporate credit analyst at Stifel Financial Corp., wrote in notes to clients that the company had been potentially misreporting the size of its loan portfolio or concealing large losses.</p><p>Earlier this year, Crédito Real said it failed to persuade investors to refinance a Swiss franc-denominated bond. Bankers at Goldman Sachs tried and failed to find secured financing for the company, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>In June, Crédito Real scrapped plans to file for chapter 11 in the U.S. and is planning for a Mexican insolvency process, which could result in the business liquidating. Directors have since resigned en masse from its board while bondholders try to force the company into an involuntary bankruptcy case in New York. The lender has said it would fight the involuntary petition.</p><p>Crédito Real has said it won't continue its prior method of capitalizing unpaid interest on the principal value of its loan book. Deloitte Mexico has remained the company's auditor through this year, although it hasn't completed its 2021 audit of the business, Crédito Real said. It isn't common for audits of a given financial year to be incomplete more than halfway through the following year.</p><p>The PCAOB, which oversees accounting and audits completed at U.S.-traded companies, in 2018 placed sanctions on and fined three partners at Deloitte Mexico for their work on Grupo Finmart, which was owned by Texas-based EZCorp before being sold to AlphaCredit in 2016. In that instance, Grupo Finmart had bad loans on its books that its Deloitte accountants allegedly didn't catch in their annual audits, which the PCAOB in 2018 called a dereliction of their duties.</p><p>The three Deloitte Mexico partners who settled with the PCAOB consented to the terms and penalties of the disciplinary order, which barred them from being associated with a registered public accounting firm for at least two years.</p><p>Given the relative lack of transparency in Mexico's insolvency process compared with the U.S. bankruptcy system, analysts said they didn't know whether investors or the lenders' millions of borrowers across Latin America would get concrete answers about what went wrong at either Crédito Real or AlphaCredit.</p><p>\"We think there is a very strong chance that we will not see any financial reporting or audited financial statements for the foreseeable future,\" Mr. Panton wrote in June.</p><p>Mark Maurer contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alexander Saeedy at alexander.saeedy@wsj.com</p><p>Deloitte Was a Common Factor at Troubled Mexican Shadow Banks</p>",
