  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>the Federal Trade Commission has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba37d061-cd26-47c0-9ff9-1fe8257ee8e2\">sued to block</a> Nvidia's multibillion-dollar acquisition of Arm, saying that the deal would stifle competition. It marks the latest antitrust move by US regulators which have committed to controlling the power of big business.</p> <h2>Spain's football power brokers are at odds again</h2> <p>At the very top of Spanish football lies a deep and fractious rivalry.</p> <p>On one side are <strong>Real Madrid</strong> and <strong>Barcelona</strong>, the country's biggest and most powerful clubs. </p> <p>On the other is <strong>La Liga</strong>, which runs the top two divisions, and <strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong>, a deep-pocketed private equity behemoth that is used to getting its way. </p> <p>And the battle — in which money, power and ego mix — is very, very personal. </p> <p>La Liga and CVC seemed to have triumphed this summer when Spanish clubs voted overwhelmingly in favour of a €2bn deal to give the buyout group a stake in a new company that stands to profit from the league's broadcasting and sponsorship rights for the next 50 years. </p> <p>But <strong>Florentino Pérez</strong>, Real Madrid's president and the mastermind of the failed plan for a <strong>European Super League</strong>, does not give up easily. </p> <p>With just days to go until a final December 10 vote on the CVC deal, Real Madrid and Barcelona on Thursday dropped a bombshell: a rival offer to clubs.</p> <p>The two clubs have been working with <strong>Anas Laghrari</strong>, a banker at Spanish advisory firm <strong>Key Capital</strong>, on an alternative €2bn funding package — backed by <strong>JPMorgan </strong>and <strong>Bank of America</strong> — that doesn't involve giving up TV money to financiers. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9cfdbbb9-75e4-4374-8214-977a1ddfce68\"><strong>Pérez</strong></a> is adamant that giving up a slice of the league's TV rights is a price not worth paying. </p> <p>The pair and two other clubs had already opposed the original deal, which was designed to inject much-needed capital into pandemic-stricken Spanish clubs, and negotiated an opt-out from the CVC deal. &#xa0;</p> <p>Real Madrid had also tried to derail the plans by <a href=\"https://www.realmadrid.com/en/news/2021/08/10/official-announcement\">threatening legal action</a> against <strong>Javier Tebas</strong>, La Liga president, and <strong>Javier de Jaime Guijarro</strong>, managing partner at CVC and head of its operations in Spain and Italy.</p> <p>The Real Madrid and Barcelona <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3d2e2df-e448-438b-93c6-02fe40d48dc7\">proposal</a> centres on the creation of a special-purpose vehicle that will raise €2bn of debt at a cost of 2.5-3 per cent a year over 25 years, rather than the 50-year lifetime of the CVC deal. It will distribute the funds to clubs, which will repay the interest and amortisation costs from their own revenues.</p> <p>That compares with a deal that Tebas had agreed to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/114a8d1d-c9c4-44ca-bdbf-493c74dae310\">sign over</a> 10 per cent of the league's annual broadcasting rights to CVC in exchange for cash that would be distributed to clubs for investment. Real Madrid and Barcelona's proposal does not involve signing over a share of those rights.</p> <p>The two clubs estimate that, in a base case scenario, their proposal will cost clubs roughly €900m, essentially saving more than €12bn on the overall sum that they estimate could otherwise go to CVC.</p> <p>In response, La Liga called the alternative financing “hypothetical”, labelling it an “improvised proposal elaborated without the minimum rigour required”. The Spanish league also reiterated that the CVC deal goes beyond the need to obtain financing for clubs, pointing to the private equity firm's history of sports investment.</p> <p>The thing to watch for is whether two clubs who tried to break away and form a Super League earlier this year, are able to persuade the remainder of Spanish football to ditch Tebas and CVC. </p> <p>If nothing else, the rival offer will accomplish one thing. It will remind clubs, and the wider world, just how lucrative the current deal stands to be for CVC. </p> <h2>Leon Black's ties to Epstein get stronger</h2> <p>Faced with allegations of rape and a subsequent alleged “campaign of extortion”, <strong>Leon Black</strong> sought advice from his closest confidantes: lawyers, family members and four other people. </p> <p>One of those people was <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>, the paedophile who died by suicide in jail two years ago. </p> <p>The revelation that the <strong>Apollo </strong>co-founder discussed his situation with Epstein comes from a sworn statement by Black that was filed in New York state court this week, and which is unpacked by DD's Mark Vandevelde <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c625b5d-734b-4934-8943-d02f9f2fb2e8\">here</a>. </p> <p>The disclosure adds a new layer to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23448802-3ee8-4c3c-bb46-fc02e304f3ed\">known relationship</a> between the two men. It puts Epstein in Black's close circle of friends to who the former Apollo chief executive revealed his secret payments to a woman accusing him of rape. </p> <p>In a civil lawsuit, <strong>Guzel Ganieva</strong> has accused Black of raping her and that he then proceeded to pay her millions of dollars in hush money.</p> <p>Black has admitted to paying Ganieva $9m since 2015 when she signed a “release and confidentiality agreement” at a meeting that the billionaire secretly recorded at the Four Seasons restaurant in New York.</p> <p>A discovery request submitted by Ganieva's lawyers asked Black to supply a list of those with whom he had discussed the confidentiality agreement. In a signed response that was provided under penalty of perjury, Black named three people: a private investigator at <strong>Nardello &amp; Co</strong>, Ganieva and Epstein.</p> <p>Ganieva is seeking an unspecified sum for damages from Black.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Epstein's close associate <strong>Ghislaine Maxwell</strong> is currently on trial in New York. An accuser of the dead paedophile told a court this week that, aged 14, she was taken <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66e62edc-6125-4f59-8a04-ca975aeb3507\">to meet <strong>Donald Trump</strong></a> at his Mar-a-Lago estate. </p> <p>The woman, whose identity is being kept confidential, said Epstein took her to the golf resort in Florida to meet Trump, and that she later took part in a beauty pageant associated with the former US president. She did not accuse Trump of any wrongdoing.</p> <p>Maxwell faces more than 70 years in prison if found guilty of charges including sex trafficking. Her trial continues this week. </p> <h2>Daily Mail buyout gets a bump</h2> <p>The <strong>Daily Mail </strong>newspaper is used to chronicling the public and private lives of the most desirable celebrities.</p> <p>Now, the paper finds itself in high demand, as the <strong>Rothermere</strong> family <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2959527-f876-46e9-a22f-6d7959940760\">upped their bid</a> to take private the publisher of the UK's best-selling newspaper.</p> <p>Media titan <strong>Jonathan Harmsworth, Viscount Rothermere</strong>, the controlling shareholder of the <strong>Daily Mail and General Trust</strong>, wants to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e552f3e2-f94f-40d7-8169-bffe5e572567\">buy out the group</a>, in a step that would end DMGT's 90-year history as a public company.</p> <p>The Viscount has increased his bid by £35m, saying it's the final price on the table. The move takes the offer price to 270p a share and gives DGMT an enterprise value of £885m, excluding dividends.</p> <p>The offer also comes amid a whirlwind few weeks for <strong>Paul Dacre</strong>, former Daily Mail editor, who was prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>'s favourite to chair <strong>Ofcom</strong>, the UK's media regulator, but later <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e94b62f0-5af6-428a-8ad6-54b6a7f00688\">withdrew</a> from the contest after heavy criticism that the process was rigged.</p> <p>The Rothermere family holds about 34 per cent of DGMT and has the support of several investors who hold an additional 8 per cent. They include <strong>Berry Street Capital Management</strong>, <strong>Maven Investment Partners</strong>, <strong>Syquant Capital</strong> and <strong>TIG Advisors</strong>.</p> <p>But Lord Rothermere needs to convince the rest of the shareholders of the deal and cross the 50* per cent acceptance threshold. <strong>JO Hambro Capital Management</strong> and <strong>Majedie Asset Management</strong> had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3142e2be-d048-4de1-b164-9e85d2656083\">publicly rebuked</a> the first offer. </p> <p>The potential deal includes an equity interest in <strong>Cazoo</strong>, the New York-listed online car retailer, and a 568p a share special dividend.</p> <p>Lord Rothermere's sweetened bid values the media group at about £2.75bn, below the initial £2.9bn offer value after Cazoo's shares fell more than 20 per cent since the original offer.</p> <p>Shareholders have until mid-December to accept the deal. The Rothermeres will be hoping that Christmas comes early.</p> <p><em>*This item has been corrected to reflect that the latest offer to take DMGT private requires a lower acceptance threshold.</em> </p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Blackstone</strong>'s executive vice-chair <strong>Tony James</strong> is to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/funds/tony-james-retire-blackstone-executive-vice-chairman-2021-12-02/\">leave</a> the investment group at the end of the year after more than 20 years.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>'s chair of UK investment banking, <strong>Mark Rawlinson</strong>, is stepping down. He will step back from his full-time role but remain a senior adviser at the bank.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>KKR</strong> has hired <strong>Mukul Chawla</strong> as head of growth equity in Asia-Pacific, a new role at the company. He joins from <strong>Temasek</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Freshfields </strong>has appointed <strong>Tomoko Nakajima</strong> as head of the firm's Japan M&amp;A practice. She was previously a senior counsel in its corporate and M&amp;A practice. </p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads&#xa0;&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Compensation creation </strong>Goldman Sachs executives think they aren't being paid enough.
