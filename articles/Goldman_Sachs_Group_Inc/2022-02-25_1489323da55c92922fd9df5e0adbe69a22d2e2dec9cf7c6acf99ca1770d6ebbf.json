  "title": "South Korea Wants to Graduate From Emerging Markets; If it succeeds, it could become the first country to secure developed-market status from MSCI since Israel was elevated in 2010",
  "text": "<p>The issue is such a sore point in South Korea that it is a topic ahead of next month's presidential elections. Lee Jae-myung, the candidate for the ruling left-leaning Democratic Party, has touted inclusion as a way to narrow the \"Korea discount,\" in which stocks in Seoul typically trade at lower valuations than those on other exchanges.</p><p>Any upgrade, however, rests chiefly on technical grounds related to what MSCI calls market accessibility. It also requires South Korean authorities, scarred by a free fall in the country's currency during the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, to abandon some of their caution about unfettered foreign-exchange trading.</p><p>If it succeeds, South Korea could become the first country to secure developed-market status from MSCI since Israel was elevated in 2010. Some of its stocks would join the widely followed, 23-market MSCI World Index.</p><p>Goldman Sachs analysts estimate an upgrade could trigger more than $44 billion in foreign inflows, and help reinvigorate the benchmark Kospi Composite index, which as of Friday had dropped 19% from a record closing high reached last July. Inclusion could help drive the Kospi to 4500 in two years' time, they argue, or an increase of roughly 68% from Friday's close at 2676.76.</p><p>Actual inclusion is likely in 2024 at the earliest. South Korea would first need to be added to a watch list, following an index review by MSCI that concludes later this year. Any upgrade could be confirmed in 2023, after a consultation with investors, and there would then likely be a further delay to give investors time to prepare for the change.</p><p>South Korea was first added to the watch list in 2008, but removed in 2014. The rival index provider FTSE Group, now known as FTSE Russell, upgraded South Korea in 2009.</p><p>Investors and analysts say South Korea has a better shot than before, particularly since it has shown more willingness to open up the currency market, which has been tightly controlled since the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis.</p><p>Only banks and brokers in South Korea can buy and sell the won, and it doesn't trade outside local market hoursâ€”a cumbersome arrangement for foreign investors who want to convert currency so they can buy or sell stocks. South Korea is now considering lengthening trading beyond the London market open and allowing offshore trading after the domestic market closes.</p><p>\"After experiencing 1997, the stability of our currency has been a top priority,\" said Dong-ick Kim, director of the international finance division at South Korea's economy and finance ministry. \"It hasn't been an easy problem to tackle, but we are now confident that we have the policy tools to upgrade market structures akin to a developed market.\"</p><p>Mr. Kim said South Korea has sufficient foreign-exchange reserves, with abundant U.S. dollars onshore, to free up trading. The won and economic growth have both shown resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic, he added. The government is also contacting foreign investors about these proposals, as MSCI considers investor feedback in its decisions, he said.</p><p>\"We are committed to making the necessary improvements to make trading of our currency more accessible to foreign investors,\" said Mr. Kim.</p><p>MSCI said its annual reviews evaluate economic development, plus market size, liquidity and accessibility, and are based on \"independent and objective analysis which takes into account the views of global investors.\" It added that \"investors' experience of market accessibility, rather than merely an abstract analysis of regulatory language,\" was important to its decisions.</p><p>Many overseas investors have already gotten comfortable with investing in South Korean stocks. Foreign investors accounted for 32.5% of the total capitalization of stocks in the Kospi as of Wednesday, according to Korea Exchange data.</p><p>Another potential concession would be to allow short selling, or betting on price declines, for smaller stocks. The Financial Services Commission banned almost all such trades early in the pandemic to stabilize stocks, and the regulator has since lifted the ban only for larger shares. The ban cost South Korea points on MSCI's June 2021 \"market accessibility\" rating.</p><p>The head of Korea Exchange said last month that the country should examine a full resumption of short selling. The decision lies with the financial regulator, not the exchange.</p><p>Some investors question whether South Korea's government will do enough to win an upgrade.</p><p>\"The real issue here is Korean officials and the government may not want to give full control, partly due to the Asia financial crisis and trauma that Korea experienced then,\" said Chang Hwan Sung, a multiasset portfolio manager at Invesco. \"It boils down to how much freedom the markets are given, and small adjustments might not be satisfactory.\"</p><p>Write to Frances Yoon at frances.yoon@wsj.com</p><p>South Korea Wants to Graduate From Emerging Markets</p>",
