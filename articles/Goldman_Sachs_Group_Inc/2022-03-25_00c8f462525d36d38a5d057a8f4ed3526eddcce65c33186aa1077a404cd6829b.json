  "text": "<p>The leadership duo hoping to unseat Generali's management at a crunch annual meeting next month have promised higher earnings growth, sweeping cuts and more deals at Italy's largest insurer as they unveiled a make-or-break alternative strategy to investors.</p> <p>Entitled <a href=\"https://www.awakeningthelion.com/\">“Awakening the Lion”</a>, a nod to Generali's nickname as the Lion of Trieste, the presentation was made with the backing of top-three Generali shareholder Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone. It is being seen by analysts as a crucial moment in a months-long battle for the direction of the group.</p> <p>Claudio Costamagna, a former Goldman Sachs banker who has been proposed by Caltagirone as Generali's chair as part of a rival list to the company's preferred candidates, and Luciano Cirinà, a current top manager at the insurer who has been proposed as chief executive, unveiled an ambitious 14 per cent earnings growth target over the next three years. </p> <p>That is about double the 6 to 8 per cent figure contained in the plan <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/74a8e4e9-0d9f-4bd2-9bd2-21d09fd6ef22\">unveiled</a> by Generali chief executive Philippe Donnet in December. </p> <p>Mergers and acquisitions worth up to €7bn, including in India and China, would be a substantial part of their plan, the challengers added. </p> <p>“It's a matter of rebalancing the business [in favour of more profitable sectors like asset management] and being more ambitious on acquisitions,” Costamagna said on Friday. </p> <p>However, analysts expressed scepticism about overly ambitious targets and a lack of detail about how they would be financed and achieved. “Significantly larger efficiency targets were presented, but poorly supported in our view [and] also with a tight delivery schedule and being revenue dependent,” analysts at Citigroup said. </p> <p>Exane BNP Paribas said the 14 per cent target “would not just beat the existing Generali plan but would lead the entire sector. If you offer this to investors you need to be prepared to back it up. We don't feel we got that today.”</p> <p>In an interview with the Financial Times before the plan was unveiled at Milan's Four Seasons hotel, Costamagna said “the most common definition [of Generali] was a sleeping beauty. It has huge potential, but still halfway sleepy and we want to awaken it.” </p> <p>He said the group would not rule out raising fresh capital, if his candidacy is successful, to finance deals. </p> <p>In contrast, Donnet warned in December that it would be “risky” to focus a growth plan on M&amp;A which “by definition is the only thing that cannot be planned”.</p> <p>The challengers also plan to create an executive committee and introduce a general director figure aimed at diminishing the chief executive's power. </p> <p>The presentation came ahead of a key vote on the renewal of Generali's board next month, with Caltagirone and fellow shareholder, billionaire Leonardo Del Vecchio, pitted against Generali's biggest shareholder Mediobanca, which supports Donnet. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Cirinà said the plan was based on publicly available company figures but that it did not take into account potential negative impacts on Europe's economic growth linked to the war in Ukraine. </p> <p>The Generali executive told analysts he had not actively worked on drafting the rival plan “but had given input”.</p> <p>Before being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2665a524-8b62-4feb-84b7-4faffb0911b4\">suspended</a> from his role as Generali's head of Austria and central Europe earlier this week, Cirinà was one of Donnet's closest colleagues and had helped draft the group's December strategy. </p> <p>“I worked on that plan for the parts that pertained to [my remit], but I am not going to expand on the personal reasons that have led me to join the [rival camp],” he said.</p> <p>The 79-year old Caltagirone, who briefly appeared at the Four Seasons event, accused Donnet of concentrating too much power into his own hands in an interview with Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore.</p> <p>In a statement on Friday, Generali said that under Donnet's leadership, the company had “successfully executed two strategic plans” and its latest plan had been “received very positively by the financial market”. </p> <p>Shares in Generali closed up 1.9 per cent at €19.42. </p><p>Source: Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli in Milan, Ian Smith and Stephen Morris in London 2022 'Rival top team at Generali sets out alternative plan to investors' FT.com 25 March.
