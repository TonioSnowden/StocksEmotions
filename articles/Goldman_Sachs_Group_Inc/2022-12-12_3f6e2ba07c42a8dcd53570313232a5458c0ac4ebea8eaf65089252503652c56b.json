  "title": "C-Suite Strategies (A Special Report) --- What's Ahead for Global Finance: The CEO of Goldman Sachs on financial markets and risks",
  "text": "<p>WSJ: Are we in a new world of higher interest rates and higher inflation? Or are we going to see a reversal toward what we've seen over recent years?</p><p>MR. SOLOMON: The pandemic disrupted supply chains, and then we saw a meaningful fiscal stimulus. Another black-swan event was the war. It's not surprising that that's led to inflation.</p><p>We're in the process of trying to unwind that. Naturally, you're seeing monetary policy shift relatively quickly, so we're in a period of higher rates. Now the the market's making an assumption that the Federal Reserve will stop raising rates sometime soon.</p><p>But we're still early in this. I think it's uncertain. And we still have a pretty strong economy. If you look at service industries, and you look at how tight labor is at the moment, we still have a ways to go to get to the right balance. Anybody who tells you they know, they don't know.</p><p>WSJ: One of the big changes in the world over the last year or so has been the Ukraine war, the cutting off of energy supply to Europe. We've had a lot of tension with China, people trying to reshore their production and diversify away from reliance on China. How do you see the outlook for globalization?</p><p>MR. SOLOMON: Over the last few decades we've operated with an ethos of, \"Make it in the place where it's as inexpensive as possible, and sell it in the place where you can accomplish the higher margin.\".</p><p>Now people are rethinking with certain things -- with energy, food, minerals, certain healthcare needs, microchips.</p><p>People are saying, \"I need security. I have to consider cost and friction.\" There are some things where cost and friction don't matter; what matters is security, access, stability. That is a more permanent shift. But that doesn't mean we're deglobalizing. That just means that we're choosing much more carefully and a little bit more thoughtfully who our partners are on certain things. That's only getting amplified because at the moment the geopolitical world has gotten more complex.</p><p>WSJ: I want to do a very quick-fire set of questions, just give me a prediction about whether these things are going to be up or down in a year's time. U.S. stocks in a year's time?</p><p>MR. SOLOMON: Lower.</p><p>WSJ: Treasury yields.</p><p>MR. SOLOMON: Slightly stronger.</p><p>WSJ: Treasury yields, 10-year.</p><p>MR. SOLOMON: If you get a soft landing you'll see 10-year higher. If you don't you're going to see a reversal of policy, and then you could see rates the same or lower.</p><p>WSJ: Soft landing, yes/no?</p><p>MR. SOLOMON: Can I say 35%?</p><p>WSJ: Oil.</p><p>MR. SOLOMON: Higher.</p><p>WSJ: Residential real estate.</p><p>MR. SOLOMON: Lower.</p><p>WSJ: Crypto.</p><p>MR. SOLOMON: I find cryptocurrencies, bitcoin, those things that people are speculating on, completely uninteresting, not really relevant, not in our mind-set. We're focused on the ability to innovate in financial services, to innovate with financial infrastructure. We did a bond just last week for the European Investment Bank that we settled in 90 seconds instead of the normal three to five days that it would take.</p>",
