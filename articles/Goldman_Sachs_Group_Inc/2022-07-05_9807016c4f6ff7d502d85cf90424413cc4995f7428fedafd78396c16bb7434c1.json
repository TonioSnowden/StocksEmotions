  "title": "U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid Resign From Boris Johnson's Government; Prime minister's most senior ministers both quit his cabinet, a move that will test his ability to retain power",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Sunak said in his resignation letter that the public expected the government to be \"conducted properly, competently and seriously.\" Mr. Javid in his letter said that he could \"no longer in good conscience\" continue serving in Mr. Johnson's government.</p><p>Several other Tory lawmakers in his party made public statements Tuesday evening, also demanding Mr. Johnson quit. An official close to Mr. Johnson said the prime minister wouldn't quit.</p><p>Instead, he moved quickly to rejigger his cabinet, appointing Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi as treasury chief. Mr. Zahawi will likely immediately come under pressure from Conservatives to reverse a planned rise in corporate taxes scheduled for next year. With Mr. Johnson's political authority undermined, analysts see him agreeing to tax cuts to appease members of his party.</p><p>The catalyst for the resignations is the culmination of a series of scandals—notably over parties held in Downing Street during Covid-19 lockdowns—and growing unease in the ruling Conservative Party about both Mr. Johnson's conduct in office and how he intends to manage a snowballing economic crisis. Inflation rose to 9.1% last month, its highest level in 40 years, and economists say it is on track to hit double digits by the end of the year.</p><p>This combination of factors now means that Mr. Johnson's future as prime minister looks extremely uncertain. Increasingly deprived of political capital, Mr. Johnson is struggling to hold together a voter base that spans traditional fiscal conservatives and the blue-collar workers who voted for the Tories for the first time in the last election. Mr. Johnson is under growing pressure from some Tory lawmakers to announce tax cuts to help people with a cost-of-living crisis, but economists warn tax cuts could fuel further inflation.</p><p>Tuesday's rebellion sets the stage for a high-stakes political battle as the 58-year-old looks to cling to power. Last month, Mr. Johnson survived a no-confidence vote held by the Conservative Party in which 41% of his lawmakers voted to oust him, a surprisingly large number.</p><p>That leadership challenge was brought about in part after Mr. Johnson was fined by police for attending his own birthday party during a Covid-19 lockdown and after assuring lawmakers that no parties had taken place in Downing Street.</p><p>After the no-confidence vote, Mr. Johnson promised lawmakers that he would ensure his Downing Street operations were no longer plagued by scandal. However, just this week Mr. Johnson apologized after a senior lawmaker in his party quit for allegedly groping two men.</p><p>\"After all the sleaze, the scandals and the failure, it's clear that this government is now collapsing,\" said opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer.</p><p>On paper, Mr. Johnson enters this battle for political survival from a position of relative strength. He presides over a large majority in Parliament, and under Conservative Party rules there can't be another leadership challenge for a year. The next general election doesn't have to be held until early 2025. However, rebels in his party are considering whether to force a change to the Conservative Party rules so that another leadership challenge can be held sooner, according to people close to them.</p><p>Mr. Johnson—who has repeatedly proved to be a political Houdini—could choose to tough it out and refuse to quit, analysts say. It could take months of rolling rebellions and a further confidence vote to oust him. The lack of an obvious Tory successor to him also makes his hand stronger, analysts say.</p><p>On Tuesday evening, several cabinet members, including Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, expressed support for Mr. Johnson as he reshuffled loyalists into senior roles. Steve Barclay, a former Brexit minister, was named health secretary. Mr. Zahawi, the treasury choice, is an Iraqi-born lawmaker who previously founded a successful polling company.</p><p>Much now depends on whether Conservative lawmakers believe that Mr. Johnson's reputation as a vote-winning machine persists. The recent loss of two special elections that saw Tory districts vote for opposition parties has tarnished it. On Tuesday, a poll by YouGov showed that 54% of people who voted Conservative in the 2019 election thought Mr. Johnson should quit.</p><p>The loss of Mr. Sunak, a former Goldman Sachs banker who is among those tipped to succeed Mr. Johnson, is a particular blow as the country enters a period of deep economic uncertainty. The Bank of England expects inflation to hit 11% later this year, and some economists predict a looming recession.</p><p>In his resignation letter, Mr. Sunak said that a low-tax, high-growth economy could be delivered only \"if we are prepared to work hard, make sacrifices and take difficult decisions.\" The amount of tax the government collects relative to the economy's size is on course to be the biggest since the early 1950s, according to the U.K.'s Office for Budget Responsibility. The government has pledged to reduce some taxes before the next election, which is due no later than January 2025.</p><p>Mr. Javid's resignation was less of a surprise. The health secretary had previously been pushed out by Mr. Johnson as treasury chief. He had returned during the Covid-19 pandemic after the previous health secretary was filmed kissing an aide.</p><p>The mutiny by the two ministers came during another difficult day for Mr. Johnson's party. This week, Mr. Johnson faced criticism from Tories over the resignation of a deputy whip, Chris Pincher, who allegedly groped two men and has allegedly made several unwanted advances on men in the past. Mr. Johnson's team initially put out a statement saying he had no prior knowledge of Mr. Pincher's prior behavior.</p><p>The government said Tuesday that Mr. Johnson had been briefed on this behavior back in 2019 but said he had subsequently forgotten about it. Mr. Pincher has apologized for the behavior. Mr. Johnson said on Wednesday that appointing Mr. Pincher \"was a mistake.\"</p><p>Footage of a cabinet meeting in Downing Street on Tuesday morning showed Mr. Johnson attempting to rally glum-looking ministers. Some junior ministers, long considered loyal to Mr. Johnson, also quit Tuesday.</p><p>\"I feel too long we have been focused on dealing with reputational damage than delivering for the people of this country,\" wrote Jonathan Gullis, a junior minister in a resignation letter.</p><p>More on Boris Johnson's Government</p><p>Read related content selected by WSJ editors</p><p>* Fresh Scandal Threatens to Tarnish Boris Johnson and Tory Party (July 4)</p><p>* Boris Johnson's Conservatives Suffer Blow in U.K. Special Elections (June 24)</p><p>* Johnson Survives No-Confidence Vote Over Lockdown Parties (June 6)</p><p>* Johnson Urges Lawmakers to Move On After Damning Report on Lockdown Parties (May 25)</p><p>Write to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com</p><p>U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid Resign From Boris Johnson's Government</p>",
