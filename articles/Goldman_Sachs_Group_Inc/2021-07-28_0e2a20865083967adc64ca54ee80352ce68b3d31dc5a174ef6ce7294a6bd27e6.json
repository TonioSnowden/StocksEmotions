  "text": "<p>The chief executive of DWS, one of Europe's largest investors, has dismissed the escalating regulatory crackdown in China as “noise”, arguing the asset management industry should take a long-term view in a country it is betting will deliver vast profits.</p> <p>DWS first pushed into China more than a decade ago but is now seeking to expand more aggressively as asset managers race to establish a foothold in an economy where the savings market is expected to grow rapidly.</p> <p>“In China you need a long-term view,” said Asoka Woehrmann, chief executive of the €859bn German asset manager. “All asset management businesses need a long-term view but in China especially. You can't go there and expect results immediately; it's an investment for the long term.”&#xa0;</p> <p>The comments come as a regulatory assault from Beijing has deepened this week, spreading from the tech sector to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/206435e1-294d-43f2-96d2-5207ecf8afcc\">education companies</a> offering private tuition. Shares in some of the country's largest tech companies have tumbled both in New York and Hong Kong. </p> <p>Addressing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/097879d6-a845-4c11-89fc-69f50f9021df\">this week's turmoil</a>, Woehrmann said “there's always some noise around China and uncertainty. You have to learn to deal with these uncertainties.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Formerly known as Deutsche Asset Management before it was spun out from the bank and listed in 2018, DWS has operated in China for 16 years. It bought a stake in Harvest Fund Management in 2005, creating the largest Sino-foreign joint venture asset management company in China. </p> <p>Since then, it has jointly developed some products with Harvest to distribute to the clients of the Chinese group, whose assets under management rose to $203bn at the end of 2020. DWS received €63m of income last year from its 30 per cent stake in Harvest, and €49m in the first six months of this year, according to company filings.&#xa0;</p> <p>“China is a very important market for us,” said Woehrmann. “It was a manufacturing country that then became the world's biggest consumer market. It is now building up a savings industry — this is why it's attractive to asset managers.”</p> <p>The efforts by western asset managers to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5e09db3-549e-4a0b-8dbf-e499d0606df4\">prise open the Chinese market</a> has gathered momentum in recent years despite the country's trade wars with the US and difficult relations with the UK.</p> <p>BlackRock, Goldman Sachs Asset Management and JPMorgan Asset Management in the US, as well as European rivals <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ded2ae2-1160-4167-b856-5a2e38e17472\">Amundi</a> and Schroders, are all expanding there, lured by the opportunity of a growing domestic asset management market, worth an estimated $18.9tn last year.</p> <p>Woehrmann said that DWS wanted to expand further in China and Asia through joint ventures, mergers or acquisitions, as part of its wider strategy to take part in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/092d8b5c-14cd-4499-9745-a1bc71cc951d\">the consolidation</a> that is sweeping across the fund management industry. Earlier this week, DWS was among those that submitted a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/090f12ff-7f3d-4b67-8b24-4bf72c8c1e4f\">final bid</a> for NN Investment Partners, €300bn investment management arm of the Dutch insurer, a person familiar with the situation said.</p> <p>DWS on Wednesday revealed net inflows of €19.7bn in the second quarter, as strategies including environment, social and governance as well as passive and higher-margin funds pushed its overall assets under management to €859bn. </p> <p>It reported a cost-income ratio — a key measure of profitability — of 60.6 per cent in the second quarter, down from 65.8 per cent a year earlier. Profits rose to €247m in the quarter, up about 30 per cent from a year ago.</p><p>Source: Harriet Agnew, Asset Management Editor 2021 'Top European investor says Chinese regulatory crackdown is ‘noise'' FT.com 28 July.
