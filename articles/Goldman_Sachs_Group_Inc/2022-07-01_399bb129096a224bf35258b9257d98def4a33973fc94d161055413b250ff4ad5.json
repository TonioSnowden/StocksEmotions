  "text": "<p>Daniel Adamson, president, Capital Constellation</p><p>\"A Beautiful Question: Finding Nature's Deep Design\" by Frank Wilczek</p><p>The first time I finished this book, I started it again, and though I've now read it countless times, each time I learn something new. Through this process, [I] have developed a deeper appreciation for nature's design and the people—from Plato to Wilczek himself—who help to reveal it.</p><p>Thibault Basquin, deputy head of Ardian Buyout and executive board member of Ardian US LLC</p><p>\"The Heart of Business: Leadership Principles for the Next Era of Capitalism\" by Hubert Joly</p><p>I truly believe that business should be a force for good. This is an extraordinary on-point guide for all who aspire to lead with purpose and understand the importance of putting people first.</p><p>John Bradley, senior investment officer, Florida State Board of Administration</p><p>\"The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music\" by Dave Grohl</p><p>If you're a fan of music and biographies, this book about Dave's experience growing up and then becoming a member of Nirvana and Foo Fighters is a great read. It's entertaining and even inspirational.</p><p>Lori Campana, partner, Monument Group</p><p>\"Horse\" by Geraldine Brooks</p><p>I would recommend the book about the greatest racehorse that lived and the contrast and unfortunate realities of past and present racial inequities.</p><p>Eva Davis, partner, Winston &amp; Strawn LLP</p><p>\"The Island of Extraordinary Captives: A True Story of an Artist, a Spy and a Wartime Scandal\" by Simon Parkin.</p><p>During World War II, Great Britain captured Austrian- and German-born boys and men who were residing in the United Kingdom and imprisoned them on the Isle of Man. In the worst sort of irony, many of the prisoners were Jews, musicians and intellectuals who had escaped Nazi terror only to be captured in their land of refuge. Through the eyes of young Peter, we learn how this community of artists is able to survive while being suspected as enemy spies. Described as ‘Britain's grave wartime mistake,' the somber circumstances still provide hope, healing, friendship and community in the unlikeliest of places.</p><p>Nigel Dawn, head of private capital advisory group, Evercore Inc.</p><p>\"Good Pop, Bad Pop\" by Jarvis Cocker, former lead singer of the band Pulp</p><p>I grew up in Sheffield listening to Pulp in the local pubs before they became major stars. Jarvis was in the same grade, but at a different school. This is a wonderful trip down memory lane, with Jarvis describing how he got Pulp started.</p><p>Mark Evans, principal investment officer, Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds</p><p>\"Dirtbag, Massachusetts: A Confessional\" by Isaac Fitzgerald</p><p>I am looking forward to picking up this book, which comes out in July. It looks interesting, and I'm a softy when it comes to stories connected to my home state.</p><p>Brian Gallagher, co-founder and partner, Twin Bridge Capital Partners</p><p>\"Destiny of the Republic: A Tale of Madness, Medicine and the Murder of a President\" by Candice Millard</p><p>I tend to read historical nonfiction and this is a great book about James Garfield, a very impressive person whose presidency was cut tragically short. It is a fascinating story from U.S. history that few people know.</p><p>Pamela Hendrickson, vice chairman, the Riverside Co.</p><p>\"The Naked Don't Fear the Water: An Underground Journey With Afghan Refugees\" by Matthieu Aikins</p><p>This beautifully written book chronicles the journey of a journalist (Matthieu) and his friend Omar as they flee the Taliban takeover of Kabul. Their harrowing journey helps one to understand the plight of migrants as well as the amount of persistence and courage it takes to cross borders whether physical or mental, socio-economic or ethnic.</p><p>Harold Hope, partner and managing director, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p><p>\"Freezing Order: A True Story of Money Laundering, Murder and Surviving Vladimir Putin's Wrath\" by Bill Browder</p><p>When Bill Browder's young Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, was beaten to death in a Moscow jail, Mr. Browder set on a mission to track the $230 million tax refund scheme that his lawyer was killed over and discovered that the Russian President Vladimir Putin was a beneficiary of the crime.</p><p>Molly Murphy, chief investment officer, Orange County Employees Retirement System</p><p>\"The Confidence Code; The Science and Art of Self-Assurance—What Women Should Know\" by Katty Kay and Claire Shipman.</p><p>I find nonfiction very interesting when it is related to human experience. Real human stories intrigue me more than fictional stories, as I always find something that resonates with my own life. This book, focused on women, has been recommended by many friends and I am finding it fascinating.</p><p>Yup Kim, head of investments, private equity, California Public Employees' Retirement System</p><p>\"High Growth Handbook: Scaling Startups from 10 to 10,000 People\" by Elad Gil</p><p>Elad Gil is an entrepreneur, operating executive and investor or adviser to private companies such as Airbnb Inc., Coinbase, Instacart and Pinterest, and is co-founder and chairman at Color Health Inc., which provides technology, software and clinical services for population health programs.</p><p>Mark Viviano, managing partner, Kimmeridge Energy Management</p><p>\"Giannis: The Improbable Rise of an NBA Champion,\" by Mirin Fader</p><p>My 9-year-old daughter and I agreed to read the same book this summer and she chose Mirin Fader's biography of Giannis Antetokounmpo. Much more than your typical story of a famous athlete's rise to stardom, it explores deeper issues of immigration, racism and xenophobia while offering life lessons about family first and maintaining humility in the face of success.</p><p>Michael McGirr, director of private equity, Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board</p><p>\"No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention\" by Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer</p><p>Mass PRIM's book club last read this book. I wouldn't want to see the correlation between me reading that book and Netflix's stock price though.</p><p>John Stewart, founding partner, MiddleGround Capital</p><p>\"The Fifth Risk: Undoing Democracy\" by Michael Lewis</p><p>The book highlights the consequences if the people given control over the U.S. government have no idea how it works.</p><p>Rory Quinlan, co-founder and managing partner, Quinbrook Infrastructure Partners</p><p>\"How the World Really Works,\" by Vaclav Smil</p><p>Vaclav Smil claims the answer to his book titled: ‘How the World Really Works' lies in four ‘grand transitions' of civilization—in populations, agriculture, energy and economics—which have transformed the way we live. He observes that we have never had so much information at our fingertips, yet most of us don't know how the world really works. While this may only be somewhat true, Smil's latest book is informative and a good read for the lay person interested in the energy transition, and it offers a much-needed reality check on the gap that exists between the rhetoric of climate change and the real world we live in.</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com, Luis Garcia at luis.garcia@wsj.com and Laura Kreutzer at laura.kreutzer@wsj.com</p>",
