  "title": "Inside Archegos's  Epic Meltdown  ---  Banks were -2-",
  "text": "<p>   Because of Archegos's highly concentrated positions, the sharp drop in Viacom hit the fund's portfolio, and many in the market believe that Archegos started selling other stocks to cushion the blow. Those sales sent other stocks it held tumbling, including Discovery. Suddenly, the collateral Archegos had given the banks was no longer enough to back the loans. Banks hit Archegos with margin calls to back up its trades, which initially were met by the fund, but as ViacomCBS fell further on Wednesday, the firm didn't have the money to provide its lenders, a person involved in the unwinding said. </p><p>   That forced the banks to sell Archegos's collateral holdings even as they were tumbling, worsening the selloff. Archegos reduced some of its holdings on Thursday and ViacomCBS shares fell more steeply. </p><p>   When Archegos called its banks for a meeting, they all had different opinions on how to handle the situation. </p><p>   Representatives from Credit Suisse and Nomura, which faced the most extreme losses, suggested working together over a month to unwind Archegos's trades. </p><p>   Representatives from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs balked at even the idea of doing so, saying that within a day or two the market would get wind of the amount of stock that needed to be sold and pummel them. </p><p>   The call ended Thursday night as the Asian stock market was about to open. The fire sale began. </p><p></p>",
