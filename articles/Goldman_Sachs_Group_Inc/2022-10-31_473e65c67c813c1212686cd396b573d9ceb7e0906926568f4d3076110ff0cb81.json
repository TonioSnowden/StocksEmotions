  "title": "Vietnam's Goldilocks Growth Phase Is Over; Country will likely be among Asia's fastest growers next year, despite a weaker currency and falling foreign reserves",
  "text": "<p>The situation could get even trickier for Vietnam if the world slides into a recession. It may have to widen its trading band again and tolerate further currency weakness—while continuing to raise rates. However, thanks to investments in infrastructure, aggressive trade liberalization and relatively cheap wages, its manufacturing engine remains intact. Vietnam also has the advantage of starting from an enviable growth position: roaring at 13.7% year on year in the third quarter on the back of strong exports to the U.S.</p><p>Nevertheless, the State Bank of Vietnam is clearly playing catch up. The central bank only began its tightening cycle in September.</p><p>Instead, for most of 2022 the government relied on spending down forex reserves and fuel tax cuts to support the currency and fight off inflation. The country has also been partly insulated from the global surge in food prices—it is among the leading rice producers and exporters globally.</p><p>That seemed to work well for a while: Headline consumer inflation was only 2.9% year over year as recently as August, and even now it clocks in at 4.3%, low by regional standards. But beneath the surface, things have started to look more troubling. Core inflation hit nearly 4.5% in October, its highest since at least early 2015, according to CEIC.</p><p>At the same time, exports are now facing increasing headwinds. They dropped 5.1% month on month seasonally adjusted in September, according to Goldman Sachs.</p><p>After a tough 2020 and 2021, Vietnam spent much of 2022 in the sweet spot—still-low inflation and rapid growth. Times will get a bit tougher now, but the country is poised for fast growth next year—Natixis is forecasting 6.5%, while Capital Economics expects more than 7%—and the weakening currency may help soften the blow from weaker export demand.</p><p>Vietnam's post-pandemic salad days may be over, but most countries would still kill for growth numbers like that amid a global slowdown.</p><p>Write to Megha Mandavia at megha.mandavia@wsj.com</p><p>Vietnam's Goldilocks Growth Phase Is Over</p>",
