  "title": "Stocks Edge Higher to End a Choppy Week; Fading hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon stop raising interest rates has caused jitters in stocks",
  "text": "<p>A slowdown in inflation sent stocks ripping higher last week, and the dollar and bond yields into retreat. The S&amp;P last week wrapped up its best stretch since the summer. But in recent days, hopes that the Federal Reserve will back off its campaign of aggressive interest-rate increases have faded somewhat.</p><p>\"We had a 6% rally in the S&amp;P 500 last week. We don't think the Fed wants to see a return of the animal spirits,\" said Derek Amey, co-chief investment officer at StrategicPoint Investment Advisors in Rhode Island. Mr. Amey said he is hiding out from the volatility by holding industrials and healthcare stocks along with bonds.</p><p>Central-bank officials including St. Louis Fed President James Bullard made the case this week to keep raising rates to curb decadeshigh inflation. Mr. Bullard said Thursday that the Fed's policy rate could rise higher than traders in interest-rate futures are expecting.</p><p>Strong labor-market and retail-sales data, meanwhile, suggested the economy has a way to go before higher borrowing costs cause the kind of downturn that could prompt the Fed to reverse course. All of that has sent jitters through the stock market and pushed bond yields upâ€”though the S&amp;P 500 is still about 10% higher than its recent low on Oct. 12.</p><p>On the economic front, U.S. existing home sales fell for a ninth straight month in October as high mortgage rates pushed buyers out of the market.</p><p>\"There is nothing that guarantees that inflation is behind us,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. \"Where it settles out is really what's most important here. Do we go back to its pre-Covid trend of 1 to 2% or settle out at 3 to 4%?\"</p><p>Mr. Boockvar said he's betting that inflation will be around 3% to 4% in 2023. He plans to continue holding Treasury inflation-protected securities and stocks within the precious metals and energy sectors, which tend to do better in inflationary times.</p><p>While investors' attention is squarely on the Fed and inflation, some money managers see a separate threat to the stock market's recent rally in a drop in analysts' forecasts for earnings over the next year.</p><p>Adding to the angst, Treasury yields are inverted, with short-term U.S. government borrowing costs above longer-term yields. That dynamic has, in the past, often been predictive of a recession.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.817% from 3.774% Thursday.</p><p>Traders were also watching the expiration of nearly $1.1 trillion worth of options tied to indexes and exchange-traded funds. Though the figure is mostly in line with non-quarterly expires over the past two years, it could still inject further volatility in the market, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.</p><p>Many investors expect the Fed to stop raising rates early next year but to keep them elevated for sometime before loosening monetary policy. That could continue to challenge equities, particularly the ones with lofty valuations.</p><p>In stocks, Ross Stores rose 10%. The off-price retail and home-accessories store operator raised its guidance for the fourth quarter and topped sales and earnings forecast.</p><p>Shares of Grindr surged more than 200% after the LGBTQ-focused social network and dating app completed its merger with special-purpose acquisition company Tiga Acquisition Corp.</p><p>Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, fell 2.4% to $87.62 a barrel, extending two weeks of declines. Oil prices have been hurt by demand getting dragged down further in China, the world's biggest consumer of commodities, because of a surge in Covid-19 cases.</p><p>Turbulence in the crypto industry caused by the downfall of exchange FTX hasn't seeped into broader financial markets. On Friday, cryptocurrencies were stable, with bitcoin trading almost flat compared with Thursday evening at about $16,600.</p><p>European markets rallied after retreating Thursday. The Stoxx Europe 600 gained 1.2%, led higher by shares of utilities and auto companies. Shares in the region have jumped since late September, boosted by falling natural-gas prices and easing concerns about energy shortages this winter.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com and Hardika Singh at hardika.singh@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Edge Higher to End a Choppy Week</p>",
