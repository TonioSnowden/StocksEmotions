  "text": "<p>The White House said on Monday night it would lift the travel ban that has been in place since early last year on non-US citizens arriving to the US from the UK, the Republic of Ireland, the 26-nation Schengen common visa area of Europe and Brazil. </p> <p>But a spokesman for the incoming president Joe Biden contradicted the announcement and said the ban <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae505da8-d38b-4e8a-85dd-b346e5d23660\">would stay in place</a> to stop the spread of coronavirus.</p> <p>“With the pandemic worsening, and more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel,” Jen Psaki, Mr Biden's incoming White House press secretary, wrote on Twitter.</p> <p>The confusion marks the start of Donald Trump's final full day in office, when he is expected to <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/17/politics/trump-pardons-expected/index.html\">issue more than 100 pardons</a> and commutations. </p> <p>Meanwhile, as Mr Biden prepares to be sworn in as the 46th US president, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94db9b9b-243b-4ce8-9e10-452fadc523ec\">protected by thousands of National Guard troops</a>, he is facing a massive political challenge.</p> <p>Having won the White House by projecting a mix of competence, empathy and renewal to American voters after four years of Trumpism, he will have to translate all that into governing at a wrenching moment in US history.&#xa0; </p> <p>Politically as much as economically, Mr Biden has reason to go big, urges <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65f7dabb-78ec-47bf-b460-b7b0b8c3fed7\">our editorial board</a>, to tackle the economic and health crises facing the country. More than a decade ago, Barack Obama trimmed his fiscal stimulus to account for conservative opposition and was subsequently routed in midterm elections. Democrats are well aware that to be successful, Mr Biden <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa01bc64-a80c-4c32-abad-f8eb778c4fe6\">will need to show rapid concrete results</a>.

(FT)</p> <p><strong>Mexico could find Biden a truculent neighbour</strong> President Andrés Manuel López Obrador kept things sweet with Donald Trump in exchange for little US “interference” with his domestic agenda, said one member of the US transition team. “A Biden presidency <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc8251af-807b-4252-8d35-1c775d3af221\">could be quite uncomfortable</a> for Amlo,” he added.

(FT)</p> <p><strong>How the far-right fell in line with Trump </strong>White supremacists tended to shun electoral politics as a feature of the corrupt world, scholars have said. But the outgoing US president has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6da53be7-e809-48d2-99f6-0e1348e68391\">served as a beacon</a> for a motley crew of extremists and a bridge to mainstream politics.
