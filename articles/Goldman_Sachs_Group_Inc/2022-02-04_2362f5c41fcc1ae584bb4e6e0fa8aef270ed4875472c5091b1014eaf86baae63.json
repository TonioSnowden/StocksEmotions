  "text": "<p>\"We have a high degree of confidence in Kohl's transformational strategy, and we expect that its continued execution will result in significant value creation,\" said Kohl's Chairman Frank Sica.</p><p>In January, Kohl's received an offer from a group backed by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP. The offer represented a 37% premium to Kohl's share price at the time. Kohl's shares were up 1.9% at $59.72 in early-afternoon trading Friday.</p><p>The private-equity firm Sycamore Partners also recently approached Kohl's and said it could pay around $65 a share, though it hasn't submitted a formal offer, according to people familiar with the matter. Oak Street Real Estate Capital LLC is a possible bidder for Kohl's real estate, The Wall Street Journal has reported.</p><p>The Kohl's board has formed a committee of independent directors to review its options and has hired Goldman Sachs and PJT Partners as advisers.</p><p>Kohl's has repeatedly been the target of activists in the past year, despite efforts by the company's chief executive to boost performance. CEO Michelle Gass has forged partnerships with Amazon.com Inc. and Sephora, brought in new brands and beefed up its loyalty program.</p><p>She also overhauled the merchandise, dropping poorly performing brands such as Dana Buchman, and bringing in new ones, including Tommy Hilfiger, Eddie Bauer and Cole Haan. She expanded the selection of activewear from brands such as Nike Inc., Adidas AG and Under Armour Inc.</p><p>Yet, the retailer's stock price had languished prior to the recent takeover interest.</p><p>Write to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com</p><p>Kohl's Rejects $9 Billion Takeover Bid, Adopts Poison Pill</p>",
