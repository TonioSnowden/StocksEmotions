  "title": "Fund Gets  $2.75 Billion  Emergency  Backing  ----  By Juliet Chung",
  "text": "<p>   Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management are investing $2.75 billion in hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, an emergency influx of cash expected to stabilize what was previously one of the top-performing funds on Wall Street. </p><p>   Melvin has been hard hit by a series of short bets, starting the year with $12.5 billion in assets and losing almost 30% through Friday, people familiar with the firm said. Among other short positions, Melvin bet against the surging stock of videogame retailer GameStop Corp. </p><p>   Citadel and its partners are investing $2 billion and Point72, which already had more than $1 billion invested in Melvin as of 2019, is investing an additional $750 million, the funds said Monday. As part of the deal, Citadel, its partners and Point72 are receiving noncontrolling revenue shares in the firm that eventually expire, a person familiar with the deal said. </p><p>   Melvin founder Gabe Plotkin was a top portfolio manager at Point72's predecessor firm, SAC Capital Management, before he left to start Melvin. </p><p>   He put together the deal on Monday with Citadel founder Ken Griffin and his former boss, Point72's Steven A. Cohen, people familiar with the matter said. </p><p>   The injection of cash has the effect of reducing Melvin's reliance on borrowed money and, thus, the likelihood of margin calls from Melvin's prime brokers, some of the people familiar with Melvin said. </p><p>   On Monday, several investors said they retained faith in Mr. Plotkin and his team and said they couldn't make sense of the retail activity in some heavily shorted stocks that has sent their prices surging. One cited Melvin's return of more than 50% last year after fees and said Mr. Plotkin had a significant reservoir of goodwill remaining with his clients. </p><p>   Melvin had been down about 15% for the year through late last week, but heavily shorted stocks soared on Friday. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s basket of the 50 stocks with the highest short interest as a share of market capitalization rose Friday, bringing its gains for the year to 25%. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.4% for the period. Unlike many other hedge funds, Melvin has an expansive and aggressive short book. </p><p>   Even some of Melvin's long positions temporarily worked against the fund on Monday. Some other funds, worried about Melvin abandoning its positions, reduced their holdings in companies like Clorox Co. and Expedia Group Inc., traders said. </p><p>   Mr. Plotkin said Monday: \"I am incredibly proud to partner with Ken Griffin and Steve Cohen. The team at Melvin is eager to get to work and reward the confidence of these two great investment icons.\" </p><p>   Point72 founder Mr. Cohen  called his former employee \"an exceptional investor and leader. We are pleased to have the opportunity to invest additional capital.\" </p><p>   Citadel founder Mr. Griffin applauded Melvin's results over the history of the firm and said: \"We have great confidence in Gabe and his team.\" </p><p></p>",
