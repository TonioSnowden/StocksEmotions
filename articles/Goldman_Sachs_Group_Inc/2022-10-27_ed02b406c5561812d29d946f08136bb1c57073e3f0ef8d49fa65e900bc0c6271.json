  "title": "U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Wealth Is Targeted by Critics; New leader's fortune emerges as a potential problem as he pushes spending cuts",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Sunak and his Conservative Party have responded to the criticism by saying that what matters are his actions, not his bank account. On Wednesday, he pointed to his work as chancellor of the exchequer during the pandemic, when he oversaw a government program to pay wages to millions of British workers on behalf of companies to ensure they wouldn't lose their jobs.</p><p>\"What I can say, as we did during Covid, we will always protect the most vulnerable,\" he said. Mr. Sunak promised his government would always support nurses, who are threatening to go on strike in coming weeks, with \"strong pay increases\" and more training.</p><p>Political analysts say Mr. Sunak's wealth, especially at a time of economic hardship, is likely to remain in focus, but are split over whether it will make a difference to how he enacts policy and his performance at the ballot box.</p><p>\"His wealth will make it difficult, because he may have to go further than someone who is less wealthy to prove that he is sensitive to the needs of the vulnerable as he looks at how the pain from spending cuts is distributed,\" said Vernon Bogdanor, research professor at the Centre for British Politics and Government at King's College London.</p><p>The previous richest prime minister was Edward Stanley, an aristocrat who led the country in the second half of the 18th century and had a personal fortune in excess of £7 million, according to the Guinness Book of Records. Taking into account inflation since the last year of his government, 1868, that would be worth about £613 million in today's money, according to the Bank of England's inflation calculator. Still, the wealth of historical British leaders is hard to calculate given much of it would have been based on land ownership.</p><p>The Sunday Times Rich List's estimate of the combined wealth of Mr. Sunak and his wife, Akshata Murty, comes in large part from her near 1% stake in Infosys Ltd., an India-based technology-and-consulting company founded by her father.</p><p>Mr. Sunak, though, wasn't born as wealthy. He made his own money during a career at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and as a hedge-fund manager. He has spoken of how his father, a doctor in Britain's government-run healthcare system, and his mother, who runs a family-owned pharmacy in southern England, worked hard to give him access to a world-class education.</p><p>\"I'm not going to apologize for what they did for me,\" he said in August. \"And in fact, that's why I want to do this job because I want to provide those opportunities for everyone else.\"</p><p>The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, on Wednesday asked whether Mr. Sunak would remove so-called non-domiciled tax rules that allow foreign residents in Britain to not pay U.K. tax on their worldwide income. This year, Ms. Murty changed her tax arrangements after the Independent newspaper reported she had benefited from the rules, a revelation that severely dented her husband's popularity polling. Mr. Sunak didn't answer the question.</p><p>The Labour Party is expected to continue highlighting Mr. Sunak's wealth as the U.K. economy moves into what is expected to be a shallow but long recession in the coming months.</p><p>\"Of course people are questioning how he can comprehend how others are coping\" with the cost of living, said Rachael Maskell, the Labour member of Parliament for York, a neighboring constituency to Mr. Sunak's.</p><p>Wyn Grant, a British political expert and author, said that Mr. Sunak's wealth will only truly hurt his popularity if other things go wrong for him.</p><p>\"That sort of thing has more traction if things go badly, if they go reasonably well, it will be less of an issue,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Sunak's family owns a five-bedroom house and an apartment in Kensington, one of London's most expensive neighborhoods; a centuries-old mansion in Mr. Sunak's political constituency in northern England; and a penthouse in Santa Monica, Calif., according to the rich list. Mr. Sunak hasn't commented publicly on the properties, and U.K. leaders don't typically release their tax returns.</p><p>A Downing Street spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr. Sunak's personal wealth.</p><p>Mr. Sunak has been pictured wearing suits from London's tony Savile Row, where tailoring costs thousands of dollars. He recently attracted widespread mirth on social media for visiting one of Britain's poorest areas in footwear made by Italian luxury group Prada SpA. He didn't deny the expensive clothing but said he should be judged on his actions.</p><p>Asked what word they most associate with Mr. Sunak, respondents to an October poll from market-research company Savanta Group said, \"rich.\"</p><p>Mr. Sunak became prime minister after promises of unfunded tax cuts by predecessor Liz Truss led to a selloff in the pound and government debt, raising inflation and borrowing costs and leading to her eventual resignation. The new leader is now expected to make government spending cuts that will likely hit public services.</p><p>Other Tory leaders have had their wealth highlighted in periods of national belt tightening. Fellow Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron reined in public spending after his election in 2010, leading to frequent references to the wealth and elite schooling of his family and that of his Treasury chief, George Osborne. The wealth of Margaret Thatcher's business executive husband, Denis, was often referred to in the media.</p><p>U.S. leaders have also been targeted by rivals for their perceived wealth. Some critics accused President John F. Kennedy's family of buying his election victory, while Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was often accused of being out of touch due to his wealth. Still, in the U.S., wealth can also be used as an advertisement, with former President Donald Trump and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg referencing their billions of dollars while campaigning.</p><p>Write to Alistair MacDonald at Alistair.Macdonald@wsj.com</p><p>U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Wealth Is Targeted by Critics</p>",
