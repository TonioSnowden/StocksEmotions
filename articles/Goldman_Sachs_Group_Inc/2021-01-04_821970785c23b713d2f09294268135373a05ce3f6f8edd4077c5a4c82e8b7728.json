  "text": "<p>Looking toward the year ahead, our Chris Cumming notes that the industry is getting set for a rebound in fundraising, with limited partners eager to place more bets in the sector. But the process of gathering fresh commitments could still be elongated by the pandemic's lingering effects and the trend toward familiar fund sponsors is expected to continue. At asset-management giant BlackRock, rounding up a $12 billion debut private-equity fund proved to be too ambitious, the Journal's Dawn Lim reports, and the firm has scaled back those plans.</p><p>Meanwhile our Laura Cooper says the pace of deal making could pick up quickly amid pent-up demand for investments and a burgeoning supply of dry powder in the hands of buyout shops. I offer a look at Ares Management 's record-setting European lending fund and our Laura Kreutzer looks back at a few of the trends that defined last year. All that and much, much more await, so please launch your 2021 here...</p><p>Today's Top Stories</p><p>Private-equity fundraising in 2020 was disrupted by the social distancing and travel restrictions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, but as Chris Cumming reports, the industry is preparing for a rebound in 2021. Limited partner appetite for the asset class is stronger than ever and growth in distributions at the end of the year is leaving them with more cash to commit. However, the threat of renewed restrictions and lingering economic uncertainty mean it could still take firms longer to reach the finish line than anticipated and many investors are likely to still stick with tried and true managers.</p><p>Private-equity deal activity may have been stymied by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 but as the industry heads into a new year, investors are eagerly making up for lost time, as Laura Cooper reports this morning. A pipeline of pent-up deal supply, combined with a massive amount of dry powder available for private-equity firms to invest, low interest rates and greater clarity into how businesses are weathering the coronavirus pandemic, is bringing buyers and sellers back to the negotiating table.</p><p>BlackRock Inc . planned to shake up the private-equity world with a $12 billion fund. Now the asset-management giant is setting its sights lower, Dawn Lim writes in The Wall Street Journal. BlackRock's staffers conceded the target was unrealistic after struggling to meet fundraising goals. The firm's staffers hope to grow the fund to between $4 billion and $6 billion in assets over time, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Ares Management Corp . has smashed through the record for Europe-focused private-credit funds, raising more than $11 billion so far, Ted Bunker reports for WSJ Pro Private Equity. Ares set the previous record at €6.5 billion (equivalent to $7.96 billion now) in 2018. The firm had actually surpassed that figure by the end of September, according to Michael Arogheti, Ares president and chief executive.</p><p>Kreutzer's Take: Four Trends That Shaped Private Equity in 2020</p><p>By Laura Kreutzer</p><p>As 2020 draws to a close, many are relieved to put the year behind us, even as we recognize many of the challenges faced this year will still affect us in the year ahead.
