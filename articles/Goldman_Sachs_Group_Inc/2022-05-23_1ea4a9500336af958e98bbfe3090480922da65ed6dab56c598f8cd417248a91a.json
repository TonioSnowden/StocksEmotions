No other school has topped all three FT executive tables at the same time.</p> <p>The school's success comes as many of the world's leading academic institutions report a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3f282b2-d0e1-40cf-b51a-35794f7dd7c3\">surge in demand for non-degree courses</a> as the Covid-19 pandemic eases, writes <em>Andrew Jack</em>, global education editor.</p> <p>In our league table of customised business programmes, tailored to the needs of companies and organisations, <a href=\"https://rankings.ft.com/rankings/2871/executive-education-custom-2022\">70 schools are featured</a>.

It included 110 targets, each with staff assigned to monitor them.</p> <p>“There are only two that matter: scholarship and pedagogy. Any sane organisation would look at the administrative overheads and try to remove them,” says Professor Devinney, now chair of international business at Alliance Manchester Business School.</p> <h2>Data line: Leadership is the key skill to learn in 2022</h2> <p>Leadership is the top learning priority for executives, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0eda49c0-0f64-495f-a056-60885e41ac62\">FT's second annual chief learning officers survey</a>, this year.
