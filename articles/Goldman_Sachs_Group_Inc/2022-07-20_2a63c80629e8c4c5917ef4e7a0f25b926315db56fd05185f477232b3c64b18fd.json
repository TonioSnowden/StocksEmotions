  "title": "Stock Futures Inch Up on Earnings Reports; Netflix shares jumped premarket after the streaming service said it lost fewer subscribers last quarter than expected",
  "text": "<p>Stocks have swung in recent days, buffeted by earnings season which has been scrutinized for signs about how the highest inflation in more than four decades and slowing economic growth are affecting companies. Recent reports from companies such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup came in above Wall Street's expectations, even though both banks reported declines in profit.</p><p>\"Earnings have been supportive of the narrative that growth isn't falling off a cliff,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. \"It doesn't necessarily look like a recession is coming.\"</p><p>Shares of Netflix rose 7% in premarket trading. The streaming service said it lost fewer subscribers last quarter than it had expected, in its earnings report released Tuesday after hours. It forecast it would add 1 million net new subscribers in the current quarter.</p><p>Insurer Elevance Health, oil-services firm Baker Hughes and Nasdaq are scheduled to post earnings on Wednesday before the opening bell. Results from Tesla and United Airlines are expected after markets close.</p><p>Bond markets reflected a more pessimistic view. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was little changed, edging down to 3.015% from 3.017% on Tuesday. Yields fall when prices rise. The yield on shorter-dated bonds remained higher, with the 2-year yield at 3.223%. This is known as an inverted yield curve and is a popular recession predictor.</p><p>Oil prices ticked down. Brent, the global benchmark for crude, declined 1.2% to trade at $106.08 a barrel, reversing direction after three consecutive days of gains.</p><p>\"Energy prices reflect the wider sentiment in the market. What's creating this volatility are higher chances of a recession,\" said Antonio Cavarero, head of investments at Generali Insurance Asset Management.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.3%. Uniper, a German utility, gained 7% on reports that the Nord Stream 1 pipeline is likely to resume some gas flows from Russia after its maintenance period ends on Thursday.</p><p>Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi is set to address parliament on Wednesday to discuss his resignation and next steps. Markets are reflecting an expectation that Mr. Draghi will stay in his role, investors said. He indicated on Wednesday morning that he will do so if he wins a parliamentary vote.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Italian government bond declined to 3.183% and its spread with the German benchmark narrowed to 1.98 percentage points.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks rose. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.1%. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 2.7% ahead of the country's earnings season kickoff.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Inch Up on Earnings Reports</p>",
