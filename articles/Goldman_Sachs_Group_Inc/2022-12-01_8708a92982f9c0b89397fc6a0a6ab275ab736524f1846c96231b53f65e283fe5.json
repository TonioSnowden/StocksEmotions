  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start:</strong> A US private equity group <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/30a358b3-54f4-419e-ba5b-d41123464469\">has resumed talks</a> to buy Italy's largest petroleum refinery from Russia's Lukoil. Crossbridge Energy Partners, with the financial backing of commodity trader Vitol, is negotiating an agreement with Lukoil that would value the Sicily-based ISAB refinery at between €1bn-€1.5bn.</p> <p><strong>In today's newsletter:</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p>SBF explains himself</p></li>  <li><p>Wall Street's new day-trading hobby</p></li>  <li><p>Nestlé's dealmaking regrets</p></li> </ul> <h1>FTX: IOU's are as good as money</h1> <p>For weeks, DD has been trying to conceptualise the spiralling mess at<strong> FTX</strong>.</p> <p>Here's where we're at: it's <em>Dumb and Dumber</em> meets <em>Lord of the Flies</em>. </p> <p>Let us explain.</p> <p>There's a central problem for the creditors hoping for a recovery from the implosion of <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>'s FTX. The company's young employees spent valuable resources like drunken sailors, but much of what's left behind are speculative IOUs in the form of illiquid crypto tokens.</p> <p>The FT's Nikou Asgari and Joshua Oliver <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7cfbb894-a332-4629-a417-4bcda27eb6e7\">report on the culture inside FTX</a>, where a lack of internal controls meant that spending went largely unchecked.</p> <p>FTX's employees paid hundreds of millions of dollars for property in the Bahamas where the firm was located, $135mn for naming rights to a Miami basketball stadium and even racked up a $55,319 tab at the <strong>Margaritaville Beach Resort</strong> in Nassau.</p> <p>“[It was] kids leading kids,” said one former employee. “The entire operation was idiotically inefficient, but equally mesmerising,” they added. “I had never witnessed so much money in my life. I don't think anybody had, including SBF.”</p> <p>Ultimately, the company once valued at $32bn operated in a manner befitting of the children lampooned in <strong>William Golding</strong>'s <em>Lord of the Flies</em>, albeit with far more cash. “It just kinda went crazy,” said one employee.</p> <p>After the spending binge, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/913ff750-d1f4-486a-9801-e05be20041c1\">included massive political contributions</a> and billions spent on acquisitions and investments in venture funds and start-ups, there's not much cash left.</p> <p>FTX <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f05fe9f8-ca0a-48d5-8ef2-7a4d813af558\">had less than $1bn</a> in liquid assets against nearly $9bn in liabilities and a negative $8bn entry described as “hidden, poorly internally labled ‘fiat@' account”, the FT reported in November.</p> <p>Much of what remains are tokens such as <strong>Serum</strong> and <strong>FTT</strong> of questionable worth. One valuable asset is a 7.6 per cent stake in online trading company <strong>Robinhood</strong>. </p> <p>The problem is bankrupt cryptocurrency lender <strong>BlockFi</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1719e122-3b50-4d86-9a30-9fe72f2286fe\">claims</a> it is the rightful owner of the stake and is suing SBF to seize shares it says he pledged as collateral just days before his exchange collapsed.</p> <p>SBF included the Robinhood shares on FTX balance sheets presented to potential rescue investors and even privately negotiated to sell the shares on <strong>Signal</strong>, according to messages seen by the FT.</p> <p>The situation is reminiscent of the 1994 comedy <em>Dumb and Dumber</em>. </p> <p>Characters played by <strong>Jim Carrey</strong> and <strong>Jeff Daniels</strong> find a suitcase filled with cash and go on a spending spree, buying Lamborghinis and ugly suits, as they try to return it. They credit their spending with IOUs. “That's as good as money, sir. Those are IOUs. Go ahead and add it up, every cent's accounted for,” says Carrey's character Lloyd Christmas.</p> <p>On Wednesday, SBF used the New York Times' Dealbook conference to explain himself, stating he “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2abfb546-cd8f-4945-89f8-218607ac2768\">never tried to commit fraud</a>” while admitting he made “a lot of mistakes”.</p> <p>Ultimately, SBF took the Lloyd Christmas approach. “There are a lot of assets that are on hand here, though many are not liquid . . . I think there is a shot for real value.”</p> <p>One prominent onlooker found it convincing. “Call me crazy, but I think @sbf is telling the truth,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1598086237969338368\">tweeted</a> hedge fund billionaire <strong>Bill Ackman</strong>.</p> <h1>Dawn of the day traders</h1> <p>Trading in meme-stocks may have died down, but there's a new casino game attracting interest on Wall Street.</p> <p>Professional traders are diving into so-called <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/a09bd3b3-1188-47d1-a2ae-645c04ab3d11\">zero-day options</a>, derivative contracts that are bought or sold on the day they expire, DD's Eric Platt and the FT's Nicholas Megaw report.</p> <p>The surging volumes — now accounting for more than two-fifths of daily trading in <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> index options — have captured the attention of trading desks, not least because some believe the derivatives are contributing to recent wild swings in stock markets.</p> <p>One thing to get out of the way before we go further: the name “zero-day options” can be confusing given the actual derivatives being traded are weekly contracts that are bought or sold on the day that they expire (ie there are “zero days” until they expire).</p> <p>The trading shift was spurred by new products from exchange operator <strong>Cboe Global Markets</strong>. In an attempt to capitalise on the boom in options trading, it launched new weekly options on the <strong>S&amp;P 500</strong> index that expire on Tuesdays and Thursdays, joining the pre-existing products that expire on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.</p> <p>The new set of days means investors can trade large sums of options that mature each day of the week — including as zero-day options when they're on the cusp of expiry.</p> <p>So why does it matter? The jump in options trading could be contributing to the wild intraday market swings registered this year. Market makers that sell options contracts will hedge their positions to avoid making a bet on the market's direction. But that hedging can, at times, accelerate broader shifts.</p> <p>“As options activity goes up, this can create bigger swings,” said<strong> Garrett DeSimone</strong>, head of quantitative research at <strong>OptionMetrics</strong>. Recent studies have led to the theory that option sellers' so-called gamma exposure could increase volatility, he added. </p> <p><strong>Nomura</strong> analyst <strong>Charlie McElligott </strong>posited that some financial institutions had been behaving like “full-tilt day traders”, trying to “weaponise” the phenomenon to “amplify and ‘juice' the intended directional market move”.</p> <h1>Nestlé's M&amp;A regrets</h1> <p>It's not often that the head of a large company publicly admits its dealmaking was a mistake. But Nestlé's chief executive <strong>Mark Schneider</strong> is feeling frank. He has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5408a77b-31fc-494c-9b9e-f6736338dfa1\">acknowledged two dealmaking missteps</a>.</p> <p>First, its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/355c51ae-650f-4ee3-8742-bfd3fef0dbc2\">$2.6bn purchase</a> of <strong>Aimmune Therapeutics</strong> in 2020 — the company behind a medication aimed at combating the frequency and severity of allergic reactions to peanuts in children. It has received “slower than expected adoption by patients and healthcare professionals'‘, Nestlé said. </p> <p>The company has launched a review of the peanut medication and said it will explore options, which could result in a partnership or a sale.</p> <p>Second, <strong>Schneider </strong>expressed regret over a $950mn acquisition of meal kits start-up <strong>Freshly </strong>the same year, which will soon merge with <strong>Kettle Cuisine</strong>, a premium food manufacturer owned by <strong>LVMH</strong>-backed private equity group <strong>L Catterton</strong>.</p> <p>Nestlé will be left with a minority stake in the group that delivers ready-to-cook meals, a business model that has slowed since widespread Covid-19 lockdowns ended.</p> <p>The disappointing deals sting that much more given that inflation <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/26315077-0ac0-4b79-9792-35ff5e7225ee\">has taken a toll</a> on the Swiss food company's profitability, Lex notes.</p> <p>Long referred to as the man who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4394e53-0560-4f9f-b604-16d0a4484eaa\">turned round Nestlé</a>, Schneider is no doubt eager to reinforce his reputation. The company has had a net annual return on acquisitions between 11 and 13 per cent since 2018, “with a large majority of transactions at or above their business plans”, the company said. </p> <p>The owner of two labradoodles, Schneider is now turning to pet food — as well as coffee — for growth. The idea is that, even as consumers re-evaluate everyday purchases, these won't be hit as hard.</p> <p>Some bankers might be quietly hoping the pet food growth isn't M&amp;A-driven. They have been known to eat pet food during deal pitches in order to show their enthusiasm for the product. </p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>David Lipton</strong>, the international affairs counsellor to <strong>US Treasury</strong> secretary <strong>Janet Yellen</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/business/economy/david-lipton-step-down-treasury.html\">is stepping down</a>, according to The New York Times.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>UBS </strong>veteran<strong> Mark Lewisohn</strong> <a href=\"https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/ubs-veteran-lewisohn-departs-after-33-years-at-the-swiss-bank-20221130?mod=topStories\">is leaving</a> the Swiss bank after 33 years, per Financial News.</p></li>  <li><p>Law firm <strong>Dechert</strong> has appointed partners<strong> David Forti </strong>and <strong>Mark Thierfelder </strong>as co-chairs and partners <strong>Sabina Comis</strong> and <strong>Vincent Cohen Jr</strong> as its first global managing partners.
