  "text": "<p>Brooklyn, N.Y. -- The broad-brush and rosy-hued understanding of America's involvement in World War II resembles an old western movie, with the cavalry rushing in to save the day. There is an appealing romanticism in this view, but today even nonhistorians recognize its simplicity, or rather its distorted view of history, particularly with regard to the incomprehension -- a gentle term -- of the extent of the Holocaust.</p><p>Americans do not, until the end, play a significant role in \"Remember This: The Lesson of Jan Karski,\" a moving and powerful solo show starring the veteran actor David Strathairn, written by Clark Young and Derek Goldman. A portrait of an average man -- albeit an unusually cosmopolitan and sophisticated one -- bearing witness to the awful realities of the wholesale slaughter of the Jewish populace, sadly to little avail, the play revisits how the world failed so tragically to understand the full extent of the Nazis' Final Solution until it was far too late.</p><p>Karski was a Polish Catholic who recognized from a young age the anti-Semitism that infected much of Europe. Portraying the title character (as well as many other roles), Mr. Strathairn's Karski recounts how children in his native Lodz would torment or bully Jewish boys, while Jan counted them his closest friends in school.</p><p>History would soon sweep him and his country into its cruel arms, when World War II broke out. Karski, who was training to be a diplomat, was recruited to defend his country from the invaders. In harrowing accounts, we learn of his abuse both at the hands of the Soviets and the Germans, as Poland was alternately occupied by each.</p><p>Eventually he escaped to become a member of the Polish underground tasked with relaying the increasingly horrific details of the treatment of Polish Jews both to the country's government in exile and, later, to the U.S. (A particularly chilling detail: The Polish government refused to publicize the details of what Karski witnessed.)</p><p>Mr. Strathairn does not turn the play into a slick actor's tour-de-force. Certainly he has the skills to portray an infinite variety of characters, but he recognizes that the material is of primary importance here. Even when he is playing his Nazi tormentors, or Karski's sister, whose husband was killed by the Nazis, or, ultimately, the Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter and President Franklin Roosevelt, Mr. Strathairn, under the restrained direction of Mr. Goldman, keeps us locked into the memory of the central character. We are reliving, with him, the moment-by-moment crucible of his experience.</p><p>The performance contains a remarkable element of physicality, as Karski endures brutal torture, and at one point jumps from a moving train in order to spread the message of the Nazis' treatment of Poland's Jewish populace to the world. Mr. Strathairn seems to be channeling the fortitude that Karski needed to draw on -- endless treks in addition to the savage beatings -- to infuse his performance with an anguished intensity but also a towering strength. With only a wooden table and chairs onstage, Mr. Strathairn brings alive the physical challenges of Karski's grim odyssey through Nazi-occupied Poland.</p><p>\"Remember This\" does not always tread with a light foot -- not that the material would justify any tap-dancing. Perhaps the bookending scenes might have been excised. Mr. Strathairn plays a generic \"man\" who lectures us about the dire state of the world: \"Every day it becomes more and more fractured, toxic, seemingly out of control. We are being torn apart by immense gulfs of selfishness, distrust, fear, hatred, indifference, denial.\"</p><p>This portentous underscoring of the contemporary significance of the play would be revelatory only to the more clueless of ostriches. Certainly those in attendance will absorb the story's timelessness without having it written in large type on a metaphorical chalkboard.</p><p>\"Remember This\" immerses us much more powerfully in the experience of Karski himself. The culminating scenes are particularly sobering. Karski eventually finds his way to the U.S. in 1943, and describes what he has seen to, first, Frankfurter, and subsequently Roosevelt. Frankfurter -- who was himself Jewish -- responds, \"I know humanity. I know men. Impossible.\" I won't divulge details of the even more jaw-dropping interview with Roosevelt, except to say that it involves a question not about the fate of the Jews in Poland, but about . . . horses.</p><p>Although, as mentioned, I do not think the framing adds much to the power of the play, certainly some of the more salient lines reverberate, with reference to the terrible myopia that prevailed as the Jewish people were being all but extinguished in Europe. \"Human beings have infinite capacity to ignore things that are not convenient,\" Mr. Strathairn, as the \"man,\" says. Not convenient? An understatement, to say the least.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Isherwood is the Journal's theater critic.</p>",
