  "title": "Housing Crash Can't Bring a Shale Boom",
  "text": "<p>In a report published in December, Goldman Sachs noted the main source of labor supply in the shale industry is typically from the housing market. After all, a portion of the work on the oil field looks a lot like construction, such as creating a road, moving sand, water or chemicals, and pouring concrete, notes Jesse Thompson, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.</p><p>This dynamic between the shale and housing labor market was perhaps the most apparent in 2008-10, when the housing crash coincided with a shale boom. Unemployment in construction went to a peak of 27% in early 2010 from 16.5% in August 2009. Unemployment in oil and gas fell to 10.7% from 11.8% and kept falling to a trough of 3.5% in 2011.</p><p>This year, the labor market has been incredibly tight for construction and oil and gas production. The unemployment rate in the U.S. oil and gas sector hit a 17-year low in July and again in October at 0.8%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of November, the unemployment rate in construction remained low at 3.9%. Wage growth has been healthy for both sectors this year, well exceeding the 5% year-over-year pay bump that the entire labor force saw in November.</p><p>Housing construction has started slowing down. Single-family housing starts fell 32% in November compared with a year earlier. It has been declining every month since February. If that declining housing-start trend continues next year, as the National Association of Home Builders expects, it could help free up workers for the oil and gas sector.</p><p>This time, a loosening of the labor market isn't likely to precipitate a production boom that will knock oil prices down. One reason is that fracking, thanks to technological advances and efficiency gains, is no longer as labor-intensive as it used to be, notes Mr. Thompson. Another is that capital isn't as readily available as it was back in prior shale booms, with energy investors demanding better returns and interest rates continuing to go up. Importantly, supply of equipment remains constrained and energy-services companies are hesitant to invest heavily in new capacity.</p><p>That said, a loosened labor market could help fatten the bottom line for services providers, for whom labor comprises a large portion of operating expenses. Helmerich &amp; Payne, an onshore drilling services provider, said in a November earnings call that 70% to 75% of its daily costs are labor-related.</p><p>For investors worried about a downturn in housing construction next year, an energy-service company stock could turn out to be a good hedge.</p>",
