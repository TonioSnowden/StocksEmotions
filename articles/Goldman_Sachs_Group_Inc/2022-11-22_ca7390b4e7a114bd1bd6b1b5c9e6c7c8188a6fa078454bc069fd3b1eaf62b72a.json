  "text": "<p>* S&amp;P 500 futures ES00 rose 10 points, or 0.2%, to 3968</p><p>* Dow Jones Industrial Average futures YM00 added 77 points, or 0.2%, to 33812</p><p>* Nasdaq 100 futures NQ00 climbed 28 points, or 0.2%, to 11616</p><p>On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 45 points, or 0.13%, to 33700, the S&amp;P 500 SPX declined 15 points, or 0.39%, to 3950, and the Nasdaq Composite COMP dropped 122 points, or 1.09%, to 11025. The S&amp;P 500 is up 10.4% from its 2022 closing low hit on Oct. 12, but remains down 17.1% for the year to date.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Stock futures were a touch firmer but traders seemed reluctant to place bold bets as they weighed concerns about fresh COVID-19 restrictions in China and the prospects for tighter Federal Reserve policy.</p><p>Adding to the caution was a holiday-shortened week for Wall Street, where volumes traditionally tend to thin notably in the run up to Thanksgiving on Thursday and Black Friday.</p><p>\"The irony is that the China reopening story has been a big positive driver of China-related risk and overall markets over the last couple of weeks, so we are trading between feast and famine on this story,\" wrote Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, in a morning note.</p><p>\"Both could of course be ultimately right. There might be many more restrictions in the near term but stronger more durable re-openings by the spring. Markets are struggling to price this at the moment though,\" Reid added.</p><p>The lackluster action in stocks also reflects a market that has stalled following a rally off 2022 lows, and as investors look to the next catalyst to help push the S&amp;P 500 out of its recent relatively tight range of roughly 50 points, on a closing basis, held over the past two weeks.</p><p>The ceiling of that range is 4,000, and unfortunately for equity bulls it is unlikely the S&amp;P 500 will finish much above it even in a year's time, according to Goldman Sachs.</p><p>In a note published late on Monday, the Goldman strategy research team led by David Kostin, said that assuming the U.S. economy manages a soft landing then the stock market will experience \"less pain but also no gain\" in 2023.</p><p>\"The performance of U.S. stocks in 2022 was all about a painful valuation de-rating but the equity story for 2023 will be about the lack of EPS growth. Zero earnings growth will match zero appreciation in the S&amp;P 500. Our valuation model implies an unchanged P/E multiple of 17x and a year-end index level of 4000,\" said Kostin.</p><p>Emblematic of the market's travails over the past year or so are the share price collapses of former lockdown-linked work from home darlings, such as Zoom ZM. Stock in the videoconferencing group was off about 9% in premarket trading having delivered soft fourth quarter guidance after Monday's closing bell.</p><p>There are no U.S. economic updates of note set for release on Tuesday. However, Kansas City Fed President Esther George is due to speak at 2:15 p.m.</p><p>U.S stock futures rise amid cautious trading as Thanksgiving looms</p>",
