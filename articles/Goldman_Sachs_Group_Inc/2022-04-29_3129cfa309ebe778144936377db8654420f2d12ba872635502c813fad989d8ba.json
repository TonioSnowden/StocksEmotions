  "text": "<p>Nor should any rival expect to match the Berkshire/Buffett model, which is a product of inimitable personality and circumstance. But being a \"cafeteria Buffett\" is possible: picking the best practices that suit. Many companies have emulated parts of the Berkshire model well and there are plenty of executives as talented as Buffett when it comes to investment savvy or managerial insight.</p><p>Two of my favorite Berkshire/Buffett oddities concern how they find acquisitions and how they approach price.</p><p>To generate acquisition opportunities, they rely on their professional network. They put the word out that they are always open to acquisition opportunities within specific parameters and then look for business relationships to tee them up.</p><p>On price, they almost never haggle over but rather put their first-and-best offer up front. They know what things are worth and know what they are willing to pay. They are also perfectly happy to walk away from any opportunity and part friends.</p><p>A favorite story concerned a company called Tech Data, which reached out to Berkshire during its go-shop period for another merger. Berkshire made a proposal, Tech Data countered for more, Berkshire said no and walked, and the company was ultimately acquired by its initial pursuer.</p><p>For my book, Berkshire Beyond Buffett: The Enduring Value of Values, I collated the sources and pricing of Berkshire Hathaway acquisitions and present updated versions through the most recent acquisition, of Alleghany, in the charts below.
