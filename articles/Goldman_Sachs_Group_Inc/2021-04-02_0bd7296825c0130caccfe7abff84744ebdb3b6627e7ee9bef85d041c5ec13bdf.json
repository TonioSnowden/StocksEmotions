But we'd just like to take a moment to thank all of you who have been reading the newsletter, attending our events and subscribing to the FT over the past four years since we created this briefing — Arash, JFK and the whole DD gang.</p> <p><strong>And one gigantic scoop:</strong> Greensill Capital's administrator <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe234f59-75b9-44f7-af8a-f05e588957b7\">has failed to verify</a> invoices underpinning loans to Sanjeev Gupta, after companies listed on the documents denied that they had ever done business with the metals magnate.</p> <p><strong>Welcome to Due Diligence, your briefing on dealmaking, private equity and corporate finance from the Financial Times.

Get in touch with us anytime: </strong><a href=\"mailto:Due.Diligence@ft.com\">Due.Diligence@ft.com</a><strong>.</strong></p> <h2>So you thought 2020 was crazy?&#xa0;</h2> <p>It's been a year since office workers abandoned their desks en masse to work from bedrooms, kitchen tables and, for the lucky few, bookcase-lined home offices with a newly installed <strong>Peloton</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>However crazy the markets and the dealmaking landscape might have looked back then (stocks tumbled, transactions were undone, dealmaking was paused), things are arguably wilder now — but in the opposite direction.&#xa0;</p> <p>Here are a few of the things that have happened as the first quarter of 2021 came to a close:&#xa0;</p> <ul>  <li><p>The S&amp;P <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32862618-64b4-48b3-acdf-e04d4efb745f\">hit a new record</a> on Thursday, passing 4,000 points for the first time, propelled by technology shares</p></li>  <li><p>Dealmaking had its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bacdf86f-e786-4439-966e-f5958adb1c59\">strongest-ever start</a> to the year, with deals worth $1.3tn agreed, more than any first quarter since records began in 1980</p></li>  <li><p>Banks had their most lucrative quarter in at least 20 years, bringing in more than $37bn in total fees&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Private equity groups raised more than $20bn in the US leveraged loan market in a fresh quarterly high, loading companies they own with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/32184b16-1982-45e7-b1b4-ab10b1be81ec?shareType=nongift\">fresh debt</a> to award themselves a bumper payday</p></li>  <li><p>Spacs <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/321400c1-9c4d-40ac-b464-3a64c1c4ca80\">raised more money</a> in under three months than they'd raised in an already heady 12 months in 2020&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Venture capitalists invested at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e6b7543-3000-45e5-aee8-e8ccc9b5f661\">fastest pace</a> in more than a decade</p></li>  <li><p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/3c1fa744-9de0-4398-a6cc-16e430d8a8dd\">GameStop saga</a> detached share prices from corporate realities, while the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db4508ed-ccb4-48f6-8dd6-dd7d38e3cfa4\">Archegos selling frenzy</a> exposed how it's possible for a little-known family office to make incredible use of leverage</p></li> </ul> <p>Here's how that looks for M&amp;A:</p> <p>Bankers, lawyers and dealmakers are mostly in a celebratory mood, if they can actually believe their eyes. “The rebound from a year ago is more dramatic than anything we've ever seen in M&amp;A recovery — full stop,” <strong>Cary Kochman</strong>, co-head of global mergers and acquisitions at <strong>Citigroup</strong>, told the FT.&#xa0;</p> <p>Spacs are driving more of the activity than ever before — take a look at this chart:</p> <p>Everyone seems buoyed by huge stimulus measures, vaccine rollouts and lockdowns easing as spring begins, even as the prospects for many industries remain uncertain — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/731ec423-03dc-405c-9ff4-f8670b953f2d\">France</a> is set to shut down again and close its schools.&#xa0;</p> <p>In part, the dealmaking boom can still be traced back to the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong>'s stimulus package in April last year, which boosted confidence and triggered a market rally that's been hard to stop. With a ton of essentially free money floating around, caution isn't exactly the dominant mood.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's tough to be a sceptic in an exuberant market, but it's worth looking a little closer.&#xa0;</p> <p>Sticking just to the M&amp;A side of things: prices are high, but there's little time for due diligence in the race to strike deals, leading some to cut corners.&#xa0;</p> <p>In the words of <strong>Simona Maellare</strong>, global co-head of financial sponsors at <strong>UBS</strong>: “When you combine the two, it's explosive.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Read the full <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bacdf86f-e786-4439-966e-f5958adb1c59\">report</a> by DD's Kaye Wiggins and Ortenca Aliaj.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Can the Hamptons handle its latest Wall Street residents?</h2> <p><strong>Blackstone</strong>,<strong> Elliott Management</strong>, <strong>Icahn Enterprises</strong>, <strong>Citadel</strong>,<strong> Goldman Sachs</strong>, <strong>SoftBank</strong> — these are a few of the DD regulars that moved jobs and investments to Miami. And who could blame them?</p> <p>As tumbleweeds rolled down Wall Street, there was little point in braving the sub-zero streets for a mouthful of <strong>Carbone</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.miaminewtimes.com/restaurants/restaurant-review-carbone-miami-opens-in-south-beach-with-red-sauce-classics-11869133\">spicy rigatoni alla vodka</a> when it had just opened a South Beach outpost.</p> <p>But spring has sprung in New York City, and vaccinations are on the rise. Along with them — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7468c289-df8d-4649-a2f0-bf6397bd477b\">real estate prices</a> in the Hamptons, one of Long Island's wealthiest enclaves.</p> <p>If the pandemic has taught us anything, it's the appeal of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7db6dbe2-5ac5-4e08-9ec5-f72f0bc1f5aa\">flexible working</a>. And as the city and its neighbouring luxe Hamptons hamlets reopen, you can now have your spicy rigatoni and eat it too.

One junior employee <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-14/goldman-ceo-s-year-of-empty-offices-island-getaways-and-strife?sref=OziMsGoK\">learnt the hard way</a>.)</p> <p>A “little piece of paradise”, as one private equity dealmaker and Hamptons resident described it to DD, the easternmost tip of Long Island has long been an exclusive haunt for the rich and famous.</p> <p>Junk bond billionaire <strong>Ira Rennert</strong>'s 100,000-square foot Sagaponack compound shocked “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/23/nyregion/millionaire-s-mega-mansion-shocks-even-the-hamptons.html\">even the Hamptons</a>” when it was constructed for $110m in 1998. It was said to be worth about $500m as early as 2015, <a href=\"http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20150224/FINANCE/150229943/lawyer-to-jury-ignore-ira-rennerts-500m-mansion\">one real estate broker told Crain's</a>.</p> <p>The median price of a Hamptons home sold in 2020 was $1.695m, 17 per cent higher than in 2019, according to real estate group <strong>Serhant</strong>.</p> <p>But as the Covid-fuelled New York exodus and subsequent shift to hybrid working transforms the area from a vacation town to an extension of the city, locals are being further edged out of their own community.</p> <p>Southampton's year-round population has grown from 58,398 in 2019 to roughly 80,000, <strong>Jay Schneiderman</strong>, a Hamptons official, told the FT.</p> <p>As the mega-rich pulled strings to procure ventilators and built <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09b48bce-67fd-11ea-a3c9-1fe6fedcca75\">private intensive-care units</a> in their mansions, longtime Hamptons residents were left to share one local hospital with an unprecedented number of off-season visitors.</p> <p>Local infrastructure just isn't prepared to support all the new Hamptonites, the official said, as local WiFi and waste management services reach their breaking points.</p> <p>The perma-vacationers are helping support local businesses, at least, who depend on tourists to survive and saw their income plummet in 2020.</p> <p>After a disastrous spring and summer, the influx of winter business had been vital, said restaurateur <strong>Pierre Weber</strong>, owner of <strong>Pierre's</strong> in Bridgehampton.</p> <p>If you do decide to venture out east this summer, DD does not particularly recommend <strong>The Sloppy Tuna</strong> — the Montauk beach bar that lives up to its name in spades.</p> <p>However, it has been the subject of a scintillating Wall Street <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-the-hamptons-iconic-sloppy-tuna-got-tangled-in-a-messy-wall-st-skirmish-150318104.html\">courtroom drama</a>. And they make a stiff Dark n' Stormy.</p> <h2>Musical M&amp;A</h2> <p>Last month <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10ca8739-4a09-4286-919f-7d99d3c5e600\">we unpacked</a> the curious deal between <strong>Jack Dorsey</strong>'s fintech group <strong>Square</strong> and <strong>Jay-Z</strong>'s underperforming music streaming platform <strong>Tidal</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The deal was a bit of a head-scratcher, but the famous friends did have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367460914149003271\">one idea</a> that has resonated with Tidal's larger rivals: empowering the artist.</p> <p>This week <strong>Apple</strong> led a $50m investment round in <strong>UnitedMasters</strong>, a US start-up founded by former longtime record executive <strong>Steve Stoute </strong>that helps artists put out music while circumventing the big label system.</p> <p>The topic has become a source of contentious debate after stars including <strong>Taylor Swift</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/deaf2fbf-ab2f-4d1a-b870-7fab104c122f\">have spoken out</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Spotify</strong> has been busy building its own repertoire of talent within the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b38b202-ba3b-49b6-9583-22e99338d3e1\">booming audio space</a>, signing exclusive deals with names including <strong>Barack Obama</strong>, <strong>Prince Harry</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5da51f0e-0d3c-42df-9b29-ec3f714f680f\">and</a> <strong>Meghan Markle</strong>, and most recently acquiring <strong>Clubhouse</strong> competitor <strong>Locker Room</strong>.</p> <p>With 155m subscribers, the Swedish streaming platform holds a massive edge against Apple's 60m and <strong>Amazon Music</strong>'s 55m.
