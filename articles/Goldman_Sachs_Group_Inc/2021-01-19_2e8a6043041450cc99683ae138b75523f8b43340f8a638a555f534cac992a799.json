  "title": "Outlook 2021 (A Special Report) --- Companies Get Ready for New ESG Rules --- Businesses are trying to understand -- and influence -- expected regulatory changes",
  "text": "<p>Jon Hale, head of sustainability research at Morningstar, says any moves by the Biden administration would follow calls from many others seeking environmental, social and governance, or ESG, regulations.</p><p>\"It's not just investors demanding it; all other stakeholders -- workers, customers, clients, the communities you operate in -- they are expecting a higher standard from companies in the way that they operate,\" he says. \"In virtually every industry, there's a unique set of ESG issues that are material to that industry.\"</p><p>Businesses and trade groups have been requesting meetings with Mr. Biden's agency review teams and incoming staff to build relationships, get clarity on expected policies and make pitches for potential rules, according to Biden transition officials, executives and trade groups. So far, the Biden team has been listening and asking questions, the transition officials say.</p><p>One of the biggest areas to be addressed is disclosure. Under the Trump administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission stymied calls for tighter environmental, social and governance rules.</p><p>Currently, public companies must disclose ESG information only if they deem it material to investors' perception of the business. Even though a number of trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have put out voluntary sustainability-disclosure guidelines in recent years, companies often don't disclose ESG data in their financial statements. And the information in voluntary sustainability reports may be inconsistent or incomplete, since companies may report metrics only where they perform well.</p><p>Mr. Biden on Monday named Gary Gensler, a former financial regulator and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive, as his SEC pick. Although Mr. Gensler hasn't outlined his priorities, Mr. Hale expects the SEC to require public companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and greenhouse-gas emissions in their operations and supply chains, since the SEC will have a three-to-two Democratic majority.</p><p>SEC Commissioner Allison Herren Lee, a Democrat, wrote in August that the SEC should \"get investors the standardized, consistent, reliable, and comparable ESG disclosures they need to protect their investments and allocate capital toward a sustainable economy.\"</p><p>\"Companies' disclosure of the potential financial impact of climate change on strategy and operations is still limited,\" says Mary Schapiro, a former SEC chairwoman. \"Markets need high-quality, comparable information from companies to enable informed capital-allocation decisions in the face of climate-related risk.\"</p><p>Other large changes may be in the works. Under the Trump administration, the regulatory environment took what some describe as anti-ESG stances in some rule-making decisions. For instance, the Labor Department completed a rule in October making it more difficult for funds focused on ESG factors to be included in retirement plans.</p><p>Morningstar's Mr. Hale expects the Biden Labor Department to clarify or reverse that rule. Mr. Biden chose Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, who previously led a labor union and the region's Building and Construction Trades Council, as his pick for secretary of labor -- a role that will likely involve dealing with ESG issues around workplace safety amid the continuing pandemic and economic recovery.</p><p>Mr. Biden also named Brian Deese, who led sustainable investing at asset-management giant BlackRock, as his top economic adviser. Mr. Deese, who previously focused on climate change and energy issues as a senior adviser to President Obama, is likely to have influence on ESG-related issues.</p><p>Some companies and trade groups say if the Biden team moves forward on new rules, they would prefer them to be so-called principles-based and tailored to industries rather than uniform regulations.</p><p>For instance, perhaps property and casualty insurers, which are dealing with more frequent storms, would have to consider environmental impact on their business closely, while smaller companies wouldn't have to weigh ESG factors in the same way.</p><p>\"Our belief is a principles-based approach, rather than a one-size-fits-all rules-based approach, is much better,\" says Richard McMahon, senior vice president of energy supply and finance at the Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned electric companies. \"It allows the marketplace to innovate but also to provide information investors are looking for.\"</p><p>Brad Karp, chairman of law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP, says that during a recent virtual meeting with about 1,000 corporate leaders who are clients, the talk focused on Mr. Biden's expected push \"to make ESG real, concrete and hold corporations accountable.\"</p><p>\"It's a virtual certainty that the SEC will follow the European lead and impose enhanced ESG disclosure requirements on public companies,\" he says.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. Glazer is a Wall Street Journal reporter in Los Angeles.
