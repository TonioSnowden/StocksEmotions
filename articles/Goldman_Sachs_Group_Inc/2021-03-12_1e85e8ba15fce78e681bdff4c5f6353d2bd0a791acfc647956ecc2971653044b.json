  "text": "<p>Market Kurly is small compared with the roughly $60 billion valuation for Coupang, whose business extends well beyond groceries. On Thursday, Coupang became the largest foreign company to make its debut in the U.S. since the 2014 share offering of China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Foreign investor interest in both companies reflects the size -- and promise -- of South Korea's e-commerce landscape.</p><p>Ms. Kim, a former Goldman Sachs Inc. analyst, said she tastes every product that might be listed for sale among Market Kurly's curated offerings -- including pet food. She has reviewed about 35,000 items over the past six years; about 15,000 have made the cut. \"Every single thing that we are selling on our platform is something that I would personally buy with my own money,\" Ms. Kim said. \"It's not like customers are just paying us to deliver.\"</p><p>South Korea's affluence, hyperconnectivity and population density have made it a ripe test bed for the future direction of global online shopping. No country has a higher penetration of e-commerce spending, with nearly two-fifths of all purchases occurring online, according to research firm Euromonitor. Of the world's five biggest e-commerce markets, South Korea is projected to grow at the fastest pace this year, expanding 11% to $116 billion, Euromonitor says. That is several percentage points higher than in the U.S., U.K., China and Japan.</p><p>\"If you look at the broader economy and how much of consumption is spent online, Korea is one of the world leaders,\" said John Lindfors, managing partner at DST Global.</p><p>---</p><p>Jaewon Kang contributed to this article.</p>",
