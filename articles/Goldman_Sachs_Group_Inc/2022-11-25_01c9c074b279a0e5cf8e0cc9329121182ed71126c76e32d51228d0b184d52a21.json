  "title": "MANSION --- Private Properties: Alibaba President Sells Two Properties in the Hamptons",
  "text": "<p>The Evanses had been asking a total of $78 million for the properties, which were also being offered separately, for $44.95 million and $39.5 million, according to the multiple listing service. One property sold for $33.75 million, and the other sold for $32.5 million, records show. The identity of the purchasers couldn't be determined.</p><p>Harald Grant of Sotheby's International Realty and Hedgerow Exclusive Properties shared the listing.</p><p>Mr. Grant declined to comment on the identity of the buyers but he said it is rare to find two contiguous lots on the ocean. \"There's not much inventory at all right now,\" he said.</p><p>The Evanses didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>The Evanses purchased the parcels as part of an assemblage they bought from entertainment mogul Robert F.X. Sillerman in several transactions in 2014 and 2016 totaling approximately $114 million. They planned to demolish the existing homes to build a new family compound, but instead listed the property for $150 million in 2017.</p><p>In 2020, they sold one roughly 3-acre parcel for $36 million to David Winter, co-CEO of Standard Industries, according to records and people familiar with the transaction. He sold the property for $48 million in August, records show. Mr. Winter declined to comment.</p><p>Two other parcels remained on the market, Mr. Grant said.</p><p>Mr. Evans spent 20 years as a partner at Goldman Sachs before he was named president of Alibaba in 2015.</p><p>With headwinds in the real-estate market, the number of luxury sales in the Hamptons fell 15% in the third quarter from the same period of the prior year, according to real-estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel. Still, the average luxury sale price in the Hamptons rose 22.7% from last year.</p><p>The Linden Estate, a roughly 9-acre compound in Southampton, recently sold for $70 million, setting a record for a non-waterfront estate. The property had been on and off the market for more than a decade and was most recently listed for $69.95 million at the end of 2021.</p>",
