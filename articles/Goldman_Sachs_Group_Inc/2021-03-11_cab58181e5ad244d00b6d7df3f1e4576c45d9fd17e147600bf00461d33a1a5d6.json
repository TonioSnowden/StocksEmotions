  "text": "<p>Eurozone government bonds gained in price and the region's stock markets closed higher after the European Central Bank pledged to speed up its asset purchases to deal with a jump in global borrowing costs. </p> <p>The yield on Germany's 10-year government bond slipped 0.02 percentage points to minus 0.34 per cent, while Italy's equivalent bond yield fell 0.08 percentage points to 0.6 per cent. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices. </p> <p>The moves came after the ECB said it would tackle a rise in eurozone bond yields by speeding up its sovereign debt purchases under its €1.9tn pandemic emergency purchase programme. European bond yields have for months been propelled higher as US Treasuries sold off in anticipation of a jolt in inflation.</p> <p>“The ECB Governing Council indicated discomfort with the recent increase in long-term yields given its pledge to keep financing conditions favourable,” said Sven Jari Stehn, an economist at Goldman Sachs, adding that he expects the ECB to increase its bond purchases to around €20bn per week from roughly €12bn recently. </p> <p>The regional Stoxx Europe 600 benchmark closed up 0.5 per cent to 424 points, putting it within touching distance of its pre-pandemic high of 433.9 reached last February. </p> <p>The ECB's signalling on Thursday was in response to fears that rising bond yields would feed through to higher borrowing costs in eurozone nations where the rollout of coronavirus vaccines has been delayed and economies are expected to take longer to recover than the US. </p> <p>“The outlook for the eurozone economy is much weaker than that of the US because of the slower pace of coronavirus vaccine rollouts and the contrast in fiscal stimulus,” said Juliette Cohen, strategist at Paris-based CPR Asset Management, referring to US president Joe Biden's $1.9tn coronavirus relief package. </p> <p>“Europe still needs monetary support and the recent hike in eurozone bond yields was unjustified,” said Cohen. </p> <p>Following the announcement, the spreads between German and Italian 10-year debt — seen as a measure of political risk in the eurozone — also tightened to 0.94 percentage points, down from 0.99 percentage points earlier in the day.&#xa0;</p> <p>Inflation in the eurozone was expected to reach 1.5 per cent this year, the ECB president Christine Lagarde <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pressconf/2021/html/ecb.is210311~d368d7151a.en.html\">said</a>, up from the bank's earlier projection of 1 per cent. But this was because of “transitory factors” such as higher energy prices while consumer demand remained weak and the labour market was “slack”, added Lagarde. </p> <p>One beneficiary of the slide in eurozone yields would be US government debt because that offered more income, said Philipp Burckhardt, fixed-income strategist at Lombard Odier. “The thinking is that if Europe commits to very low yields for a long time, US Treasuries are more attractive so lets switch some money into them.”</p><p>Source: Naomi Rovnick and Joshua Oliver 2021 'European bonds rally after ECB pledges to step up asset purchases' FT.com 11 March.
