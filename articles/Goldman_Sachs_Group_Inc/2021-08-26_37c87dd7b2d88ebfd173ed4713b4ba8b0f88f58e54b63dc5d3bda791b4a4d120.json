  "text": "<p>Mr. Moynihan is shuffling leadership at the second-largest bank in the U.S. after more than a decade at the helm. Many of his top executives have served long tenures, and, in recent years, he has been under pressure to make room for fresh blood. The bank said it would announce a succession plan in the coming weeks.</p><p>Both executives have large presences inside the bank, having worked there during the financial crisis of 2008-09 and through the bank's slow recovery in the aftermath. Bank of America and its peers proved much more resilient when the coronavirus pandemic shut down businesses across the country and put millions of Americans out of work.</p><p>Mr. Montag left Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to join Merilll Lynch before it was acquired by Bank of America in the financial crisis.</p><p>Ms. Finucane worked alongside Mr. Moynihan at Fleet Bank before it was acquired by Bank of America in 2004 and served as chief marketing officer when the bank sought to rebrand itself after the financial crisis. More recently, she has been focused on sustainable investing and the bank's European division.</p><p>Write to Ben Eisen at ben.eisen@wsj.com</p><p>Bank of America Says Two Top Executives to Retire</p>",
