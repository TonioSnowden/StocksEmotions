  "title": "The media is really missing Trump",
  "text": "<p>The Washington Post's motto, “Democracy dies in darkness”, has served it very well over the past four years. The newspaper tripled its subscriber base during Donald Trump's presidency (fuelled by excellent reporting, I should stress). The post-Trump era is a different ballgame. As the Post itself reports, its <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/media-trump-bump-slump/2021/03/22/5f13549a-85d1-11eb-bfdf-4d36dab83a6d_story.html\">online traffic fell</a> by 26 per cent between January and February this year. The New York Times saw a 17 per cent drop in hits. </p> <p>“Democracy chugs along reasonably well in moderate daylight” is not quite so good for sales. As you might expect, the trends are even more vertiginous for the cable news channels. CNN lost 45 per cent of its primetime audience since Joe Biden was inaugurated. Among the other outlets, Fox News was the least badly hit since it has taken to confecting outrage against the Biden administration. Everyone else is suffering an outrage drought. For very different reasons — notably a more professional-based readership — the Financial Times is also an outlier. The FT's America traffic did not fall between January and February.&#xa0;</p> <p>So how will the media survive in this post-Trump climate? The answer, alas, lies ultimately with the consumer. As the old saying goes, “if it bleeds it leads”. That instinct has always been true of tabloids and a lot of television news. In the age of social media, that consumer bias has metastasised beyond our worst nightmares. Numerous studies show that Facebook and Twitter thrive on negative news and wither when it is benign. The darker and more sinister the link, the likelier it is to be shared by users. Preferably it should be ad hominem. As both an originator and a target of such links, Trump has personified this business model. We should be careful what we wish for. He, or someone worse, may yet provide the media with another short-term boom. In the meantime, expect the news to look almost as bleak even when it isn't.&#xa0;</p> <p>The New York Times' David Leonhardt gives a distressing example of this in a study of the media's <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/briefing/boulder-shooting-george-segal-astrazeneca.html\">negative bias</a> in its coverage of Covid. In short, the media leaps on pandemic bad news and sidelines the good news. Thus, stories about people getting infected after having been vaccinated are highlighted even if it is extremely rare; one study found that of 36,600 fully vaccinated healthcare workers, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/health-care-workers-infected-covid-full-vaccination-study/story?id=76651640\">less than 1 per cent tested positive for Covid-19</a>. </p> <p>AstraZeneca's very rare blood clots are another case in point. Of course, it's the media's job to highlight problems and hold power to account, whether corporate or political. But the net effect is to give a misleading picture of where we are headed, which is mostly positive. It also tends to validate the positions of the many people out there who are mistrustful of science. The same of course could be said of crime coverage, which generally makes people far more paranoid than they should be. In practice, no amount of skewed pandemic coverage, or hyped crime reporting, is likely to fill the Trump-shaped hole in media revenues. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Is there a solution? I wish I had a simple answer. It would be nice if the public was converted en masse to serious journalism. But that's like expecting the movie box office to shift to French art house. It will never happen. It is slightly more realistic to hope that Facebook et al will be forced into more equitable revenue sharing with the media. Such platforms are a huge part of the problem. Australia may have made a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/360b0419-83b4-4bcb-b7a3-495be92723fc\">good start</a> on this. Overall, though, I am bereft of good answers. </p> <p>Brooke, as an infinitely better analyst of the corporate and financial world than me, what do you suggest? You're not allowed to say “subscribe to the FT”, which, as you know, Swampians already do.</p> <h2>Recommended reading&#xa0;</h2> <ul>  <li><p>My column this week warns against<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f5845e7-2e10-4f22-916f-c1c970131d34\"> America's growing fixation with race</a>. “No side ever wins in an endless feud. The only beneficiaries are the elites directing events far away from most people's reality.”</p></li>  <li><p>Brooke, I fully agree with the tilt in your latest column on how Goldman Sachs shows that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19a14cad-b5fc-4fc3-aa5a-ca306af5b831\">long hours and Covid don't mix</a>.

Such a concert would include both China and Russia. Their neorealist solution to global instability sparked an impassioned debate among a few of my colleagues. I won't tell you who said what. But people felt strongly one way or the other (I'm agnostic).&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Brooke Masters responds</h2> <p>Ed, I share your concern that&#xa0;the search for profits has led the media down the path toward polarisation and negativity.&#xa0;</p> <p>I think it has been exacerbated by the decline in local advertising. Big local retailers and employers have a stake in seeing their community portrayed positively. That can be problematic when they try to suppress scandals or bad news, but it also provides a natural constituency for good news. I find it disheartening&#xa0;that the board of Tribune Publishing (owner of the Baltimore Sun and Chicago Tribune) has&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/24/business/media/tribune-alden-global-bainum.html\">backed a bid</a>&#xa0;from Alden Global, which has been accused of shrinking newsrooms, over one from a Maryland hotel magnate.</p> <p>There's also another threat on the horizon. US appeals court judge&#xa0;Laurence Silberman has<a href=\"https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/C5F7840A6FFFCF648525869D004ECAC5/$file/19-7132-1890626.pdf\">&#xa0;urged the Supreme Court</a>&#xa0;to rethink the landmark 1964 decision&#xa0;that protects American media from most libel claims. He thinks most outlets are too liberal and are contributing to “a frighteningly orthodox media culture”. Not only is this at odds with the Fox News statistics that you just quoted, but any steps in this direction would make it even harder for the press to do its main job of holding the powerful to account. J Michael Luttig, himself a former Republican appeals court judge, has a&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/03/25/federal-judges-dangerous-assault-free-press/\">good piece</a>&#xa0;explaining why Silberman's ideas are so terrible.</p> <p><em>Rana Foroohar is on book leave and will return in mid-April</em></p> <h1>Your feedback</h1> <p><strong>And now a word from our Swampians . . . </strong></p> <p><strong>In response to ‘</strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47338047-8d81-4854-a556-084d7c7eb07c\"><strong>Joe Biden: the view from Europe</strong></a><strong>':</strong></p> <p>“Calling a state leader a killer is not a way to build a relationship. What did Biden expect to gain by such an answer? Some US hawks might approve,&#xa0;but for a European bordering on Russia it is less comforting.
