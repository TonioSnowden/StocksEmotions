  "text": "<p>A large group of senior Wall Street executives, including David Solomon of Goldman Sachs and Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, have backed Joe Biden's $1.9tn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fd96a32-da98-4f31-8936-8f3699200652\">stimulus plan</a> ahead of this week's crucial votes on the package in Congress. </p> <p>In a letter to congressional leaders from both parties yesterday, more than 150 business leaders based in New York City called for “immediate and large-scale federal legislation” to tackle the fallout from the pandemic. </p> <p>“Previous federal relief measures have been essential, but more must be done to put the country on a trajectory for a strong, durable recovery,” they wrote. </p> <p>The support for Biden's plan from some of the top names in the US financial sector — who also include Larry Fink of BlackRock and Ken Jacobs of Lazard — comes despite strong opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill who believe the level of new spending is excessive. </p> <p>Meanwhile Jay Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, has switched to a more <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/0dd48851-f442-4e3e-a068-532dd9f05137\">neutral stance</a> on fiscal support after vocally advocating it last year. During two days of questioning from lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week, Powell repeatedly refused to take a position on Biden's stimulus package — though he dismissed concerns that it might lead to an unwanted jump in inflation this year.</p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p>The<strong> US FDA </strong>confirmed Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-shot vaccine was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/abea44bf-e6cb-415f-8aee-1487803e154c\">safe and effective</a>.

The vote means McKinsey's next chief will be either Bob Sternfels or Sven Smit. (FT)</p> <p><strong>Xi asserts success of China's anti-poverty drive</strong> Chinese president Xi Jinping has claimed personal responsibility for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b459efb3-9377-4624-ab7b-33fdbc255e31\">eradicating poverty</a> in China. The statement, made during a ceremony in Beijing, marks Xi's attempt to assert his position as one of the country's epoch-defining leaders, ahead of the centenary of the founding of the Chinese Communist party in July. (FT) </p> <p><strong>Anglo American cautious on higher commodity prices</strong> Anglo American chief executive Mark Cutifani said the global miner would not be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fd5b11d-fac6-47e9-9b24-9bd4fbdccf8f\">“seduced” by rising commodity prices</a> and splurge cash on deals or new projects after reporting its highest second-half profit since 2011.

UK government officials note Biden has proposed an increase in corporate tax rates from 21 per cent to 28 per cent — a move that would give Sunak greater scope to push the UK rate up from its current 19 per cent.

Joe Manchin, the senior senator from West Virginia, is the most conservative member of his caucus and has a propensity to cross party lines — making him a figure to court in a Senate that the Democrats hold by the narrowest of margins.</p> <p><strong>How the pandemic alters everything</strong> Are we at one of those hinge points in history, like the Great Depression, where the citizenry's political preferences turn in a new direction? To date, we have mostly had to make do with speculation, but two new surveys suggest that there is indeed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc3ccf99-19d9-42e5-9470-9a2424316158\">big change under way</a> in attitudes.</p> <p><strong>What can we learn from those at the top? </strong>In an uncertain climate, the FT is convening a panel of diverse global leaders to offer insights into their <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/f7c475bb-448c-46b8-bcef-8d233c1ae07a\">pandemic successes, failures and future plans</a>.
