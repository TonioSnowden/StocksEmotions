  "text": "<p>Mayor Eric Adams is urging JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon and other New York City business leaders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0fcbada-bc73-41b8-aa6b-ff81d7fe1e0c\">to ride the subway to work</a> as he intensifies a campaign to bring employees back to Manhattan's empty offices.</p> <p>“We're telling our corporate leaders: ‘Hey, get on the train!'” Adams said in an interview with the Financial Times. “We need to advertise that New York is back.”</p> <p>Only about 40 per cent of workers have returned to New York City offices in spite of repeated exhortations from the mayor, posing a dire threat to the city's economic livelihood.</p> <p>Surveys conducted by the Partnership for New York City, a leading employers' group, have found that fear of a crime-plagued subway is the overwhelming obstacle preventing workers from returning.</p> <p>The mayor's public relations campaign is trying to convince leaders such as Dimon, the JPMorgan chief executive, and his counterparts at Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and others to ditch their customary black cars and ride the train instead.</p> <p>“We're going to get him on the train,” he said of Dimon. “We're going to get everyone on the train. He understands the need of getting his people back and leading from the front.”</p> <p>JPMorgan declined to comment.</p> <p><em>Do you work in New York City? Are you commuting into the office? Would you catch the subway? Email me at</em><a href=\"mailto:firstft@ft.com\"><em> firstft@ft.com</em></a><em>. Here's the rest of today's news — Gordon</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Musk casts fresh doubt on $44bn Twitter takeover</strong> In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06f2d779-37da-488d-8d63-e069e3deaea6#post-59036388-7442-4514-bfea-d93c16b0caae\">a series of tweets</a> the billionaire said that his takeover of Twitter could not move ahead until chief executive Parag Agrawal provided more data about fake accounts on the social media platform. Yesterday Musk acknowledged the agreed purchase might fall through and that a lower price was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2baac8e5-48ce-4aa3-a908-0ee2d5693c84\">“not out of the question”</a>. Twitter shares closed down more than 8 per cent on Monday at $37.39, more than a third below the offer price of $54.20.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Rescue under way</strong> <strong>to save trapped Ukrainian fighters</strong> An operation to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79f3a398-ed1a-4232-ad3e-b0cc3997e86c\">free Ukrainian fighters</a> from the besieged Azovstal steelplant in Mariupol is under way, with the agreement of Russian forces. The breakthrough comes a day after Vladimir Putin indicated <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3f29756-06e1-443d-8364-bd98c7cd19d4\">Russia would tolerate</a> Finland and Sweden joining Nato. Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, however, objected to the nations' applications.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Jeff Bezos turns up the heat on Joe Biden</strong> The Amazon founder lashed out at the White House yesterday over policies he claimed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ef4934e-2072-4534-bce6-824fb0da8628\">were stoking inflation</a>. The world's third-richest person took aim at the failed Build Back Better bill which would have increased taxes on the wealthy and large companies to pay for spending on childcare, education and programmes to curb climate change.</p> <p><strong>4. Investors pull $7bn from Tether as stablecoin jitters intensify</strong> Traders have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db9c3f32-cd91-4149-9788-95b2046bea10\">yanked $7bn from Tether</a>, cutting its market value by about 9 per cent since the world's biggest stablecoin briefly lost its peg against the US dollar, intensifying concerns about the assets that underpin the global cryptocurrency market. </p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>US eases Cuba policy to allow more travel and remittances</strong> The Biden administration said it will aim <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16142e35-0a50-4d06-810b-c962cf296533\">to issue 20,000 visas under a family reunification programme</a> for Cubans, permit more commercial flights for group educational trips and lift a $1,000 limit on quarterly remittances. The change of policy represents a marked softening from former president Donald Trump's harder line against the communist government in Havana.</p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>Primary voters cast ballots</strong> It is the biggest day of voting so far this year, with Democratic and Republican party members in Idaho, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oregon and Pennsylvania casting ballots in primary races. Kathy Barnette, the ultra-conservative, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae345fe9-f753-479b-bf15-c8d86034533f\">surged in the polls in the closely watched contest in Pennsylvania</a> for her anti-abortion position.</p> <p><strong>Monetary policy</strong> Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell is set to discuss the central bank's plan for taming inflation during a discussion at the <a href=\"https://foefestival.wsj.com/event/the-future-of-everything-festival/\">Wall Street Journal's Future of Everything conference</a>. Chicago Fed president Charles Evans, Cleveland Fed president Loretta Mester, Philadelphia Fed president Patrick Harker and St Louis Fed president James Bullard are also variously scheduled to speak today.</p> <p><strong>Economic data </strong>Retail sales are expected to have increased 0.9 per cent in April, up from a 0.5 per cent gain in March. Sales in the so-called control group, which excludes autos, petrol, building materials and food services, is forecast to have jumped 0.5 per cent last month. The National Association of Home Builders' housing market index is expected to have declined to 75 points in May from April's reading of 77, according to economists polled by Refinitiv.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Corporate earnings </strong>Retailers Walmart and Home Depot will be closely watched by investors for any comments on inflation and supply chain bottlenecks. Analysts expect earnings at both companies to fall compared with the same period last year when supermarkets and homeware retailers saw a surge in sales linked to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p><em>Join us in person or online at the </em><a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/6ES-sLCULsHTIvx3N2GPGA~~/AAAAAQA~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~~\"><em>FT Business of Luxury Summit</em></a><em> on May&#xa0;18-20 to hear from luxury leaders including British Vogue, Valentino, Zegna and YSL.</em></p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>Dollar's rise increases risks for global economy</strong> With so much going on in the global economy and financial markets, the US dollar's recent appreciation has attracted less attention than expected, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/099cf547-9081-488b-87c3-5bf66c18843f\">writes Mohamed El-Erian</a>. But there are dangers in the dollar's rise, he says, especially for developing countries.</p> <p><strong>Boeing customers fear company has ‘lost its way'</strong> After the last time Boeing moved its headquarters — from Seattle to Chicago in 2001 — critics said executives became more focused on wooing Wall Street than engineering excellence. Two decades on stakeholders are again <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9df9d699-f49b-4151-8c4f-36cc488b17ac\">debating the wisdom</a> of moving the aerospace company's headquarters.</p> <p><strong>NBA extends global reach with international stars</strong> Nikola Jokić of Serbia last week became the fourth foreign-born player to win the US National Basketball Association's most valuable player award. The success of international players is the result of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fd18384e-097c-4b35-adef-1183d931df8d\">multi-decade effort</a> by US sports to build fan bases abroad.</p> <p><strong>Food insecurity is a bigger crisis than energy </strong>Governments are spending a lot of time and resources trying to mitigate the soaring cost of energy following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But Megan Greene warns that the war has sown the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17d7e07f-46c6-4c41-9202-e445928a405a\">seeds of an even bigger crisis</a>: a global food shortage.</p> <p><strong>Deutsche Bank looks to escape decade of scandal and strife</strong> The incoming chief of Germany's largest bank is likely to face a bruising, years-long battle to create a European banking champion that can compete with US heavyweights. But some shareholders are already questioning <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06158598-daa0-4560-b072-a57bcbd7697c\">whether Alex Wynaendts is the right person for the job</a>.</p> <h1>Travel</h1> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10182638-300c-42ec-898d-e96ce4c4f257\">King's Highway in Jordan</a> is one of the world's oldest, most chequered and most romantic roads, as legendary and evocative as the Silk Road.
