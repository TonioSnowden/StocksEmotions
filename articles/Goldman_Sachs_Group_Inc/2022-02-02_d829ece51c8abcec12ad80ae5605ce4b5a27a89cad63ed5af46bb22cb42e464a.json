  "text": "<p>Foreign selling of Indian equities has reached the highest level since the global financial crisis, batting down valuations of top stocks as Narendra Modi's government plans to use the listing of a state-run insurer to plug holes in the national budget.</p> <p>The net sale of $4.5bn worth of equities in January alone marked the biggest monthly divestment since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and came as India's Sensex reversed most of the initial gains that had made it one of the best-performing major indices in early 2022.</p> <p>Investors said geopolitical uncertainty and tightening from central banks had accelerated foreign outflows. “The Ukraine crisis and impending Fed rate hikes have made the more opportunistic global investors nervous, triggering a risk-off move,” said Praveen Jagwani, chief executive of UTI International, an Indian asset manager.</p> <p>The January sell-off marked the fourth straight month that global investors cashed out of Indian equities and brought net sales for the period to $9.3bn. That amount is close to the record $9.9bn dumped over a seven-month run during the global financial crisis, according to a Financial Times analysis of data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India.</p> <p>Fund managers and analysts said much of the selling stemmed from investors closing positions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0009581-7b1e-42d1-b248-c9b4e89279df\">staked out during a rally</a> that pushed the Sensex 22 per cent higher last year.</p> <p>“What is driving the sell-off is more profit-taking than anything else,” said Jayesh Gandhi, head of offshore and portfolio management services at BNP Paribas Asset Management India. “Investors bought heavily into India in 2020 and 2021, and now they're taking some money off the table.”</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Sensex received a boost of more than 1 per cent from the announcement of India's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0a6cf20-c4c0-43a0-a717-010167dbf1e7\">annual budget</a>. Investors are expected to watch market sentiment closely as Modi's government pursues a listing for the state-run Life Insurance Corporation of India to trim the projected deficit for the 12 months starting in April of 6.4 per cent. </p> <p>Vasudev Jagannath, an equities analyst at IIFL Securities in Mumbai, said domestic traders were focused on the budget and upcoming elections in four big states starting later this month, both of which would set the tone for Indian markets this quarter.</p> <p>“These are important macro events that investors are watching and they will definitely have a bearing on sentiment for any IPO that comes through,” he said. </p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b18390a7-10e9-4068-8de3-eb2e59012838\">timing of the LIC listing</a> is vital because New Delhi is anticipating that the share sale will contribute to its spending plans for the coming year, which starts in April. An official valuation will only be available in LIC's prospectus but the government has previously estimated the company's value at up to $203bn.</p> <p>“They need to offer 5 per cent of shares at a minimum but beyond that it has yet to be decided,” said a banker at one of 10 banks on the deal, which include Goldman Sachs, Citi and Bank of America.</p> <p>The banker added that there had been “no discussion” of either pricing or deal size, but based on the government's previous estimate a 5 per cent stake sale would raise more than $10.2bn, four times the $2.5bn brought in by financial technology company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81d2e1a7-d2c5-43e9-9835-fcd3ce375c6e\">Paytm in November</a>. </p> <p>The banker expected the IPO, which will make LIC one of India's largest companies by market capitalisation, to be carried out this quarter. Despite continued selling by foreign investors, India's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50db7615-7106-458a-8887-59974ab80cb6\">legion of retail traders</a> are expected to turn out in full force for the year's biggest flotations.</p> <p>“Appetite for Indian equities among domestic investors is still very strong,” said Gandhi at BNP Paribas. “Real interest rates are negative in India, that is a reason why retail investors are looking to equities.”</p><p>Source: Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong and Chloe Cornish in Mumbai 2022 'Indian stocks suffer worst foreign outflows since global financial crisis' FT.com 2 February.
