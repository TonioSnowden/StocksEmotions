  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  GameStop Bet Dings Melvin Capital's Shine  ----  By Juliet Chung",
  "text": "<p>   Melvin Capital Management is down 15% just three weeks into 2021, thanks to a series of wrong-way bets that stocks including GameStop Corp. would slump. </p><p>   Founded by 42-year-old Gabe Plotkin, a former star portfolio manager for hedge-fund titan Steven A. Cohen, Melvin bets on and against stocks and managed about $12.5 billion at the start of the year. Its short book, or array of bets against companies, has driven losses so far this year, said people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Melvin's losses were broad-based and not driven by losses on GameStop or any other specific stock, some of them said. </p><p>   The stumble by one of the best-performing hedge funds in recent years underscores the heavy losses being suffered by short sellers at a time when major indexes have soared to records. The market is as exuberant as many traders and portfolio managers say they have seen since the tech bust 20 years ago. </p><p>   Many investors have complained about short squeezes that have left them nursing losses. In a short squeeze, heavy buying forces short bettors to buy back shares to limit their losses. </p><p>   A sign of the pain short-sellers are experiencing: Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s basket of the 50 stocks with the highest short interest as a share of market capitalization was up a total 25% for the year through Friday, compared with a total-return of 2.4% by the S&amp;P 500. </p><p>   Many hedge funds have simply gotten out of the way as markets have surged since March on the back of low interest rates and massive fiscal stimulus. A Nov. 19 Goldman report said the outstanding short interest in the median S&amp;P 500 stock equaled just 1.6% of its market capitalization, \"the lowest level in our 16-year data history.\" </p><p>   In contrast, Melvin is known for running an expansive and aggressive short book that has sometimes made up the bulk of the fund's gains, an uncommon dynamic in the industry. The firm has returned an average 30% a year since it started in 2014, despite charging performance fees that range up to 30% on investment gains. </p><p>   A double-digit loss so early in the year creates a large hole Melvin will need to climb out of before it can start charging performance fees. </p><p>   One stock that has dinged Melvin and significantly hurt New York hedge fund Maple-lane Capital, which is also down for the year, is videogame retailer GameStop. </p><p>   GameStop's stock has soared 245% this year through Friday. It closed Friday at $65.01, up 51% from Thursday. </p><p>   Analysts said previously that GameStop's rapid gains were partly spurred by an announced deal to add Chewy Inc. co-founder Ryan Cohen to its board. Mr. Cohen, who has been building a stake in GameStop, has urged the company to shift away from its bricks-and-mortar focus. </p><p>   But members of Reddit's popular WallStreetBets forum, who have been touting the stock and noting its substantial short interest, have taken victory laps as shares surged, The Wall Street Journal reported. </p><p>   Some of the posts specifically call out Melvin, which disclosed in its most recent quarterly regulatory filing that it held put options on GameStop. Put options are contracts that give investors the right to sell stock at a specific price by a certain date and limit an investor's potential losses. </p><p>   A person familiar with Melvin said its GameStop puts expired last week. </p><p>   Fund managers say the influx of millions of new individual investors into markets last year has distorted some stock prices. Individual investors have drawn notice for their use of short-dated options that magnify their clout. </p><p>   The relative outperformance this year of small- and midcap stocks, compared with megacap tech stocks that have been favored by hedge funds, also has hurt -- making gains from funds' long bets less likely to mitigate their losses from shorts. </p><p>   In recent days, Mr. Plotkin has been calling clients with chief operating officer David Kurd to inform them of and explain the losses thus far. One client said Melvin's message was that the fund still liked its portfolio and that it had rebounded from past losses. </p><p>   Melvin expects to take in more than $1 billion in February, people familiar with its plans said. Clients can only get all of their money out of Melvin in three years' time, meaning Melvin typically can expect to ride out market turbulence. </p><p>   One client said he wasn't worried about Melvin's troubles given Mr. Plotkin's record. Mr. Plotkin's buys of big slugs of retailer L Brands Inc., Expedia Group and Hyatt Hotels Corp. in March captured other traders' attention last year. The share prices have all since climbed. </p><p></p>",
