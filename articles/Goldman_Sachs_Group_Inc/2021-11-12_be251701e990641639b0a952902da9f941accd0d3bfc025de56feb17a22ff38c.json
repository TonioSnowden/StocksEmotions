  "text": "<p>Most signs point to hiring difficulties only getting more intense. Last week's job report showed that the labor-force participation rate—the share of the working-age population either employed or actively seeking employment—was unchanged from the prior month at 61.6% in October, which compared with 63.3% before the Covid-19 crisis struck. That is a sign that many of the people who moved to the sidelines are staying there. Further, as of last week, there were nearly 5% more job openings than at the end of September, according to job search site Indeed. And then there are all the other signs of tightness, such as employers offering hiring bonuses, and dropping education and experience requirements.</p><p>Back in the summer, there was an expectation that things would be easing up by now. Some people thought the expiration of expanded unemployment benefits in the states that were still offering them would set more people looking for work. Others focused on how the start of a somewhat normal school year, with most students back in classrooms, would alleviate child-care issues and allow more people to re-enter the workforce.</p><p>Now the goal posts have moved. Child-care issues are still a problem, especially for families with younger children, and that might be keeping some people from work. Multiple rounds of government relief have given a boost to many Americans' savings, and that might be slowing some people's re-entry into the labor market.</p><p>The broader concern now is that even if child care gets easier and savings diminish, many people might never go back to work. Goldman Sachs economists point out 3.4 million of the 5 million who have exited the labor market since the pandemic are 55 or older, and many of them may have effectively retired. This opens up the possibility that the job market isn't just temporarily tight. That, in combination with the move up in inflation, would give the Federal Reserve ample reason to raise rates.</p><p>But before making too many assumptions about how lasting hiring problems might be, it is important to remember (as if one could forget) that there is still a pandemic going on. Until Covid-19 is under control, and people are no longer fretful about going into work, it is hard to make assumptions about whether or not the job market has permanently tightened.</p><p>Labor Market Has No Slack in Sight</p>",
