  "title": "Mizuho Americas to Acquire Placement Agent Capstone Partners; The deal is expected to be announced imminently, sources say",
  "text": "<p>Founded in 2001, Dallas-based Capstone provides placement services for investment firms pitching funds in sectors that include private equity, credit, real estate and infrastructure.</p><p>Managers that have enlisted Capstone to help with their fundraising efforts include sports-focused growth investor Arctos Sports Partners, which collected more than $2.1 billion for its debut fund Arctos Sports Partners I LP. Other firms that have tapped Capstone to place their funds are U.S. lower midmarket-focused Align Capital Partners, healthcare-focused Amulet Capital Partners, natural resources investor Atlas Holdings, Italian infrastructure firm F2i and secondary investor Whitehorse Liquidity Partners, according to Capstone's website.</p><p>The Capstone acquisition will help Mizuho Americas build out its advisory capabilities in alternative assets, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Capstone has some 40 professionals working across Dallas and New York in the U.S.; London and Geneva in Europe; and Singapore in Asia.</p><p>More asset managers and financial institutions have set up their own private-markets advisory teams, as investors pump additional capital into alternative assets, driving record or near-record deal volume. Some of these institutions are poaching talent from established firms or even by acquiring small boutique shops outright. They include financial institutions Jefferies &amp; Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Raymond James Financial Inc., Moelis &amp; Co., Rothschild &amp; Co. and PNC Financial Services Group Inc.</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com</p>",
