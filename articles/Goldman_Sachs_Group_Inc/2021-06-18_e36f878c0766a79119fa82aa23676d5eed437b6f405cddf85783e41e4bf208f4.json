  "title": "JPMorgan Buys Nutmeg in U.K. Digital Push",
  "text": "<p>JPMorgan said in January it would launch a new digital bank in the U.K., offering consumer banking services there for the first time. Called Chase, it is currently being tested internally with JPMorgan employees ahead of a public launch later this year. Nutmeg's savings and investment products won't initially be offered through the retail banking project, the bank said.</p><p>JPMorgan is entering a crowded digital banking marketplace in the U.K. Regulators encouraged new startups, including Starling Bank Ltd. and Monzo Bank Ltd., to boost competition in the wake of the last global financial crisis. These so-called challenger banks have forced traditional lenders to improve their digital offerings but have struggled to earn profits.</p><p>JPMorgan last year considered making a bid for Starling Bank, founded by Anne Boden in 2014, according to people familiar with the situation.</p><p>JPMorgan previously tried to launch a digital bank in U.S. cities and markets where it didn't have Chase branches, but closed the product, called Finn, in June 2019 after slow pickup. Bank executives have said they learned lessons from that program, including that the Chase brand resonated better than a new name.</p><p>Nutmeg aims to make wealth management more accessible through the internet, Neil Alexander, the company's chief executive, said in a statement. Nutmeg was chosen as a name because the spice, like wealth and investment services, was once rare and costly but is now widely available.</p><p>Like other investment sites, it sells access to funds, ETFs and pensions. Nutmeg appeals to investment novices, avoids jargon and provides tools and Q&amp;As about the ins and outs of the finance world.</p><p>The company's revenue grew 29% in 2019 to GBP 9.3 million from the previous year, and its loss increased 15% to GBP 21.2 million. Its shareholders, who will be bought out in the deal, include Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Schroders PLC, the U.K. asset manager.</p>",
