  "text": "<p>Good morning. Today, we will almost certainly get a hot inflation print. The expectation is for a somewhat lower headline figure, thanks in part to cheaper petrol. That's plausible, but after the shocker jobs report last week, who knows. This economy has a nasty habit of reminding us how little we understand. If you've got it all figured out, email us: ethan.wu@ft.com and katie.martin@ft.com.</p> <h1>Will the IRA affect markets?</h1> <p>I have no idea whether the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed the Senate on Sunday, will reduce or inflame inflation (maybe neither?). But the last-minute wrangling over how to fund the bill has produced some interesting market-relevant policy. After plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/64305c91-c7aa-427b-adb9-7a32d74d3490\">tax carried interest</a> collapsed, Democrats swapped in a 1 per cent tax on stock buybacks. There is also a new minimum tax on corporations' publicly reported book income. How big a deal is this?</p> <p>Senators Ron Wyden and Sherrod Brown, who were pushing a 2 per cent buybacks tax just last year, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SenSherrodBrown/status/1557017545445478400\">think</a> it's a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2010/mar/23/joe-biden-obama-big-fucking-deal-overheard\">BFD</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>For years, Wall Street has used massive stock buybacks to enrich themselves instead of investing in workers, innovation, and American jobs.</p>  <p>We're excited to announce that the Senate has passed our bill to tax stock buybacks, finally making Wall Street pay their fair share.</p> </blockquote> <p>We've <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e124ccc-01f3-454a-b64d-3b648006a2df\">argued</a> before that Wyden and Brown tell an incomplete story. Companies don't have an unlimited slate of above-hurdle rate investment opportunities, and sinking cash into a bad project just destroys shareholder value. Stock buybacks are a flexible way to return cash to shareholders when better uses aren't available. Even Warren Buffett has become comfortable opening the buyback taps, repurchasing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c703b53f-2b04-4fe5-aa7f-b18c5e3e95bb\">$52bn</a> in Berkshire shares in 2020-21 when richly valued markets left him with few good alternatives. (Caveats abound, as we <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e2b9cf7-4c48-4a68-868a-a75f39ecbaa6\">discussed last year</a>.)</p> <p>Though Wyden/Brown have now won the political argument, Wall Street isn't all that alarmed. Politico <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/05/sinema-excise-tax-schumer-00050132\">reports</a> that business lobbyists have mostly shrugged. On the margin, the buybacks tax may push firms to favour dividends — but a 1 per cent rate is just not very high. Another factor dampening the tax's impact: it nets out freshly issued shares, including stock-based compensation, Mark Hackett of Nationwide Investment Research pointed out to me. One likely impact, he thinks, is a rush of buybacks this year before the law takes effect, which may boost share prices.</p> <p>The buybacks tax will still clip earnings. Combined with the new minimum corporate tax, Goldman Sachs reckons S&amp;P 500 earnings per share will be 1.5 per cent lower in 2023, compared to previous estimates. Here's a handy table from Bank of America offering a similar outlook. Note that growthy sectors such as tech and communication services, which often pay lower effective corporate tax rates, are facing the biggest earnings hit:</p> <p>On the other side of the ledger, the IRA's taxes will fund nearly $370bn in new spending, offsetting lighter corporate earnings with higher demand. Put together, Goldman estimates that the net fiscal impact will be small but negative:</p> <p>Lowering GDP by a fraction of a percentage point next year is pretty minor. The timing, however, could matter to markets, if the hit to earnings starts biting just as a slowdown is accelerating. </p> <p>Activity has already started cooling as the Federal Reserve tightens policy. And the effects of rising rates and slowing growth are already showing up in markets. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50baba43-f182-40b1-8ae7-0cb8fbaa2f0c\">IPO funding</a> has dried up. Debt deals are being <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-01/companies-are-scrapping-bond-sales-at-the-fastest-pace-in-years\">put off</a>. That's with the fed funds rate at 2.3 per cent; markets expect rates to peak around 3.7 per cent next March. Now, with monetary policy growing more restrictive, Congress is throwing some mildly contractionary fiscal policy on top. Perhaps that helps reduce inflation but, equally, it risks piling on to an economy that is already stumbling.</p> <h1>Meme stocks' mini moment</h1> <p>For a brief, shining moment on Monday meme-stock mania was back. At one point, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond had shot up 40 per cent during record trading volume. AMC and GameStop were bouncing right along with it, earning quotes in the press like <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-08/bed-bath-beyond-jump-brings-some-meme-frenzy-to-broad-rally\">this</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>The “smart guys” are “confused, baffled and fighting short positions from a position of weakness in terms of momentum and firepower,” said Mark Taylor, a sales trader at Mirabaud Securities. “The lack of real understanding of why a sudden resurrection of the meme-entum bid could lead to some nefarious speculation about things being manipulated but what would be as much sour grapes speculation as anything real.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Tuesday didn't bring the same bump, with all the major meme stocks sinking. But even so, the last few months haven't looked so bad in meme-land:</p> <p>Is this a surprise? Risk appetite has crept back into markets over the past few months, culminating in one of the best months of all time in July, as Katie noted in a recent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/996c3b02-f899-4c28-b670-82d46ad18746\">column</a>. Maybe retail speculators are tired of being scared and are ready to get back to the honest work of squeezing shorts.</p> <p>What's odd, though, is that other speculative stuff has not followed suit. Ark Innovation ETF, a basket of long-shot tech stocks, and an index of listed penny stocks have risen alongside the broader market, but nothing like GameStop or AMC:</p> <p>Crypto has regained ground since crashing in June, but unlike meme stocks, volumes are not rising much. By crypto standards, price charts look more like gradual recovery than euphoric rally:</p> <p>Some <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-09/retail-traders-push-meme-strategies-into-options-worrying-pros\">reports</a> suggest retail investors have starting pouring into call options, a popular strategy during the 2021 bull run. If so, that hasn't showed up in the broad market metrics yet. Total US call volumes have fallen all year. The put-call ratio — a measure of whether bull or bear sentiment is prevailing — was unusually low throughout 2021, but has since normalised:</p> <p>By all appearances, meme stocks are off on their own. Is there any more to this than social media allowing for decentralised, co-ordinated pumping? Write in if you have thoughts.</p> <h1>A correction</h1> <p>A few readers spotted an error in last week's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed31966d-bc5e-416c-b36c-b04cce5945d9\">letter</a> on stock-based compensation. The piece said that RSUs (restricted stock units that vest in chunks over time) are taxed “upfront”, but this is wrong. In most cases, RSUs are taxed as ordinary income when shares vest. In a down market, employees who hang on to those shares can face steep tax bills if their employer doesn't withhold enough, or at all. Thanks to those pointed this out.</p> <h1>One good read</h1> <p>Nice try, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-grazie-dominos-pizza-closes-last-stores-in-italy-11660075989?mod=hp_featst_pos4\">Domino's</a>.</p><p>Source: Ethan Wu 2022 'Meet the new taxes' FT.com 10 August.
