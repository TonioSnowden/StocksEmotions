  "title": "Leonard Green Sets $17 Billion Goal for Latest Fundraising Round; Firm aiming to hold a first close for its flagship fund in February",
  "text": "<p>Pension documents also indicate that Leonard Green is seeking $3.25 billion for a separate fund called Jade Equity Investors II LP to back deals that are smaller than those it would support through its main funds. Leonard Green itself is pledging a total of at least $837 million to the two funds, while Louisiana Teachers approved $75 million in total commitments, the pension documents stated.</p><p>Leonard Green informed investors about its fundraising plans in the third quarter, WSJ Pro Private Equity reported.</p><p>Leonard Green historically focused heavily on the retail and consumer sectors, although with some of its more recent funds, the firm has evolved to primarily target service-oriented businesses within the healthcare, consumer, business services and industrial sectors, the documents stated. As of June 30, around 50% of the firm's previous large fund, a roughly $12 billion pool raised in 2019, was invested in business services and 31% was invested in consumer services, the document shows.</p><p>Through its new main fund, Leonard Green aims to invest equity checks ranging from $675 million to $1.4 billion in 15 to 20 companies, each with enterprise values of $1 billion to $3 billion, according to the documents. The previous fund, Green Equity Investors VIII LP, aimed to write checks of between $400 million and $1 billion, WSJ Pro Private Equity reported previously.</p><p>Through its new Jade Equity fund, the firm plans to invest equity checks of $50 million to $250 million in companies with enterprise values ranging from $250 million to $600 million, the pension documents stated.</p><p>As of June 30, the firm had invested its previous large fund in nine companies, while it had invested its first Jade Equity Investors fund, a $2.75 billion raised in 2019, in five companies. Although the pension documents didn't name the companies included in the portfolios, the firm last year announced investments in companies that included Rosemont, Ill.-based roofing services company Tecta America Corp., Bordeaux, France-based biotech startup TreeFrog Therapeutics; and Houston-based Visual Comfort &amp; Co., a company that markets designer lighting, alongside Goldman Sachs Asset Management.</p><p>Leonard Green joins a fundraising market that has grown increasingly crowded. Other firms that have returned to the fundraising trail over the past six to 12 months include consumer-focused L Catterton and TSG Consumer Partners, as well as Clearlake Capital Group, Vista Equity Partners, Thoma Bravo and Platinum Equity Partners. Blackstone Group is also reported to be preparing for its next fundraising effort, which could target as much as $30 billion, according to an October report by Bloomberg News.</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com</p>",
