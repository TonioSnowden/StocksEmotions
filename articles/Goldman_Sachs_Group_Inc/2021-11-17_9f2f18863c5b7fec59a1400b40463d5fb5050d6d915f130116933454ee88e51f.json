  "title": "Chinese Developers' Funding Lifeline Is Fraying",
  "text": "<p>China's housing market remains deep in the doldrums: New home sales last month fell 22.6% from a year earlier, worse than September's 15.8% drop. New home prices fell 0.2% from a month earlier, the second consecutive decline.</p><p>Meanwhile, developers have become more dependent on cash from sold but unbuilt apartments. Around a third of their funding came from such presales and deposits in 2020, according to China's statistics bureau. A slowing housing market therefore creates an immediate liquidity shortfall, especially when other capital sources are drying up: Funding for developers from domestic loans and foreign capital were both down 27% year on year in October. Goldman Sachs says bond issuance in October for the 100 developers it tracks fell 71% year on year to a record low.</p><p>Local governments are getting worried -- probably with some justification -- that some apartments will never get built.</p><p>As a result, they stepped up monitoring the use of funds from presales to make sure they are used for construction. Evergrande, the biggest whale of all, is one example. Local authorities required it to deposit presale funds in government monitored escrow accounts and submit applications for the funds to be disbursed.</p><p>That means, needless to say, some developers may not be able to use the money to repay debt even if they have the cash in theory -- one factor that is probably spooking bond markets. The widespread use of joint ventures at the project level also makes it harder to transfer cash out for debt repayment, since business partners may object.</p><p>Case in point: Developer Yango Group proposed a bond swap this month to effectively delay the maturity of some bonds that are coming due soon. According to rating agency Fitch, the company said a significant portion of the cash may not be available to repay debt because it consists of restricted funds and presale regulated funds. The company said restrictions on cash at its project companies have tightened further in the past few months.</p><p>There are some signs of policy easing coming. Some better quality developers like state-owned Poly Development have been approved to issue medium-term bonds in the domestic market. That seems to have alleviated some bond market concerns. Yields on state-backed Sino-Ocean debt maturing next year have fallen to 11.9%, after yielding as high as 33% last week -- though that's still much higher than the 2.5% that they were trading at last month.</p><p>More troubled developers, and their investors, may still be out of luck. The government wants cash spent on completing apartments. But without much more significant easing of the overall credit situation, that may mean not enough money left for bondholders.</p>",
