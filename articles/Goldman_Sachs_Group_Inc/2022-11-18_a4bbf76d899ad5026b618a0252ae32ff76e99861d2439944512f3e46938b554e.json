  "title": "The World Ahead 2023; Bosses are growing more desperate to get workers back to the office",
  "text": "<p>To tempt workers back and repopulate corporate digs, companies are offering generous—and increasingly desperate—freebies. Food is one example. Tech giants have long provided gourmet meals made by in-house chefs. Now, more firms are dangling free lunches, barbecues and a roster of food trucks to encourage office attendance. A survey by Fooda, which offers food programmes for workplaces, found that 80% of workers are more eager to return to the office when free lunch is provided.</p><p>Booze is another crowd-pleaser. Microsoft treated returning employees to beer and wine tastings, while tenants at Manhattan's Starrett-Lehigh building have their own 600-sq-ft (55-sq-metre) speakeasy. Elsewhere, perks range from on-site child care to dry cleaning and valet parking. Google hired Lizzo, a pop star, to perform for staff; GFP Real Estate, a Manhattan landlord, organised daily raffles for tickets to American football games. Bloomberg, a business-data provider, has offered staff a daily commuting allowance of $75.Pet-friendly workplaces are on the rise</p><p>Many are jazzing up their offices. Firms are splashing out on juice bars, meditation rooms and on-site gyms, all with the goal of creating a home away from home. Pet-friendly workplaces are also on the rise. At 22 Bishopsgate in London, home to companies such as Cooley, a law firm, pets have their own building passes. A wide range of other amenities is also on offer. Workers at Credit Suisse, a bank, have access to a Michelin-starred restaurant in their New York building. The office of L'Oréal, a cosmetics firm, in Hudson Yards features a nail salon.</p><p>Some firms are even ditching open-plan office layouts for more exciting set-ups. Salesforce has opened a ranch among the redwoods of Scotts Valley, California, where it will host training sessions for employees, as well as nature walks, yoga and cooking classes. Citi has opened a hub for junior bankers in the Spanish seaside city of Málaga.</p><p>The most ardent supporters of the office prefer tough love. Firms such as Goldman Sachs—whose chief executive, David Solomon, called remote work an “aberration”—are reining in the perks. In September, the bank yanked a crucial office perk from its front entrance: free coffee. It also lifted all covid-19 protocols and ordered its staff to return to five-day weeks. If the carrots do not work, other exasperated employers may also switch to using sticks.</p><p>■</p><p>Vinjeru Mkandawire: Property correspondent, The Economist</p><p>This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition of The World Ahead 2023 under the headline “A free lunch”</p>",
