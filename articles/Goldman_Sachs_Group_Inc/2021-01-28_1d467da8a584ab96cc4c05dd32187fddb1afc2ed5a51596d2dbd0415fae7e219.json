  "text": "<p>The head of the London Stock Exchange Group has warned that the government must move quickly to overhaul the UK's listing rules if it wants to challenge Wall Street for the next wave of tech companies going public.</p> <p>The message from David Schwimmer, who has led the LSE since 2018, comes as a review of the rules for company listings by former EU commissioner Jonathan Hill is due to be published next month.</p> <p>Commissioned by the government last November, the review will report amid a divide in the City over how far the listings regime should be relaxed to attract companies from sectors, such as tech, that have an ever bigger role in modern economies and increasingly dominate the US stock market.</p> <p>Corporate governance advocates are determined to uphold the gold standard of rules in the UK, while others believe a more radical overhaul is needed to compete against rival destinations for initial public offerings such as New York and Hong Kong.</p> <p>“I think it's worth looking at changing these rules, not doing it in a way that is a race to the bottom from a governance perspective, doing it in a thoughtful way,” Mr Schwimmer told the Financial Times.</p> <p>“I think it's important in terms of getting that right and doing it quickly because if you want to list, it's a very competitive market. You have a lot of options,” he added. </p> <p>The intervention from Mr Schwimmer comes as the LSE prepares on Friday to complete its $27bn acquisition of Refinitiv, the data and trading provider, in a blockbuster deal that will turn the 322-year old bourse into one of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb6b14bb-9af6-46a9-9fbf-78a6a02dbce0\">largest providers</a> of the market infrastructure and financial data.</p> <p>Mr Schwimmer said the biggest takeover in the LSE's history would “completely change how we interact with our trading customers” but insisted that share trading would always be a core part of the £31bn group.</p> <p>On the UK's listings regime, much of the debate has centred over the rules that apply to the top tier of companies floated in London, or so-called premium segment. </p> <p>Mr Schwimmer said that existing rules requiring start-ups, often owned by a founder or a small number of investors, to sell a minimum of 25 per cent of their company are a deterrent to potential IPO candidates. </p> <p>The former Goldman Sachs banker also backs the introduction of dual-class share structures, which allow founders to keep greater control of their businesses and are common in the US. </p> <p>“Those are issues that are important to companies that are looking to list,” he said. “The UK has a great environment for technology companies, for fintech companies and for science and biotech companies. We should not have a regulatory regime that pushes them to go to other markets because our listing regime has some rules that have not adapted in recent years.”</p> <p>Mr Schwimmer also stressed that the LSE was still committed to the EU market. To win approval for the Refinitiv deal from competition regulators in Brussels, the LSE agreed to sell Borsa Italiana, the operator of the Italian stock exchange, to rival Euronext for €4.3bn. </p> <p>“We did not want to sell Borsa Italiana,” he said. “If anything, the Refintiv transaction represents a doubling down of our presence in the EU. There's no sense that the divestiture of the Borsa Italiana assets is any kind of departure for the LSE.”</p> <p>The Refinitiv takeover will at a stroke triple the group's revenues to £7bn. It has also delivered a payday to advisers on the deal, who will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a3370be7-d52c-46ff-b3fb-8a459804a850\">share</a> $1.1bn in fees for advice and arranging its financing. </p> <p>Refinitiv's previous owners, a consortium led by private equity firm Blackstone, will hold a 37 per cent stake in the enlarged company.</p><p>Source: Philip Stafford 2021 'LSE boss says London must ‘move quickly' to attract prized companies' FT.com 28 January.
