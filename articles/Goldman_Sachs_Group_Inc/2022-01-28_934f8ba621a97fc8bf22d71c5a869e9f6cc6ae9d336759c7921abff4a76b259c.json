  "text": "<p>Inter Milan faces higher borrowing costs after a €415m return to the bond market following a bruising pandemic both for the Italian football club and its Chinese majority owner Suning.</p> <p>The debt refinancing by the reigning Serie A champions comes at a critical time for European football teams, which are still finding their feet after losing billions of euros in revenue because of stadium capacity restrictions to limit the spread of the virus.</p> <p>Although Inter's bond was in demand it came with a coupon, or yield, of 6.75 per cent, up from the 4.875 per cent cost of the €300m of notes issued in 2017, when it made its debt market debut. </p> <p>The refinancing is crucial to Inter Milan, led by President Steven Zhang, which won its first Serie A title in a decade in the 2020-21 season but subsequently sold star striker Romelu Lukaku and parted ways with its winning coach Antonio Conte amid a financial crunch. </p> <p>“Demand for the issue far exceeded supply, demonstrating the market's appreciation and confidence in the solidity of the club's project,” said Alessandro Antonello, corporate chief executive at Inter. </p> <p>This came “despite the turbulence recorded in recent weeks by the financial markets and the continuing uncertainty linked to the current pandemic scenario”, he added. </p> <p>Markets have been rocky as traders weigh up the prospects of higher interest rates and potential war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Serie A clubs are still playing in front of heavily reduced audiences whereas their rivals in the English Premier League are back at full capacity.</p> <p>Inter issued the bond, which was co-ordinated by Goldman Sachs as bookrunner, through a so-called MediaCo, an entity for its broadcast and sponsorship revenues that is separate to the football side of the business. </p> <p>Investors typically favour the stability of TV money but fear the football operations because of exposure to the industry's tendency to overpay to sign star players and cover their multimillion-euro wages.</p> <p>Inter recorded a net loss of €245m at group level in the 12 months ended June 30, up from €102m a year earlier, as higher revenues were more than offset by increased costs. The club also suffered from minimal match day revenue.</p> <p>Suning last year obtained a €275m loan from Los Angeles-based asset manager Oaktree Capital to help Inter meet its cash needs. Documentation for Inter's bond warns that Chinese government policy could limit how much Suning can invest in the business, following a clampdown on overseas sports acquisitions.</p> <p>The documents also showed that Inter lost out on millions of dollars of revenue after contracts with a series of Chinese sponsors were terminated.</p> <p>Inter was among the 12 elite teams that backed the creation of a so-called European Super League last April but swiftly pulled out of the project after fans protested and politicians issued warnings to clubs. </p> <p>The project was designed to restore club finances by creating a new Europe-wide club competition for a select group with the aim of boosting broadcast revenues and ensuring their participation every year.</p><p>Source: Samuel Agini and Robert Smith 2022 'Inter Milan returns to bond market with €415m debt refinancing' FT.com 28 January.
