  "title": "Dow Declines to End Week as Russia, Ukraine Concerns Mount; Strong U.S. jobs number wasn't enough to lift stocks",
  "text": "<p>The Dow dropped 179.86 points, or 0.5%, to 33614.80 on Friday, falling 1.3% for the week. The S&amp;P 500 fell 34.62 points, or 0.8%, to 4328.87. The Nasdaq Composite shed 224.50 points, or 1.7%, to 13313.44. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq lost 1.3% and 2.8%, respectively, this week.</p><p>Shares of banks and other financial-services companies led the way lower, while energy companies notched big gains. Occidental Petroleum gained 45% this week, while Chevron has added 13%.</p><p>In the U.S., a sharp run-up in commodity prices has raised concerns about economic growth at a time when prices have already been at a 40-year high.</p><p>Front-month futures prices for Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, rose 25% this week to $118.11, closing at the highest level since 2013. Corn futures recorded the biggest weekly gain since 2008. Wheat prices had their best week since at least 1959.</p><p>\"It's beginning to look a little stagflationary,\" said Anwiti Bahuguna, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle, referring to the combination of muted economic growth and high inflation. \"We have inflation sticking around longer and growth taking a leg down.\"</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group analysts said Thursday that higher oil-and-gas prices are the \"key inflation risk for the United States\" and that higher commodity prices threaten economic growth. Rising crude oil prices can lower GDP growth, they said, as consumers pull back on spending because of higher gas prices. Investors remained focused on the sharp rise in oil prices for much of the week.</p><p>\"It feels like it's going to get a little higher from here, and it's just a question of how much higher,\" said Tom Reilly, an energy derivatives broker at TP ICAP Group, of oil prices, adding that there have been some sleepless nights for traders over the past week. \"People are kind of waking up every couple hours and checking things to make sure things have not gotten too far out of whack.\"</p><p>Rising oil prices and the prospect of slower economic growth also have pushed investors into traditionally safer investments such as government bonds, while gold prices have risen to the highest level since 2020.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined to 1.722%, recording its biggest one-week yield decline since March 2020 as bond prices rallied. Bond yields have swung wildly throughout the week as investors have monitored the Russian invasion, comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and economic data.</p><p>A strong jobs number early Friday wasn't enough to push major indexes higher or stall the decline in bond yields.</p><p>New data on Friday showed that the U.S. added 678,000 jobs in February, more than the 440,000 expected by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal. The Fed has signaled that it is on track for a quarter-percentage-point interest-rate increase at its March meeting, removing some near-term uncertainty about interest rates.</p><p>\"The jobs report was strong,\" said Amy Kong, chief investment officer at Barrett Asset Management. But \"it doesn't necessarily change the Fed stance,\" she said.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 index dropped 7% this week, its biggest weekly decline since March 2020. It closed at its lowest level in around a year, reflecting concerns that Europe will bear the brunt of the economic fallout from the Russia-Ukraine crisis. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has driven demand for cryptocurrencies in both countries, boosting the price of bitcoin.</p><p>The week was marked by frenetic trading in exchange-traded funds tied to Russia. The New York Stock Exchange halted trading in some Russia-linked exchange-traded funds, following a similar move with NYSE-listed Russian stocks earlier this week. Index providers moved to drop Russian stocks from influential indexes. Russia's central bank kept theMoscow stock market largely closed for a fifth straight day, shielding local shares from a potential selloff.</p><p>Earlier in the week, clearinghouse operator Euroclear stopped investors from clearing trades involving ruble-denominated securities, while its competitor, Clearstream, said it would stop settling trades for various Russian-linked stocks and bonds, leaving some traders in the dark about their positions.</p><p>The Russian ruble lost 26% against the greenback this week, its worst week since 1998. The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of 16 others, rose to its highest closing value since 2020.</p><p>Despite the volatility around the globe, stocks in New York have been relatively resilient amid the conflict. The S&amp;P 500 is above levels recorded last week, when Russia first invaded Ukraine.</p><p>\"The U.S. is less vulnerable to the Russia-Ukraine crisis than what you would see in Europe,\" said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. For now, she said, \"The market is looking at [the situation] and saying the U.S. economy is strong.\"</p><p>Still, the week's losses dragged the S&amp;P 500 almost 10% from its high, while the Nasdaq is now down 17% from its recent high.</p><p>In corporate news, shares of Smith &amp; Wesson Brands dropped $2.24, or 13%, to $15.65 after the gun maker reported that sales fell more than 30% during the holiday quarter.</p><p>Asian stocks fell, in part reflecting Thursday's actionon Wall Street, where technology stocks sold off more than the broader market and U.S.-listed Chinese companies stumbled. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 2.2% lower Friday. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 2.5%, registering its lowest close since March 2020.</p><p>â€”Joe Wallace and Alexander Osipovich contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Gunjan Banerji at gunjan.banerji@wsj.com and Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Declines to End Week as Russia, Ukraine Concerns Mount</p>",
