  "title": "Jamie Houghton Came Back for a Second Shot at Running Corning; Former CEO, who has died at age 86, returned in 2002 to rescue firm devastated by telecom bust",
  "text": "<p>Over the next four years, sales more than doubled. Meanwhile, Corning blew billions of dollars on overpriced acquisitions of photonics companies, supplying electronic components to guide light signals through optical fibers. Then came a sudden drop in telecom investment that plunged Corning deeply into the red and forced an overhaul that eliminated nearly 20,000 jobs. The stock crashed to $1.10 in 2002 from a peak of $113 in 2000.</p><p>Corning's board reinstalled Mr. Houghton as CEO in April 2002. The company ditched the photonics business and concentrated more on liquid-crystal-display glass for computers and TV sets. Mr. Houghton put a renewed focus on quality and hired a psychologist to coach senior managers on teamwork. Corning was profitable again in 2005 when he gave up the CEO job for the second time and began heading into retirement.</p><p>Mr. Houghton died Dec. 20 at his home in Boston. He was 86 years old and had suffered from frontal lobe dementia for 11 years.</p><p>In 2002, having a Houghton back at the helm was reassuring for many shellshocked employees at Corning, where family members had steered the company since 1851 and oversaw an early boom in supplying glass casings for Thomas Edison's lightbulbs.</p><p>Mr. Houghton, who once described himself as \"one of the most organized people in the world,\" sang hymns and show tunes, built stone walls on his property, and wrote lyrics and poems for family occasions. He was known to wear red polka dot suspenders. He kept an apartment on Central Park West in Manhattan and spent summers in Dark Harbor, Maine.</p><p>James Richardson Houghton, known as Jamie, was born April 6, 1936, in Corning, N.Y. His father, Amory Houghton, served as U.S. Ambassador to France during the Eisenhower administration and was chairman of the company. His mother, Laura Houghton, was a director of the Girl Scouts of America.</p><p>Jamie Houghton studied European history at Harvard College, where he graduated in 1958. He started graduate business studies, struggled and left to serve in the Army and work for Goldman Sachs in New York. He then returned to Harvard and earned his M.B.A. degree in 1962.</p><p>While he was at Harvard, a friend set him up for a date with Maisie Kinnicutt, who was studying American history and literature at Radcliffe College. She was expecting a different suitor and initially was startled to see a tall stranger at her door. Six months later, they were married.</p><p>More Obituaries</p><p>* Arnold Fulton Escaped the Holocaust and Became an Innovative Umbrella Maker (Dec. 24)</p><p>* Scott Minerd, Guggenheim Partners' Investment Chief, Dies at Age 63 (Dec. 22)</p><p>* Edward Avedisian, a Clarinetist, Gave Away More Than $125 Million (Dec. 21)</p><p>* Franco Harris, Steelers Hall of Fame Running Back, Dies at 72 (Dec. 21)</p><p>After completing his graduate studies, Mr. Houghton and his new wife moved to Danville, Ky., where he began his Corning career as a factory shift foreman. In the late 1960s, he had postings in Zurich and Brussels before moving to the head office in Corning, where he helped launch Corelle dinnerware.</p><p>In 1983, he succeeded an older brother, Amory Houghton Jr., known as Amo, as chief executive. Amo Houghton went on to serve as a Republican congressman. Jamie Houghton, viewed as more hard-nosed and focused on profitability than his older brother, quickly cut costs and shed slow-growth businesses, including lightbulbs. He invested heavily in fiber optics and other high-tech fields.</p><p>\"We're no longer a simple little glass and chemicals company,\" Mr. Houghton said in a 1987 interview. \"We've become more aggressive.\"</p><p>He regularly gathered top aides for dinners with wine and cigars. \"In vino veritas,\" he told Fortune in a later interview. \"There would be some violent arguments, but we got to know each other really well.\"</p><p>In 1993, Mr. Houghton's right leg was crushed when he was hit by a car after stepping off a curb in Williamsburg, Va. He was in the hospital for more than a month. \"They had to drill in and take the fluid out of the brain,\" he told the New York Times. \"Everybody says, 'Jeez, what a terrible thing.' And I say, 'I'm so happy to be here I can't tell you.'\" He used a cane for walking.</p><p>\"This company is in my bones,\" Mr. Houghton said after returning as CEO in 2002 at the age of 66. \"I'm going to be walking the company halls more than you can imagine. Even on my bad leg.\" Even so, he paced himself more carefully than earlier in his career. He aimed to visit Asia once a year instead of four times.</p><p>He avoided assigning blame for the company's crash to any individual. \"Maybe you could look back and say we shouldn't have gone so far in photonics,\" he told Forbes. \"We bet a lot of money on it.\"</p><p>Mr. Houghton also was a director at Exxon Mobil Corp., a member of Harvard's governing board and chairman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p><p>He is survived by his wife, two children and four grandchildren. In retirement, he found time to take drawing lessons and read history.</p><p>Write to James R. Hagerty at bob.hagerty@wsj.com</p><p>Jamie Houghton Came Back for a Second Shot at Running Corning</p>",
