Driving the surge was an increase in costs for energy along with shelter, food, used cars and trucks and new vehicles. </p> <p>The energy index rose 4.8 per cent from September, while the gasoline index increased by 6.1 per cent. On an annual basis, these sectors are up 30 per cent and 50 per cent, respectively.</p> <p>Speaking on a visit to Baltimore yesterday afternoon Biden acknowledged that rising prices were a concern for US households. “Everything from a gallon of gas to loaf of bread costs more,” he said.</p> <p>The rising prices threaten to undercut the US economic recovery, jeopardise the president's spending plans and doom the Democratic party in next year's midterm elections. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve may also be forced to tighten monetary policy quicker than previously expected. The central bank has already announced the wind-down of its $120bn-a-month asset purchase programme at a pace that signals the stimulus will cease altogether by June.&#xa0;Economists and market participants are increasingly of the view that the Fed will raise interest rates soon after.</p> <p>US government debt <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62a3bcb6-a171-4284-bb71-b8d837a07e8d\">sold off sharply</a> yesterday after the release of the inflation report, especially debt with short-term maturities which are more sensitive to interest rate expectations.</p> <p><em>Thanks for reading FirstFT Americas.
