  "title": "BlackRock warns investors should buy defensive stocks and bonds as tech-led rally at risk of fizzling",
  "text": "<p>This view is based on the notion that hopes for a \"Fed pivot\", involving the Federal Reserve moving away from its plans to raise interest rates further, are badly misplaced, while signs of corporate performance are deteriorating, and inflation is the services sector is shaping up to be far stickier than investors presently expect.</p><p>According to BlackRock's Gargi Chaudhuri, head of iShares investment strategy for the Americas, the asset management giant's in-house metrics are flashing contradictory signals about the state of the U.S. consumer and the corporate sector.</p><p>But once the market wakes up to the fact that the Fed pivot is still a long way off, stocks could be at risk of reversing some or all of the growth-led rally that has seen the Nasdaq Composite COMP and Russell 1000 Growth Index outperform RLG the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIAand S&amp;P 500 over the past month. While the surging cost of energy and other goods has garnered most of the attention this year, Chaudhuri fears services inflation like the rising cost of housing will blindside the market by being far stickier than investors and economists presently expect.</p><p>Should this pan out, investors would be best to focus their portfolio on\"defensive\" plays, including high-grade corporate bonds and low-volatility stocks.</p><p>See: Goldman Sachs says it's too soon for markets to be trading `a full Fed pivot'</p><p>Some ETFs recommended by Chaudhuri include: the iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETF USMV, the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF LQD, the iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF IHFand the iShares 1-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF IGSB .</p><p>BlackRock's worries may already be playing out on Tuesday, as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite led markets lower, driven by plunging semiconductor stocks like Nvidia NVDAand Micron Technology Inc. MU The Nasdaq was down 1.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 was down just 0.5% by comparison.</p><p>BlackRock warns investors should buy defensive stocks and bonds as tech-led rally at risk of fizzling</p>",
