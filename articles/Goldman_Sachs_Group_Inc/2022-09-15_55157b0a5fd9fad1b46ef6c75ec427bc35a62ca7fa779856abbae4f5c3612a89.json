  "title": "California Enacts Tough New Law on Children's Online Privacy; The law, which extends existing federal protections, could cost companies thousands of dollars per child for each violation",
  "text": "<p>\"We're taking aggressive action in California to protect the health and well-being of our kids,\" Mr. Newsom said in a statement announcing the signing of the bill.</p><p>Companies must comply with the California law by July 1, 2024. But some privacy advocates say California businesses should start preparing now for the law's implementation.</p><p>\"It's broader than you might anticipate on who would be impacted and who would need to really start thinking about these issues,\" said Michelle Reed, co-head of the cybersecurity, privacy and data protection practice at law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld LLP.</p><p>There are stiff penalties for noncompliance with certain requirements, including a civil penalty of up to $2,500 per affected child for each negligent violation, or up to $7,500 per affected child for each intentional violation.</p><p>The U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, or Coppa—existing federal law, which became effective in 2000—imposes certain requirements on operators of websites or online services made for children under age 13.</p><p>The California law, however, applies to minors broadly and to companies that aren't marketing directly to children. This means companies of all types will need to determine how likely it is their sites will be accessed by children, even if the company doesn't specifically target them, Ms. Reed said.</p><p>The most significant impact is likely to be on companies that aren't specifically directing their services to children, but that might have a significant number of children accessing their site, said Caitlin Fennessy, chief knowledge officer at the International Association of Privacy Professionals, a nonprofit professional organization whose members include corporate privacy officers and advocates.</p><p>Businesses without international operations that haven't had to comply with strict European privacy regulations will also have to start assessing how they would meet new California strictures, she said.</p><p>The law is controversial in some circles. Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, wrote in a blog that it \"would radically reshape the Internet—and harm both kids and adults alike.\" He contends that users will stop clicking freely because of the hassles likely involved with having to prove their age. \"The Internet will lose some vibrancy as a result,\" wrote Mr. Goldman who teaches and writes about internet law, intellectual property and advertising law.</p><p>Coppa \"has serious problems, but this bill doesn't fix any of those problems, it treats those problems as features and expands on them massively,\" wrote Mike Masnick, founder and CEO of Floor64, a business development service in Redwood City, Calif., in a blog.</p><p>\"According to the law, I need to ‘estimate the age of child users with a reasonable level of certainty.' How? Am I really going to have to start age-verifying every visitor to the site? It seems like I risk serious liability in not doing so. And then what?\" he wrote. Some data privacy experts predict that other states will propose their own children's privacy laws, similar to what happened after California led the way on internet data privacy. An updated federal law could be proposed to address children's privacy, but privacy experts don't expect anything to be introduced this year. If a federal bill is ultimately proposed, California legislators aren't likely to accept anything less than the protections their state bill offers, Ms. Reed said.</p><p>The law will force companies that are designing new products to think about how they can ensure the safety of children, which is a positive step, said Irene Ly, policy counsel at San Francisco-based Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that promotes safe technology and media for children. How effective it ultimately is will depend on future federal legislation, she added.</p><p>Companies can start preparing by understanding which of their websites might attract minors, said Dominique Shelton Leipzig, a partner at Mayer Brown who specializes in cybersecurity and data privacy. Companies can then think through how to address potential trouble spots, such as services or features that could harm children. \"This is the most robust consumer protection law for children that I've ever seen,\" she said.</p><p>The legislation calls for companies to conduct a risk mitigation assessment for any online service, product or feature offered to the public and likely to be accessed by children before July 1, 2024. Companies must evaluate before launching any new feature, and review these assessments every two years.</p><p>Vague or confusing aspects of the legislation raise questions for privacy officials, Ms. Fennessy said. For example, the law only applies to Californian children—not across the U.S., she said. It is possible that companies could try to tailor their privacy laws geographically versus applying the same standards everywhere.</p><p>Some companies might, for now, ignore the children's privacy requirements and hope to evade enforcement actions, said Justin Brookman, director of technology policy at Consumer Reports, a Yonkers, N.Y.-based nonprofit known for its product testing and research. Companies could also challenge the law's constitutionality, as happened with social media regulation laws in other states, he said. In Florida, for example, online industry groups are taking aim at a 2021 law that clamps down on social media titans such as Facebook and Twitter over decisions to oust politicians from their platforms.</p><p>He isn't alone in thinking some companies will ignore it. \"It creates a massive amount of busy work for almost all companies with a website, almost all of which will ignore it,\" Mr. Masnick wrote in his blog. The biggest companies, and maybe some midsize companies, will likely comply with the risk assessment, he predicted. \"But every smaller company is going to just totally ignore it,\" he wrote.</p><p>Businesses would benefit from guidance on how to comply from the California Attorney General's office, which would be responsible for enforcing the law, Ms. Shelton Leipzig said. European Union regulators did this well after adopting the strict General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in 2018, she said. The new California law mandates that a working group of experts report to the California legislature before January 2024, on best practices for implementation.</p><p>Among other things, this group would take input from various stakeholders, including businesses and consumer advocacy groups, to assist in the long-term development of data privacy policies affecting children.</p>",
