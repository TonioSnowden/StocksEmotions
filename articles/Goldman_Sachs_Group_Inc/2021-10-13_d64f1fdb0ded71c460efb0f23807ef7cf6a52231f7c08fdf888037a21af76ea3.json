  "title": "Clarida Defends Himself Amid Federal Reserve Trading Controversy; Investment activity by the central bank's No. 2 official is under scrutiny",
  "text": "<p>The central banker's comments came immediately after he finished reading a prepared address regarding the economy. Mr. Clarida has been facing heat over a financial disclosure statement that showed he had shifted between $1 million and $5 million from one mutual fund into two other funds in late February 2020, just ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaling the possibility of a rate cut.</p><p>Scrutiny of Mr. Clarida's trade came as two regional Fed banks recently disclosed their presidents actively traded in financial markets even as they helped set monetary policy for the central bank.</p><p>Disclosure forms for Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan showed active multimillion-dollar trading across stocks and other investments going back to 2015, the year the former Goldman Sachs executive became leader of that bank. Meanwhile, information from the Boston Fed showed its chief, Eric Rosengren, a career central banker who took command of his bank in 2007, traded at a more modest scale, including investments in real-estate securities particularly sensitive to central bank policy actions.</p><p>Both regional Fed leaders announced their exits on Sept. 27 and are now gone from the central bank. Mr. Rosengren cited a health issue that accelerated a mandatory retirement because of his age. Mr. Kaplan said he was stepping down because his trading issue was distracting from the central bank's broader mission.</p><p>Both regional bank presidents said their trading was consistent with Fed ethics rules that limit when officials can trade, prohibit owning bank stock, and that caution avoiding financial activities that raise concerns about conflicts of interest.</p><p>The Fed is now reviewing its ethics code, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell having acknowledged the rules need updating. The Fed has also initiated a review by its Office of the Inspector General of the trading, and the Dallas and Boston Fed banks have said they would fully cooperate, clearing up some legal ambiguities surrounding their relationship with the central bank's in-house investigator.</p><p>That said, some believe a more aggressive inquiry is needed. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, (D., Mass.) said last week the Securities and Exchange Commission should investigate the trading situation, saying in a letter that the trading raised \"serious questions about possible conflicts of interest\" and showed \"a disregard for the public trust.\"</p><p>Ms. Warren's letter also said that \"if these trades were based on Fed officials' knowledge of non-public, market moving information, they may have represented potentially illegal activity.\"</p><p>Write to Michael S.
