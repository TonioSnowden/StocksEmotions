  "title": "Natural-Gas Shortage  Sets Off a Scramble  ----  By Joe Wallace, Collin Eaton and Benoit Faucon",
  "text": "<p>   Myrina, a tanker chartered by Royal Dutch Shell PLC, set sail to Asia from the west coast of France last month carrying liquefied natural gas. When it was about to enter the Strait of Gibraltar, the captain received a call, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   \"We have to go to Rotterdam now,\" his boss in London told him, according to one of the people. The ship made a U-turn and backtracked up the coast of Spain and France to drop off part of its cargo at the Dutch port. On Thursday, it arrived in Bilbao, Spain, to deliver the rest of its load. </p><p>   Buyers in Europe, Asia and Latin America are competing for limited supplies of gas, racing to fill tanks and caverns with the fuel before winter hits the Northern Hemisphere. </p><p>   Natural-gas stocks are alarmingly low around the world, and prices in most places have never been higher after surging to records in Europe and Asia this week. Demand has jumped as economies have bounced back from pandemic shutdowns, and the squeeze has caught traders, shipowners and energy executives off guard. </p><p>   Tight supplies from Russia and demand in China and Latin America have made European economies including Spain, the Netherlands and the U.K. particularly vulnerable. The countries in recent years have wound down coal-fired plants and become more dependent on gas. </p><p>   Even in the U.S., the world's largest producer of natural gas, the bidding war has dragged up prices to their highest in over a decade, setting the stage for an expensive winter heating season and higher electricity bills. </p><p>   Shippers are diverting tankers to the highest bidder, a rare occurrence that adds to the uncertainty in the market. Manufacturers are slowing production because of energy prices, putting the post-pandemic recovery at risk. And China and Europe are firing up coal- and oil-fed plants, setting back progress in moving toward less-carbon-emitting sources of energy. </p><p>   \"The system has gone haywire,\" said Oystein Kalleklev, chief executive of Flex LNG Ltd., owner of a fleet of vessels that transport LNG. </p><p>   The market is unlikely to smooth out soon. The incentives for producers have changed as their investors favor companies that pursue stability rather than chase short-term price moves. </p><p>   Even if they did, LNG plants and tankers exporting LNG from the U.S. are already close to capacity, and building more is a long-term proposition. Political and regulatory hurdles to getting a major new pipeline to Europe, Nord Stream 2, up and running, meanwhile, may be holding back Russia, another large natural-gas producer, from adding to supply. </p><p>   On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow was ready to work on stabilizing the global energy market, signaling he could help tamp down the growing crisis in Europe. He said Moscow was a reliable supplier that always fulfills all its obligations. Still, some officials, traders and analysts have said that Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom PJSC has been slow to increase gas flows. </p><p>   The supply-and-demand imbalance is playing out as world leaders prepare to meet in Glasgow at the United Nations climate conference, which begins Oct. 31, to make big promises about weaning themselves off carbon-based sources of energy. </p><p>   The recent shortages are complicating the way nations are managing the switch to wind and solar power. Plentiful gas gave governments and companies confidence to press ahead with the renewables -- because in a pinch power systems could always fall back on cheap gas, which emits around half as much carbon as coal. </p><p>   For more than a decade, frackers in Appalachia and Texas used new technology to pump huge amounts of natural gas, pushing the price down. A global market developed for gas exported from terminals along the East and Gulf Coasts. In Europe, especially, governments moved toward producing energy with the less-expensive fuel, and coal and oil-fired power stations in some countries sat idle or were mothballed. </p><p>   In recent months, many of those power plants have been brought back online, in turn helping push up prices for oil and coal. </p><p>   Those rocketing energy prices threaten to goose inflation, snarl industrial activity and slow the revival in the world economy from Covid-19 shutdowns. </p><p>   Late last month, China's Vice Premier Han Zheng, who supervises the nation's energy policies, ordered leaders of the country's top state-owned energy companies to \"increase coal supplies by all means,\" The Wall Street Journal reported. </p><p>   Economists at Goldman Sachs Group said they think China's economy didn't expand in the third quarter compared with the second. One reason: Energy-intensive industries such as factories and smelters have cut output, prompted by orders to limit energy demand as well as fuel and power shortages. </p><p>   China has been consuming more of the world's natural gas as authorities push manufacturers to move toward cleaner fuels and the country's changing policies helped create a shortage of coal. It is forecast by the International Energy Agency to account for 30% of the global rise in gas demand by 2024. </p><p>   In Europe, record prices for natural gas, coal and carbon allowances that heavy emitters are required to own have fed on each other and pushed electricity prices to all-time highs. </p><p>   Zinc producer Nyrstar Netherlands (Holdings) BV began to slow its electrified plant in Budel-Dorplein in mid-September after power prices jumped. The plant has been running below full capacity for up to a few hours a day when electricity prices are at their peak. Zinc coatings are used on steel, and the metal is an ingredient in plastics, batteries and pharmaceuticals. </p><p>   It is the first time Nyrstar has taken such measures since energy markets leapt in 2008-09 amid rapid growth in China's economy, said Guido Janssen, vice president of European operations. \"It's really not a normal situation,\" he said. </p><p>   Norwegian fertilizer giant Yara International ASA cut ammonia production in Europe by 40% in September, saying record-high gas prices made the process unprofitable. Natural gas is an ingredient in ammonia, which is used in fertilizers. </p><p>   British Steel Ltd. this month began charging an extra $25 a metric ton for its alloy metal in order to pass a portion of its energy costs onto customers. </p><p>   \"The colossal costs we now face make it impossible to profitably make steel at certain times of the day,\" a British Steel spokesperson said. </p><p>   In North America, the fuel is more expensive than it has been since the fracking industry remade the market. </p><p>   If U.S. natural gas prices keep climbing to about $10 per million British thermal units, up from almost $6 now, some manufacturers won't be able to turn a profit and may have to shut some operations, said Paul Cicio, president of manufacturing trade group Industrial Energy Consumers of America. </p><p>   \"Anytime the price of natural gas has gone up in the U.S., there's a direct reduction in manufacturing jobs,\" Mr. Cicio said in an interview. </p><p>   Global demand for LNG rose 5.3% in the first nine months of 2021 from the year-earlier period, according to market intelligence firm Kpler, after pandemic lockdowns. </p><p>   Supply has been slow to respond, in part because of extreme and unusual weather. Gas wells froze in Texas in February, and hurricanes shut down gas production in the Gulf of Mexico late this summer. Wind speeds have been slower than normal in Europe, crimping power generation from renewables. </p><p>   Europe's 2020-21 winter dragged on, cutting into the time usually used to rebuild gas stocks. On average over the past five years, stocks in Europe have been 18% higher at the start of October than they are this year, according to Natasha Fielding, an analyst at Argus Media. </p><p>   Droughts in Brazil, southern China and the U.S. parched hydroelectric dams. As Brazil's hydropower output has fallen, the country joined the skirmish over gas supplies, importing the most LNG since at least 2013 last month, Kpler data showed. </p><p>   Longer-term developments in the way the gas market works have moved more cargoes to the world's highest bidders. </p><p>   Historically, long-term contracts dominated the LNG market, as the developers of export terminals sold a large percentage of their capacity to buyers before they built the facilities. Capacity that went unsold left room for spot cargoes, which are readily available and untied to long-term contracts. </p><p>   These days, with several more export facilities online, particularly in the U.S., the proliferation of spot cargoes has created a market more sensitive to price swings. </p><p>   The disruption has left the world in a high-stakes bidding war. Asian buyers in South Korea and Japan, more accustomed to paying high prices for energy, kept bids elevated over the summer. That drew vessels east, starving Europe of LNG during the period it usually builds up stocks for the winter. </p><p>   Europe gained more of an upper hand of late. A key benchmark for European natural gas pricing has traded at comparable levels to the marker that tracks Asian LNG prices, likely helping attract more gas to Europe, analysts said. </p><p>   European LNG imports were up about 35% in September compared with August, according to Kpler. Gaslog Salem, an LNG tanker that had departed from the Gulf Coast toward Asia, rerouted toward the Mediterranean late last week, according to vessel-tracking firms. </p><p>   In some cases, cargoes have been diverted because traders sell the product to higher bidders and compensate the original buyer, or shippers cancel contracts in favor of bigger profits, according to vessel-trackers and industry consultants. </p><p>   \"The market is allocating supply by price, which is unusual -- that historically has not been how LNG has worked,\" said Jason Feer, head of business intelligence at shipbroker Poten &amp; Partners Inc. \"It's the coming of age of LNG as a more commoditized market.\" </p><p></p>",
