  "title": "Oil Demand Set to Rise  In Shift From Coal, Gas  ----  By David Hodari",
  "text": "<p>   Soaring natural-gas and coal prices are pressuring power-generation companies and manufacturers to switch to using oil, a trend that could add half a million barrels a day to global demand, the International Energy Agency said. </p><p>   In its monthly market report, the IEA increased its global oil-demand forecasts for this year and the next by 170,000 and 210,000 barrels a day, respectively, but added that the cumulative effect of the energy crisis could be as large as 500,000 barrels a day from September through next year's first quarter. </p><p>   That increase means the IEA, which acts as the energy watchdog for the wealthy nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, expects the world's thirst for crude next year to exceed pre-pandemic levels at 99.6 million barrels a day. </p><p>   Oil prices added to early gains on Thursday following the release of the IEA's report, with Brent crude rising 1% to $84 a barrel. U.S. crude futures climbed 1.1% to $81.31 a barrel, closing at seven-year highs. </p><p>   Both benchmarks have increased more than 60% this year, accelerating in recent months in part because of tight supply elsewhere in the energy market. </p><p>   \"An acute shortage of natural gas, [liquefied natural gas] and coal supplies stemming from the gathering global economic recovery has sparked a precipitous run-up in prices for energy supplies and is triggering a massive switch to oil products and direct crude use for power generation,\" the Paris-based organization said in its report, adding that power-generation plants, fertilizer producers, manufacturing operations and refineries are all affected. </p><p>   The shortage of relatively low-carbon but expensive natural gas -- some analysts say the commodity is two to three times more expensive than the equivalent amount of oil -- and the trend of switching to more emissions-intensive fuels such as crude products comes weeks before leaders from around the world descend on Glasgow for United Nations-led climate negotiations. </p><p>   Some analysts say the IEA's forecast of an extra 500,000 barrels a day in demand from the energy crisis may be conservative. </p><p>   \"We have never had a situation like this where oil is extremely cheap [versus gas] so we just don't have empirical evidence\" for how much oil demand may increase, said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets. \"It could very well be more than a million barrels,\" he added. </p><p>   Relatively weak natural-gas inventories for the time of year and low wind levels in Europe have coincided with the post-pandemic economic recovery, coal shortages in China and the possibility of a cold Northern Hemisphere winter to send fossil-fuel prices soaring. Benchmark European gas prices have leapt 184% in the past three months. </p><p>   IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Wednesday that extreme weather events -- such as Hurricane Ida in the Gulf of Mexico, droughts stymieing hydroelectric power in China and Brazil, and widespread flooding -- have also contributed to the energy crunch. </p><p>   He added that supply choke points, including pandemic-delayed maintenance work, meant that natural-gas outages are currently 40% higher than average. </p><p>   As a result, some analysts have observed a rise in the trend known as gas-to-oil switching, whereby power plants that run on oil are fired up or ones that can be converted to run on crude products are being switched over. </p><p>   Goldman Sachs cited this in raising its oil-price forecasts in late September, while energy-consulting firm Rystad Energy said it expects the Asian power sector to use 400,000 more barrels a day of oil than it previously did in the next six months. </p><p></p>",
