  "title": "Manchin Rejected Biden Bill Over Inflation, Debt Concerns. How Founded Are Those Worries? Economists see mostly small effects on prices and federal deficits from president's proposed spending plan",
  "text": "<p>Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), whose support would be key for the proposal's prospects in a narrowly divided Senate, reiterated Sunday many of the concerns he has aired publicly about the bill, including its possible impact on inflation and the nation's debt. He said he couldn't support the bill in its current form.</p><p>Here is a look at some of the issues driving the debate.</p><p>What concerns about inflation do critics of the spending bill have?</p><p>Republicans argue that Congress shouldn't pass a large spending package right now, given the trillions of dollars in federal money that have already gone out to support the economy during the pandemic. Skeptics have especially focused on a $2 trillion aid package Democrats passed in March, saying that it overheated consumer demand and boosted inflation, which reached a 39-year high in November, by putting more money into Americans' pockets as the economy had started to show improvement.</p><p>Republicans also note that many of the package's provisions, such as a federally subsidized child-care program for low- and middle-income families, are set to expire before 10 years, the period over which the Biden administration says the proposal's spending is fully offset. Republicans contend Democrats intend to extend those programs beyond what is currently proposed, a move the GOP argues would require much larger deficit spending.</p><p>Democrats have said any program extensions would have to be financed by corresponding offsets.</p><p>The package \"will make inflation worse. It will grow the government to the point we will never be able to pay for it. It will add to the deficit in a monumental way,\" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), the ranking member on the Senate Budget Committee. Some economists see a potential connection between persistent large deficits and higher inflation in the longer run.</p><p>How would Build Back Better affect federal spending in the short-term?</p><p>The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the package would add to the federal deficit in each of its first five years, while subtracting from it in each of the last five years. Overall, the CBO estimates the proposal would add $367 billion to the federal deficit over 10 years, an amount many economists say isn't particularly large. Still, early on, the proposal's spending would outweigh any revenue it generates.</p><p>David Mericle, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, said some of the package's spending would likely increase aggregate demand in the economy—and thereby inflation—next year: \"It would be dishonest to say it has zero effect,\" he said.</p><p>But Mr. Mericle expects the impact to be only incremental because the federal government next year won't be spending heavily on aid programs as it did earlier in the pandemic, and households broadly will likely continue spending down pandemic assistance they have received.</p><p>He estimates that fiscal support enacted during the Trump and Biden administrations reached its peak impact during the second quarter of 2021, boosting the level of U.S. gross domestic product by about 8% above what it would have been without the federal spending. As the effects of pandemic aid programs fade, he expects the bump to GDP from fiscal support to fall to 2% by the end of 2022 if the social-spending package passes, or to roughly 1.5% if the bill doesn't pass.</p><p>Mr. Mericle added that other factors contributing to inflation right now, particularly supply-chain bottlenecks, will likely have greater implications for inflation's trajectory in the short term.</p><p>\"The amount of fiscal support that we're talking about in 2022 from Build Back Better is just not very big, and so the inflation consequences are just a lot more modest than all of these other sources of uncertainty for next year,\" he said.</p><p>What parts of the package could cause inflation in the near term?</p><p>The package's proposal to extend monthly child-tax-credit payments to households that began in 2021 could be slightly inflationary, some economists say.</p><p>The program, which provides eligible families with as much as $300 for children under age 6 and $250 for children ages 6-17, has distributed more than $16 billion since disbursements began in July, according to the Treasury Department. The program's final payment was sent in December, but the social-spending plan would continue the payments through 2022.</p><p>Wendy Edelberg, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said she estimates extending the child tax credit would boost inflation in 2022 slightly, by about one-tenth of a percentage point relative to where it would be under current law.</p><p>Much of the bill's other spending on policies such as clean-energy projects, child care and paid family leave would have limited effect on inflation because they don't provide cash directly to households, said Nancy Vanden Houten, an economist at Oxford Economics.</p><p>But Angela Rachidi, a senior fellow in poverty studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said the plan's child-care provisions could increase families' costs in the short term as providers make investments to comply with parts of the proposal that call for improving quality standards and wages in the industry. She added that it isn't clear if proposed subsidies would immediately cover additional costs.</p><p>How might the package affect inflation over the long term?</p><p>The Biden administration has argued that the package would offer support to families through the child tax credit to help them deal with higher prices in the short term, while reducing Americans' everyday costs over the long term by expanding the economy's capacity and making expenses such as child care and healthcare more affordable.</p><p>\"We're helping working-class and middle-class people spend less money on the things they badly need,\" Mr. Biden said in December. \"If you're worried about rising costs, nothing will cut costs for American families more than the Build Back Better plan.\"</p><p>Ms. Edelberg said while Build Back Better might have positive effects on the economy over time, such as increasing labor supply and boosting productivity, the Federal Reserve's monetary-policy decisions will have a much bigger effect on inflation's long-term trajectory.</p><p>In an acknowledgment that inflation has run hotter than expected, the Federal Reserve said in mid-December it would more quickly wind down asset purchases it has been using to support the economy during the pandemic. The move paves the way for the Fed to potentially begin lifting interest rates from near zero starting in 2022.</p><p>Write to Amara Omeokwe at amara.omeokwe@wsj.com</p><p>Manchin Rejected Biden Bill Over Inflation, Debt Concerns.
