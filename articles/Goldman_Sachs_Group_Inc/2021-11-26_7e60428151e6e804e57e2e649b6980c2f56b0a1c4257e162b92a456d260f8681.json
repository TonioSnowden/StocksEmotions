  "text": "<p>The UK competition regulator said it had <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-secures-improved-commitments-on-google-s-privacy-sandbox\">secured improved commitments</a> on customer tracking from Alphabet, Google's parent company. </p> <p>In June, The Competition and Markets Authority launched an investigation into whether Google's plan to phase out third-party cookies from its Chrome browser could harm competition in digital advertising. The search engine owner has now pledged greater transparency and engagement with the CMA, offering commitments around reducing data access.</p> <p>Andrea Coscelli, CMA chief executive, said: “We have always been clear that Google's efforts to protect users privacy cannot come at the cost of reduced competition. If accepted, the commitments we have obtained from Google become legally binding, promoting competition in digital markets, helping to protect the ability of online publishers to raise money through advertising and safeguarding users' privacy.”</p> <p><em>Share your thoughts.

The company also revealed that Lily Liu, chief financial officer, will next year move to polymers specialist <strong>Synthomer</strong> to take up the same role. </p> <p>Sofa retailer <strong>ScS</strong> warned that it had seen a reduction in store footfall and conversion over recent weeks, with consumers spending less on big ticket discretionary purchases. “This appears to be driven by a change in behaviour with consumers&#xa0;shopping earlier for Christmas when compared with previous years,” the company said. “The extended product lead times currently being experienced across the furniture and wider retail industry are also having an impact on current purchasing trends.” For the 16 weeks ending November 20, ScS reported like-for-like orders down 10.6 per cent but up 0.9 per cent versus the 2019 period. </p> <p><strong>Diageo</strong> set out plans to buy back shares up to a value of £550m as part of its previously announced pledge to return up to £4.5bn to shareholders by June 2024. The Guinness and Smirnoff maker said it had instructed Goldman Sachs to buy the stock starting today and ending no later than March 4, 2022. </p> <p><strong>Velocys</strong>, the Oxford-based aviation fuels developer, raised £25m with an overnight share placing to fund investment into reference projects and manufacturing. The Aim-quoted company placed the shares at 8p, an 8.6 per cent discount to Thursday's closing price. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>Public prosecutors in Stuttgart are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7f91fb27-9664-44f7-b276-f390b113492d\">assessing fraud allegations</a> raised by two whistleblowers at <strong>Deutsche Bahn</strong>. The FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7373c137-80ce-4a23-8257-9be3e8af0297\">on Thursday reported</a> that the state-owned German railway operator had received repeated warnings that cost inflation at the construction of Stuttgart's new railway station was caused by glaring mismanagement and suspected corruption. Prosecutors told the FT they had been unaware of the allegations and were now reviewing them.</p> <p><strong>Stocks and oil prices</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8df04124-c8e7-4c30-b4da-082ea635f308\">fell overnight</a> as global investor concern mounted over a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8ca4536-07b2-463f-bb44-8159aaec89ab\">new variant of Covid-19</a>. The sharp sell-off in equities was led by Hong Kong, where two cases of the variant were confirmed late on Thursday. The city's benchmark Hang Seng index shed as much as 2.5 per cent amid concerns that the new strain could slow the global economic recovery and further isolate the Asian financial hub, which has one of the world's most stringent quarantine systems.</p> <p><strong>French fishermen</strong> will blockade <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad4040b2-c17b-44df-b034-6bf856768f4a\">three French ports</a> and prevent freight trucks going through the Channel Tunnel on Friday to protest against the UK's failure to grant licences to some of their vessels after Brexit. Gérard Romiti, president of France's fisheries committee, described the action as a “warning shot”.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3e80afe-6efe-41ab-a301-cccccd09ee53\">effective nationalisation</a> of energy supplier Bulb shows “policy failure on a vast scale,” writes <strong>Helen Thomas</strong>. “The mistake was capping retail prices while allowing companies chasing growth at any cost to take huge amounts of commodity price risk that was in effect backstopped by the state.” </p> <p>A research recall at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a12df54-ce4d-4bca-9ca4-65ac321768de\">Finnish bank Nordea</a>, curious goings on at Aim-quoted data shop ADVFN, and star-spotting at Goldman Sachs all feature in <strong>City Insider.</strong> </p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Google makes fresh promises on customer tracking' FT.com 26 November.
