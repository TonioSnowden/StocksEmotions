  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs has agreed to buy online loans provider GreenSky for $2.2bn, as the Wall Street investment bank continues to build its presence in consumer lending.</p> <p>Goldman will pay GreenSky shareholders the equivalent of $12.11 per share in stock, a more than 50 per cent premium to the company's current share price. GreenSky shareholders will receive 0.03 of Goldman Sachs common stock per share.&#xa0;</p> <p>Shares in GreenSky, a fintech platform that provides loans for one-time expenses such as building work, surged 52 per cent.</p> <p>It is Goldman's second multibillion-dollar acquisition in under a month, highlighting the intention of chief executive David Solomon to transform Wall Street's most revered investment bank into a more consumer-focused financial institution.&#xa0;</p> <p>Goldman's asset management unit acquired NN Investment Partners,&#xa0;the asset management arm of&#xa0;Dutch insurer NN Group, for €1.6bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd064398-2030-4260-84e3-f442d42cd2d1\">last month</a> to expand the bank's presence in Europe*. The acquisition of GreenSky is the largest carried out by Solomon since he took over in 2018.</p> <p>Goldman has adopted a two-pronged strategy for its move into consumer banking. </p> <p>It launched a digital bank, Marcus, five years ago, which deals directly with clients. It has also partnered with other companies such as Apple to push financial products including credit cards. </p> <p>Solomon has been a driver of this effort since taking the helm as he has tried to reduce the bank's reliance on volatile business such as equities and bonds.&#xa0;</p> <p>“We have been clear in our aspiration for Marcus to become the consumer banking platform of the future, and the acquisition of GreenSky advances this goal,” he said.</p> <p>“GreenSky . . . will allow Marcus to reach a new and active set of merchants and customers and provide them with an expanding set of solutions.”</p> <p>GreenSky went public in 2018 at a $4bn valuation, but the company's share price has consistently traded below its $23 IPO price. It was among a number of online businesses that promised to disrupt traditional banking but have struggled to do so, hampered by rising loan defaults. The company's stock price is down almost 70 per cent since its listing.</p> <p>The merger with Goldman will allow GreenSky to bring its loans on to the bank's balance sheet, potentially lowering its funding costs. </p> <p>“GreenSky has continued to grow and done a great job but the reality is they need a balance sheet to realise their next phase of growth,” said Stephanie Cohen, Goldman's global co-head of consumer and wealth management. </p> <p>GreenSky is one of many lenders that work directly with merchants to offer financing for goods and services to help them boost sales, typically in the home improvement industry. This point-of-sale financing, or “buy now pay later”, has been growing in popularity this year, but regulators have started to crack down on the business. </p> <p>“GreenSky is a market leader in home improvement and an incredibly attractive sector to be in, in point of sale,” Cohen said. </p> <p>Atlanta-based GreenSky services a $9bn loan portfolio. Since it was founded by David Zalik in 2006, about 4m consumers have used its technology to finance $30bn worth of commerce.&#xa0;</p> <p>In July, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau fined GreenSky $2.5m for enabling merchants to take out loans on behalf of consumers without authorisation.&#xa0;</p> <p>*<em>This story has been amended since initial&#xa0;publication to clarify that the Goldman unit purchased NN Group's asset management arm.&#xa0;</em></p><p>Source: Ortenca Aliaj, James Fontanella-Khan, Imani Moise and Joshua Franklin in New York 2021 'Goldman to buy speciality lender GreenSky for $2.2bn' FT.com 15 September.
