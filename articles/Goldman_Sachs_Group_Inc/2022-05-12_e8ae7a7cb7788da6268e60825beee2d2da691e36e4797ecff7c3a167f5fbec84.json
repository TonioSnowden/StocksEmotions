  "title": "Chinese Dollar-Bond Defaults Mount as Another Large Developer Fails to Pay; Sunac China has missed an interest payment and is seeking state-owned strategic investors",
  "text": "<p>The company's international-bond default would further dampen investors' confidence in the property sector. Before this month, 17 Chinese developers with a total of $51.4 billion in hard-currency debt had defaulted since the start of 2021, according to a Goldman Sachs research report.</p><p>Sunac's fall was surprisingly swift. The 18-year-old developer had raised money from a dollar bond sale as recently as last July, a time when bond investors and global credit raters were confident about its ability to avoid the financial troubles of debt-laden peers including China Evergrande Group and Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. The two industry giants defaulted on their international debt in December after months of liquidity problems.</p><p>A resulting industrywide property downturn across China and a shutdown in bond-market financing, however, turned out to be too difficult for Sunac to navigate. Recent downgrades by international rating companies have also hindered its efforts to obtain funding, it said. Covid-19 outbreaks this year across the country, which worsened a sales slump, dealt it yet another blow.</p><p>\"The Group would like to express sincere apologies for not being able to fulfill its debt obligations as scheduled,\" Sunac said in a statement. It asked creditors to give it time to overcome its challenges. The company has appointed a unit of restructuring firm Houlihan Lokey as its financial adviser, and Sidley Austin as its legal adviser. It is trying to come up with a solution for its offshore debts.</p><p>Sunac is also working to bring in state-owned strategic investors, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>The company's dollar bonds were recently bid at around 19 cents on the dollar on Thursday morning, according to Tradeweb. Sunac hasn't published its 2021 annual results and trading for its Hong Kong-listed shares has been suspended since April 1.</p><p>Sunac was among China's five largest property developers by contracted sales over the past few years, according to CRIC, an industry-data provider. That abruptly changed in 2022, as major Chinese cities entered various forms of lockdowns.</p><p>The developer recorded the equivalent of $5.3 billion of contracted sales in March and April combined, a far cry from approximately $15.3 billion in the same two months last year. Shanghai, one of Sunac's biggest markets, is now in its sixth week of strict lockdown as central-government officials remain determined to eradicate the coronavirus.</p><p>Previously, Sunac had managed to stay afloat by moving quickly to sell assets and raise money. Since September, it has raised more than $3 billion by selling a stake in New York and Hong Kong-listed Chinese real-estate brokerage Ke Holdings Inc. and its ownership in a property-services business. It also transferred shares in unfinished property projects to state-owned developers and trusts. In November last year, Mr. Sun offered a $450 million interest-free loan to Sunac out of his own pocket.</p><p>Sunac hasn't defaulted in the Chinese domestic yuan-denominated bond market. Last month, it successfully extended the maturity of a bond that became putable on April 1 by 18 months. Mr. Sun, Sunac's chairman, offered a personal irrevocable liability guarantee for the note, meaning that if the bond defaults, creditors have the right to ask Mr. Sun to pay back the bond in full.</p><p>Sunac also has symbolic value for other Chinese private developers because of its sheer size, and some international investors had sympathized with Mr. Sun's experience living through the rise and fall of another Chinese real-estate company, before he devoted his energies to Sunac.</p><p>Additionally, some investors had previously expected Sunac to receive government help to avoid an offshore default, said Iris Chen, a credit analyst at Nomura. \"The fact that it still fell dashes the previous hope that the government will help out,\" she said.</p><p>Although the Chinese government has signaled and implemented friendly property policies to boost housing demand, such as lowering mortgage rates and down payments and relaxing some home-purchase restrictions, it will take time for these policies to flow through to developers, said Luther Chai, a senior analyst with CreditSights in Singapore.</p><p>\"Developers that have defaulted or are on the brink of default may not benefit from these easing measures, as home buyers have started to shun projects built by them, for fear that the homes may not be completed,\" Mr. Chai said. He added that the fall of Evergrande, Kaisa and Sunac shows that the government isn't trying to prevent defaults. Rather, its priority is to ensure homes are delivered to home buyers, to prevent social unrest, he said.</p><p>Write to Rebecca Feng at rebecca.feng@wsj.com</p><p>Chinese Dollar-Bond Defaults Mount as Another Large Developer Fails to Pay</p>",
