  "text": "<p>Inflation hit 8.6% in May, a 40-year high, and food and energy prices are surging. Supply-chain disruptions around the globe and the war in Ukraine further complicate the picture. Stock and bond markets are suggesting trouble ahead. The S&amp;P 500 fell into a bear market this week, down more than 20% from its recent high, and nervous investors pushed the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury to its highest level in more than a decade.</p><p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates this week to try to tamp down inflation, but higher rates aim to cool the broader economy—and no one knows for sure how quickly they would take effect and exactly what their impact would be.</p><p>\"I think this is among—if not the most—complex, dynamic environment I've ever seen in my career,\" Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President John Waldron said this month at an investor conference.</p><p>That backdrop led JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon to warn this month of economic tumult to come, though he wasn't specific about what. \"That hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way,\" Mr. Dimon said. \"We just don't know if it's a minor one or superstorm Sandy. You have to brace yourself.\"</p><p>Other executives have echoed Mr. Dimon's concern. \"It's going to be hard to avoid some kind of recession,\" Wells Fargo &amp; Co. CEO Charlie Scharf said last month at The Wall Street Journal's Future of Everything Festival.</p><p>Citigroup Inc. head Jane Fraser said last month that the U.S. might skirt a recession, but predicted that Europe is headed for one. Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said Monday that the likelihood of a U.S. recession is 50% based on historical experience, but that he is \"pretty relaxed\" about the possible impact.</p><p>Goldman CEO David Solomon said in a CNBC interview last month that the odds of a recession or weak economic growth are \"reasonable,\" which means more caution from corporate executives is warranted.</p><p>\"If you're running a significant enterprise, you have to be looking through a lens with a little bit more caution right now than you might have been when we were sitting here a year ago,\" he said.</p><p>Companies are trying to adapt. Target Corp. issued a profit warning last week after a drop in customer demand for products such as outdoor furniture and some electronics left the retailer with unwanted inventory. Microsoft Corp. recently said profit would be lighter than expected because of the strong dollar and resulting unfavorable foreign-exchange rates, a warning sign for U.S. companies that do business overseas.</p><p>Big financial firms that cater to well-off customers say shoppers are keeping up with their payments: American Express Co. CEO Stephen Squeri said this month that he expects charge-offs and delinquencies among his customers to remain below prepandemic levels through the rest of this year.</p><p>Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan said this month that spending is growing faster than inflation in all categories besides gasoline. He added that his customers still aren't talking about a possible recession.</p><p>Mr. Dimon estimated that consumers have six to nine months of spending power in their bank accounts.</p><p>Write to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com</p><p>Risk of Recession Depends on Which Banker You Ask</p>",
