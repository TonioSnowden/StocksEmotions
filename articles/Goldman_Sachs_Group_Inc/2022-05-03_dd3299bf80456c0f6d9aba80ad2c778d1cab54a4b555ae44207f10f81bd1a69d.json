  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> Boris Johnson <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6bdcc94-b30f-4a27-bf27-7b0c8c328f47\">has joined a final push</a> to convince chip designer Arm to list in London, as UK government officials grow concerned over the lasting damage if Britain's best-known tech company chooses New York for its initial public offering.</p> <h2>The Buffett show must go on</h2> <p>When <strong>Warren Buffett </strong>bid $11.6bn to buy<strong> Alleghany</strong> earlier this year, he knew he could do so without sign-off from <strong>Berkshire Hathaway</strong>'s board — a form of approval that's otherwise standard for chief executives across corporate America. </p> <p>“If Warren thinks the deal is OK, the deal is OK,” Buffett, talking about himself in the third person, said of the board's thinking as he held court over Berkshire's first in-person annual gathering since the coronavirus pandemic struck. “I could make a deal with anybody and it doesn't get all messed up with process.”&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Greg Abel</strong>, the billionaire investor's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bee2a000-75f0-48d6-8027-d2c29c50f1c9\">anointed successor</a>, won't be afforded the same luxury. </p> <p>For the loyal shareholders who make the pilgrimage to Omaha each year, Buffett's flouting of convention is part of the appeal. But the lack of a traditional corporate governance structure could soon turn into a problem once the billionaire hands over the torch, DD's Eric Platt <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/049d1084-f2eb-439b-b01e-575ef0dea525\">reports from the scene</a>.</p> <p>Abel, who is Berkshire's vice-chair and runs the company's vast collection of businesses outside insurance, was able to wander across the convention floor without being recognised as he chatted with the managers of Berkshire subsidiaries.</p> <p>Abel offered a quick handshake to media before moving on. The executive, who Buffett promoted to vice chair in 2018 alongside insurance chief <strong>Ajit Jain</strong>, has yet to draw the type of crowd as Buffett and his right-hand man <strong>Charlie Munger</strong>.</p> <p>Shareholders were left with questions after Abel left the stage, including why BNSF, a unit he oversees, had lagged behind rivals.</p> <p>“Anything tied to Abel was fumbled,” said <strong>Cole Smead</strong>, the president of <strong>Smead Capital</strong> <strong>Management</strong> — a longstanding Berkshire shareholder that has been cutting back its stake.</p> <p>There are already signs of change. Berkshire has agreed that the positions of chief executive and chair, both held by Buffett, will be split when he leaves.</p> <p>Smead worries that splitting the top job will cause Berkshire to lose steam, its strategy hinges on Buffett's ability to strike multibillion-dollar deals in a matter of days. “Part of the Berkshire strength is speed” in decision making, he said. Buffett and Munger have “a track record that gives the board confidence”.</p> <p>In the first quarter, for example, Berkshire Hathaway dipped into its massive cash pile to place multi-billion-dollar bets on oil majors <strong>Chevron</strong> and <strong>Occidental Petroleum</strong> — one of its most active quarters in recent memory. </p> <p>But few shareholders envision a future in which Abel is given the same free rein over dealmaking. </p> <p>Buffett said that his “guess” was that his successor will face a different board structure that will place greater checks on his power. </p> <p>DD ventures to guess he's correct. There can only be one Oracle of Omaha, after all.</p> <h2>Morgan Stanley puts it all on Musk&#xa0;</h2> <p>When <strong>Elon Musk</strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b49c3f4-890d-4c67-bda0-d0c8e71c3f69\"> tweeted out his grand plans</a> to take <strong>Tesla </strong>private in 2018, <strong>Morgan Stanley </strong>was eager to get in on the action.</p> <p>The Wall Street bank has financed various past ventures by Musk and had “come through” each time the billionaire's team pressed for more credit or lower rates, <strong>Jared Birchall</strong>, the head of Musk's family office and a former Morgan Stanley banker, wrote to Musk in a text. </p> <p>“That seems fair,” Musk responded.</p> <p>Birchall's appeal came one day after the billionaire entrepreneur announced he was working with<strong> Goldman Sachs</strong> and private equity group <strong>Silver Lake </strong>on the take-private deal, one that DD readers will be aware never materialised.</p> <p>Nearly four years later, however, Musk hasn't forgotten his friends at Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>The US bank is lending Musk the financing firepower he needs to see through the controversial <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb238ff0-0559-4ce2-9f15-e5ac12fdbc21\">$44bn bid</a> for Twitter, and the bank's loyalty <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/427218b5-f6c7-4287-b493-2bd299081b1c\">will be rewarded</a> in the form of lucrative fees. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley's lending relationship with Musk dates back to at least May 2011, according to regulatory filings. Top tech investment bankers at the Wall Street lender including <strong>Michael Grimes</strong> and <strong>Colin Stewart</strong> have maintained close ties to Musk going back at least to Tesla's IPO in 2010, according to one person familiar with the relationship.</p> <p>But the hundreds of millions of dollars it has lent to Musk over the years pale in comparison to what Morgan Stanley is willing to front for Musk's acquisition of Twitter. </p> <p>A person familiar with the matter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e59af9a0-11f8-4d14-804a-cdf4ca6b154d\">told DD</a> that Morgan Stanley and Japanese lender <strong>MUFG</strong>, which owns a 21 per cent stake in the US bank, has secured the green light from their credit committees to provide up to $14bn of the total $25.5bn debt package for Musk's bid if necessary.</p> <p>The commitment highlights the huge amount of risk Morgan Stanley is willing to take on as it competes for Silicon Valley's hottest initial public offerings and takeover mandates.</p> <p>The bank has been going head to head with rival Goldman to win over deep-pocketed tech clients since the dawn of the 1990s dotcom boom, and together they have taken home roughly a quarter of the $2.9bn in total fees from tech M&amp;A this year, according to<strong> Dealogic </strong>data.</p> <p>DD wonders whether Morgan Stanley's all-in backing of Musk will be enough to beat Goldman to the number-one spot this year.</p> <h2>Adler Group: nothing to see here</h2> <p>As<strong> Adler Group</strong> deals with<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2509becc-d0e8-47e0-864c-124245822bca\"> an investigation</a> by Germany's financial watchdog <strong>BaFin </strong>over potential accounting irregularities, and a short seller report, the German property group's new chair <strong>Stefan Kirsten </strong>has put on a brave face.</p> <p>A probe by a team of forensic investigators at <strong>KPMG </strong>uncovered widespread<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d49ac1b7-668f-4b86-8329-f4e9126e15b9\"> governance and compliance issues</a> last month, including evidence of “improper attempts” to influence the group's decision-making by <strong>Cevdet Caner</strong>, the Austrian property tycoon with a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17b0f7b4-a561-448e-8ad3-87ec33a804e4\">decent Dr Evil impression</a>.</p> <p>(We suggest reading <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f84a7e83-02ed-4f46-9b46-d68120a6140f\">this investigation</a> by DD's Rob Smith and the FT's Cynthia O'Murchu into the convoluted web of debt-fuelled deals involving shares in Adler from earlier this year.)</p> <p>Kirsten was quick to find a silver lining, though. KPMG's report found no evidence of “systematic enrichment at the expense of other stakeholders”, he said.</p> <p>While he did concede that Caner may have been pulling one too many strings at Adler, Kirsten argued that Caner played important roles in transactions for which he charged advisory fees, and that he was compensated appropriately for his consulting work.</p> <p>On Friday, KPMG<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bab94fc9-1d70-4d6a-93dd-642853fee677\"> refused to sign off</a> on Adler's 2021 financial results, sending shares in the scandal-plagued property group<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebd38553-50b6-4ab5-9e9d-8cd3d9a357ab\"> tumbling</a> by as much as 45 per cent on Monday.</p> <p>Adler's management “denied us access to certain information” including correspondence between related parties, said KPMG, which made it unable to conduct a comprehensive investigation. It also warned it couldn't evaluate “whether management's assessment about the valuation of certain account balances is adequate”.</p> <p>Adler went ahead and published its annual report (with a disclaimer by KPMG), &#xa0;which revealed a net loss of €1.2bn on Saturday after writing off €1bn from its property development operations. Hours later, the company's co-chief executive <strong>Maximilian Rienecker </strong>and three other board members resigned.</p> <p>Kirsten has been eager to convince shareholders that Adler's problems have been resolved, despite the resignations. He told journalists on Monday that he was assessing whether previous board members breached their fiduciary duties, and that he saw no evidence for criminally relevant misconduct.</p> <p>But KPMG's report still leaves a lot of unanswered questions regarding the convoluted web of related-party transactions surrounding Adler.</p> <p>And given that Adler withheld from KPMG 800,000 documents deemed relevant, citing “legal reasons”, it's perhaps no surprise that the auditor came up short.</p> <p>Perhaps BaFin can pick up where KPMG left off.</p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Sir Jon Thompson</strong>, head of the UK's <strong>Financial Reporting Council</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef21aaf2-28f2-442a-8d6f-e5b3ff5599f5\">is in the running</a> to become chair of the High Speed 2 rail project.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Moelis</strong> has promoted <strong>Anton Sahazizian</strong> to global head of M&amp;A. He was previously head of US M&amp;A at the bank.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Freshfields </strong>has hired private equity lawyer <strong>Rebecca Ward</strong> as a partner in its financial sponsors group.
