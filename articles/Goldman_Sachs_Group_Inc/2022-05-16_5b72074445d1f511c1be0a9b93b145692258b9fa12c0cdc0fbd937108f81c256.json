  "title": "Shanghai Takes First Step in Lockdown Exit as Tensions Rise in Beijing; Capital remains on edge over Covid-19 restrictions while daily cases in Shanghai drop below 1,000",
  "text": "<p>Nationwide, there were 1,106 new locally transmitted cases, the lowest daily count since March 10. In Beijing, which recorded 49 new cases on Monday, the government has been further tightening restrictions in a bid to stop the outbreak from taking root.</p><p>In a sign of the public tension over such control measures, dozens of students at China's prestigious Peking University protested on Sunday evening after barricades were erected without notice at an off-campus residence hall, restricting their space for movement and access to the compound's gate, according to one person who took part in the protest. One other person familiar with the matter confirmed details of the protest.</p><p>Beijing's universities all entered a so-called closed-loop system in early May, keeping students in a \"bubble\" separate from the outside world, with those living off-campus traveling to their classrooms on designated buses.</p><p>While students needed permission to leave the bubble, faculty members and their families could move around at will, the people said, even though the two groups mingled in shared spaces. After students demonstrated outside the residential building, the protest was resolved through negotiations, the people said.</p><p>\"The school has been respectful of our wishes,\" another student living in Wanliu Residence told The Wall Street Journal on Monday, adding that the mood of the students appeared calm.</p><p>Posts about the incident were quickly deleted and key search words related to the protest were blocked from Chinese social media. Peking University didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In Shanghai, meanwhile, Ms. Zong, the deputy mayor, set out concrete steps for the city's gradual reopening, after more than six weeks of lockdowns and other restrictions that have stoked widespread resentment among the city's 25 million residents.</p><p>Although supermarkets and pharmacies opened on Monday, restrictions on movement would largely remain in place until May 21, followed by a 10-day transition period, said Ms. Zong. In June, provided the risks of a resurgence in infections can be controlled, she said, \"we will fully restore normal production and life in the city.\"</p><p>All but one of Shanghai's 16 districts had eliminated the virus from the broader community, while fewer than one million people remained in closed and controlled areas of the city, the government said.</p><p>Shanghai has also been closing down the makeshift treatment and quarantine centers put up as cases surged. As of May 13, only around 50,000 people were being held in so-called fangcang facilitiesâ€”just 20% of the number at the outbreak's peak. Half of the city-level makeshift hospitals have now been closed. More than 95% of schools that had been taken over as temporary facilities are no longer being used and are now being cleaned, ready for students to return, according to the city government.</p><p>Rapidly falling cases in Shanghai offer some hope that the economy can begin to recover from the impact of China's Covid-19 controls. On Monday, government statisticians reported a drop in industrial production in April as lockdowns shut factories and disrupted logistics and supply chains. The slump in property sales also deepened, while consumers spent less. No vehicles were sold all month in Shanghai, according to the Shanghai Automobile Sales Association.</p><p>\"Although part of the Covid impact may linger for longer, we believe the worst is behind us barring reimposition of stringent, widespread lockdowns,\" Goldman Sachs analysts told clients in a research note Monday. The investment bank predicted growth would pick up in May and June as government stimulus measures kicked in.</p><p>Still, some Shanghai residents remain skeptical, pointing to the many housing compounds still locked down even after no new cases had been reported for three days or longer.</p><p>China is also investing in a new Covid-control infrastructure to replace the temporary facilities set up amid the latest outbreak, including a network of hospitals dedicated to treating the virus.</p><p>Residents of provincial capitals and cities with more than 10 million people will have a Covid testing center within a 15-minute walk, as regular testing is normalized, according to an article published in the Chinese Communist Party's main theoretical journal Qiushi, or \"Seeking Truth,\" and signed by Ma Xiaowei, the director of China's National Health Commission.</p><p>Yoko Kubota, Stella Yifan Xie and Zhao Yueling contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Sha Hua at sha.hua@wsj.com</p><p>Shanghai Takes First Step in Lockdown Exit as Tensions Rise in Beijing</p>",
