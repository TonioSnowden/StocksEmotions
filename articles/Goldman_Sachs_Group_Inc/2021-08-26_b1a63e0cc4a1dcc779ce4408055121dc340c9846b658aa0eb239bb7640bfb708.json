  "text": "<h2>Why have investors backed down on their borrowing binge?</h2> <p>Earlier this year the use of leverage became one of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79d29496-8785-4d55-af2a-8619cf99a613\">most talked-about</a> themes in financial markets.&#xa0;</p> <p>That was largely due to the implosion of <strong>Bill Hwang</strong>'s investment office, <strong>Archegos Capital Management</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The firm, it turned out, had levered itself to the hilt before one of its bets went sour and prime brokers who had done business with Hwang — no less than nine for those counting —&#xa0;were forced to unwind his book and absorb more than $10bn in losses.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/495e6a8e-7fac-4ab2-ba99-74ab9ec54b4a\">fallout from Archegos</a> prompted many prime brokers, including the few who weren't involved with Hwang, to look at how much leverage they were extending to clients. Many investors at the time feared that banks would restrict borrowing as a knee-jerk reaction.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now it appears that investors themselves are dialling back their use of leverage for the first time since the coronavirus rattled markets in March last year, according to <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/c17db619-b7a7-4501-8983-d86e90ff3721\">this report</a> by DD's Ortenca Aliaj and Eric Platt and the FT's Madison Darbyshire and Joe Rennison.&#xa0;</p> <p>Data from the <strong>Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</strong>, or Finra, Wall Street's self-regulatory body, shows that investors borrowed $844bn against their portfolios in July, down from a record $882bn in June.&#xa0;</p> <p>Separate data from <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>and interviews with several of the world's largest prime brokers show a similar trend. So what's happening?&#xa0;</p> <p>One culprit is China's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c5572f5a-d086-4ca2-995a-7b559f4e1d32\">unexpected crackdown</a> on technology stocks, which wrongfooted many investors focused on the sector.&#xa0;</p> <p>Another is the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/072615ec-93e7-4c72-aac0-ae049cb0f72a\">volatility in US equities</a> in recent weeks as economic data has broadly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8eaf88b-53f8-4b7f-a110-dcc5ad767c8c\">fallen short</a> of expectations. That has hit investor confidence in the stock market rally we've seen since April last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>The fact that many investors, including retail traders, have been buying into the market with borrowed money has raised red flags for regulators. As the collapse of Archegos showed, there are some trades that data doesn't capture: total return swaps, for example.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>It was the use of these derivatives that allowed Archegos to build up enormous stakes in a small basket of companies without drawing attention — no one really knew how much exposure the firm had.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Bank of America</strong> this week warned that declines in leverage have in the past preceded declines in the stock market, warning that the drop in margin marked a “potentially bearish peak”.</p> <p>For some people in the market, the pullback on leverage indicates that investors have simply lost faith in how markets might trade.</p> <h2>Mercedes' Formula One boss makes a winning trade</h2> <p><strong>Toto Wolff</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8708afd4-4c71-4381-bfd3-07db93f15608\">success</a> in <strong>Formula One</strong> is hard to beat. Equipped with top engineers and the racing chops of star British driver<strong> Lewis Hamilton</strong>, the boss of the <strong>Mercedes</strong> F1 team has led it to seven consecutive championships.</p> <p>Now, a different winning streak is in the spotlight: Wolff's successful trading in <strong>Aston Martin </strong>shares.&#xa0;</p> <p>Regulators have looked into suspicions of insider trading, including Wolff's purchase of a stake in the UK carmaker, the FT's Sam Agini and Joe Miller <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/243b02b8-edae-44e5-8dad-1a6a66bf154f\">report</a> — though they haven't found evidence to proceed with an investigation.</p> <p>Here's what happened: Wolff bought less than 1 per cent of Aston Martin in April last year after the Canadian billionaire <strong>Lawrence Stroll </strong>stepped in with a consortium to rescue the then-struggling British company.&#xa0;</p> <p>He bought the shares from a vehicle controlled by Stroll, who also owns the Aston Martin-branded F1 racing outfit that competes against Wolff's Mercedes on the track.&#xa0;</p> <p>The month after the stock purchase, Aston Martin named <strong>Tobias Moers</strong>, the former head of Mercedes' high-performance <strong>AMG</strong> business, as its chief executive. In October the German carmaker <strong>Daimler</strong>, the parent company of Mercedes, said it would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1abfa75b-1d31-455a-9e43-9bfef1d06844\">increase</a> its Aston Martin stake from less than 5 per cent to 20 per cent.</p> <p>Shares in Aston Martin have risen by about two-thirds since April last year. Wolff's stake is now worth almost £14m, according to <strong>S&amp;P Global Intelligence</strong>.</p> <p>Neither Germany's financial watchdog <strong>BaFin </strong>nor the UK's<strong> Financial Conduct Authority</strong> found evidence of wrongdoing or proceeded with an investigation. Mercedes F1 said Wolff had not been aware of either move when he bought the shares and had made “all relevant disclosures” to UK financial authorities.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's a reminder that F1 is a close-knit sport, with tight connections between its most senior figures. Wolff may be an insider in that world, but regulators appear to have decided there's nothing wrong with his trade.</p> <h2>OnlyFans: back to business as usual</h2> <p>Yesterday DD <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8d76469-97b4-4230-a553-53f1026068c6\">delved into</a> <strong>OnlyFans</strong>' <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/216c8f47-153c-4d0d-8f01-c46abf06b9c0\">sudden decision</a> to ban sexually explicit content, a surprising move considering the platform's vast community of adult content creators who helped to propel its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d4562f8-166f-4a89-a3cb-db97123a6cf0\">explosive growth</a> during the pandemic.</p> <p>But a lot can happen in 24 hours.</p> <p>Just a day after company's chief <strong>Tim Stokely </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b8ce71c-a87a-440e-9f3d-58069ca0480b\">told</a> the FT's Patricia Nilsson that the ban on porn had come in response to “unfair” treatment by banks, OnlyFans has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5468f11b-cb98-4f72-8fb2-63b9623b7b2b\">reversed the ban</a>, saying that it had “secured assurances” from its banking partners to allow X-rated content to continue.</p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OnlyFans/status/1430499277302816773\">https://twitter.com/OnlyFans/status/1430499277302816773</a> <p>Stokely, who told Patricia that he'd happily welcome sex workers back if the banking environment were to change, appears to have stuck to his word.</p> <p>The question that remains is how OnlyFans' financial partners have pledged to adjust their policies to accommodate the platform's adult creators.&#xa0;</p> <p>Stokely specifically called out <strong>Bank of New York Mellon</strong> for having “flagged and rejected” every wire connected to the company, as well as UK-based <strong>Metro Bank</strong> for closing OnlyFans' corporate account on short notice in 2019.&#xa0;</p> <p>As the FT's Lex column <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f985874-ce7d-43c6-af95-ca6a2860df2b\">points out</a>, OnlyFans would struggle to justify its 20 per cent cut of creators' earnings if the audience lured to the platform's adult content were to leave. Mainstream content providers could migrate to other mediums such as<strong> Instagram</strong>, which don't take a slice of their revenues.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Tad Rivelle</strong>, chief investment officer for fixed income at the Los Angeles-based asset manager <strong>TCW</strong>, will <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tcws-bond-investing-chief-tad-rivelle-to-step-down-11629911648?mod=hp_lista_pos5\">retire from the firm</a> at the end of the year, says The Wall Street Journal.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Morrison &amp; Foerster</strong> has hired <strong>Hogene Choi</strong> as a partner in its patent strategy and prosecution group. She joins the firm's Palo Alto office from<strong> Baker Botts</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Standard Chartered Private Bank</strong> has appointed<strong> Lawrence Goh </strong>as managing director and deputy market head for south-east and southern Asia, based in Singapore. He was previously head for Malaysia and Singapore markets at <strong>Bank of Singapore</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Sebastian Schwarzenegger</strong> has joined <strong>Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management </strong>as executive director for Germany and Austria, based in Frankfurt. He previously worked at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>The Theranos effect</strong> Female founders, particularly in the science and biotechnology space, still find themselves unfairly likened to Elizabeth Holmes, the infamous entrepreneur who is preparing for a fraud trial.
