  "title": "World News: Two Senior U.K. Cabinet Members Quit --- Treasury chief, health secretary resign, challenging Johnson's ability to stay in power",
  "text": "<p>In his resignation letter, Mr. Sunak said the public expects the government to be \"conducted properly, competently and seriously.\" Mr. Javid in his letter said he could \"no longer in good conscience\" continue serving in the government.</p><p>Several other Tory lawmakers demanded Mr. Johnson quit. An official close to the prime minister said Mr. Johnson won't quit. Instead he moved to reorganize his cabinet, appointing education secretary Nadhim Zahawi as treasury chief.</p><p>The catalyst for the resignations is the culmination of a series of scandals -- notably over parties held in Downing Street during Covid-19 lockdowns -- and growing unease in the ruling Conservative Party about both Mr. Johnson's conduct in office and how he will manage a snowballing economic crisis. Inflation rose to 9.1% last month, its highest level in 40 years.</p><p>Mr. Johnson's future as prime minister looks extremely uncertain. Increasingly deprived of political capital, he is struggling to hold together a voter base that spans traditional fiscal conservatives and the blue-collar workers who voted for the Tories for the first time in the last election. Mr. Johnson is under growing pressure from some Tory lawmakers to announce tax cuts to help people with a cost-of-living crisis, but economists warn tax cuts could fuel further inflation.</p><p>Last month, Mr. Johnson survived a no-confidence vote held by the Conservative Party in which 41% of his lawmakers voted to oust him, a surprisingly large number. That challenge was brought about in part after Mr. Johnson was fined by police for attending his birthday party during a Covid lockdown and after assuring lawmakers that no parties had taken place in Downing Street.</p><p>After the vote, Mr. Johnson promised lawmakers that he would ensure his Downing Street operations were no longer plagued by scandal. However just this week Mr. Johnson apologized after a senior lawmaker in his party quit for allegedly groping two men.</p><p>\"After all the sleaze, the scandals and the failure, it's clear that this government is now collapsing,\" said opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer.</p><p>On paper, Mr. Johnson enters this battle for political survival from a position of relative strength. He presides over a large majority in Parliament, and under Conservative Party rules there can't be another leadership challenge for a year. The next general election doesn't have to be held until early 2025. However, rebels in his party are considering forcing a change to the Conservative Party rules so that another leadership challenge can be held sooner, according to people close to them.</p><p>Mr. Johnson -- who repeatedly has proved to be a political Houdini -- could choose to tough it out and refuse to quit, analysts say. It could take months of rolling rebellions and a further confidence vote to oust him. The lack of an obvious Tory successor makes his hand stronger, analysts say.</p><p>On Tuesday evening several cabinet members, including Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, expressed support for Mr. Johnson. Steve Barclay, a former Brexit minister, was named health secretary. Mr. Zahawi, an Iraqi-born lawmaker who previously founded a successful polling company, is now running the treasury.</p><p>Mr. Zahawi likely will come under pressure from Conservatives to reverse a planned increase in corporate tax scheduled for next year. With Mr. Johnson's political authority undermined, analysts see him agreeing to tax cuts.</p><p>Much depends on whether Conservative lawmakers believe that Mr. Johnson's reputation as a vote-winning machine persists. The recent loss of two special elections, which saw Tory districts vote for opposition parties, has tarnished it. On Tuesday a poll by YouGov showed that 54% of people who voted Conservative in the 2019 election say Mr. Johnson should quit.</p><p>The loss of Mr. Sunak, a former Goldman Sachs banker who is among those tipped to replace Mr. Johnson, is a particular blow as the country enters a period of deep economic uncertainty. In his resignation letter, Mr. Sunak said a low-tax, high-growth economy could be delivered only \"if we are prepared to work hard, make sacrifices and take difficult decisions.\"</p><p>Mr. Javid's resignation was less of a surprise. The health secretary had been pushed out by Mr. Johnson as treasury chief. He returned during the pandemic after the previous health secretary was filmed kissing an aide.</p>",
