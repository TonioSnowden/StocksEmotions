  "text": "<p>BlackRock has raised Rmb6.7bn ($1bn) for its first mutual fund in China, as the world's biggest asset manager presses ahead with its expansion into the country's lucrative savings market despite concerns over the political climate.</p> <p>The US company, which became the first global group to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5bb13be2-68da-4e53-8d32-5340b67ef82f\">gain approval</a> for a wholly owned Chinese mutual fund business in June, said it closed fundraising a week earlier than expected and brought in more than 110,000 investors.</p> <p>BlackRock's move is part of a wider push by international finance into China's rapidly growing $19tn asset management market, even in the face of rising <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d5e09db3-549e-4a0b-8dbf-e499d0606df4\">geopolitical tensions</a> with the US.</p> <p>But its latest announcement came after a dramatic recent shift in tone from Beijing, where President Xi Jinping's administration is seeking to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bacf9b6a-326b-4aa9-a8f6-2456921e61ec\">tighten the Chinese Communist party's grip</a> over industries from tech to education and has unveiled a “common prosperity” drive to redistribute wealth.</p> <p>A regulatory crackdown on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/deac99c5-502e-4432-8450-495fcc6619e2\">Didi Chuxing</a> in July hit the ride-hailing company's shares days after its $4.4bn initial public offering in New York, while a ban on for-profit tutoring wiped billions off the value of US-listed Chinese education groups.</p> <p>News that BlackRock had completed its fundraising came one day after George Soros, the billionaire financier, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrock-larry-fink-china-hkex-sse-authoritarianism-xi-jinping-term-limits-human-rights-ant-didi-global-national-security-11630938728\">wrote in The Wall Street Journal</a> that the asset manager's move into China was a “tragic mistake”.</p> <p>Soros specifically cited the launch of its mutual fund business and warned that the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8761f611-5619-4c2d-8627-577ba9359cd4\">common prosperity programme</a> “does not augur well for foreign investors”.</p> <p>“Xi regards all Chinese companies as instruments of a one-party state,” Soros wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ecf7de34-e595-4814-9cbd-4a5119187330\">column for the Financial Times</a> last week, warning that investors in China would face “a rude awakening”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c0a3292-d3ff-428b-937c-1edde19294d2\">Rachel Lord</a>, who was appointed BlackRock's head of Asia-Pacific this year and will oversee the group's expansion in China, said in a statement that the asset manager was “excited to be able to contribute our investment and risk management expertise to help make investing easier and more affordable for Chinese investors”.</p> <p>The recent imposition of social and commercial restrictions in China, including on video gaming, has coincided with a long-term liberalisation of the country's financial system, reflected in Beijing's willingness to allow foreign companies to fully own mutual fund businesses. In the past, asset managers were forced to co-operate with a local joint venture partner.</p> <p>The regulatory interventions have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb3c0ee7-2ddb-48d2-8b58-9700dfbaadbd\">raised fears over listings</a> of Chinese companies in the US, which operate through depositary receipts. Most of BlackRock's $19bn stake in Alibaba's American depositary receipts were converted to its Hong Kong shares in June as a result of a change to the way an MSCI index incorporated the Chinese ecommerce group.</p> <p>As well as its mutual fund business, BlackRock received approval in May for a majority-owned <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3fd79007-e556-4f04-aa6e-43557652890f\">wealth management business</a> in partnership with China Construction Bank and Temasek, Singapore's state fund. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs unveiled a joint venture the same month with Chinese lender ICBC in wealth management, a sector in which foreign participants are seen as one way of improving standards.</p> <p>When it announced the mutual fund launch, which caters to onshore investors, in August, BlackRock said it would “seek long-term capital appreciation via a total returns strategy that takes a long-term investing approach, backed by in-depth research into individual stocks and stringent risk management controls”.</p><p>Source: Thomas Hale in Hong Kong 2021 'BlackRock raises $1bn for first foreign-run China mutual fund' FT.com 8 September.
