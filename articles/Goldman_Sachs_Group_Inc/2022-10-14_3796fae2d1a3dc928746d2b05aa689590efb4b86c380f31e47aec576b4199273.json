  "text": "<p>The stakes have never been higher for Peloton Interactive Chief Executive Barry McCarthy. He has to hope his efforts don't go from good, to better to bust.</p><p>An Oct. 6 Wall Street Journal article based on an interview with Mr. McCarthy suggested he was giving Peloton about six more months to prove itself as a viable stand-alone company. Mr. McCarthy later clarified that there is \"no timeclock nipping at our heels,\" adding that if his comments to the Journal suggested there could be, then he misspoke.</p><p>After a whirlwind of business changes since he took the helm in February, Mr. McCarthy's current goals suggest the company continues to face near-term pressure. He is targeting break-even cash flow by the end of June after burning more than $2.3 billion in the previous fiscal year. And, despite the fact that Peloton has logged six straight quarterly losses, including a $1.2 billion loss in the most recent quarter, he is now setting his sights on growth.</p><p>So far, not so good, third party data suggest. Citing Similarweb data, a Morgan Stanley analysis shows that, after Peloton's web traffic declined 41% year on year for its June quarter, traffic again decelerated on that basis in September, down 34% to \"the lowest absolute traffic level since the start of Covid.\" Especially concerning, according to analyst Lauren Schenk, is that such metrics buck the usual seasonal trends for the business, with September traffic showing sequential declines for the first time.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Will the Peloton rowing machine fit into your exercise routine? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Meanwhile, data from M Science shows subscriber churn reaccelerated in September after improving in August. Citing weakness across connected fitness gross adds and churn, the firm is expecting a net loss of 7,000 connected fitness subscribers for the period ended Sept. 30 on a sequential basis. The company's guidance had suggested no change.</p><p>Under Mr. McCarthy, a Netflix and Spotify alumnus, Peloton has been shifting away from its expensive hardware roots toward higher margin subscription revenue. But, as the company works to expand beyond its initial affluent customer base, he has introduced a bundled subscription plan that includes both content and hardware for one affordable price.</p><p>At a Goldman Sachs conference last month, Mr. McCarthy said he was \"over the moon, excited\" about the potential for this so-called \"fitness-as-a-service\" offering, but said he worries about it initially being profitable. Referring to the bundle as a potential \"device of mass destruction,\" he said he is nervous it will be a product that everyone wants but \"the economics are going to blow us up\" because the offering can't immediately earn money.</p><p>The solution for that, meanwhile, seems to be a continued reliance on Peloton's premium hardware to make up the difference. Its rower, which became available just last month for preorder, is priced at nearly $3,200 with no financing available—more than twice the cost of its lower-priced bike and nearly as much as its treadmill. It is part of Mr. McCarthy's \"good, better, best\" strategy which he believes can help expand Peloton's market size by servicing the gamut of customers from the cost-conscious to those for whom money is no object. Peloton controls more than 70% of the shrinking premium connected fitness market.</p><p>Can the rower reignite the premium market's love affair with connected fitness? Its rich price amid a worsening economic backdrop suggests failure isn't an option. YipitData shows the rower's preorders contributed about 30% of Peloton's gross connected fitness product orders in September, noting its initial contribution as a percentage of total orders has been more substantial than its latest treadmill launch was last year.</p><p>Similarweb data, though, suggest that excitement was only temporary. Worldwide daily desktop visits to Peloton's rower pages spiked Sept. 20 (the day preorders became available) to nearly 37,000 but had dwindled to well under 1,000 by Oct. 8. With its digital app, bundled subscriptions, and new availability through outside channels like Amazon and Dick's stores, Peloton has been brought to the masses. That doesn't make every customer equally valuable to its business, though.</p><p>The way Peloton gets mocked in popular culture reflects the shift in mood. Past appearances include HBO Max's Sex and the City reboot (\"And just like that…Big died\") Netflix's Emily in Paris (\"Why would anyone want this…you don't go anywhere\") and The Family Guy (\"Name one cool person who rides a bike\"). A Simpsons episode this month shows Marge toiling at self-assembly of her new \"Pedalon\" bike, only to hear her instructor declare in her first class, \"I care about all of you. Except for the woman on the bottom left [of the screen]. Your credit card was declined.\"</p><p>Investors might want to start that timeclock after all.</p><p>Write to Laura Forman at laura.forman@wsj.com</p><p>Peloton Rows for Broke</p>",
