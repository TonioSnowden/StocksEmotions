  "title": "MSCI Keeps Emerging-Market Rating on South Korea, Despite Push for Upgrade; Index provider had recently highlighted various issues with market access",
  "text": "<p>In one recent concession to global investors, South Korea overhauled its currency market, which has been tightly controlled since the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. Earlier this month Seoul said it would extend onshore foreign-exchange trading to 17 hours a day, from 6Â½ at present.</p><p>MSCI made no mention of South Korea when it announced the results of its annual market-classification review, in a statement issued late Thursday. It said it would consult investors on downgrading Nigeria from frontier-market status to a so-called stand-alone market.</p><p>The index company reviews world markets every year, assessing how large, liquid and readily accessible to foreign investors they are. In the case of South Korea, MSCI recently highlighted several shortcomings in market accessibility. These included gaps in English-language corporate disclosure, curbs on foreign-exchange trading and a partial ban on short selling, or betting against stocks.</p><p>In just a few decades, South Korea has risen to become one of the world's most advanced economies, with a roughly $2 trillion stock market that is home to companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Motor Co.</p><p>In 2020, South Korea had the world's 10th largest economy in dollar terms, according to World Bank figures. China, the largest emerging market, ranks second on this list.</p><p>The last country to secure developed-market status from MSCI was Israel in 2010.</p><p>MSCI previously removed South Korea from a review list for a potential upgrade in 2014, while FTSE Group, another index provider that is now known as FTSE Russell, upgraded South Korea in 2009.</p><p>Goldman Sachs analysts have estimated an MSCI upgrade could trigger more than $44 billion in foreign inflows, as investors who track developed markets indexes add South Korean stocks to their holdings.</p><p>The U.S. bank says South Korea has recorded more than $14 billion in foreign outflows this year through mid-June. As of late morning Friday in Seoul, the benchmark Kospi Composite was down about 21% so far this year, amid a global market selloff.</p><p>However, an upgrade would have turned South Korea from one of the most important locales for investors in developing countries into just one of many developed markets. South Korean stocks made up nearly 13% of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index as of end-May.</p><p>As a developed market, South Korea's index weight could have been sufficiently small \"that it can now be ignored,\" said Jihong Min, portfolio manager for T. Rowe Price's Asian Opportunities Equity Strategy. Corporate governance and dividend yields, two areas in which South Korea companies score poorly compared with developed market rivals, could add to that risk, Mr. Min said in an email.</p><p>Write to Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com</p><p>MSCI Keeps Emerging-Market Rating on South Korea, Despite Push for Upgrade</p>",
