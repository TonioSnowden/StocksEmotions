The agreement could potentially end Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year reign as prime minister of the Jewish state. There is a sense that things might finally be shifting in Israel, writes international affairs editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1772e7c9-947a-442f-9b7c-86a88649d859\">David Gardner</a>.</p> <p><strong>Biden to rebuke Putin over hack of meat processor JBS</strong> Joe Biden will rebuke Vladimir Putin over the&#xa0;cyber attack on JBS, the world's biggest meat processor, when the two presidents meet later this month. The US does not rule out retaliating against the perpetrator it suspects is a Russian criminal gang, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95c62ed2-52de-4631-a58e-92333d0a8c1f\">the White House said on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p><strong>US wields $2bn tariff threat over digital taxes </strong>The US has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/17f08416-e3aa-48bf-9de0-468cec9c5554\">threatened to slap tariffs on $2bn</a> worth of goods from the UK and five other countries as they argue about how to tax technology companies, a move that risks reigniting transatlantic trade wars unless parties resolve thorny talks over a broader international tax agreement. </p> <p><strong>Trafigura warned Credit Suisse over Gupta invoice </strong>The commodities trader warned Credit Suisse last year that its supply-chain finance funds appeared to contain <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25fdb537-adf2-4c82-ad6d-7421898e4b7c\">a suspicious invoice</a> from industrialist Sanjeev Gupta's business empire, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions. </p> <p><strong>Google boosts Android privacy protections </strong>Google is <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/ff67e5a6-ca3e-42d2-98b8-01e656a6d396\">strengthening privacy protections</a> for Android users who want to make it harder for advertisers to track them when they move between apps, as the company tries to counter Apple's image as a better steward of personal data.</p> <p><strong>Spac promoter Chamath</strong> <strong>Palihapitiya to target biotech companies</strong> The billionaire investor and former Facebook executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f227b773-752a-4b43-b5e3-5c9777c3453a\">is planning to raise $800m</a> for four cash shells that will target biotechnology businesses. The four new Spacs will all use ticker names beginning “DNA” in a partnership with Kishen Mehta, a healthcare-focused portfolio manager at Suvretta Capital Management.</p> <h2>The day ahead</h2> <p><strong>Employment data</strong> The ADP national employment report is expected to show&#xa0;private payrolls&#xa0;rose 650,000 in May, after surging by 742,000 in April.&#xa0;The US Labor Department is expected to release&#xa0;initial jobless claims&#xa0;data for the week ended May 29 — it is likely to have risen 390,000. European stocks <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c50c6152-8789-4a20-9c51-402cfcc3a165\">wavered</a> ahead of the data release.</p> <p><strong>Broadcom results</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/5232c038-84ed-4eca-96f1-cbb078327c07\">semiconductor maker</a>&#xa0;is expected to post a rise in second-quarter revenue, as growing 5G technology adoption increased demand for its chips.</p> <p><strong>G7 health ministers meet </strong>Ahead of next week's G7 summit, the UK is hosting <a href=\"https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/events/g7-summit-what-next-future-global-health\">a meeting of health ministers</a> to discuss the global response to the pandemic and distribution of vaccines.</p> <p><strong>St Petersburg forum </strong>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b41c1847-5911-4869-970f-f0df74cd3e51\">annual gathering</a> was once a regular date for US and European executives, officials and heads of state, but lately it has become a barometer of Russia's soured relations with the west as the list of high-profile foreign attendees shrinks.</p> <h2>What else we're reading</h2> <p><strong>How the US used car market is driving inflation </strong>Unusually, officials are watching <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/70491b2f-6b6c-4489-ae14-706ed835c423\">used car prices</a> closely as an indicator for the future path of inflation. If the price rises spread into other parts of the economy, the US could face a prolonged period of overheating for the first time in decades, posing a challenge for the Federal Reserve and policymakers.</p> <p><strong>The giant-killer stalking Wall Street</strong> With just 22 employees and $240m worth of assets under management, Engine No 1, went up against the mightiest oil company in the US and won three seats on its board, with a mandate to prepare it for a future free of fossil fuel. But as US energy editor Derek Brower and M&amp;A correspondent Ortenca Aliaj explain, Engine No 1 is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebfdf67d-cbce-40a5-bb29-d361377dea7a\">no fly-by-night outfit</a>.</p> <p><strong>The Englishman trying to save US bookstores from Amazon </strong>The future of the precious <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b943e6c1-f899-4fa4-b0d4-1b60cf51e5d0\">bookstore experience</a> is far from assured in the age of Amazon, eBooks and the pervasive strain on physical retailers. A great deal depends on the benign dictator of English-language bookstores, James Daunt. His toughest task: tempting Americans back into Barnes &amp; Noble. </p> <p><strong>Silicon Valley bets to disrupt traditional finance</strong> In the past year the fastest-growing cryptocurrency start-ups have been those aiming to abolish financial intermediaries — <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/0f179c8d-aa60-41d4-96d7-5d53e78c3514\">such as Uniswap</a> — bringing along a new crop of venture capitalists and producing returns that are the envy of more conservative peers.</p> <p><strong>How Mali fell from grace </strong>Just a decade ago, Mali was held up as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/869864e1-7797-42b1-a32b-a5c7a829ee5b\">paragon of democratic virtue</a>, following the 1991 coup that overthrew dictator Moussa Traoré. But the African Union's suspension of the country this week provided official, if belated, recognition that a democracy once heralded as a shining example in west Africa is on the ropes.</p> <p><strong>Put the BBC behind a paywall overseas </strong>Funding negotiations are a perennial struggle for the BBC, but the current one has an intriguing twist. It may determine how overseas viewers will bankroll it. Alex Barker asks: will the broadcaster have the firepower to reinvent itself as a streaming service that can attract <a href=\"http://ft.com/content/2ff9516d-4f29-4615-87de-41f3262feb52\">tens of millions of subscribers outside Britain</a>?</p> <h2>Cartoon of the day </h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95c62ed2-52de-4631-a58e-92333d0a8c1f\">Biden to rebuke Putin over hack of meat processor JBS</a></p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Jennifer Creery and Emily Goldberg 2021 'FirstFT: Today's top stories' FT.com 3 June.
