  "title": "Goldman Sachs Has the Recipe for Long-Term Gains; Bank's huge returns in deal making might not be sustainable forever, but across-the-board improvements to its overall business bode well",
  "text": "<p>That is huge for the bottom line, because it is a highly efficient business needing relatively little capital and having big operating leverage. The investment-banking unit's return on average common equity was a huge 70% annualized in the third quarter. Overall, Goldman Sachs had a nearly 23% annualized return on equity in the third quarterâ€”way above the medium-term target of 13% that the bank has set for itself.</p><p>Yet surely at some point in this economic cycle, companies and private-equity firms will stop making acquisitions at such a breakneck pace. The advisory business is well known to be lumpy and highly cyclical. The question then for investors is whether other businesses can continue to operate at a high level or even improve, to help ensure that the bank remains on track to sustainably match or beat its hurdles in a somewhat more normalized world.</p><p>The bank's global markets unit was operating at a roughly 19% return level in the third quarter, also well above the stated target for that business. Trading desks have benefited from market-share gains among big clients and improvements in capital efficiency that could keep that result elevated. So it is reasonable that the unit might stay relatively high for some time, even if not quite at this level as market activity somewhat normalizes.</p><p>Asset management remains something of a moving target, since its results can vary with the market performance of the bank's investment positions. But overall, the direction of travel should be toward durably higher returns as the bank sells down assets and frees up capital, at the same time increasing fees for managing assets via third-party funds it is raising. The bank said it has \"line of sight\" on further asset sales that would free up $2 billion in capital, for example.</p><p>Consumer banking and wealth management, where the bank is investing to be a bigger player over a longer time horizon, is still a drag on overall return on equity at about a 7% level. Investors may have varying views on how quickly that business evolves.</p><p>There is also the denominator of returns: how much equity the firm has to hold. There is some pressure on that front. The bank said that some revisions led to an increase in the risk-weighted measures of its assets, which shrank the bank's equity capital ratio cushion against its requirements. Many banks are also in the process of adopting new rules about how to measure counterparty credit risk, which Goldman said could result in a small additional drag on its capital ratio. Over time, though, the bank's shifting of assets from its balance sheet to third party funds should lower the stress-based capital requirements imposed by the Federal Reserve, which would lead to a bigger cushion and increase the potential for equity return.</p><p>Goldman Sachs shares jumped more than 2% on the earnings, but they are still trading at around 1.5 times tangible book value, about a percentage point below Morgan Stanley, and even a couple of ticks below where S&amp;P 500 banks overall trade. That gives shareholders plenty of potential upside if the market can be further convinced that Goldman's underlying return potential has made a meaningful jump behind the noise of recent wild quarters.</p><p>Given other banks' heavy reliance on external factors like rates and loan demand, buying Goldman shares might be one more deal worth making.</p><p>Goldman Sachs Has the Recipe for Long-Term Gains</p>",
