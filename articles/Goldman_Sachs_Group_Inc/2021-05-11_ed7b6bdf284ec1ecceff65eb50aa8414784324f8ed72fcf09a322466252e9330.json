  "text": "<p>Shares in THG, formerly the Hut Group, surged as much as 15 per cent on Tuesday as investors digested news of a $1bn equity issue and a wide-ranging investment and co-operation agreement with a unit of Japan's SoftBank. </p> <p>The Manchester-based ecommerce group announced on Monday evening that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0edb7c17-58e6-4ded-acfa-1822440a926c\">SB Northstar</a>, a division of SoftBank that invests in public equities, would invest $730m as part of the placing, giving it a stake of roughly 8 per cent. </p> <p>Another $320m of stock was sold to institutions, up from an earlier target of $270m because of strong demand, taking the total issue size to $1.05bn, or just under 10 per cent of the existing share capital.</p> <p>THG shares were trading at around 673p in early trade, up 13 per cent from the 596p placing price and 35 per cent above the 500p price of the group's initial public offering in September.</p> <p>The company also agreed to grant SB Northstar a call option to acquire a 19.9 per cent stake in THG Ingenuity, a division that provides integrated ecommerce and logistics services for groups such as DIY retailer Homebase and consumer products group Nestlé, for $1.6bn.</p> <p>The option does not oblige SoftBank to make the investment. THG has agreed to examine ways to legally separate Ingenuity from the rest of the business within 15 months.</p> <p>The option price implies an equity value of $6bn for the unit, equivalent to more than three-fifths of THG's market capitalisation, even though Ingenuity generated less than a tenth of group revenues in the past financial year.</p> <p>James Grzinic at Jefferies said the SoftBank option “provided a powerful external validation of Ingenuity's attractions”, while Wayne Brown at Liberum said it implied THG's other businesses, mostly direct-to-consumer ecommerce operations in health and beauty and nutrition, were worth £2.7bn. </p> <p>However, Clive Black at Shore Capital said there was a large element of “smoke and mirrors” surrounding the transaction, and THG in general, which he described as “very worrying”.</p> <p>“There is a real problem around the lack of visibility on the underlying business performance at THG,” he said. “It is a buy-and-build operation and there seems to be a low level of stress-testing on the cash and capital returns of all these acquisitions.”</p> <p>THG said the proceeds of the placing, which come after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06b3022b-b891-4642-9048-3ac2683b828c\">it raised $1.2bn </a>through the sale of new shares during IPO, would be used to “execute an advanced pipeline of strategic M&amp;A”. </p> <p>At its full-year results in March, THG said it would increase spending on M&amp;A this year, given the opportunities available. It said it was in “advanced discussions” with another beauty brand, which it declined to name. </p> <p>It has agreed to acquire Bentley Laboratories, a New Jersey-based prestige beauty manufacturer, for $255m, the latest in a series of bolt-on acquisitions designed to bolster its health and nutrition businesses. </p> <p>The stake of THG co-founder and chief executive Matthew Moulding will be diluted as a result of the placing, but he retains a “special share” that gives him the power to veto any hostile takeover approach for the group. </p> <p>Barclays, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Jefferies acted as co-ordinators and bookrunners on the placing while Rothschild was financial adviser to THG.</p><p>Source: Jonathan Eley 2021 'THG shares jump on SoftBank investment' FT.com 11 May.
