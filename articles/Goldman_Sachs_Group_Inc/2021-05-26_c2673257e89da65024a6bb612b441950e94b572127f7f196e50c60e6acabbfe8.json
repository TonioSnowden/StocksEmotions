  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Goldman Sets Wealth Tie-Up in China  ----  By Clarence Leong and Jing Yang",
  "text": "<p>   Chinese regulators have approved a wealth-management joint venture between Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China Ltd., as China further opens up its lucrative financial sector to foreign banks. </p><p>   Goldman's asset-management arm will own 51% of the venture, and the remainder will be held by an ICBC wealth-management subsidiary, the New York-based bank said Tuesday. </p><p>   ICBC, one of China's largest state-owned banks, said the venture will help it provide more diversified and professional wealth-management services and would improve the bank's ability to serve the real economy. </p><p>   In China, wealth-management businesses run by banks typically sell investment products to a range of individuals. Goldman on Tuesday cited its own research estimating that investible assets held by Chinese households could surpass $70 trillion by 2030. About 60% of that total could be allocated to nondeposit products including securities, mutual funds and wealth-management products, the firm said. </p><p>   Goldman said the new venture has received preliminary approval from the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, and it intends to develop a range of investment products for the China market. </p><p>   That would include \"quantitative investment strategies, cross-border products and innovative solutions in alternatives,\" Goldman said. </p><p>   Goldman has sought to expand its presence in the world's second-largest economy. Last December, it applied to take full control of Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Co. by acquiring the 49% share of the venture it didn't own. Goldman Sachs was the first global bank to seek full ownership of its securities business in China. </p><p>   Other global financial firms have also been moving to expand wealth-management offerings in China, which for years placed ownership restrictions on foreign financial institutions. A January 2020 trade pact between Washington and Beijing promised greater access to China's financial sector for American institutions. </p><p>   In March this year, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. agreed to pay $410 million for a minority stake in a leading wealth-management business owned by China Merchants Bank. That deal marked the first time a Chinese bank has opened up its wealth-management subsidiary to a foreign strategic investor. J.P. Morgan Asset Management is separately awaiting approval to take full ownership of its fund management joint venture in China. </p><p>   Earlier this month, BlackRock Inc., the world's largest money manager, received a green light from China's banking regulator to commence a wealth management joint venture with a unit of the state-owned China Construction Bank and Singapore's investment company Temasek. BlackRock is separately preparing to start selling mutual funds to individual investors in China, via a wholly owned business there. </p><p></p>",
