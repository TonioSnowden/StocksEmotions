The only problem is that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/64d00862-c892-46e2-bef5-6e85bfc65948\">clients aren't buying in</a>.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the Swiss lender <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b55174ee-540a-4c60-8474-40c560b123fa\">forecast a SFr1.5bn ($1.6bn) pre-tax loss</a> for the final quarter of the year as wealthy clients withdrew up to 10 per cent of assets since the start of October. It was its fourth profit warning since January.</p> <p>The pullback from wealthy clients is particularly painful because its wealth management unit was supposed to be part of its “new core”, according to the plan carved out by its new chief <strong>Ulrich “Uli the Knife” Körner</strong>.</p> <p>The results did little to instil confidence among investors around its restructuring plan. Credit Suisse shares fell by more than 6 per cent, trading at their lowest level on record since 1975.</p> <p>“The massive net outflows in wealth management — Credit Suisse's core business alongside the Swiss bank — are deeply concerning, even more so as they have not yet reversed,” said <strong>Vontobel </strong>analyst<strong> Andreas Venditti</strong>.</p> <p>Credit Suisse's sweeping restructuring plan had begun to ruffle feathers even before the recent results. The deal with SNB, whose largest shareholder is Saudi Arabia's<strong> Public Investment Fund</strong>, was poorly received.</p> <p>“It's very painful to give 10 per cent of the bank away for just SFr1.5bn,” one top-10 shareholder in the group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f6e0084-0db0-46d6-b20f-7c0840a3d061\">told the FT last month</a>, as the nickname <a href=\"https://insideparadeplatz.ch/2022/10/27/credit-suisse-wird-credit-saudi/\">“Credit Saudi”</a> began to make the rounds in Zurich.</p> <h1>Return of the Mack: ‘I don't fucking care'</h1> <p><strong>John Mack</strong> is back. The two-time <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> boss, whose job cutting sprees earned him the nickname “Mack the Knife”, is out with a new memoir <em>Up Close And All In</em>. </p> <p>In it, he recounts his journey as a second-generation Lebanese immigrant from Mooresville, North Carolina, to lead one of Wall Street's biggest investment banks. It ends on the melancholic disclosure that he was recently diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, which could be the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.</p> <p>Some critics have poked fun at the memoir's self-aggrandisement and a lack of reflection by Mack over his role in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis. Mack, now 78, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7896b7b6-95b8-4ca1-8445-f5cfec478e65\">was typically defiant</a>: “I gotta be honest with you, I don't fucking care, alright? You think I care?” he told the FT's Josh Franklin and Brooke Masters. “If people think I have a big ego, I did have a big ego. I don't care.”</p> <p>Pressed on his role in the 2008 crisis when he was running Morgan Stanley — his bank was saved by a $9bn cash injection by <strong>MUFG </strong>and took $10bn in government bailout money — Mack blamed bad decisions on the competitive pressures at the time.</p> <p>“After declining a lot of chances to put risk on the books, we came to the conclusion it's time to step up and show that we are in business, we will take risk. At the end of the day, I would argue we got lucky and smart and it worked out,” he said.</p> <p>Regardless of the causes, Mack argued the industry has learned valuable lessons from the crisis. </p> <p>“The culture of just making money is the wrong culture,” he said. “Maybe 25 years from now it'll all dissipate and it'll go back to, ‘Let's take risk and make as much money as we can'. But I think boards are more inquisitive. I think risk committees are more robust.”</p> <h1>FT readers sound off on the Orpea debt crisis</h1> <p>Sometimes when your trusty FT reporters publish a story, something magic happens — the discussion in the comment section brings expertise and arguments that go way beyond what the story was able to delve into. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d49e0f70-df72-45da-b8c8-26ce9e299a4d\">That's what happened under Leila Abboud's column</a> on the travails of French nursing home group Orpea where FT readers debated the merits of the company's efforts to restructure its €9.5bn debt pile. </p> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/labboudles/status/1595433216588013575?s=20&amp;t=sPUQ7Fynqh0lRVk1TnA7Ig&#xa0;\">https://twitter.com/labboudles/status/1595433216588013575?s=20&amp;t=sPUQ7Fynqh0lRVk1TnA7Ig&#xa0;</a> <p>On one side was a reader who slammed Orpea for doing an about-face from a June plan to cut debt by refinancing a bunch of loans and selling off real estate assets, only to opt in October for a more radical debt-to-equity swap that would effectively wipe out shareholders. On the other was a reader who thought that tack was the right one, even if very harsh on shareholders.</p> <p>A similar debate is also raging in Paris where a battalion of lawyers for the creditors and shareholders are seeking to influence the direction of Orpea's ongoing debt restructuring talks. While all that crunchy detail didn't fit in the column, FT readers took it to the next level in the comments. </p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>California Public Employees' Retirement System</strong> has named<strong> Anton Orlich</strong>, the former head of alternative investments at healthcare group<strong> Kaiser Permanente</strong>, as head of private equity.
