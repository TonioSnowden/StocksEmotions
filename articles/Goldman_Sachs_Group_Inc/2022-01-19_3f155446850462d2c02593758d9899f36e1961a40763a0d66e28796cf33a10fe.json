  "text": "<p>Good morning and welcome to Europe Express.</p> <p>As is customary halfway through its five-year term, the <strong>European parliament</strong> yesterday reshuffled its leadership, electing Malta's centre-right lawmaker Roberta Metsola as its president — along with more than a dozen vice-presidents. We'll take stock of how the EU institution, which prides itself on being its only directly elected body, has fared so far and why its waning influence may be difficult to restore.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Brussels, after two days of meetings among EU finance ministers, a few broad areas of consensus on potential reforms to the bloc's <strong>fiscal rules</strong> are starting to emerge. But the devil still lurks in the yet-to-be-defined details.</p> <p>And in <strong>transparency</strong> news, a fresh fight is brewing over what constitutes official communication, as the European Commission is routinely rejecting calls for the release of instant messages exchanged, for instance, between Ursula von der Leyen and the chief executive of Pfizer.</p> <h2>Midterm blues</h2> <p>The European parliament's class of 2019 is that dog that never barked, writes <em><strong>Mehreen Khan in Strasbourg. </strong></em></p> <p>Fears over the troublemaking capacity of a historically <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9733a232-7fe1-11e9-b592-5fe435b57a3b\">fractured</a> parliament, the end of a longstanding left-right grand coalition and the arrival of a sizeable batch of unruly new MEPs are all but a distant memory. </p> <p>For all the early hype, for the last two-and-a-half years the European parliament has failed to flex its muscles on key EU policy areas, ceding more ground to a dominant EU Council. </p> <p>The high-water mark of parliamentary influence came at the start of the new electoral mandate in the summer of 2019, when MEPs ditched three of Ursula von der Leyen's commissioner candidates — the most spectacular of which was the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c66ce36-eb58-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55\">defenestration</a> of France's Sylvie Goulard. But MEPs early flexing was not a sign of things to come. </p> <p>The pandemic is partly to blame. Unlike with rival institutions in the council and its member state diplomats (known as Coreper), Covid-19 lockdowns forced MEPs to conduct much of their business online, cancelling plenary sessions and disrupting committee meetings that are the bread and butter of legislative dealmaking. </p> <p>Pandemic-induced institutional weakness has combined with other factors, including the absence of commanding group leaders and standout MEPs, to help consign the EP to a marginal role. &#xa0;</p> <p>The parliament has lost major battles to the council, including a failure to secure a legislative role in the governance of the EU's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03d72613-1745-4520-9ba3-5a94c8a3963f\">historical leap</a> into joint borrowing in the form of the pandemic recovery fund. MEPs have tirelessly banged the drum on the rule of law, but ultimately ended up with an ambiguous conditionality mechanism whose fate is being decided in the EU's highest court. The parliament's <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/former_ep_presidents/president-sassoli/en/newsroom/parliament-files-lawsuit-against-commission-over-rule-of-law-mechanism.html\">decision</a> to sue the commission for not wielding the tool against Hungary and Poland has had little impact on von der Leyen's calculations so far.</p> <p>MEPs are now trying to shake off their midterm blues by reviving some much-needed political co-operation inside the house. The three main groups made up of the centre right, socialists and liberals have agreed a “common statement” laying out their priorities for the next 2.5 years. It coincides with the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8ef05a2-c2d2-4ba3-a225-b26918992ff1\">election</a> of the new parliament president, conservative&#xa0;Roberta Metsola, who will boast a bumper cross-party majority. </p> <p>Manfred Weber, veteran leader of the European People's party, hopes the midterm will be a fresh start for the class of 2019. He wants strengthened group co-operation and Metsola's appointment to help reestablish the parliament's “visibility”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The next 2.5 years will be the true test of the parliament's institutional heft. MEPs will go toe-to-toe with member states in marathon negotiations over standout legislation such as the Green Deal. Major institutional questions, such as how to appoint the next commission president, will also need to be determined. It might only then be that the legacy of the class of 2019 will be decided. </p> <h1>Chart du jour: Oil boom</h1> <p><em>Oil prices surpassed a seven-year high yesterday, threatening to fuel a further rise in global inflation, on bets that demand for crude could outstrip supply later this year. Goldman Sachs expects oil inventories across OECD countries to reach their lowest levels since 2000 by the middle of the year, pushing the price past the $100 mark by 2023. (</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70f58398-8911-45d3-b1b0-cc16c4ac184d\"><em>More here</em></a><em>)</em></p> <h2>Fiscal rules saga, continued</h2> <p>Emerging from two days of meetings, EU commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis yesterday declared he could spy some early areas of “broad agreement” over reforms to the EU's budget rules, writes <em><strong>Sam Fleming in Brussels.</strong></em> </p> <p>For his part, Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, described discussions on the topic as “serene”, with a striking convergence of views. </p> <p>There is, however, a big difference between uncovering patches of common ground and the complex job of hammering out a detailed and coherent set of reforms that can command the support of the member states. </p> <p>France's president Emmanuel Macron, allied with Italy's Mario Draghi, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ecbdd1ad-fcb0-4908-a29a-5a3e14185966\">set forth</a> a particularly ambitious agenda, seeking to embed incentives for a broad range of public investment into the Stability and Growth Pact. Such innovations have typically been viewed sceptically in the more frugal north of the EU. </p> <p>The position of Christian Lindner, the new German finance minister, will be critical. Describing himself as a “friendly hawk”, the liberal member of the German coalition placed notably heavy emphasis both on the importance of reducing public debt and on fighting inflation. </p> <p>He also observed that the Stability and Growth Pact has proven its flexibility in its current, unchanged form, which is not a point that advocates of far-reaching reform like to emphasise.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the position of the Netherlands — the traditional standard-bearer for frugality — remains unclear. The Netherlands is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/126f589c-9fff-41d0-bdd0-1cdf082bff86\">boosting</a> public investment and has in its new finance minister, Sigrid Kaag, an enthusiast for European engagement. But it is too soon to say what that will mean when it comes to detailed changes to the SGP. </p> <p>So where does Dombrovskis see signs of a consensus? </p> <p>The commission executive vice-president said member states want to simplify the framework, move away from hard-to-measure indicators such as output gaps and take a fresh look at the overly draconian debt rule that requires indebtedness to be reduced by a 20th of the distance from the EU's 60 per cent objective every year. Debt reduction should be growth-friendly and gradual, and leave room for “high quality” public investments. </p> <p>For his part, Le Maire dismissed as urban myth the idea that he and his German counterpart are on different pages when it comes to the need to tackle public debt. The two ministers “share the same desire to find a new balance” in the EU's fiscal rules between investment and consolidating government finances, said Le Maire.</p> <p>What remains entirely unclear at this stage of discussions is exactly where this “new balance” actually lies. Striking it will be one of the most politically difficult tasks on the EU's 2022 agenda.</p> <h2>Burn after reading</h2> <p>Remember the texts that commission president Ursula von der Leyen <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cea5e3f-d4c4-4ee2-961a-3aa150f388ec\">exchanged</a> with Pfizer boss Albert Bourla last year when trying to secure doses of its vaccine? The commission would rather you did not, writes <em><strong>Andy Bounds in Brussels. </strong></em></p> <p>After German magazine Der Spiegel was denied access to them in November, Dutch MEP Sophie in t'Veld asked why they could not be released. Vera Jourova, commissioner for transparency, replied yesterday to say such messages were not covered by document-keeping rules.</p> <p>“Due to their shortlived and ephemeral nature, text and instant messages are not meant to contain important information in relation to policies, activities and decisions of the Commission,” Jourova <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SophieintVeld/status/1483380669187346432\">said</a>. They are deleted after six months unless saved as an email or in another format.</p> <p>But Jourova may not have the last word. </p> <p>The EU ombudsman Emily O'Reilly, who polices the institutions' compliance with regulations, is compiling a report into the matter after a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FantaAlexx/status/1483399157050220547\">complaint</a> by Alexander Fanta, a journalist at Netzpolitik.org, a German-language news website. She has already <a href=\"https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/en/press-release/en/149154\">demanded</a> the regulation, produced in 2001, be modernised to cover messages. </p> <p>If O'Reilly calls on the commission to produce the texts it would have to choose whether to comply or ride out a wave of criticism from MEPs and transparency activists. That's if they have not yet been deleted.</p> <h1>What to watch today </h1> <ol>  <li><p>French president Emmanuel Macron speaks in the European parliament</p></li>  <li><p>US secretary of state Antony Blinken meets Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv</p></li> </ol> <h1>Notable, Quotable </h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>German complacency:</strong> German lenders are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e554582c-dedc-4368-af9f-05a628f4dd8d\">becoming too complacent</a> about the risk of borrowers defaulting and the potential for interest rates to rise, the deputy head of its central bank has warned in an interview with the Financial Times. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Strong Omicron:</strong> A fourth dose of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is largely ineffective <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58cfd452-a85e-4235-8849-0f4a3c89ffc8\">in stopping Omicron</a> infections despite measurably boosting antibodies, an Israeli hospital study showed.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Deloitte in trouble: </strong>Deloitte is facing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/475e29d5-0eae-4ab9-99ec-3c16ddd9b87a\">allegations of serious misconduct</a> in its German business, after a former executive claimed it had ignored sexual harassment allegations against senior staff and defrauded Volkswagen by overbilling for Dieselgate-related work. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Three-year extension: </strong>Brussels is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7bacef7c-60ac-4c0c-94df-a544fb9109d4\">planning</a> to extend its temporary permit allowing European banks and fund managers to use UK clearing houses until June 2025.
