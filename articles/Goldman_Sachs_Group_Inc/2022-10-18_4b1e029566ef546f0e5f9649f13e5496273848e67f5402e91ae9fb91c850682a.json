  "title": "Reaching Consumers the Goldman Way; A realigning of reporting units emphasizes that the firm aims to keep adding deposits and loans, even if it won't be doing it the same way",
  "text": "<p>Such a reporting structure will be familiar to anyone who follows other big banks. But Goldman will also create a unit called Platform Solutions. This combines corporate transaction banking with its credit-card partnerships with Apple and General Motors, and its acquired GreenSky home-improvement loan business. That is the part that might require some explanation.</p><p>Goldman's long-term aim is to take advantage of its core Wall Street business serving the biggest corporate and institutional clients to generate strong returns in other businesses, including in lending. In asset-and-wealth management, it can take the pressure off its own capital by moving away from direct investments and toward raising money from outside investors. Meanwhile, it can use its banking license to replace expensive wholesale funding with lower-cost deposits, and add high-return assets such as credit-card loans.</p><p>These are the kinds of banking and investing businesses that generally win higher earnings multiples from the street. Goldman's forward price/earnings multiple has averaged over nine times over the past five years, versus 12 times for JPMorgan Chase and just under 11 times for Morgan Stanley, according to FactSet data. BlackRock averaged closer to 18 times.</p><p>A lot about this strategy is already working. Goldman now has nearly $400 billion of total deposits. Net interest income in the third quarter was more than $2 billion, up almost 18% from the second to third quarter. The firm has raised over $160 billion for alternative assets toward its $225 billion goal.</p><p>What wasn't working as well was trying to go directly to the consumer. Acquiring customers by marketing Marcus savings accounts broadly is expensive. That is no surprise with the number of bank and fintech players chasing \"neobanking\" opportunities. Gathering loans via cards was also proving tricky: With the Apple Card, Goldman said it was seeing more customers than anticipated who use cards mainly to transact and pay down debts quickly, meaning that loan balances weren't reaching the levels envisioned.</p><p>What the new reporting lines emphasize is that in banking, Goldman is going to focus more on relationships with its existing corporate and wealth clients. That includes its wealth relationship with big companies' employees. Along those same lines, the platform unit can be understood as a new vehicle for gathering deposits and assets.</p><p>It can generate corporate deposits and financing via transaction-banking software. It can generate consumer loans or deposits by helping clients such as Apple or General Motors use its card technology to attract and retain customers. For instance, it recently introduced a high-yield savings account for Apple Card rewards users. Goldman now employs 11,000 engineers; maybe they can accomplish what tellers and branches did in the past.</p><p>Banks all have their own mix for the business of taking money in and lending it out. They are ultimately measured similarly: Goldman's deposits grew 1% from the second to third quarter, while many others saw theirs shrink. On the asset-and-wealth management side, it saw positive net inflows into assets-under-supervision. It will need to continue to show progress on those metrics, as well as its fundraising and fee goals.</p><p>Whether that is all called Marcus or something else, Goldman's success extending its core strengths in investment banking will be key to judging the success of its new strategy.</p><p>Write to Telis Demos at Telis.Demos@wsj.com</p><p>Reaching Consumers the Goldman Way</p>",
