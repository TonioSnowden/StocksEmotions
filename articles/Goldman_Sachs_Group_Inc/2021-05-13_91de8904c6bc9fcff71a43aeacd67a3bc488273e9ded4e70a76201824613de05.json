  "text": "<p>Mario Draghi has waived his €115,000 salary as Italy's prime minister as he attempts to lead his country out of a health and economic crisis.</p> <p>A declaration of Draghi's earnings, taxes and assets, published by the Italian government, stated that he would not receive “any remuneration of any kind” during his time in office.</p> <p>Draghi, a former president of the European Central Bank, was sworn in to lead a national unity government earlier this year after Italy's previous coalition collapsed during the Covid-19 pandemic. He has since launched an ambitious €248bn package of investments and structural reforms to help reboot Italy's pandemic-hit economy.</p> <p>The decision to sacrifice his prime ministerial salary is intended to strike a chord in a country where the high salaries and perks of lawmakers have been frequently attacked by populist parties as a symbol of an out of touch political elite.</p> <p>Draghi, 73, is already able to draw upon large state pensions from his previous roles as head of the Bank of Italy and director-general of the Italian treasury.</p> <p>His most recent income tax return, published on Wednesday as part of the government's transparency policies, revealed he earned €583,665 in 2019. His assets include 10 properties, nine of which are in Italy and one in London.</p> <p>Draghi earned an annual salary of €401,400 as president of the European Central Bank, according to the ECB's annual report, the same as his successor Christine Lagarde. Before leading the ECB, Draghi worked as a managing director at Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>Draghi's income for 2019 compares with nearly €1.2m in earnings declared by his predecessor Giuseppe Conte in 2018, the year he was appointed prime minister. Conte, who previously worked as a law professor and private lawyer, opted to receive 80 per cent of the €115,000 he was entitled to as Italian prime minister.</p> <p>Previous Italian prime ministers who did not receive a salary did so because they were also lawmakers, unlike Draghi, which blocked them from being paid for both roles.</p> <p>Mario Monti, a former European Commissioner who led a technocratic Italian government between 2011 and 2013, also chose to give up his salary when he was appointed a life senator.</p> <p>Italy's politicians are <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2013/09/02/italian-members-of-parliament-are-paid-substantially-higher-salaries-than-those-in-other-west-european-countries/\">among the highest paid in Europe</a>. The Five Star Movement, now part of the Draghi unity coalition, became Italy's largest party at its last general election in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1a7352bc-3bf2-11e8-b7e0-52972418fec4\">stating that “the age of privilege is over”.</a></p> <p>In 2020, Italians voted 69.6 per cent in favour of a referendum to reduce the number of MPs in parliament from 630 to 400, and the number of senators from 315 to 200. </p> <p>As a technocratic appointment, Draghi is not expected to seek re-election when Italy holds its next general election by 2023 at the latest.</p><p>Source: Miles Johnson in Rome 2021 'Mario Draghi waives his salary as Italy's PM' FT.com 13 May.
