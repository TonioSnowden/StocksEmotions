  "text": "<p>\"The second quarter so far has been brutal for IPOs, as rising interest rates have an especially large impact on the intrinsic valuations of growth stocks,' said Matthew Kennedy, analyst at Renaissance Capital, a provider of pre-IPO research and IPO-focused ETFs. \"The dramatic fall in prices is also tied to excessive valuations we saw last year. So stocks have had further to fall.\"</p><p>Fed chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said the central bank was not likely to hike its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points at its next meeting, a comment that immediately sent stocks higher and the dollar DXY and Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y lower. His comments came after the Fed raised interest rates by 50 basis points as expected.</p><p>But Powell was hardly dovish, all but promising consecutive 50-basis-point rate hikes, and saying it would take a cooling in red-hot inflation or a deteriorating jobs market for the Fed to slow down the pace of rate increases, and even then only by 25 basis point increments.</p><p>Yields rose again Thursday, with the 10-year Treasury note yield BX:TMUBMUSD10Y above 3.06% or its highest level since 2018. That sent stocks sharply lower with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA shedding more than 1,100 points and the Nasdaq Composite COMP down more than 600 points.</p><p>\"We don't expect things to pick up over the next month, especially after today,\" said Kennedy. \"Instead, at this point in the cycle we typically see only a handful of deals are able to price. If those do well, and if the broader market cooperates, we'd then expect to see some tech unicorns launch IPOs. But that could be months away. \"</p><p>See now: Piano maker Steinway is going public again: 5 things to know ahead of its IPO</p><p>The IPO market was expecting eyecare company Bausch + Lomb BLCO to price its planned deal later in the day. The company set terms last week of 35 million shares priced at $21 to $24 each, to raise up to $840 million and mark the second biggest deal of the year so far.</p><p>With 350.0 million shares expected to be outstanding after the offering, the company would be valued at $8.4 billion at the top end of the price range.</p><p>The company is being spun out of healthcare company Bausch Health Inc. BHC and will list on the New York Stock Exchange and TSX under the ticker \"BLCO,\" unless underwriters, a group of 20 banks led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs balk at today's market performance and postpone the deal.</p><p>Kennedy noted that parent Bausch Health has lost nearly 20% of its value since terms were set, so the IPO could end up pricing below range.</p><p>\"No matter what happens, we are looking at Bausch + Lomb as an important test for the IPO market,\" he said. \"Beyond that, energy services company ProFrac is expected to list next week; the energy sector is one of the few bright spots of the 2022 IPO market.\"</p><p>IPO ETF slides 8% amid market carnage ahead of expected Bausch + Lomb pricing</p>",
