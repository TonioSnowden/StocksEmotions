  "text": "<p><strong>One media job move to start: Axel Springer</strong>, the <strong>KKR</strong>-backed new German owner of <strong>Politico</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0159f7e-13cb-44a5-9771-d0eeb42b45f3\">has ousted the editor</a> of Europe's largest newspaper<strong> Bild</strong> after accusing him of continuing to mix his “private and professional affairs” and giving false statements to the publisher's board.</p> <p>The departure of <strong>Julian Reichelt</strong>, the 41-year-old editor of the controversial German tabloid, comes a day after The New York Times reported <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/17/business/media/axel-springer-bild-julian-reichelt.html\">fresh details</a> of an earlier investigation into alleged misconduct that exonerated him. &#xa0;</p> <h2>From barbarians to corporate emperors</h2> <p>A few years after <strong>KKR</strong> sealed its famed $25bn acquisition of the crackers-to-cigarettes empire <strong>RJR Nabisco</strong>, two professors at Harvard Business School set out to understand a new type of financial firm whose multibillion-dollar leveraged buyouts were shaking up corporate America.</p> <p>The academics,<strong> George Baker</strong> and <strong>Cynthia Montgomery</strong>, reached a <a href=\"https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/10-024.pdf\">provocative conclusion</a>. Private equity firms, or “LBO associations”, as the professors quaintly called them, have:</p> <blockquote>  <p>“ . . . come to resemble the very conglomerates they were supposed to be disassembling. By the end of the decade, the largest LBO associations controlled firms with sales of many billions of dollars, and would have been, if considered a single firm, among the largest and most diversified firms in the country.”</p> </blockquote> <p>That was in 1994, when KKR managed only a fraction of the $429bn of assets now at the firm's disposal. <strong>Henry Kravis</strong> and <strong>George Roberts</strong> didn't yet rank as billionaires, according to that year's Forbes list of the richest Americans.</p> <p>Now, if the mosaic of assets managed by the firm's private markets division were folded into one entity and listed on the stock market, its market capitalisation could exceed $100bn — comparable to industrial giants such as <strong>General Electric</strong>, <strong>Lockheed Martin</strong> or <strong>3M</strong>.</p> <p>In other words, DD's Mark Vandevelde writes in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c56a7da-6435-469c-90d8-28e966f20379\">this FT Big Read</a>, it would resemble in many ways the empire-building projects of mid-20th century corporate America that KKR did more than most to demolish.</p> <p>Will 40 years of conquest by the private capital tycoons likewise end in a humiliating debacle? </p> <p>True, the private equity model undoubtedly imposes discipline on executives and eliminates much of the ego-driven decision making that led to the demise of RJR Nabisco and its peers.</p> <p>But with $4tn in assets, private equity is now operating at untested scale, while confronting the unprecedented twin challenges of post-Covid supply constraints and resurgent consumer demand.</p> <p>A lot is riding on Wall Street's claim to have built a leaner, fitter version of conglomerate capitalism. This is a moment when the way companies are run may shape not only private fortunes but also national destinies.</p> <h2>THG: golden share loses its shine&#xa0;</h2> <p>What do you do when investors lose confidence in your business model and your share price is in free fall?</p> <p>For <strong>THG</strong>, the Manchester-based online seller of make-up and protein powder, the answer was to try to win back some investor confidence by announcing governing changes.</p> <p>On Monday the beleaguered UK company said the golden share granted to its chief executive <strong>Matthew Moulding</strong> — which gives him an effective veto over hostile takeovers — will expire at some unspecified date next year, rather than in 2023. (The FT's Bryce Elder also informs us that Moulding <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4413f5d5-d113-4d69-94ac-d00e7707097e\">has sadly locked</a> his entertaining Instagram account.)</p> <p>Shares recovered some of their losses in response but remain 56 per cent lower from the start of the year. </p> <p>The FT's Helen Thomas was unimpressed. It “feels like window dressing around the gaping hole left by the evaporation of the market's confidence in THG's business,” she <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b0e5aba-593b-4a74-8985-6ea7e716b5a5\">writes</a>. </p> <p>You might recall that THG is the company <strong>SoftBank</strong>'s <strong>Akshay Naheta</strong> engineered a complicated bet on in May.</p> <p>What did Naheta see in the cash-burning company formerly known as <strong>The Hut Group</strong>, which happens to have its own content production facility from which to record <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b88d9d9-1ee4-496c-ba8b-342659401401\">speeches complaining about short sellers</a>? </p> <p>Alongside Helen, DD's Rob Smith and Kaye Wiggins asked that question in this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7466fff9-d827-4902-8e9f-4b61a26201a7\">deeply-reported piece</a>. </p> <p>SoftBank invested $730m in THG in May, and also acquired an option to buy a 19.9 per cent stake in its Ingenuity unit for $1.6bn. The deal gave THG 15 months to spin off the unit, and for the Japanese investor to decide whether to use the option. </p> <p>Moulding told investors in May that he anticipated the complex deal “going through in six months' time”. Last week management said the deal should close in the first half of 2022. </p> <p>But a SoftBank executive told the FT in the wake of last week's sell-off: “I don't know why analysts are assuming anything about the option being mandatory. It never was.”</p> <h2>Mo Money, Mo Problems (feat. Harvard and Yale) </h2> <p>DD had been wondering for a while when some of America's largest endowments were going to release their performance figures. </p> <p>The multi-week delay from five of the most elite universities in the US prompted some to question whether the schools had simply made too much money and were wary of posting their results in light of the difficulties experienced by their students during the pandemic. </p> <p>On Thursday we found out that the endowments of <strong>Harvard</strong>, <strong>Yale</strong>, <strong>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</strong>, <strong>Cornell</strong> and <strong>Brown</strong> had collectively become almost $40bn richer. </p> <p>With $53.2bn in assets, Harvard's endowment is the largest in the US, but rival Yale is closing the gap with outperformance. </p> <p>Yale, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a42e730-0d43-402f-afb8-c11bb30e5838\">now directed</a> by<strong> Matthew Mendelsohn</strong> after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e43825e7-7824-4355-881b-cb11629cd070\">the death</a> of <strong>David Swensen</strong>, earned 40.2 per cent, putting the endowment at $42.3bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Returns varied with Harvard on the low end, posting a 33.6 per cent gain and MIT at the high end with a 55.5 per cent return. </p> <p>Booming markets, particularly in private equity and venture capital, have propelled the gains, as DD's Antoine Gara and Miles Kruppa <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb63caee-44d4-47f5-bdfd-ef18511973ee\">report</a>. </p> <p>It's a dramatic turn from 2020, when college campuses were closed due to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus\">coronavirus pandemic</a> and reported budget deficits. </p> <p>Millions in emergency Covid-19 relief money was earmarked for schools like Harvard and Yale but the aid created controversy because of their large endowments.</p> <p>Harvard eventually returned $8.6m in relief funding, while other well-endowed schools like <strong>Princeton</strong> refused to accept it. </p> <p>A year later, skyrocketing financial markets are creating a new publicity problem. Endowments are growing so big that universities have to figure out how to dole out the riches, while not allowing spending to run out of control, before a backlash mounts on campus.</p> <p>MIT will increase its endowment payout by 30 per cent from 3.1 per cent to 4.2 per cent — an estimated $286m increase to $1.1bn starting in June. </p> <p>Harvard increased distributions from its endowment by 2.5 per cent of total assets in April. In the past fiscal year it distributed $2bn, or about 2 per cent of overall assets.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Harvard isn't getting carried away. </p> <p>“Contrary to popular perception, the university does not have unlimited wealth,” said chief financial officer Thomas Hollister in an <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/10/university-reports-budget-surplus-despite-pandemic-challenges/\">interview</a>.</p> <h2>Job moves&#xa0;</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> has named <strong>Roger Ferguson</strong>, the former president and chief executive of financial services company <strong>TIAA</strong>, as vice-chair. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Paul Weiss</strong> has hired <strong>Andre Bouchard</strong>, former chancellor of the <strong>Delaware Court of Chancery</strong>, as a partner in its litigation department.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong>'s head of gas and renewable energy <strong>Maarten Wetselaar</strong> <a href=\"https://on.ft.com/3FJqpLH\">is leaving the business</a> after 25 years, the latest shake-up in the teams leading the transition towards cleaner fuels at Europe's energy majors.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Citigroup</strong> has recruited <strong>Sumit Khedekar</strong> as head of healthcare for the Americas within its banking, capital markets and advisory group, based in New York. He was previously Americas head of healthcare for <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>Missed connections </strong>LinkedIn, the last major western social network in China, has pulled the plug in response to Beijing's crackdown on technology.
