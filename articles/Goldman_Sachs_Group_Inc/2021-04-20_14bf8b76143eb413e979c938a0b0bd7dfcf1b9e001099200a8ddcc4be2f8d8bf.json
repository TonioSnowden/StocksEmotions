Was it <strong>Moderna</strong>? <strong>Pfizer</strong>? Maybe <strong>Johnson &amp; Johnson</strong>?&#xa0;</p> <p>One name you're unlikely to hear is <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong>. The British drugmaker is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/657b123a-78ba-4fba-b18e-23c07e313331\">notably absent</a> in the race to bring a Covid-19 vaccine to market. Its struggles have fed broader concerns surrounding the company, its drug pipeline and most crucially, its leadership.&#xa0;</p> <p>The attention over GSK's bare cupboard is increasingly falling on the shoulders of <strong>Emma Walmsley</strong>, its chief executive since 2017.&#xa0;</p> <p>Murmurs of discontent among shareholders about her lack of a scientific background have seeped out and now one of the most feared activist investors on Wall Street has put itself in a position to do something about it.&#xa0;</p> <p>The FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1d64eff-7cfb-4f73-9a48-45857640f9a9\">revealed</a> last week that hedge fund <strong>Elliott Management </strong>had quietly built a multibillion pound stake in GSK.&#xa0;</p> <p>The news may have come as a surprise to most of the drugmaker's employees, but investors appeared to be relieved.&#xa0;</p> <p>Shares in GSK, which had fallen 14 per cent since Walmsley took over, rose 6 per cent after Elliott's stake was revealed.&#xa0;</p> <p>It may have seemed that Walmsley had pre-empted an activist shake-up by announcing in 2018 that she would break up GSK — spinning off its consumer health business to allow it to focus on delivering “breakthrough medicines”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Yet as the split looms, shareholders fear that the company has little to show for it.</p> <p>The group's recent reinvestment in oncology — a lucrative market where novel drugs can fetch high prices and trials are shorter — has hit several speed bumps, from scrapped trials to delayed approvals.</p> <p>It's difficult to know whether GSK's lagging R&amp;D productivity is bad luck or poor planning, but Elliott is not leaving anything to chance.&#xa0;</p> <p>DD believes the activist fund is likely to push for the sale of GSK's consumer health business ahead of the planned demerger. But it is unlikely to stop there.&#xa0;</p> <p>After several years in charge, Walmsley's destiny and that of GSK itself may now be linked to how well she gets along with her newest shareholder.&#xa0;</p> <p>Read our latest deep-dive on GSK <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f135e584-bda2-47ad-a414-38346abaec04\">here</a>.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Jammin' like crazy at Goldman</h2> <p>Is <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> more imposing than ever?&#xa0;</p> <p>Over the past couple of years, Wall Street's shiniest brand seemed to collect a bunch of scuff marks.&#xa0;</p> <p>First was the fallout from the 1MDB scandal. At one point, chief executive <strong>David Solomon</strong> apologised directly to the people of Malaysia for the bank's role in the multi-billionaire dollar looting of the nation's sovereign wealth fund. (Solomon and other executives had some of their pay clawed back and Goldman settled with the <strong>US</strong> <strong>Department of Justice</strong> for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c570376-a02f-4550-8304-8e61943f9782\">$2.9bn</a>.)</p> <p>Add to that a number of high-level departures and overworked junior bankers drafting pitch books filled with their grievances, and Goldman's glory days seemed to be a distant memory. Maybe not.&#xa0;</p> <p>Last week, Goldman <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5082365e-ccb3-437d-86bf-4255412c7c73\">announced</a> an extraordinary 31 per cent annualised return on equity in the first quarter.&#xa0;</p> <p>And conditions couldn't have been more perfect: bankers were busy with record activity level driven by Spacs as risk managers kept <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/495e6a8e-7fac-4ab2-ba99-74ab9ec54b4a\"><strong>Archegos</strong> losses</a> off its books.&#xa0;</p> <p>Its arch-rival <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b589c3f5-9175-4572-bb7e-02ad17e414c1\">would disclose a $1bn hit</a> from its prime brokerage relationship with <strong>Bill Hwang</strong>'s family office.</p> <p>In 2006, the peak of the pre-crisis rollicking era of Wall Street banking, Goldman delivered a similar 33 per cent ROE. But that came with a balance sheet levered at 23:1, almost double what Goldman carries in today's more conservative era.&#xa0;</p> <p>The upshot: Goldman's core business, leverage aside, has perhaps had its greatest quarter ever. It even brings memories of one of our favourite pieces of content from 15 years ago: “<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2006-05-11/jammin-like-crazy-at-goldmanbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice\">Jammin' like crazy at Goldman</a>”.</p> <p><strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0595526e-48fa-48ff-a594-d219f15b54a4\">had the second highest ROE</a> at 23 per cent, which though impressive, was hurt by low interest rates that continue to plague its core lending businesses.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley, which would have otherwise looked back on the first quarter as one of its best, will now bear the black mark of Archegos for at least another quarter.</p> <h2>Anthony Tan Grabs for Gold</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41b26841-b88d-4f9d-9da2-b1b8f2c6c734\"><strong>Anthony Tan</strong></a> has never been shy about going for what he wants.</p> <p>Just two years after founding <strong>Grab</strong>, his <strong>Uber</strong>-like taxi service, he was already unabashedly ambitious. “If we get this right, we can literally go into the history books,” the entrepreneur, a scion of one of Malaysia's wealthiest families, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dbe630f2-f61b-11e3-a038-00144feabdc0\">declared in 2014</a>.</p> <p>And in his latest display of confidence, Tan plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e23cd61-1a8d-4dc5-aba1-8565fce31882\">dramatically increase</a> his control over Grab when it joins <strong>Nasdaq</strong> via a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a44185aa-51f4-443a-895f-16dd853e1d77\">$40bn Spac deal</a> later this year. The transaction has awarded him 60.4 per cent of voting power despite having an equity stake of just 2.2 per cent, thanks to a dual class share structure.</p> <p>If the amount of control in the hands of one man seems aggressive, that's because it is.&#xa0;</p> <p>Such an overriding majority voting right for a chief executive was “unprecedented” for a company seeking a Spac route, one lawyer told the FT's Mercedes Ruehl.&#xa0;</p> <p>Even for companies that have gone public the traditional way it is high, according to an FT analysis. For some, however, Tan's level of power over the company won't come as a surprise.&#xa0;</p> <p>That would be none other than<strong> Gojek</strong>, Grab's longtime rival in south-east Asia. Both companies held merger talks last year — coerced by shareholders aghast by the cash they were burning through competing against each other — but the discussions fell apart in December.&#xa0;</p> <p>The reason? According to several people close to the negotiations, Tan wanted certain assurances about his position, demanding he be “CEO for life”.</p> <p>Grab has denied the reports, but Tan's grab for majority voting control does make you wonder.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Ian Hart</strong>,<strong> UBS</strong> co-chair of UK investment banking, has been appointed director-general of the UK<strong> Takeover Panel</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Jake Siewert</strong>, global head of corporate communications at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, is leaving the bank to join private equity firm <strong>Warburg Pincus</strong> where he will reunite with <strong>Timothy Geithner</strong>, his former boss from the US Treasury department, who is a partner there.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>The two heads of <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>'s prime brokerage business, <strong>John Dabbs</strong> and<strong> Ryan Nelson</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4668678b-37a9-4e82-9a0d-7246955ddca9\">are to leave</a> just weeks after the bank reported at least $4.7bn of losses related to the family office <strong>Archegos Capital</strong>.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>GameStop</strong> chief executive <strong>George Sherman</strong>, who has led the group for two years, will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c7de95e-65f0-4698-b55a-ebfb4d8e515d\">step down</a> on July 31, or earlier depending on when a successor is appointed.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Citigroup</strong> has appointed <strong>Philip Drury</strong> to global head of technology and communications.
