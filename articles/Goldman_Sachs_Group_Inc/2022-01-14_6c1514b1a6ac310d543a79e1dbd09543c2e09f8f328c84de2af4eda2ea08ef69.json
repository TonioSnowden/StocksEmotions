These fees are a smaller portion of industry profits, but are valued at far higher multiples on stock markets than the episodic (but potentially massive) windfalls that can come from deals such as Hilton. </p> <p>“It is the new standard,” <strong>Saul Goodman</strong>, head of alternative asset management banking at <strong>Evercore</strong>, told the FT. “Almost every banker in the space that's advising private equity firms on IPOs currently is advising to not contribute a large percentage of performance fees into the public company.”</p> <p>Just as Blackstone's 2007 IPO helped it capitalise on the following financial crisis, TPG believes its new stock currency will be useful if markets turn. “We sleep with one eye open,” TPG chief executive <strong>Jon Winkelried </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/135f73dd-942d-4380-8332-844ca9a82e50\">told the FT</a>. “You've got to set yourself up in a way where you can take advantage of opportunities when they come along and markets turn.”&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The first wave of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25649306-ac8a-4183-894a-7df1eb798acf\">private equity IPOs</a> such as Blackstone, <strong>KKR</strong>, <strong>Carlyle </strong>and <strong>Apollo Global</strong> sold a claim on about half of their performance fees when going public in the years around the financial crisis. </p> <p>However, they're also making changes to match the market's appetite for the “2” part of private equity's “2 and 20” fees.</p> <p>In the past, KKR paid about 40 per cent of overall management and performance-based fee earnings to employees, but in February 2021 it began to weight the pay towards performance fees.</p> <p>Now, just 25 per cent of its management fee-based earnings go to employees, but they get up to 70 per cent of performance-fee-based earnings. Blackstone and Apollo followed suit with similar moves last year.</p> <p>Still, it's TPG that may come out as the biggest winner. The buyout group closed at $34 a share on Thursday, up more than 15 per cent, and lifting its market capitalisation above $10bn. Its dealmakers will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7580d244-cfbd-4728-99a9-49985eb1fdcd\">keep the vast majority of profits</a> the group has earned in a roaring bull market. </p> <p>On a pro forma basis, it would have delivered $505m in distributable earnings to shareholders. However, as of the third quarter, insiders sat on nearly $3.5bn in potential performance-based pay.</p> <p>“TPG should have gone public a decade ago,” one industry insider tells DD. “Clearly, they did well by waiting and getting a much better valuation.”</p> <h2>Mishcon de Reya makes its case to go public</h2> <p>In the list of things a company doesn't need in the run-up to an IPO roadshow, one has to be a sizeable penalty for money-laundering failures. </p> <p>City law firm <strong>Mishcon de Reya</strong> found itself contending with exactly that last week, just as it was gearing up for a charm offensive to tout its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89458568-afca-49b6-b27e-e9bab222bd78\">much-heralded public listing</a>, the FT's Kate Beioley reports. </p> <p>The elite London law firm agreed to a record <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/842799c6-6c7a-40e4-a9b0-951a181c58ea\">£232,500 sanction</a> last week covering historic money-laundering breaches, which the firm reported to the legal regulator for England and Wales. </p> <p>It's not the first time Mishcon has been accused of mishandling funds. In October, the firm was fined £25,000 for letting football agent clients channel commission payments through its client bank account. It's also caught up in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec1f107c-76ff-4b54-ac4e-b245632429b9\">£2.9m lawsuit</a> from a property investment company claiming it accepted “tainted” money for legal fees.</p> <p>Mishcon is hoping investors can look past such details when it heads out on the road in the coming weeks. </p> <p>The firm is finally preparing for a flotation that would make it by far the largest legal business on the UK market. Insiders say it's aiming for a market value of £750m, putting it at almost double the size of its closest rival — a target one broker described as “really ambitious”.</p> <p>The firm must sell investors on its profitability not only as a traditional law firm, but as a broader professional services group. Mishcon's executive chair <strong>Kevin Gold </strong>wants to turbocharge the firm's growth using outside capital, enabling it to invest more heavily in technology — both for the firm and in early-stage ventures it funds — and build its growing consultancy businesses. </p> <p>Making the structural shift won't be easy. “When you're a [private law firm] it's all very simple . . . But when you become a listed company you have to produce profits not just for partners but outside investors . . . It's a more complex model,” said <strong>Tony Williams</strong>, founder of consultancy<strong> Jomati</strong>.</p> <p>Mishcon shelved its initial IPO plans last year after partners revolted, and more than a dozen have walked. While the listing may be lucrative for senior executives such as Gold and managing partner <strong>James Libson</strong>, who will own potentially valuable equity stakes, the firm's lower ranks could be disadvantaged by having to compete for profits with outside shareholders.</p> <p>Investors are not yet fully sold on the idea, either. “The issue for law firms is they're still somewhat untested on the stock market,” said <strong>Anthony Cross</strong>, a manager at<strong> Liontrust Asset Management</strong>. </p> <p>Mishcon is not like other law firms, though. Founded in a one-room office in Brixton in 1937, it has a pugnacious reputation for taking on legal challenges such as <strong>Gina Miller</strong>'s Brexit fight and acting for <strong>Diana, Princess of Wales</strong> during her 1996 divorce.</p> <p>But this time it will be Mishcon, not its clients, standing before the court of public opinion.</p> <h2>The football billionaire playing a losing game</h2> <p>When Italian-American cable billionaire <strong>Rocco Commisso</strong> bought <strong>ACF Fiorentina</strong> from Italy's <strong>Della Valle</strong> retail dynasty, he called it the “quickest closing in soccer history”.</p> <p>But a fellow Serie A club owner likened it more to “running into a fire . . . [He] did not do the diligence.”</p> <p>Over plates of spaghetti with the FT's Murad Ahmed, the hot-tempered New Yorker made clear he has money to burn.</p> <p>Commisso says he's not a “stupid American” that will endlessly sink his fortune into the pandemic-ravaged club. By his own calculations, however, costs are rising fast — “Now we're at €340m, capiche?”</p> <p>As much as the numbers fail to add up, it makes perfect sense in Commisso's world.
