  "text": "<p><em>The author is founder of </em><a href=\"https://www.roomtoread.org/about-us/\"><em>Room to Read</em></a><em>, a US-based non-profit focused on literacy and gender equality in education</em> </p> <p>It's been 21 years since I quit my senior position at Microsoft to found Room to Read. I thought I would be with the organisation forever and never anticipated there would be a time when I would want to relinquish my formal role. </p> <p>That time, it turns out, is now. </p> <p>Since the earliest days of Room to Read, my mantra has been “recruit, delegate, repeat”. I've now reached every founder's dream state: I look across the organisation and know that it will thrive after I depart. <br><br>This is not an abrupt decision. I've thought and talked about it for years. I believe every founder has a duty, eventually, to get out of the way and allow others to take charge without the “founding shadow” forever lurking.</p> <p>For years we've witnessed founders who stick around too long and refuse to empower others. I vowed to do it differently. I've learnt a lot of lessons while making these plans, and hope they can help fellow founders and their boards with succession planning. </p> <p><em><strong>It will be difficult. But start talking about it anyway</strong></em></p> <p>Few enterprises succeed without the passion and long hours that the founders put in. But that commitment makes it difficult for many to contemplate any career other than the one they have. They often resist bringing up the issue of succession planning. </p> <p>Even though the subject can be awkward, founders and boards need to make it a regular agenda item, because nobody should last for ever.</p> <p><em><strong>Transitions should be part of a long-term plan<br><br></strong></em>With the help of our board and my co-founders, I began transition planning more than a decade ago. In 2008 I was in the third year of a global book tour for my memoir, <em>Leaving Microsoft to Change the World</em>. Our little NGO was suddenly bringing in millions of dollars of additional donations. But the constant travel meant that I was rarely in our San Francisco headquarters, and was trying to lead the team from London, Dubai or Tokyo. </p> <p>One of our board members, a partner at Goldman Sachs, told me: “You can be the CEO. Or you can be a globe-trotting rainmaker. But you can't be both, so pick one.” </p> <p>Within a month, my co-founder Erin Ganju took over from me as CEO. It was the first stage in a 13-year process.</p> <p><em><strong>There are roles besides CEO in which a founder can make things happen</strong></em></p> <p>Why did I stick around after giving up the CEO role?&#xa0; Because there were still many hats I could wear. I served in formal roles, including board chair, and head of the nominating and governance committee. I also remained an ambassador and rainmaker, flying more miles and raising more money than ever before. </p> <p><em><strong>Being untethered can pay dividends</strong></em></p> <p>After this transition, I had only one direct report — my executive assistant. Staring at a near-blank calendar, I got on a plane. Month-long fundraising road trips to four continents are not for everyone, but I thrived, meeting 10-50 people per day at meals, coffees and events. The result? We raised an average of $1m a week. </p> <p><em><strong>It helps if there's a shared mission</strong></em></p> <p>When we did our second CEO transition, I found myself reporting into someone who had once been four levels below me in the org chart. Whenever I needed to “check my ego”, I reminded myself that we did not start Room to Read because we wanted fancy titles or status. We did it to help children to gain an education, and as long as my role aligned with that purpose, I went into every day with gusto. And it turns out that Geetha Murali is even better in the CEO role than I was.</p> <p><em><strong>Founders must know that the board has their back<br></strong></em><br>I was blessed with many board members who recognised that founder transitions are not easy, and who offered advice and hand-holding. That deep level of trust was the oil the transition engine needed to run smoothly.<br><br></p> <p>Unfortunately, I have also dealt with board members who played politics and who viewed my eventual departure as an opportunity for themselves to gain in stature. That slowed my transition, because lack of trust and palace intrigue will always throw sand in the gears.<br><br>My advice to every board member is that in order to encourage the founding team to plan a thoughtful transition, you should make it clear in every interaction that the board has their back. </p> <p><em><strong>Success makes transitions harder</strong></em></p> <p>One of the toughest parts of a transition for an entrepreneur is that the bigger their organisation has become, the more likely it is that their self-worth comes from the success of that entity. There's a buzz when you're both founder and CEO, when everyone is singing your praises, and when you have more speaking invitations than you can possibly manage. </p> <p>It can be as addictive as nicotine. But the bigger an organisation gets, the more likely it is that they will need to bring in outsiders and delegate. What <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60a08aa2-4006-11e9-b896-fe36ec32aece\">Jim Collins</a>, the management writer and consultant, described in his book <em>Good to Great</em> as “the genius with a thousand helpers” model won't work once the company gets to a certain size.</p> <p><em><strong>Opportunities abound</strong></em></p> <p>As the Room to Read leadership team grew, and I delegated to them, the need for me to work long hours diminished. I used my free time to co-author a book on purpose, to coach social entrepreneurs and to join the board of a technology-focused private equity group. </p> <p>Room to Read always had the first call on my time. &#xa0;But when it didn't need me, I had a blast helping friends to build their shiny new things. I've not been bored for a second.</p> <p>I hope every founder can one day enjoy what I have today — immense pride in what's been built, faith in the team that will run things in future, and the opportunity to exit on a high note. </p> <p>I will launch a new social venture in early 2022, and am recruiting people to whom I will, once again, delegate!<em><br><br></em></p><p>Source: John Wood 2021 'How to quit: an outgoing founder's advice on succession planning' FT.com 22 December.
