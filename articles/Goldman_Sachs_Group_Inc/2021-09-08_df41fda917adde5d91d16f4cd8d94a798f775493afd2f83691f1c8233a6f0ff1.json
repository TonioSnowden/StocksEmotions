Doubts also have emerged about the persistence of supportive monetary policies, credited with fueling record gains for stocks, now considered richly valued.</p><p>“I think markets are becoming a bit more defensive over the past couple of days,” said James Ragan, D.A. Davidson's director or wealth management research, in a phone interview.</p><p>“We're seeing some outperformance in traditionally defensive sectors, including utilities and consumer staples, and less participation from the tech sector, even though that's holding up relatively well.”</p><p>Ragan attributed the “mild pullback” and “mild rotation” to some fears about economic growth in light of the delta variant of the coronavirus, but also to concerns about inflation, tapering and rancor in Washington over spending, taxes and the budget.</p><p>A clutch of Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs, have cut U.S. growth targets in the wake of weaker-than-expected jobs figures.</p><p>The Federal Reserve's Beige Book on Wednesday showed that economic growth slowed to a moderate pace in early July through August, while noting that safety concerns tied to the delta variant of COVID-19 prompted a pullback in dining out and travel, which weigh on the greater economy.</p><p>On top of that, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a letter to congressional leaders Wednesday that the department could run out of room next month to keep paying the government's bills unless Congress steps in&#xa0;to suspend or raise the federal borrowing limit.</p><p>“A delay that calls into question the federal government's ability to meet all its obligations would likely cause irreparable damage to the U.S. economy and global financial markets,” Yellen wrote.</p><p>Read:Debt limit, social spending, infrastructure battles loom in ‘uniquely frenetic period' for Congress</p><p>New York Fed President John Williams said Wednesday that the U.S. labor market hasn't seen the “substantial” progress necessary for the central bank to slow down its massive $120 billion in monthly bond purchases, but he expects reduced monthly purchases to start later this year.</p><p>St. Louis Fed President Bullard also reiterated in a Wednesday interview with the Financial Times that he expects tapering to start later this year and to end sometime by the first half of next year.</p><p>In other economic data, job openings rose to a record 10.9 million in July,&#xa0;the Labor Department said Wednesday, marking the fifth straight all-time monthly high and exceeding forecasts for a rise of 10 million. Job hires, however, slipped by 160,000 to 6.7 million in July. Separations rose 174,000 to 5.8 million.</p><p>While some strategists remain optimistic about the outlook for markets, investors also have been advised to be more discerning.</p><p>“The best days of cyclical value may be behind us, but it's too early to turn fully to defensive themes. We are sticking with the reflation trade, but with a focus on identifying companies likely to experience upward earnings revisions,” wrote Lauren Goodwin, economist and portfolio strategist at New York Life Investments in a note published Wednesday. &#xa0;</p><p>“We favor a global allocation, with an overweight to international developed equity. Value and small cap equities, with a focus on quality companies, should continue to thrive,” the strategist wrote.</p><p>Read: Stocks may fall 15% by year-end, warns Morgan Stanley.
