  "text": "<p>The divide between Wall Street and Main Street banks has never been starker.</p> <p>The surge in dealmaking this year has unleashed a windfall for investment bankers. This fee bonanza helped Goldman Sachs deliver a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/692b5b3e-af2c-44d6-8dc3-2985bd781647\">60 per cent rise in profits</a> for the third quarter and produce a 22.5 per cent return on equity on an annualised basis. A day earlier, rival Morgan Stanley reported its own gangbuster results. </p> <p>Record merger and initial public offering activity have allowed Wall Street's two standalone investment banks to pull ahead of Main Street rivals. While the likes of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America have also benefited from strong investment banking revenue, their consumer lending businesses weigh down earnings because of sluggish loan growth.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley and Goldman offer very different investment propositions. The latter remains more geared towards cyclical market activity. Trading and investment banking made up more than two-thirds of Goldman's revenue during the third quarter, compared with under half at Morgan Stanley.</p> <p>Goldman's valuation reflects a riskier earnings profile. Though its share price has climbed almost 50 per cent this year, touching record highs, Goldman trades at just 10 times forward earnings. Compare that with the 14 to 15 times multiple that Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and BofA receive. </p> <p>Too harsh? Goldman has in recent years moved to diversify away from its Wall Street roots, namely with its push into consumer banking and wealth management. Revenue from this unit, which includes its online bank Marcus and its Apple credit card, grew more than a third — albeit from a low base — to more than $2bn. The acquisition of European asset manager NN Investment Partners and buy-now-pay-later fintech GreenSky this year underscores David Solomon's efforts to build more sustainable revenue flows.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley, with its robust wealth management and investment management businesses, has progressed further in its transformation. But Goldman shares still can catch up if — a big “if” — it can grow its consumer and asset management businesses as fast as its investment bank. </p><p>Source:  2021 'Goldman Sachs: market still fails to give bank credit for its strategy' FT.com 15 October.
