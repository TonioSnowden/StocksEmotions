  "title": "Technology:  Nine Point's Bankruptcy Sale Can Proceed  ----  By Andrew Scurria",
  "text": "<p>   A federal judge said Friday that Nine Point Energy Holdings Inc.'s planned bankruptcy sale can proceed without honoring a pipeline company's claim. </p><p>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and other Nine Point lenders can buy the company out of bankruptcy free of a $150 million claim asserted by pipeline operator Caliber Midstream Partners LP, according to the ruling by Judge Richard Andrews of the U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del. </p><p>   Caliber argued its claim was secured and had to be paid or protected as part of any sale of Nine Point, which operates 198 wells in North Dakota and Montana and filed for bankruptcy in March. </p><p>   Judge Andrews refused to grant Caliber any assurance of payment from the lenders, saying that its claim was unsecured and therefore not entitled to protection in a sale transaction. </p><p>   The judge also cleared Nine Point to walk away from its exclusive commitment to use Caliber's pipeline system to ship and transport energy. </p><p>   After filing for bankruptcy, companies have wide latitude to reject contractual arrangements they consider burdensome. </p><p>   Caliber had argued that its exclusivity rights were still binding even after Nine Point rejected their deal. </p><p>   Nine Point declined to comment Friday. Caliber didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Becky Yerak and Alexander Gladstone contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
