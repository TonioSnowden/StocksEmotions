  "title": "Banking & Finance: Lime Rock's New Fund Buys Time",
  "text": "<p>The fund has exited most of its other investments, according to the Westport, Conn.-based firm.</p><p>Two entities owned by CrownRock Minerals LP -- a Midland, Texas, business that invests in mineral and royalty interests across the surrounding Permian Basin -- represent the majority of the assets transferred to the new fund, according to Lime Rock. CrownRock Minerals was formed in 2016 as a joint venture between Lime Rock and energy company CrownQuest Operating LLC.</p><p>Goldman Sachs provided most of the $134 million in new commitments to the continuation fund, including co-investment capital, Lime Rock said. The investment manager backed the new fund with capital from its Vintage Funds strategy, which focuses on private-equity secondary deals, according to Lime Rock.</p><p>Stakes rolled over from limited partners in the old fund accounted for roughly $69 million of the new vehicle's capital, said Jonathan Farber, a Lime Rock co-founder and managing director.</p><p>Even as Lime Rock's Fund VI approached the end of its 10-year life, the firm believed it was too early to liquidate its CrownRock investment, as oil-and-gas companies are still developing the fields that underlie the holdings, Mr. Farber said. \"The mineral vehicles have a lot of growth and a lot of remaining value to add over time,\" he said. \"We wanted to offer investors the option of continuing to hold those vehicles,\" while also providing an exit alternative.</p><p>Mineral and royalty rights are considered safer than direct energy investments because their owners get a portion of the revenue generated by underlying wells without having to help cover operating costs, industry consultants say.</p><p>Those rights can also appeal to environmentally conscious investors looking for an indirect way to invest in oil and gas, said Rodney Reid, a managing director at investment bank Moelis &amp; Co. who leads its private-fund advisory practice. Mr. Reid helped Lime Rock raise the continuation fund. \"The mineral space is a step removed for some investors that have more sensitivities to being more directly invested in oil and gas businesses,\" he said.</p><p>The new fund also reflects the exceptional growth of general partner-led secondary deals that enable private-equity firms to hold on to portfolio companies when a sale is deemed premature, Mr. Reid said.</p>",
