  "text": "<p>These investors, which include major firms such as Pimco and Fidelity International , commit to transition their investments to achieve net zero portfolio greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner. They'll meanwhile try to achieve interim portfolio emissions reduction targets by 2030 or earlier.&#xa0;</p><p>The effort announced this week was created by sustainable-investing advocacy Ceres, the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change&#xa0;and investor networks from Asia, Australia and Europe and pairs with a similar pledge a few months ago issued by an international collaboration of asset managers.</p><p>“A broad group of investors understands that climate change is the biggest risk and the reality of risk cuts across every sector,” Kirsten Spalding, senior program director of the Ceres Investor Network, told MarketWatch . “We're not going to see investors just getting out of energy but are going to see them aggressively reinvent low-carbon future. And there are opportunities to make money there.”</p><p>Read:  Ignore climate change at your own risk, says BlackRock — green-energy transition will drive 25% output growth by 2040 </p><p>&#xa0;Through the&#xa0; Paris Aligned Investment Initiative , the networks are releasing a&#xa0; Net Zero Asset Owners Commitment &#xa0;for asset owners to commit to 10 specific actions. The groups are also publishing a&#xa0; Net Zero Investment Framework &#xa0;to assist both asset owners and managers in using rigorous methodology to align their investments with a net zero future. The voluntary Paris pact urges its nation members to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and more ambitiously below 1.5 degrees, largely by cutting emissions.</p><p>The $226.4 billion New York State Common Retirement Fund , the third-largest U.S. public pension fund, is on board. &#xa0;In December, the pension fund committed to a net-zero carbon emissions target  by 2040.</p><p>“Climate change poses significant risks and opportunities for the New York State Common Retirement Fund , the markets and the economy as a whole,” said Thomas DiNapoli, sole fiduciary of the New York State Common Retirement Fund . “At the same time, it is becoming clear that efforts to comply with the Paris Agreement are on the rise by countries and companies alike. The actions listed in the Net Zero Asset Owners Commitment provide examples of the sort of forward-thinking ideas investors can use to protect the long-term value of their investments.”</p><p>So far, the Paris Aligned Investment Initiative involves&#xa0;110 investors worldwide representing $33 trillion in assets in management; 22 of these investors representing $1.2 trillion in assets are signatories to the&#xa0;Net Zero Asset Owners Commitment, while the&#xa0;Net Zero Investment Framework&#xa0;is being put to practical use by 33 major investors managing a combined $8.5 trillion in assets.</p><p>Net-zero pledges are popular among technology giants  and most recently have included Wells FargoWFC, Goldman Sachs GroupGS and CitigroupC, who've joined other banking interests.</p><p>Read: Goldman Sachs pushed to disclose if its oil-patch financing works against net-zero emissions goal </p><p>But individual pledges also highlight the wide gap in how firms will change policies, report those changes and measure progress, thus boosting interest in collective frameworks.</p><p>The IIGCC said 35 investors managing $8.5 trillion are already using the framework, including Pacific Investment Management Co , or PIMCO, as well as Fidelity International and DWS Group.</p>",
