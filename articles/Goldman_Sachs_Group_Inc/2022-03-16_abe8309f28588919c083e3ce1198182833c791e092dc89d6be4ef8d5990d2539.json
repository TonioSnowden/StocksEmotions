  "title": "World News: Pandemic and War Threaten China's Economic Targets",
  "text": "<p>Retail sales, a gauge of household consumption, were up 6.7%, beating the 4.3% expected by the surveyed economists. Catering sales, including restaurants, grew at a faster pace than goods sales for the first time since July.</p><p>Fixed-asset investment recovered strongly, up 12.2% in the first two months from a year earlier, beating the economists 5% prediction and the 4.9% pace a year earlier.</p><p>Investment in infrastructure projects was up 8.1% from a year earlier, an indicator that authorities plan to rely on more publicly funded projects to drive growth as the contribution from exports wanes and the real-estate sector's woes drag on.</p><p>Defying market expectations, the central bank on Tuesday kept a key interest rate unchanged. Still, Goldman Sachs economists expect there will be more easing measures in coming months, such as cuts in the policy interest rate and banks' reserve-requirement ratio.</p><p>Despite the forecast-beating official data, China's overall growth remains unbalanced, with signs of weak demand and pressure building up in the jobs market.</p><p>Broad credit expansion pulled back to 10.2% in February from 10.5% in January, slowing for the first time since September. In February, new medium-to-long term household loans, primarily mortgages, contracted for the first time since 2008, signaling that confidence remains weak even after banks in some cities cut mortgage lending rates to spur demand.</p><p>Home sales by value in the first two months were down 22.1% from a year earlier, the biggest decline since March 2020, when the erupting Covid-19 pandemic dealt a hammer blow to China's economy. Real-estate investment was up 3.7% from a year earlier, compared with a 4.4% pace for 2021 as a whole.</p><p>China's official unemployment rate in February was 5.5%, up 0.4 percentage point from the end of 2021, while the youth jobless rate climbed to 15.3% from 14.3%.</p><p>\"Given the downward pressure on organic growth, I think achieving a 5.5% target is really, really challenging,\" said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia economist at S&amp;P Global Ratings. Beijing in early March set a growth target for 2022 of around 5.5%, a goal deemed ambitious by many economists considering the multiple headwinds.</p><p>Chinese manufacturers must contend with profit-squeezing surges in commodity and raw-materials costs. Prices of some commodities including nickel and wheat have hit decade highs, fueled by the war in Ukraine. Slower global growth could weaken demand for Chinese exports.</p><p>\"Changes in geopolitics have led to a relatively obvious impact on global commodity prices, and China may face rising pressure from imported inflation,\" Fu Linghui, spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, said Tuesday, adding that the direct impact from the Russia-Ukraine conflict on China's economy would be limited, as the two countries are minor trading partners with China.</p><p>A new wave of Covid-19 outbreaks, with the number of reported daily cases the highest since early 2020, has set off lockdowns and factory closures that threaten exports and domestic demand for services.</p><p>Covid outbreaks pose the biggest downside risk to China's economy and make the government's 5.5% growth target more challenging, said Yi Xiong, chief China economist at Deutsche Bank. The bank predicts first-quarter growth from a year earlier of 4.5%, and a full-year pace of 5.1%.</p><p>Economists from ANZ, a bank, predict that a one-week lockdown of the affected regions could knock as much as 0.8 percentage point off GDP growth.</p><p>---</p><p>Bingyan Wang contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
