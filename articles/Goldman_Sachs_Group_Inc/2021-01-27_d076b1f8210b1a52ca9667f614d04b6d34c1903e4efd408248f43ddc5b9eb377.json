  "title": "Goldman Sachs Cuts Pay Of CEO Solomon by 36%",
  "text": "<p>In October, Goldman agreed to pay nearly $3 billion to government officials in four countries to end an investigation into work it performed for 1MDB, a Malaysian fund that prosecutors had alleged was used to pay bribes to politicians in Malaysia and the Middle East. The bank said at the time that it would take a total of $174 million in compensation from current and former executives. Mr. Solomon's 2020 pay would have been $10 million higher but for the actions its board took in response to the 1MDB saga, Goldman said in the filing.</p><p>His compensation package consisted of a $2 million base salary, a $4.65 million cash bonus and a $10.85 million stock award that is tied to how well the bank performs over the next few years.</p>",
