  "title": "Dealmakers' worst nightmare: antitrust agencies form their own monopoly",
  "text": "<h2>Regulators of the world, unite!</h2> <p>Here's a combination most corporate chieftains didn't see coming: America's top antitrust regulators and the EU's competition watchdog have put aside their differences in the battle to end anti-competitive behaviours by the world's largest companies. </p> <p><strong>Margrethe Vestager</strong>, the EU's competition chief, can barely contain her excitement as she admits that the appointment of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eba8d3d7-dba7-4389-858c-5406c31b413d\"><strong>Lina Khan</strong></a> to head of the <strong>US Federal Trade Commission</strong> has ushered in a new era of transatlantic co-operation between antitrust regulators. </p> <p>The combination is so powerful that <strong>Sean Heather</strong>, senior vice-president of international regulatory affairs and antitrust at the <strong>US Chamber of Commerce</strong>, said that the regulators' co-operation constitutes “itself cartel behaviour”.</p> <p>For once, regulators are learning from the guys they're trying to bring down as they accept the power of scale and synergies in winning cases.</p> <p>“I think it was really interesting that both <strong>Jonathan Kanter </strong>[the newly appointed chief of the US<strong> Department of Justice</strong>'s antitrust division], Lina Khan and I, we are different generations,” Vestager <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03a2df73-da6a-4bc5-b242-dd3ea71bcd6a\">told the FT</a>. “We have different years of experience . . . we have different educational backgrounds, but there's a lot of alignment in the way that we think.”</p> <p>In the past, if one of the agencies took a lead on a case, the others would lose interest in the matter as they didn't want to be the follower and preferred to win on their own. </p> <p>In this new era, the opposite is true. The agencies recognise that they're understaffed, and that it's basically impossible to scrutinise every deal on their own given the boom in dealmaking over the past decade.</p> <p>This new approach also means recognising one's own limitations. Often when a regulator doesn't have a case strong enough in their jurisdiction to block a deal, another agency holds more power elsewhere. If the agencies collaborate in the friendlier jurisdiction, they'll have a better chance of winning a case. </p> <p>Some examples? </p> <p>Last week,<strong> Illumina</strong> <a href=\"https://timesofsandiego.com/business/2021/12/17/illumina-challenges-eu-in-court-accuses-regulators-of-radical-change-in-policy-on-8b-grail-deal/\">took aim</a> at the <strong>European Commission </strong>over its investigation into the biotech company's $8bn takeover of<strong> Grail</strong>, even though Grail has no activities in Europe.</p> <p>And earlier this month regulators <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba37d061-cd26-47c0-9ff9-1fe8257ee8e2\">sued to block</a> <strong>Nvidia</strong>'s acquisition of UK chip design company <strong>Arm </strong>from <strong>SoftBank</strong>, a deal valued at $82bn, following similar probes launched by the EU and UK. &#xa0;</p> <p>And last month, the UK's <strong>Competition and Markets Authority </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b042f34-9f29-4b15-9316-01c555bdee2f#post-7fedb644-0354-4115-ac9e-ceba4a5805f1\">ordered</a> <strong>Facebook</strong>'s parent company <strong>Meta </strong>to unwind its $315m acquisition of <strong>Giphy</strong>. Meta complained about the judgment, not least because it said Giphy had no concrete plans to enter the UK market. &#xa0;</p> <p>What do these three deals have in common? People with knowledge of the probes into Nvidia and Illumina told the FT that regulators in the US and Europe are in regular contact and have been sharing information about their cases. &#xa0;</p> <p>Whether this new phase of co-operation will actually halt the wave of dealmaking is unclear. </p> <p>A top banker told DD that it won't do much to stop the avalanche of private equity transactions or Spac mergers (although the SEC might have different plans).&#xa0;</p> <p>A corporate lawyer was a little more concerned “[They] are complementing each other. Will this led to more deals getting blocked? Absolutely. What can't get blocked here might be blocked in the European Union, and the guys in DC will be assisting them.”&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h2>Nikola: the face of the blank-cheque bust, or Spacs' comeback kid?</h2> <p>How much hype is too much hype?</p> <p>It's the question facing both a group of jurors deliberating the fate of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a5035c3-ff65-4721-9714-4dcfb3175006\"><strong>Theranos</strong></a> founder <strong>Elizabeth Holmes </strong>in a San Diego courtroom, and the Spac-spun electric truckmaker <strong>Nikola</strong>.</p> <p>The US <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission </strong>has made its view clear on the latter. </p> <p>Nikola has agreed to pay $125m to settle charges that it defrauded investors by misleading them on the capabilities of its vehicles, the regulator <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec4cbb58-d41c-4487-a24a-8ac8ce088375\">announced on Tuesday</a>. It said Nikola's founder and former chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/168be1c5-5f54-473f-b373-096b8a511ba9\"><strong>Trevor Milton</strong></a> had given a false impression of the company's technological prowess, production capabilities and financial outlook.</p> <p>The truckmaker, which went public via a Spac in June 2020 and was briefly valued higher than <strong>Ford</strong> despite not having sold a single vehicle, “neither admits nor denies the SEC's findings”, it stipulated in accepting the fine.</p> <p>Milton, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4fc81eb-ae24-4039-b535-0eb5d119dc84\">resigned last year</a> after a report by short seller <strong>Hindenburg Research</strong> first surfaced accusing the company of an <a href=\"https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/\">“intricate fraud”</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7469bb92-10c7-49a5-8646-193fb3777d2f\">now faces charges</a> from US federal prosecutors for his alleged misrepresentations. </p> <p>He isn't accepting a smooth fall from grace. Milton asked a federal judge to throw out the <a href=\"https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rBbBMaRJkZNs/v0\">indictment</a>, arguing that the government unfairly relied on statements made before Nikola was a public company “in an attempt to criminalise promotional speech about Nikola's products”, according to court filings <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/nikola-s-milton-seeks-to-dismiss-two-counts-of-indictment?sref=OziMsGoK\">cited by Bloomberg</a>.</p> <p>DD readers may recall the company's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLidTCqAAtY&amp;t=1049s\">claims</a> during the unveiling of its Nikola One prototype that it was fully functional, which prosecutors allege to be a lie, and the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a875fe3f-f59e-4dcb-aebc-ee54280122be\">infamous video </a>of a Nikola truck rolling downhill. </p> <p>Milton's sweeping statements, driven by the same culture of hype and hubris that fuels plenty of Spacs and Silicon Valley start-ups, will be on full display as SEC chair <strong>Gary Gensler </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22dcc2fe-f902-40cb-88cb-bcd1cb5ebfa0\">turns up the heat</a> on the polarising investment vehicles.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a981aec7-852f-42f0-a33c-076b15bfca4c\"><strong>Lucid Motors</strong></a>, an electric car group under investigation by the SEC over disclosures and forecasts it made when it merged with a Spac run by former <strong>Citigroup</strong> investment banker <strong>Michael Klein</strong>, could be next.</p> <p>Despite Milton's legal travails, Nikola is slowly attempting to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/621cb553-d7f2-4cf6-a86b-f8cf9bd073c7\">recharge its reputation</a> without him. “It's real, I promise!” Nikola's new chief executive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/032a6273-7443-4a59-b207-9004b42cbb3a\">joked to the FT</a> a few months back while unveiling its first functioning vehicle set to hit production in 2023.</p> <p>If the truckmaker can chart a successful comeback story, Spac investors could be inspired to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d1723a8e-c146-4d48-8475-01cc9947a5d6\">buy into the hype once more</a>.</p> <h2>GSK jabs back at activist investors</h2> <p>Corporate heavyweight <strong>Sir Dave “Drastic” Lewis</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f168590-e528-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59\">once described</a> to the FT as “quite simply the bloke who saved <strong>Tesco</strong>”, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b86c4b0a-3e05-4303-80ff-880778ceb15d\">set to become chair</a> of <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong>'s consumer health division as it prepares to be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/887a20d2-4d72-4ce0-8722-4883a6420233\">spun off</a> next year.</p> <p>Executives at the GSK unit are hoping such glowing reviews continue to ring true. The UK pharma giant is under siege by activists <strong>Elliott</strong> and <strong>Bluebell</strong>, which has cast doubt over whether chief executive <strong>Emma Walmsley </strong>is the right leader for a slimmed-down GSK.</p> <p>Elliott has also urged GSK to consider selling its consumer unit, rather than Walmsley's plan to demerge. In hiring Lewis to lead the charge, the CEO has planted a firm foot down against her adversaries.</p> <p>While many shareholders would rather execute a spin-off rather than take the private equity money and run, that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/95ba1ca6-935f-4a15-80a6-fe2542744535\">doesn't necessarily mean</a> they're on her side. Some could be eager to avoid giving management a heap of cash to play with when they're not sold on the top brass. </p> <p>If done properly, the split will be a win for Walmsley in defending her spot and also for executives at the consumer health division, who hope to gain a higher valuation on the business than pharma experts currently prescribe, as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8dd2563-eeb6-4e82-aa51-4a540a6a0f70\">Lex writes</a>.</p> <p>After lagging in the race to bring a Covid-19 vaccine to market, both sides of the business are hoping for a fresh start.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b8ce71c-a87a-440e-9f3d-58069ca0480b\"><strong>Tim Stokely</strong></a> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63fef0ef-e883-4772-9637-5a24fbbf706d\">unexpectedly stepping down</a> as chief executive of <strong>OnlyFans</strong>, the British subscription platform that he founded five years ago and which has become best known for pornography. </p></li>  <li><p>City veteran <strong>Jan du Plessis</strong>, the former chair of <strong>BT</strong> and miner<strong> Rio Tinto</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c595a9a-fd63-4c0d-9a48-af5e0eaddc4d\">has been nominated</a> by the government as the new chair of the UK accounting watchdog, whose board has been without a permanent leader for more than 18 months.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice</strong> has appointed<strong> Jon Selib</strong>, former senior vice-president of global policy and public affairs at <strong>Pfizer</strong>, as managing director and global external affairs leader.</p></li>  <li><p>Wall Street veteran <strong>Abby Joseph Cohen</strong>, a senior investment strategist at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> and one of the industry's most prolific market watchers, will retire at the end of the year to become professor of business at the<strong> Columbia University </strong>faculty, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/goldman-sachs-strategist-abby-joseph-cohen-retiring-2021-12-20/?campaign_id=4&amp;emc=edit_dk_20211221&amp;instance_id=48354&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;regi_id=93393619&amp;segment_id=77558&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=23d2a9747dbce6ed82dfb30d37d2c356\">per Reuters</a>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Casino crackdown </strong>For two decades, Macau's reigning casino king Alvin Chau was living a capitalist dream in China.
