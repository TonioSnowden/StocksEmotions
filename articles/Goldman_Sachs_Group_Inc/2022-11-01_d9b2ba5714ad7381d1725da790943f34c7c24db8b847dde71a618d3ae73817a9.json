  "text": "<p>The overall economy, while losing some momentum, is still growing. The Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates againthis week as it attempts to cool the economy and tame inflation running near a four-decade high.</p><p>The Labor Department figures, to be released at 10 a.m. Eastern time Tuesday, include job openings, hiring, layoffs and voluntary quits by workers.</p><p>Job openings declined 10% in August to a seasonally adjusted 10.1 million, the Labor Department said, but are well above the 6 million unemployed people seeking work that month. The imbalance is putting pressure on wages and overall inflation.</p><p>Jobs site Indeed estimated that openings continued to fall and totaled around 10 million in mid-October. Indeed data show that jobs typically common in the technology industry, such as software development and marketing, had declined the most this year through mid-October.</p><p>Companies in technology, real estate and financial services, which are sensitive to higher interest rates, such as Meta Platforms Inc., Goldman Sachs and Redfin Corp., have laid off workers or announced plans to trim staff this year.</p><p>\"What we're seeing right now are signs of a labor market that's normalizing,\" said Nick Bunker, an economist at Indeed. \"Some sectors are going through a period of retrenchment while others are still trying to bounce back from the pandemic.\"</p><p>Employers in industries that typically struggle to hire enough workers, such as healthcare and education, will continue to add jobs but eventually slow the pace of hiring if the economy weakens further, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon.</p><p>\"There's unlikely to be a sector in which employment will continue to grow very strongly. It may still see growth, but at a more subdued pace,\" Mr. Daco said. He added that labor demand already has shown early signs of softening as companies anticipate a recession and try to limit labor costs without laying off workers.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your business doing to attract and retain workers? Join the conversation below.</p><p>\"There is increased caution and discretion among business executives in their talent-management decisions like more hiring freezes or perhaps making less of an effort to keep employees who might want to leave,\" Mr. Daco said.</p><p>Ford Motor Co. asked white-collar employees deemed to be underperforming to choose between taking a severance package or improving performance.</p><p>For some leisure and hospitality businesses, hiring remains difficult. Robert Lindo, vice president and director at Casino M8trix, a gambling and entertainment venue in San Jose, Calif., said his company of about 610 workers has about 80 job openings.</p><p>Mr. Lindo said it has been difficult to hire servers, bartenders, line cooks and security officers, causing the company to reduce the amount of food options it serves and open fewer tables.</p><p>\"There are just no responses to posts for some of the open positions, so wage increases are constantly in consideration,\" Mr. Lindo said. He added that the high cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area and the proximity of tech companies that typically pay their hourly workers more adds to his challenge in competing for workers.</p><p>Write to Bryan Mena at bryan.mena@wsj.com</p><p>Report on Worker Demand to Indicate if Labor Market Cooled Further</p>",
