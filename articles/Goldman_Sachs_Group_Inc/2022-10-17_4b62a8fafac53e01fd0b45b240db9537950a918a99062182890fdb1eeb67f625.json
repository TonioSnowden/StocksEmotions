  "text": "<p>Bankers will begin the search this week for a buyer for Inter Milan, making it the latest top-tier football club to be put up for sale, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>US boutique bank Raine Group, which handled the record-breaking £2.5bn auction of Chelsea this year, and Goldman Sachs are working on the sale process, the people said. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/e617f5c3-8b3e-44f8-b528-54896002132c\">Inter</a> has been owned since 2016 by Nanjing-based electronics retailer Suning, which acquired the club during a wave of investment from China in European football. </p> <p>A number of Chinese owners have since sold out or reduced their exposure, as gathering economic troubles at home and waning political backing for the project prompted a rethink. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/1d284055-1b3d-42e4-987d-7eb5a8be6175\">Suning</a>, one of China's largest bricks-and-mortar retailers, has struggled as consumers made the switch to online shopping. </p> <p>The company's large short-term debt pile also left it exposed to a tightening of credit conditions in the Chinese economy.</p> <p>In February last year, Suning rushed to raise new financing to plug the funding gap at Inter caused by the coronavirus pandemic, resulting in a $275mn loan from distressed debt specialist Oaktree Capital. </p> <p>Then in July, Suning itself was rescued by the local government and shareholder Alibaba in a $1.4bn bailout, adding to speculation about the long-term likelihood of keeping ownership of Inter. In January this year, Inter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21570e8f-6fcd-4101-b1fc-8b951945eb99\">returned</a> to the bond market.</p> <p>Last month, Inter's board signed off on the club's latest set of accounts, which showed revenue increasing to €440mn and a loss of €140mn for the 2021/22 financial year. The club said that the majority shareholder “had formally expressed his commitment to backing the group by ensuring asset support”. </p> <p>Inter is led by president Steven Zhang, the son of Zhang Jindong, Suning's founder who paid €270mn for a majority stake in the “Nerazzurri” in 2016. </p> <p>Suning is ready to inject capital of €100mn this year in tranches, according to a person close to the club. The person pointed to previous guidance that Suning is open to new partners and would consider the sale of a minority stake. </p> <p>The banks and Inter Milan declined to comment.</p> <p>Italian football has become an increasingly popular destination for international investors. Roma, Atalanta, Fiorentina and Genoa are among several clubs now controlled by American owners. </p> <p>This year, US investment group RedBird Capital bought Inter's local rivals AC Milan in a deal worth €1.2bn, a record for a European football club outside the English Premier League. </p> <p>However, Italian football presents a number of challenges for investors compared with other European leagues. </p> <p>Serie A has the second lowest broadcast revenues of the so-called “Big Five” leagues, with Italian football's international rights fetching about €230mn a year, according to Enders Analysis, far below Spain's figure of €900mn. </p> <p>Many Italian clubs are also sorely in need of stadium upgrades or replacements. Inter shares its home with AC Milan — the San Siro. Plans have been drawn up for a new 65,000 stadium, which is expected to cost about €1.3bn and likely to take many years to complete. </p> <p>The shared stadium model has a drawback for potential investors as hosting double the number of games makes it far harder to generate revenue from other events. </p><p>Source: Samuel Agini and Josh Noble in London 2022 'Italian football club Inter Milan kicks off search for buyer' FT.com 17 October.
