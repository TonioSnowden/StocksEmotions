  "text": "<p>   LONDON -- Former U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak took a step toward becoming the country's next prime minister after his main rival for the job, Boris Johnson, pulled out of the race on Sunday evening, averting a head-to-head contest between the two men that had threatened to split the ruling Conservative Party and further roil financial markets. </p><p>   The decision by Mr. Johnson -- who was forced to step down as prime minister and party leader over the summer after a series of scandals -- leaves Mr. Sunak as the heavy favorite to replace Liz Truss in the top job. </p><p>   Ms. Truss, who took office Sept. 6, said last week she was quitting after her economic program imploded, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. The only other remaining candidate for her position is Penny Mordaunt, the leader of the House of Commons. </p><p>   The contest could be over by Monday afternoon, when candidates need to secure at least 100 nominations from fellow Tory lawmakers to stand as leader of the party. On Sunday, Mr. Sunak had at least 128 public backers, while Ms. Mordaunt had around 23 backers out of 357 Conservative lawmakers, according to the British Broadcasting Corp. </p><p>   It was unclear, however, how many of Mr. Johnson's supporters would now throw their support behind Ms. Mordaunt, a former defense minister. If Ms. Mordaunt does clear the nomination threshold by the Monday afternoon deadline, then the Conservative Party's 170,000 members would pick a winner by Friday, and analysts said either candidate could win. </p><p>   Mr. Johnson, who was forced to quit as prime minister this summer following a mutiny in his party, wanted to stage a dramatic comeback once Ms. Truss's premiership collapsed. Ms. Truss resigned while Mr. Johnson was on vacation in the Caribbean, prompting him to race back to the U.K. over the weekend to drum up support. </p><p>   Following two days of frantic horse trading, Mr. Johnson declared Sunday that he had gained enough support from Conservative lawmakers to run in the contest against Mr. Sunak but that continuing in the race \"would simply not be the right thing to do\" given that a large chunk of Conservative lawmakers weren't backing him. </p><p>   Mr. Johnson, a deeply controversial figure in the party, added that \"you can't govern effectively unless you have a united party in Parliament.\" He said 102 Tory lawmakers backed him, a number that couldn't be independently verified. </p><p>   If Mr. Sunak wins, it will cap a meteoric political rise and make him the U.K.'s first prime minister of Indian heritage. The 42-year-old former hedge-fund manager gained a reputation as a steady-handed pragmatist when he served as chancellor of the exchequer, the equivalent of finance minister. </p><p>   This summer he complained that Ms. Truss's economic platform of leading a British economic revival through slashing taxes was \"fairy tale economics,\" and would risk destabilizing public finances and prompting a possible backlash from the markets. His warnings proved true just weeks later as Ms. Truss rolled out her program, which combined tax cuts with a big new energy subsidy program, and was dealt a humiliating setback when market turbulence forced her to retreat, and eventually resign. </p><p>   The possible return of Mr. Johnson caused alarm in some quarters of the Conservative party, coming just months after 50 members of his government quit, questioning his integrity. Still a sizable chunk of the Tory party pined for a return of the 58-year-old on account of his ability to win elections. The Conservative Party is polling at historic lows. </p><p>   On Saturday evening Mr. Johnson held discussions with Mr. Sunak, but failed to strike a deal that would see one of them pull out, James Dudderidge, a Conservative lawmaker who was helping marshal Mr. Johnson's campaign, said. </p><p>   On Sunday Mr. Sunak officially announced his candidacy pledging to \"fix our economy, unite our party and deliver for our country.\" </p><p>   As the day went on, Mr. Sunak appeared to get more traction with several public endorsements from high-ranking Tories. </p><p>   While Mr. Sunak is the favorite, he still has to contend with Ms. Mordaunt, who is popular with Conservative members. The 49-year-old former public-relations professional has campaigned as a neutral figure who can reunite the Tory party's feuding clans. However she has a much lower public profile than Mr. Sunak. </p><p>   Critics have said Mr. Sunak is too rich to appeal to working-class voters. That could prove problematic if the next prime minister has to push through spending cuts to appease investors nervous about the nation's finances. Mr. Sunak is estimated to be the richest member of the House of Commons, and his wife, Akshata Murty, is the daughter of an Indian billionaire. </p><p>   Mr. Sunak previously argued his rise to wealth embodies the meritocratic values of the Conservative Party. His grandparents immigrated in the 1960s and are originally from India. His mother ran a pharmacy in southern England, and his father was a doctor. </p><p>   Mr. Sunak attended an elite British private school and went on to work for Goldman Sachs. After a stint with a hedge fund he got into politics and was identified within the party as a rising star. His early support of Brexit during the 2016 referendum further played in his favor. </p><p>   Now Mr. Sunak will have to win over Mr. Johnson's supporters. </p><p>   Mr. Johnson had appointed Mr. Sunak as his chancellor in 2020. This past July 5, Mr. Sunak resigned from Mr. Johnson's cabinet, saying they had differing views on the economy. The resignation triggered an avalanche of further resignations which eventually forced Mr. Johnson out of office. The former prime minister had been under fire for a series of scandals, including being fined for breaking Covid-19 lockdown rules by attending a party. </p><p></p>",
