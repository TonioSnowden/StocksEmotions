  "title": "Manchin-Schumer Deal Would Have Moderate Inflation-Fighting Effect, Economists Say; Most inflation benefits of bill—which cuts drug costs, subsidizes healthcare premiums and reduces the deficit—would come in future years, according to estimates",
  "text": "<p>The deal announced Wednesday raises some taxes and limits prescription drug price increases, both of which would help slow inflation, economists said. But it also raises government spending on climate and healthcare programs, which could add more upward pressure on prices. Overall, the agreement reduces the federal deficit by about $300 billion over a decade, according to Senate Democrats.</p><p>The net effect, economists said, would likely restrain price increases. But that effect will be relatively small and won't show up for several years.</p><p>\"You add it all up, it will lean against inflation,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"This is by no means a game-changing piece of legislation. It's relatively small in the grand scheme of things.\"</p><p>Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate the proposal's overall spending and revenue effects would represent less than 0.1% of the U.S. economy in the first part of the decade and about 0.2% after 2028.</p><p>An economic model run by the University of Pennsylvania estimated the framework would shave about 0.25 percentage point from inflation annually by the late 2020s, according to Kent Smetters, who directs the model. The model looks at the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, the inflation gauge favored by the Federal Reserve.</p><p>The proposal will likely not offer much short-term help to the Fed in its effort to cool inflation this year. Still, if enacted, it could take some pressure off Fed officials in later years, economists said.</p><p>\"I personally think that we're going to be wrestling with inflation for many years to come,\" said Jason Furman, an economist at Harvard University. \"So help two years from now is welcome.\"</p><p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during a press conference Thursday that she didn't have a specific estimate for the extent to which the bill could reduce inflation. But she said the proposals' measures to reduce the cost of prescription drugs and subsidize healthcare premiums would lower costs.</p><p>\"These are two important contributions that we should see come into play as soon as the legislation is passed and put into effect. Beyond that there is deficit reduction in the bill, and over time I see deficit reduction as an appropriate accompaniment to the policy changes the Fed is putting into effect,\" she said.</p><p>The Fed is raising interest rates aggressively to combat inflation. Officials agreed Wednesday to lift rates by three-quarters of a percentage point, the second straight rate increase of that magnitude. Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters after the meeting that the central bank was committed to bringing inflation down to its 2% target, even if it meant slowing economic growth.</p><p>The Senate proposal \"is not going to have a transformative effect on inflation,\" said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \"What it can do is make it a little easier for the Fed to do its job.\"</p><p>There are several ways elements of the deal could ease pressure on prices, economists said.</p><p>First, the agreement calls for a 15% minimum corporate tax rate and higher taxes on certain forms of income. It also includes money to beef up tax enforcement at the Internal Revenue Service. By reducing the amount of money people and businesses have available, the plan would lower overall demand in the economy, which, in theory, should relieve some price pressure.</p><p>Likewise, the overall reduction in the federal deficit in the proposal would have a similar effect of curbing the country's total demand for goods and services.</p><p>\"It's the flip of stimulus,\" Mr. Zandi said. \"It's fiscal restraint.\"</p><p>Second, the deal contains several provisions to lower the price of prescription drugs. It would allow the government to negotiate with drug companies for lower prices for prescription drugs purchased through the Medicare program. It would also require rebates to prevent drug companies from raising prices faster than overall inflation.</p><p>According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, half of all drugs covered by Medicare between 2019 and 2020 had price increases above inflation.</p><p>Senate Democrats estimate the prescription drug parts of the plan would reduce federal spending by $288 billion over 10 years. It is unclear how much consumers would save.</p><p>Prescription drug prices account for roughly 1% of the overall inflation index measured by the Labor Department. In the past, prices have risen at a substantially higher rate than overall inflation, notably between 2014 and 2017. Over the past few months, however, prescription drug price increases have lagged behind overall inflation.</p><p>But many of the changes to drug prices aren't set to take full effect until later this decade, said Omair Sharif, president of Inflation Insights LLC. \"At the end of the day, this is a step in the right direction in terms of trying to lower inflationary pressures in the economy, but it's not clear this is going to have an immediate effect,\" he said.</p><p>The Senate framework could have some short-term effect on inflation if it holds down consumers' and businesses' expectations of future inflation, said Mr. Furman.</p><p>Economists closely follow inflation expectations because they can feed into actual inflation in the future. If workers and businesses expect inflation to accelerate, they will be more likely to ask for higher wages or raise their prices. Likewise, if they expect more moderate inflation they will perhaps accept slower wage and price increases.</p><p>Rapidly rising consumer prices over the past few months have started to push up consumer inflation expectations, according to the New York Fed.</p><p>Some analysts said parts of the plan could lower inflation expectations.</p><p>For instance, a provision to extend federal subsidies under the Affordable Care Act would continue to transfer some of the cost of health insurance from households to the federal government. Even if the total amount of money spent on health insurance under the ACA goes up, individuals would pay less than they otherwise would.</p><p>\"It's going to reduce the premium that people face, which is going to reduce their perception of the rise of health insurance,\" said Mr. Goldwein.</p><p>Andrew Duehren contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com</p><p>Manchin-Schumer Deal Would Have Moderate Inflation-Fighting Effect, Economists Say</p>",
