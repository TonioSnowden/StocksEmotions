  "text": "<p>Stocks wavered and commodity prices sank on Monday as the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus resurfaced doubts about the strength of the rebound of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/global-economy\">global economy</a>. </p> <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 ended the day down 0.1 per cent, hovering around the all-time high hit last week. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed 0.2 per cent higher. </p> <p>Energy stocks lagged, as oil added to last week's losses and investors worried that the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba4ab9a0-4e89-4979-b794-c7e5593724a6\">depress demand</a> for fuel. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell as much as 3 per cent on Monday to $67.60 a barrel, before recouping some of that weakness to trade at $69.27 a barrel.</p> <p>Since the beginning of this month, Brent has slid more than 9 per cent as China, one of the largest oil consumers in the world, tightened restrictions in an attempt to halt the transmission of the virus that has spread rapidly in Asia.</p> <p>“Any hiccup in China is going to have a huge impact on commodity markets by definition,” said Francisco Blanch, managing director at Bank of America. He added that the possibility of the US Federal Reserve tapering its $120 billion a month asset purchases soon was also a contributing factor to oil prices rolling back. </p> <p>Stocks in Asia edged up despite data released at the weekend showing China's imports and exports had slowed more than expected in July because of flooding and virus fears.</p> <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed up 0.4 per cent while the CSI 300 index of companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges gained 1.3 per cent. </p> <p>“We also don't expect a big economic impact from the Delta variant in the US and Europe,” noted Jan Hatzius at Goldman Sachs. “Asia-Pacific is a different story because the greater infectiousness of Delta poses a severe challenge to the region's combination of low vaccination rates and ambitious — in some cases zero — Covid goals.”</p> <p>In Europe, the region-wide Stoxx 600 index closed at another record high, up 0.2 per cent, having stayed in positive territory for six consecutive sessions. London's FTSE 100 index, which has a significant weighting of energy companies, rose by the same margin despite oil and mining groups such as BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Antofagasta following crude lower. </p> <p>Investors are also looking ahead to Wednesday's closely watched <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/7982616a-e179-45f1-86f6-948f1fc35523\">US inflation</a> numbers, which will help determine the path the Fed will take. Economists polled by Bloomberg forecast consumer prices to have ticked up 0.5 per cent in July over the month before, a slower pace than in June. On a year-on-year basis, the inflation rate is expected to have eased to 5.3 per cent from 5.4 per cent in June.</p> <p>A strong inflation reading will intensify speculation as to when the Fed will rein in its ultra-supportive policies, which have buttressed the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/us-economy\">economy</a> through the pandemic. </p> <p>US Treasury prices fell after Fed committee member Raphael Bostic on Monday said the US central bank could start to taper purchases between October and December, but that he “was open to moving it forward”.</p> <p>The yield on the 10-year note climbed 0.03 percentage points to 1.33 per cent following Bostic's remarks, having gained 0.07 percentage points on Friday after a better than expected <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ac7f7c4-c9ea-42e6-afed-57311fdc1b48\">US jobs report</a>. </p> <p>Gold fell as much as 4.1 per cent in Asia trading on Monday to $1,691 a troy ounce. “Gold corrected on Sunday night amidst low liquidity,” said Sébastien Galy, senior macro strategist&#xa0;at Nordea Asset Management. This can lead to outsized price movements, although it remained almost 2 per cent lower at $1,730 an ounce. </p><p>Source: Adrienne Klasa in London and Shubham Saharan in New York  2021 'Wall Street wavers as oil slips on growing Delta variant worries' FT.com 9 August.
