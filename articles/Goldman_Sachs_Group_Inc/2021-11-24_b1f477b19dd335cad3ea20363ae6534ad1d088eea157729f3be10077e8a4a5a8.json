  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Lime Rock's New Fund Buys Time  ----  By Luis Garcia",
  "text": "<p>   Lime Rock Partners wrapped up a $203 million fund that will give more time to its investment in a mineral-rights company that benefits from oil-and-gas production. </p><p>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s asset-management arm provided most of the fresh capital raised for the continuation fund, Lime Rock Partners VI AF, according to the firm. The vehicle has acquired assets of the firm's Lime Rock Partners VI LP, an older fund that closed in 2013 with $767 million, Lime Rock said. </p><p>   The fund has exited most of its other investments, according to the Westport, Conn.-based firm. </p><p>   Two entities owned by CrownRock Minerals LP -- a Midland, Texas, business that invests in mineral and royalty interests across the surrounding Permian Basin -- represent the majority of the assets transferred to the new fund, according to Lime Rock. CrownRock Minerals was formed in 2016 as a joint venture between Lime Rock and energy company CrownQuest Operating LLC. </p><p>   Goldman Sachs provided most of the $134 million in new commitments to the continuation fund, including co-investment capital, Lime Rock said. The investment manager backed the new fund with capital from its Vintage Funds strategy, which focuses on private-equity secondary deals, according to Lime Rock. </p><p>   Stakes rolled over from limited partners in the old fund accounted for roughly $69 million of the new vehicle's capital, said Jonathan Farber, a Lime Rock co-founder and managing director. </p><p>   Even as Lime Rock's Fund VI approached the end of its 10-year life, the firm believed it was too early to liquidate its CrownRock investment, as oil-and-gas companies are still developing the fields that underlie the holdings, Mr. Farber said. \"The mineral vehicles have a lot of growth and a lot of remaining value to add over time,\" he said. \"We wanted to offer investors the option of continuing to hold those vehicles,\" while also providing an exit alternative. </p><p>   Mineral and royalty rights are considered safer than direct energy investments because their owners get a portion of the revenue generated by underlying wells without having to help cover operating costs, industry consultants say. </p><p>   Those rights can also appeal to environmentally conscious investors looking for an indirect way to invest in oil and gas, said Rodney Reid, a managing director at investment bank Moelis &amp; Co. who leads its private-fund advisory practice. Mr. Reid helped Lime Rock raise the continuation fund. \"The mineral space is a step removed for some investors that have more sensitivities to being more directly invested in oil and gas businesses,\" he said. </p><p>   The new fund also reflects the exceptional growth of general partner-led secondary deals that enable private-equity firms to hold on to portfolio companies when a sale is deemed premature, Mr. Reid said. </p><p></p>",
