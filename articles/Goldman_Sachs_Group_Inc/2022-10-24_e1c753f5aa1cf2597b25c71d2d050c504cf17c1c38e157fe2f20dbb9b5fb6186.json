  "title": "You wait for ages and three come along at once; Rishi Sunak is anointed Britain's new prime minister",
  "text": "<p>BRITAIN HAS its third prime minister in two months: on October 25th King Charles III asked Rishi Sunak to form a government. Mr Sunak, a former chancellor of the exchequer, had been declared the new leader of the Conservative Party the previous day. He won a hurriedly organised contest without a single ballot being cast, by becoming the only MP to gather the 100 nominations needed to qualify for the race.</p><p>Mr Sunak does not promise a transformational programme. His task is to salvage Britain's fiscal credibility, suppress inflation and end the cycle of crisis that has consumed the Conservative Party. Mr Sunak is the party's fifth leader since the Brexit referendum of 2016. He helped bring down the third, Boris Johnson, by resigning from his cabinet in July as the weight of scandal surrounding Mr Johnson became too much to bear. He was beaten to be the fourth by Liz Truss, who triumphed in the summer's leadership campaign but announced her resignation as prime minister on October 20th after 44 calamitous days in office.</p><p>“The United Kingdom is a great country but there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,” said Mr Sunak, in an uncharacteristically stiff statement from the party's headquarters on October 24th. “We now need stability and unity and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.” If he can keep his job long enough to guide the Tories to nothing worse than a modest defeat at the next general election, he will have done well. A small Conservative majority would be a thing of wonder. The Tories are trailing the Labour Party by margins of over 30 points in the polls. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, is reckoned the better prime minister by 38% to 29%, according to a poll by YouGov; Sir Keir is rated better than his rival in 389 constituencies to Mr Sunak's 127.</p><p>Fraught though his task is, Mr Sunak enters office vindicated. A deficit hawk, he had spent the summer campaign warning that Ms Truss's package of unfunded tax cuts at a time of rising inflation amounted to a fairy tale. She did not listen, and her infamous “mini-budget” of unfunded tax cuts triggered a sharp sell-off in sterling and government debt that led to her own swift demise. British government-bond prices rose sharply as Mr Sunak's victory became apparent. In his first speech as prime minister, outside 10 Downing Street, he said that “mistakes were made” on Ms Truss's watch. “Not borne of ill will or bad intentions. Quite the opposite, in fact. But mistakes nonetheless.”One of his first decisions will be whether to keep in post Jeremy Hunt, who was appointed chancellor by Ms Truss to undo the damage caused by her budget. (Crispin Blunt, a supporter of Mr Sunak, has said it would be “inconceivable” to move him.) Mr Hunt has been preparing a programme of fiscal consolidation, which is due to be announced on October 31st; Mr Sunak must quickly decide whether to stick to that timetable, too.</p><p>The child of a doctor and a pharmacist of Indian descent, Mr Sunak is a first in a country that has never had a black or Asian prime minister. That is a matter of great pride to much of the Conservative Party; the Labour Party, which has only ever been led by white men, knows it looks behind the times on this score.</p><p>But Mr Sunak's great vulnerability is the fact that he is one of the winners from globalisation at a time when his party, and the country, have become much more animated by the fate of its losers. He met his wife, Akshata Murthy, whose father founded Infosys, an Indian technology giant, while studying for an MBA at Stanford University. He worked for spells at Goldman Sachs, a bank, and TCI, a hedge fund. Earlier this year it emerged that Ms Murthy was “non-domiciled” for tax purposes and that Mr Sunak had until recently held an American green card, allowing permanent residency in that country. His critics found both incidents politically naive, and his response to scrutiny of his family's financial and business interests surprisingly thin-skinned. “Both Will Smith and me having our wives attacked—at least I didn't get up and slap anybody,” he said at the time, a nod towards the actor's assault of Chris Rock, a comic.</p><p>He is sometimes imagined as a social liberal, perhaps because of his youth, affection for “Star Wars” and millennial vibes (in a recent interview he described eating “a lot of gluten” as one of his “vices”). Yet his CV is straight from Tory central casting: Winchester College, Oxford University and the true-blue farming constituency of Richmond, North Yorkshire.</p><p>First elected to Parliament in 2015, he was appointed a junior minister three years later and became chief secretary to the Treasury in 2019. His big breakthrough came in 2020 after Mr Johnson, then the prime minister, parted company with Sajid Javid, the chancellor; Mr Sunak was drafted in as his replacement in February of that year. His profile and popularity soared when covid-19 struck Britain a month later and he oversaw a generous and speedy furlough scheme. He owes his rise in part to backing “Leave” in the Brexit referendum of 2016, after which his pro-Remain colleagues and rivals found themselves out of favour. “Brexit became a test of faith that he passed, and his ascendancy was more rapid than it could or should have been,” says Tim Bale, a political scientist at Queen Mary, University of London.</p><p>As his polling faltered in the summer's contest against Liz Truss, he further embraced the right wing of his party. He pledged to cap the number of refugees Britain would accept. “I want to take on this lefty woke culture that seems to want to cancel our history, our values and our women,” he would repeat on the campaign trail. How far this represents his real instincts, and how far political expediency, has never been clear.</p><p>His principal focus as prime minister will be back in his old bailiwick of the public finances. Balancing the books will involve taking some deeply unpopular decisions: tax rises and spending cuts are on the way. Yet there is a growing consensus in the party that, barring calamities, it cannot afford to jettison yet another leader this side of an election. Mr Johnson's hold over the Conservatives has certainly weakened considerably. The former prime minister had tried to claim back his old job, flying back from his holiday in the Dominican Republic to drum up votes from the party that had once worshipped him. They did not materialise. (“Demeaning” was the verdict of Iain Duncan Smith, another former leader.) “The volatility has come about because they've always thought they can get rid of X and put in Y,” says Mr Bale.</p><p>By law, Mr Sunak does not need to call an election before January 2025. But he may feel compelled to go much sooner. Mr Sunak was elevated to Downing Street after winning a leadership contest conducted without a single public appearance. The Labour Party insists he must call a general election if he hopes to govern with any authority. In a poll conducted on the day of his coronation by YouGov, 56% of the public agreed that he should call an early ballot. As he moves to fill the fiscal hole left behind by Ms Truss, thereby exacerbating the country's cost-of-living crisis, those demands will grow louder. Britain's new prime minister will last longer than the outgoing one. But a long stay seems unlikely.</p><p>■</p>",
