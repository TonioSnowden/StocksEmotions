  "title": "U.S. News: Gensler Confirmed as SEC Chief",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Gensler takes the job at a hectic time for markets. The stock market continues to break records, while individual investors make risky bets on some stocks such as GameStop. In addition, more companies are gaining access to public markets through special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, which require less disclosure than traditional IPOs.</p><p>\"Any chairman comes to the SEC with their ideas of what they want their priorities to be,\" said David Grim, a partner at Stradley Ronon Stevens &amp; Young who formerly served as an SEC division director. \"But those priorities are in some ways at the mercy of what's happening in the markets at the time.\"</p><p>A onetime Goldman Sachs executive, Mr. Gensler is known in Washington as a hard-nosed regulator who succeeded in overhauling the swaps market after the financial crisis. The rules he implemented as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 2009 to 2013 are widely credited with shoring up the market's resilience during last year's turmoil amid the pandemic.</p><p>Progressives who supported his nomination are hopeful that Mr. Gensler will pursue a similarly ambitious agenda at the SEC, a 4,300-employee agency that polices the stock market and dictates disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies.</p><p>\"The SEC has been asleep on the job for long enough,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) told Mr. Gensler during his confirmation hearing in the Senate Banking Committee in March. \"It's time for the commission to get up off its behind and protect investors and consumers.\"</p><p>At the top of Democrats' priority list for the SEC is requiring companies to disclose more information about risks they face from climate change, an approach to which Mr. Gensler has expressed openness. The agency, now led by acting Chairwoman Allison Herren Lee, said last month it plans to increase scrutiny of companies that mislead investors when touting socially responsible strategies.</p><p>\"There's tens of trillions of dollars of invested assets that are looking for more information about climate risk,\" Mr. Gensler said during his hearing. \"I think then the SEC has a role to play to help bring some consistency and comparability to those guidelines.\"</p><p>Conservatives warn that saddling public companies with additional requirements could hamper their competitiveness. \"I'm concerned [Mr. Gensler] will cause the SEC to use its regulatory powers to advance a liberal social agenda,\" said Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.).</p>",
