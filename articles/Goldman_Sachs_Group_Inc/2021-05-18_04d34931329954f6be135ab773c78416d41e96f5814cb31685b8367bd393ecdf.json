  "text": "<p>Former Goldman Sachs chief economist and ex-Treasury minister<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/jim-oneill\"> Lord Jim O'Neill</a> has become the controlling shareholder of Second Home, the flexible office provider hoping to take advantage of a surge of interest after the pandemic.</p> <p>The House of Lords peer has taken a stake of about 35 per cent in the business, which was founded by a former adviser to ex-British prime minister David Cameron. The change of controlling shareholding was revealed in Companies House filings on Tuesday.</p> <p>O'Neill confirmed his increased stake in Second Home when contacted by the Financial Times, and said he would also support the growth of the business with a “modest” cash injection.</p> <p>“Its got very big potential,” he said. “The growth of flexible offices will be one of the major consequences of the pandemic and I hope to help grow it in a sensible way.”</p> <p>The move follows a period of turmoil at the start-up, which has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29f7a29d-cfd7-34fd-a6ed-96a293f18a0e\">struggled to open new sites</a> and was forced to seek funding in 2019 after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3cf4051c-fa72-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6\">heavy cost overruns</a> on its space in Los Angeles. The Covid-19 pandemic has added it to its woes as potential customers have worked from home.</p> <p>O'Neill, a former economist and government minister who coined the acronym Brics for Brazil, Russia, Indian and China,&#xa0;has been a shareholder in the business since it was launched. </p> <p>He has acquired the extra shares from Gerard Chan, the real estate investor, according to a person familiar with the matter. O'Neill will put one of his team on the board as chair of the group.&#xa0;</p> <p>Second Home opened its first site in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fb712a4c-8767-31ca-b25a-49e0b4093f2c\">east London</a> in 2014. It now has three other buildings in London, another in Lisbon and its Los Angeles site.</p> <p>Its co-founder, Rohan Silva, who was a tech and start-up policy adviser for Cameron, will remain as chief executive. Silva was not available for comment.</p> <p>The valuation at which O'Neill bought the shares was unclear. Pembroke VCT, another of Second Home's investors, currently values the start-up at <a href=\"https://www.pembrokevct.com/?portfolio=second-home\">£26m</a>, far below the <a href=\"https://www.pembrokevct.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pembroke-VCT-Annual-Report-2019.pdf\">£130m</a> it marked the company at in early 2019. </p> <p>Pembroke had already taken a writedown on its investment before the pandemic, with <a href=\"https://www.rns-pdf.londonstockexchange.com/rns/8816W_1-2019-12-13.pdf\">results</a> released in December 2019 stating that Second Home was among its investments whose “performance has fallen short of our expectations”.</p> <p>The firm has also taken money from the government's Future Fund, according to a person familiar with the matter. This offered convertible loans to start-ups that needed funds during the pandemic, which could then become equity stakes for the government after the next fundraising.</p> <p>Second Home's other co-founder, Sam Aldenton, left the company in early 2020. He sold his shares shortly before the pandemic hit the company's valuation, according to two people familiar with the matter.<br><br>The start-up has raised more than £60m in the past from other investors including Martin Lau, Tencent president, and venture capitalist Yuri Milner as well as Atomico.</p><p>Source: Daniel Thomas and Kadhim Shubber in London 2021 'Jim O'Neill takes control at flexible office start-up Second Home' FT.com 18 May.
