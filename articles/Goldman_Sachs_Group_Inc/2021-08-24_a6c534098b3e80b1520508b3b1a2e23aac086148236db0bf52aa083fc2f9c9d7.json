  "title": "TPG Moving Forward With Initial Public Offering Plan; The firm has come close to launching an IPO multiple times in the past, only to end up deciding against it",
  "text": "<p>The firm, which at the time was considering both a straightforward IPO and a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, is moving forward with the former and has been drafting paperwork it plans to file confidentially with regulators in the coming weeks, some of the people said. That could set up the shares to start trading by year-end.</p><p>\"We continue to evaluate strategic alternatives and have nothing to announce at this time,\" a TPG spokesman said in a statement.</p><p>With headquarters in San Francisco and Fort Worth, Texas, and offices around the world, TPG manages nearly $100 billion in assets. The firm, one of the last of the original buyout giants to remain a private partnership, has come close to launching an IPO multiple times in the past, only to end up deciding against it.</p><p>This time, TPG seems determined to see the plan throughâ€”though there is no guarantee, especially given that the red-hot IPO market could cool at any time.</p><p>Jon Winkelried, who was president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman before joining TPG in 2015, became the firm's sole chief executive in May. Earlier this month, TPG named firm veteran Jack Weingart to the role of chief financial officer.</p><p>Shares of publicly traded private-equity firms, including Blackstone Group Inc., KKR &amp; Co., Carlyle Group Inc. and Apollo Global Management Inc., have been on a tear recently as their investment portfolios benefit from a rising stock market and they amass \"permanent capital,\" which generates steady management fees.</p><p>TPG, for its part, has scored big on early-stage investments in new-economy stalwarts including Airbnb Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc.</p><p>Other private-market investment firms have seized the moment and staged IPOs. European private-equity firm Bridgepoint Group PLC listed shares in London last month, and Blue Owl Capital Inc. was formed in May through a merger with a SPAC.</p><p>Many are taking a page from Sweden's EQT AB, which went public in 2019 and trades at a significantly higher multiple than its larger brethren, due in large part to its fee structure, which exposes shareholders to more of the steady and growing management fees they prize.</p><p>Write to Miriam Gottfried at Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com, Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@wsj.com and Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com</p><p>TPG Moving Forward With Initial Public Offering Plan</p>",
