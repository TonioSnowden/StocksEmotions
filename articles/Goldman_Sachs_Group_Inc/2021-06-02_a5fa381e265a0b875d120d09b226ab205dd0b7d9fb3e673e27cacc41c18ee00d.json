  "text": "<p>Meme stocks favoured by retail investors soared on Wednesday in a session that saw a large uptick in derivatives trading.</p> <p>Companies targeted by retail investors rallied, including the cinema chain AMC, the software group BlackBerry and the retailer GameStop all gained more than 10 per cent. AMC shares almost doubled in value by the end of the day.</p> <p>An index run by Goldman Sachs that tracks the changes in the shares of companies most frequently mentioned on the r/WallStreetBets page on Reddit —&#xa0;a popular online forum for day traders — rose by more than a 25 per cent. It is up 60 per cent over the past two weeks.</p> <p>The Goldman index counts AMC, BlackBerry and GameStop among constituents including the technology group Microvision and Quicken Loans parent Rocket Companies. </p> <p>The broader market ended the session little changed. The blue-chip S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.2 per cent while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite edged 0.1 per cent higher. Just over half of the 505 stocks within the S&amp;P 500 advanced on Wednesday.</p> <p>The trading on Wall Street was again accompanied by a surge of buying of call options on Wednesday, which can pay off if a stock or exchange traded fund rises in value. Call option trading volumes rose to the highest level since early March, with AMC call option activity hitting a record high, according to Bloomberg data.</p> <p>Traders in Europe also sent stocks in the continent to new records. The region-wide Stoxx Europe 600, which reached an all-time high on Tuesday, gained 0.3 per cent, boosted by energy stocks. </p> <p>Paris's CAC 40 and the Xetra Dax in Frankfurt both advanced and closed up 0.5 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively. Across the Channel, London's FTSE 100 ended the session 0.4 per cent higher. </p> <p>Rupert Thompson, chief investment officer at Kingswood, said the resilience of equity markets was surprising given the lack of specific good news to push them up. “We're now in June, typically the weakest month of the year,” he said. “In a way, they're overdue a pause.”</p> <p>Investors continued to weigh whether recent upticks in inflation would prove transitory, as central bankers have argued, or structural. Eurozone flash core inflation readings came in at 2 per cent this week for the first time since 2018, pushing at the edges of the European Central Bank's target range. </p> <p>Despite this, most analysts predict the ECB will maintain its €80bn monthly bond purchase programme when it meets next week. “We expect the ECB to look through the May print and [second half of 2021] hump in inflation . . . and focus on the medium-term outlook for inflation,” analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote.</p> <p>In the US, where the recovery is more advanced, some investors fear the risk of overheating is more serious, potentially pushing the Federal Reserve to tighten its monetary policy. </p> <p>“It seems to me that the inflation risk is very much concentrated in the US and [is] going to get worse before it gets better,” said Thompson.</p> <p>The yields on the 10-year US Treasury, which have risen from around 0.9 per cent at the start of this year in anticipation of higher consumer prices, slid 0.02 percentage points to 1.59 per cent on Wednesday. </p> <p>Oil prices, which this week have neared their highest level since the pandemic began, maintained their gains following a meeting by Opec+ in which members stuck to their plan to gradually release more barrels into the market. </p> <p>Brent crude, the global benchmark, settled 1.6 per cent higher at $71.35 a barrel. The US marker, West Texas Intermediate, also jumped 1.6 per cent to $68.83 a barrel.</p><p>Source: Siddharth Venkataramakrishnan in London and Eric Platt in New York 2021 'Meme stocks take off as call option buying surges ' FT.com 2 June.
