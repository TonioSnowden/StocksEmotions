  "text": "<p>Deliveroo shrugged off proposed new rules from Brussels that might lead to gig workers being reclassified as employees as the food delivery group reported growth at the top end of its expected range last year. </p> <p>London-based Deliveroo said on Thursday that gross transaction value — a measure of customer spending — rose 70 per cent. Its previous guidance, which had already been upgraded, was for growth of 60 to 70 per cent.</p> <p>Gross transaction value, primarily made up of customers' spending through its app, was £6.6bn in the period. This excluded the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8f2292bb-1ccc-47f2-ad8a-6b5cd659a647\">contribution from Spain</a>, which Deliveroo withdrew from in November as the country adopted legislation that gave gig economy workers employee rights. </p> <p>The European Commission <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c1d681a-023b-47b3-b416-eab0b3b9042c\">published draft legislation</a> in December which proposes new rules that may lead to independent contractors in Europe being entitled to employee status and benefits.</p> <p>Deliveroo previously told investors in its IPO prospectus that they would be “adversely affected” if legislative changes required them to change the status of their riders to employees.</p> <p>Will Shu, chief executive, said on Thursday he was “positive about the proposals” as he believed they would “confirm that the majority [of riders] are self-employed. Member states will interpret things differently.”</p> <p>He added: “There may or may not be an impact on unit economics but if riders were employees then you would counteract by operating an employee fleet.”</p> <p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs said there was risk that riders might be required to become employees in some markets with “additional costs not being offset by pricing or productivity increases”.<br><br>The company delivered 40.4m meals and groceries in the UK and Ireland and said that the average monthly frequency of orders placed increased from 3.2 to 3.4 during the last quarter of 2021. Coverage of the UK population climbed to 77 per cent in December 2021, up from 53 per cent at the end of 2020.</p> <p>Deliveroo floated at 390p per share in London in April but the shares <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bdf6ac6b-46b5-4f7a-90db-291d7fd2898d\">fell sharply</a> on the first day of trading. They closed on Wednesday at 170p and rose 1.8 per cent on Thursday morning. <br><br>Deliveroo said that its gross margins for the year would be in line with the expected range of 7.5 to 7.75 per cent.</p><p>Source: Jyoti Mann and Oliver Ralph in London 2022 'Deliveroo serves up sharp rise in 2021 orders' FT.com 20 January.
