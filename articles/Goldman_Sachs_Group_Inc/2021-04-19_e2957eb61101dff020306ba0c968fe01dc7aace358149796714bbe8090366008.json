And as economies reopen, businesses hope some of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8cbfe40d-1ce1-4dc6-bcb2-1314b77b9443\">$5.4bn in savings stockpiled</a> by households across the world will come their way in a post-pandemic spending splurge.&#xa0;</p> <p>Credit rating agency Moody's, which compiled the savings data, estimates that if consumers spent about a third of this spare cash, global output would benefit by more than 2 percentage points this year and next. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said: “The combination of an unleashing of significant pent-up demand and overflowing excess saving will drive a surge in consumer spending across the globe as countries approach herd immunity and open up.”</p> <p>The findings echo analysis from the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e7b5c88-937c-445f-859c-2f9653332afe\">Bank of England</a> last week, which calculated Britons had saved an extra £180bn in their bank accounts during the crisis, or almost 10 per cent of the UK's annual gross domestic product.</p> <p>Two important caveats need to be added. Firstly, the impact of the pandemic has been highly unequal. Jan Hatzius, economist at Goldman Sachs, estimated that nearly two-thirds of excess savings in the US were held by the richest 40 per cent of the population, possibly limiting the economic boost because high-income households will hold rather than spend the bulk of them.</p> <p>Secondly, as the current situation in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e81875ef-4c78-4f63-b53c-e8458688f6b2\">India</a> amply illustrates,&#xa0;a resurgence in infections can easily turn hopes of swift economic recovery to dust.</p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p>President <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7dd0533c-ad9a-40cb-951e-ec829451cc6d\">Sebastián Piñera</a> told the FT that <strong>Chile</strong> could recover all the growth lost to Covid-19 this year — in stark contrast to the rest of Latin America — thanks to a successful vaccination campaign and growing demand for copper, its main export. According to the <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker/?areas=gbr&amp;areas=isr&amp;areas=usa&amp;areas=eue&amp;cumulative=1&amp;populationAdjusted=1\">FT Vaccine Tracker</a>, the country lies only behind Israel and Bahrain (both with much smaller populations) in the jabs league table.</p> <p>Countries in <strong>Central Asia</strong>, attempting to recover from their first recession since transitioning from the Soviet system in the mid-1990s, have been hit hard by falls in gas revenues from China as well as the slow pace of vaccination. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79ccf363-942a-4be9-8a18-df0e91bcee5b\">Remittances</a> from workers in Russia, which amount to up to 30 per cent of GDP in some countries, act as a crucial lifeline.</p> <p>The <strong>Vatican</strong>, the smallest independent country in the world, is not immune from pandemic economic shock. An expected 30 per cent <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bfcb6092-fd51-42a4-91e3-415eb08d3b4a\">fall in revenues</a> for this year means salary cuts for cardinals, a slowdown in renovation work and a reduction in international travel. </p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>A group of Europe's leading <strong>football clubs</strong>, stung by steep drops in revenue during the pandemic, is planning to set up a breakaway <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4cbef20a-7599-4580-82aa-2af383bd0f5a\">Super League</a>. The proposals have been ferociously attacked by football authorities and fans, who fear it would resemble the “closed” sports leagues of North America, where franchise owners can enjoy reliable profits without the fear of relegation to lower tiers. <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/5e5e3d297600b40004c209fc/subscribe?emailId=5ed9b5ebf1b3d60004d2a3a6&amp;segmentId=22011ee7-896a-8c4c-22a0-7603348b7f22\"><em>Sign up here</em></a><em> for Scoreboard, our must-read weekly briefing on the business of sport.</em></p> <p>The lifting of restaurant restrictions and a successful US vaccination campaign helped <strong>Coca-Cola</strong> regain some of its fizz in the first quarter, with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe0ca86d-4c42-4323-ab33-ec9b8a75cb65\">case volumes</a> back at levels last seen in 2019.</p> <p>Post-pandemic restructuring of the workspace has reached new heights: <strong>HSBC bosses</strong> are being evicted from the 42nd floor of their Canary Wharf London HQ to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4984410c-e6fe-41d6-9d66-67ee54188f38\">hotdesk</a> with their lower-ranking colleagues two-floors below. New official data showed those <strong>working from home</strong> in the UK clocked up almost twice as much <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/339f6f2f-2132-41af-a547-d8a4c72ca822#post-8ebaddd7-b195-4172-83db-c8fc04e13dc3\">unpaid overtime</a> as those who do not. </p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p>Fears that <strong>India's</strong> economic recovery will crumble in the face of an alarming <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e81875ef-4c78-4f63-b53c-e8458688f6b2\">resurgence in infections</a> have sent the rupee diving since the start of April. Share prices have also been hit and foreign investors are selling Indian assets on concerns for the country's growth prospects.</p> <p>After a turbulent trading period for <strong>government bonds</strong>, the revival of systemic risks to the global financial system means they are regaining their status as safety nets, writes markets editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59bb5713-fb16-4344-8f7f-348616bfd36b\">Katie Martin</a>. </p> <p>The latest in our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/f0a29340-05dc-4ab0-9f3b-4628b2024c77\">Charts that Matter</a> series shows the potential for disappointment if <strong>US earnings</strong> in the first quarter fail to live up to their blowout expectations. “If the optimism gets too high, even in a really good earnings season, the market could actually go down because there's a lot fewer upside surprises,” said an executive at brokerage Charles Schwab.</p> <h2>Have your say</h2> <p>Mr Just Saying comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78251372-b2ba-4916-b086-c80d2c0006ec?commentID=fdf1a15b-f274-4033-9811-07203177ccba\">EU plans ticket to ride for battered tourism industry</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>The rollout of the digital green certificate is likely to be messy and might fail. Travellers already need a negative PCR test for travel to many EU countries. And who is going to validate the vaccination received outside Europe? In theory, there should be no difference between Europeans that received their vaccine in Europe, or say, in the US. But those vaccinated in the US only have a simple CDC card, prone to counterfeiting with online sales already booming. So creating a coherent travel system with vaccine proof in time for summer travel is likely to be operationally challenging. The best bet is a simple solution: Have everybody that wants to travel abroad take a PCR test, at maximum 72h before arrival, irrespective of vaccine status or antibodies. </p> </blockquote> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p>“Crazy, queasy, disruptive, cabin-fevered, intriguing.” The UK's museums still have a month to wait before they can reopen, but <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ad6cd59-dc7d-4e03-8d8f-2067120f9bd5\">private galleries</a> have already opened their doors and offer a revealing display of how a “new normal” of trauma and isolation has shaped recent art, writes critic Jackie Wullschläger.</p> <p><em>We would really like to hear from you.
