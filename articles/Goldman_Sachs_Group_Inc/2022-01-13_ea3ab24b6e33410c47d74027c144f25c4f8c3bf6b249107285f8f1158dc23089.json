A new band of climate activists is betting that they can put pressure on some of those clients by dragging their PR <em>consiglieri</em> into the headlines.</p> <p>As the FT's Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson explains <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f90562d6-6673-457a-901e-257eb4578d98\">here</a>, this is a new tactic in the environmental movement: going after the advisers who help oil, gas and other high-emitting companies shape their messages.</p> <p>Groups such as <strong>Clean Creatives</strong> hope that by naming and shaming the PR firms and ad agencies that work for fossil fuel groups, they can starve those companies of the talent on which they depend to influence climate debates.</p> <p>Other advisers are facing similar pressure from their own people or prospective recruits. Last year, more than 1,100 employees at scandal-hit consulting firm <strong>McKinsey</strong> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/business/mckinsey-climate-change.html\">asked</a> whether its work with heavily polluting clients was harming its reputation, while US law school students have urged a boycott of law firm <strong>Gibson Dunn </strong>over its energy work.</p> <p>The approach has echoes of past campaigns against banks and asset managers, where activists aim to starve of capital the oil and gas companies they invest in or finance.</p> <p>Will it work? One of Clean Creatives' first targets,<strong> Edelman</strong>, has just responded by producing a new set of principles governing which clients it will take on. The world's largest PR firm says it will only work with companies that are committed to accelerating action towards net zero emissions. </p> <p>Asked whether that would mean dropping clients such as <strong>ExxonMobil</strong> and<strong> Shell</strong>, chief executive <strong>Richard Edelman</strong> said it may “part company” with some clients. So far though, it has not dumped any clients, nor sworn off any sector.</p> <p>Other PR firms have felt the fallout from harsh headlines about fossil fuel work. A New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/climate/fti-consulting.html\">story</a> last year alleging ethical red flags in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e23b1e17-6a5a-4e18-bd0a-5ad289dfc05c\"><strong>FTI Consulting</strong></a>'s work for oil groups prompted reviews by the <strong>Carbon Disclosure Project</strong>, <strong>Morningstar</strong> and <strong>MSCI</strong>. All three confirmed to the FT's Camilla Hodgson that they no longer work with FTI.</p> <p>Fossil fuel companies should be able to communicate the steps they're taking in the carbon transition, <strong>Mark Read</strong>, head of <strong>WPP</strong>, told investors last year. But he admitted that public scepticism of the substance behind the sustainability spin was an issue, “particularly in this age of social media, which calls out greenwashing very clearly”.</p> <p>Climate activists know how thick-skinned oil tycoons can be (see <strong>Derek Brower</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93dffdd3-45f3-4628-b3b6-8204f1dd5777\">Lunch with the FT</a> with shale billionaire <strong>Harold Hamm</strong>). Now they're hoping that the young creatives who staff the industry's PR and advertising firms will be more sensitive to criticism. </p> <p>For more from Derek and the US energy team sign up for FT's Energy Source newsletter <a href=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/subscribe?newsletterIds=5655d099e4b01077e911d60f\">here</a>.</p> <h2>Houston, do we have a problem?</h2> <p>At least there's a good airport. Top US bankruptcy lawyers are accustomed to taking the subway to downtown Manhattan or perhaps the Amtrak Acela to Wilmington, Delaware when their clients file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. But they may now instead find themselves trekking down to Houston, Texas.</p> <p>In 2020, the<strong> Southern District of Texas</strong> was the top venue selected by large Chapter 11 filers ahead of traditional leaders New York and Delaware, according to data analysed by the FT.</p> <p>DD's Sujeet Indap explores the world of blockbuster bankruptcy filings <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41c8bfa9-a60b-43a2-917d-323b3ee5e19d\">in this deep-dive</a>, and how two Texas judges became the favourites of elite restructuring law firms in recent years. </p> <p>The city handled 41 cases in 2020 — more than any other venue in the US — with major cases including <strong>JCPenney</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a2a2e7d-f671-4b07-af8b-9b0d43ef6576\"><strong>Neiman Marcus</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85d99318-ff2f-4ed7-9b6e-951dacd7b584\"><strong>Chesapeake Energy</strong></a>. Richmond, Virginia and the Western District of North Carolina also emerged as popular destinations.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8330440.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Supporters of the status quo, in which companies have vast flexibility to pick which court oversees their reorganisation, say that only a few judges have the sophistication to handle the most complex situations involving private equity and hedge fund brawls. </p> <p>Cynics, on the other hand, say that judges tend to go soft in order to keep the big hitters coming back to their courtrooms in subsequent cases.</p> <p>OxyContin maker <strong>Purdue Pharma</strong> was all but guaranteed its 2019 case would be overseen by <strong>Judge Robert Drain</strong> after choosing a court in Westchester county, New York. That case influenced the <strong>Southern District of New York</strong>'s decision to randomise selection across all nine of its bankruptcy judges.</p> <p>In Houston, judges <strong>David Jones</strong> and <strong>Marvin Isgur</strong> rose to popularity in part for their expertise managing complex balance sheet restructurings.</p> <p>Lawyers say there's an advantage to knowing which judge will preside over a given case.</p> <p>“My clients look to us for our advice and experience with particular judges and courts. For example, they want to know that I have seen this judge handle a case like this,” said Freshfields partner <strong>Madlyn Primoff</strong>.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/7149670.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Congress members including <strong>John Cornyn</strong>, a Texas Republican, and <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong>, a Massachusetts Democrat, have <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-cornyn-introduce-bill-to-prevent-large-corporations-from-forum-shopping-in-bankruptcy-cases\">proposed legislation</a> that would force companies to file bankruptcy petitions near their core operations.</p> <p>In a Zoom world, such a system may end up being perfectly convenient. But at some point, lawyers may be landing at small airports.</p> <h2>Didi sputters towards another IPO</h2> <p>When the Chinese government launched an investigation into New York-listed ride-hailing group <strong>Didi Chuxing</strong> in July, it also popped the tires of Wall Street dealmakers riding high on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bba86de5-1da4-4b5a-bb40-6ff71c18cb7b\">record fees</a> from deals involving Chinese companies.</p> <p>Bankers in Hong Kong could soon see some of that cash. More than six months after its disastrous US IPO, Didi is switching gears to list in the Chinese territory, but must first navigate a number of roadblocks hampering a smooth listing process, the FT's Ryan McMorrow and Sun Yu and DD's Arash Massoudi <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7faaa91e-e190-4e98-aeab-f1287aedd21d\">have learned</a>.</p> <p>The so-called “<strong>Uber</strong> of China” has begun informal discussions with the Hong Kong stock exchange about a public listing, said two people familiar with the situation.</p> <p>The road is paved with uncertainty. Beijing's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/deac99c5-502e-4432-8450-495fcc6619e2\">investigation</a> into data security at Didi has yet to be resolved. And it has struggled to obtain the correct permits for its business and drivers in several Chinese cities.</p> <p>For Didi, it's do or die. The company's shares, which began trading at $14, have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/695b5519-983f-4e44-a9c0-7e1cf1eca525\">plummeted</a> to $4.90, having lost more than $40bn in market value. Its losses have swelled to $7.6bn in the first nine months of last year, and the company is on track to burn through its cash pile and short-term investments by the middle of 2023.</p> <p>Beijing's blessing could make or break Didi's aspirations. The FT's source close to Didi's executive team said the Hong Kong exchange wanted the company to be fully compliant in 70 to 80 per cent of the company's 100 biggest Chinese cities, a goal that's still far from reach, according to Chinese regulators.</p> <p>Didi is rushing to appease the government by courting state-backed investors including rival ride-hailing group<strong> Shouqi</strong> and state-owned conglomerate <strong>Citic</strong>, while also lobbying the Hong Kong exchange to lower its compliance requirements.</p> <p>The question is: can it pull that off before it runs out of gas? </p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Melissa Sawyer</strong> has been promoted to global head of M&amp;A at <strong>Sullivan &amp; Cromwell</strong>. She succeeds <strong>Frank Aquila</strong>, who is now the firm's senior M&amp;A partner and will remain on the management committee.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Credit Suisse</strong> has named<strong> Oliver Tucker </strong>as head of wealth management investment banking UK coverage. He was previously a managing director at <strong>Nomura</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group</strong> has hired <strong>Jess Sodaski</strong> as a managing director and head of investment grade credit sales. He joins in New York after spending two decades at Credit Suisse.</p></li>  <li><p>Venture capital firm <strong>Kleiner Perkins</strong> has promoted investors<strong> Annie Case</strong> and <strong>Josh Coyne </strong>to partner.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Linklaters </strong>has hired supreme court lawyer <strong>Bart Fleuren</strong> as counsel in its Amsterdam dispute resolution practice. He was most recently a senior associate at <strong>De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Skipping town </strong>Brexit has pushed EU traders out of Britain and into up-and-coming hubs such as Paris and Frankfurt. Now, Wall Street giants like JPMorgan Chase have joined the party in Europe too, throwing the City of London's financial dominance into uncertainty.
