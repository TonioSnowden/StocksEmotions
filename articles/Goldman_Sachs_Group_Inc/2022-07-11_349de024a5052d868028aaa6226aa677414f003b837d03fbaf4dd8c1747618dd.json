  "text": "<p>Working with sister publication IBD to find the 25 Most Trusted Financial Companies is a first for MarketWatch.</p><p>However, IBD's most-trusted list made its debut in 2020 to help consumers decide where to turn for financial products and services, a mission that aligns with MarketWatch's aim of offering tools and services to the masses that help to democratize access to and understanding of financial markets.</p><p>This year, we will be asking which companies rank highest on eight trust attributes — up from five in 2021 — that customers said they considered most important in an initial phase of this survey among thousands of consumers.</p><p>Those attributes:</p><p>* Quality of products and services</p><p>* Ethical business practices and values</p><p>* Commitment to protecting the privacy and security of personal data</p><p>* Company's service/treatment of others</p><p>* Fair prices/fees for products and services</p><p>* Sensitivity to customer needs in the current economic and financial climate (inflation, stock market, etc.)</p><p>* Innovation of processes and offerings</p><p>* Treatment of employees</p><p>In 2021, Cathie Wood's ARK Invest ranked No. 24 overall on the list, but the fund company's flagship Ark Innovation exchange-traded fund ARKK is down by more than 50% in 2022, as speculative assets take it on the chin, amid a new regime of punchy inflation and rising interest rates.</p><p>This year's survey comes as the S&amp;P 500 SPX and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rang up their worst first-half performances in more than 50 years and only recently red-hot crypto markets dramatically unraveled.</p><p>Michael Novogratz, the Galaxy Digital CA:GLXY BRPHF founder and former Goldman Sachs banker, said it isn't just a bear market in the traditional sense of the word — but also a \"bear market in trust,\" in a recent interview, referring to what he believed to be the pervading sentiment among investors.</p><p>We'll release the results, and details on this year's methodology, on Aug. 29, so please take the survey here.</p><p>TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence is helping to conduct the survey.</p><p>The hunt for America's most trusted financial brands kicks off now, as the stock market's collapse ushers in a bear market in trust</p>",
