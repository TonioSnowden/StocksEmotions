OPEC+ has resisted calls by the Biden administration and other energy-consuming countries to more rapidly boost output.</p><p>The U.S. SPR release could relieve the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia from bringing spare capacity into production, said Steeves.</p><p>Elsewhere, Russia is reportedly offering hefty discounts of its oil to India, amid sagging demand due to those sanctions, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, citing sources.</p><p>See also: War in Ukraine: Heavy fighting rages near Kyiv as Russia appears to regroup</p><p>Supply data</p><p>The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported on Thursday that domestic natural-gas supplies climbed by 26 billion cubic feet for the week ended March 25.
