  "text": "<p>The agricultural giant is the latest company to announce plans to shrink its workforce as costs for labor, raw materials and transportation pressure businesses. Ford Motor Co. said last month it would shed 3,000 jobs, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recently said it was preparing to lay off hundreds of employees.</p><p>Crop seed and chemical suppliers such as Corteva and rival Bayer AG have been raising prices on products sold to farmers to offset their own rising costs, company executives have said. Corteva officials said Tuesday that it plans to exit from about 35 countries and focus on 110 countries, especially 20 of its key regions, such as North America, Europe and Brazil.</p><p>\"Historically, we've tried to be everything everywhere,\" said Robert King, executive vice president of Corteva's crop protection business.</p><p>Indianapolis-based Corteva, which moved its headquarters from Delaware earlier this year, said last month that it expects $400 million in restructuring charges through the second quarter of 2023 as it plans to exit from certain geographies and various product lines. The company said it expects to generate more than $200 million in run-rate savings by 2025.</p><p>On Tuesday, Corteva officials said that part of the restructuring plan aims to simplify its business by focusing on developing five core crop groups: fruits and vegetables, soy, cereals, corn and rice. The company said it plans to invest about 8% of its sales in research and development.</p><p>\"We're going to balance the portfolio with new products coming out of the pipeline and filling the gaps with strategic partnerships in biologicals and seed applied technologies,\" said Mr. King.</p><p>In its most recent quarter that ended June 30, Corteva recorded $68 million in restructuring charges, $45 million of which related to its decision to exit from the Russian market following the invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Corteva also said it plans to repurchase about $2 billion in shares. The repurchase program is in addition to its existing $1.5 billion program announced in 2021, which had $650 million remaining at the end of June, the company said.</p><p>Write to Patrick Thomas at Patrick.Thomas@wsj.com</p><p>Agriculture Company Corteva Plans to Lay Off 5% of Global Workforce</p>",
