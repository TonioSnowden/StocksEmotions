Friday's losses for Wall Street came as a reading on consumer sentiment held close to&#xa0;a roughly 10-year low.</p><p>Analysts also were discussing the inability, so far, of Congress to increase the debt ceiling.</p><p>“We are probably out of the Goldilocks stages, where stocks were putting in a straight line higher,” said Michael Reynolds, investment strategy officer at Glenmede, in a phone interview. “This is almost a return to normal.”</p><p>Reynolds said discord in Washington, including over President Biden's planned $3.5 trillion spending plan could mean “volatility is here for now.” But he also thinks the fundamentals of the economic recovery remain “in relatively good shape,” meaning that a sustained pullback might make for a good time to add risk.</p><p>Read: It is the ‘golden age' of U.S. consumer credit, says this Voya portfolio manager</p><p>Investors were also weighing an upbeat report from Pfizer Inc.
