  "title": "Goldman Sachs Profit Rises on Deal Bonanza; Wall Street firm's investment bankers had their second-best quarter on record",
  "text": "<p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. released some of the money they had set aside to deal with pandemic losses, a sign of their confidence in the bumpy economic recovery.</p><p>Goldman CEO David Solomon said on a call with analysts that he believes the pandemic's worst effects on the global economy are likely over but that some risks remain. Congress, for example, is heading toward another debt-ceiling standoff and deadlocked over infrastructure proposals.</p><p>Goldman executives are paying close attention to Washington developments and inflation, the Delta variant and the \"complicated\" U.S.-China relationship, Mr. Solomon said.</p><p>\"Taken together, these items have the potential to be a headwind to growth,\" Mr. Solomon said.</p><p>That hasn't stopped the deal making party. Goldman's investment bankers brought in $3.7 billion in fees, the second-best quarter on record and 88% higher than a year ago. They earned $1.65 billion just from advising on mergers and acquisitions, a quarterly record and more than triple the year-ago results. Advisory fees also more than tripled at Morgan Stanley and Citigroup, and more than doubled at JPMorgan.</p><p>Companies that went into survival mode when the pandemic first hit are now eager to partner up. Global deal volume hit $1.43 trillion in the quarter, up from about $1 trillion in the third quarter of 2020, according to Dealogic. Bond offerings and equity offerings have slowed but remain higher than normal.</p><p>More deals are on the way: Bank executives said their pipelines for potential future deals remain full, an indicator corporate chieftains are feeling confident. Still, Mr. Solomon said that the lightning-fast deal pace wasn't sustainable. \"There will be some speed bumps along the way,\" he said.</p><p>Third-quarter trading revenue was more of a mixed bag. It fell 5% at JPMorgan and Citigroup. It jumped 23% at Goldman, to $5.61 billion.</p><p>Bond trading came back to earth after a supercharged 2020, when nervous companies raced to raise debt. Now, investors are trying to determine the new normal of trading activity. Bond-trading revenue was flat at Goldman and down at the other big banks.</p><p>Executives across the banking industry struck a confident tone on the economy, saying that the impacts of the pandemic and world-wide supply-chain are ebbing. But those same issues have roiled the stock market, and the banks have taken advantage of the volatility. Almost all of them recorded double-digit increases in stock-trading revenue. Goldman's stock-trading revenue surged 51%.</p><p>For all its Wall Street prowess, Goldman is trying to expand on Main Street. Revenue in the consumer and wealth-management division rose 35% to $2.02 billion, or about 15% of the firm's third-quarter revenue. The unit includes Goldman's Marcus consumer bank and the team serving wealthy clients.</p><p>The bank recently announced plans to buy specialty lender GreenSky Inc., which arranges loans for big one-time purchases like renovation projects. Loans in Goldman's credit card unit doubled.</p><p>Overall, Goldman reported profit of $5.38 billion, or $14.93 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected $10.14 a share. Revenue was $13.61 billion. Analysts had expected $11.72 billion.</p><p>Compensation expense rose 2% to $3.17 billion. Total operating expenses were $6.59 billion, up 6% from the same period last year.</p><p>The bank's return on equity, a measure of how profitably it uses shareholders' money, was 22.5% on an annualized basis.</p><p>Goldman shares rose 3.8% Friday, or $14.87, to $406.07. They are up 54% for the year.</p><p>Write to Orla McCaffrey at orla.mccaffrey@wsj.com</p><p>Goldman Sachs Profit Rises on Deal Bonanza</p>",
