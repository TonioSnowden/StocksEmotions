  "text": "<p>In the midst of the financial crisis <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d34955d2-bcc8-11e8-94b2-17176fbf93f5\">Wang Qishan</a>, then a Chinese vice-premier, expressed his disappointment to Hank Paulson, his longtime friend and US counterpart on bilateral financial and economic issues. </p> <p>The two had known each other since the late 1990s when Paulson, while still at Goldman Sachs, advised Wang and other senior Chinese leaders on a series of initial public offerings by big state-owned enterprises and banks. But as documented in the former US Treasury secretary's memoir, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43061898-e445-11e4-9039-00144feab7de\"><em>Dealing with China</em></a>, a decade later, Wang watched in disbelief as Wall Street dragged the global economy into the abyss.</p> <p>“You were my teacher, but look at your system, Hank,” Wang said as the likes of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch failed or were snapped up on the cheap by rivals. “We aren't sure we should be learning from you any more.”</p> <p>Wang, who has since risen to become China's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d34955d2-bcc8-11e8-94b2-17176fbf93f5\">vice-president</a>, and his Chinese Communist party colleagues have since learned a lot about managing corporate collapses of their own. Over recent years the party has presided over the restructurings of domestic giants such as conglomerate <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2c08fbc-2ee1-4a4b-9a6e-35a1f62c9bb5\">HNA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ea66e44-5275-11e7-a1f2-db19572361bb\">Anbang Insurance</a>. Now it is turning its attention to an even bigger challenge — the so far slow-motion collapse of real estate developer Evergrande. Like Paulson and his colleagues at the US Federal Reserve, which feared the moral hazard consequences of rescuing Lehman Brothers, the party does not want to create a precedent by bailing out Evergrande.</p> <p>Unlike them, the party has many more levers at its disposal to ensure Evergrande fades away slowly, thus reducing the shockwaves from its collapse. These include party control of the media, the central bank and Evergrande's state-bank creditors, who are owed about one-third of its $300bn in liabilities. If Wang had only known in 2008 what he knows now, this is what he might have taught his teacher about the art of restructurings, Chinese Communist party-style:</p> <p><em>Never surprise the market. Bore it instead.</em></p> <p>Evergrande in effect admitted it would default on its debts on December 3, missed bond payments on December 7 and was declared to be in “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d6b1f79-52b3-49e5-aa8a-7068adec7a9d\">restricted default</a>” by Fitch Ratings on December 9.</p> <p>The markets largely yawned, mainly because they had been warned this moment was highly likely as early as mid-August, when China's central bank hauled in Evergrande management for a high-profile scolding. Between then and last week's fait accompli, Evergrande also made a series of last-minute bond repayments that merely delayed the inevitable, but gave the market more time to abandon illusions that Beijing might rescue Evergrande. Investor sentiment toward other indebted developers was badly affected but not much else. </p> <p><em>All politics is local, so pay off the people who protest outside City Hall first.</em></p> <p>Local authorities across China used September, October and November to secure Evergrande's bank accounts in their jurisdictions and make sure they were reserved to finish ongoing developments — many of which were funded by advance payments from homebuyers — as well as contractors, some of whom protested at the developer's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e099e0e3-4fba-45a4-92e2-08891c2f8b0e\">Shenzhen headquarters</a> in mid-September.</p> <p>They also sat down in September to work out settlements with retail investors who had bought high-yield Evergrande investment products — months before international investors finally got serious about forming creditor committees and attempting to engage Chinese officials.</p> <p><em>Don't just blame the chief executive. Make him disappear from public sight and reserve the right to arrest him.</em></p> <p>The People's Bank of China reiterated its criticism of Hui Ka Yan for Evergrande's woes again in October and early December. Apart from brief reports about Hui exhorting employees to soldier on and reassuring everyone that all would be well, Evergrande's founding chair has been invisible over recent months. It is otherwise known as the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fe0559f-de6d-490e-b312-abba0181da1f\">Jack Ma treatment</a>.</p> <p>There are worse fates. As HNA's restructuring was wrapped up earlier this year, the conglomerate's top two executives — Chen Feng and Adam Tan — were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2db83780-962e-4774-82a1-f7ee3949a2b8\">arrested</a>. Meanwhile Ma, whose flagship ecommerce and online finance groups have been at the centre of a regulatory frenzy over the past year, is still far from the public spotlight but once again can enjoy lavish <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9c0b4ab-b4db-443f-8b39-e9198421d373\">overseas holidays</a>. If Hui is lucky he will similarly fade away into a luxurious, low-profile irrelevance.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tom.mitchell@ft.com\"><em>tom.mitchell@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Tom Mitchell 2021 'Insights from China on the art of restructurings' FT.com 15 December.
