  "title": "Tech Stocks Rise; Nasdaq Climbs More Than 1%; Netflix shares rise after the streaming service said it lost fewer subscribers last quarter than expected",
  "text": "<p>Technology, communications and consumer discretionary stocks led the rally as investors sought out riskier areas of the market. For much of the year, rising interest rate have weighed on the value of stocks that are more focused on growth rather than near-term cash flows. Some of that pressure has eased over the past month.</p><p>\"We have a far less volatile 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, inflation expectations have come down, and earnings season, so far, has been better-than-feared,\" said Art Hogan, Chief Market Strategist at B. Riley FBR Inc. \"Technology and consumer services have been some of the most beaten-down segments of the market. Now risk appetite is coming into those areas.\"</p><p>Stocks have swung in recent days, buffeted by an earnings season that has been scrutinized for signs about how the highest inflation in more than four decades and slowing economic growth are affecting companies. Recent results from companies such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup came in above Wall Street's expectations, even though both banks reported substantial declines in profit.</p><p>\"Earnings have been supportive of the narrative that growth isn't falling off a cliff,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. \"It doesn't necessarily look like a recession is coming. But companies have been cautious with their guidance.\"</p><p>Shares of Netflix rose 6.4% and are up 13% this week, on pace for their best weekly performance since July 2020. The streaming service said late Tuesday that it lost fewer subscribers last quarter than it had expected and forecast it would add 1 million net new subscribers in the current quarter.</p><p>Media agency house Omnicom rose 3.2% after it posted revenue that beat analysts' expectations and raised its guidance.</p><p>Retailer Bath &amp; Body Works dropped 3.7% after it issued a profit warning, pointing to inflationary pressure.</p><p>Oil services firm Baker Hughes fell 11% after its chief executive said he sees demand deteriorating over the next 18 months. Insurer Elevance Health slid 6.5% after posting lower quarterly profit.</p><p>Healthcare firm Abbott Laboratories slid 3%. It reported earnings that beat estimates and raised its guidance but also said its nutrition sales were hit by a recall and manufacturing shutdown of some infant formula products.</p><p>Results from Tesla are expected after markets close. Analysts expect the shutdown of its Shanghai assembly plant to lead to the first sequential decline in quarterly profit in over a year. Investors are also keen to see if any revisions to CEO Elon Musk's forecast for over 1.5 million vehicles to be produced in 2022.</p><p>Sentiment on Wall Street remains at historically pessimistic levels. Some investors see this earnings season as a potential turning point for this year's market rout.</p><p>\"Market sentiment is worse today than it was early in the pandemic; even 2008 pales in comparison to the bearishness right now,\" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt, an Atlanta-based money manager. \"This earnings season could be the catalyst for that to start to change.\"</p><p>Mr. Buchanan says his firm has cash to deploy across their strategies, particularly in global equities. \"Once we see the last flush lower or confirmation of a breakout, we are ready to get aggressive,\" said Mr. Buchanan.</p><p>Elsewhere, sales of previously owned homes fell for their fifth straight month in June, as rising home prices and higher interest rates continued to weigh on buyer demand. The median sales prices of an existing home notched another record high in June, rising 13.4% from the previous year to $416,000. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 5.51% in the week ended Thursday, up from 2.88% from a year earlier, according to housing-finance agency Freddie Mac.</p><p>Bond markets reflected a more pessimistic view. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 2.956% from 3.017% on Tuesday. Yields fall when prices rise. The yield on shorter-dated bonds remained higher, with the 2-year yield at 3.181%. This is known as an inverted yield curve and is a popular recession predictor.</p><p>Oil prices ticked down. Brent, the global benchmark for crude, declined 1.6% to $105.69 a barrel, reversing direction after three consecutive days of gains.</p><p>\"Energy prices reflect the wider sentiment in the market. What's creating this volatility are higher chances of a recession,\" said Antonio Cavarero, head of investments at Generali Insurance Asset Management.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 slipped less than 0.1%. Uniper, a German utility, gained 13%. Russia's President Vladimir Putin said the Nord Stream pipeline will resume gas flows after its maintenance period ends Thursday.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks rose. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.1%. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 2.7%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Eric Wallerstein at eric.wallerstein@wsj.com</p><p>Tech Stocks Rise; Nasdaq Climbs More Than 1%</p>",
