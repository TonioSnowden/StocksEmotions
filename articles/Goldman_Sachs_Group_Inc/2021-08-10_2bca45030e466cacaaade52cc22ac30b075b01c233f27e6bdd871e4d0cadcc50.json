  "text": "<p>There is only one place to start: The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a11b08c-4fb3-49ec-8939-9d853745bfce\">latest IPCC report</a>, which makes clear the world really is running short of time to stop climate change. </p> <p>Warning after warning has been issued. But human-made greenhouse gas emissions — most from burning oil, gas and coal — keep rising. The damage is now pretty much baked in, with a 1.5C increase in temperature above pre-industrial levels now likely by 2040, even with deep and rapid cuts in emissions.</p> <p>As the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc07027c-7bb3-4472-8ff4-16113f75041e\">editorial</a> argues, none of the report's conclusions should be surprising to anyone who has been watching. But it should be alarming and a solution will require weaning us from our “carbon addiction”. The report also sets up a pivotal few months of climate diplomacy ahead of the UN climate conference in Glasgow; as well as the forthcoming debates in US Congress about the $3.5tn budget bill, including climate provisions, the Senate Democrats have <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/HEN21B52.pdf\">proposed</a>. </p> <p>Welcome to another Energy Source. Our first note today is an op-ed about the oil industry's cognitive dissonance on climate change. Readers, do please weigh in with your thoughts, gloomy or otherwise.</p> <p>Our second note and Data Drill both reflect on the past quarter — and what we learnt from the US shale patch's earnings season.</p> <p>Thanks for reading. And thanks to all the Calgarians who've been in touch. I'm still in the city for another week doing some more reporting. Please get contact me at <a href=\"mailto:derek.brower@ft.com\">derek.brower@ft.com</a>!</p> <h1>Climate change and the oil industry's cognitive dissonance</h1> <p>Oil supermajors from BP to Total to ExxonMobil all now talk of addressing the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change. </p> <p>These are grand sentiments that companies hope will reassure investors that they can “green” their operations and devise strategies to keep churning out profits despite the threats of climate change.&#xa0;</p> <p>But the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a11b08c-4fb3-49ec-8939-9d853745bfce\">latest report</a> from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows that tinkering round the edges will not be enough. The fossil fuels used to heat, power and move people and goods around are responsible for the vast majority of man-made carbon emissions.</p> <p>The problem is burning the stuff, not how it is produced. Progressive oil companies' focus on so-called scope 1 and scope 2 emissions — essentially, their carbon pollution from getting the fossil fuels out of the ground and to the market — is welcome. But those emissions are dwarfed by the harm caused when their products are combusted.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land,” the IPCC report finds. </p> </blockquote> <p>The current concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the highest in at least 800,000 years — and the burning of fossil fuels is the main culprit.</p> <p>Carbon emissions from fossil fuels have grown almost uninterrupted since the industrial era.&#xa0;Over the past decade fossil fuel combustion was responsible for 86 per cent of the CO2 pumped into the atmosphere by humanity.&#xa0;</p> <p>Emissions of methane — a far more potent greenhouse gas — have also accelerated markedly in the past decade, especially in the past six years, driven by oil, gas and coal extraction, as well as agriculture. This is despite pledges by several countries to eliminate methane pollution. </p> <p>Less than a year ago, in fact, many American oil companies were pleased that Donald Trump's government was making it easier for them to pump more methane into the atmosphere (though most big names now support a clampdown).</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/f8c2a0a9-b32f-4b9c-83da-4d70534d1584\">Carbon-capture projects</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/839f9cf4-a4b6-4c4c-83f8-6141d77404a0\">hydrogen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/19f042c4-d08e-49cb-a43a-516e19d4cda5\">biofuels</a> and other technologies might help curb emissions, if they can be adopted at scale. But the timeline for their adoption remains lengthy, despite years of talk about the potential.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Too often, the oil industry still acts like the threat from climate change is existential to everyone except itself.&#xa0;</p> <p>The IPCC is clear. If we keep burning fossil fuels in the manner we do now, huge problems await. The latest devastation caused by forest fires in North America and south-eastern Europe, and floods from China to Germany offer a glimpse of this future of increasingly extreme weather.&#xa0;</p> <p>And yet, as analysts at S&amp;P Global Platts points out, consumers' immediate response has been to increase fossil use, not reduce it: heatwaves are driving unprecedented demand for air conditioning, pushing up fossil fuel power generation. </p> <blockquote>  <p>“High temperatures across the world have resulted in unprecedented cooling demand, driving greater thermal generation,” said Chris Midgley, its global director of analytics. “Droughts are impacting crops and hydroelectricity stocks while in other regions floods impact production.”</p> </blockquote> <p>The priority of many oil companies remains to produce their fossil fuels more cheaply, not to cut back on production. Investors will reward greener, cheaper oil production. But, as the International Energy Agency argued earlier this year, this will not matter in the long run. </p> <p>The implication of the IPCC's report — to be confirmed by the forthcoming UN climate summit in Glasgow — is that burning fossil fuels is incompatible with efforts to stop climate change, however green the production.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>UN secretary-general António Guterres put it in starker terms, <a href=\"https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/secretary-generals-statement-the-ipcc-working-group-1-report-the-physical-science-basis-of-the-sixth-assessment\">saying yesterday</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>This report must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels, before they destroy our planet.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>(Derek Brower and Myles McCormick)</em></p> <h1>Three things we learnt from the earnings season</h1> <h2>1. Little Oil is starting to look more like Big Oil</h2> <p>After a quarter of elevated crude and natural gas prices, and low spending, America's shale producers found themselves awash in cash. </p> <p>But there was no great rush to fire up the drilling rigs. Rather, producers are sending the influx of cash back to shareholders, largely through new dividend schemes. </p> <p>With the new focus on dividends, the shale sector's pitch to investors is sounding a lot more like their Big Oil rivals compared to a few years ago when they argued growth would set them apart.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“It's truly a movement within our sector of getting more cash back to shareholders. And I think that's a good thing,” Rick Muncrief, Devon Energy's chief executive, told analysts on the company's earnings call. </p> </blockquote> <p>Muncrief's company is paying a variable dividend, which can rise and fall along with commodity prices.</p> <p>Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, the largest producer in the Permian Basin, summed up his company's transformation: “We used to spend every dollar to drill a well . . . now the free cash flow, essentially, all — most of it all — goes back to the shareholder base.”</p> <p>Those companies that established or lifted their dividend payments were “the clear winners” of the quarter, said analysts at Credit Suisse. The glaring exception was EOG Resources, a shale powerhouse that has been slower to embrace dividend payouts. The lack of a dividend from the company “stood out in a week of positive surprises,” the bank said.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs said EOG could “benefit from a more clear framework around cash returns given the company's strong balance sheet”.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/38646b01-28f1-4ace-81c6-f8cee958f99a.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <h2>2. Discipline holds: fuel for the oil bulls</h2> <p>All the talk of dividends and funnelling cash back to shareholders is fodder for oil's bulls, who argue that a more restrained shale supply will mean higher crude prices. </p> <p>“Colour us pleasantly surprised, companies largely avoided the allure of talking about growth in 2022,” said analysts at the Houston investment bank Tudor Pickering, Holt &amp; Co. “Management teams continue to walk the walk on capital discipline”.</p> <p>They added that “the recent surge in Covid cases, baseline spare capacity within Opec, and the desire to focus on shareholder returns,” were all keeping a lid on shale growth.</p> <p>Operators will be under more pressure to unveil their 2022 plans in the coming weeks, but judging from this earnings season spending is in check and growth estimates for next year are likely to start coming down.</p> <h2>3. Is this as good as it gets for shale? </h2> <p>Shale is ticking a lot of boxes for shareholders: discipline is holding, direct cash returns are up, oil prices are holding, natural gas prices are at multiyear highs and the sector is consolidating around larger players. </p> <p>Yet shares are hardly going gangbusters. Over the past six months — a period of strong returns and $65-75 oil — the XOP, an index of US oil and gas producers, has still underperformed the broader S&amp;P.</p> <p>Powerful headwinds remain, with an energy transition to cleaner fuels the most obvious. On this front, there was not much new from oil companies after a flurry of announcements over the past year. Renewed worries about Covid-19 and the Delta variant's impact on fuel demand — which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba4ab9a0-4e89-4979-b794-c7e5593724a6\">hit oil prices</a> in recent days — plus uncertainty about when Opec+ will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b517d13d-dc7b-4610-b468-7ded0b46d8f7\">restore all its oil</a> to the market are hanging over the sector. After years of poor returns and shale failures, a distrust of management lingers among investors <em>(Justin Jacobs)</em></p> <h1>Data Drill</h1> <p>Shale earnings in the past quarter were healthy thanks to a stronger oil price. And Chapter 11 bankruptcy filings for oil producers in the first two quarters were at the lowest levels since 2015, according to a <a href=\"https://www.haynesboone.com/-/media/project/haynesboone/haynesboone/pdfs/energy_bankruptcy_reports/oil_patch_bankruptcy_monitor.pdf?rev=61c2606a5be547598c8d716d1a795c39&amp;hash=97ECA4B149560404B19497FA37CB2B50\">new report</a> from Haynes Boone, a Texas law firm.&#xa0;</p> <p>The oilfield services and midstream segments of the industry are faring better too. Thirteen oilfield companies filed for bankruptcy so far in 2021, compared with 17 in the same period of 2020. Only three midstream companies have filed for bankruptcy this year and none in the second quarter.&#xa0;</p> <p>Shale groups were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2ec8421-6ee4-4d59-8052-4580a3337bc2\">hit hard</a> by the pandemic's price crash last year. In the oilfield services sector alone, more than 60 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d8203bcd-c5b5-40a7-943c-c230115d6931\">companies</a> filed for bankruptcy in 2020, leaving behind about $45bn in total debt. <em>(Amanda Chu)</em></p> <h1>Power Points</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Go to the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/climate-capital\">Climate Capital</a> hub for our pieces on the IPCC's latest report. </p></li>  <li><p>Don't miss this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe4e658e-0473-4f98-b995-4606aefa90bc\">Big Read</a> on the challenge of linking individual natural disasters to climate change.</p></li>  <li><p>The co-leader of the Green Party weighs in on what Germany needs to do right now to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9dfed41-5b63-443f-a51e-fa56c15f9c80\">curb climate change</a>. </p></li>  <li><p>To decarbonise the oil sector, Cenovus chief Alex Pourbaix&#xa0;argues <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f9e5c5ec-f4bc-4565-a1cd-903117547f5e\">Justin Trudeau must pay</a>.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Insurance markets are having a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ca98920f-8c27-4762-9ff7-16d317325fc8?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=7c8f09b9-9b61-4fbb-9430-9208a9e233c8#myft:notification:daily-email:content\">hard time</a> getting everyone to support climate targets.</p></li>  <li><p>The Dixie Fire is now the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/08/dixie-fire-california/?utm_source=ActiveCampaign&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=Climate+news%3A&amp;utm_campaign=TDC+Daily\">second-largest</a> in California's history.
