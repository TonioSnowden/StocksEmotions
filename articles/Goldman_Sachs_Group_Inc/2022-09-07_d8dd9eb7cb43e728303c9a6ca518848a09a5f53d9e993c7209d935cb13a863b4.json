  "text": "<p>I'm back from a month-long break, and my thanks go to Sophia Smith and Janina Conboye for keeping our inboxes supplied with great Working It newsletters. But it's such fun to be at work again. I am anticipating another packed season of workplace trends, ideas and debates about what the next “hot” viral TikTok trend will be. (I see you, quiet quitting.)</p> <p>While I was off, I was messaged on Instagram by someone asking me about crying at work. “It's not something that happens regularly, but in the past month, it's happened twice. Is it OK? How should managers react? How do you get past the embarrassment?”</p> <p>Not to bring the mood down, but these are all great questions, and as someone prone to crying during hard conversations at work, they stuck with me all the way back to the office. A wise colleague once gave me the tip to simply plough on with what you are saying, totally ignoring the fact that you are weeping. In her male-dominated environment, this tactic worked perfectly well. Nobody ever mentioned it. </p> <p>Please help me — and your fellow Working It readers — by sharing your own thoughts and experiences in the comments below on intense emotional reactions at work, whether you are the person crying — or the listening colleague or manager. We'll cover it on the podcast soon. </p> <p>Read on for Sophia's investigation into the oft missing piece of parental leave policies: what happens once it's over. <em>(Isabel Berwick)</em></p> <h1>Give new parents a ‘second onboarding' after returning from parental leave</h1> <p>After Clara Hogan had her first baby, she returned to work from maternity leave only to be told that her department was being given fewer resources, which made an already difficult transition even more stressful. Now Clara has a new job at PR firm LaunchSquad, and returned to work in mid-August after five and a half months off with her second baby. The amount of support she received made “a world of difference,” from her first experience, she said.</p> <p>The overwhelming focus of parental leave policies is the number of paid weeks off that employees receive. But having benefits and best practices in place for employees' return to work is important for easing the transition in what can already be a stressful period of life change.</p> <p>When Clara first arrived back at LaunchSquad, she received an email with a list of people who'd left the company, people who'd joined, and everyone who'd been promoted, along with a list of other big updates, putting everything she missed in one place. Brett Weiner, a LaunchSquad partner who helps lead internal operations, says that they see the return from parental leave as a sort of “second onboarding”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Abby Hollingsworth, the vice-president of global benefits at Salesforce, also compared the return from parental leave to the experience of being a new hire. When someone on her team returns after having a baby, they get paired with a “buddy” who offers peer support and fills them in on what they've missed. She's actively discussing this buddy system with the company's employee resource groups to explore how it might be better formalised.</p> <p>Salesforce offers a wide range of support for new parents returning to work, including breastmilk shipping service Milk Stork, which makes it possible to go on a business trip when you have a nursing infant at home.</p> <p>Abby went on maternity leave from Salesforce herself five years ago. She admits that colleagues questioned her about taking the full six months off. (She did it anyway.) But she returned to a supportive boss. Looking back at that time, Abby says that she wished she had shown herself more compassion. “I thought I could do everything the exact same way after having a baby. I didn't give myself the chance to think about how my world could change.” By modelling good work-life balance themselves, Abby believes that leaders enable their employees to do the same.</p> <p>As she ramps back up at LaunchSquad, Clara is starting off with fewer clients. “Everyone has reiterated that they expect me to take my time getting back into the swing of things,” she <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/clara-hogan-40748335_remotework-maternityleave-activity-6965415821900738560-dFk8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop\">wrote</a> on LinkedIn. LaunchSquad told her not only to block off time on her calendar for pumping as needed, but to let the human resources team know if those times weren't being respected. Private follow-ups to see how she's doing have helped her feel supported. “Companies have put a lot of thought into expanding their leave policies,” she says. It's time to start having more conversations about what happens after the leave, too. <em>(Sophia Smith)</em></p> <p><em><strong>Are you a working parent?

We recorded this just before a summer of flight delays and cancellations amid a climate crisis and record-breaking temperatures. It seems more topical than ever to ask whether there can be any justification for flying to a conference or business meeting that could happen virtually. I talk to guests Evan Konwiser of American Express Global Business Travel and FT columnist and associate editor Pilita Clark.</p> <p>Next week, we focus on the fast-growing world of microdosing for work, in a bid to boost creativity and focus. You'll hear the Working It team visit a pop-up shroom cafe in London for some coffee and treats. These (non-psychedelic) mushrooms are a type of nootropic, which is any supplement that yields brain-boosting effects. And I talk to Jakobien Van Der Weijden, co-founder of the Microdosing Institute in the Netherlands, about why that practice is gaining in popularity. <em>(Isabel Berwick) </em></p> <h1>Elsewhere in the world of work: </h1> <ol>  <li><p><strong>Why the office-home balance is still a challenge: </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bfc90a1-4162-487f-93da-f92763f91b6c\">How to make hybrid arrangements work</a> is still the management question of the moment.

Last week Higgins published <em>Bully Market</em>, a riveting memoir chronicling <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48642326-6185-4bee-a2b3-0c3d792999ec\">the sexism, discrimination, and harassment she faced</a> in finance. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Lessons from one of Japan's great industrialists: </strong>Known in Japan as the “God of management”, Kyocera and KDDI founder Kazuo Inamori died last month at 90.

FT readers shared their thoughts on misguided approaches to sifting through job applicants in the interview process.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf046ccf-a695-4677-8f09-7378da542794?commentID=9c359fdd-56f2-49f8-9eeb-b84918034040\">Kplk</a> once saw a fellow interviewer purposefully set up an unpleasant situation for candidates giving presentations on an overhead projector:</p> <blockquote>  <p>The chair of the committee replaced the projector bulb with a dud, saying that ‘we would identify who was well prepared and able to cope with stress'. Only one candidate knew how to switch the bulb, and smoothly gave their presentation. When l made the point to her about coping so well, she answered, ‘well l work for a **** company where nothing works, so I'm used to broken equipment and being stress-tested by game-playing stupid senior management'. ‘Oh dear, not the right sort at all' said the chair afterwards. They successfully avoided hiring a clever, competent, honest and quick-thinking young woman who wouldn't have fit in at all.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf046ccf-a695-4677-8f09-7378da542794?commentID=628fa2bd-3211-418f-8373-4c3e319d2324\">Chris May</a> explains why they view these types of interview “gotchas” are red flags:</p> <blockquote>  <p>If the company is going to put you in such a pressured position often enough that it's a main skill, you probably don't want to work there. Just leave the room. Making people defensive and nervous in an interview is useless and counterproductive. The purpose is to find out what they know, not what they don't.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf046ccf-a695-4677-8f09-7378da542794?commentID=b31a197f-0763-4f64-a608-c7366eff7c8b\">James Peach</a> puts these common interview-style questions in context, compared to how we actually work, and offers a suggestion for how interviews could be improved:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Interview questioning (<em>e.g. </em>quickfire, brain teaser, testing intuition) does not reflect the slow, analytical, reflective sort of thinking most modern jobs require. That's why I think questions or at least topics should be shared with candidates in advance. Because in a real job you are given time to do work.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>Responses have been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p>Source: Isabel Berwick and Sophia Smith 2022 'This key part of parental leave gets overlooked' FT.com 7 September.
