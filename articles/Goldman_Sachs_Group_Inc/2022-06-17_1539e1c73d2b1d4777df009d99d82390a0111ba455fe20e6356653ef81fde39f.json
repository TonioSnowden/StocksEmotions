  "title": "World News: Chinese Graduates Face an Even-Tighter Job Market",
  "text": "<p>\"After each job interview, I felt nothing but frustration,\" said Mr. Wang, a 22-year-old philosophy major. After several months of trying, Mr. Wang now says he would gladly settle for a job that pays 5,000 yuan a month, the equivalent of less than $9,000 a year. That is less even than the city's average per capita disposable income last year of about $10,000.</p><p>In May, youth unemployment rose to 18.4%, according to government data released on Wednesday, from 13.8% a year ago. The May rate is the highest recorded for youth since 2018, when Chinese officials began releasing the data.</p><p>The outlook is expected to worsen among this group, even as the overall jobless rate in urban China edged down to 5.9% in May from April's 6.1%. A record 10.7 million university graduates will swarm the labor market this year, likely sending the youth jobless rate to 23% in July and August, economists at BofA Securities Inc. estimated in a report.</p><p>Rising stress in the labor market reflects both short-term shocks from Beijing's strict zero-Covid policy as well as the residual impact from policy makers' clampdown on the property, internet and education sectors. Those are three of the most-coveted industries for China's young elites in a country where only about 4% of the population had an undergraduate or higher degree in 2019.</p><p>While officials have introduced relief measures to help graduates find jobs, economists say such small-scale efforts can only do so much.</p><p>As it can anywhere, rising joblessness, if persistent, could ripple across the economy and stir discontent and even unrest. That fear is especially salient during a sensitive year in which leader Xi Jinping is expected to break with recent precedent and secure a third term in power when the Communist Party leadership convenes, likely in the fall.</p><p>\"For a country that's always been so fixated on social stability, that is very problematic,\" said Stephen Roach, an economist and lecturer at Yale University.</p><p>Among graduates looking for jobs, less than half had received offers as of mid-April, the most recent period for which data was available, down from 63% a year ago, according to a survey by recruitment platform Zhaopin Ltd.</p><p>For those able to have signed contracts, the average monthly salary dropped by 12% from a year ago, to the equivalent of less than $12,000 a year, the survey showed.</p><p>Competition has intensified. In the first quarter of this year, each fresh graduate was chasing, on average, 0.71 job vacancy -- the bleakest outlook by this measure since Zhaopin began recording such data four years ago.</p><p>Making clean comparisons is a challenge with China, whose official unemployment figures exclude hundreds of millions of migrant workers.</p><p>China's official measure of youth unemployment stands out among large economies, topping the European Union's 13.9% and the U.S.'s 7.8% youth jobless rates. In contrast to the improving jobs picture for young people in Europe and the U.S., the problem is worsening quickly in China.</p><p>Houze Song, a fellow at the Paulson Institute, a Chicago-based think tank, estimates that China's overall unemployment rate is actually likely in the double-digit percentages, taking into account April's sharp contractions in industrial output and retail sales.</p><p>China needs gross domestic product growth of at least 5% this year to achieve its 5.5% unemployment target, according to Goldman Sachs economists. The World Bank last week lowered China's GDP growth forecast to 4.3% this year. Several investment banks have projected growth below 4%.</p><p>Li Ya, a 28-year-old graduate student in film production living in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has gone through 17 job interviews, including with many tech companies and universities since September, but is still empty-handed. Fewer companies visited his university to recruit fresh graduates this year, Mr. Li said.</p><p>\"Finding a job turns out to be much harder than studying,\" he said.</p>",
