  "text": "<p>Big U.S. banks are among the first to report earnings, with updates due from Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and Citigroup before the opening bell. The sector is expected to be a weak spot after banks booked bumper profits during the pandemic. Analysts expect first-quarter earnings for S&amp;P 500 banks to fall 37% from a year ago, according to FactSet.</p><p>Corporate results will also be scrutinized for guidance on how companies expect to manage tighter policy from the Federal Reserve, with a series of interest-rate increases expected.</p><p>\"Investors are trying to figure out if the Fed is on the right course. Can they stick the landing in terms of bringing inflation down without bringing the economy down?\" said David Donabedian, chief investment officer at CIBC Private Wealth.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined to 2.675% from 2.688% on Wednesday. While declining in recent days, the yield on the benchmark note earlier this week hit its highest level since January 2019 as investors gear up for rising interest rates. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Retail sales figures for March and weekly jobless claims are due at 8:30 a.m. ET. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index is due at 10 a.m.</p><p>In commodity markets, Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, fell 0.9% to $107.81 a barrel. Gold prices declined 0.4%.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 inched up 0.1% as gains for travel stocks balanced losses for telecommunication firms. Sweden's Ericsson dropped more than 8% after reporting earnings that missed expectations in part because it suspended its operations in Russia.</p><p>The latest policy decision from the European Central Bank is due Thursday. The ECB, which hasn't followed the Fed and other major central banks in raising rates, is seen as unlikely to make any major changes to its monetary policy.</p><p>In Asia, stock markets were mostly higher. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.7% and the Shanghai Composite Index gained 1.2%.</p><p>Write to Will Horner at william.horner@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Waver Ahead of Bank Earnings</p>",
