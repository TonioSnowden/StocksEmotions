  "title": "Heard on the Street:  Unraveling Archegos Fund Shows Risks of Investment Banking  ----  By Rochelle Toplensky",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Last year, investment banks made bumper profits. This year some unexpected bills are turning up. </p><p>\n  On Monday, Credit Suisse and Nomura said they would both incur substantial losses from the collapse of an unnamed U.S. client, thought to be former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang's hedge fund Archegos. Nomura estimated its exposure at roughly $2 billion, while Credit Suisse said it was \"premature to quantify\" the hit. Shares in both banks plummeted by more than 10%. </p><p>\n  The sale of big blocks of shares late last week by many banks -- including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank -- hinted at a hedge-fund collapse. Investors should brace for a wider fallout as it is unclear if all of Archegos's positions have yet been unwound. Shares in a handful of other lenders with potential links to the fund were slightly down in morning trading. </p><p>\n  The losses come just weeks after many global banks announced full-year results boosted by billions of dollars in earnings from investment banks capitalizing on last year's market volatility. The news is a reminder that there is lingering risk associated with those outsize gains. As the 2008 financial crisis made clear, costs in banking can come long after profits are booked and celebrated. </p><p>\n  Credit Suisse is still digesting the collapse earlier this month of Greensill, a British supply-chain finance company that declared bankruptcy shortly after the Swiss bank froze funds that provided it with liquidity. The double hit could be an extraordinary run of bad luck; there were other banks caught up in both failures. Alternatively, it could point to endemic problems of risk management at Credit Suisse. The Swiss company carried on working with Greensill despite internal concerns. </p><p>\n  Shareholders understand that investment banking is a high-risk, high-reward business. The irony is that Credit Suisse didn't have as rewarding a 2020 as many of its peers due to the cost of previous lapses. Bumper trading profit in the final quarter was swamped by two one-off charges: $850 million in legal costs related to toxic securities sales before the 2008 crisis and a $450 million write-down of its stake in hedge-fund York Capital Management, bought in 2010. </p><p>\n  It has been a tough first year for new Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein. The Credit Suisse veteran was appointed February 2020 to steady the ship after Tidjane Thiam was ousted over a spying scandal. It hasn't been anything like the clean start the lender was hoping for. </p><p>\n  Regulators have forced banks to hold much more capital over the past decade, which has been one reason for their low returns on equity. In the jargon, Credit Suisse has a 12.9% common-equity Tier 1 ratio of high-quality equity to risk-weighted assets, which should be more than enough to absorb the latest losses. The Archegos drama is a reminder, if any were needed, of why those return-sapping buffers are required. </p><p></p>",
