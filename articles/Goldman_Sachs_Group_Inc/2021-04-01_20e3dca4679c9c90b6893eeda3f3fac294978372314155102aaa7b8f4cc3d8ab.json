  "title": "Julie Mehretu's soothing abstractions at the Whitney",
  "text": "<p>The pandemic divided New York into two different cities: vibrant neighbourhoods that residents rarely leave, and formerly chic touristy areas that have gone dormant. The Whitney Museum is squarely in the slumber zone, amid a muted High Line and shopping streets that have the eerie vacancy of a de Chirico cityscape. That unnatural tranquility is surely a blow to the museum's finances, but it also proves the perfect frame for Julie Mehretu's dense yet airy paintings. They have never looked better than in this buoyant mid-career retrospective, their tangles, ribbons, colours and layers sharpened by the breathing space all around. Her work is anything but escapist — she tackles destruction, war, displacement and revolution — and yet there's something soothing about her gentle abstractions. Effervescence transcends darkness.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mehretu's mural-sized canvases are decorative in the best sense of the word, spinning natural forms into meditations on complex social themes. The show tracks her evolution, the subtle shifts in sensibility and technique that have gradually accumulated into radical change. What once struck me as tepid gimmickry acquires complexity and depth. The panoramic quality of a retrospective helps. When she's immersed in a particular phase, her explorations tend to shade off from exciting to repetitive. For a while, she produced a lot of fragmented urban grids, with streetscapes and floor plans sprinkled with abstract shapes and calligraphic slashes — works that built her not just a reputation but a brand. Goldman Sachs commissioned a $5m mural for the lobby of its Manhattan skyscraper. Her painting “Black Ground (Deep Light)” fetched $5.6m at Sotheby's Hong Kong in 2019. But the Whitney traces a richer arc, from early student drawings scored with tiny glyphs to more recent effusions of colour, violence and spray-painted drama.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Map Paint (white)”, from 1996, resembles a satellite photo of a sparsely populated area, with dense clusters linked by rivers and roads. Move in closer, and the geographical features shatter into discrete symbols: parades of insects, swarming eyes, platoons of breasts, arrows, sperms, beaks and mouths. But all those tiny runes only draw attention to the deserts of blank canvas, waiting vainly to be inhabited or inscribed. Soon she added topographic elements, migrating her tiny creatures across mountain ranges and plains. Lines coil, sweep and shoot across the surface as in force vector diagrams, suggesting masses on the move.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mehretu hit on her mature style a few years later, when she started scaling her work up to mural size, aiming for the grandeur of traditional history paintings. Her first cycle opens with “Retopistics: A Renegade Excavation” (2001), a monumental rendering of a gyrating landscape. Mehretu says it contains “a staircase ascending here, another descending into tops of a tent city there; it's all drawn diminutively, from multiple perspectives and aerial views, with super-super-tiny clusters of civilisations, worlds and cities inside this infrastructure of this other meta-space.”&#xa0;</p> <p>I'll take her word for it: those separate pockets of settlement tend to vaporise into interlaced vortices and lucent swirls. Other works from the same series implode, their energy sucked centripetally into black pinholes, or burst, hurling matter out to the edges of the frame. Everything is always in motion, recapitulating the migrations of millions propelled by disaster, poverty and war.</p> <p>Mehretu has spent much of her own life in transit. Born in Addis Ababa in 1970 to an American mother and an Ethiopian father, she and her family moved to East Lansing, Michigan, in 1977 to escape political turmoil in Ethiopia. Rhode Island, Berlin and New York have all been waystations on her journey. A 2007 residency at the American Academy in Berlin led to “Berliner Plätze”, in which she lowers her viewpoint from the skies to the street. In black-and-white ink and acrylic, she resurrects a vanished cityscape as a tight weave of slender lines. The facades of long-demolished buildings rear up, only to dissolve into shadows of ruins. Masonry melts into memory; stolid apartment blocks fade into ghostly piles.</p> <p>The painting of a city that was razed and rebuilt emerged out of Mehretu's disgust with the Iraq war and her increasing sense of culpability and horror. Surrounded by the scars of total combat, she erected a Berlin as it might still appear if Europe hadn't lost its mind. She hints at this narrative but carefully erases it. Copious research on geography, history and architecture crumbles into delicate traceries of abstraction, forming a palimpsest that both explores and obscures. Hers is a dream city: from afar, it dissipates into haze; up close, details cohere but never quite resolve.</p> <p>For decades, black artists who leaned toward abstraction felt pressured to address social issues, but Mehretu manages to have it both ways, wrapping political content in pure, joyous form. She takes on the Arab Spring, Hurricane Sandy, the decay of western civilisation, the architectonics of capitalism and so on, but those references would be hard to divine if she didn't tell us to look for them. Mostly, we see teeming, allusive gestures that intersect and intertwine. That strategy has a long history in western art. Kandinsky hid his apocalyptic visions of a New Jerusalem beneath expressive flights of colour. Pollock would begin a painting with totemic symbols, then bury them in febrile brushstrokes. In Mehretu's hands, the technique tempers indignation with nuance, or fortifies complexity with outrage.&#xa0;</p> <p>She began her powerful 2016 canvas, “Conjured Parts (eye), Ferguson,” with a photograph from the protests that followed the police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri: a man with his arms in the air faces a riot squad. It would take an archaeologist's eye to find that source image, though, since she altered it, then submerged it beneath waves of screen-printed, sprayed and brushed-on pigment. The result is calculated confusion. Her precise draughtsmanship has given way to blur, just as the chronological account of a crucial few seconds sometimes spin off days of chaos. Tear gas, fire and twilit confusion bleed through the smoky violet surface and muted tones of green and orange. “Bodies appear inside the painting and outside the painting, disembodied and disregarded,” Mehretu has said. The picture becomes a metaphor for simple brutality that hides under layers of lies and justifications.&#xa0;</p> <p><em>To August 8, </em><a href=\"https://whitney.org/\"><em>whitney.org</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Ariella Budick 2021 'Julie Mehretu's soothing abstractions at the Whitney' FT.com 1 April.
