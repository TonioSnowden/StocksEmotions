London's FTSE 100, Germany's Dax and France's Cac 40 all increased about 1 per cent. Futures tracking the US S&amp;P 500 index added 0.9 per cent after the US benchmark fell 2.3 per cent on Friday.</p> <p>There was less optimism in Asia where a broad gauge of markets in the region ended the first trading session of the week down about 1 per cent. Japan's Topix fell 1.8 per cent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng and South Korea's Kospi each fell about 0.9 per cent.</p> <p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, however, rose 4 per cent to $75.59 a barrel, having lost more than 10 per cent on Friday in its largest fall since April 2020.</p> <p>The yield on the US benchmark 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to its price, gained 0.05 percentage points to about 1.54 per cent after falling the most since March 2020 on Friday.</p> <p>But uncertainty surrounds the new variant that was first discovered in southern Africa earlier this month.</p> <p>The World Health Organization said yesterday Omicron's impact was not yet known and added there was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dcc05c7a-1d27-44e3-a050-9078134792d0#post-ff5063fb-1686-4a8c-9cc5-98e6f216e377\">“substantial uncertainty”</a> regarding its ability to transmit and potential to pierce through natural and vaccine immunity. On Friday it labelled Omicron a “variant of concern”.</p> <p>Analysts at Moody's Analytics said it would be “at least two more weeks before more will be known as scientists around the world build a better understanding of the new variant and as the severity of infections becomes clearer”.</p> <p><em>Are you changing travel or work plans because of the new strain?
