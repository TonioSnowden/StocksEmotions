Last year's M&amp;A boom and a growing number of blockbuster property transactions in Florida have pushed up lawyers' rates and driven a fierce battle for staff as rates routinely eclipse $1,000 an hour.</p> <p>“We have anywhere from five to eight times as many [vacant] positions as qualified candidates,” said Miami-based recruiter <strong>Joe Ankus</strong>. “We're getting called 10 times a month by law firms and corporations asking if we have anyone. We've resorted to telling them we don't have any more purple unicorns today.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Lawyers with expertise in real estate and Wall Street experience are particularly in demand, as financiers such as<strong> Citadel's Ken Griffin</strong>, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a25dc71-d26f-43b0-87cb-9bff3b9746c9\">declared</a> Miami a “growing metropolis that embodies the American dream”, plant their flags on the low-tax dealmaking paradise.</p> <p>Miami mayor <strong>Francis Suarez </strong>has been keen to keep that dream alive, offering tax credits, low-interest-rate loans and other economic incentives that have lured in new residents including<strong> Blackstone</strong>, <strong>Elliott Management</strong>, <strong>Icahn Enterprises</strong> and<strong> Goldman Sachs</strong>.</p> <p>The frantic phone calls dangling juicy pay packages in exchange for a move to Florida couldn't come at a better time for lawyers that cut their teeth on Wall Street.</p> <p>The recent slowdown in IPOs, blank-cheque deals and megamergers suddenly has left many of them with little to do, and their golden handcuffs are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50baba43-f182-40b1-8ae7-0cb8fbaa2f0c\">looking less secure</a>.</p> <p>If ballooning salaries aren't enough to tempt lawyers down south, the lifestyle just might.</p> <p>“Lawyers are realising it's a great climate . . . and are thinking: I just sold my house in New York for $3.8mn and I can buy a nice house for $1.6mn, why didn't I do this sooner?” said Ankus.</p> <p>It's also a safe bet for corporate lawyers looking to stay close to the action.</p> <p>Suarez's glittering new Miami boasts all the comforts of home for Manhattan's ultra-wealthy set — <a href=\"https://www.timeout.com/miami/news/nycs-raos-is-opening-in-miamigood-luck-getting-in-081122\">down to the same restaurants</a> — without the cold weather or <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22c9b76b-ea36-4c8c-8cae-1bbb104098d2\">pesky tax hikes</a>.</p> <h1>M&amp;G's identity crisis</h1> <p>Fund manager <strong>M&amp;G</strong> has been a City of London stalwart since the 1970s.&#xa0;</p> <p>But the imminent departure of chief executive <strong>John Foley </strong>and the recent arrival of a new chair with a background in dealmaking has dredged up an old debate among investors:<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b624eaa8-1caf-4ca9-9fad-17827779281a\"> is it time for a break-up?</a></p> <p>It has been three years since the company's relaunch as an independent business following its demerger from UK insurer <strong>Prudential</strong>. Critics have argued that its unwieldy structure — a £150bn asset management business attached to a near £200bn retail and savings division — is grounds for another split.</p> <p>But when rival <strong>Schroders</strong> began exploring a bid for M&amp;G last year, it ended up backing out of what would have created a £1tn asset management powerhouse due to concerns about culture.</p> <p>Under Foley, described by one investor in M&amp;G as “a shrewd operator, a bit quirky and unconventional”, several former staff members recalled stories of stress, sexual harassment and a laddish, heavy drinking culture.</p> <p>Changes at the top, including Foley's retirement and the arrivals of <strong>Kathryn McLeland</strong> as finance chief from<strong> Barclays </strong>in January and former M&amp;A lawyer<strong> Edward Braham</strong> as chair in March, have convinced some investors that M&amp;G is ready to break with its troubled past.</p> <p>Cultural shifts aside, shareholders are torn on how to separate M&amp;G's clunky structure. Its heritage annuities business could be a useful source of<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73aafec4-4362-11ea-a43a-c4b328d9061c\"> permanent capital</a> — a red-hot asset class attracting giants <strong>Apollo</strong> and <strong>Blackstone</strong>. Others insist that trying to run with private equity titans is a losing game. </p> <p>M&amp;G will need to identify its strengths before going through with another major overhaul.</p> <h1>One of Europe's longest-running banking chiefs bids adieu</h1> <p>As Russia's invasion of Ukraine gathered steam,<strong> Société Générale</strong>'s chief<strong> Frédéric Oudéa</strong>'s appeal to keep running the bank's Russian subsidiary <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ecb4bccf-5cb2-49a7-ba36-61354ad8ad72\">was making headway</a> behind closed doors.</p> <p>At a meeting in early March with French president <strong>Emmanuel Macron</strong> and finance minister <strong>Bruno Le Maire</strong>, Oudéa and several other company bosses were told there was no pressure to leave the country in a rush, two people with knowledge of the discussions said. </p> <p>Little did Oudéa know that the more he doubled down on SocGen's <strong>Rosbank </strong>subsidiary, the more he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/112cbe12-ca97-45d3-a100-220d401f35e2\">sealed his fate</a> as the Parisian lender's former boss.</p> <p>The Frenchman had been pushing back on proposals to shut down SocGen's Russian subsidiary as early as 2020.</p> <p>However, his attempts to salvage Rosbank backfired after the war forced SocGen to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21b64f70-e71e-47d7-bf24-ad90dfa6a854\">take a €3.1bn hit</a> following the sale of its Russian assets. </p> <p>After a decade and a half of poor performance blamed on difficult markets, SocGen's board had a multibillion-dollar loss to pin squarely on Oudéa's shoulders.</p> <p><br>SocGen's shares have plummeted 71 per cent since Oudéa took the helm in 2008, and its valuation is among the worst of any major European lender.</p> <p>Still, he managed to keep his head on by charting small wins, like the successful launch of SocGen's online retail bank <strong>Boursorama</strong>, and the lender's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ea188dd-0d51-4c71-a56e-8ab4d25891fa\">€4.9bn acquisition</a> of car leasing business <strong>LeasePlan</strong>.</p> <p>The most scathing criticisms levelled at Oudéa during his tenure pertained mostly to poor performance. But the invasion of Ukraine has made it difficult for Oudéa's past failures to fly under the radar.</p> <p>The stakes are high for his successor, as SocGen continues to trade at a “distressed valuation” in a time of extreme economic uncertainty. </p> <p>Promising internal candidates include former <strong>Rothschild </strong>banker<strong> Sébastien Proto</strong>, who runs SocGen's domestic retail bank, and <strong>Slawomir Krupa</strong>, who runs SocGen's investment bank.</p> <p>Several bankers told the FT that <strong>Jacques Ripoll</strong> — a former employee who recently left a job running <strong>Crédit Agricole</strong>'s investment bank — could be a potential contender too, despite recently joining French energy group <strong>Eren</strong>. <strong>Laurent Mignon</strong>, the head of domestic rival BPCE, has also been raised as a contender.</p> <p>Going with a fresher face might be wise, given the challenge ahead. “The board needs to find somebody younger who can give a new direction to the bank,” said a former SocGen executive who is close to Oudéa.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Citigroup</strong>'s <strong>James Fleming</strong> is now the sole head of its banking, capital markets and advisory business in the UK and Ireland, <a href=\"https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/citi-jan-skarbek-exit-james-fleming-deals-promoted-20220815\">per Financial News</a>. The move follows the departure of Fleming's co-head <strong>Jan Skarbek</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Barclays </strong>has hired <strong>Roy Kabla</strong>, a senior banker in <strong>Houlihan Lokey</strong>'s tech, media and telecoms business, as head of its media and entertainment unit in New York.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>White &amp; Case</strong> has hired two partners from<strong> Paul Hastings</strong>:<strong> David Viklund</strong>, who joins the firm's global M&amp;A practice in New York, and <strong>Ted Smith</strong>, who joins its real estate industry group in Houston.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Ungodly returns</strong> A Vatican-backed impact firm promised to connect celebrities and deep-pocketed investors to the world's most pressing issues, from climate change and poverty to refugee crises.
