  "text": "<p>Stocks on Wall Street rallied for a second consecutive day, as focus shifted from Reddit's day traders to negotiations between Joe Biden's administration and Republican lawmakers over a proposed $1.9tn US stimulus package.</p> <p>The blue-chip S&amp;P 500 rose 1.4 per cent, with more than four-fifths of the companies in the index advancing. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 1.6 per cent, ahead of earnings results from Amazon and Alphabet, Google's parent company.</p> <p>Mr Biden met a group of 10 mostly moderate Republicans on Monday after they <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6446012-5bba-4ff7-ab41-8ceef3487485\">proposed</a> an alternative economic relief package worth $618bn, three times smaller than the plan wanted by Democrats. </p> <p>Analysts are keeping a close eye on the size of the fiscal injection, which could provide a jolt to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/us-economy\">US economy</a> and put cash directly in consumers' hands. </p> <p>The gains on Wall Street were led by shares of banks including Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs and industrials goods businesses including John Deere and Caterpillar.</p> <p>Small-cap stocks, expected to be benefit acutely from additional stimulus, continued an advance this year that has far outpaced the benchmark S&amp;P 500. The Russell 2000 climbed 1.2 per cent on Tuesday, lifting its gains for the year to just under 9 per cent.</p> <p>“I think that a larger stimulus package would generate a positive response,” said&#xa0;Teresa Jacobsen, managing director at UBS Private Wealth Management, who added that a combination of the relief package and vaccine rollouts would allow the US economy to “bounce back this year”. </p> <p>In Europe, the continent-wide Stoxx 600 index closed up 1.3 per cent, while London's FTSE 100 benchmark rose 0.8 per cent and Frankfurt's Xetra Dax gained 1.6 per cent.</p> <p>On Tuesday some of the recent Reddit-fuelled rallies began petering out. Silver futures, which soared as much as 11 per cent on Monday, settled 10 per cent lower at $26.40 a troy ounce. The rush into the metal began late last week after a user on Reddit suggested buying silver to put a “squeeze” on banks.</p> <p>GameStop, the stock at the centre of the battle between Redditors and Wall Street, slid 60 per cent on Tuesday to $90 a share, it's biggest one-day decline since it became a publicly traded company.</p> <p>Some users of the Reddit community r/WallStreetBets expressed nervousness at GameStop's price fall, with one commenting: “I'm worried. Tell me not to.” But others pushed back against those wavering in their positions. “Don't be a pussy, hold,” wrote one user.</p> <p>Other heavily shorted stock also retreated. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond tumbled 16 per cent to about $25.38, having hit $53.90 last week. </p> <p>The Vix — an index that tracks expected volatility in US equities — fell back to 25.73, about 12 points below its high during last week's frenetic trading.</p> <p>The more upbeat mood led to a modest sell-off in haven assets such as core government debt. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which has risen this year on the prospect that more stimulus will feed through to higher inflation, climbed 0.02 percentage points to 1.10 per cent.</p> <p>Oil neared a 12-month high “buoyed by optimism over vaccine rollouts”, said Callum Macpherson, head of commodities at Investec. Brent crude, the global benchmark, climbed 2 per cent to settle at $57.46 a barrel — its highest level since late February last year.</p> <p>In Asia, China's benchmark CSI 300 index jumped 1.5 per cent, with most sectors including healthcare and industrials moving higher. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.2 per cent and South Korea's Kospi 200 advanced 1.3 per cent.<br><br></p><p>Source: Leke Oso Alabi and Alice Kantor in London and Eric Platt in New York 2021 'US stocks advance as Reddit trades show signs of unwinding' FT.com 2 February.
