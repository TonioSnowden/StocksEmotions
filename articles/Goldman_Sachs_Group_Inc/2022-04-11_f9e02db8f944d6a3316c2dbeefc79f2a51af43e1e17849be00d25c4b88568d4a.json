The two will face off in an April 24 rematch of the 2017 election.</p><p>Ms. Le Pen has dialed down her criticism of the eurozone but her advance in the polls still sent jitters through European markets in recent weeks.

The yield on 10-year French government bonds rose to 1.280% from 1.257% Friday.</p><p>Stocks in China tumbled as the economic toll of Covid-19 lockdowns in Shanghai and supply-chain disruptions in the country continued to mount.

The war in Ukraine, which is entering a new phase in the east of the country, has boosted commodity prices, adding to inflationary pressures.</p><p>Investors will parse results from some of the biggest financial institutions when first-quarter earnings season kicks off this week.
