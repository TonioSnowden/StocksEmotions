  "text": "<p>LONDON—Former U.K. Treasury chief Rishi Sunak—who lost this summer's Tory leadership contest to Liz Truss after saying her tax and spending plans were too risky—is leading the field to succeed her as the Conservative Party prepares to choose its fourth new leader in three years.</p><p>Mr. Sunak, a former hedge-fund manager who as chancellor of the exchequer tried to narrow Britain's budget gap by raising taxes, has a sizable support base among his fellow members of Parliament. His spokeswoman declined to comment.</p><p>Other competitors include cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt, who finished third in the summer race to be prime minister. She was fastest out of the blocks on Thursday. \"This is make or break time,\" said her \"Penny Mordaunt for PM\" website.</p><p>A wild card in the race, political analysts said, could be Boris Johnson, if he decides to throw his hat in the ring. Mr. Johnson resigned as prime minister in August following a series of scandals and is currently holidaying in the Caribbean. His spokesman declined to comment.</p><p>British oddsmakers give Mr. Sunak a 58% chance of winning the race, followed by Ms. Mordaunt at 33% and Mr. Johnson at 12%.</p><p>In the wake of Ms. Truss's ouster Thursday, Tory leaders set out a new, speedier process to choose the next prime minister and said a winner would be determined by the end of next week. To be a candidate, a lawmaker needs to be nominated by at least 100 of the 357 Conservative MPs.</p><p>If more than one person tops that threshold by a Monday deadline, the party's 170,000 members would cast online votes to decide the victor.</p><p>The accelerated selection process triggered frenetic plotting as Conservative lawmakers tried to position themselves behind a winning candidate. But the party is cleaved along several ideological fault lines, making it difficult to see an obvious unity candidate.</p><p>\"The Conservatives have an existential choice facing them: Do they want to try another exciting experiment or do they want to go for a leader who is comforting and confidence inspiring,\" said Tony Travers, a politics professor at the London School of Economics.</p><p>Ms. Truss, with a libertarian agenda, won support from Tory members looking to juice the economy as their party trailed in the polls, Mr. Travers said. Now, with the economy headed toward recession and inflation hitting 10.1%, credibility with markets may be more crucial.</p><p>The Conservative Party is trailing far behind the opposition Labour Party in polls. Labour had the backing of 52% of people polled by survey firm Survation. The Conservatives had 23%.</p><p>That makes it unlikely that the Conservatives will trigger a general election until at least 2024.</p><p>For now, all eyes will be on Mr. Johnson, a popular but controversial figure in the party. Around 50 members of his own government quit during the summer in an effort to force him to leave Downing Street following a series of scandals.</p><p>Some of those scandals still hover, including a continuing parliamentary inquiry into whether Mr. Johnson lied to lawmakers after he claimed there were no parties in Downing Street during lockdown. He denies any wrongdoing.</p><p>But some see Mr. Johnson as the only candidate who can unite the different wings of the party. More than half a dozen lawmakers came out publicly on Thursday to back Mr. Johnson taking over. </p><p>A sale of posters for rival Conservative Party leadership candidates looking to succeed Prime Minister Boris Johnson in August.

Mr. Sunak's resignation as Treasury chief this summer triggered the end of Mr. Johnson's tenure in Downing Street. Mr. Sunak was criticized for betraying Mr. Johnson by Conservative members.</p><p>As Ms. Truss's government floundered, Mr. Sunak stayed out of the public eye. The 42-year-old, who backed Brexit, is seen by his supporters in the Conservative Party as an earnest pragmatist who can steer the country through spiraling inflation and looming stagflation.</p><p>Mr. Sunak's problem, critics say, is that he is too rich to appeal to working-class voters, especially since he likely would have to push through tough public spending cuts to appease investors nervous about the nation's finances.</p><p>Mr. Sunak's wife, Akshata Murty, is the daughter of an Indian billionaire businessman.</p><p>Ms. Murty this year had to change her tax arrangements after admitting she benefited from tax rules that allowed her to pay no U.K. tax on her worldwide income. Mr. Sunak was also lampooned in the media for turning up at a construction site over the summer wearing Prada loafers.</p><p>Mr. Sunak previously argued his rise to wealth embodies the meritocratic values of the Conservative Party. His grandparents immigrated in the 1960s and are originally from India. His mother ran a pharmacy in southern England and his father was a doctor.</p><p>Mr. Sunak attended an elite British private school and then went on to work for Goldman Sachs. It was while working on an M.B.A. at Stanford that he met his future wife.</p><p>David Hodge, a 77-year-old retiree and member, said he wouldn't back anyone if he gets a vote. \"We clearly need a candidate who is somebody who can actually bring the party together,\" he said. \"We could be back in this situation again in months.\"</p><p>But after years of friction, several lawmakers Thursday said it was time to stop squabbling and put differences aside.</p><p>\"Whatever the outcome of this contest, every Conservative MP must accept the result and back the new prime minister,\" said Steve Baker, a Conservative lawmaker who has repeatedly rebelled against leaders in the past.</p><p>Write to Max Colchester at Max.Colchester@wsj.com</p><p>Rishi Sunak, Former U.K. Treasury Chief, Leads Race to Succeed Liz Truss as Prime Minister</p>",
