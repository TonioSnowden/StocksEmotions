  "text": "<p>Fed officials have pushed back, saying that a recession isn't baked in the cake.</p><p>Who's right? Well, so far, it's a mystery.</p><p>Don't miss: The U.S. is on track for a soft landing, Goldman Sachs chief economist says</p><p>Also read: The U.S. economy is not in recession — for now</p><p>The economy was pretty weak in the first half of this year.</p><p>At the moment, economists expect growth to pick up in the second half of the year, with Americans having spent freely on a summer of vacations, weddings and family reunions as the coronavirus pandemic, for many, in the rearview mirror.</p><p>Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at the Robinson College of Business at Georgia State University, thinks the economy might falter once the beach umbrellas get put away and kids go back to school.</p><p>\"We are going to slow. We are slowing,\" Dhawan said in an interview.</p><p>Consumers will curtail spending after splurging this summer and business travel won't pick up the slack, he said.</p><p>Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed staffer and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, sees a \"50-50 chance\" of a recession.</p><p>With inflation so high, the Fed has to slow growth and raise unemployment to fight it.</p><p>See: Inflation falls for first time in more than two years, key U.S. gauge shows</p><p>Also: U.S. gains 315,000 jobs in August. Labor market still strong but shows sign of cooling.</p><p>\"If they don't get it just right, you're going to have a recession,\" Gagnon said.</p><p>Darwin is worried the Fed will push interest rates up too high.</p><p>There is a lot of chatter about the likelihood of a \"mild\" recession, but Dhawan is worried.</p><p>Often recessions start off as mild and \"then the bottom falls out,\" he noted.</p><p>Key Words: 'Why shouldn't it be as bad as the 1970s?' Historian Niall Ferguson warns the world is sleepwalking into an era of political and economic upheaval akin to the 1970s — only worse.</p><p>Read: Economist predicts a 'whopper' of recession</p><p>Fed officials say there is an increased recession risk but that it is not their base case.</p><p>In his Jackson Hole speech last week, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the fight against inflation is likely to require a sustained period of growth below 2%.</p><p>Recessions are, by their very nature, unpredictable because they are \"random shocks,\" Gagnon said.</p><p>Models meant to predict recessions \"don't have a ton of power as far as being able to predict a recession,\" St Louis Fed President James Bullard told the Wall Street Journal earlier this month.</p><p>Wall Street economists tend to shy away from predicting recessions for self-preservation reasons.</p><p>\"On Wall Street, if you forecast a recession that doesn't come – you could lose your job,\" said Robert Brusca, chief economist at FAO Economics.</p><p>On the other hand, Wall Street can be very forgiving if a recession comes and you didn't forecast it, he added.</p><p>Key data to watch will be whether inflation is taking a bite out of corporate profits, Brusca said.</p><p>If businesses find that inflation is eating away their profits and start to lay off workers. This could lead households to curb spending.</p><p>At MarketWatch, we cover economic data so our readers know where the economy is headed so they can play their careers and look after their financial health.</p><p>We find there are \"known unknowns\" about the outlook that, once cleared up by the data, can completely change expectations for the economy. For instance, it wasn't too long ago that economists were forecasting U.S. economic growth at a 5% annual rate this year and talking about another \"roaring '20s.\"</p><p>In this periodic column, we will dig into these key mysteries facing the U.S. economy, tell you everything that is known and some of what isn't. We will try to keep track when the data confirm or change the conventional wisdom.</p><p>Read on: America has entered a housing recession, builders and brokers say</p><p>How can we tell whether the U.S. economy is heading into a recession? Or already in one?</p>",
