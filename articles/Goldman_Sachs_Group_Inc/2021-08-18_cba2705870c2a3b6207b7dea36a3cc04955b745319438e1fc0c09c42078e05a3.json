  "text": "<h2>Private capital thrives in public markets</h2> <p>Back when the likes of <strong>Stephen Schwarzman </strong>and <strong>Henry Kravis </strong>were regarded as mere masters of the universe, stock market investors used to shy away from their Wall Street empires.</p> <p>There was a lot to dislike about the shares. For starters, they weren't actually shares but partnership units — and owning them meant having to file tax returns in practically every state where <strong>Blackstone </strong>or<strong> KKR</strong> had invested in a widget maker, drilling rig or warehouse.</p> <p>On top of that, private equity tycoons made most of their money when their biggest deals paid off. That was difficult to follow, let alone model, and the resulting “carried interest” payments had an unnerving habit of drying up for years on end and then arriving all at once in great galactic blobs.</p> <p>These days, the biggest private equity firms are no longer viewed as superheroes. They're the energy and matter of the financial universe itself.</p> <p>That's one reason why the biggest US private capital companies have tripled in value since the lows seen during spring 2020's Covid-induced market sell-off. The combined market value of Blackstone, KKR, <strong>Carlyle</strong>, <strong>Apollo</strong> and<strong> Ares</strong> has ballooned from a March 2020 low of $80bn to about $252bn this year, DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Robin Wigglesworth <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d85c0a3-8f52-4b43-8fa7-36c0391562de\">report</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>It helps that buyout groups have become asset-gatherers, raising more and larger funds in private equity, credit, real estate and infrastructure. Assets under management have more than doubled in five years.</p> <p>The result is that stock market investors can spend less time worrying about erratic carried interest, which is now a smaller part of the economic picture, and instead think soothing thoughts about the hefty 2 per cent management fees that pension funds pay buyout groups to manage their money.</p> <p>It's a Copernican revolution of sorts — one that has placed private capital firmly at the centre of the financial firmament.</p> <p>Schwarzman called Blackstone's second quarter “the most consequential in our history”. Apollo's <strong>Marc Rowan</strong> said “almost every day, the business gets better”.&#xa0;</p> <p>While returns for private equity's shareholders have soared, it isn't clear whether the industry's other set of investors, the pension funds that pour cash into its investment funds, will do quite as well.&#xa0;</p> <p>They profit from the kind of leverage that former UK financial services minister <strong>Lord</strong> <strong>Paul Myners</strong> said would seem “irresponsible and reckless” if applied to their public equity portfolios. Still, a paper by <strong>Oxford university</strong> academic <strong>Ludovic Phalippou</strong> last year found returns on average were roughly equal to a cheap index fund tracking smaller stocks.&#xa0;</p> <p>Rivals to the industry say the volume of money now flowing in will inevitably erode returns further.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Private equity cannot continue to have a lot of alpha, given how it has grown,” said <strong>Sandy Rattray</strong>, chief investment officer of the hedge fund<strong> Man Group</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <h2>‘Just Merge': Just Eat Takeaway resists calls to consolidate</h2> <p>Last month, one of <strong>Just Eat Takeaway</strong>'s largest shareholders<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1df30dd9-f4d7-49f3-be97-2454fcb8fd0e\"> implored the company</a> to take action to prop up its share price or risk being targeted by a hostile bidder.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Cat Rock Capital</strong>, an activist investor that owns about 5 per cent of the Anglo-Dutch delivery group, blamed the 20 per cent drop in the group's share price this year on “broken communication”. It recommended that JET explore “strategic options”, including divestments or a merger with a larger rival, to stave off a hostile takeover.</p> <p>“We think the company could be vulnerable to a lowball bid in the near term if it does not take action,” said Cat Rock's founder and managing partner<strong> Alex Captain</strong>, listing <strong>DoorDash</strong>, <strong>Delivery Hero</strong>, China's <strong>Meituan </strong>and<strong> Amazon</strong> as potential suitors.&#xa0;</p> <p>JET's chief executive <strong>Jitse Groen </strong>told the FT's Tim Bradshaw on Tuesday that he didn't want it to combine with a company that was either heavily lossmaking or too dissimilar. Since <strong>Takeaway.com</strong> has already bought up rivals <strong>Just Eat </strong>and <strong>Grubhub</strong>, there isn't an obvious candidate for the next deal.&#xa0;</p> <p>And on the question of selling assets, Groen also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/52cff7e0-0b24-404c-8bb5-0a4ee177204f\">disagrees</a>.</p> <p>“That is a solution that we don't agree with,” he said on Tuesday. “We don't think it makes sense for a leading food delivery business to sell leading businesses.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Groen said he's happy playing the long game. “I thought it would have been a great idea to merge Just Eat, Grubhub and Takeaway.com in 2011. It took 10 years . . . you don't always decide when is the right moment for a transaction.”</p> <p>While he's protesting the idea of a deal now, Groen could always change his mind.&#xa0;</p> <p>His words haven't always lined up with his actions. Last year Groen publicly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2925554d-c2de-45dd-85c8-ab254cd3d884\">dismissed the potential</a> of JET building its own logistics network and expanding into grocery delivery — areas in which the company is now investing heavily.</p> <h2>Oatly: short sellers and short supplies</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea6afa6c-ccf5-46f9-929e-7ed6007da9f3\">Earnings forecasts</a> by the Swedish vegan milk maker <strong>Oatly</strong>, which has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df32c5ec-cc28-4ec4-b400-a9fe2af5af47\">enticed investors</a> from <strong>Blackstone</strong> to <strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong>, have struck DD as a little frothy.</p> <p>The company forecast a near two-thirds jump in annual revenues on the back of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da70e996-a70b-484d-b3e6-ea8229253fc4\">alternative dairy boom</a>, as it defended its financial reporting after recent criticism from US short seller <strong>Spruce Point</strong>.</p> <p>The New York-based hedge fund released a report in June <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210714005631/en/Spruce-Point-Capital-Management-Announces-Investment-Opinion-Releases-Report-and-Strong-Sell-Research-Opinion-on-Oatly-Group-AB-Nasdaq-OTLY\">questioning</a> the group's environmental credentials and financial accounting.&#xa0;</p> <p>Oatly's chief executive <strong>Toni Petersson</strong> called it “false and misleading”, adding that a special board committee helped by independent legal counsel and forensic accountants had reviewed and rebuked the claims.</p> <p>Regardless of whether Spruce Point's report holds any weight, there's another issue that makes Oatly's projections seem overly optimistic — its unreliable supply chain.</p> <p>The milk maker has dealt with supply shortage issues since it launched in 2018 and its existing capacity constraints have been exacerbated by the pandemic.&#xa0;</p> <p>Shortages have become so bad, Petersson acknowledged on an analyst call on Monday, that <strong>Starbucks</strong>, which has an exclusive partnership with Oatly, has had to sign up for another oat milk provider to fill the gap.</p> <p>Oatly, which raised $1.4bn when it floated on the Nasdaq in May at a $10bn valuation, could struggle to maintain its edge as the premier oat milk brand and fulfil its promises to investors without improvements.&#xa0;</p> <p>The shares have slipped more than 10 per cent since Monday and are trading below its initial public offering price of $17.&#xa0;</p> <p>Yet as it prepares to open its second plant in Asia and nearly double its product output from 2020, Petersson remained confident that the end of the Oatly drought is near.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Adam Crozier</strong>, the former <strong>ITV </strong>and <strong>Football Association </strong>chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/45779a8b-2dd0-4ee3-89a8-c00af5185266\">is to take over</a> as chair of <strong>BT </strong>at the end of the year as the UK's largest telecoms group awaits the next move by its largest shareholder, the telecoms billionaire<strong> Patrick Drahi</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Citigroup</strong> has named<strong> Dhiren Shah </strong>as chair of global technology M&amp;A.

She will remain in independent practice as a barrister at <strong>Wilberforce Chambers</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Goldman Sachs Asset Management </strong>has hired<strong> Maria Vassalou</strong> as deputy chief investment officer of its multi-asset solutions group, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-16/goldman-hires-macro-fund-manager-vassalou-at-200-billion-unit?sref=OziMsGoK\">per Bloomberg</a>.

With the help of private equity firms General Atlantic and Silver Lake, Ric Elias, the company's chief executive and co-founder, has quietly become one of the most powerful media moguls in the US.
