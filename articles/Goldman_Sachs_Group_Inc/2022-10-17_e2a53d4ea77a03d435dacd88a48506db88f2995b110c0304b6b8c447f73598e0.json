  "text": "<p>The committee \"has a strong interest in obtaining a complete accounting of federal government spending at Trump properties,\" she wrote, saying the panel is examining potential legislation to prevent presidential self-dealing.</p><p>In a statement, Mr. Trump's son Eric Trump said that \"any services rendered to the United States Secret Service or other government agencies at Trump-owned properties were at their request and were either provided at cost, heavily discounted or for free.\" He added that the company \"would have been substantially better off if hospitality services were sold to full-paying guests, however, the company did whatever it took to accommodate the agencies.\"</p><p>With November elections approaching, the House Oversight Democrats have only months left to receive a formal response while they can be guaranteed to be in charge of the panel. Republicans are favored to win the midterm elections, and if that happens, they would be in charge of the committee during the new Congress, which begins next year. In addition, Ms. Maloney lost her primary race and will exit Congress after this term.</p><p>An expanded version of this story appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Popular stories from WSJ.com:</p><p>* Goldman Plans Sweeping Reorganization</p><p>* New England Risks Winter Blackouts as Gas Supplies Tighten</p><p>* Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers Are Strugglingâ€”for the Same Reason</p><p>Trump properties charged excessive rates to government, House Democrats say</p>",
