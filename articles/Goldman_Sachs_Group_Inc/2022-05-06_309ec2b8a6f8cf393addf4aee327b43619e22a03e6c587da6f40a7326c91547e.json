  "text": "<p>They took a hit Thursday as the broader market tumbled but have held on to their lead for 2022. The iShares Core High Dividend exchange-traded fund, which tracks 75 such stocks, is up 3.9% this year. That puts the fund far ahead of the S&amp;P 500, which is down 13% in 2022.</p><p>The fund includes stocks like Exxon Mobil Corp., which has a dividend yield of 3.9%; Johnson &amp; Johnson, which has a yield of 2.6% and Coca-Cola Co. with a yield of 2.7%. All three are beating the market for the year.</p><p>What's unusual about this year's rally in dividend-paying stocks is that it is the opposite of what market convention says happens when interest rates rise. Usually, investors say, dividend-paying stocks do poorly in a rising-rate environment because rates typically go up when the economy is growing. In boom times, investors tend to forgo the steady cash payments of bondlike stocks in favor of companies that have the potential to deliver bigger profits later.</p><p>This time, a different dynamic is at play. Interest rates have risen swiftly, not because investors are betting on an economic surge but because accelerating inflation is forcing the Federal Reserve to act quickly to rein in price pressures. Some investors worry the Fed's increases could cause a recession.</p><p>That has drawn investors into shares of big dividend payers, which promise to deliver a steady stream of cash in the near term.</p><p>A bonus? Many dividend payers are in industries like utilities, telecommunications and consumer staples, which consumers tend to rely on year round, regardless of the economic environment.</p><p>That has made them especially attractive to investors who are worried the Fed won't be able to combat inflation without significantly raising unemployment.</p><p>\"I don't want high risk. I want a cereal company with a dividend that I know is coming,\" said Steve Chiavarone, senior portfolio manager and head of multiasset solutions at Federated Hermes.</p><p>Froot Loops maker Kellogg Co., which has a dividend yield of 3.3%, is up 9% this year.</p><p>Mr. Chiavarone said Federated Hermes has been recommending that clients take an overweight position in dividend-paying stocks.</p><p>It is the call in which they have the highest conviction this year, he added.</p><p>In recent weeks, analysts at Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have also issued recommendations for clients to invest in dividend-paying stocks.</p><p>The rise in dividend-paying stocks comes as nearly every other part of the market has fallen this year. For years, investors had piled into shares of fast-growing companies, wagering the premium they paid for them would be justified by their better-than-average earnings.</p><p>That was especially true in an environment where interest rates had fallen to historic lows, making bonds look less attractive.</p><p>Investors have largely shied away from growth stocks this year. The S&amp;P 500 technology sector is down 19%. The communication-services sector, which includes technology-driven companies like Netflix Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc., is down 24%.</p><p>\"Part of the popularity of the high-dividend players has been the 'nowhere to hide' narrative in the markets this year,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corp.</p><p>Another reason dividend-paying stocks are doing so well?</p><p>It has nothing to do with the dividends themselves. Many dividend payers are energy companies, whose shares have jumped this year as crude prices have taken off.</p><p>Oil-and-gas companies, for instance, make up around 7.4% of the Vanguard High Dividend ETF, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer and founding partner at Cresset Capital. That has been a boost to the fund in a year where the S&amp;P 500 energy sector has risen 45%.</p><p>After a good run, some investors who had put money in dividend-paying stocks say they are now looking for bargains elsewhere.</p><p>The market reversal has gone so far that Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors, said the firm is no longer looking to shift more money into the bet.</p>",
