  "title": "Goldman Sachs considers London IPO for Petershill Partners business",
  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs plans to list its <strong>Petershill Partners</strong> unit in a deal that could value the Wall Street bank's alternative assets business at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fcfccca2-e806-4093-93da-0c952bb7d741\">more than $5bn</a>.</p> <p>Petershill, which owns minority stakes in 19 alternatives firms with a combined $187bn of assets under management, said it plans an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange. </p> <p>If it goes ahead, the IPO plans to raise $750m by issuing new ordinary shares, and separately will also sell existing ordinary shares to achieve a free float of 25 per cent, the company said. </p> <p>Ali Raissi, co-head of the Petershill group, said in a statement that “this IPO would be a natural next step in the evolution of the offering to partner firms, establishing a permanent capital source, and demonstrating long-term strategic alignment and partnership”.</p> <p>In its 14-year history Petershill has raised and deployed $8.5bn of capital across a broad range of strategies including private equity, private credit, private real assets and absolute return. Petershill's holdings include Caxton Associates, one of the world's oldest and best-known hedge funds, Ross Turner's Pelham Capital and technology buyout firm Accel-KKR. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Dechra Pharmaceuticals</strong>, the veterinarian drugmaker, said trading has remained strong after posting a 21 per cent jump in annual core earnings. The company reported an underlying operating profit for the year ended June of £162.2m on revenue up 21 per cent to £608m. Dechra has continued to outperform a robust market throughout the pandemic with the momentum and market penetration seen in the second half of the prior financial year continuing, the company said.</p> <p><strong>Powerhouse Energy</strong>, which extracts hydrogen from waste plastic, said German chemicals group Linde has finalised a technical feasibility study to deploy the company's technology and is in talks with Powerhouse licensee Hydrogen Utopia International to develop a plant in Poland.</p> <p>Insurer <strong>Randall &amp; Quilter</strong> posted a $23.5m first-half operating loss, which it said reflected “the episodic earnings profile” associated with legacy contracts. The company said it expected to book $23m of underwriting profit in the second half. Fee income in the period more than doubled to $50m.</p> <p><strong>Totally</strong>, the healthcare services provider, said recent trading has been in line with market expectations. “Recently published data by NHS England on waiting lists and new service opportunities to support the management of long Covid present further opportunities for organic growth across the business,” it said.</p> <p>Build-to-rent accommodation group <strong>Watkin Jones</strong> said it was on track to complete all projects scheduled for the 2021 financial year having since mid-May handed over 857 apartments. The company said its development pipeline beyond 2021 now comprises around 3,870 apartments and 6,750 purpose-built student accommodation beds with a total estimated future development value of £1.7bn.</p> <p>Investment group <strong>Digital 9 Infrastructure</strong> said it had bought a data centre in Iceland, operating on a former Nato site near Keflavik, for approximately £231m in cash.</p> <p><strong>KPMG</strong>'s global boss <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ec3a7cc6-c968-47e9-8c55-4505d805068c\">waded into a row</a> with the UK's Financial Reporting Council over the poor quality of the firm's banking audits, placing renewed pressure on the accounting firm's relations with the industry regulator. Bill Thomas, KPMG's global chair and chief executive, wrote to the FRC this summer after executives at the Big Four firm grew alarmed at a threat by the regulator to publish a letter admonishing its UK arm for persistent shortcomings, people briefed on the matter told the FT.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>A frantic summer of <strong>global dealmaking</strong> has put 2021 on track to break records, with&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b955a75-55a4-4e13-b785-638b88bbfb0b\">almost $4tn of deals</a>&#xa0;already agreed since the start of the year, as companies rush to exploit cheap financing and bumper profits.</p> <p>Investors are pouring money in to <strong>emerging market funds</strong> that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/daa7a70c-23fb-467a-b245-f57bd47f6954\">steer clear of China</a> in the wake of Beijing's crackdown on targeted stocks and sectors. The assets of five prominent EM ex-China exchange traded funds surged 41 per cent to $1.5bn during August, taking their year-to-date growth to 442 per cent, having ended 2020 with just $277m between them.</p> <p><strong>The United Arab Emirates</strong> has&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d68ff456-b8eb-4724-8494-a84dd32b95fb\">launched 50 economic initiatives</a>&#xa0;aimed at making the country more competitive as it seeks to diversify its oil-dependent economy, including a drive to attract $150bn in overseas investment within nine years.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson <br></strong>Conditions are ripe for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/636aef63-6b42-4d7b-9fd3-374289e4ec13\">a rethink of compensation norms</a>. Directors need to ask whether they can justify the potential payouts to all of their stakeholders. And if boards truly believe that equity ownership is vital for focusing executives on shareholder value creation, then they should extend that logic to other employees.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Guthrie</strong> <br>It is time for airlines to be far more realistic about their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7482babb-2fb6-4c50-8307-4ea259489fcb\">emissions offset programmes</a>, which are pricing carbon at big discounts to what industrial companies pay to cover excess emissions. Airlines need to disclose clearly the assumptions behind their online calculators.&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Goldman Sachs considers London IPO for Petershill Partners&#xa0;business' FT.com 6 September.
