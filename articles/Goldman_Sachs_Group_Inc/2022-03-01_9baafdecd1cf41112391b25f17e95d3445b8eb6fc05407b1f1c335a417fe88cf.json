  "text": "<p>Archegos Capital Management and global banks are in negotiations to avoid a protracted courtroom battle that would expose details of the deals that led to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c480d5c0-ccf7-41de-8f56-03686a4556b6\">unravelling of the family office</a>, according to three people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>The potential legal battle centres on billions of dollars of swaps contracts agreed between banks such as Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse and the family office run by former hedge fund manager Bill Hwang, which spectacularly imploded last March.</p> <p>The talks to agree a truce come as financial watchdogs and the Department of Justice in the US have expanded a wide-ranging probe into apparent irregularities in Wall Street's lucrative practice of marketing large blocks of shares.</p> <p>Authorities are examining whether banks broke rules when they negotiated the “block trades” — the private sale of large quantities of shares to hedge fund clients — including during the failure of Archegos last year.</p> <p>Morgan Stanley, which was heavily exposed to Archegos and was among the first to put large blocks of shares it held on behalf of the investor up for sale, disclosed last week that the Securities and Exchange Commission had been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d14c8bf-d6fd-4cb0-b654-9dfdc4254bc1\">examining the bank's block trading</a> business since 2019 and that the Department of Justice recently launched its own investigation.</p> <p>Six banks that provided services through their prime brokerage or trading divisions to Archegos — Credit Suisse, Nomura, Morgan Stanley, UBS, MUFG and Mizuho — lost around $10bn when they liquidated the family office's positions in US-listed companies such as ViacomCBS after Archegos failed to meet margin calls. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which was a prime broker to Archegos but has said it incurred no material losses from the collapse, sold roughly $19bn in big block trades in one day. The banks had purchased and held those shares themselves as part of swap trades they executed for Archegos.</p> <p>A number of the banks have threatened legal action against Archegos to recoup some of the money they lost on its soured bets last March.</p> <p>However, Archegos has warned the banks that it would reject their claims, which could result in a lengthy and public legal process, according to one of the people.</p> <p>Archegos has also said it could mount its own legal claim that the banks behaved unlawfully in their dealings with it, the person said. It would claim that the banks were “negligent” when they allowed the family office to build up vast amounts of leverage and that prime brokers “induced it” into borrowing as much as $50bn of shares, they added.</p> <p>“By the time a judge has [ruled on the matter] it's five years later and the whole thing has been raked through publicly in the courts,” the person said.</p> <p>The delicate situation has prompted negotiations to resolve the proposed claims out of court. Discussions are nearing a crucial moment as an injunction that prevents Archegos's creditors from forcing it into bankruptcy to try to collect what they are owed expires at the end of March.</p> <p>“The settlement negotiations basically come down to ‘we have no money but if we find some we will pay you',” said one of the people involved in the discussions. They added that it was unlikely any of the banks would attempt to force the involuntary bankruptcy of the family office. “There is no point in doing so. Assets are being recovered and contracts unwound and proceeds distributed as appropriate,” the person added.</p> <p>But a second person close to the matter said there was “simply not enough money to cover the banks' shortfalls” and added they believed there was only a “50/50 chance” that the settlement negotiations would succeed.</p> <p>A person close to Archegos said it had not been contacted by authorities investigating the banks' block trades. The Department of Justice is separately examining the meltdown of the family office, and the Securities and Exchange Commission launched a preliminary investigation into Hwang last March. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley, Nomura, UBS, Credit Suisse, MUFG, Mizuho, and Archegos declined to comment.</p><p>Source: Tabby Kinder in London and Eric Platt in New York 2022 'Archegos and banks in settlement talks amid block trades probe' FT.com 1 March.
