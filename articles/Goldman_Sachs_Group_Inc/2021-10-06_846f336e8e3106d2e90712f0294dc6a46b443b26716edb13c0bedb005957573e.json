  "text": "<p>Cathie Wood's Ark Investment will shift its corporate headquarters to St Petersburg, Florida, from New York City, joining a growing number of Wall Street firms that are moving south. </p> <p>The asset manager will permanently close its New York office at the end of the month, and plans to start construction on a new headquarters, the Ark Innovation Center, during the first quarter of 2022. </p> <p>Florida has become known as “Wall Street South” in the wake of the pandemic, with many financiers shifting their work from home offices to the southern state, which does not levy a personal state income tax. </p> <p>This week, Goldman Sachs moved some of its asset management employees to West Palm Beach and Ken Griffin said Citadel has plans to open a large outpost in Miami*, and would be moving a significant&#xa0;number of people to those offices. </p> <p>Wood founded Ark in 2014 as an active manager in exchange traded funds owning technology companies at the forefront of disruption and innovation. Her concentrated bets on companies such as Tesla and her impressive record since 2016 has elevated Ark into the ranks of the top 10 US ETF managers. </p> <p>“Ark is not a traditional Wall Street asset management firm, and we are looking forward to breaking the mould further by relocating to&#xa0;St Petersburg, a city investing in technology, science and innovation,” Wood said in a statement.</p> <p>Ark said “a substantial number of employees have chosen to relocate and work in the office”. They will also retain their hybrid back-to-work model so some employees can work remotely. </p> <p>The asset manager said the shift to Florida would allow it to “retain and attract top talent by supporting entrepreneurs and tech start-ups” in the region. </p> <p>Ark's Innovation Center is scheduled to open in&#xa0;July 2023&#xa0;and will be located on 2.5 acres donated by the&#xa0;city of St Petersburg. Pinellas County&#xa0;will build and own the commercial property. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Madison Darbyshire </em></p> <p>*<em>This story has been amended since original publication to state that Citadel is planning to open a Miami office.</em></p><p>Source: Michael Mackenzie in New York 2021 'Cathie Wood's Ark Investment to relocate to Florida' FT.com 6 October.
