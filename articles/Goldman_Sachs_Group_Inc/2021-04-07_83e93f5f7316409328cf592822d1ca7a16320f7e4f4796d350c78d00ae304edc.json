  "title": "American Dream Default Fuels Nightmare --- Developer nears loss of mall holdings after stopping payments on New Jersey complex",
  "text": "<p>That default enables Triple Five's lenders to seize their collateral: 49% of the revenue generated by the developer's Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., and West Edmonton Mall in Canada, two of the largest and more successful malls in North America.</p><p>Kurt Hagen, senior vice president of development at Triple Five, acknowledged the likelihood of his firm losing that income stream when he spoke to the Bloomington City Council in March. It \"hasn't happened yet but it's likely to happen,\" he said.</p><p>Triple Five Group pledged the 49% interest in Mall of America and West Edmonton Mall to secure a $1.67 billion construction loan.</p><p>JPMorgan Chase Bank and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., two of the lenders in the construction loan, declined to comment.</p><p>The 3-million-square-foot American Dream complex in New Jersey opened in October 2019 and it went all in on entertainment and sports attractions to appeal to shoppers who were used to buying many products online.</p><p>It featured a 1,000-foot-long indoor ski slope, a water park and a roller coaster. The owners planned to open a giant indoor wave pool in March 2020 but closed the complex that month under pandemic restrictions, reopening in October. Triple Five struggled to collect rents while the $5.7 billion project was closed.</p><p>Mr. Hagen noted that the lenders would be able to collect rent revenue but wouldn't be able to seize the property. He added that the transfer of revenue wouldn't have any impact on Mall of America's operations and that Triple Five retains the majority 51% interest.</p><p>In many cases, commercial mortgages are backed by full ownership of the related property, rather than just the revenue. But during the pandemic, some lenders opted to extend or restructure loans in place of foreclosure, especially in cases where they feel that the borrower remains the best operator of the property. Malls in particular are more complicated to operate compared with other types of commercial real estate.</p><p>Mr. Hagen said the collateral arrangement reflected the fact the two banks preferred to have the cash flow than be stuck owning an equity share in the giant complexes.</p><p>Even without having to operate these properties, lenders aren't keen on owning malls. Rent revenue has been tumbling as more retailers divert resources to their e-commerce strategies, often giving them more leverage in negotiations with landlords.</p><p>\"The lenders would have a noncontrolling interest and quite frankly they have no interest in running a shopping mall,\" said Mr. Hagen.</p><p>Officials from the city of Bloomington said they would closely monitor the ownership of Mall of America. Triple Five said it had not qualified for any state or federal aid and had requested financial aid from the city, but these requests had been denied.</p><p>\"Over the past year, we have worked closely with our lending partners to chart a path through these difficult times,\" said a Mall of America spokesman. \"This path has positioned the company for long-term success and growth.\"</p>",
