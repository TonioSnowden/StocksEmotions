  "title": "Business News:  Lanvin Slips on NYSE Debut  ---  Trading comes after  luxury fashion retailer  merged with SPAC  backed by Chinese firm  ----  By Jing Yang",
  "text": "<p>   Chinese-owned luxury fashion company Lanvin Group surged before tumbling in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, after merging with a blank-check firm backed by Chinese private-equity firm Primavera Capital. </p><p>   Lanvin Group, which owns multiple Western brands, is controlled by China's Fosun International Ltd. and has raised over $150 million in fresh capital at a valuation of $1 billion. It came to the market despite a sharp turn in fortunes for special-purpose acquisition companies and a wider slowdown in the market for new listings. </p><p>   The shares traded above $14 in mid-morning trading before ending the day at $7.63. </p><p>   Primavera's SPAC, called Primavera Capital Acquisition Corp., raised $414 million in January 2021 at the height of the blank-check company boom. It said at the time that it wanted to merge with a global consumer company that had \"a significant China presence or a compelling China potential.\" </p><p>   SPACs are publicly listed shell companies with ready pools of cash to invest in -- and merge with -- private businesses. If a SPAC fails to find a merger target by a deadline, typically two years, investors can take their money back. SPAC shareholders also can choose to redeem their shares upon a merger. </p><p>   Lanvin Group and Primavera, founded by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Greater China chairman Fred Hu, announced the merger in March. The deal has faced multiple hurdles including a stock-market rout, currency-market volatility and investors' waning interest in de-SPACs, a term used to describe SPACs' eventual acquisitions of operating businesses. </p><p>   In October, Lanvin lowered its valuation from $1.25 billion to $1 billion, the same amount at which it was valued after a private fundraising round last year. The company blamed the reduced valuation on foreign-exchange fluctuations and the declining valuations of its bigger rivals such as LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE and Kering. </p><p>   Lanvin owns five brands that were acquired by Fosun, a Shanghai-based conglomerate co-founded by Chinese billionaire Guo Guangchang. Fosun was once known as one of the most deal-hungry Chinese companies, making a spate of acquisitions before Beijing cracked down on outbound investments a few years ago. </p><p>   The flagship in the portfolio is fashion house Lanvin, which was founded in 1889. Others under the group include Wolford, a high-end Austrian women's hosiery brand, Italian shoemaker Sergio Rossi, American luxury house St. John and tailoring label Caruso. </p><p>   Most fresh capital raised by the group was from outside institutional investors, including Japanese conglomerate Itochu Corp. Around 97% of the original SPAC shareholders redeemed their shares upon the merger, meaning they took back the cash invested in the shell company. </p><p>   The average redemption rate for de-SPAC transactions has shot up to 84% this year from 45% last year, according to data from SPAC Research. A rate of 84% means that investors have redeemed $84 of every $100 they put in. </p><p>   \"The biggest challenge has been getting investors to focus on a company's fundamentals in a market where SPACs have been labeled as something equal to failure,\" said Max Chen, a Primavera partner and a director of Lanvin Group. </p><p>   The change in the market environment has made investors less willing to invest in SPACs, said Benjamin Kwasnick, founder of SPAC Research. \"SPACs have always been easier in a bull market and it's not surprising that investors are staying focused on yield rather than fundamental investment in new companies right now,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
