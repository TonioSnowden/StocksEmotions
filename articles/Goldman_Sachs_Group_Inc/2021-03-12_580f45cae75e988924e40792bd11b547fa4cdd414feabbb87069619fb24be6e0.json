  "text": "<p>Jamil Anderlini (“Ma personifies the conflict in China's ideology”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fa9ed13c-25a8-4aae-900d-58333e4cea12\">Opinion</a>, March 2) seems perplexed by “the sharp and growing contradiction at the heart of the Chinese state”. </p> <p>Clarity may come if he follows the advice of the student revolutionaries, who in the 1960s and 70s, from Berlin to Baltimore, hollered: “study Mao!”</p> <p>Back in 1937 Mao wrote in his essay <em>On Contradiction</em> that “in given conditions, opposites possess identity, and consequently can coexist in a single entity”. Today Chinese communists continue to follow this tenet of Marxist dialectics.</p> <p>In 1949, Mao's victorious communists did not “just nationalise private enterprise”. Indeed, they did not declare a socialist state but a people's democracy. </p> <p>They inherited a semicolonial country dominated by feudal-paternal relationships with barely 3m industrial workers in a population of 600m. This dictated Mao's economic policy. </p> <p>In <em>On People's Democratic Rule</em>, Mao invited the “national bourgeoisie” — those he considered patriotic among the capitalists who were willing to work with the communists — to participate in building a country that would develop steadily from an agricultural one into an industrial one and from what he called “new democracy” into a socialist one. Now, perhaps because the minds of many in the west are clouded by the “let a hundred flowers bloom”, “the Great Leap Forward” and “the cultural revolution” phases of China's development, they cannot see that President Xi Jinping's policy is a modern version of the communists' plans of 1949, and so should be analysed as such.</p> <p>And, I would not worry too much about Goldman Sachs and BlackRock. If there are giant profits to be made in China, they will find a way. </p> <p><strong>Bryn Rowlands</strong> <br><em>Malmesbury, Wiltshire, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Mao is still the template for China's economy' FT.com 12 March.
