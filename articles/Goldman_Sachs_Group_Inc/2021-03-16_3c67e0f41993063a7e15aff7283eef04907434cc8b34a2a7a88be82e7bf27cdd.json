  "text": "<p>The vaccine rollout has proceeded faster than expected, making investors more optimistic about the second half. Congress has also passed an additional $1.9 trillion in fiscal stimulus to help boost the economy.</p><p>Many analysts believe the combination of factors should help consumer spending -- a powerful driver of overall economic growth -- bounce higher, especially in the second half. That in turn should be a boon to corporate profits.</p><p>\"With the reopening of the economy, this fiscal stimulus in the form of checks will have a stronger impact on consumption,\" said Carsten Brzeski , ING Groep 's global head of macro research.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 174.82 points, or 0.5%, to 32953.46, posting its 14th record close of the year.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 added 25.60 points, or 0.6%, to 3968.94, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 139.84 points, or 1%, to 13459.71.</p><p>Technology shares helped pushed indexes higher, rallying in the afternoon after starting the day mostly weaker.</p><p>Nvidia jumped $13.41, or 2.6%, to $527.64, while Akamai Technologies climbed $2.44, or 2.5%, to $99.99.</p><p>Falling oil prices put pressure on the energy sector.</p><p>Occidental Petroleum lost $1.33, or 4.3%, to $29.30, while ConocoPhillips declined $1.03, or 1.7%, to $58.16. U.S. crude oil fell 0.3% to $65.39 a barrel, extending losses after notching its biggest one-week decline since December.</p><p>AMC Entertainment soared $2.88, or 26%, to $14.04, boosted by news that it is reopening movie theaters in Los Angeles this week.</p><p>Meanwhile, a handful of stocks rose after S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices said late Friday that they would be joining the S&amp;P 500 effective March 22.

Yields fall as bond prices rise.</p><p>Later this week, investors will parse the Federal Reserve 's monetary-policy statement for guidance on policy makers' views on the economic outlook.</p><p>\"The Fed meeting will clearly be crucial and essential in terms of further educating markets as to what the Fed is up to,\" Mr. Brzeski said.</p><p>Some money managers are worried that a large fiscal package could lead to sharply higher inflation, forcing the Fed to boost interest rates sooner than policy makers have suggested they would.</p><p>\"The Fed needs to send a message here that it is still mindful of the substantial progress that is required before the economy is returned to prepandemic conditions, but equally, it's not going to be too forceful because some of these moves are warranted based on fundamentals,\" said James Ashley, head of international market strategy at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"So it is, how do you calibrate that message in a way that is neither too dovish or too hawkish.\"</p><p>In currency markets, the WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of other currencies, was up 0.1%.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 ended unchanged.</p><p>Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average was up 0.6%, the Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.2%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.8% and South Korea's Kospi was up 0.2%.
