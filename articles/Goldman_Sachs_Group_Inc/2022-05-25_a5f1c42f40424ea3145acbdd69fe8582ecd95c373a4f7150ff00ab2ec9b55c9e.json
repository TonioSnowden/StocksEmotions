  "text": "<p>   Lest anyone think that William Galston's column \"Bill Clinton's Recipe for Economic Growth\" (Politics &amp; Ideas, May 18) contains a complete listing of ingredients, there are a few others that should be added to the mix. </p><p>   First, credit former President Clinton with realizing that the first two years of his administration were a failure and changes in personnel and direction were needed. A key change was the removal of Lloyd Bentsen as Treasury secretary. He was replaced by Robert Rubin, a savvy Goldman Sachs executive who proved to be an excellent secretary. </p><p>   Second, the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 put real discipline in the spending process. It expired in 2002. Nothing since has provided the spending controls that existed with it and its predecessor, Gramm-Rudman. </p><p>   Third, Mr. Clinton had a Republican Congress that took the lead on many economic issues. At least the president was sufficiently focused on real solutions to work with them. </p><p>   Fourth, the late 1990s was a time of a burgeoning internet economy, providing growth as well as a sense of optimism for the opportunities to come. Mr. Clinton happened to be president during this time. He will take political credit and left-leaning pundits will be glad to give it to him. But as always, a successful economy is the result of a good business environment, an empowered private sector and a government that plays its proper role to support and encourage the success of its citizens. </p><p>   Ron Busick </p><p>   San Diego </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Critics suggest the Clinton administration \"capitulated to the ideology of the unfettered market,\" writes Mr. Galston, who gives the administration credit for the substantial and widespread gains that followed. But Mr. Clinton doubled down on progressive credit-allocation policies regarding home-mortgage finance. For Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, already enjoying the carrots of cheap credit and low taxes, the quotas for high-risk lending to low-income, minority and inner-city applicants were approximately doubled. For commercial banks that had similar benefits as a consequence of federally backed deposit insurance, the additional carrots of deregulated branching, mergers and acquisitions were made subject to a now-public Community Reinvestment Act score. </p><p>   In response, additional mortgage lending of about $5 trillion over the following decade outpaced the additional housing by about 10 to 1, resulting in a house-price bubble five times greater than at any time in history. When this bubble burst in 2007, a global recession ensued and financial institutions lost trillions of dollars to mortgage default, the financial system was saved only by the extraordinary efforts of the Bernanke Federal Reserve. Unfortunately, this Fed medicine was so addictive that the Fed has since been the nation's largest mortgage financier, leaving the Fed relatively defenseless before the looming recession. </p><p>   Kevin Villani </p><p>   La Jolla, Calif. </p><p>   Mr. Villani is a former chief economist at HUD (1979-82) and Freddie Mac (1982-85). </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Mr. Galston writes, \"In our effort to respond to the pandemic generously and humanely, we lost our balance. We have learned the hard way that demand doesn't automatically create its own supply and that bad things happen when too much money chases too few goods.\" These were not new learnings for many of us. Unfortunately, economic illiterates are in charge. </p><p>   Mike Mata </p><p>   St. Paul, Minn. </p><p></p>",
