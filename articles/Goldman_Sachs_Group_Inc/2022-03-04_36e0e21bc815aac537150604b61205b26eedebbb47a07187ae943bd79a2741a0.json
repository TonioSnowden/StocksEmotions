  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>If you missed Thursday's FT Business of Football Summit, you can catch up on-demand <a href=\"https://businessoffootball.live.ft.com/agenda\">here</a>. Some key moments:</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Uefa </strong>president <strong>Aleksander Ceferin </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0525c15-a370-4b20-8f65-e10d667a9cdf\">said it's “impossible”</a> to tell how sport's boycott of Russia would end.</p></li>  <li><p>British financier<strong> Amanda Staveley </strong>said it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b7c2d52-a2a5-4d34-aff6-a770108b2c29'\">wasn't “particularly fair”</a> that Russian oligarch <strong>Roman Abramovich</strong> had to put <strong>Chelsea </strong>up for sale as a result of the war in Ukraine.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Juventus</strong> chair<strong> Andrea Agnelli </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f2ecab33-14bb-46d5-9d90-c3fbfe7a68fd\">said he didn't see</a> a thwarted attempt to launch a <strong>European Super League</strong> last year as a failure.</p></li> </ul> <h2>The ‘Spac king' with loans from Credit Suisse</h2> <p><strong>Chamath Palihapitiya</strong>, the venture capitalist turned blank-cheque hype-man who helped turn the asset class into a capital markets sensation, touted large personal investments when plugging his deals and called for others to put more “skin in the game”.</p> <p>But Palihapitiya's definition of “investment” charitably includes his use of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7362411-33b2-4150-b347-a32cc4657360?\">$200mn in personal loans</a> taken out from <strong>Credit Suisse </strong>to leverage his holdings and lower his actual investment costs closer to zero, DD's Miles Kruppa and Antoine Gara report. &#xa0;</p> <p>The “Spac king”, as Palihapitiya is dubbed, borrowed $100mn from the Swiss bank to make a personal investment in <strong>Virgin Galactic</strong>, the space tourism company that merged with a vehicle sponsored by Palihapitiya in October 2019 and jump-started the Spac frenzy.</p> <p>He also borrowed to finance an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8827776-5680-4d51-94bf-128f394b742e\">equal-sized investment</a> in insurer <strong>Clover Health </strong>the following year, as retail investors piled into Spacs and the market boomed.</p> <p>The borrowing arrangements run counter to Palihapitiya's representations. When the Financial Times asked in 2020 whether he had taken out a loan to finance his $100mn investment in Virgin Galactic, Palihapitiya denied it, writing: “That is NOT correct.”</p> <p>In fact, filings indicate that he pledged his shares as collateral for the borrowing arrangements, a manoeuvre that effectively lowered his cost to zero while piling on extra risk. During market declines, lenders may request more collateral from borrowers, who could be forced to offload their stock.</p> <p>A spokesperson for Palihapitiya's firm, <strong>Social Capital</strong>, now responds that it would be “both disingenuous and naive” to position his borrowing as “new, novel or unusual”.</p> <p>Palihapitiya was chair of Virgin Galactic when he pledged shares in the company to Credit Suisse. Most large US companies forbid executives and investors from the practice, which the proxy adviser <strong>Institutional Shareholder Services</strong> said was “not a responsible use of equity” in 2013.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8869033.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Palihapitiya has sold all of his personal investment in Virgin Galactic, realising hundreds of millions of dollars in profits before the stock later cratered. He<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7637c771-1020-46ad-8243-b1f86394a180\"> stepped down</a> as chair in February. Virgin Galactic shares now trade at $8.25 — 80 per cent below record highs.</p> <p>Palihapitiya, who also took digital real estate broker <strong>Opendoor Technologies </strong>and fintech company <strong>SoFi </strong>public using Spacs, has not exited Clover, which has fallen from a high of $28 to below $3 per share.</p> <p>The debt hangover is part of a downturn that has cut into Palihapitiya's returns, which he has <a href=\"https://www.socialcapital.com/annual-letters/2020\">touted as better</a> than those of <strong>Warren Buffett</strong>'s<strong> Berkshire Hathaway</strong> in its early years.</p> <p>Palihapitiya has broken even on $200mn he invested into unaffiliated blank cheque companies and seen profits on the completed Spacs he sponsored fall from the billions to about $500mn, according to calculations from <strong>Michael Ohlrogge</strong>, a Spac expert at <strong>New York University</strong>. </p> <p>“In many ways, the Spac phenomenon represents a kind of mass delusion,” Ohlrogge told DD.</p> <p>Investors assumed sponsors like Palihapitiya instantly made their companies more valuable, said Ohlrogge, adding: “It would be a great thing for society if we had many such magical individuals . . . In truth though, they're pretty hard to come by.”</p> <h2>The queen of the bull market still has faith</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4df2b4cf-2ffe-4db5-9594-47e05e1e2240\"><strong>Cathie Wood</strong></a> was “born with the gift of faith”, she once told an interviewer on the podcast <em>Jesus Calling</em>. </p> <p>Her belief in a higher power led her through multiple stock market crashes, past doubtful investors and eventually to build the Ark that would carry her to the top of the financial zeitgeist. </p> <p>With the help of her mentor, economist <strong>Arthur Laffer</strong>, and early investment from <strong>Archegos</strong> founder <strong>Bill Hwang</strong>, Wood launched <strong>Ark Invest</strong> — named after the chest said to have held the Ten Commandments — and championed actively-managed exchange traded funds, a structure that combines the stock selection associated with mutual funds with the tax and transparency benefits of ETFs.</p> <p>Her voyage hasn't been without rough seas, as chronicled in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a93f4de2-35d2-44e1-a6a1-0000cba0dd4d\">this magazine story</a> by the FT's Harriet Agnew. Outsize bets on disruptive tech companies were a hard sell in a market dominated by passive giants <strong>BlackRock</strong>, <strong>Vanguard Group </strong>and <strong>State Street</strong>.</p> <p>That is until Wood found a fellow tech evangelist who shared her bullish beliefs: <strong>Elon Musk</strong>. In February 2019, <strong>Tesla</strong>'s stock, of which Ark held a significant amount, was trading at about $60. But Wood estimated that the electric carmaker's share price could reach $3,000 by 2025. Musk agreed.</p> <p>Ark's Tesla position, combined with a pandemic-era boost to the technologies that underpin Ark's ETFs, led to the group nearly tripling its assets to $29bn in 2020. </p> <p>The fund's stellar long-term record — generating an average return of 38 per cent a year over the past five years — keeps Wood's most loyal disciples coming back for more.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8841086.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>But most of its longer-term returns came when it had a much smaller asset base, meaning that “<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/01/12/cathie-woods-ark-portfolio-is-headed-for-shipwreck-and-plunging-tech-stocks-arent-even-the-worst-of-it/\">most investors in Ark's funds are underwater</a>”. Assets in Ark's ETFs have dropped to $23.1bn since its 2021 high. </p> <p>Wood's critics argue that faith alone isn't enough to bring back Ark's glory days. “She tells a whole story that's almost impervious to facts,” said a top executive at a multitrillion-dollar asset manager.</p> <p>But Wood still has a fan in Musk. “Cathie and the Ark team think deeply about the future and are mostly correct,” the Tesla founder wrote to the FT.</p> <p>Like Musk, Wood shrugs off her fervent team of critics. “Battling the traditional world order is what we're doing,” she said. </p> <h2>Lazard snags a top dealmaker to head up its German office</h2> <p><strong>Lazard </strong>has lost ground to its investment banking rivals over the years.</p> <p>In 2019, its polarising star dealmaker <strong>Matthieu Pigasse</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5e623c0-f35c-11e9-b018-3ef8794b17c6\">quit as head of its European </a>operations to launch the Paris business of <strong>Centerview</strong> <strong>Partners</strong>, one of America's top investment banks, along with two other former Lazard bankers, <strong>Nicolas Constant</strong> and <strong>Pierre Pasqual</strong>.</p> <p>The boutique then <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ddb24a4-fef3-11e9-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47\">enlisted</a><strong> Peter Orszag</strong>, wunderkind economist turned adviser to <strong>Barack Obama</strong>, to refresh its advisory business and lead the charge for bigger deals. Several years later and a banner period for M&amp;A, Orszag's efforts appear to be paying off.</p> <p><strong>Marcus Schenck</strong>, the industry heavyweight who rose through the ranks at<strong> Goldman Sachs</strong> and <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> before landing at <strong>Perella Weinberg Partners</strong> to lead its German advisory unit, is joining <strong>Lazard </strong>to head up its investment banking business in Munich.</p> <p>The former co-head of Deutsche's investment bank joined Perella's Frankfurt office in 2018 after missing out on the German lender's chief executive role.</p> <p>Given all that has been on Deutsche boss <strong>Christian Sewing</strong>'s plate <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd475769-4e48-4197-8c52-123389a2e63e\">lately</a>, Schenck is likely happy to be headed towards greener pastures.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>India's state-run<strong> Life Insurance Corporation </strong><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-03/india-s-lic-appoints-insurance-veteran-as-cfo-ahead-of-mega-ipo?sref=OziMsGoK\">has appointed</a> <strong>Sunil Agrawal</strong> as its new chief financial officer, per Bloomberg, ahead of the insurer's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9738e8ff-4425-4c6d-acba-aa8b3adb9926\">blockbuster IPO</a>. He was previously CFO of rival <strong>Reliance Nippon Life Insurance</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>' global co-head of industrials investment banking <strong>Clare Scherrer</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-02/goldman-industrials-dealmaker-clare-scherrer-is-leaving-the-firm?sref=OziMsGoK\">is leaving</a>, per Bloomberg. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Visa</strong> has hired former <strong>BlackRock</strong> chief marketing officer <strong>Frank Cooper III </strong>as its chief marketing officer.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Schroders</strong> has appointed<strong> InterContinental Hotels Group </strong>CFO and head of strategy<strong> Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson </strong>as an independent non-executive director to its board.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Above the law </strong>City law firms aiding Russian clients must re-evaluate their rosters or <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71468746-5e48-493a-8d13-c4b520c9ee22\">risk being on the wrong side of history</a>, the FT's Cat Rutter Pooley writes.</p> <p><strong>There goes the neighbourhood </strong>Despite the US spending billions to protect vulnerable tenants during the pandemic, an <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-evictions-monarch-investment-rental-properties/?srnd=premium&amp;sref=OziMsGoK\">eviction crisis</a> was unfolding all along. Many evictions were issued by Monarch Investment, Middle America's fastest-growing landlord, Bloomberg reports.</p> <p><strong>Off the cuff</strong> “Dreams do not have a price tag!” Dior's Pietro Beccari said in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eb7349fa-b8c3-4fc8-9830-a84587db15d5\">interview with the FT</a>. It remains to be seen whether his appetite for risk is sustainable in the long run.</p> <h2>News round-up</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c412673-d65e-4e75-adbb-08146c42387c\">Accenture and McKinsey join corporate stampede to exit Russia</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c2552db-b235-46d1-8801-bc15836a310d\">France and Germany detain Russian oligarch superyachts</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ccd61c2-0c4d-48ec-bcda-03ad0bb6f85c\">UK PM faces pressure to sack Tory fundraiser over links to Russian money</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/161af0cd-8975-4fb7-809c-131436a91cc0\">Purdue and US states agree new $6bn settlement for opioid litigation</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d792382-dfae-4fe6-952b-dc9bdcad08f8\">London Stock Exchange suspends 27 companies with Russian ties</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/523fdd02-05c0-45f5-97be-7026842ba76f\">CNN makes a $350mn bet on streaming ahead of Discovery takeover</a> (FT) &#xa0;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff11c125-c009-48a8-88c2-cec9b1facab8\">Peloton founder sells $50mn in stock to MSD Partners</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-banks-scramble-workarounds-russia-sanctions-impinge-2022-03-03/\">Chinese banks scramble for ‘workarounds' as Russia sanctions impinge</a> (Reuters) </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-closed-russia-market-after-invasion-challenges-u-s-fund-managers-11646303401?mod=hp_lead_pos4\">A closed Russia market after invasion challenges US fund managers</a> (FT) </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-russian-firms-rush-open-chinese-bank-accounts-sanctions-bite-sources-2022-03-03/\">Russian firms rush to open Chinese bank accounts</a> (Reuters) </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29230751-02a9-4afa-8c53-d672fc34e000\">Generali plans to cut ties with Russia</a> (FT)</p><p>Source:  2022 'The King of Spacs and Queen of stonks face reality' FT.com 4 March.
