  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Blackstone Earnings  Jump as Investment  Portfolio Appreciates  ----  By Miriam Gottfried",
  "text": "<p>   Blackstone Group Inc.'s earnings jumped in the second quarter, propelled by record appreciation in the value of its investments. </p><p>   The private-equity firm posted second-quarter net income of $1.31 billion, or $1.82 a share, it said Thursday. That compares with a profit of $568.3 million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier. </p><p>   The value of Blackstone's private-equity portfolio climbed by 14% in the latest period, exceeding the roughly 8% gain for the S&amp;P 500. Combined fund appreciation across its various business lines was the highest in the history of the firm. </p><p>   Aiding the strong performance was Blackstone's recent emphasis on putting money into fast-growing companies. Initial public offerings of outsourcing company TaskUs Inc. and Indian electric-vehicle components manufacturer Sona BLW Precision Forgings Ltd. pushed up the firm's private-equity portfolio, while sales of last-mile logistics properties in the U.S. and Australia helped boost its real-estate holdings. </p><p>   Blackstone President Jonathan Gray has encouraged the firm's business heads to think more thematically about investing, identifying global trends and finding ways to put money to work in areas that would benefit from them. Among these are logistics, software, digital payments and life sciences, areas of the economy that are experiencing outsize growth. </p><p>   \"The pivot into good neighborhoods has really paid off,\" Mr. Gray said in an interview. </p><p>   Investors cheered the results, sending Blackstone's stock up 4.1% to $110.13. Its shares, including dividends, have climbed 79% since the beginning of 2021, according to FactSet, trouncing the S&amp;P 500's roughly 19% gain over the period. </p><p>   Blackstone's market capitalization of more than $130 billion exceeds that of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the Wall Street firm valued at about $127 billion. </p><p>   \"Our forward momentum has never been stronger,\" Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman, who has long complained that Blackstone's stock price didn't reflect its performance, said on a conference call with analysts. </p><p>   He called the second quarter \"the most consequential\" ever for the firm, as it expanded further into the retail and insurance channels. These areas generate perpetual capital, which public investors value because it doesn't need to be returned as quickly and generates a steady stream of locked-in fees. </p><p>   Blackstone's distributable earnings, or the amount of cash that could be returned to shareholders, came in at $1.07 billion, or 82 cents a share, in the quarter. That compares with $548 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. </p><p>   The firm said it would pay a dividend of 70 cents a share for the quarter, versus 37 cents in the second quarter of 2020. </p><p>   Blackstone invested $23.8 billion during the second quarter and committed to an additional $28.5 billion. </p><p></p>",
