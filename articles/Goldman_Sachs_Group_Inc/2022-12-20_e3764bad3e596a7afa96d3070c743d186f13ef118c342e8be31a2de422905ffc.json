  "text": "<p>Investment group Sixth Street Partners extended its recent dealmaking spree, leading a $2.3bn loan to help fund the $6.4bn leveraged buyout of satellite operator Maxar Technologies, said people with knowledge of the transaction.</p> <p>The financing package comes just days after Sixth Street led a $2.6bn loan to back Thoma Bravo's $8bn purchase of business software provider <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff46476f-8eb3-46ae-b021-2a380984d6cc\">Coupa Software</a>, underlining the firm's deep push into credit markets and its ability to fill a void left by banks in the leveraged buyout industry. </p> <p>Sixth Street and a group of other direct lenders beat out a competing loan offered by a number of Wall Street banks, the people added. The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/abdbdbbd-f4b4-47a3-a4f3-e2164a76db07\">takeover </a>of Maxar by private equity group Advent International was announced on Friday, but details of the debt financing had not been disclosed.</p> <p>Sixth Street has become one of the go-to lenders for buyouts, gaining share at a time when many regulated banks have been wary of extending risky corporate loans. The San Francisco-based group in late October also participated in a private loan to fund Blackstone's purchase of a majority stake in Emerson Electric's climate technologies business.</p> <p>Its presence has been critical to private equity groups during the recent downturn, as the Federal Reserve's campaign to aggressively lift interest rates froze some credit markets.</p> <p>Banks typically agree to provide funding for deals, then sell the debt on to other investors. If demand for leveraged loans falls between the time when a transaction is agreed and when it is completed, the banks are either forced to sell at a loss or keep the loans until markets improve. </p> <p>Many Wall Street lenders have pulled back from buyouts as a result. A group of banks that includes Morgan Stanley and Bank of America is still sitting on $12.7bn of debt provided to Elon Musk for his purchase of Twitter, with investors showing little interest without steep discounts. </p> <p>Sixth Street was launched in 2009 by a coterie of Goldman Sachs alumni within TPG, who ran the private equity firm's credit business. In 2020 it was spun-off from TPG and it has grown rapidly, managing more than $60bn today.</p><p>Source: Eric Platt in New York 2022 'Sixth Street leads $2.3bn debt package for Maxar Technologies buyout' FT.com 20 December.
