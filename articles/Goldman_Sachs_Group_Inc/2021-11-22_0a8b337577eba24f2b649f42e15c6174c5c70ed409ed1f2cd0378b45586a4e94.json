  "text": "<p>The letter emphasized the Menlo Park, Calif.-based firm's commitment to seeking out deals at earlier stages. This is being driven in part by rising valuations and auction-style deal-making across the market where potential investors attempt to outbid each other to win an investment, the letter said. \"Diligence has fallen and excess is in excess,\" the letter said about this deal-making environment.</p><p>The firm should focus on \"finding founders earlier and earlier,\" being the first firm to write a check for a startup and helping more startups to form in-house, the letter said.</p><p>Lux raised a $675 million early-stage fund earlier this year, joining other venture firms including Andreessen Horowitz and Greylock Partners that are amassing war chests to target early-stage companies.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>IPOs keep jumping higher. Initial public offerings have broken record after record this year. So far, more than 900 companies have gone public, raising nearly $300 billion. Quietly, the market for publicly traded companies also did something it hadn't done in years: It got bigger, The Wall Street Journal's Corrie Driebusch reports.</p><p>For two decades, America's roster of public companies had dwindled. Mergers and acquisitions boomed, plucking ticker symbol after ticker symbol off stock exchanges. Mountains of private investment and the hassle of regulations kept startups from feeling the need to go public. This year, that started to change. The number of publicly listed companies in the U.S. rose above 4,000 for the first time in more than a decade, according to the Center for Research in Security Prices LLC.</p><p>The reasons ranged from a surge of cash provided by Washington, D.C., to a search for new and bigger returns as interest rates hovered near zero. Startups that desperately needed cash added more fuel to the frenzy, as did newly popular \"blank-check\" companies whose only purpose was to acquire a private target and take it public.</p><p>$1.4 Billion</p><p>The size of a Series A round for Sierra Space, a Colorado-based startup working toward the launch of a winged commercial spaceplane.</p><p>Intarcia Therapeutics Takes One Last Shot at FDA Approval</p><p>Intarcia Therapeutics Inc., once among the most promising emerging companies in biotech, is taking a rarely used route to dispute Food and Drug Administration rejections of its Type 2 diabetes treatment, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Intarcia was once valued at $4.2 billion on the promise of a matchstick-sized implant that delivers the Type 2 diabetes medicine exenatide, a drug now given by daily or weekly injection. By eliminating shots, Intarcia aimed to keep more patients on their medication.</p><p>The FDA has already cleared exenatide and the implanted device, which was used in a prostate-cancer treatment. Both were first developed by other companies. But the agency has twice rejected Intarcia's combination of the two, most recently last year.</p><p>Investors have since lost all their equity in Intarcia, whose assets are now in a holding company. But the company is taking a final shot at FDA approval through a process that allows it to request a hearing to resolve factual disputes about the drug.</p><p>Citadel CEO Outbid Crypto Investors for Copy of U.S. Constitution</p><p>Chicago hedge-fund billionaire Kenneth Griffin said he won a $43.2 million first-edition copy of the U.S. Constitution at a Sotheby's auction on Thursday—and now he intends to lend it to a free Arkansas art museum. The 53-year-old founder and chief executive of Citadel caused a stir Thursday when he outbid a large group of cryptocurrency investors who had crowdfunded more than $40 million earlier in the week in a frenzied attempt to win the document, the last surviving first edition in private hands.</p><p>Industry News</p><p>IPO Tracking</p><p>Vigil Neuroscience Inc., a startup harnessing the power of microglia immune cells in the brain to treat neurodegenerative diseases, filed for an initial public offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to Dow Jones Newswires.
