  "text": "<p>Investors are awaiting an update from the Fed at 2 p.m. ET, followed by a press conference, that will signal whether the central bank will act more forcefully to temper inflation.</p><p>U.S. consumer prices hit a 39-year high Friday and producer prices notched a record this week. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said recently that the central bank is prepared to accelerate tapering, clearing the way to raise interest rates next year, despite the risks to economic growth posed by the Omicron variant.</p><p>\"What's really coming in context is that inflation is hotter for longer than expected and the Fed is acknowledging it,\" said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank. \"There's also the view that new variants are not just a concern for growth, but a concern for inflation.\"</p><p>Oil prices fell Wednesday, with global benchmark Brent crude declining 1.1%, as expectations of a faster pullback in Fed stimulus weighed on prices. The International Energy Agency said Tuesday it had reduced its forecast for 2022 energy demand, due to Omicron, and cut its supply outlook.</p><p>This comes as more information is emerging about the Omicron variant. The first large real-world study showed that the efficacy of two Pfizer shots declined against the strain, both for infection and hospitalization. The variant currently accounts for about 3% of cases in the U.S.</p><p>\"Companies and consumers have become very good at adapting to these variants,\" Ms. Dwek said. The key risk is supply-chain disruptions lasting longer than expected because of China's zero-Covid policy, she added.</p><p>Retail sales rose by a seasonally-adjusted 0.3% in November, slowing from October's pace and coming in below expectations. Economists had predicted an 0.8% increase amid the holiday shopping season.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged up to 1.448% Wednesday from 1.437% Tuesday.</p><p>Among individual stocks, Eli Lilly shares climbed 6.5% after the pharmaceutical company raised its full-year guidance. Shares of chemical firm Albemarle slid 4.7% after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the stock.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.1%. In Asia, most major benchmarks closed down. The Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.4%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 0.9%. Data showed China's economic activity slowed in November, driven by a property slump and sluggish consumer spending.</p><p>â€”Karen Langley contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Slip, Oil Falls Ahead of Fed Decision</p>",
