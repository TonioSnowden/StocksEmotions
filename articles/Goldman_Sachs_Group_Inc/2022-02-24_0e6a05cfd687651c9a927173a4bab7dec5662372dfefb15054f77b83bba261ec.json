  "title": "Treasury Yields Fall After Russia Attacks Ukraine; Yield on 10-year Treasury note recently traded at 1.912%, down from 1.976% Wednesday",
  "text": "<p>Investors typically sell riskier assets like stocks and buy haven assets like Treasurys when war escalates, expecting the conflict to slow economic growth. Major U.S. stock indexes lost about 2% Thursday morning following the Russian attack, while stocks in Asia and Europe also fell sharply.</p><p>Thursday's yield fall reverses the recent U.S. Treasury market selloff, which pushed the 10-year yield above 2% for the first time since mid-2019. Many investors have been betting that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates and remove stimulus measures in an effort to fight high inflation, sending yields rising.</p><p>Now, some are starting to question if Russia's attack on Ukraine may have implications for the Fed's policy outlook. The current conflict may differ from past events that led the Fed to delay tightening monetary policy because inflation has created a stronger and more urgent reason to tighten, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a Thursday note to clients.</p><p>\"We do not expect geopolitical risk to stop the [Fed] from hiking steadily by [0.25 percentage point] at its upcoming meetings, though we do think that geopolitical uncertainty further lowers the odds of a [0.5-percentage-point] hike in March,\" they wrote.</p><p>Federal-funds futures, which investors use to bet on central bank policy, showed a 13% chance that the Fed raises short-term interest rates by 0.5 percentage point at the next policy meeting in March, according to CME Group, down from over 33% Wednesday.</p><p>Analysts and investors pay close attention to Treasury yields because they set a floor on borrowing costs and are a key input in financial models used to value stocks and other assets. This year's climb has helped drive up mortgage rates and contributed to declines in stocks and other speculative bets including cryptocurrencies and unprofitable technology company shares.</p><p>Write to Sebastian Pellejero at sebastian.pellejero@wsj.com</p><p>Treasury Yields Fall After Russia Attacks Ukraine</p>",
