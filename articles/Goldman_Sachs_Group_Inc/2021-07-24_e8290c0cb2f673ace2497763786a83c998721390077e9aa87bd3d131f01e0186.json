  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management and Germany's DWS are preparing bids for NN Group's investment management arm as consolidation in the industry gathers pace.</p> <p>The Dutch insurer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1353dfac-6e60-49ff-aeef-5d19e8a197e9\">said in April</a> it was considering a sale of NN Investment Partners, which has €300bn in assets under management. </p> <p>The deadline for final binding offers is Monday. GSAM, which has more than $2tn in assets under supervision, and Frankfurt-based DWS are still in the sale process and preparing bids, said people familiar with the situation. </p> <p>The deal price is in the region of €1.4bn, one of the people said. NN Group, GSAM and DWS declined to comment.</p> <p>UBS Asset Management, Janus Henderson and US insurer Prudential Financial are among those to have previously registered their interest. All three declined to comment.</p> <p>Investment managers globally are embarking on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/092d8b5c-14cd-4499-9745-a1bc71cc951d\">mergers and acquisitions</a> designed to shield profits from rising costs and falling fees, while seeking to tap into fast-growing markets such as passive investing, private assets and ESG, and open up new distribution channels.</p> <p>“The competitive environment for traditional active asset managers has intensified and a smaller group of larger players are now dominating the institutional segment,” said Vincent Bounie, senior managing director at Fenchurch Advisory, a specialist investment bank for financial services.</p> <p>“It has become complicated to grow and very difficult to have a profitable business, in particular if you have undifferentiated plain vanilla products.”</p> <p>Asoka Woehrmann, chief executive of DWS, which is majority owned by Deutsche Bank, told shareholders at the €820bn group's annual meeting last month that it wanted to be “an active player” in industry consolidation. It is seeking further scale to challenge rival Amundi for supremacy in Europe.</p> <p>Meanwhile for insurance companies, a prolonged period of low interest rates and higher capital requirements under <a href=\"https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en/knowledge/publications/f12a4a4a/ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-solvency-ii\">Solvency II</a> rules is prompting groups to weigh up where they allocate their capital, Bounie said. “For many of them, subscale asset management divisions are no longer core activities and there will probably be more divestments.”</p> <p>NN Group, which is based in The Hague, came under pressure last year from activist hedge fund Elliott Management to improve returns and streamline its operations. It said in April it was considering options including a merger, joint venture or a partial divestment of the division.</p> <p>NN Investment Partners has about 950 employees. Of its €300bn in assets under management, two-thirds is managed on behalf of its insurance parent company with the remaining third run for external investors.</p> <p>The division's range of funds covers fixed income, equity, multi-asset and alternative investment strategies. It has a strong position in ESG investing, notably in areas such as green bonds, impact equity and sustainable equity.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Ian Smith in London </em></p><p>Source: Harriet Agnew, Asset Management Editor 2021 'Goldman and DWS prepare bids for NN Investment Partners ' FT.com 24 July.
