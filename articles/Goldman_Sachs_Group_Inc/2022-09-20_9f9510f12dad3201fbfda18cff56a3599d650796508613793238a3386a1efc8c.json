  "text": "<p>I work from home one day per week. During my most recent eight-hour toiling-from-the-sofa session, I conducted an important meeting on Zoom. As I turned on my camera, primed and prepped to face my team, I realised with a jerk of horror that I was still wearing the bright pink “I heart NY” baseball cap I'd put on to hold back my freshly washed hair earlier that morning. Reluctant to take it off, for fear of my hair falling clumsily over my forehead, I decided to brave it, running through my presentation looking less like a person of substance and more like a character from <em>Stranger Things</em>.</p> <p>No one batted an eyelid — least as far as I could tell from the thumbnailed faces staring back at me from my 11-inch screen. But it was a scenario that left me wondering: is it now OK, in our freshly casualised, post-lockdown world, to wear caps in the workplace? </p> <p>Miranda Collinge, the deputy editor of Esquire magazine, takes the view that “there was probably a time when the sight of a baseball cap in the office would have had men's style magazine journalists tearing out their cufflinks in despair. But I think that kind of stuffiness has been on the way out for a while, and was obviously expedited considerably by the recent work-from-home Zoom-a-thon,” she says.</p> <p>Though Collinge doesn't believe anyone would care about an employee wearing a baseball cap within a creative company like Hearst, which owns Esquire, she draws the line at anything other than a peak-brimmed head covering. “It should be said that it only seems to be baseball caps and, at a push, beanies, that have made the leap [into acceptability] so far — a baker boy or a flat cap might still cause a minor stir. But equally, and not to sound all MAGA-baseball-cap about it, it's a free country, and it's your head.”</p> <p>There are, of course, certain industries where the sporting of baseball caps is essential. If you work outside, for instance, as a tennis coach or groundsman, then you almost certainly need to wear one to shield your face from the sun — as the first baseball caps did on the heads of the Brooklyn Excelsiors baseball team in 1860. Hats were worn in other industries too; in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, most gentlemen employed in the financial sector would wear bowler or top hats — depending on their social standing — to work but, importantly, not at work.</p> <p>Today, finance and other serious professional environments generally take a more relaxed approach than they used to — both Goldman Sachs and PwC decreed that their employees no longer needed to wear suits and ties before the pandemic hit — and since the Covid lockdowns, employers have been forced to loosen their collars even further. It's a shift reflected in sales of suits, which dropped from £460mn in 2017 to £279mn in 2021, according to media research firm Kantar Worldpanel. Yet caps remain divisive.</p> <p>But why? Streetwear has infiltrated every aspect of our working wardrobes. Where once wearing a pair of tracksuit bottoms to the office might have got you sacked, now brands from Marks and Spencer to Paul Smith are creating two-pieces crafted from tailoring fabrics finished with sporty details such as cuffed legs and drawstring waists. Caps convey an intention to eschew the desk and pursue some kind of leisure activity, be it golf or a BBQ, or maybe it has something to do with class. Wearing hats indoors has also, traditionally speaking, been frowned upon. “Men have always removed their hats as a sign of respect to their host,” says a spokesperson for hat maker Christys' London. “If a gentleman was in a public lift and a lady entered, he took off his hat as a matter of courtesy and respect.”</p> <p>“Our business spans a clothing chasm — from the traditional finance suit through to very relaxed techy attire, but for my team, caps are a no-no,” says Alex Livanis, head of investment at a London-based fintech company. “Clothing reflects shared values and norms. The formality encourages a sense of respect for our clients and our team internally.” </p> <p>It's a point on which I'm inclined to agree. Not only does a dress code or accepted uniform in a workplace encourage a certain level of professionalism, but it also makes those who adhere to it feel part of something. Baseball caps, by way of their somehow priapic posturing, seem antithetical to that, singling out their wearers as wilful “cap wearers” rather than biddable players in a wider team. </p> <p>It's a view only partially shared by financial adviser Jaryd McCormack. “I'm absolutely fine with staff wearing caps and feeling comfortable in casual clothes in the office,” says McCormack, “but of course, for an external client meeting I would recommend they are removed. The Covid break changed a lot in our attitude towards our internal dress code. We feel as though clients appreciate a smart-casual fashion approach to clothing rather than the norm of formal business attire. This could help in changing some of the stigmas associated with finance professionals.”</p> <p>So far, so indeterminate. Personally speaking, I believe that the question of whether caps can or should be worn in the office must be considered on a case-by-case basis. If you're the boss, like Logan or Kendall Roy in their Loro Piana caps, then go for your life, it's your company. If you work in a creative environment and a baseball cap forms either part of your look or acts as a way of covering up something head-based you want to conceal, then it's probably OK. In more traditional workplaces, trading floors and legal chambers, it's arguably less acceptable (not least if said cap is bright pink and was purchased from a tourist tat shop in downtown Manhattan). The final word, however, must go to Peter York, co-author of <em>The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook</em> and god of all things etiquette-related.</p> <p>“Cap wearing in the workplace must be stopped,” says York. “They make their wearers look silly. Indeed, wearing one is like saying ‘I'm being jaunty and youthful, but in fact I'm 45.' It's just terrible.”</p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/financialtimesfashion/?hl=en\"><em>@financialtimesfashion</em></a><em> on Instagram</em></p><p>Source: Teo van den Broeke 2022 'Baseball caps are back, but what about in the office?'
