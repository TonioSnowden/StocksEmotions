  "text": "<p>For thousands of traders, fund managers and analysts, the message that Eikon is down has in recent months become a wearily familiar one.</p> <p>With its orange and black trading screens, Refinitiv's flagship product has for the past three decades been locked in battle with Bloomberg's terminals to be the top provider of data and market-moving news across the world's financial capitals.</p> <p>A disruption to Eikon last Wednesday was the third major outage since April, a period littered with smaller ones. As well as testing the patience of users, the incidents are deepening the pressure on the London Stock Exchange Group. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3a4eb00-b501-11e9-bec9-fdcab53d6959\">The FTSE 100 company agreed to buy Refinitiv </a>in a $27bn deal in 2019, arguing it would complete its transformation from an exchange operator into a group that also controlled the lucrative data at the heart of financial markets.</p> <p>Almost two years later, the initially rapturous reception from investors has given way to a more sober examination of the challenges LSE chief executive David Schwimmer faces in making the biggest deal in the company's recent history pay off.</p> <p>A fitful service at Eikon is not the only headache. David Craig, the former head of Refinitiv whose importance the LSE highlighted in its prospectus for the deal, is stepping down in July. Refinitiv is also embroiled in a dispute with news provider Reuters over an unusual three-decade long contract costing $325m a year.</p> <p>“The old LSE business could not grow in perpetuity so it needed to do a deal,” said Rupak Ghose, an adviser to fintech and market infrastructure companies who believes that the combined group will do well to meet its revenue targets over the next five years.</p> <p>Schwimmer, who sealed the takeover within a year of succeeding Xavier Rolet as chief executive, will have the chance on Friday to dispel concerns when the LSE holds an event designed to educate investors about Refinitiv.</p> <p>The former Goldman Sachs banker insists that the past four months — the LSE only took official control of Refinitiv earlier this year after a protracted probe of the deal by European competition regulators — offer little cause for concern, pointing to a five-year integration plan.</p> <p>“I see the last several months as ones in which we've made great progress,” Schwimmer said in an interview. “We've refinanced our debt. We made clear to the market and our shareholders that we are investing in the business to drive growth.” </p> <p>It was a warning in early March, however, that the bill for integrating Refinitiv would be heftier than expected that first took some of the gloss off the deal. LSE shares suffered their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3cd149f6-8136-42bf-9319-e861c11a89ef\">worst one-day drop</a> in more than two decades.</p> <p>According to executives from both sides, there is an acknowledgment that melding businesses with sharply contrasting different cultures will take time. The LSE is a highly regulated, centralised business accustomed to running critical market infrastructure, while Refinitiv is a sprawling technology and data group dotted with dozens of teams working on small projects.</p> <p>Given that Refinitiv commanded twice the revenues of the LSE and roughly four times its workforce, some employees at the group believed it would dominate the combined company.</p> <p>Craig, a 51-year-old Brit, had intended to speed up decision making at Refinitiv and extend that approach to the LSE, according to two people with knowledge of his plans. For his part, Schwimmer has put the focus on IT integration this year and laid out cuts in overlapping senior leadership roles.</p> <p>The relationship between the men has remained cordial, the people said, but Craig prepared for his departure by hiring his successor, former Bloomberg executive Andrea Stone. </p> <p>It was Craig's own frustrations at a lack investment from Thomson Reuters, Refinitiv's owner for the decade after the financial crisis, that led him to help engineer the $17.3bn sale of the group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1804c0cc-059e-11e8-9650-9c0ad2d7c5b5\">to a private equity consortium</a> led by Blackstone in 2018. Within 18 months the consortium had sold the business to the LSE, though it retained a 29 per cent stake.</p> <p>As equity and bond markets have enjoyed a historic bull run, it is Bloomberg, rather than Refinitiv, that has been the winner. Bloomberg's share of the market for supplying data and analytics to the financial services industry held at 33 per cent in 2020 as Refinitiv's slipped to 19.4 per cent, according to Burton-Taylor Consulting International.</p> <p>There is no easy way to eliminate the tension between needing to invest in Refinitiv while meeting the takeover's aggressive financial targets. These include cutting the LSE's net debt from more than 3.5 times its adjusted earnings to less than two times by early 2023.</p> <p>“From our perspective what is important is the commitment to deleverage,” said Donald Robertson, a senior analyst at Moody's, adding that the cost of integration was one of the biggest risks to the LSE's credit rating. </p> <p>“It's a long and complex five-year plan. They're spending a lot of money on it,” said Robertson, who has an investment grade rating of A3 on the LSE. “There will be ups and downs along the way.”</p> <p>The LSE, whose businesses stretch from the clearing house LCH to the FTSE Russell stock indices, says it is on track to meet the cost saving goals it set out for the deal. </p> <p>Before the takeover, Refinitiv had finished a $650m cost-cutting operation that eliminated jobs in expensive cities such as London and New York while shifting some product development to China. More functions have been outsourced to TCS, the Indian IT services group. </p> <p>However, the Eikon terminal and its long-term replacement, Workspace, are thirsty for investment. </p> <p>That will be vital if Refinitiv is going to compete against other industry heavyweights including Intercontinental Exchange and S&amp;P Global-IHS Markit, according to Ghose. The LSE is seeking to increase revenues between 5 per cent and 7 per cent over the next three years.</p> <p>As the more than 300-year-old company tries to wring costs from the business, Refinitiv's contract with Reuters is emerging as a significant obstacle. It adds up to a financial liability in excess of $9bn, with the annual payments from Refinitiv amounting to more than half Reuters' revenues.</p> <p>Alessandra Galloni, the recently appointed Reuters editor-in-chief, has described the contract as “the envy of the media industry”, a historic alliance providing a stream of guaranteed income. </p> <p>Yet the unorthodox terms, struck when Thomson Reuters sold Refinitiv to the Blackstone-led consortium, has put the partnership between the data provider and news service under considerable strain.</p> <p>Even before the LSE takeover, Refinitiv had raised concerns with Reuters over its news output, according to people familiar with the discussions. Reuters has won prestigious Pulitzer prizes in recent years, but was notably five hours slower than Bloomberg in reporting the Suez Canal being blocked, a vital story for Refinitiv customers.&#xa0;</p> <p>Refinitiv has struggled to secure what it wants from Reuters with a contract that only includes vague performance indicators, such as the error rate and number of breaking news snaps. Attempting the more ambitious step of reducing payments would be even harder.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The differences spilled into<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06c4fab0-9edd-494a-910c-f4b82af92b07\"> public last month when Refinitiv </a>objected to Reuters' plans to introduce a paywall for its news website, arguing it would cause it “irreparable harm”. Refinitiv warned that the move risked cannibalising its own sales while also undermining the exclusive right it has to resell Reuters' news output.</p> <p>It forced Reuters into a humiliating retreat, with the launch of the paywall postponed until the differences are resolved.&#xa0;In a joint statement, Reuters and Refinitiv said that “the foundation of our partnership is strong”. </p> <p>“Just as with any commercial agreement, there are ongoing and private discussions about our business approach and products.”</p> <p>The paywall clash might ultimately prompt a bigger reappraisal of the partnership and how it operates, according to people familiar with the matter. “The contract is a millstone around [Refinitiv's] neck”, said one person with knowledge of the negotiations.</p> <p>Few believe that Refinitiv is in immediate danger of becoming one for the LSE. </p> <p>Shares in the group are up more than 40 per cent since the deal was struck in August 2019. UK asset manager Lindsell Train, one of the LSE's largest shareholders, remains a staunch supporter of the deal, saying after the March warning on costs that management “knew Refinitiv was a business that needed work”. </p> <p>This week Schwimmer will need to spell out just how much.</p><p>Source: Philip Stafford and Alex Barker in London 2021 'Refinitiv deal loses some of its lustre for LSE as challenges mount' FT.com 30 June.
