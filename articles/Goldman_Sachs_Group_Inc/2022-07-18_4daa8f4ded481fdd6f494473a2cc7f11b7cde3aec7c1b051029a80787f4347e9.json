Falling markets and a rising dollar drove assets under management at the largest money manager down to $8.5tn.</p> <h1>The ‘big existential threat' for markets is the US</h1> <p>Six years ago <strong>Emmanuel “Manny” Roman</strong> upped sticks from London to the West Coast, to take over as chief executive of <strong>Pimco</strong>, the giant fund manager with some $2tn of assets under management. </p> <p>It was quite the change of scene for the cosmopolitan French financier and legendarily literary patron of the arts, who pre-2008 might have been dubbed a “Master of the Universe”. And not just because his social life is more limited, his wine cellar is in storage and he has to watch his beloved <strong>Arsenal</strong> on television at unreasonable hours. </p> <p>FT Weekend Editor <em>Alec Russell</em> recently sat down for a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cbc246ee-202b-4b3f-b547-dd3533da5611\">Lunch with the FT</a> with Roman at Marinos, an old Italian family restaurant in Hollywood, to hear how his two worlds intersect: the world of trading and the world of ideas. </p> <p>“They totally come together,” says Roman. </p> <blockquote>  <p>“I think markets are a very complicated impressionist painting. Different pieces contribute to the story . . . By thinking through the various sectors, stories and people you meet you get a much more holistic picture of what is happening in the economy. Some of it is by data, some of it is by anecdotal stories, some it is by lateral thinking. They are all part of the picture.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Roman's career has been a case study in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2f3ced8-5002-11e6-88c5-db83e98a590a\">impeccable timing</a>. </p> <p>After an 18-year stint at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, he joined the swashbuckling hedge fund <strong>GLG Partners</strong> in 2005, just as markets were reaching a peak, and then helped to prime it for a listing two years later, just before the crash of 2008. Two years later he orchestrated its sale to <strong>Man Group</strong>, which was later dubbed a “reverse takeover” by GLG.</p> <p>Roman's career has also coincided with years of loose monetary policy, ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing, which have allowed firms such as Pimco to prosper despite the financial crisis and the pandemic. &#xa0;</p> <p>“The post-Volcker years have been very good for financial markets and for our generation,” he says, referring to <strong>Paul Volcker</strong>, the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> chair from 1979-1987 who was credited with ending high levels of inflation. “I call that generational luck.”</p> <p>But now the decades-long bull run of the bond market which has served Pimco so well has been declared <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cb8d56a-2a0c-40f7-9977-a3ab8078a191\">at an end</a>. </p> <p>For Roman, it is inflation that keeps him up at night. </p> <blockquote>  <p>“The big existential risk for all fund managers is that something goes very wrong in the US. Because all of a sudden it's not a small position. It's a very big position. So housing for example is a near existential risk for everyone because it's just so big and there are so many ramifications, the banks, the financial system and so on.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Alec's wide-ranging interview covers everything from Roman's childhood in bohemian Paris and the “great sins” of fund managers to the “Manny myth” — that he reads a new book a week.

He is best known for the success of <strong>Brevan Howard Asset Management</strong>, the $23bn global macro firm he co-founded 20 years ago. </p> <p>But behind the scenes, he has been slowly relinquishing some of his roles at Brevan Howard to become a major force in crypto venture capital in both Europe and the US.&#xa0;&#xa0;(A person close to Howard insists he remains “heavily involved” in initiatives across Brevan.)</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e89061dd-634e-4024-b74a-5a102d4eb552\">this analysis</a>, my colleagues <em>Joshua Oliver</em> and <em>Laurence Fletcher</em> reveal how cryptocurrency-based trivia games, horseracing NFTs and so-called privacy coin groups are among a large and growing digital assets empire that the media-shy hedge fund billionaire has been quietly building. </p> <p>The FT has compiled a list of 43 investments in crypto companies and projects made by Howard over the past five years — ranging from well-known businesses like exchange <strong>FTX</strong> to smaller NFT and decentralised finance projects — based on information from venture capital databases <strong>Crunchbase</strong>, <strong>PitchBook</strong> and <strong>Dealroom</strong> and public announcements. </p> <p>Howard, who declined to be interviewed for the article, has maintained a lower profile than other major crypto investors such as <strong>Galaxy Digital</strong>'s <strong>Mike Novogratz</strong>. However he has invested alongside Galaxy on projects including the exchange <strong>Bullish Global</strong> and <strong>Derby Stars</strong>, which describes itself as “a horseracing metaverse game where players can breed, grow, build and trade”. He has also invested alongside big private equity players such as <strong>Tiger Global</strong>, <strong>SoftBank</strong> and <strong>Peter Thiel</strong>.</p> <p>In an email interview with crypto news website <em>The Block </em>in May, Howard said that crypto is “an important macro trend.” But because digital assets are still rather a new asset class, he cautioned that “it's most prudent to invest across the entire crypto ecosystem in a highly diversified manner”.</p> <p>Does the current market sell-off represent an opportunity to double down on the crypto industry?
