  "title": "Startups Build  Cash War Chests  ----  By Angus Loten",
  "text": "<p>   Many large startups continue to extend their runways to initial public offerings with increasingly later-stage funding rounds, as they build up cash war chests to hold out for more favorable market conditions, analysts say. </p><p>   But apart from stretching typical launch-to-exit life cycles of venture-backed startups, late-stage fundraising rounds risk diluting equity held by earlier investors, analysts say. </p><p>   Despite a sharp decline this year in overall venture-capital deal making, global startups between January and mid-July closed 63 Series F or later rounds -- the alphabetic system used to denote successive startup funding deals -- according to market researcher PitchBook Data Inc. </p><p>   A decade ago, startups were generally considered ripe for an IPO after their third significant fundraising round, typically labeled Series C. In 2012, for instance, there were 63 Series F or later rounds closed over the course of the entire year, PitchBook said. </p><p>   The pace of this year's late-stage funding deals is down from 2021, when a surge of investor capital lifted the number of Series F or later rounds above 200, PitchBook said. But they are roughly keeping pace with 2020, and running ahead of 2019, PitchBook said. </p><p>   \"In a tough IPO market like the one we're seeing in 2022, it could make sense to hold off,\" said Brian Lee, senior vice president of data firm CB Insights' intelligence unit. </p><p>   SingleStore, for instance, should be large enough for an IPO by next year, Raj Verma, the cloud-database startup's chief executive said, adding, \"As of right now, we are in no rush to go public.\" </p><p>   San Francisco-based SingleStore this month announced a $116 million Series F round, led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. SingleStore said it currently has a valuation of more than $1.3 billion. </p><p>   After hitting a record high in the first three months of the year, the number of late-stage funding deals closed by U.S.-based startups in the second quarter tailed off 10% to roughly 1,400, according to a separate report by PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association. The report defines late-stage as Series C or later. </p><p>   Companies that recently closed late-stage rounds are well-positioned to weather tougher economic times, said Conor Moore, head of KPMG's venture-capital practice. These startups can now \"pick a perfect time to go public, as opposed to being at the mercy of having to go public when the cash was running out,\" he said. </p><p></p>",
