  "text": "<p>Morgan Stanley is increasing salaries for its junior investment bankers, making it the latest Wall Street bank to lift pay following complaints about the industry's gruelling working conditions. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley staff were told on Wednesday that first-year investment bank analysts would earn $100,000 per year with second-year analysts taking home $105,000, according to a person familiar with the matter. Previously, they earned $85,000 and $90,000, respectively. This does not include any bonuses, which are common in investment banking. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman last month became one of the leading <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ffd6033f-e8fc-4289-85b2-42bc4ddddd16\">advocates</a> for a return to the office, telling staff: “If you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office and we want you in the office.”</p> <p>The increase, which was first reported by Business Insider, brings Morgan Stanley <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fade91ab-df32-44ed-b63e-be2c6cd376cc\">in line</a> with the likes of JPMorgan, Citigroup and Barclays in salaries for junior investment bankers. Other banks like Credit Suisse and Jefferies have also offered younger staff perks like a one-time bonus and a Peloton. </p> <p>The move comes against a backdrop of booming deal activity as banks including Morgan Stanley benefit from advising on mergers and acquisitions amid a deluge of pandemic-driven deals. </p> <p>The activity has bolstered investment banks' profits but also resulted in longer hours for junior staff. This was highlighted earlier this year by a group of first-year investment banking analysts at Goldman Sachs who surveyed 13 analysts and found their average work week was 95 hours, with five hours of sleep a night.</p> <p>The move leaves Goldman Sachs as the last major holdout among large investment banks to not yet lift pay, a question the bank is currently <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/239631a3-c42d-4ce4-9dc5-1e3cc71ca0e9\">wrestling </a>with. </p> <p>A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on any plans the bank may have around pay. </p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin in New York 2021 'Morgan Stanley joins other Wall Street banks in lifting junior pay' FT.com 28 July.
