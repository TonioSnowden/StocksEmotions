  "title": "Banking & Finance: Testimony on 1MDB Case Is Challenged --- Former Goldman banker says star witness's testimony is inconsistent",
  "text": "<p>Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Mr. Ng, suggested Mr. Leissner's testimony didn't match what he previously told the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p><p>Prosecutors allege Mr. Ng, a former Goldman managing director, conspired with Malaysian financier Jho Low to bribe officials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates and to launder billions of dollars stolen from 1Malaysia Development Bhd., a state-controlled economic-development company known as 1MDB. Mr. Ng is the first defendant in the U.S. case to face a jury.</p><p>Mr. Leissner, a former Goldman partner, testified earlier in the trial that he participated in a 2012 meeting in London in which he, Messrs. Ng and Low and others discussed bribing government officials to secure lucrative business deals for Goldman Sachs.</p><p>At that meeting, Mr. Low drew a chart of all the government officials who needed to be bribed, Mr. Leissner told jurors.</p><p>Mr. Agnifilo challenged that account, citing FBI memos that indicated Mr. Leissner previously told investigators that Mr. Ng didn't attend the meeting.</p><p>Mr. Agnifilo also said Mr. Leissner never mentioned an alleged bribery chart until nearly three years into discussions with investigators.</p><p>Mr. Leissner said he didn't recall initially telling the FBI that Mr. Ng wasn't there and insisted that the defendant was in fact present at the meeting when bribery plans were discussed.</p><p>\"I don't remember when I first brought up the chart,\" Mr. Leissner said.</p><p>Through their work at Goldman, Messrs. Leissner and Ng helped raise $6.5 billion in bond offerings for 1MDB in 2012 and 2013. Much of that money was siphoned away, prosecutors say, through offshore shell companies. Mr. Low has been indicted but is still at large. Messrs. Leissner and Ng also hid from Goldman Mr. Low's role as a middleman in the deals, according to prosecutors.</p><p>The scandal was a black eye for the bank. It paid more than $5 billion in penalties to the U.S. and Malaysia and took away compensation from some top executives. It also admitted that a subsidiary broke U.S. corruption laws.</p><p>Mr. Leissner, who was arrested in 2018, said he met with federal investigators approximately 50 times over the course of more than three years. He has testified for several days so far.</p><p>His credibility is crucial to the prosecution, as Mr. Agnifilo has previously said Mr. Leissner is the only trial witness who implicates Mr. Ng with committing a crime.</p><p>During earlier testimony on Tuesday, Mr. Leissner conceded that, after he agreed to cooperate with federal investigators, he initially lied to them, falsely saying that his ex-wife and Mr. Ng were responsible for certain crimes that he in fact committed. \"You lied to the FBI knowing that people's fates lied in the balance?\" Mr. Agnifilo asked. \"At the time, I was trying to protect myself,\" Mr. Leissner said, adding that he later took responsibility and told the truth.</p>",
