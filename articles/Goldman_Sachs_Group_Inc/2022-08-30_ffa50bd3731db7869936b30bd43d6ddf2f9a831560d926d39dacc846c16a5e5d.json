  "title": "The housing recession will continue and eventually flatten house prices, Goldman Sachs economist says",
  "text": "<p>Mortgage rates as high as 5.8% — they were just 3.2% in January — are partly to blame. Sales and permits have fallen more sharply in regions where they increased the most in the earlier part of the pandemic, suggesting a retreat from the pandemic-related boost to housing, said Walker.</p><p>Walker says existing home sales will fall another 12% by the fourth quarter, and new home sales will be flat. The latest survey from the Conference Board says plans to buy a home within six months has dropped to the lowest level since 2015.</p><p>Even with demand on the way down, there's still a supply imbalance. There's a growing backlog of incomplete units that has pushed up the number of new homes available for sale, due to both supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages. And, per Zillow data, the reduction in demand has also been met by fewer owners putting their homes for sale.</p><p>House price growth on a quarterly basis will slow to 8.5% in the third quarter and 3% in the fourth quarter, which will take the year-over-year rate down to 14% by the end of the year. Next year, Walker says home price growth will stall completely.</p><p>The housing recession will continue and eventually flatten house prices, Goldman Sachs economist says</p>",
