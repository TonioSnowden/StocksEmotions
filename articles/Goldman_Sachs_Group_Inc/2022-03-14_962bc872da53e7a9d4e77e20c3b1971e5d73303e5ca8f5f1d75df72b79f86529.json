  "text": "<p>Citigroup is founding a hub for new investment bankers in the southern Spanish city of Malaga, as the Wall Street lender seeks to gain an edge in the fierce war for talent by offering younger employees a better work-life balance.</p> <p>The bank is recruiting 30 so-called “junior banking analysts” from universities around Europe for the new unit, hoping that Malaga's 320 days of sunshine a year and cheaper cost of living will attract a more diverse range of candidates, Manolo Falcó, global co-head of investment banking, told the Financial Times.</p> <p>In contrast to the brutal 95-hour weeks that have become typical in the sector and have led to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f5d2587-d9a7-4cd5-ac84-e36d75b13a24\">complaints about burnout</a>, the graduates will work a less arduous eight hours a day and have their weekends protected.</p> <p>They will be paid around half the $100,000 or more starting salary for first-year analysts in London or New York. That figure has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fade91ab-df32-44ed-b63e-be2c6cd376cc\">vastly inflated</a> in recent years as investment banks struggle to retain overworked young staff, particularly amid a dealmaking boom in the pandemic.</p> <p>“The message is clear: the key driver behind many junior departures is the search for a better work-life balance,” Falcó said. “At Citi, we are listening and to address this . . . an improved and better-balanced lifestyle will be a defining feature” of the new hub.</p> <p>Those in Malaga will be hired in addition to the roughly 100 investment banking and capital markets analysts Citi hires each year in the Emea region, spread across offices in London, Madrid, Paris, Milan and Frankfurt.</p> <p>After two years, those who have performed well will have the opportunity to apply for a full analyst role.</p> <p>Investment banks have been harshly criticised recently for overworking their most junior staff. Last year exhausted Goldman Sachs analysts circulated a slide deck detailing 15 hour days and workplace abuse, exacerbated by the isolation of homeworking during the pandemic.</p> <p>In response, almost all banks have significantly boosted salaries to $100,000 or more — with big bonuses on top — as well as offering perks like free Peloton exercise bikes, tablets and wireless headphones.</p> <p>Nacho Gutiérrez-Orrantia, Citi's Emea head of investment banking and capital markets, said the new hub was an attempt to “try something different”.&#xa0; </p> <p>“It is more about quality of life, in a place that is well-connected, with a welcoming business environment in an affordable city with strong ability to attract top talent,” he said. “It is a new entry point into the business.”</p> <p>Malaga has also attracted other multinational companies in recent years such as Google, which located a new cyber security centre there last year, and Vodafone, which is opening a new €225mn, 600 person <a href=\"https://www.vodafone.com/news/technology/european-research-development-centre\">R&amp;D hub</a>.</p><p>Source: Stephen Morris, Banking Editor 2022 'Citi hopes Malaga beaches can win over junior bankers' FT.com 14 March.
