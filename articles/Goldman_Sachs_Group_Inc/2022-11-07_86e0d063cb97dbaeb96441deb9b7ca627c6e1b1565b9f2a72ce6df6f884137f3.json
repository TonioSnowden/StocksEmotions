  "title": "S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2023 take 'complete U-turn' as recession risks loom, according to BofA; 'Forward estimates have been cut much larger than usual,' says BofA",
  "text": "<p>While the 2023 EPS consensus remains \"well above\" BofA's forecast of $200, estimates are 8% below the June peak of $252, according to the note. Revisions so far this year are \"now trending in line with the historical average,\" and if the 2.9x pace of cuts continues through year-end, the S&amp;P 500 could see \"no EPS growth next year\" as 2023 consensus would fall to around $220, the strategists warned.</p><p>The above chart shows how 2023 EPS revisions stack up against the historical average, while also considering exclusions of the COVID-19 crisis and 2008 global financial crisis.</p><p>\"Actual EPS historically came in 4% below where consensus stood in the beginning of the year, which also points to potential for negative growth,\" the strategists said.</p><p>Meanwhile, estimates for S&amp;P 500 EPS in the fourth quarter are down 4.3% since the beginning of October, or 2.5 times the typical estimate cut \"at this point in earnings season,\" they wrote.</p><p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group said in a research note Friday that they lowered their 2023 EPS growth forecast to 0%, from a previously expected increase of 3%, after the S&amp;P 500's net margins contracted in the third quarter for the first time since the pandemic on a year-over year basis. They wrote that \"weak\" third-quarter margins presage \"a headwind\" next year.</p><p>Goldman kept its price target for the S&amp;P 500 at year-end at 3,600 and also maintained its 2023 forecast of 4,000.</p><p>Equity risk premium</p><p>The BofA strategists said in their note Monday that they continue to expect that \"rising earnings risk will lead to a higher equity risk premium.\"</p><p>Their forecast for a 9% earnings drop in 2023 should translate into an increase in the equity risk premium of 100 basis points, according to the note. And that size increase translates into an S&amp;P 500 price of around 3,200 based on today's rates, they said, pointing to a 1.7% real yield for the 10-year Treasury note.</p><p>That valuation for the S&amp;P 500 is below current trading levels, as well as the index's 2022 closing low of 3,577.03 on Oct. 12, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has tumbled 20.9% this year through Friday.</p><p>The U.S. stock market was trading mostly higher early afternoon Monday, with the S&amp;P 500 SPX rising 0.2%, according to FactSet data, at last check. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, a blue-chip gauge of stocks, gained 0.7% in early afternoon trade, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP was about flat.</p><p>All three major stock benchmarks fell last week amid investor anxiety over aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve as it battles high inflation.</p><p>The BofA strategists expressed concern over \"looming recession risk\" and falling corporate sentiment. \"Mentions of weak demand have spiked to prior recession levels,\" they said in their note Monday.</p><p>S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2023 take 'complete U-turn' as recession risks loom, according to BofA</p>",
