  "text": "<p>Fried Frank, the US law firm, has poached a team of financial services lawyers from its rival Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft, as fierce competition for lawyers rages across the industry.</p> <p>Five partners are set to join New York-based Fried Frank from Cadwalader, with four of those starting immediately on Monday. Over the coming weeks 15 other lawyers and 15 business services professionals will join.</p> <p>The hefty talent shift highlights the strong competition that top Wall Street law firms are facing from rivals, largely driven by last year's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6dfdd78a-e229-4524-a400-144396524eb6\">record wave of dealmaking</a> activity which has pushed advisers' pay up across the industry.</p> <p>“We need to compete for talent not just on compensation,” David Greenwald, chair of Fried Frank, told the Financial Times. “When it comes to associates, we all pay the same thing. So we're competing on other things: quality of work and type of practice, exposure to clients.”</p> <p>Fried Frank, which focuses on private equity, mergers and acquisitions, and real estate work, has more than 500 lawyers worldwide. The new hires are set to particularly boost its structured products and broker-dealer regulatory practices.</p> <p>Last year's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4006248-eb05-49d2-a938-d70118c4ce1b\">M&amp;A frenzy</a> was propelled to record highs by the flood of private capital and led to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2a8467e-6b7c-4376-a496-7019fd8e2e83\">burnout</a> across the industry as lawyers worked ever longer hours to complete deals. Large US firms subsequently increased their bonuses to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29b3d982-041d-4452-83f3-bdcb47e3ed99\">record sums</a> — Fried Frank and Boies Schiller Flexner offered their lawyers between $15,000 and $115,000, depending on seniority.</p> <p>“We pay competitive compensation to everybody at the firm,” Greenwald said, adding that Fried Frank associates earn bonuses based on hours worked. “So if they work really hard, they can earn a 30 per cent premium above what the market rate bonus is,” he added.</p> <p>Greenwald engineered the poaching of Cadwalader's lawyers by first hiring his longtime associate Steven Lofchie, whom he first met when working at Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>Lofchie will begin at Fried Frank on Monday alongside partners Dorothy Mehta, Nihal Patel and Jason Schwartz. Ray Shirazi is set to join shortly after.</p> <p>Greenwald added that Shirazi's structured products experience, and Lofchie and Patel's experience in the broker-dealer world “will be tremendously additive”.</p> <p>“We're adding to and enhancing our financial services capabilities. The group brings with them some skills and expertise that we do not have already at a robust scale,” he said.</p> <p><em>This story has been amended to correct the dates when Jason Schwartz and Ray Shirazi will begin at Fried Frank</em></p><p>Source: Nikou Asgari in New York 2022 'Fried Frank poaches 35 legal staff from Cadwalader as talent tussle heats up' FT.com 28 February.
