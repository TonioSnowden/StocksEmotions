  "title": "Federal Reserve to Test Ability of Largest Banks to Weather Recession; Stress test will feature a scenario in which markets seize up and unemployment jumps to 10%",
  "text": "<p>In a \"severely adverse\" scenario, U.S. unemployment rises nearly 6 percentage points to a peak of 10% in the third quarter of next year, the Fed said. The large increase in the unemployment rate is accompanied by a 40% decline in commercial real-estate prices, widening corporate bond spreads, and a collapse in asset prices, including increased market volatility.</p><p>Designed to gauge the health of the nation's banking system, the stress tests assess whether a bank has sufficient capital to withstand a severe downtown and to make four quarters of planned shareholder dividends. If a bank misses that target, it faces automatic restrictions on dividends and buybacks unless it raises additional capital.</p><p>The biggest banks in the U.S.—a group that includes JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.—must do well on the tests to return money to shareholders. The banks have done well on the tests in recent years, though in 2020 the Fed temporarily capped dividends and barred buybacks, citing the need to conserve capital during the coronavirus-induced downturn.</p><p>Write to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com</p><p>Federal Reserve to Test Ability of Largest Banks to Weather Recession</p>",
