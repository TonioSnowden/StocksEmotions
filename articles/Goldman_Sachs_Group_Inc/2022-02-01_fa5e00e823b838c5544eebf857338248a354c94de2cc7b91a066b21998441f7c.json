  "text": "<p>The two companies were among dozens&#xa0;that announced in the days after the riot that they would pause or review their political donations, decisions that in some cases&#xa0;drew pushback from lawmakers.</p><p>At that time, Comcast CMCSA announced it would suspend donations to the election objectors. Goldman Sachs GS had said it would stop all political giving as it reviewed its donation criteria. At the time, Goldman Sachs planned to closely examine the records of those who tried to obstruct the results of the election, a person familiar with the matter said then.</p><p>Representatives for Comcast didn't respond to emails seeking comment. A representative for Goldman Sachs declined to comment.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal has previously reported that more than a dozen other corporate and industry PACs that paused all political giving or announced reviews&#xa0;had already restarted donations, including to objectors, earlier this year. In previous statements to the Journal, several of the companies said the PAC donations, which are funded by employee contributions, were necessary to help them accomplish their business goals.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Teachers are quitting, and companies are hot to hire them.</p><p>One million deaths: The hole the pandemic made in U.S. society.</p>",
