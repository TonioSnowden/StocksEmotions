  "text": "<p>   HONG KONG -- China's aggressive campaign to root out speculative real-estate activity could slow the country's growth rate for years to come, economists say, even if the worst-case scenario -- a major housing correction with sharply falling home prices -- is averted. </p><p>   China is attempting a controlled slowdown of the country's property market -- whose decadeslong boom has led to runaway price increases and a glut of empty apartments -- in an effort to reduce financial risks and put the economy on sounder footing. </p><p>   While economists generally agree that purging the market of irrational behavior is necessary, they say the campaign will at least partly deprive China of one of its biggest sources of growth. Chinese policy makers have signaled that they recognize there will be a trade-off for economic growth, but have shown no indication that they plan to scrap the regulations on developers and home buyers. </p><p>   Real-estate activity accounts for about one-fourth of gross domestic product in China and speculative behavior has supported employment and revenue-collection in cities for years. Without a booming property market, China is more likely to clock annual growth of around 3% to 5% in the next few years, economists say, instead of the more than 6% growth it has been accustomed to. </p><p>   \"A successful campaign to make housing more affordable will come at a cost, perhaps putting 5-6% growth out of reach durably,\" wrote economists from the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based global association of financial firms. The IIF projects China's GDP to expand by an average of 3% or lower each year from 2022 to 2031 as its economy matures, per capita incomes rise and real estate slows. </p><p>   That is lower than the average annual growth rate of 5% that China needs to maintain from now until 2025 to avoid the middle-income trap -- a phenomenon in which developing economies stall before people's incomes catch up to more advanced economies -- according to speeches earlier this year by Zhu Guangyao, China's former vice minister of finance. </p><p>   Real estate and other related industries contributed 24% of China's GDP in 2016, compared with 15% in the U.S., according to calculations by Oxford Economics. </p><p>   \"There is simply no other sector or industry that can fill up the gap if the property industry is no longer a growth driver,\" said Yao Wei, an economist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong. </p><p>   Chinese officials have long emphasized the need for more high-quality growth from domestic consumption, as opposed to wasteful investments in property and infrastructure. </p><p>   After years of fast-climbing home prices and rising debt, Chinese authorities imposed new rules during the past year meant to slow the market and limit how much developers can borrow to keep expanding. Those steps led to a sharp decline in sales and raised concerns about a possible severe housing downturn. </p><p>   Many analysts say Beijing has plenty of tools to contain the damage. Yet even a controlled drop in real-estate activity would affect many people. </p><p>   Private companies such as struggling developer China Evergrande Group employ hundreds of thousands of workers nationwide, while supporting construction firms and other contractors. Nearly 20% of China's 285 million migrant workers earned income from construction-related jobs in 2020, data from China's National Bureau of Statistics shows. </p><p>   Centaline Property, a major property agency in China with nearly 40,000 staff, plans to lay off about 1,000 agents in its Shanghai and Shenzhen offices as the market slows, said a person familiar with the matter. Centaline declined to comment. Agents at property firms say they are earning fewer commissions, which could affect spending. </p><p>   Local governments, which face limited options under Chinese regulations for raising revenue through taxes and borrowing, have become over-whelmingly dependent on land sales, which are expected to slow as the real-estate market cools. In 2020, land-sale revenues reached $1.3 trillion, equivalent to 84% of local-level fiscal revenue that year, up from 70% in 2019 and 37% in 2015, according to data provider Wind. </p><p>   If localities can't sell as much land in the future, it will limit their ability to invest in infrastructure, another growth engine for China, and repay their own rising debts. </p><p>   The total debt of local-government financing vehicles, a popular way for officials to obtain off-balance-sheet loans, reached about 52% of China's GDP by the end of 2020, according to calculations by Goldman Sachs. </p><p></p>",
