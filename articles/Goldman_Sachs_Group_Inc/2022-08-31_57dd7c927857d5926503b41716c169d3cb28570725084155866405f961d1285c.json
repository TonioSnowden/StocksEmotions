  "text": "<p>Good evening</p> <p>Another day, another “worse than expected” piece of data.</p> <p>Today's instalment was news that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63e3e26b-2c59-400b-8556-564cb21a706e\">eurozone inflation</a> had risen from 8.9 per cent to a new record of 9.1 per cent in August, heaping pressure on the European Central Bank to announce a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy next week.</p> <p>The data fuelled a further sell-off in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e8c3680-bf33-4b6c-a7c0-a1b613560f79\">European bond markets</a> as investors braced for bigger interest rate rises. Economists now predict inflation will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40cec809-3279-4066-add6-fbc31953e6c2\">top 10 per cent</a> this year and remain higher for longer than originally forecast.</p> <p>The spiralling cost of energy was the main driver of today's increase, but the core reading, which strips out this and other volatile items such as food, still rose a higher than expected 4.3 per cent, up from 4 per cent in July. On the plus side, wholesale energy prices have come down from record highs after news of an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/02f848fc-3b80-4ddc-ba4f-26109d79db89\">EU plan</a> to moderate electricity prices by separating them from the spiralling cost of gas.</p> <p>Inflation in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7ac09a84-0322-45c8-9167-3c24ddb06525\">Germany</a>, the eurozone's most important economy, hit a 40-year high of 8.8 per cent, despite government measures such as lowering duty on fuel and energy bills and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a9973cd-ea91-42a9-a79f-4a8c5bf93500\">subsidising train fares</a>. Bundesbank chief Joachim Nagel recently suggested <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c23d11f4-5aca-463f-9102-44269b289b1f\">double-digit levels were likely</a> this year, for the first time since 1951. </p> <p>Meanwhile in the UK, inflation could hit 13 per cent next month after a ruling from the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e12aa3c0-3af0-45c3-adc5-9f8802a1eab4\">Office for National Statistics</a> that a £400 rebate on household energy bills would not affect its calculation. Goldman Sachs yesterday trumped Citigroup's forecast of 18.6 per cent inflation in January, when energy prices are likely to ratchet up again, with a prediction of more than 20 per cent. </p> <p>Chief economics commentator Martin Wolf lays out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2ca227e-9fd2-4f47-8a35-18b176a864f0\">the challenge facing central bankers</a>, unable to address the core problem of the energy shock: how to ward off the “calamity” of 1970s-style high and unstable inflation without causing an unnecessarily deep slowdown.</p> <p>Today's data follow hawkish rhetoric on fighting inflation from central bankers gathered at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b71e259f-f2f0-4e25-bd22-0dbd0f344643\">Jackson Hole</a> in Wyoming last week. </p> <p>Hanging over the meeting, reports US economics editor Colby Smith, was the feeling that the world and the economic relationships that underpin it had fundamentally changed. Some believe that the forces that previously kept prices in check, such as globalisation and a plentiful supply of labour, have reversed.</p> <p>Or as ECB board member Isabel Schnabel puts it, we are at risk of transitioning from the past two decades of the “Great Moderation” to a new era: the Great Volatility.</p> <p><em>Compare international trends with our </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/088d3368-bb8b-4ff3-9df7-a7680d4d81b2\"><em>global inflation tracker</em></a><em>.</em></p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>US regulators clear updated <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94bf5271-56be-447a-b362-320ba0cb305d#post-87f79602-5b43-40a1-9ed2-e613cec6490d\">Covid boosters</a> targeting newest variants</p></li>  <li><p>UK set to confirm government 20% stake in new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16a0ab4d-64e2-4428-8dc3-8907c3306155\">Sizewell C nuclear plant</a></p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94bf5271-56be-447a-b362-320ba0cb305d#post-0be6880f-3798-4217-beca-9bc8153eeda6\">Canada's economy</a> grows slower than expected in the second quarter</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94bf5271-56be-447a-b362-320ba0cb305d\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>European fears over <strong>gas supplies</strong> intensified as Russia halted flows through the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ea4ecf5-6f85-463c-a9d2-026492656588\">Nord Stream 1</a> pipeline for three days of maintenance, while in <strong>Germany</strong> some companies have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d0d46712-6234-4d24-bbed-924a00dd0ca9\">halted production</a> as prices soar. <strong>Shell</strong> said Europe may have to get used to several years of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ed80178-0573-41a8-b437-49e3a293f6a9\">rationing</a>, but some relief is on the way from China, which is reselling its surplus <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e20467a-5b53-42b7-ad89-49808f7e1780\">liquefied natural gas</a>.</p> <h2>Latest for the UK and Europe</h2> <p>Only five more sleeps till the UK gets its new prime minister!

But looking at this<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da16c3a4-3466-4e25-b9f3-cd47ceb4f2ec\"> nightmarish in-tray</a> it's a wonder why anyone would want the job . . . </p> <p>Signs of the economic squeeze are coming thick and fast. UK <strong>credit card borrowing</strong> rose at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b69a30c0-d72d-4a19-95cd-acc7a18da1bd\">fastest rate in 17 years</a> last month as consumers battened down the hatches, while other data showed shoppers were increasingly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a54b7cb-355b-4af7-8c13-d67fc6649037\">trading down</a> to <strong>own-label groceries</strong>.</p> <p>Finding solace at your local boozer could also be problematic: leading <strong>pub chains</strong> say many face closure unless the government helps them with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4673f38-e520-4a23-9f51-afd3a7348901\">crippling energy bills</a>. <strong>Corner shops</strong> face the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/441f07fb-8c48-4b0b-bafe-75942f36bbff\">same problem</a>.

Social media group <strong>Snap</strong> announced a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/59134aaa-6ae2-4940-86ab-bf6e2fdc41bd\">20 per cent cut in staff</a> as advertising demand wanes. </p> <p>The head of <strong>CRH</strong>, the world's biggest building materials company, told the FT the industry faced a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56ad9174-a095-47b1-aeeb-44ffd6cecf68\">second wave</a>” of inflation as cost increases spread beyond energy to wages and raw materials.</p> <p>The darkening economic outlook is likely to wreck the appetite for travel this winter, leaving <strong>airlines</strong> facing a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a12baa14-70ad-4db1-9bf9-46fde9d99a20\">grim winter</a> on top of the disruption of recent months.
