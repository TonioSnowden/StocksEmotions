  "text": "<p>The Dow gained 0.2%, while the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite slipped less than 0.1%.</p><p>Shares of casino companies extended their slide after the Macau government set expectations for the future of the gambling industry there, including increased regulatory scrutiny over casino operations. Shares of Wynn Resorts dropped more than 8%, while Las Vegas Sands shares slid 3.6%.</p><p>Stocks have slipped in September, with some investors worried that markets are ripe for a pullback after marching higher for much of the year. Some have also voiced concern that the economic rebound wouldn't be as fast as they previously expected. The spread of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, an economic slowdown in China and supply-chain difficulties have all damped sentiment.</p><p>\"We've shifted from worrying about premature tightening [by the Federal Reserve] killing off the recovery in equities to concerns about the strength of the recovery weighing on equities,\" said Sebastian Mackay, multiasset fund manager at Invesco. Mr. Mackay remains upbeat about the outlook for stocks, but said he has taken out insurance against volatility by buying put options.</p><p>U.S. industrial production rose at a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in August compared with the previous month, according to Fed data released Wednesday. The reading broadly matched forecasts from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal, who expected a 0.5% rise. But factory output lost some momentum in August compared with July, when it rose by a revised 0.8%.</p><p>Oil prices extended a recent rally, driven in part by disruption to output caused by Hurricane Ida. Futures on Brent crude, the international energy benchmark, climbed 3.4% to $76.07 a barrel. More than 39% of oil output in the Gulf of Mexico and 48% of gas output was offline Tuesday, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said.</p><p>Energy was the best-performing sector of the S&amp;P 500, boosted by the oil rally. Chevron shares gained 1.7%, making it one of the best performers in the Dow.</p><p>Shares of specialty lender GreenSky surged 51% after Goldman Sachs agreed to acquire the company for $2.2 billion, as part of the bank's broader plan to reinvent itself as a Main Street plater. Goldman shares fell 1.6%.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.292% from 1.276% Tuesday. Yields and bond prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Overseas markets were mostly lower. The Stoxx Europe 600 dropped 0.7%. Stock indexes in mainland China and Hong Kong fell after data showed slowing growth across a range of Chinese economic indicators. An outbreak of Covid-19 and tighter property regulations hit consumer spending and the housing sector.</p><p>In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index shed 1.8%, with gambling and property companies among the biggest decliners in the market. Casino companies Sands China and Galaxy Entertainment dropped 33% and 20%.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>S&amp;P 500, Dow Edge Higher After Market Pullback</p>",
