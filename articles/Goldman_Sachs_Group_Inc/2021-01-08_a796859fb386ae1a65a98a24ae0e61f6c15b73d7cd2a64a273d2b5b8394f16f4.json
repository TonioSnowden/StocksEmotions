THE WARNER ESTATE IN LOS ANGELES</p><p>$165 MILLION</p><p>In many ways, Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos has been a key figure during the pandemic, as his company's stock price skyrocketed amid increased demand for online shopping. In April, he closed on a deal to buy the Warner Estate, the glamorous 1930s-era mansion designed for the late Warner Bros. president Jack Warner, from David Geffen for $165 million, setting a price record for a Los Angeles home. It was a direct, off-market deal with no agents involved, The Wall Street Journal reported.

Prosecutors said Woodbridge bought mansions, including the Owlwood estate, with cash from investors who thought they were investing on loans on properties, not buying them outright.
