  "title": "Fed Leaders Rosengren, Kaplan Announce Retirement Amid Trading Controversy; Eric Rosengren of the Boston Federal Reserve will retire Sept. 30, citing health reasons. He'll be followed into retirement by the Dallas Fed president.",
  "text": "<p>\"The Federal Reserve is approaching a critical point in our economic recovery as it deliberates the future path of monetary policy,\" Mr. Kaplan said in a statement that said he would retire from the bank on Oct. 8. \"Unfortunately, the recent focus on my financial disclosure risks becoming a distraction to the Federal Reserve's execution of that vital work,\" Mr. Kaplan said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mr. Rosengren, 64 years old, said in a statement released by the Boston Fed that he was leaving as he had qualified for a kidney transplant to deal with a long-running condition. The move accelerates the timing of Mr. Rosengren's mandatory retirement from the bank next year after 35 years of service at the institution. In most cases, regional Fed leaders must retire at 65, and Mr. Rosengren was due to leave the bank next June.</p><p>The trading activity of the two men alarmed some central bank watchers.</p><p>Recently disclosed information from the Boston Fed showed that Mr. Rosengren, who would have held a voting role on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee next year, had traded stocks and other investments related to the real-estate industry last year.</p><p>Disclosure forms for Mr. Kaplan showed many millions of dollars in trading in stocks and investments such as stock-market futures and interest-rate funds taking place since he became leader of the Dallas Fed in 2015. While central bank disclosure forms require officials to provide dates for trading, Mr. Kaplan's form referred to \"multiple\" dates and his bank has declined to provide any transaction dates. Mr. Kaplan has also turned down interview requests to speak about his trading.</p><p>Messrs. Rosengren and Kaplan said that while their trading was consistent with internal central bank rules, to avoid any conflicts of interest they would sell their stockholdings and move the money into cash or diversified mutual funds.</p><p>Mr. Kaplan said \"during my tenure, I have adhered to all Federal Reserve ethical standards and policies\" and added \"my securities investing activities and disclosures met Bank compliance rules and standards.\"</p><p>The Fed said recently that it would undergo a review of its ethics rules and make changes as needed.</p><p>The central bank nevertheless faced calls for the two men to step down. Critics say the trading raised questions whether the men were setting monetary policy with the nation's well-being in mind, or were acting for personal profit. While the regional Fed bank ethics rules prohibited ownership of bank stocks and limited senior leaders' trading around FOMC dates, they also called on central bankers to avoid even the whiff of impropriety with their investing activity.</p><p>After last week's FOMC meeting, Mr. Powell declined to voice clear support for the two Fed leaders. \"No one on the [FOMC] is happy to be—to be in this situation, to be having these questions raised. It's something we take very, very seriously,\" Mr. Powell said then.</p><p>In the Boston Fed statement announcing Mr. Rosengren's retirement, Mr. Powell said, \"Eric has distinguished himself time and again during more than three decades of dedicated public service in the Federal Reserve System.\"</p><p>The Dallas Fed statement said that Mr. Powell said Mr. Kaplan has been \"a passionate and forceful public voice on a wide range of issues, including the critical value of early childhood education and literacy.\" He added Mr. Kaplan \"strengthened the Bank's economic research and played a very constructive role in systemwide management, budget and technology efforts.\"</p><p>Over Mr. Rosengren's tenure at the Boston Fed, he became a leading voice on monetary-policy issues and on financial-stability issues, and helmed an institution that also oversaw key parts of the central bank response to the financial crisis over a decade ago and again when it faced down the coronavirus pandemic. The bank is currently researching the possible launch of a fully digital dollar as top central banks around the world contemplate adopting their own digital currencies to counter private rivals.</p><p>Mr. Kaplan, who worked for two decades and led investment-banking work at Goldman Sachs before leaving the bank in 2006, had been a strong voice on how monetary policy interacted with financial markets, and had worried recently that aggressive Fed aid to the economy may have been increasing risk to the financial system.</p><p>Mr. Rosengren \"has an unbelievably strong legacy in terms of the way he has led the Boston Fed,\" Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans told reporters Monday. \"I will miss him and his great counsel…but I certainly hope to enjoy continued long conversations with him well into the years after we're both retired,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Evans and New York Fed leader John Williams both expressed support for the central bank's ethics review that is aimed at ensuring the trading controversy isn't repeated.</p><p>\"We need to have the public's trust, we need to hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards,\" and the current review will help ensure that is the case, Mr. Williams said in a virtual appearance Monday. \"We stand ready to adopt any changes around financial rules of disclosure or anything like that\" because \"we need to make sure that people understand that we're working all the time in the interest of the public, and we need to have policies and restrictions to support that,\" he said.</p><p>The Boston Fed statement said Mr. Rosengren \"hopes to improve his health condition and eventually be able to explore areas of professional interest and contribution, in the future.\"</p><p>A search for Mr. Rosengren's successor is under way, the statement said. Given Mr. Rosengren's impending retirement, the bank noted that the process had already begun.</p><p>Write to Michael S. Derby at michael.derby@wsj.com</p>",
