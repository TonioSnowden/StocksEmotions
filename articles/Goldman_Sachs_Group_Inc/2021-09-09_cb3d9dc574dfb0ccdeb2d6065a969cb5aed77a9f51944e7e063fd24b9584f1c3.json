  "text": "<p><strong>EasyJet</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c2d5a82-c548-4f5a-aa06-3ad250855e72\">rejected a takeover approach</a> and confirmed plans to raise £1.2bn in a rights issue to take advantage of post-pandemic opportunities. </p> <p>The low-cost carrier said it had received an approach from a bidder it did not name. It said that the approach was “a low premium and highly conditional all-share transaction” which undervalued the company and that the bidder was no longer considering an offer.</p> <p>Alongside the rights issue, EasyJet said it had secured a new $400m revolving credit facility from its banks. It said that the proceeds of the equity issue would be used to strengthen its balance sheet, invest in growth opportunities in its core western European markets and bolster its easyJet Holidays business.</p> <p>EasyJet, which lost more than £2bn during the pandemic, still only expects to fly about 60 per cent of its 2019 schedule between July and September.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Wm Morrison</strong> said it expects to see food price inflation in the second half of its financial year but will look to mitigate these rather than pass them on to consumers. The supermarket chain cited the “sustained recent commodity price increases and freight inflation and the current shortage of HGV drivers” as contributing factors. It reported a profit before tax and exceptional items in the six months to August of £105m, lower by 37 per cent year on year because of £41m of Covid-related costs and £80m of foregone profit in fuel, in-store cafés and food-to-go. There was no interim dividend owing to the ongoing bid situation.</p> <p>Online gambling group <strong>888</strong> has confirmed it is to buy William Hill's international business from Caesars Entertainment via a reverse takeover, after the UK bookmaker was taken private in a £2.9bn transaction last year. </p> <p><strong>Computacenter</strong> said product shortages have resulted in orders being delayed into the second half of the year, restricting short-term profitability and pushing up inventory levels. The IT group said it expects this trend to continue for at least the rest of the year, combined with expected price increases. Computacenter posted a half-year adjusted pre-tax profit up 59.4 per cent to £118.9m on revenue up 29.2 per cent to £3.2bn.</p> <p><strong>Lloyd's of London</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5ec5553-fd36-4c37-a67e-b010f3411c48\">swung back to profit</a> in the first half as a stronger underwriting performance at the specialist insurance market marked a recovery from the substantial pandemic-related losses suffered last year. Aggregate pre-tax profit at Lloyd's, where underwriters agree deals with brokers to cover all manner of risks, was £1.4bn in the first half of 2021, compared with a £0.4bn loss in the same period last year.</p> <p><strong>Spire Healthcare</strong> said 2021 revenue will be “materially above” 2019 levels. Staff absence and late notice patient cancellations&#xa0;caused problems in July and August but trading should return to 2019 levels over the past four months of the year, assuming current Covid-19 prevalence does not rise materially, the hospital operator said. For the half year it reported a £4.7m profit, against a £231.3m loss a year ago. It booked £2.8m of merger and acquisition costs largely relating to the attempted takeover bid by Ramsay Health Care, which shareholders rejected in July.</p> <p><strong>Lookers</strong> said it will repay all Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme grants received this year and will resume dividends as soon as possible following “exceptionally strong” first-half trading. The car dealership group reported a £50.7m pre-tax profit for the period, against a £50.4m loss the year before, as underlying revenue grew 31.1 per cent to £2.2bn.</p> <p><strong>Speedy Hire</strong>, the tool and equipment hire group, said it has continued to benefit from the positive momentum experienced earlier in the year and is trading in line with the board's expectations.</p> <p><strong>Genus</strong>, the farmyard eugenicist, said first-half pre-tax profit rose 29 per cent to £84.8m on contract wins in China and a more profitable product mix towards royalties. Revenue was up 4 per cent to £574.3m. </p> <p><strong>Cenkos Securities</strong> posted a half-year pre-tax profit of £1.7m, up from £800,000 a year ago. The boutique broker said that, having completed two floats and eight further fundraisings since the end of the period, “we see reasons for optimism for the remainder of 2021 and beyond.”</p> <p>Subprime lender <strong>Morses Club</strong> said recent trading has matched expectations.</p> <p>Song royalties fund <strong>Round Hill Music</strong> said it had bought rights to the back catalogue of Dennis Elliott, the&#xa0;original drummer of the rock group Foreigner.</p> <p><strong>Gear4Music</strong>, the musical instrument retailer, said recent trading was in line with expectations though European revenue has been impacted by post-Brexit challenges.</p> <p><strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> is weighing whether to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4edfefb-4fba-46d9-bef3-2cfdba57bdb3\">mandate vaccines for employees</a> and fire those who refuse to comply, according to an internal memo sent to the oil supermajor's executive committee.</p> <p><strong>JD Sports Fashion</strong> is weighing an investment in Missguided, the online women's fashion retailer, <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/jd-sports-fashion-weighs-bid-to-swallow-online-retailer-missguided-12402410\">Sky News reported</a>. JD is among a number of parties in discussions with Missguided's founder Nitin Passi and the company's advisers, Sky said.</p> <h1>Job Moves</h1> <p><strong>Funding Circle</strong>, the peer-to-peer lender, named Lisa Jacobs as successor to Samir Desai as chief executive. Jacobs, currently managing director of Funding Circle's UK business, will take over in January when Desai becomes a non-executive director, the company said. Funding Circle also reported a half-year operating profit of £35.5m versus a £113.5m loss a year ago.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>Big-four accounting firm <strong>EY</strong> will invest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/737dd635-dba2-49d7-bcdd-34f467b218ea\">about $2bn</a> over the next three years to improve the quality of its audits as part of a record $10bn plan following scandals, including the collapse of German payments group Wirecard due to fraud last year.</p> <p><strong>Hedge funds</strong> are elbowing their way into Silicon Valley at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4935b205-8344-465a-8edf-dc23ec990302\">an&#xa0;unprecedented rate</a>, with a record $153bn worth of investments in private companies in the first six months of 2021. A report from Goldman Sachs has found that hedge funds have done 770 deals so far this year, beating the record number of deals set in the whole of 2020, when 753 deals reached a total of $96bn. </p> <p>Shares in <strong>Tencent</strong> and <strong>NetEase</strong> fell sharply after authorities ordered the Chinese technology companies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f724834b-53fb-4e1b-83d6-62150e3741f2\">to move away from a focus on profit</a> in online gaming. The country's two leading gaming companies were summoned for talks in Beijing, where top officials asked them to “profoundly understand the importance and urgency of preventing minors from online game addiction”, according to Xinhua, the state news service.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Malcolm Moore</strong> The mania for NFTs, digital collectible tokens, can be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ae22d81-4c23-4475-8661-354f1b8dbc7c\">seen as a land grab</a>. Supporters hope the ethereum blockchain that powers most NFTs will become the plumbing for the metaverse, an interoperable collection of mirror realities in cyber space. But no one knows how real world laws will interact with virtual worlds, nor what gives individual metaverse creators financial incentive to create a utopia of shared goods.</p> <p><strong>Bryce Elder</strong> Martin Sorrell's marketing services roll-up, S4 Capital, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e041334a-66eb-4d95-b545-7763e1a23fb4\">rapidly outgrowing its origin story</a> as a WPP clone built out of revenge. With the market value now approaching £4.5bn investors need to be alive to the corporate governance standards Sorrell is disregarding in the name of empire building.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'EasyJet launches £1.2bn cash call after rejecting approach' FT.com 9 September.
