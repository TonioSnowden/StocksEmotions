  "title": "Heard on the Street:  OPEC+  Maneuvering  Could  Backfire  ---  Reason for cut isn't as key  as how it is interpreted  ----  By Jinjoo Lee",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Who wins this energy war? Perhaps no one. </p><p>\n  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies on Wednesday agreed to cut their output limit by 2 million barrels a day. Because OPEC+ members have been producing below their official target levels for some time (3.4 million barrels per day below the official target in August), the number of actual barrels removed from the market will be smaller. Oil prices had been rising since Monday on speculation that OPEC+ would unveil production cuts. Brent crude rose on Wednesday 1.6% to $93.32 a barrel. </p><p>\n  The decision is notable not only because oil prices are high relative to historic levels but because market conditions remain very tight. Industry oil stockpiles in countries that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are 9.2% lower than the five-year average, according to the International Energy Agency's September report. While the oil cartel has often cut production in the face of weakening demand, it never implemented a cut in such a tight market, according to a Goldman Sachs research note from Monday. </p><p>\n  OPEC+'s rationale for the production cut will vary depending on who is answering the question. Theories range from political foul play -- that the group is acting as a conduit for Russia to inflict pain on the West -- to the group's own stated rationale, which involves innocuous concerns that a recession might cause oil demand to fall. Of course, besides the demand-side uncertainty, the big supply-side wild card is Russia. The European Union's import ban on Russian oil goes into effect in just two months' time, and it is anyone's guess how the Kremlin will respond to the Group of Seven's proposed price cap on its oil exports. </p><p>\n  What matters more isn't OPEC+'s actual intention, but that the West will interpret the move as an affront. The White House responded with a statement saying President Biden is \"disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impacts of Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\" </p><p>\n  In the near term, power tilts in the favor of OPEC+ because the West doesn't have effective countermeasures at their disposal. The U.S. is nearing the end of its historic release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and while the White House left the door open for more releases, further large draws would be risky given historically depleted levels. </p><p>\n  Offending the West in this way could backfire. The White House said Wednesday that OPEC+'s announcement is a reminder of why it is so important to wean off foreign fossil fuels, and reiterated its commitment to a clean-energy transition. That is the balancing act OPEC+ must perform going forward: Maximize oil revenue today, and the West will find ways to pivot more quickly away from oil. The 1973 oil embargo was a strong catalyst behind improving fuel-efficiency standards in the U.S., after all. </p><p>\n  It is a winning game for OPEC+ in the short term, but playing too aggressively is a surefire way to lose in the long run. </p><p></p>",
