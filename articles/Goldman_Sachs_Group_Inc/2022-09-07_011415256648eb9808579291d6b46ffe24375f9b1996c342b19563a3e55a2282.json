First came Russia, cutting off <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2624cc0f-57b9-4142-8bc1-4141833a73dd\">Nord Stream 1</a> supplies until western countries lift sanctions. Then came Opec+, whose modest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6cb316ae-3436-47ee-a1da-3867e2dee5d5\">oil output cut</a> sent a signal designed to remind consumers about who holds the power in energy markets these days. More on that in our first note. </p> <p>In Data Drill, Amanda looks at the stressors facing California's electricity network as a blistering heatwave hits America's west. </p> <p>And <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c73012d4-82af-4dca-b1e9-c91727414383\">don't miss this column</a> from my colleague in Chicago, Patti Waldmeir, on electric vehicles. Warning: EV fans, you may be triggered. But after all the dashboard lights began flashing on my beaten-up lemon of a car (142,000 miles, enjoyably rough suspension, and yours for a good price), I'm looking for a replacement — essential for my other job, ferrying teenage kids to sports and music around the tri-state area. And I agree with Patti's premise. For all the obvious reasons, I would love to go electric. But EVs are still way too expensive. Cars for the masses, they ain't. </p> <p><em>— Derek</em> </p> <h1>The price cap idea that could worsen the energy crisis</h1> <p>Energy markets are awash in risks right now, but one of the biggest comes from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1b570176-82ac-45fd-b9dc-96a05bacd8ae\">the price cap plan</a> promoted by Janet Yellen's Treasury Department and endorsed on Friday by the G7. </p> <p>The idea is to cut the Kremlin's oil income without cutting the flow of its oil to a tight global market. It is a colossal gamble and the plan could backfire. </p> <p>Although the headlines are all about cutting Russian petroleum income, the price cap's main intent is to make sure Europe's much stiffer sanctions — the ban on shipping insurance due to take effect in December — don't immediately wipe out Russian oil exports and trigger a price shock akin to that after the Iranian Revolution of 1978 to 1979. </p> <p>The message from the Biden administration is that sanctions must punish Russia, not consumers.</p> <p>But you will struggle to find a single oil market analyst outside the US government who thinks the price cap plan will work as intended. </p> <p>The G7 countries backing the plan have already either banned Russian oil or are preparing to. So it doesn't really affect them. But China and India, the Kremlin's two most important oil buyers, have not endorsed the plan. </p> <p>And why would China, a country in the midst of deep trade and geopolitical disputes with the US, or energy-thirsty India, agree to punish a reliable oil supplier whose war in Ukraine has barely drawn any complaint from Beijing or New Delhi? To secure cheaper oil, says the US. </p> <p>And even if these countries don't officially sign up, they can use the cap as a way to negotiate cheaper supplies, US officials say. </p> <p>Analysts also wonder how the US government will prevent — or track — extra payments for Russian oil above the price cap. This is a market in which even counting barrels moving around the US has become notoriously difficult. </p> <p>And breaking with Moscow will be difficult. The Kremlin has already said it will stop exports to countries co-operating with the ban — a huge threat for emerging economies that rely on its oil. </p> <p>The US government argues Moscow's threat to halt supply is idle. Russia lacks oil storage, so if it stopped selling its oil it would need to shut production, risking damage to some fields that are now decades old. Instead, Russia would act rationally and accept some capped oil income rather than none. </p> <p>But this is not a credible argument, given recent history. Two years ago, Russia slashed about 3mn barrels a day, or just under a third of its supply, as part of Opec+ cuts. Its fields seem to have coped. A similar drop in Russian supply now would send oil markets into a frenzy.</p> <p>Nothing about invading Ukraine or spending billions of dollars on a war that is depleting Russian resources and international standing, and drawn punitive economic sanctions, has been rational. </p> <p>And Russia has been weaponising energy for months. Within hours of the G7 price cap announcement, Russia shut Nord Stream 1 and said supplies to its most important market in Europe — a customer base on which its entire export industry has been based for decades — would be curtailed until western sanctions were removed. </p> <p>“The key risk to this policy is the potential for Russian retaliation, which would turn this into an additional bullish shock for the oil market,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent note.</p> <p>The moves would be “consistent with actions taken in the natural gas market”, Goldman said. </p> <p>Even if it doesn't hold back its own oil exports, Russia has already interfered with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7b4cc17-3258-43e5-ba3d-c006f5843f0d\">Kazakh</a> supplies. As one of the P5+1 countries, it could throw sand in the gears of any Iran deal. It may just nudge Saudi Arabia and other Opec+ allies — who are already unimpressed by the Biden administration's efforts to lower oil prices and their oil revenue — into further <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6cb316ae-3436-47ee-a1da-3867e2dee5d5\">cuts</a> in supply. It could also disrupt supply in other oil producing countries, wrote Helima Croft, a former CIA analyst and head of Global Commodity Research at RBC Capital Markets. </p> <p>“Libya, Iraq, and Venezuela are all seen as providing fertile ground for Russia's asymmetric, disruptive capabilities” as Vladimir Putin could “escalate his energy war to sow division . . . in the western alliance and trigger a popular backlash against military assistance for Ukraine,” she wrote. </p> <p>There is much at stake. If it works, the price cap will change energy markets and the balance of power between producers and consumers — with implications lasting long after the Ukraine war ends. It will be a significant defeat for the Kremlin. But it is a colossal gamble, relying not just on China, India and others co-operating, but also on Putin agreeing to sell oil at a price dictated by Washington. <em>(Derek Brower) </em></p> <h1>Data Drill</h1> <p>California's power grid faced its biggest test so far yesterday as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/370bf602-7a62-4f31-a23d-aa62bb94e91a\">a historic heatwave intensified</a> throughout the state. The state narrowly avoided outages last evening after peak load reached 52,061 megawatts, the highest demand ever recorded in the state, according to the California Independent System Operator. </p> <p>“We know it's been a long haul, and it's about to get even more difficult,” said CAISO president Elliot Mainzer at a press conference on Monday, urging California residents to use “every tool available” to conserve energy during peak hours. </p> <p>CAISO declared a stage three emergency alert yesterday evening, the last level before utilities are ordered to begin outages. The state operator has issued conservation calls for the past seven days to reduce strain on the grid. </p> <p>Cuts to energy use have trimmed as much as 1,000MW from forecasted demand in recent days, according to CAISO. The operator said escalating heat on Monday and Tuesday would require two to three times as much conservation to avoid outages. CAISO last cut power due to extreme heat in 2020, the first time in 20 years. </p> <p>Temperatures as high as 115F (46C) are expected to persist in California until Friday. More than 30 temperature records have been broken throughout the state in the past week, according to the Weather Prediction Center. Tuesday temperatures in downtown Sacramento reached 116F (47C), an all-time high.</p> <p>Scorching temperatures and dry conditions have also increased risk for wildfires. On Monday, CalFire reported it was responding to 14 large wildfires across the state. <em>(Amanda Chu)</em></p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11115161.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <h1>Power Points</h1> <ul>  <li><p>India's Silicon Valley <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8881c266-f2d4-4380-99f1-cb9f98e61a8c\">faces a “wake-up call”</a> after extreme flooding exposed infrastructure deficiencies. </p></li>  <li><p>Flush with cash, US oil and gas producers are embarking on a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4c5073e-a366-4c79-b33d-00262a538d80\">number of new deals</a>, prompting investors to rethink sector valuations. </p></li>  <li><p>Opinion: IEA director Fatih Birol argues Russia is neither <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c133867-7a89-44d0-9594-cab919492777\">winning the energy battle</a> nor disrupting the transition to clean energy.</p></li>  <li><p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/photography/interactive/2022/lithium-mining-electric-cars-chile/?itid=sf_business\">Saudi Arabia of the electric vehicle industry</a>, Chile's Atacama Desert, is paying high environmental costs to supply the world's lithium.
