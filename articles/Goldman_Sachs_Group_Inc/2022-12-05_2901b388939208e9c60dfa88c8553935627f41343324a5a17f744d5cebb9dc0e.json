  "title": "China begins to loosen COVID rules; Biden considers scrapping the military's vaccine mandate, and there's new data about Paxlovid rebounds",
  "text": "<p>More than 20 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, eliminated rules requiring a negative test to use public transportation, according to CNN. In addition, some residents are now allowed to quarantine at home, rather than have to go to a quarantine center. Expect more restrictions to be eased, as soon as Wednesday, reports Reuters.</p><p>This may not mean that the country's zero-COVID policy is over, however. \"Rather, we see them as clear evidence of the Chinese government preparing for an exit, and trying to minimize the economic and social cost of Covid control in the meantime,\" Goldman Sachs economists wrote in a research note on Sunday, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>6 things to know about COVID today:</p><p>* Young children may soon get access to an updated COVID shot. Pfizer PFE and BioNTech BNTX on Monday asked the Food and Drug Administration to authorizetheir updated COVID-19 vaccine as the third dose for children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years old. Children in this age group receive three doses as their primary series of shots. If the FDA authorizes the new request, children in this age group would receive two of the original shots, and the third shot would be the bivalent dose, which equally targets the original strain of the virus and the BA.4/BA.5 variants.</p><p>* Is the military's vax mandate on the way out? The Biden administration is considering scrapping the COVID vaccine mandate for the military, according to Reuters, while Politico reported that legislation that would get rid of the requirement could be revealed early this week.</p><p>* The dreaded Paxlovid rebound may be less common than you think. Researchers had thought as many as 30% of patients who took Pfizer's antiviral to treat a COVID infection rebound, but a new study found 18.9% of those taking Paxlovid reported a rebound in symptoms, compared with 7% who didn't take the drug, according to Bloomberg.</p><p>* Guess again if you don't think you've had COVID. About 42% of adults in the U.S. had antibodies that indicate a previous infection, but 655 people in that group, or 44%, said they've never had COVID, according to a new study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is likely due to asymptomatic infections.</p><p>* COVID cases in the U.S. are up 28% over the past two weeks. The daily average of new COVID infections in the was about 51,000, as of Sunday, according to a New York Times tracker, while the number of people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 has also increased by 28% over the last 14 days. COVID-19 deaths are declining, though 250 have died, on average, each day over the last seven days.</p><p>China begins to loosen COVID rules</p>",
