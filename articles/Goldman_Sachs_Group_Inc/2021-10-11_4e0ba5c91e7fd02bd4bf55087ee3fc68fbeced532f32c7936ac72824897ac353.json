The economists added that the downgrades are mostly offset by upgrades to 2023 and 2024 forecasts,</p><p>The researchers cited “a longer-lasting virus drag on virus-sensitive consumer services spending” and expectations that the global supply of semiconductors will not improve until next year, along with a likely decrease in fiscal stimulus.</p><p>They also expect some spending on services and non-durable goods to remain below pre-pandemic levels into next year, especially if the shift to remote work reduces overall spending.</p>",
