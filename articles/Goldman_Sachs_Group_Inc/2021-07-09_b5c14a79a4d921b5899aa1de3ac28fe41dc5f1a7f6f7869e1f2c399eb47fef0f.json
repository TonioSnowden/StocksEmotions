  "title": "Business News: Instacart Appoints a Veteran Of Facebook as Its New CEO",
  "text": "<p>\"I can't think of a better leader to take the company public\" and be at the helm, said Apoorva Mehta, co-founder and CEO of Instacart, who will become executive chairman of the board next month.</p><p>San Francisco-based Instacart has been among the biggest beneficiaries as Covid-19 concerns and restrictions reordered the U.S. business world. The company, which deploys shoppers to pick up groceries from supermarkets and deliver them to customers, got a boost as more consumers shifted their shopping online in the pandemic. Instacart also works with manufacturers to offer discounts on its platform and builds websites and mobile applications for retailers.</p><p>Ms. Simo joins Instacart as the company and other delivery providers face new challenges after a banner year of growth. More people are buying groceries online today than they did before the pandemic but companies are still struggling to turn a profit. Labor and transportation costs continue to eat into profit margins. Competition is intensifying, too, as rival food-delivery companies pitch favorable deals.</p><p>Instacart's market share of grocery delivery sat in the high 20% range before the pandemic and jumped to as high as 54% last year, according to Bloomberg Second Measure LLC. It has since fallen to 45%.</p><p>Mr. Mehta started Instacart in 2012 and said he hadn't considered whether someone else could run the company until he met Ms. Simo. When Ms. Simo hinted a couple months ago that she would be open to considering a role outside of Facebook, he showed up at her house in Carmel Valley, Calif., and said he wanted a chance to work with her.</p><p>\"We share the same ambitious vision for what Instacart can be,\" Mr. Mehta said. He declined to comment on Instacart's timing for an initial public offering.</p><p>Ms. Simo said she sees opportunities for Instacart to offer personalized options to shoppers, provide more technology to retailers and expand internationally. Instacart's advertising business has been growing quickly, which will allow Instacart to reinvest in its business and make services cheaper for retailers and customers as competition increases, she added.</p><p>\"Competition is nothing new to Instacart,\" said Ms. Simo, 35 years old.</p><p>Instacart added more than 200 retailers last year and now delivers from more than 600 businesses. It raised nearly $700 million of new capital over the past year, increasing its valuation to $39 billion.</p><p>The company also is beefing up its leadership team, hiring a chief financial officer from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and a chief operating officer from Facebook, among other roles.</p>",
