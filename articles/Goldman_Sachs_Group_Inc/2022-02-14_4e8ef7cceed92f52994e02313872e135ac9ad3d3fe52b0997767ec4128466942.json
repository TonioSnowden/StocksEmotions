  "text": "<p>Good evening,</p> <p>Political tensions over <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/ukraine-conflict\">Ukraine</a> have shone a spotlight on global energy supplies, but surging demand and supply shortages are affecting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4766d00-75ee-4382-9373-f326c89630e1\">stockpiles</a> of a range of other commodities, from industrial metals to food.</p> <p>The price of crude oil, which today hit a seven-year high of $96.16, is likely to stay elevated, the International Energy Agency said last week, unless producers make more of an effort to <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-february-2022\">turn on the taps</a>. The increases are showing up in record prices on the forecourt: the average cost of a litre of petrol in the UK hit <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60375568\">148p per litre</a> at the weekend, while diesel reached 151.57p last Thursday.</p> <p>Gas prices are also being driven up by the situation in Ukraine and lower flows from Russia, with Europe's storage facilities only a third full. Natural gas contracts for next-month delivery jumped 12 per cent today to €83.41 per megawatt hour.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88fca996-6447-464a-b25d-9fb76a4fc42f\">Sanctions against Russia</a> could have a dramatic effect on wider commodities markets that are already depleted by the bounceback in demand and myriad supply chain problems, leaving them highly vulnerable to disruption.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4766d00-75ee-4382-9373-f326c89630e1\">commodities and raw materials crunch</a> is particularly pronounced in metals markets, with traders paying large premiums for immediate supplies. “This is the most extreme inventory environment,” said one analyst at&#xa0;Goldman Sachs. “It's a completely unprecedented episode. There is no supply response.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Major exchanges have less than one week's supply of copper stocks, while supplies of aluminium — the price of which hit a 13-year high last week — are also low, as smelters in Europe and China cut capacity because of surging energy prices. Demand for lithium, dubbed the new “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/359d5287-d0ab-46ae-9c6b-09517ec9fb0c\">white gold</a>” because of its use in batteries for electric cars, is also racing ahead of supply.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6430685f-2754-4e76-a940-eaad4e32bcdb\">Paper shortages</a>, exacerbated by strikes at mills in Finland, are affecting companies from newspapers to financial groups that need to print millions of shareholder documents. “You've got paper prices spiking and everyone chasing too few tonnes,” said one consultant. “It's an absolute mess.”</p> <p>Reserves of arabica coffee beans are at their lowest level on the ICE futures exchange in more than 20 years, with the possibility of an “uncontrolled price spike”, according to one analyst. </p> <p>Rising input costs for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f204da6a-d431-4109-816d-9b697ff24894\">consumer companies</a> have been a recurrent theme in the current US earnings season, leading to price rises everywhere from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebf4f757-89e7-4680-b1e4-e3aa25985e11#post-f81c0a18-1054-4025-b123-b08565ff289c\">PepsiCo</a> to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70c96cdb-35da-4735-9153-63ebb1a400e8\">Unilever</a>, alongside increased labour and shipping costs and other supply chain problems.</p> <p>The end result, according to one strategist, is that “US businesses have managed to do something never before accomplished, which is to lump four years' worth of price increases into one”. </p> <h1>Latest news</h1> <ul>  <li><p>UK banking group <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/natwest-england-cardiff-city-rbs-wales-b982486.html\">NatWest</a> said it would close 32 branches as customers opted to move online (Evening Standard)</p></li>  <li><p>Federal Reserve policymaker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1493222591829618696\">James Bullard</a> said he was worried the US central bank was not moving fast enough to contain inflation (CNBC)</p></li>  <li><p>Outdoor grill maker Weber said it would raise prices for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/292e9162-162e-43d4-a23d-d4941d7c7f50#post-c47bb41c-92cd-430d-94f6-16c4ff05c658\">second time in six months</a>, as it faces rising costs and supply chain constraints</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For up-to-the-minute news updates, visit our&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/292e9162-162e-43d4-a23d-d4941d7c7f50\"><em>live blog</em></a></p> <h1>Need to know: the economy</h1> <p>The US government is busy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04fdb4c8-ff25-42c0-a21a-05a76594e6e6\">rewriting public health guidance</a> to herald the end of the “<strong>full-blown</strong>” pandemic, although some experts fear that polling data on this year's midterm elections might be driving the changes rather than public health.</p> <p>Slower growth and higher inflation will characterise the <strong>post-Covid world</strong> <strong>economy</strong>, writes contributing editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6c6f4e5d-8db9-435c-aa43-505fdcd538a4\">Ruchir Sharma</a>. The 2021 bounceback only looked good because so many countries had shrunk the year before.
