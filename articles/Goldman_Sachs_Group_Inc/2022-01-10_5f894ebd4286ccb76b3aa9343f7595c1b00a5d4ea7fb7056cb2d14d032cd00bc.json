  "text": "<p>At last check, the Nasdaq CompositeCOMP was down 2.3% , or 347 points, to reach 14,587. The index needs to stay above 14,451.69 to avoid a correction from its Nov. 19 record close peak. A correction is commonly defined by market technicians as a 10% fall from a recent peak.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite last week posted its&#xa0;biggest one-week percentage decline&#xa0;since February, as rising bond yields&#xa0;punctured tech valuations.</p><p>On Monday, the 10-year Treasury note BX:TMUBMUSD10Y yielded around 1.8%, adding to highs not seen since January of 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Yields move opposite to price.</p><p>Yields have been rising as investors anticipate tighter policy from the Federal Reserve and as many as three interest-rate increases in 2022 starting possibly in March. Goldman Sachs analysts, in a recent research note, estimate that there could be as many as four interest rate hikes this year.</p><p>Higher rates translate into higher power costs and can weigh substantially on rate-sensitive sectors for the market like tech and growth-oriented assets?</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite last entered correction on March 8 and didn't exit correction until April 9.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, meanwhile, was down 500 points, or 1.4%, while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX was off 1.8% in Monday's trade.</p>",
