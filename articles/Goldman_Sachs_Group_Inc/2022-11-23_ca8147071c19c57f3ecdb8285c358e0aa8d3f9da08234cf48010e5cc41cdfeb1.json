  "text": "<p>\"We're going to see the debate and the discussions around the two-step process, in other words, the importance of slowing the pace of rate hikes, but also not appearing to have declared victory on inflation,\" Donabedian said. \"There were certainly discussions about the appropriateness of slowing the size of the rate hikes, but also the appropriateness of remaining firm in that terminal rate.

The Minneapolis Fed's Neel Kashkarialso said that he wants to be sure inflation has stopped climbing before he would support stopping interest rate hikes.</p><p>If stock-market investors have been paying attention, the minutes shouldn't deliver a significant market shock tomorrow, Kramer wrote in a Monday note. But the problem is that, while bond and currency markets reacted and stopped falling last Thursday, the equity market was too focused on options expiration to pay attention to hawkish Fed officials, he said.</p><p>Read: This isn't a 'close your eyes and buy anything' kind of market</p><p>Traders widely expect the Fed to raise rates by 50 basis points in December, with some still betting on a 24% chance of a 75 basis points hike, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.</p><p>What stock-market investors will be looking for in the Fed minutes</p>",
