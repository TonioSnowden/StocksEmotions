  "text": "<p>Stocks have swung in recent days, buffeted by shifts in views about the strength of the economy and the likely path for central banks and interest rates. A big concern is that central banks could act too aggressively as they combat inflation and trigger a slowdown in economic growth, or even a recession. On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia lifted its key policy rate by 0.5 percentage point, more than expected.</p><p>\"We're still in this constant push and pull about where inflation is going to be, where growth is going to be, and whether we're going to be in a recession or not,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros.</p><p>\"The Australian central bank's move, it's a reminder that central banks can surprise on the upside. What does this tell us about what the Fed will do, what the ECB will do?,\" Mr. Kamal said. \"More aggressive tightening directly equals a higher probability of a recession.\"</p><p>Investors were awaiting more data on the state of the economy. The trade gap in the U.S. in April is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. ET and economists are forecasting it will narrow after reaching a record deficit the previous month. A key release this week is the consumer-price index on Friday, which will be closely watched for signals on whether inflation is weakening or not.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed to 3.060%, the highest level in nearly a month, before easing to 3.031%, compared with 3.037% on Monday. Yields rise when prices fall.</p><p>\"With yields at 3%, it shows that the market hasn't decided if we're going to have a recession or if we have one, how severe it's going to be,\" said Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank. \"That is what you would want to own if you expect a recession.\"</p><p>Oil prices climbed. Global benchmark Brent crude added 0.6% to trade at $120.15 a barrel. A global surplus of crude oil is ending as demand from China recovers due to lockdown restrictions easing, analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note. They forecast Brent will reach $135 a barrel in the second half of the year.</p><p>Food products manufacturer J.M. Smucker and arcade company Dave &amp; Buster's Entertainment are scheduled to post earnings on Tuesday ahead of the opening bell. Casey's General Stores is slated to report after markets close.</p><p>In premarket trading, Kohl's jumped more than 13% after The Wall Street Journal reported the department-store chain is in exclusive talks to be sold to retail holding company Franchise Group. The deal may value the company at around $8 billion.</p><p>Twitter declined 0.8%, extending Monday's slide after Elon Musk threatened to end his acquisition of the social-media platform, saying the company didn't comply with requests for data about spam accounts.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 slipped 0.3%.</p><p>In Asia, major benchmarks were mixed. The Shanghai Composite Index added 0.2%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 0.4%. Japan's Nikkei 225 edged up 0.1%.</p><p>The Japanese yen weakened 0.6%, reaching the lowest level against the dollar since April 2002. The yen has sold off this year as the Bank of Japan has remained committed to ultra-easy monetary policy, while many other central banks have begun lifting interest rates to combat rapid inflation.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies fell, with bitcoin tumbling 6% and dropping below $30,000. Ether declined 5%.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Slip Ahead of Economic Data</p>",
