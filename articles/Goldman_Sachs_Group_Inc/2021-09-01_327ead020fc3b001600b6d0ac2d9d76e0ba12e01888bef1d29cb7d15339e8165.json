  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start: </strong>UK hedge fund manager Chris Hohn has demanded that Canadian National abandon its $34bn pursuit of Kansas City Southern and replace CN's chair and chief executive with Jim Vena, after the US railroad regulator rejected the way the transaction was structured as it held the potential to harm the public interest, DD's James Fontanella-Khan <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/5e4b10ce-5769-4206-a6e0-dfb3cbb3a357?\">reports</a>.</p> <h2>‘Africa's SoftBank' bets big on India's tech scene</h2> <p>South African publisher-turned-internet-group <strong>Naspers </strong>struck it big in 2001 with a bet on an obscure Chinese start-up.&#xa0;</p> <p>Two decades and hundreds of billions of dollars of market value later, the group coined <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47b1a8fa-a7a3-11e9-b6ee-3cdf3174eb89\">“Africa's SoftBank”</a> is more than happy to hold on to its stake of nearly 29 per cent in<strong> Tencent</strong>. The holdings, now housed in Naspers' Dutch investment vehicle <strong>Prosus</strong>, made the Amsterdam-listed investment group Europe's biggest consumer internet company.</p> <p>But the company also sees the future of the internet in India as much as in China, and is willing to pay up for it — as shown by Tuesday's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8170ccb1-686c-44b3-b15b-d0feab3c4f17\">$4.7bn deal</a> for Prosus to buy India's <strong>BillDesk</strong>, one of the biggest deals so far in one of the world's fastest-growing online payment markets.&#xa0;</p> <p>The all-cash deal for the payment gateway is outsized even compared to the $6bn that Naspers and Prosus had already invested in India since 2005, from food delivery to payments under the group's own<strong> PayU </strong>business.</p> <p>Merged with Mumbai-based BillDesk, PayU will be a big global payments player with annual volumes of about $147bn.</p> <p>“We're really comfortable that we're paying a fair price here,” said <strong>Bob van Dijk</strong>, chief executive of Naspers and Prosus, adding that BillDesk was “standalone, already a tremendously attractive business” alongside the “explosive growth that we expect from this market”.</p> <p>As Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c1c078c-1d97-4532-a8e8-98d20795ac78\">points out</a>, Prosus has a lot to gain from the deal. The Amsterdam-listed investment vehicle that historically used to house Naspers' international internet assets will evolve into a consolidator capable of building out new lines of business.</p> <p>By combining BillDesk with its existing PayU fintech capabilities, Prosus can create a <strong>Stripe</strong>-like digital payments behemoth, drawing both merchants and consumers to its platform.</p> <p>The acquisition is also a signal of bigger deals to come from Naspers/Prosus, which has lost some landmark M&amp;A battles in the past despite its armoury of Tencent cash, including a 2019 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3938b42e-33b9-11ea-a329-0bcf87a328f2\">bidding war</a> with <strong>Takeaway.com</strong> for <strong>Just Eat</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The group is likely eyeing more investments in the subcontinent's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f6b35707-e7c5-4d30-8d11-5b8146183ca5\">explosive start-up scene</a>, after it bought a stake in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03936ef6-1525-43f1-ae45-009610d53a12\"><strong>Swiggy</strong></a>, India's biggest food delivery company, which raised $1.25bn from investors in July.</p> <p>Another sign came in June, when <strong>Ervin Tu</strong>, a former <strong>SoftBank </strong>Vision Fund managing partner and <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> alum, was appointed chief of investments, strategy and M&amp;A for Naspers/Prosus.&#xa0;</p> <p>The deal for BillDesk was in the works well before Tu arrived in August. But considering the $14.5bn that Naspers raised from its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd84b50c-219d-45c1-b734-a0becdd5c9a1\">last sale</a> of Tencent shares in April, we doubt it'll be long before another deal presents itself.</p> <h2>The failed megamerger that triggered ‘oligopoly' debate</h2> <p>A curious outcome of the failed attempt to merge insurance brokers<strong> Aon</strong> and <strong>Willis Towers Watson </strong>is that the sector has ended up a little more evenly spread than it was before.&#xa0;</p> <p>The $30bn deal aiming to unseat <strong>Marsh McLennan</strong> as the world's biggest insurance broker — firms that source insurance plans for other companies — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6471af0-764d-49e7-87a0-dd2a2c110fd9\">collapsed</a> in July. Fourth-placed <strong>Gallagher </strong>walked away from the wreckage with a revised agreement to buy most of Willis's reinsurance broking business. That bolsters its place in the revenue table.</p> <p>The US Department of Justice's June<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d03e1302-4091-4b11-a590-1c65358f0ab4\"> move</a> against the deal came as a relief for insurance companies worried about the power that has accrued to the biggest brokerage houses after many years of consolidation, as the FT's Ian Smith <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/2921514c-9fb5-4082-8780-cde316619e4f?\">explains in his latest piece</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>One senior Aon broker was quoted in the DoJ's complaint saying that the company was part of “an oligopoly which not everyone understands”. Asked whether that was true, Aon's chief <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d5160ee-a675-4fa7-9ce9-de5a9ec8e198\"><strong>Greg Case</strong></a> told the FT last month it operated in a competitive market characterised by low barriers to entry, multiple new entrants and high levels of private equity investment. </p> <p>Underwriters feared that a shift to a “Big Two” (as the DoJ put it) in critical markets would mean higher commissions, and leave them in a weaker position if insurance prices turned south. </p> <p>For dealmaking, the episode is being seen as a higher watermark. The regulatory logic would suggest that if Aon could not buy Willis, Marsh would be similarly prevented.<strong> Patrick Gallagher</strong>, Gallagher's chief executive, told the FT that he felt consolidation among any of the top four was now out of the question.</p> <p>But M&amp;A in the sector is far from over. Consolidation lower down the ladder would continue apace, Gallagher said, creating opportunities for the biggest companies to pick off midsized players. Case said in August that the company continued to have a “strong pipeline” of deals, highlighting smaller acquisitions made in recent years.</p> <p>And if the biggest brokers continue to get bigger, that will also further encourage consolidation among carriers, one insurer's chief executive told the FT. “It will be much harder for smaller insurers to deal with those people,” he said.</p> <h2>Vaccine requirements muddle the magic circle</h2> <p>This month, staff of US law firm<strong> Morrison &amp; Foerster </strong>will need to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 before returning to its London office. Those not fully vaccinated will continue to work remotely.</p> <p>The policy itself is hardly novel — an assortment of the firm's peers in the US including<strong> Debevoise &amp; Plimpton</strong>, <strong>Norton Rose Fulbright</strong> and <strong>Reed Smith</strong> have all adopted similar policies. <strong>Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell </strong>has gone as far as to deactivate the office ID cards of unvaccinated employees, according to reports by <a href=\"https://www.law.com/americanlawyer/2021/08/02/the-unvaccinated-at-davis-polk-face-deactivated-building-passes-come-september/\">Law.com</a>.</p> <p>It is, however, the first policy of its kind by a leading law firm in the UK, where companies must dance around the country's Equality Act to avoid getting sued for discrimination.</p> <p>“Magic circle” firm<strong> Clifford Chance</strong>, for example, hasn't implemented the same mandatory vaccine policy it <a href=\"https://abovethelaw.com/2021/07/elite-firm-will-require-vaccination-but-other-reopening-policies-are-very-flexible/\">imposes</a> in the US, instead bringing employees back on a hybrid basis of 50 per cent working hours — no vaccine proof necessary.</p> <p>As <strong>Kingsley Napley </strong>employment partner <strong>Richard Fox</strong> put it to <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/93352268-cbb5-401d-a8d7-fcbb36587e1d?\">the FT's Kate Beioley</a>: “Cautious employment lawyers would always say it's dangerous to introduce a mandatory vaccine policy [in the UK] because you could get people with discrimination claims and you could be vulnerable, so generally the word we use with our clients is encourage, don't compel.”</p> <p>One London managing partner of a US law firm said that he had received legal advice that it would be “unlawful to insist on people being vaccinated as a condition of a return to work”.</p> <p>UK-based firms including <strong>Linklaters </strong>and<strong> Slaughter and May</strong> seem to have received similar advice, and will not require staff to be vaccinated when they return to the office, according to individuals at the firms.</p> <p>Until the UK comes up with its own version of a recent US <strong>Department of Justice </strong><a href=\"http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/07/26/dojvax.pdf\">opinion</a> determining that federal law doesn't prevent employers from setting vaccine requirements, London's elite law firms aren't likely to break with the status quo.</p> <p>Morrison &amp; Foerster, it seems, is confident in its representation.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Advent International </strong>has hired <strong>Xavier Garambois</strong> as an operating partner.
