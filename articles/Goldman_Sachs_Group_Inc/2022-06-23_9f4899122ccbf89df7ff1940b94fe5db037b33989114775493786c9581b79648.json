  "title": "FDA Bans Juul From Selling E-Cigarettes; U.S. health officials order vaping pioneer to pull its products after two-year review",
  "text": "<p>Juul could seek a stay of the order through the FDA's appeals process or in court. The company didn't immediately comment on the FDA's announcement.</p><p>In a press release, the FDA said Juul's application to keep its vaporizers and refill pods on the market lacked sufficient evidence on the toxicological profile of its products.</p><p>Some of the research Juul submitted to the agency raised concerns because of insufficient and conflicting data—including potentially harmful chemicals leaching from the company's refill pods, the FDA said. The FDA hasn't received evidence suggesting an immediate hazard associated with the use of Juul, the agency said.</p><p>The FDA on Thursday told Juul that all of its products on the market must be removed or the agency could take enforcement action against Juul and retailers. Law enforcement won't take action against consumers using Juul products, the agency said.</p><p>The FDA recommended Juul users or cigarette smokers who wish to switch to e-cigarettes consider other products that the agency has authorized.</p><p>The marketing denial order follows a nearly two-year review of data presented by the vaping company, which sought authorization for its tobacco- and menthol-flavored products to stay on the U.S. market, where most recently Juul has been the No. 2 seller.</p><p>The agency has cleared the way for Juul's biggest rivals—Reynolds American Inc. and NJOY Holdings Inc.—to keep tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes on the market. Industry observers had expected Juul to receive similar clearance until The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday on the expected denial.</p><p>The burden to prove that tobacco products meet the standards set by U.S. law—that their benefits to adult cigarette smokers outweigh any risks or unintended consequences—falls on the shoulders of the company, Michele Mital, acting director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products, said in a statement.</p><p>\"Juul had the opportunity to provide evidence demonstrating that the marketing of their products meets these standards,\" she said. \"However, the company did not provide that evidence and instead left us with significant questions.\"</p><p>Uncertainty has clouded Juul since the FDA launched an investigation into the startup four years ago. Regulators, lawmakers and school administrators blamed Juul's fruity flavors, USB-drive shaped vaporizers and hip marketing for fueling a surge of underage vaping. Since then Juul has been trying to regain the trust of regulators and the public. It limited its marketing and in 2019 stopped selling sweet and fruity flavors.</p><p>The FDA order against Juul is a setback for Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc., which in 2018 paid $12.8 billion for a 35% stake in Juul. The deal valued Juul at about $38 billion. Since then, Juul's value has plummeted amid regulatory crackdowns and declining sales. Altria valued its Juul stake at $1.6 billion as of March 31.</p><p>Shares of Altria, which assisted Juul with its FDA application, fell 9.2% in Wednesday trading, after Journal reported on the expected FDA decision. Altria shares rose 1% in Thursday morning trading.</p><p>Juul surged to the top of the U.S. e-cigarette market in 2018, but it has lost some ground to other brands more recently. It slipped to second place behind Reynolds's Vuse brand in the 12 weeks ended June 4, according to an analysis of Nielsen data by Goldman Sachs analyst Bonnie Herzog. It currently sells e-cigarette devices and refill pods with tobacco and menthol flavors.</p><p>The FDA has been conducting a review of U.S. vaping products, weighing their popularity with young people against their potential benefits as less harmful alternatives for adult cigarette smokers. All U.S. e-cigarette manufacturers in 2020 were required to submit their products for FDA review to stay on the market.</p><p>The agency since last fall has ordered off the market more than a million vaping products. In April, for example, the FDA ordered off the U.S. market several tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarette products made by Fontem US, a subsidiary of Imperial Brands PLC. The agency said Fontem's applications \"lacked sufficient evidence regarding design features, manufacturing, and stability,\" and didn't demonstrate that their potential benefit to adult cigarette smokers outweighed the risk to young people.</p><p>The FDA is separately moving forward on a plan to mandate the elimination of nearly all nicotine in cigarettes, a policy that would upend the $95 billion U.S. cigarette industry and, health officials say, prompt millions of people to quit smoking or switch to alternatives such as e-cigarettes. That rule will take years to implement and tobacco companies could sue to fight it.</p><p>Write to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com</p><p>FDA Bans Juul From Selling E-Cigarettes</p>",
