  "text": "<p>Tencent has struck a £919m deal to buy the UK games developer Sumo Group as the Chinese tech company continues its years-long international gaming acquisition spree. </p> <p>Sumo, which was founded in Yorkshire in 2003, has developed games for Sony, Microsoft and Sega including instalments of the <em>Forza</em>, <em>Hitman</em>, <em>Sonic</em> and <em>LittleBigPlanet</em> franchises. </p> <p>Consolidation has been accelerating in the video games industry, as console-focused publishers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4479dd20-57ac-11e9-a3db-1fe89bedc16e\">snap up</a> mobile app developers and larger platforms try to secure exclusive content. </p> <p>Tencent's offer of 513p per share in cash, via its subsidiary Sixjoy Hong Kong, comes at a 43 per cent premium to Friday's closing share price. Shares in Sumo jumped to 508p in early trading on Monday morning in London. </p> <p>“The board of Sumo firmly believes the business will benefit from Tencent's broad videogaming ecosystem, proven industry expertise and its strategic resources,” said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2a89082-ec31-11e9-a240-3b065ef5fc55\">Ian Livingstone</a>, the UK gaming veteran who serves as Sumo's chair. </p> <p>If approved by shareholders, the deal would be another example of overseas buyers collecting part of the UK's flourishing games development industry, after California-based Electronic Arts closed its £945m <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62652af5-3b04-433f-8519-4b0b61d9b5a6\">acquisition of Codemasters</a> in February. </p> <p>Tencent, the Shenzhen-based owner of WeChat, took a minority stake in Sumo in November 2019, which is now worth 8.75 per cent of the company. Its portfolio of games companies already includes Supercell, the Finnish makers of <em>Clash of Clans</em>, and US-based <em>League of Legends</em> developer Riot Games, as well as minority stakes in Activision Blizzard, Epic Games, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5ed5d90-40cb-4065-a0e1-af4f6c47d7b1\">Voodoo</a>, Frontier Developments and Ubisoft. </p> <p>The move for Sumo came at a time when Tencent's investments and acquisitions have attracted <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97d8395b-6115-4147-b4d8-953ddbf729a4\">closer scrutiny</a> from regulators in the US and China, the world's two largest games markets, as part of broader crackdowns on Big Tech and Chinese companies' overseas dealmaking. </p> <p>Sumo went public on London's Aim at 100p a share in 2017, just over a year after it was acquired by private equity firm Perwyn. The company has 1,200 staff across 14 studios in five countries, including in India and Poland as well as around the UK. </p> <p>Perwyn, which owns about 17 per cent of Sumo, said it would recommend the Tencent offer. </p> <p>Ahead of Monday's announcement, Sumo's share price had more than doubled during the coronavirus pandemic, as lockdowns gave a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de3a2b2b-ed45-47d0-a900-4c71d8c38f62\">broad boost</a> to the gaming industry. </p> <p>However, the shares have risen only 7 per cent this year, with gaming growth appearing to slow as lockdowns were lifted. Last week, figures from NPD Group showed that overall consumer video game spending in the US grew 15 per cent year on year in the first half of 2021, compared with 27 per cent growth for 2020 over the previous year, with growth of just 1 per cent in software and content sales in June 2021. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs and Zeus Capital advised Sumo on the deal.</p><p>Source: Tim Bradshaw in London and Ryan McMorrow in Beijing 2021 'Tencent buys UK games company Sumo for £919m' FT.com 19 July.
