  "text": "<p>In a race seen as an early test of Democrats' efforts to use abortion access to motivate their base in competitive contests, Democrat Pat Ryan defeated Republican Marc Molinaro in a special election to fill an open House seat in New York's Hudson Valley, the Associated Press projected.</p><p>In other elections held Tuesday, voters in Florida and Oklahoma set the matchups for closely watched races this fall.</p><p>In Florida, U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist defeated state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried for the Democratic nomination for governor and the right to take on incumbent Gov. Ron DeSantis, a rising Republican star.</p><p>The Democratic candidates in Florida had debated who was best suited for that uphill battle and, in the wake of the Supreme Court decision eliminating a constitutional right to abortion, who would be the most effective advocate for abortion rights.</p><p>In a Senate primary, Democratic Rep. Val Demings won the party's nomination to run against Republican Sen. Marco Rubio.</p><p>In the House seat being vacated by Ms. Demings, 25-year-old Maxwell Frost, a candidate backed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), won a Democratic primary against two former Democratic lawmakers, Alan Grayson and Corrine Brown. The district is heavily Democratic. In an interview, Mr. Frost, a gun-control activist, said that his interest in politics began after the 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School.</p><p>Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.), a close ally of Mr. Trump, won his GOP primary, essentially ensuring re-election in his solidly Republican district. Mr. Gaetz will face Democrat Rebekah Jones.</p><p>In New York City, Democrats poured their energy into primary contests for the 10th and 12th districts. Longtime Reps. Nadler and Maloney found themselves facing off when they were drawn together in the 12th District, which includes Midtown Manhattan and residential areas surrounding Central Park.</p><p>Another incumbent, freshman Rep. Mondaire Jones, was defeated in a Democratic primary for a district covering Manhattan and Brooklyn. Dan Goldman, a former federal prosecutor who also served as lead counsel in Mr. Trump's first impeachment, finished first in the crowded field, with Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou in second and Mr. Jones in third.</p><p>Mr. Goldman, an heir to the Levi Strauss &amp; Co. fortune, has lent his campaign several million dollars and has outspent his rivals. Ms. Niou was backed by the progressive Working Families Party.</p><p>Following redistricting, Mr. Jones scrapped plans to seek re-election from his Westchester County home when a more senior member, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, said he would run there. Mr. Maloney, who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, won his primary race against state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi.</p><p>In Oklahoma, Rep. Markwayne Mullin won a GOP primary runoff in the race to fill the remainder of the term of retiring Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe. Mr. Mullin defeated T.W. Shannon, who was the first Black person to serve as House speaker in Oklahoma.</p><p>Mr. Mullin will take on former Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn in a special election this fall in the deep red state. Mr. Inhofe, who plans to retire in early January, was elected to a six-year term in 2020.</p><p>Separately, in an Oklahoma Democratic primary, Madison Horn beat Jason Bollinger to be the party's candidate against incumbent Republican Sen. James Lankford in the fall.</p><p>New Yorkers cast ballots in two special elections for the U.S. House as well as in primary elections for Congress and the state Senate. All New York primaries were originally scheduled for June 28, but the congressional and state Senate contests were moved to August after a judge struck down Democrat-drawn district lines.</p><p>In the Hudson Valley's 19th District, the AP projected just after midnight that Mr. Ryan, a Democrat, defeated the GOP's Mr. Molinaro in a closely watched contest to fill the term of ex-Rep. Antonio Delgado. With most of the vote counted, Mr. Ryan led 51.1% to 48.9%.</p><p>Mr. Ryan, the Ulster County executive, aired ads touting his support for abortion access after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in July. Mr. Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, said abortion policy should be left to states and has said he personally opposes abortion.</p><p>Both also campaigned on inflation and the cost of living. Mr. Molinaro highlighted the rise in prices under President Biden said Democrats' tax, healthcare and climate package signed into law last week would do little to curb inflation. Mr. Ryan supports that measure.</p><p>The seat opened up when Gov. Kathy Hochul appointed Mr. Delgado as lieutenant governor when the previous holder of that office, Brian Benjamin, resigned after he was charged in an alleged bribery scheme. Mr. Benjamin has pleaded not guilty.</p><p>The other special election is to serve out the end of the term of former GOP Rep. Tom Reed, who canceled his re-election efforts after apologizing for inappropriate sexual conduct and later resigned to take a job at a government-relations firm. In the red-leaning district, Republican Joe Sempolinski defeated Democrat Max Della Pia, who is also running in the November general election for the term starting next year.</p><p>Mr. Sempolinski will serve about four months as he isn't running for the next full term. In the GOP primary for that full term, Nick Langworthy defeated Carl Paladino after a heated contest in which both candidates have expressed their long ties to Mr. Trump. He hasn't made an endorsement in the race.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What are you watching for in this week's primaries? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Mr. Langworthy chairs the state Republican Party but is seeking elected office for the first time. Mr. Paladino, a real-estate developer, was the GOP's 2010 gubernatorial candidate after he harnessed tea party support for an unexpected primary victory over the party-endorsed candidate. He lost in the general election.</p><p>Joshua Jamerson and Arian Campo-Flores contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Jimmy Vielkind at Jimmy.Vielkind@wsj.com and Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com</p><p>Jerrold Nadler Defeats Carolyn Maloney in New York Democratic House Primary Matchup</p>",
