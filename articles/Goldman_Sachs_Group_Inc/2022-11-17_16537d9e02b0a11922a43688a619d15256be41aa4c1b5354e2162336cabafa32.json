While Bullard didn't explicitly say in his speech how high the rate needs to go, the policy maker did say the rate would have to be increased further to reach a \"sufficiently restrictive level.\" Read: This is the chart that is rattling U.S. financial markets Thursday</p><p>Some traders were taking Bullard's estimates with a grain of salt, however, considering his reputation as something of an outlier on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. As of Thursday afternoon, markets were pricing in an 81% probability that the Fed will raise borrowing costs by another 50 basis points, to a range of 4.25% to 4.5% on Dec. 14, and a 19% chance of a 75-basis-point hike next month, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Traders also moved up their expectations for how high the fed-funds rate target might go next year, to further above 5%, but they don't yet see a significant chance of a 6% policy rate.</p><p>Read: Goldman Sachs sees new rate hike in 2023, with targeted range for fed funds rising to 5%-5.25%</p><p>In U.S. economic releases on Thursday, initial weekly jobless claims fell slightly to 222,000 in mid-November. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected new claims to total 225,000 for the seven days that ended Nov. 12. The Philadelphia Fed'smanufacturing index sank to negative 19.4 in November from negative 8.7 in the prior month, and construction on new houses fell 4.2% in October.</p><p>U.K. 10-year gilt yields BX:TMBMKGB-10Y rose 5.4 basis points to 3.201% after the government'sautumn budget statement.</p><p>What are analysts saying</p><p>\"The idea of rate hikes continuing for longer was supported by several Fed speakers, who were sounding more hawkish, commenting that there is still plenty of work to do. James Bullard, known for his hawkish stance, said that even dovish policy assumptions require further rate hikes,\" said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index in London.</p><p>Bond-market recession gauge goes more negative after Bullard's 5%-7% fed-funds rate estimate</p>",
