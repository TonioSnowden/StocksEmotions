Shalett said the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI index, a gauge of U.S. factories, also is \"signaling concern,\" as it shows growth is decelerating.</p><p>Both stocks and bonds have suffered this year as the Fed seeks to battle inflation by raising interest rates. \"A portfolio with equal parts stocks and bonds would have been down more than 10% in the last six months, the worst experience since the financial crisis,\" Shalett wrote. \"With the inflation fight now on in earnest and the Fed policy regime turned hawkish, the rise in interest rates has been punishing.\"</p><p>Major U.S. stock benchmarks ended mixed Monday amid concerns over global economic growth, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA eking out a 0.1% gain, the S&amp;P 500 SPX slipping 0.4% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP dropping 1.2%, according to FactSet data.

The Fed is aiming to tame hot inflation by raising rates without causing a recession, or achieving a so-called soft landing.</p><p>Read: Stock market's 'ultimate lows' are still ahead as investors have not yet capitulated, says B. of A.</p><p>Clissold said that over the next several weeks the market will probably continue to see high volatility while \"testing\" recent lows to gauge to what extent selling may be \"exhausted.\"</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is currently in correction territory, having tumbled almost 16% this year, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite is in a bear market, having dropped more than 25% so far in 2022, according to FactSet data.
