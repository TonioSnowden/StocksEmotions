  "title": "Oil prices hit three-year high as gas crunch starts to affect crude market",
  "text": "<p>Oil prices climbed on Monday to the highest level in three years on mounting expectations the natural gas crisis will spill over into other commodities at the same time as the global economic recovery boosts demand. </p> <p>Brent, the international benchmark, rose for a fifth straight day, adding 1.4 per cent to $79.22 a barrel. The price of Brent has advanced about 50 per cent this year and 9 per cent this month.</p> <p>The strong rally comes as businesses and consumers increase their usage of everything from petrol to aeroplane fuel at a time when governments are lifting social curbs imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs, one of the most influential banks in commodity markets, said it expected the rally to continue and forecast Brent to hit $90 a barrel by the end of the year, up from a previous estimate of $80. </p> <p>“The current global oil supply-demand deficit is larger than we expected,” it said, adding that demand had recovered “even faster” from the impact of the Delta coronavirus variant than anticipated, and that global supply remained constrained.</p> <p>The oil price increase comes amid a wider rally in energy markets, particularly in gas, which has hit record prices in recent weeks driven by under-investment in production, high demand and competition for supply between Europe and China. The impact of the gas crunch has been felt across several industries and is expected to lead to a rise in oil-fired power generation in some countries if gas prices remain high.</p> <p>“The tightness in broader energy markets continues to be constructive for oil,” said Warren Patterson, head of commodities at ING, adding that it would lead to “gas to oil switching” in the power business. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs added: “Winter demand risks are further now squarely skewed to the upside [regarding] the global gas shortage will increase oil fired power generation.”</p> <p>At the same time, the long-term effects of Hurricane Ida continue to be felt in the US, where some production in the Gulf of Mexico remains offline due to storm damage. Lower than expected US output was contributing to tight global supply and helping to push prices higher, according to Stephen Brennock at oil broker PVM.</p> <p>Though he added that US oil was now comparatively cheap compared with the rest of the world — West Texas Intermediate, the US oil marker, hit $75 on Monday — in a positive sign for future US exports. </p> <p>“The dark clouds of Hurricane Ida may have not yet fully lifted but brighter days still lie ahead for US crude exports,” he said.</p> <p>Opec, the oil producers' cartel, and its allies have been gradually restoring supply that they curtailed at the start of the pandemic but resisted pressure, in particular from the US, to increase output quicker to cool prices.</p> <p>Patterson at ING said the latest oil price move would make for an “interesting Opec+ meeting next week”, when the group gathers to decide whether to continue restoring production levels by 400,000 barrels a day each month, as previously agreed. “If prices continue to trend higher between now and the meeting, I would not rule out the potential for even more aggressive easing,” he added.</p> <p>European energy majors BP, Shell and Total all climbed about 3 per cent on Monday afternoon.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/a8bc0c5b-63f4-439b-b0c9-e9da46848cf4.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Tom Wilson in London 2021 'Oil prices hit three-year high as gas crunch starts to affect crude market' FT.com 27 September.
