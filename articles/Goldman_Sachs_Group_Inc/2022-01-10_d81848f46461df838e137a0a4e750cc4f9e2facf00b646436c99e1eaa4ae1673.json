  "title": "First Reserve Extends Its Hold on Refuel With Single-Asset Secondary Deal; Goldman Sachs Asset Management was lead investor in sponsor-led single-asset transaction, which closed with nearly $511 million",
  "text": "<p>Secondary advisory firm Sixpoint Capital worked with First Reserve on the continuation fund deal, according to the people and a regulatory filing.</p><p>Stamford, Conn.-based First Reserve initially acquired Refuel Inc. in 2019 along with another South Carolina-based gas station operator West Oil Inc., which it merged into Refuel. The firm financed the deal out of its energy-focused fund, First Reserve XIII LP, which, according to a regulatory filing, raised some $3.39 billion in 2014.</p><p>Since the initial deal, First Reserve has expanded Refuel through other acquisitions, including most recently San Antonio-based Action Fuels LP, a wholesale and retail duel distribution and convenience-store chain, and Wag-A-Bag LLC, an Austin, Texas-based owner and operator of convenience stores with Shell- and Valero-branded fuels.</p><p>First Reserve is among a number of private-equity investors using continuation funds or special-purpose vehicles to retain ownership of individual companies for longer. Sponsor-led single asset deals, like the one for Refuel, accounted for 25% of the $48 billion of transaction volume in the first half of last year, according to a survey by secondary adviser Evercore Inc. Other firms that have done such deals in recent months include Clearlake Capital Group, Lime Rock Partners and NewSpring Capital.</p><p>First Reserve makes investments in energy and natural resources companies across three broad segments: natural resources, equipment and services as well as midstream and downstream oil-and-gas companies. Over the years, the firm has evolved its focus beyond a legacy emphasis on oil and gas exploration and production to include energy infrastructure, renewable energy, energy equipment and services, manufacturing, energy technology, as well as mining and minerals resources.</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com</p>",
