  "text": "<p>Shares in China Evergrande jumped by the most this year after the debt-laden property developer offered a rare reprieve to investors by dangling the prospect of a surprise dividend payment.</p> <p>Evergrande is one of China's biggest corporate borrowers on international markets and is helmed by <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c446f877-5673-480a-a847-8f08a1da5e7d\">tycoon Hui Ka Yan</a>, once China's richest man.</p> <p>The billionaire and his company have been under <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1144ffe-30f9-41d3-b033-bb82eca258b4\">immense investor scrutiny</a> over how Evergrande will meet requirements by Beijing for sweeping leverage reductions across the property sector after years of aggressive debt-fuelled expansion.</p> <p>The Hong Kong-listed group's shares fell by almost a third in the first half of the year when they were also hit by tightening credit conditions in China and signs Beijing is slowly stepping back from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e56ad0fa-4357-4b16-aa98-c9994317ec0d\">implicit state-backed guarantees</a> for under-pressure conglomerates.</p> <p>However, on Friday the stock rose as much as 14 per cent to its highest point since the depths of the Covid-19 crisis early last year after Evergrande said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange that its board would meet to discuss its first special dividend in three years.</p> <p>The company could not immediately be reached for comment. Its shares closed 9.5 per cent higher on Friday.</p> <p>Investors view Evergrande's recovery as being closely pegged to Hui's success or failure in navigating the Chinese government's “three red lines”, which were introduced almost a year ago in response to concerns over house price increases. The measures limit companies' borrowing across three metrics: debt-to-cash, net debt-to-equity and debt-to-assets.&#xa0;</p> <p>Evergrande suffered a&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/839f6efe-5902-4e0f-845c-a862ee58782b\">frantic sell-off in its stock and bonds last year</a>&#xa0;linked to a plan to list shares in subsidiary Hengda Real Estate. </p> <p>Investor confidence was further dented last month after Fitch, the US rating agency, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae65aea5-d013-46e0-b3a3-8baf86fc31b9\">downgraded</a> the Chinese developer from B plus to B for its long-term foreign currency ratings. Fitch said its first downgrade on Evergrande in five years reflected pressures to both downsize the company and reduce its debt.</p> <p>Still, Goldman Sachs analysts noted that management had set out <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a55934db-9ce9-405c-998c-1148e403ca88\">plans for meeting Beijing's “red lines”</a> by the end of 2022, six months ahead of a mid-2023 deadline. The plan involves cutting debt to below Rmb450bn by the middle of 2022, from Rmb717bn at the end of last year.</p> <p>“On the back of a Rmb653bn cash inflow from property sales in 2020 . . . Evergrande has made some positive progress toward deleveraging,” the analysts wrote.</p> <p>Yet Goldman Sachs also highlighted risks facing the company including further debt increases if Evergrande resumes aggressive expansion, the potential for faster-than-expected interest rate increases and liquidity controls by the Chinese government.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong </em></p><p>Source: Edward White in Seoul 2021 'Shares in debt-laden Evergrande surge as developer teases dividend' FT.com 16 July.
