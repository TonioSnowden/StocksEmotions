  "title": "Fed's Bostic Warns Eviction Surge Could Weigh on Recovery; Atlanta Fed chief worries evictions could prolong Covid crisis",
  "text": "<p>Government aid for these renters hasn't been deployed sufficiently and that needs to change to help them and the economy as it tries to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Bostic said.</p><p>A wave of evictions \"is going to exacerbate all the problems that we have right now, and I do have a concern\" because this \"could prolong this Covid pandemic crisis, and leave us in a much more precarious position\" with the recovery.</p><p>Mr. Bostic, leader of the Atlanta Fed since 2017, has a history of housing sector expertise. Between 2009 and 2012 he was assistant secretary for policy development and research at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and he has also worked on housing issues in his academic career.</p><p>The U.S. economy has recovered more quickly than expected from the pandemic's impact, but resurgent cases of illness tied to the Delta coronavirus variant is clouding its outlook.</p><p>The national eviction moratorium ended last week after the Supreme Court didn't extend the emergency measure. Government aid has been put in place to help troubled renters but much of that money has failed to get to those who need it most.</p><p>Mr. Bostic's worry that widespread evictions could harm the recovery isn't fully shared by some on Wall Street. In a note earlier this week, economists at investment bank Goldman Sachs estimated that 750,000 households that collectively owe billions in unpaid rent could be booted from their homes. But in terms of economic impact, the bank said data suggests \"a small drag on consumption and job growth from an eviction episode of this magnitude\" even as it helps blunt some of the upward pressure on inflation tied to housing issues.</p><p>Write to Michael S.
