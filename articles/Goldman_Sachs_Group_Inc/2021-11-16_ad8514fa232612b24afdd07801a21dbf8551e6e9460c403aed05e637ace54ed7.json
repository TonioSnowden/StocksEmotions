  "text": "<p>Off the top:</p> <p>— Just days after the COP26 deal talked about “phasing down” coal, prices in the US have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/180e4544-6448-48d2-a347-5f9d27b43d61\">hit their highest point</a> since 2009. </p> <p>— European carbon prices <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3d33f16-9e8c-4657-8ca5-c988464a55c7\">also hit a new high</a> following the Glasgow conference. </p> <p>— And Charlie Penner, who spearheaded the Engine No 1 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebfdf67d-cbce-40a5-bb29-d361377dea7a\">campaign that defeated ExxonMobil</a> in a bitter proxy fight earlier this year, has left the activist hedge fund to run new campaigns independently. He may target other energy companies. Or Exxon again. “I am grateful for the time I spent there and look forward to new campaigns,” he told me. Engine No 1 said it appreciated his “tremendously valuable” work, especially on&#xa0;Exxon.</p> <p>Welcome back to another Energy Source.</p> <p>And to start: a question for everyone. What do you want from Energy Source? Please let us know, by clicking on this <a href=\"https://survey.ft.com/jfe/form/SV_0prW546fBzxXilw\">short&#xa0;survey</a>.</p> <p>The big news in the energy world is that Royal Dutch Shell is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da1e14c9-2a4a-4b1e-8f44-7b4eae14f7f9\">ditching</a> its HQ in the Netherlands, where earlier this year a court told the company to speed up its emissions reductions, and moving to the UK. It will drop the Royal Dutch part of its name too.</p> <p>But not so fast. Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte is trying to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6339b89b-af46-480f-b34e-8c7fb6ae1e60\">scrap a tax quickly</a> enough to keep the company on his side of the North Sea. The company will make its&#xa0;decision&#xa0;in December.</p> <p>Does this matter to anyone except the 11 Shell executives who, according to Morgan Stanley, would need to move, or the many accountants and consultants who would now be asked to streamline and unify the oil company's notoriously tricky dual-listing structure?</p> <p>Shell thinks the move could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3a4835b-85e5-4895-86a2-cb4d3f372940\">help</a> it pay its dividend and increase buybacks: a simpler structure means quicker cash returns, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a893762-fb62-41f4-88d6-0d03f1f49336\">argue</a> our colleagues at Lex. If the move is, as some suspect, about escaping the Dutch courts (Shell says it is not), the UK move <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/706fa3a7-c831-401a-a991-95323ed58436\">might not work</a>.</p> <p>In any case, it is hard not to see some cognitive dissonance at play, as two governments that have legally committed to decarbonise their economies now scrap over where one of the world's biggest fossil fuel producers will be based. If the Dutch government can't cope without Shell's tax revenue right now, wait till it hears about the tax revenue from the fossil fuel sector when it doesn't produce fossil fuels any more. </p> <p>But after COP26, that future appears distant anyway. The Anglo-Dutch Shell squabble is a fitting coda to the Glasgow summit. More on this in our first note. </p> <p>In our second item, Justin Jacobs writes about Biden and the Bakken. And Amanda Chu has more evidence of American anxiety about petrol prices. </p> <p>Thanks for reading.</p> <h1>COP26 fails to phase out fossil fuels </h1> <p>As the dust settles on the latest COP, one takeaway from its modest deal is that governments are finding it fiendishly hard to envisage a world beyond fossil fuels. Forget committing to get rid of coal — a difficult task for a world in which energy needs are rising, not falling. </p> <p>The final COP26 <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/conferences/glasgow-climate-change-conference-october-november-2021/outcomes-of-the-glasgow-climate-change-conference\">agreement</a> calls on countries to pursue measures including “accelerating efforts” to phase down, not out, their coal use. And only the “unabated” kind. So coal plus carbon capture will be just fine, even though carbon capture technology remains peripheral (and isn't working as well as planned, as Chevron is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/chevron-invest-29-mln-address-co2-injection-shortfall-australia-lng-site-2021-11-11/#:~:text=Gorgon%20CCS%20was%20designed%20to,a%20range%20of%20technical%20problems.\">discovering</a>). Meanwhile, the Biden government — like China and India — couldn't even put its name to the <a href=\"https://ukcop26.org/global-coal-to-clean-power-transition-statement/\">clean power plan</a> and its coal commitments. </p> <p>And only “inefficient” fossil fuel subsidies will be canned. But which governments currently think their fossil fuel subsidies are inefficient? And which is brave enough to scrap them while anxieties about inflation and soaring natural gas, coal and petrol prices are front of mind?</p> <p>A global deal to cut methane pollution — a priority, given its atmospheric warming potency — was arguably the biggest achievement of a two-week meeting that otherwise failed to close the <a href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/publications/glasgows-2030-credibility-gap-net-zeros-lip-service-to-climate-action/\">credibility gap</a>. But that methane deal excludes many of the worst polluters. And although the US trumpeted its leadership of that pact, it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76d3b219-65c9-4b02-8c8b-ccc9d16631fa\">didn't</a> — unlike the EU — back the International Methane Emissions Observatory, the body that will actually monitor the pollution levels and make the global pledge more than just talk. </p> <p>This isn't to discount some of COP26's <a href=\"https://ukcop26.org/global-coal-to-clean-power-transition-statement/\">outcomes</a>. Nikos Tsafos at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that even phasing “down” coal was a win — if not the one that campaigners hoped for. “Zero is the goal, but even a small number is success,” he <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/battle-coal-cop26\">said</a>.</p> <p>Elsewhere, pacts on deforestation and slowing the sales of petrol cars were welcome — if imperfect. That fossil fuels were mentioned at all in the final text was a first. The unexpected US-China declaration that they would co-operate on climate change was also a positive step. And, remember, all of this is voluntary. </p> <p>But overall, the outcome could lead to more international friction on carbon, not less, said analysts at ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington consultancy, as European authorities move to tighten emissions rules unilaterally.</p> <blockquote>  <p>“We think that the underwhelming result at COP26 could add momentum to regulated economies' pursuit of bottom-up, trade-mediated climate policies to protect against carbon ‘leakage,' stoking nascent carbon trade war,” they said. </p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, ask yourself if big fossil fuel producers, carbon emitters, or the rest of us who consume all this oil and gas feel like the world has just been put on a new path. The fossil fuel executives gathered in Abu Dhabi this week <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/oil/111521-feature-at-adipec-oil-industry-collects-its-breath-after-cop26-celebrates-its-future\">didn't give off the vibe</a> that COP26 had set the timer ticking on their industry. No wonder the Dutch and British governments want to keep hold of their prize fossil fuel producer, its taxes, and the dividends that keep their pensioners happy. Breaking off fossil fuels is proving tricky. <em>(Derek Brower) </em></p> <h1>How Wall Street has stymied US shale growth</h1> <p>The Bakken rock formation in North Dakota, birthplace of the American shale oil revolution, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29743712-e42c-467e-8dbb-94a4b8e0f602\">may never pump oil at the pace</a> it did before the pandemic. </p> <p>Analysts say that is because producers are keeping a tight grip on spending, while at the same time most of the pioneering shale field's best wells have already been drilled.</p> <p>It's part of the broader, slow recovery in America's oil patch this year, even as crude prices have soared to around $80 a barrel. Those prices would have sparked a frenzy of drilling a few years ago.</p> <p>Many in the industry blame the Biden administration's green push for the slowdown.</p> <p>I argued in a column over the weekend that it is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bfa55ab1-5ed8-42de-be28-6e5cb2bf0f3f\">Wall Street's drive</a> to wean the shale sector off its addiction to growth, not the Biden administration's climate policies, that is behind the slowdown.</p> <p>It sparked a fiery — and partisan — debate.</p> <p>The most trenchant pushback I received is that green political pressure is behind Wall Street's increasing reticence towards the oil sector, which is in turn slowing oil supply. </p> <p>Fresh scrutiny of the industry's environmental performance has raised questions over how much capital will be available to oil producers, and at what cost, in the future.</p> <p>But there is no cash crunch in the industry. The big debate in the sector right now is not over whether to finance shale development — high oil and gas prices are taking care of that — it is how the industry should spend the influx of cash from surging commodity prices. </p> <p>Wall Street has demanded that far more of that cash go back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, leaving less for fresh supply. Is this driven by ESG concerns or President Joe Biden's federal leasing decisions or pipeline approval? I don't think so.</p> <p>ESG-minded investing and government policies that restrict fossil fuel supplies could still drive future price spikes if demand doesn't ease off in line with supply. This idea is behind many of the calls for a fossil fuel supercycle, as Goldman Sachs's Jeff Currie <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7732d53-2e34-4fde-b5fb-6f45f114111f\">has argued</a>.</p> <p>But future prices for US WTI oil are telling a different story. A WTI crude contract for late 2025 can be bought for around $60 a barrel, $20 less than the current price. The futures curve is no crystal ball, but it does show that the market right now is betting on cheaper oil in the future.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the Biden administration will continue to pay a political price for today's high fuel prices — the most visible aspect of inflation to most Americans. </p> <p>A big question is whether that will alter its approach to oil and gas issues. </p> <p>Yesterday, the White House announced a ban on new oil and gas drilling within a ten mile radius of the Chaco Canyon Native American heritage site in New Mexico, which the state's main industry lobby group said would “rob local communities of jobs and economic growth opportunities”.</p> <p>However, the Biden administration will also hold its first lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico tomorrow, a step that was forced by the courts. Will the industry show up? (<em>Justin Jacobs</em>)</p> <h1>Data Drill</h1> <p>Americans are on the hunt for cheaper gas. The number of daily active users for fuel-finder app GasBuddy is up 67 per cent from the same time last year, according to data from Apptopia. The spike in daily users comes as US petrol sells for <a href=\"https://gasprices.aaa.com/\">60 per cent</a> plus more than a year ago, adding to Americans' worries about inflation. Prices are highest in the state of California, which <a href=\"https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=CA\">broke its record</a> for highest petrol price yesterday for the second day in a row, according to AAA. </p> <p>International readers may wonder why Americans are complaining. Drivers in the UK, Germany, and Sweden are paying more than double what US drivers pay at the pump. In Hong Kong, motorists pay more than $10 a gallon for the world's priciest petrol. </p> <p>Higher petrol prices are burdening households worldwide. In the US, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/def33497-1064-411a-8271-a5d0fca07cf5\">higher prices</a> hit low-income Americans the hardest and do not bode well for the White House and the Democratic Party as Biden has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/842ae43a-3c2b-4509-8731-a5570f693181\">few tools</a> at his disposal to provide Americans with relief. Opec+ has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a2fc7b2-c963-4418-9997-d1bf203c3a35\">rejected US pleas</a> to increase output and for weeks the administration has been considering the release of emergency petroleum reserves, an action pushed by Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer over the weekend. <em>(Amanda Chu)</em></p> <h1>Power Points</h1> <ul>  <li><p>Companies are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1d0e4d5-b42f-4287-8bfe-319f31a7acbe\">linking executive pay</a> to climate targets — with murky results. </p></li>  <li><p>Low wind speeds are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f17c060-8d82-4192-baa6-e395685595b0\">driving UK power</a> prices to nearly record highs.</p></li>  <li><p>Opinion: Why global climate conferences are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae6a8e8f-94db-4f06-a377-343a84e9be4d\">doomed to fail</a> and the case for geoengineering. </p></li>  <li><p>Chevron is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/chevron-to-use-offsets-after-australian-carbon-capture-struggles?sref=OziMsGoK\">buying millions</a> of greenhouse gas offsets after a carbon capture failure.
