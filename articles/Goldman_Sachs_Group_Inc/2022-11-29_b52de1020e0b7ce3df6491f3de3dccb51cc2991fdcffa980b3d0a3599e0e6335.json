  "title": "Macau Finally Draws a Winning Hand; License renewals, hints of hope on China's reopening are starting to lift casino shares",
  "text": "<p>Shares of casino operators jumped this week: Wynn Macau Ltd. has gained 24%, while Sands China Ltd. is up 13%.</p><p>Still, what comes next remains out of their control—their fortunes over the next year depend mostly on what Beijing decides to do about its strict but unpopular Covid-19 restrictions. Macau stocks have been among the biggest gainers this month after China fine-tuned its pandemic policies in early November, sparking hopes that it might finally walk away from its strict zero-Covid regime. Macau shares remain much lower, however, compared with prepandemic levels.</p><p>Chinese visitors are once again allowed to go to Macau by getting online visas starting this month, which should make their travel easier. But surging Covid-19 cases in China— especially in the neighboring Guangdong province—and lockdowns across the country have translated to only a mild pickup in visitors in November so far. Macau's gambling revenue in the first 10 months of 2022 is down 85% from the same period in 2019, while visitor arrivals have dropped by a similar percentage.</p><p>The economic and fiscal toll of China's pandemic-control policies, as well as the social unrest it has now caused, might finally force Beijing to pivot away—though how long that will take is uncertain. But an eventual reopening will be a big jackpot for Macau gambling companies, which have had to burn cash and load up debt over the past couple of years to maintain largely empty casinos.</p><p>Earnings will probably take a while to return to prepandemic levels whatever happens, given the additional interest expense from all that debt, but some financially stronger players such as Sands China and Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. will be worth a look for investors when China's road map out of zero-Covid becomes clearer.</p><p>Meanwhile, however, China's economic slowdown will hurt spending from gamblers. And high rollers might not return in substantial numbers given China's crackdown on illicit capital outflows.</p><p>Still, Macau shares are trading at deep discount: Their current enterprise value is only eight times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2019, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p><p>Macau's losing streak has lasted a long time. It might finally be time for investors to start placing bets again.</p><p>Write to Jacky Wong at jacky.wong@wsj.com</p><p>Macau Finally Draws a Winning Hand</p>",
