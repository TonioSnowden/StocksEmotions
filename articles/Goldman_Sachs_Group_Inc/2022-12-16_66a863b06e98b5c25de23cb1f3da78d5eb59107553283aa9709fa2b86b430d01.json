  "text": "<p><strong>In today's newsletter:</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p>Musk on markets</p></li>  <li><p>The tale of First Boston</p></li>  <li><p>Foley buys Bournemouth</p></li> </ul> <h1>Elon Musk becomes a Fed watcher</h1> <p>During a post-crisis era of low interest rates, <strong>Elon Musk</strong> became the wealthiest person on earth by using opportunistic stock and convertible debt offerings to finance the rise of <strong>Tesla</strong>.</p> <p>When its shares soared, he turned Tesla into an ATM, borrowing billions against its stock to broaden his empire.</p> <p>It's fitting that Musk has now become Wall Street's poster child for getting caught off-guard as surging interest rates this year put a halt to the era of cheap money.</p> <p>Musk impulsively agreed to buy <strong>Twitter</strong> for $44bn just as the tide turned and was unable to back out. Now he's facing a steamroller from the <strong>Federal</strong> <strong>Reserve</strong>. This week, he used his new position as a social media mogul to prognosticate on central bank liquidity. </p> <p>“At risk of stating obvious, beware of debt in turbulent macroeconomic conditions, especially when Fed keeps raising rates,” Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1602806063606075392\">tweeted</a> on December 13. <strong>Ray</strong> <strong>Dalio</strong> and <strong>Howard</strong> <strong>Marks</strong> could take tips in brevity from the billionaire.</p> <p>As he was tweeting, Musk was also selling Tesla stock. From Monday to Wednesday of this week, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eebe35a5-a780-4dd2-9915-c14e845ecaea#comments-anchor\">Musk sold more than $3.5bn of Tesla shares</a>, the FT reported. &#xa0;</p> <p>The cash should help Musk trim his sizeable debts just as rising rates make them increasingly burdensome.</p> <p>He'll be able to retire billions of dollars in high-cost debt that was used to finance his Twitter takeover. </p> <p>Banks led by <strong>Morgan Stanley </strong>haven't been able to syndicate $12.7bn of debt they funded for the buyout. Musk could potentially repurchase Twitter's costliest debt at a discount, saving himself hundreds of millions of dollars in annual interest costs in the process.</p> <p>Bankers and lawyers tell DD they're ending the year with a heavy slate of Rote “liability management” transactions, the act of alleviating or even restructuring overburdensome debt loads.</p> <p>Musk is self-administering his own unwinding, but he may uncover a juicy trade browbeating Morgan Stanley, of which he's a whale of a client.</p> <p>Margining Tesla stock to buy Twitter debt off its books would be a good arbitrage for Musk. Margin loans can be secured at about 250-to-350 basis points over Sofr, the floating interest rate benchmark, bankers told DD's Eric Platt — a far better rate than Twitter's current interest cost.</p> <p>Musk did well conserving Tesla's cash on his road to riches. Now that his fortune is plunging, he appears aware that every penny counts.</p> <h1>Resurrecting the ghost of Credit Suisse past&#xa0;</h1> <p>While cutting his teeth at <strong>First Boston </strong>in the 1980s, options trader <strong>Nassim Nicholas Taleb </strong>did not take well to his first career evaluation. <a href=\"https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/encounter/69922/\">“I tore it to pieces in front of them,”</a> he told New York Magazine.</p> <p>Instead of getting fired, he later proceeded to make what he called “fuck you” money by shorting the market on Black Monday in 1987 — the day the Dow plunged by 22.6 per cent, the largest one-day percentage drop in the index's history — before moving on to <strong>UBS</strong>.</p> <p>He wasn't the only one at First Boston, the once celebrated investment bank taken over by<strong> Credit Suisse</strong> in 1988, to make a name for himself.</p> <p>The newly minted graduates <strong>Joe Perella </strong>and<strong> Bruce Wasserstein</strong> would become the biggest rainmakers on Wall Street. <strong>Laurence Fink</strong>, a talented First Boston mortgage bond trader, would also leave to start a little money manager called<strong> BlackRock</strong>. <strong>Adebayo Ogunlesi</strong>, First Boston's former head of investment banking, went on to launch <strong>Global Infrastructure Partners</strong>.</p> <p>The bank itself, though, didn't age well. Caught in the highly lucrative but risky junk bond craze popularised at the time by <strong>Michael Milken</strong>'s <strong>Drexel Burnham Lambert</strong>, First Boston's game of leveraged loan roulette left it with huge paper losses.</p> <p>By 2005, things had become so bad that Credit Suisse dropped the First Boston name altogether.</p> <p>For a while, working at First Boston carried a certain cache akin to Goldman or Morgan Stanley. As recently as this year, alumni would give their name and then say “First Boston” when answering the phone, a former Credit Suisse banker <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83f639e1-b6bd-49b4-a048-aec3457eec2e\">told</a> DD's Sujeet Indap and James Fontanella-Khan.</p> <p>But that prestige has since faded and become a distant memory. As has the reputation of Credit Suisse, for that matter, as DD readers will be painfully aware.</p> <p><strong>Michael Klein</strong>, the ex-<strong>Citigroup </strong>dealmaker and former Credit Suisse board member who re-entered the spotlight as a face of the Spac boom, thinks he can resuscitate two birds with one stone.</p> <p>He has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09a1fb3a-54f2-4830-9ba7-8c86ea917071\">tasked with restoring</a> <strong>First Boston</strong>, the soon-to-be-spun-off advisory and corporate finance firm of which the Swiss lender hopes will solve many of its problems, to its former glory.</p> <p>The next incarnation of First Boston would do best to leave its proclivity for junk bonds in the past, especially as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3cd7b98-eec0-44b1-8060-af543ae59361\">temptation looms large</a>.</p> <h1>Bill Foley: from Spac-man to Bournemouth fan</h1> <p>The top end of English football is like catnip for big characters. Russian oligarchs, former prime ministers, royalty — they've all put skin in the game. All signs point to the fact that the latest club owners to join them won't disappoint.</p> <p>Leading the £120mn acquisition of <strong>AFC Bournemouth</strong>, a team on the south coast of England, is <strong>Bill Foley</strong>. </p> <p>The US Air Force and Wall Street veteran has been known to write blank cheques. He dabbled in the Spac boom, including his <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blankcheck-pinnacle-fds-exclusive/exclusive-dealmaker-chu-pinnacle-chairman-partner-to-buy-consumer-firms-sources-idUSKBN1JL2OL\">$600mn Spac</a> with famed former Blackstone dealmaker <strong>Chinh Chu</strong> in 2018 and a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7629f86f-65ed-4ee6-824f-30d291f186b6\">blank-cheque deal</a> with UK fintech group <strong>Paysafe</strong> in 2020.</p> <p>Now, the US billionaire — who also owns the <strong>Vegas Golden Knights</strong> ice hockey team — has turned his attention back to sport, teaming up with a consortium of investors that includes Hollywood star <strong>Michael B Jordan</strong> of the<em> Black Panther </em>and <em>Creed </em>cinematic universes.</p> <p>“Bill doesn't do things by halves,” said <strong>Les Allan</strong>, managing director at Santa Monica-based investment bank <strong>Montminy</strong>, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6e64688-07e2-4a8f-943c-f724b40d9b2a\">advised the club</a> and former owner <strong>Maxim Demin </strong>on the deal.</p> <p>That might be an understatement. Foley hopped on the radio this week <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63982991\">to tell listeners that he's “a dictator”</a> who feels the “need to be the captain of the ship”.&#xa0;</p> <p>One of the most interesting aspects of Foley's foray into English football is price.</p> <p>Bournemouth may be in the Premier League — the world's richest domestic football division by revenues — but £120mn is a far lower entry point than what an investor would pay for a US sports franchise. </p> <p>That's partly because Europe's football leagues include the possibility of relegation, or demotion to a lower division. That's the punishment for poor sporting performance. It's value destructive, if you couldn't guess.</p> <p>Bournemouth — and former owner Demin — know the story all too well. This is the club's first season back in the big time after two seasons in the <strong>Championship</strong>, the second-tier of English football. </p> <p>Foley's purchase was a bargain as far as football clubs are concerned. He'll now need to focus on keeping it that way.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> has hired <strong>Ron van Kemenade</strong>, the tech boss of Dutch banking group <strong>ING</strong>, as its next chief operating officer. He will start in June.</p></li>  <li><p>Swedish battery start-up <strong>Northvolt</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e39bb68-58bb-465d-b11c-4b426640409c\">has named</a> <strong>Jim Hagemann Snabe</strong>, the current chair of <strong>Siemens</strong> and former chief of software company <strong>SAP</strong>, as its next chair.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Numis</strong> has made three hires at its Dublin office: Citi's <strong>Peter Davis </strong>as director of investment banking, <strong>Davy</strong>'s <strong>Cian Fanning</strong> as a director of equity sales, and wealth manager <strong>Goodbody</strong>'s<strong> Rob Fallon </strong>as a director of equity sales trading.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Fried Frank</strong> has named <strong>Andrew Rearick</strong> as a partner in its M&amp;A and private equity practice, based in London. He joins from <strong>Debevoise &amp; Plimpton</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart reads</h1> <p><strong>Collateral damage </strong>Hong Kong had been raring to become Asia's premier hub for digital currencies. The catastrophic collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38cd0fdc-beb0-47dd-a9ef-712435efa645\">couldn't have come at a worse time</a>, the FT's Primrose Riordan writes.</p> <p><strong>Tough crowd </strong>Those opposed to a polarising proposal to merge the two sides of Rupert Murdoch's media empire, News Corp and Fox, have suggested spinning off a lucrative real estate investment held by News Corp, instead. That plan <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-13/murdochs-nwsa-6-8-billion-real-estate-score-is-fuel-for-merger-foes?srnd=deals\">has also garnered critics</a>, Bloomberg reports.</p> <p><strong>‘Lying, lying, lying' </strong>Fallen banking tycoon Sergei Leontiev has positioned himself as a refugee of the Putin regime. But as our FT colleagues attempted to find out why he left, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/60f608b5-ef23-40b2-a931-2eb5d8faf099\">a different story emerged</a>.
