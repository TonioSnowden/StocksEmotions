  "title": "Banking & Finance: Key Credit Suisse Executive Leaves For Role at Baird",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Duksin's departure is the latest in a continuing talent reshuffle among secondary-advisory executives, as rapid growth in the market for secondhand stakes in private capital funds has prompted more banks to launch secondary-advisory businesses. The Wall Street Journal reported in February that Lincoln International had poached UBS Group AG managing directors Steve Carre and Dan Posternak to lead its foray into the space.</p><p>Mr. Duksin will co-lead the Baird unit alongside Alexander Mejia, a former managing director and head of secondary advisory at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the people said. Mr. Mejia left Goldman earlier this year to join Baird, according to a report from trade publication Private Equity International.</p><p>The global co-head of Credit Suisse's Private Fund Group, David Klein, will cover Mr. Duksin's position on an interim basis, according to the people. Credit Suisse's capital solutions unit, which encompasses the bank's secondary-advisory and direct-private-placement businesses, sits within a private fund group that is co-led by Mr. Klein and Michael Murphy.</p><p>Sponsor-led secondary deals typically provide private-equity firms with more time and capital to hold their portfolio companies by transferring one or more of those companies from existing funds to specially formed funds called continuation funds that the private-equity firms continue to manage.</p><p>There were around $68.64 billion in adviser-led continuation fund deals in 2021, up from about $34.8 billion in 2020 and about $26.4 billion in 2019, according to secondary adviser Jefferies Financial Group Inc.</p>",
