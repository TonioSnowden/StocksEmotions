  "text": "<p>French private equity firm Antin Infrastructure Partners soared on its first day of trading as investors bet on a spending boom in wealthier nations.</p> <p>In the biggest initial public offering on Euronext Paris to date this year, Antin, one of Europe's largest infrastructure investment funds, and its founders raised €550m — the latest in a long line of PE groups tapping public markets.</p> <p>Antin's shares were priced at €24, but shot up more than a quarter to €30 in early morning trading on Friday.&#xa0;</p> <p>The infrastructure boom was a “trend which is structural and can only grow”, Alain Rauscher, co-founder and managing partner of Antin, told the Financial Times. </p> <p>“Investments that had been carried out by states are now being carried out by private investors like ourselves.”</p> <p>The Paris-based company's IPO comes amid a spate of PE companies choosing to go public in recent months. In July, Bridgepoint became the first private equity firm to list on the London Stock Exchange since 1994. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs plans to list its alternative asset manager, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fcfccca2-e806-4093-93da-0c952bb7d741\">Petershill Partners</a>, in London. And US private equity firm TPG has appointed banks to work on its IPO as it inches closer to a public listing it has mulled for a decade.</p> <p>“When Bridgepoint came to market, people started thinking this is a crazy sector, this is really appealing,” said Rauscher.</p> <p>This year has proved to be a boon for private equity firms, which had their busiest half-year since records began four decades ago, striking <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd9571a3-726c-4995-9954-23a8dcf12b19\">deals worth $500bn</a>.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Rauscher said he was quite “pessimistic” about the “mind-boggling” amounts of capital being promised by governments waxing lyrical about investing in infrastructure as part of pandemic recovery plans: “It's like old wine in new bottles . . . is it going to be implemented? And if so, when and how?”</p> <p>That, he thinks, will open up space for PE groups to occupy.</p> <p>Antin said it had sold 14.5m shares to raise €350m in capital. About €200m of shares were also sold by the company's executives, with existing partners still maintaining a majority stake, leaving a free float of between 13 and 15 per cent.</p> <p>Formed in 2007, Antin manages four funds that invest in infrastructure in Europe and North America, with a focus on energy and the environment, telecommunications, transportation and social sectors. A fifth fund is due to open next year.</p> <p>The firm has raised approximately €17bn of capital since its creation, with holdings in UK telecoms group CityFibre and UK motorway services operator Roadchef.</p> <p>It expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation to reach €92m this year, down from €132m in 2020. The IPO costs came in at about €16m. Antin's current ebitda margin is 60 per cent.</p> <p>Net income is forecast to reach approximately €60m in 2021, down from €93m last year.</p> <p>JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley acted as joint global co-ordinators and joint bookrunners, while BNP Paribas, Bank of America and Citigroup also acted as joint bookrunners.</p><p>Source: Anna Gross in Paris 2021 'Private equity firm Antin surges after Paris debut' FT.com 24 September.
