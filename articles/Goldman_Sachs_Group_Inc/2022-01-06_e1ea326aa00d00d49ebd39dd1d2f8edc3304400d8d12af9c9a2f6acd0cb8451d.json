  "title": "Hunter Point Capital Picks Up Stake in Iron Park Capital; The firms share a common heritage going back to GSO Capital Partners, now part of Blackstone",
  "text": "<p>Hunter Point makes minority investments in asset managers running private-equity, credit, real-estate and infrastructure funds that invest in midsize businesses in North America, Europe and Asia.</p><p>The deal marks the second investment made by Hunter Point, which was set up in 2020 by Bennett Goodman, a co-founder of GSO, and Avi Kalichstein. In its first deal, Hunter Point bought a stake in MidOcean Partners, a private-equity and credit manager, in November.</p><p>Hunter Point is raising a fund with a target of $2.5 billion, people familiar with the effort said. A representative for the firm declined to comment.</p><p>Tripp Smith, another GSO co-founder, started Iron Park in 2019 to invest in public and private credit opportunities.</p><p>Mr. Smith raised an Iron Park hedge fund called Winter Is Coming to invest in publicly traded bonds, posting a return of more than 57% before closing the fund last year, according to a person familiar with the matter. Iron Park currently runs a $550 million hedge fund.</p><p>In its private credit operation, Iron Park in 2020 established a joint venture with General Atlantic called Atlantic Park to focus on deal financing and helping companies hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. Atlantic Park supports complex mergers and acquisitions and provides structured finance, including senior debt with warrants and preferred equity, as well as rescue capital, a person close to the firm said.</p><p>Iron Park raised $2.2 billion for the debut Atlantic Park fund and is currently seeking $3 billion for the venture's second fund, according to a potential investor familiar with the details. The venture plans to make 15 to 20 investments of around $200 million each through the new fund, this person said. Iron Park representatives declined to comment on the fundraising.</p><p>Hunter Point emerged a winner among a handful of contenders seeking to back Iron Park because of the potential \"value add and thought partnership\" Hunter Point could bring, one person familiar with the matter said. Even though Messrs. Goodman and Smith knew each other, the deal wasn't a \"jotted on a napkin,\" another person said, adding that the related due diligence took more than six months and the final investment agreement is over 150 pages long.</p><p>Several asset managers have concentrated on acquiring minority interests in midmarket-focused private-equity firms that need capital to expand their operations or launch new strategies. Recent examples include Blackstone's investments in Nautic Partners and Great Hill Partners. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Petershill Partners PLC picked up a minority stake in Arlington Capital Partners. Meanwhile, Apollo Asset Management Inc. took a stake in financial-technology investor Motive Partners, joining Capital Constellation as a backer.</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com</p>",
