  "title": "SoftBank Finalizing $4 Billion Loan From Apollo-Led Group; Deal shows Japanese conglomerate's need for cash and Apollo's push into lending",
  "text": "<p>The loan would be secured by SoftBank's second Vision Fund, people familiar with the matter said. That roughly $40 billion potincludes stakes in 150 companies such as Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart; digital-banking startup Revolut; and Cameo, a site where celebritiessell personalized messages.</p><p>The deal shows SoftBank's ravenous need for cash and Apollo's push into lending, a territory traditionally dominated by banks. Using borrowed money to make investments, rather than its own cash, would increase SoftBank's profits if those bets turn out to be winners—and exaggerate losses if they sour.</p><p>SoftBank, whose holdings range from Japanese telecoms to European chip makers to Silicon Valley startups, has tapped its various holdings before to borrow. Last spring, it arranged an $8 billion loan from a group of banks secured by its stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the listed Chinese e-commerce giant.</p><p>The initial Vision Fund, launched in 2016 with about $100 billion, was the biggest pool ever assembled for private investing, and SoftBank spent it at a breakneck pace—on everything from ride-hailing apps including Uber Technologies Inc. to indoor-farming startups and artificial-intelligence companies. It famously bet big on WeWork Inc., the co-working company that flamed out before its eventual listing.</p><p>The sequel fund was to be even bigger, but outside investors stayed away, disillusioned by bad bets such as WeWork and the chaotic waythe Vision Fund had operated. SoftBank instead had to rely on its own cash to make investments.</p><p>That cash has been in shorter supply. In November, SoftBank reported a $3.5 billion quarterly loss, hurt by China's crackdown on tech companies. Its stake in Chinese ride-hailing company Didi, for which it paid $12 billion, was valued at $7.5 billion. The stake in Alibaba, its largest holding, has declined by half over the past year. \"We are in the middle of a blizzard,\" SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son told reporters.</p><p>The firm also pledged to spend at least $9 billion buying back its own shares, which have lost about half their value since February. That buyback is on top of a $20 billion share-repurchase program completed earlier this year.</p><p>As of the end of September, SoftBank valued the second Vision Fund at $38 billion. Several of its holdings have recently gone public, including Chinese grocery startup DingDong Ltd. and robotics company AutoStore Holdings Ltd.</p><p>Apollo and its insurance affiliate, Athene Holding Ltd., will lead the SoftBank loan and will be joined by a group of investors including mutual funds, endowments and financial institutions, one of the people said.</p><p>Providing big loans is increasingly of interest to asset managers and private-equity firms. Last year, Apollo leda $4 billion bankruptcy loan for Hertz Global Holdings Inc. in partnership with Athene. In October, executives said Apollo was on track to make 30 loans of over $1 billion this year, up from one in 2019.</p><p>Apollo, which expects to complete a deal in January to buy the piece of Athene it doesn't already own, needs a constant supply of new debt deals in which to invest the insurer's assets.</p><p>On Monday, Athene said it would buy a company that finances clean-energy projects at commercial properties, the latest in a string of similar deals for lending businesses it has struck this year. This summer, Apollo was the runner-up bidder for GreenSky LLC, a home-improvement and medical lender that is being sold to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Write to Liz Hoffman at liz.hoffman@wsj.com and Miriam Gottfried at Miriam.Gottfried@wsj.com</p><p>SoftBank Finalizing $4 Billion Loan From Apollo-Led Group</p>",
