  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Goldman  Hires  McKinsey  Veteran  ----  By Orla McCaffrey",
  "text": "<p>   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. named Kevin Sneader to help run its operations in Asia, months after he was voted out as the leader of consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. </p><p>   Mr. Sneader will serve as co-president of the Asia business, excluding Japan, alongside Todd Leland. He will also join the firm's management committee and relocate to Hong Kong. </p><p>   The pair is charged with expanding the Wall Street firm's client base in the region, where Goldman has outlined ambitious expansion plans. Chinese regulators in May approved Goldman's plan to build a wealth-management venture in the country with one of its largest banks, Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China Ltd. </p><p>   The Asia Pacific region accounted for about $6.2 billion, or 14%, of the bank's revenue in 2020. About 9% of Goldman's corporate loans last year were issued to businesses in the region. </p><p>   Mr. Sneader spent 32 years at McKinsey, his final three as global managing partner. In February, partners at the consulting firm voted to replace him -- a move seen as a rebuke of his management of a string of scandals involving McKinsey and their ensuing legal settlements. It was the first time in decades a McKinsey leader hadn't won a second term. </p><p>   Some partners chafed at Mr. Sneader's efforts to move McKinsey away from a culture in which partners were given wide latitude over their work and clients to a more rule-bound, process-oriented one. </p><p>   Goldman last year admitted wrongdoing and agreed to pay billions of dollars to global regulators to end a yearslong investigation into its dealings with a Malaysian investment fund. </p><p></p>",
