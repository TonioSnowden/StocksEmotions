  "text": "<p>This isn't a new theme, but the current political and market instability is presumably making the issue harder to ignoreâ€”especially for a Chinese administration that has made self-sufficiency a key economic plank.</p><p>Prices of wheat and corn have skyrocketed in recent weeks as the market eyes supply disruptions from the war. Ukraine, sometimes known as the breadbasket of Europe, is a major producer of the crops. Together with Russia, the two countries account for 28% of global wheat exports and 16% of corn exports, according to UBS.</p><p>The direct impact on China should be manageable. China imports around 7% to 10% of its wheat and corn, according to Goldman Sachs. Such imports have jumped in recent years, partly because the country has been filling up its strategic reserves. China's grain reserves are at a historically high level, state media reported in November. They could probably be used to soften the blow.</p><p>There could be secondary impacts that drive up food prices further in the coming months. Fertilizer prices, which were already surging due to the pandemic, may go higher as Russia is also a major exporter. Producers of nitrogen fertilizers, in particular, could see their costs rise since they use natural gas as a key ingredient. Supply shortages of sunflower oil, of which Ukraine is a major exporter, may drive up prices for alternatives such as soybean oil. The latter is important as China imports more than 80% of what it consumes. Soy is also critical as feed for pigs, the country's main source of meat protein.</p><p>This isn't the only recent food security scare for China: the 2018 and 2019 trade war with the U.S. also highlighted China's vulnerability. But boosting domestic crop output might be easier said than done. Urbanization has driven labor to cities and reduced arable land. The country needs better technology to improve crop yields. That probably entails use of GM foods: China has been revamping its regulations on that in recent months. Scarce water, particularly in the north, is another intractable problem.</p><p>Improving agricultural productivity was probably the main rationale for state-owned chemical company ChemChina's $43 billion acquisition in 2017 of Swiss seed and pesticide company Syngenta, which is in the process of an initial public offering in Shanghai. But the other heavyweight GMO companies are mostly American and European such as Monsanto, Dow, BASF and DuPont. China will hope to groom its own homemade champion, but that would take time and investment.</p><p>How to feed its 1.4 billion people in a more politically unstable world will increasingly become a key task for Beijing. But self-sufficiency is a tricky beast, as both the Sino-U.S. trade conflict and Russia's current travails are demonstrating.</p><p>Write to Jacky Wong at jacky.wong@wsj.com</p><p>Ukraine Conflict Triggers China's Food Insecurities</p>",
