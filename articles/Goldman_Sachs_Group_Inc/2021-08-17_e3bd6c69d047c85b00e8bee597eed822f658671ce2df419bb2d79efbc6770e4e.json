  "text": "<p>   BEIJING -- China's economy slowed more than expected in July as extreme weather and the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus swept across the country, adding more strains to a recovery that was already plateauing more than a year after the pandemic first exploded. </p><p>   Monthly indicators of industrial, consumption and investment activity showed growth retreating more quickly than expected -- and decelerating from June's yearly growth rates -- according to data released Monday by China's National Bureau of Statistics. </p><p>   The numbers come after economists and research firms had begun lowering growth expectations, as signs of slowing momentum collide with renewed concerns around the impact of pandemic restrictions. </p><p>   The data included two key contributors to the headline gross domestic product figure: industrial production, which rose 6.4% from a year earlier, and fixed-asset investment, up 10.3% in the first seven months of the year from the year-ago period. Both rates of increase fell short of expectations, and marked a slowdown from June's growth rates. </p><p>   The story was even more disappointing with respect to domestic consumption, another major contributor to the GDP figure and one that was already lagging far behind the industrial and export sectors. Retail sales growth slowed to 8.5% in July compared with a year earlier, a pullback from June's 12.1% increase. </p><p>   China's headline jobless rate, the surveyed urban unemployment rate, rose to 5.1% in July, up from 5.0% in June. </p><p>   \"Growth in some consumer sectors and services slowed,\" Fu Linghui, a statistics bureau spokesman said, pointing in particular to parts of central China that have been affected by flooding. Mr. Fu said growth in the second half was likely to be lower than in the first. </p><p>   In recent weeks, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Nomura, among other large investment banks, had reduced their forecasts for China's full-year growth -- to around 8.2% or 8.3%, from 8.6% to 8.9%. </p><p>   Economists are divided on whether policy makers will support the economy. Even with the disappointing figures, China is projected to be comfortably on pace to exceed its full-year growth target of 6% or more. In the first half of 2021, China's economy grew 12.7% compared with the year-earlier period. </p><p>   One key question is how quickly authorities are able to control the outbreak of the Delta variant, which has resulted in the shutdown of a major port and led to broader travel restrictions across the country since it first appeared about a month ago. </p><p></p>",
