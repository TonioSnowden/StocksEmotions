Lael Brainard will testify on Thursday in front of the same Senate panel, as she aims to succeed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who will step down on Friday, two weeks earlier than expected after becoming embroiled in a controversy involving a stock transaction in 2020.</p><p>Later in the day, Kansas City Fed President Esther&#xa0;George and St. Louis Fed President James&#xa0;Bullard are also expected to deliver speeches.</p><p>Market expectations for a series of rate increases in 2022 have been growing.</p><p>Deutsche Bank's economists said that they expect four hikes in 2022, starting in March, and Goldman Sachs Groupeconomists raised their forecast for 2022 rate increases,&#xa0;to four from three as the Fed wrangles with inflation.</p><p>On Wednesday, investors will watch for a report on inflation, the consumer-price index, which is expected to show a 7.1% headline year-over year figure for December, which would be the highest level in four decades.&#xa0;</p><p>Looking ahead, an auction of $52 billion in 3-year notes BX:TMUBMUSD03Y is set for 1 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>What strategists are saying</p><p>“More relevant will be Powell's testimony this morning. His prepared remarks include the observation that ‘we can begin to see that the post-pandemic economy is likely to be different in some respects. The pursuit of our goals will need to take these differences into account. To that end, monetary policy must take a broad and forward-looking view, keeping pace with an ever-evolving economy.' The implication being that the realities of the post-pandemic real economy warrant a monetary policy response sooner than might have otherwise been the case had the new normal more closely resembled the old one,” wrote BMO Capital Markets strategists Ian Lyngen and Ben Jeffery.</p>",
