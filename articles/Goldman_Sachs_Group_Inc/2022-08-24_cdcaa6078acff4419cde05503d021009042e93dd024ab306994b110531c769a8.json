  "text": "<p>In a race seen as an early test of Democrats' efforts to use the issue of abortion access to motivate their base in competitive contests, Democrat Pat Ryan defeated Republican Marc Molinaro in a special election to fill an open House seat in New York's Hudson Valley, the Associated Press projected.</p><p>In New York City, Democrats poured their energy into primary contests for the 10th and 12th districts. Longtime Reps. Nadler and Maloney found themselves facing off when they were drawn together in the 12th District, which includes Midtown Manhattan and the areas surrounding Central Park.</p><p>Another incumbent, freshman Rep. Mondaire Jones, was in danger of being ousted from Congress after being pushed into the 10th District, covering Manhattan and Brooklyn. Dan Goldman, a former federal prosecutor who also served as lead counsel in Mr. Trump's first impeachment, held a slight lead over Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou. Mr. Jones was in third.</p><p>Mr. Goldman, an heir to the Levi Strauss &amp; Co. fortune, has lent his campaign several million dollars and has outspent his rivals.</p><p>Following redistricting, Mr. Jones scrapped plans to seek re-election from his Westchester County home when a more senior member, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, said he would run there. Mr. Maloney, who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, won his primary race against state Sen. Alessandra Biaggi.</p><p>In Oklahoma, Rep. Markwayne Mullin won a Republican primary runoff in the race to fill the remainder of the term of retiring Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe. Mr. Mullin defeated T.W. Shannon, who was the first Black person to serve as state House speaker.</p><p>Mr. Mullin will take on former Democratic Rep. Kendra Horn in a special election this fall in the deep red state. Mr. Inhofe, who plans to retire in early January, was elected to a six-year term in 2020.</p><p>In an Oklahoma Democratic primary, Madison Horn beat Jason Bollinger to be the party's candidate against incumbent Republican Sen. James Lankford in the fall.</p><p>All New York primaries were originally scheduled for June 28, but the congressional and state Senate contests were moved to August after a judge struck down Democratic-drawn district lines.</p><p>There is no tradition of August voting in the state, and its early-voting numbers lagged behind the June primary, when primaries for governor, lieutenant governor and state Assembly took place.</p><p>In the Hudson Valley's 19th District, Mr. Ryan, a Democrat, held a narrow lead over the GOP's Mr. Molinaro in a contest to fill the term of former Rep. Antonio Delgado.</p><p>Mr. Ryan, the Ulster County executive, aired ads touting his support for abortion access after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in June. Mr. Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, said abortion policy should be left to states and has said he personally opposes abortion.</p><p>The seat opened up when Gov. Kathy Hochul appointed Mr. Delgado as lieutenant governor when the previous holder of that office, Brian Benjamin, resigned after h ewas charged with bribery. Mr. Benjamin has pleaded not guilty.</p><p>The other special election was to serve out the term of former GOP Rep. Tom Reed, who canceled his re-election efforts after apologizing for inappropriate sexual conduct, and later resigned. Republican Joe Sempolinski defeated Democrat Max Della Pia.</p><p>---</p><p>Joshua Jamerson and Arian Campo-Flores contributed to this article.New York 19th Congressional District</p>",
