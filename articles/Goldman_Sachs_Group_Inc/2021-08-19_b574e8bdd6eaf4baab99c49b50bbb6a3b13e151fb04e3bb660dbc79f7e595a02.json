  "title": "Goldman Sachs/NN: recurring income inspires steady relationship",
  "text": "<p>Some Wall Street companies yearn to swap the hurly-burly of investment banking for the deep, deep peace of asset management — or at least experience more of the latter. Goldman Sachs announced on Thursday its largest acquisition yet under boss David Solomon, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd064398-2030-4260-84e3-f442d42cd2d1\">taking on NN Investment Partners</a> for €1.6bn ($1.9bn). No racy alternatives specialist, NNIP specialises in fixed income, mostly for its Dutch insurance parent NN Group. </p> <p>The deal gives Goldman Sachs Asset Management a European beachhead, as media was quick to point out. Recurring income probably matters as much.</p> <p>The purchase adds $355bn to GSAM's assets, lifting the total to $2.6tn. That will hardly deflect the stylus for Solomon, whose sideline as a DJ this column, like every other, is professionally obliged to mention whenever possible.</p> <p>NNIP only earned about €65m ($76.5m) in the first half of this year after taxes. Compare that with GSAM's $4.8bn. NNIP generated an average of just 16 basis points from its clients, partly because three-quarters of its funds specialise in fixed income, usually lower rent.</p> <p>Scale is what NNIP lacked. But what does Goldman get in return? The Dutch fund manager has expertise in responsible investment, especially in the proliferating area of green bonds. More important, having agreed a continuing long-term relationship with the insurance parent NN Group, Goldman is buying recurring revenues. </p> <p>Two-thirds of NNIP's client assets come from the insurance group. And, yes, NN Group should offer useful distribution for alternative products Goldman can now market in Europe. GSAM claims top ranking in managed assets for insurers globally at $550bn.</p> <p>Investors in financial services prize recurring revenues, says Christian Bolu of Autonomous. Alternative asset managers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d85c0a3-8f52-4b43-8fa7-36c0391562de\">Blackstone and KKR</a>, with their high and steady fees, trade well above Goldman's 1.4 times price to book ratio. So does rival Morgan Stanley, which has a big wealth management business, at 1.9 times. </p> <p>Solomon knows that dad dancing trumps investment banking's volatile moves. The latter depressed Goldman's valuation until recently. For Goldman, a deal of this size is hardly transformational. But it shows the bank retains its appetite for diversification, even after the recent purple patch in trading and deal making.</p> <p><em>Lex recommends the FT's Due Diligence newsletter, a curated briefing on the world of mergers and acquisitions.
