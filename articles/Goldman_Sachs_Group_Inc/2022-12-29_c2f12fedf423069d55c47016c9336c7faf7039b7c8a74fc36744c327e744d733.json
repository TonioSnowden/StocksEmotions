  "title": "George Santos: What to Know About the Controversy Surrounding the Congressman-Elect; New York Republican faces questions on finances after admitting to falsifying his résumé",
  "text": "<p>What is the controversy over Mr. Santos's personal and family history?</p><p>Mr. Santos has said he was born in Queens, N.Y., to Brazilian parents and has dual U.S.-Brazilian citizenship. He said his father's parents were Brazilian and his mother's family was Jewish and had fled persecution in Europe. Public records, however, indicate his mother's parents were born in Brazil, not Europe. Mr. Santos has said that his understanding of his maternal grandparents' history and religion came from family stories.</p><p>Mr. Santos has been disinvited from any future events put on by the Republican Jewish Coalition over what it said were misrepresentations he made to the group about his Jewish heritage. Mr. Santos had embraced both a Jewish and Catholic identity in published interviews and at events. He referred to himself as a \"proud American Jew\" in a campaign document, and top Republicans had hailed him as adding to the ranks of Jewish Republicans in Congress.</p><p>In published interviews, however, Mr. Santos said that he was Catholic and that he never said he was Jewish. \"Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was 'Jew-ish,'\" the New York Post reported.</p><p>There are also questions about time he spent in Brazil when he was younger. The New York Times reported that while in Brazil in 2008, he used checks of a deceased client of his mother to buy gifts for a friend. The Wall Street Journal viewed court documents that confirmed Mr. Santos was accused of committing fraud in 2008. Mr. Santos had denied that he committed any crimes.</p><p>\"I committed absolutely no crimes,\" Mr. Santos told City &amp; State. \"I'm not a wanted criminal in any jurisdiction.\"</p><p>In 2015 and 2017, landlords filed eviction notices against Mr. Santos, the New York Times reported. Mr. Santos told the Post that he didn't pay his rent because his family had medical debt related to his mother's battle with cancer. The Wall Street Journal confirmed that his mother died in 2016 in New York.</p><p>\"We had issues paying rent at the time. It's the vulnerability of being human. I am not embarrassed by it,\" Mr. Santos told the Post. \"We didn't pay it off. I completely forgot about it.\"</p><p>What are the concerns with Mr. Santos's résumé?</p><p>Mr. Santos said during the campaign that he graduated from Baruch College in Manhattan and had worked at financial-services firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. before making an earlier bid for Congress in 2020. There is, however, no record of his attending Baruch or working at either Goldman Sachs or Citigroup, and Mr. Santos admitted he lied about his education and work history.</p><p>\"I'm embarrassed and sorry for having embellished my résumé,\" Mr. Santos told the Post.</p><p>How did Mr. Santos make his money?</p><p>Some Democrats have called for an investigation into Mr. Santos's rapid wealth gain between 2020 and 2022. Campaign-finance forms filed by Mr. Santos during his unsuccessful bid for Congress in 2020 and his successful 2022 run show he amassed wealth in the two-year period between the campaigns.</p><p>In the 2020 campaign, Mr. Santos declared no major assets and listed a commission bonus from LinkBridge Investors as the only compensation over $5,000, according to a filing with the House clerk.</p><p>Two years later, his disclosure filing said he was managing principal of the Devolder Organization, which is described as a consulting company. He claimed a $750,000 salary and assets including an apartment in Rio de Janeiro valued at up to $1 million and checking and savings accounts totaling at least $1.1 million. He listed income earned from salary and dividends from the Devolder Organization of at least $3.5 million for the period spanning 2021 and 2022.</p><p>In an interview with Semafor, Mr. Santos said that he was paid for \"capital introduction.\" He said an example of his work would be to connect buyers and sellers of airplanes or boats. Mr. Santos said he left LinkBridge to go to Harbor City Capital before leaving in March 2021 to go on his own with the Devolder Organization, a reference to his full name, George Anthony Devolder Santos. In April 2021, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Harbor City of an alleged Ponzi scheme in which investor funds were used to fund personal items including property and a Mercedes-Benz as well as to pay out other investors. The complaint didn't name Mr. Santos.</p><p>Devolder was dissolved in September of this year but was reinstated in December, one day after the New York Times reported on questions in Mr. Santos's biography.</p><p>Will he be sworn into Congress?</p><p>Mr. Santos is set to be seated as a member of Congress on Jan. 3 unless he decides to resign. The Supreme Court has said that the House can only prevent candidates from taking office if they violate the Constitution's age, citizenship and state residency requirements.</p><p>\"I am not a fraud; I am not a fake,\" Mr. Santos said on Fox News. \"I remain committed in delivering results for the American people.\"</p><p>House Republicans will have the majority in the House next year, and it will be up to them to decide on any potential investigations. The House Ethics Committee, which is split equally between Republicans and Democrats, must decide whether to investigate a member. No committees will be formed until after the House is in session next week and members choose the speaker. Expulsion from the House is rare and would require support from two-thirds of House lawmakers.</p><p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) hasn't responded to requests for comment. Mr. McCarthy is vying to be House speaker in the new Congress and is working to wrangle enough votes to be elected to the post.</p><p>Jimmy Vielkind and Jan Wolfe contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Natalie Andrews at natalie.andrews@wsj.com, Eliza Collins at eliza.collins@wsj.com and Luciana Magalhaes at luciana.magalhaes@wsj.com</p><p>George Santos: What to Know About the Controversy Surrounding the Congressman-Elect</p>",
