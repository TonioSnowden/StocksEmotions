  "text": "<p>Furniture retailer Made.com joins the London market today with a value of just £775m having priced its flotation at the bottom of the expected range. </p> <p>The company said it had sold the new shares at 200p apiece to raise gross proceeds of £100m, about half of which will go to existing shareholders. Made.com had last week put a target of between 200p and 265p on its share sale, with the top of the range equating to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fddfaa4d-6323-4ce5-88b9-23cbe5ff540d\">£1bn market value</a>.</p> <p>“A listing in London, where the business was founded, will enable us to accelerate our growth as we lead the development of the online furniture and homewares market as it moves online, both in the UK and internationally,” said Philippe Chainieux, Made.com chief executive.</p> <p>An overallotment option over 14.5m shares for market stabilisation purposes will, if exercised in full, give the company a free float of 29 per cent. </p> <p>Made.com was founded in the UK in 2010 and began <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c75e9bc-2a19-11e9-88a4-c32129756dd8\">expanding into Europe</a> five years later. In the year to December 2019 it achieved sales of £212m, an increase of 22 per cent from the previous year, and a £18.7m operating loss.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Sofa retailer <strong>ScS</strong> said a strong trading performance since reopening meant it expects the full year performance for the year ending July&#xa0;to be ahead of market expectations. The company restarted dividends and said that, given its robust balance sheet and the strength of the current order book, the outlook for the 2022 financial year is also substantially better than current market forecasts.</p> <p><strong>Best of the Best</strong>, which sells raffle tickets for high-value items such as cars, reported a surge in earnings after switching to a digital-only sales model. The company posted a £14m pre-tax profit for the year ended April, up from £4.2m the year before, on revenue up 157 per cent to £45.7m. William Hindmarch, CEO, cautioned that the company had seen “somewhat of a reduction in customer engagement since the latest easing of lockdown restrictions”.</p> <p><strong>Hipgnosis</strong>, the music royalties fund, has launched a share placing aimed at raising £150m for buying more songbooks. It priced the new shares at 121p apiece, a 2.4 per cent discount to Tuesday's closing value. </p> <p><strong>Tullow Oil</strong> said production to the end of May has been in line with expectations at about 62,000 barrels a day.</p> <p><strong>N Brown</strong> said that Allianz Insurance has sought to increase the scope of a customer redress claim tied to the sale of historical insurance products at a possible cost of up to £36m. The mail order retailer said it was not possible to estimate its potential total liability from the complex legal claim and counterclaim with Allianz. </p> <p>BlackRock, JPMorgan and Nationwide Building Society are among the investors in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b24fb14-ba0f-4cde-9a1f-693c5cff71b1\">banking platform fintech</a> <strong>10x Future Technologies</strong>, led by ex-Barclays chief Antony Jenkins. Fund manager BlackRock and CPP Investments, Canada's largest pension fund, co-led a $187m investment in the company, along with existing backers. Jenkins founded 10x in 2016 after being ousted from Barclays the previous year.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <p>Fuel cell developer <strong>Ceres Power</strong> said it has appointed <strong>Professor Dame Julia King</strong>, Baroness Brown of Cambridge, as a non-executive director with immediate effect. King is chair of The Carbon Trust, having previously worked for Rolls-Royce and Imperial College.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Credit Suisse</strong> is preparing its first insurance claims on losses stemming from its $10bn of funds tied to collapsed finance group Greensill Capital, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cb03387-9b16-4fd7-a997-6f34d4c4658a\">according to people with knowledge of the process</a>. The Swiss bank is trying to recoup billions of dollars owed to the group of supply-chain finance funds, which it was forced to close in March. </p> <p>Executives from <strong>Vitol</strong>, <strong>Glencore</strong>, <strong>Trafigura</strong> and <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> told the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://commodities.live.ft.com/\">FT Commodities Global Summit</a>&#xa0;on Tuesday that a return to $100-a-barrel oil was a real possibility, as investment in new supplies slows down before demand has peaked and before green alternatives can take up the slack. Oil has not traded above $100 a barrel since 2014, when a surge in supplies from the US shale sector brought the&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3650c8f-70a2-4f86-a648-9dc0b4434348\">last so-called supercycle</a>&#xa0;to an end. <em>You can register to watch the second day of the conference </em><a href=\"https://commodities.live.ft.com/page/1734025/register-now\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p> <p>Goldman&#xa0;Sachs has led the pack this week in demanding its staff return to the office. But the pace at which employees in <strong>the banking industry</strong> are expected to return varies significantly depending on the lender and its location, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e7761ee-b7a2-48f2-9226-fe20277c2498\">according to a Financial Times analysis</a> of 20 global banks based on internal memos, responses from spokespeople and others briefed on their plans.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Brooke Masters</strong> Things cannot continue the way they are at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b7a3f4d7-8e4e-489a-bb5e-2924977a744f\">Toshiba</a>, the 145-year-old Japanese conglomerate. Investors have another chance to show Japan what it means to put shareholders first at next week's AGM.</p> <p><strong>Elizabeth Uviebinene </strong>In the last year there has been more onus on businesses to be outspoken on issues such as gender equality, racism and climate change. Therefore <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c042ee1-f321-49cd-a586-e1fb29cf9027\">to ban talk of these issues</a> within the workplace is alarming and highlights a much wider point: many workplaces are ill-equipped to deal with intergenerational and multicultural workforces.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Made.com makes its London debut' FT.com 16 June.
