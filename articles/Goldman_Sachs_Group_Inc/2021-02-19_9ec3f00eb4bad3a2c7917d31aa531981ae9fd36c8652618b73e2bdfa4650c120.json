  "title": "Banking & Finance: Charges Drag Down Credit Suisse --- Bank posts quarterly loss but touts strong start to year from fees, underwriting of SPACs",
  "text": "<p>Even in a difficult year, Credit Suisse fared better than many European rivals because its lending in Switzerland and to the global rich held up in the pandemic. Along with Wall Street competitors, its investment bank booked bumper fees from clients trading in last year's gyrating markets and from companies raising capital or needing deal advice.</p><p>On Thursday, it said its investment banking arm saw a more than five-fold jump in pretax profit to $318 million in the fourth quarter, with the biggest revenue contribution coming from helping companies raise stock and bond financing.</p><p>Fourth-quarter pretax profit also rose in Credit Suisse's Asia-Pacific division, by 18% to 237 million Swiss francs, while revenue and pretax profit fell at its Swiss bank and international wealth management unit.</p><p>It was a tumultuous year for Switzerland's second-largest bank by assets, after rival UBS Group AG. In February, its board ousted Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam over a spying scandal and replaced him with bank veteran Thomas Gottstein. A prominent client in China, Luckin Coffee Inc., disclosed a potential accounting fraud in April, while another alleged fraud, at Germany's Wirecard AG in June, put a spotlight on a $1 billion lifeline Credit Suisse that arranged.</p><p>The fourth-quarter loss came because of an $850 million legal charge that the bank announced in December for toxic securities sales before the 2008 financial crisis. It had also flagged a $450 million write-down on the value of a stake in investment manager York Capital Management.</p><p>Taking the charges was \"the right thing to do in my first year, to address some of these historic situations,\" Mr. Gottstein said Thursday. He said the bank has a better platform now for 2021 and saw \"solid momentum in the first six weeks in all four divisions.\"</p><p>A highlight, Mr. Gottstein said, has been a bulging pipeline for special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, which raise cash on exchanges to buy companies and take them public. Credit Suisse was the top SPAC underwriter last year, competing with the likes of Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on those deals and in other Wall Street businesses.</p><p>He said gaining more clients and revenue from private banking remains the bank's main focus. One of his first strategic moves, in July, was to chisel out costs in the investment bank for reinvestment in Asia's fast-growing wealth markets and private banking more generally.</p><p>Across the bank, net profit for the full year was 2.67 billion Swiss francs, equivalent to $2.97 billion.</p><p>Despite settling some big cases, litigation and regulatory issues hang over the bank. The Swiss financial regulator opened enforcement proceedings into controls around the bank's employee spying in September, and Swiss federal prosecutors criminally charged it in December with failing to prevent money laundering by a Bulgarian criminal organization and an employee. Credit Suisse said it is cooperating with the regulator on its proceedings, and it denies the allegations in the federal criminal charges.</p>",
