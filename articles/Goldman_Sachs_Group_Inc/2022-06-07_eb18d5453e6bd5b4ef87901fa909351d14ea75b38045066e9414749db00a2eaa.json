  "text": "<p>* West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery CL.1 CL00 CLN22 fell 40 cents, or 0.3%, to $118.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p><p>* August Brent crude BRN00 BRNQ22, the global benchmark, was down 42 cents, or 0.4%, at $119.09 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.</p><p>* Back on Nymex, July gasoline RBN22 fell 2.1% to $4.1046 a gallon, continuing a pullback after ending Friday at a record. July heating oil HON22 was off 0.8% at $4.3231 a gallon.</p><p>* July natural gas NGN22 was up 1.8% at $9.49 per million British thermal units after posting its highest finish since Aug. 1, 2008, on Monday.</p><p>Market drivers</p><p>Crude oil prices have pulled back from around three-month highs, but remain supported as demand revives with China ending COVID-19 lockdowns and as concerns remain over tight supplies given sanctions and embargoes are seen taking Russian crude off the market.</p><p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs, in a Tuesday note, said that a \"political\" surplus created in April and May as a result of only modest Russian export declines, massive releases from strategic oil reserves by several countries, and China's COVID-19 lockdowns is already ending.</p><p>They forecast that Brent will need to average $135 a barrel in the second half of 2022 and first half of 2023, up $10 a barrel from their previous forecast, for inventories to normalize by late 2023.</p><p>Meanwhile, a decision last week by OPEC+ — the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies — to increase output did little to cool crude prices. OPEC+ agreed to raise its output target by 648,000 barrels a day in July and August, up from the 432,000 barrel-a-day increments it had previously delivered. But OPEC+ has failed to meet its production targets recently, analysts have noted, and doubt the group's ability to meet the larger target.</p><p>Natural-gas futures, meanwhile, have surged, boosted by forecasts for hotter-than-normal weather over much of the U.S.</p><p>Oil prices consolidate after testing $120 a barrel</p>",
