  "text": "<p>Dr Martens, the classic British boot brand, plans to float on the London Stock Exchange in what would be one of the first big initial public offerings of 2021. </p> <p>The company, which sells more than 11m pairs of shoes every year in more than 60 countries, agreed to be <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e47cdfc-3c98-11e3-86ef-00144feab7de\">taken over</a> in 2013 by private equity group Permira for £300m. The investment group, which owns about 75 per cent of Dr Martens, plans to float at least 25 per cent of the company.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The brand name has always been much bigger than the business, but in the past years we have taken the business to a completely different level,” Kenny Wilson, the bootmaker's chief executive, told the Financial Times.</p> <p>Dr Martens, which has expanded to sell loafers and heels, made sales of £672m in the year to March 2020 and pre-tax profits of £101m. The group has 130 stores around the world but just over half of revenues come from selling shoes to other retailers. </p> <p>Its online shop, which it expects will be “the main driver of growth over the coming years”, accounted for a fifth of sales last year. The brand's digital operation helped it during the pandemic despite the majority of its stores being closed for months on end during successive lockdowns.</p> <p>Dr Martens said it sold 700,000 more boots in the six months to the end of September compared with the same period last year, an increase of 14 per cent. During this time, when most of its physical shops were closed, online revenues jumped 74 per cent.</p> <p>The brand was brought to the British high street in the 1960s by the Griggs family, which snapped up the licence for the now iconic 1460 eight-eyelet boots thinking the sturdy design would make an excellent work shoe. </p> <p>Instead the model, created by a German army doctor called Klaus Märtens&#xa0;who designed the air-cushioned sole to help relieve back pain, was adopted by skinheads and punks, cementing the shoe as a symbol for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c72c2578-55c1-11e7-80b6-9bfa4c1f83d2\">rebellious youth culture</a>.</p> <p>But it has not always been smooth sailing — changing fashion tastes at the turn of the millennium brought the company close to bankruptcy before the boots' popularity picked up again.</p> <p>“It was family-owned seven years ago [and] when you look at the ups and downs it is like looking at different companies,” said Mr Wilson. “The brand was always relevant, it was just a badly managed business,” he added.</p> <p>The Griggs family left the company in 2013 when it sold its stake to Permira. The company has for much of the past year been mulling a sale or a listing of the company, which executives at the buyout group hope could become one of its most successful deals. </p> <p>Private equity group Carlyle, which sold the premium sneaker business Golden Goose to Permira for just under €1.3bn in February, has previously considered buying Dr Martens, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>Dr Martens has hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as joint coordinators and Barclays, HSBC, Merrill Lynch and RBC Europe as bookrunners. Lazard is acting as a financial adviser to the company.</p><p>Source: Patricia Nilsson, Kaye Wiggins and Oliver Ralph 2021 'Dr Martens owner Permira plans IPO of cult bootmaker ' FT.com 11 January.
