And it would bring CVC into line with US giants that have long since made the shift. </p> <p>But on the flipside: it would bring public scrutiny to a business that has long avoided the limelight. And it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86ce59dc-8625-4000-a52f-603046354d19\">threatens to erode the high-risk, high-reward culture</a> that CVC has prized, DD's Kaye Wiggins and Arash Massoudi write. </p> <p>At CVC, winners reap the rewards and losers suffer. Roughly a third of its profits are handed out to a small group of its savviest dealmakers — but if their deals go wrong, they are financially on the hook. </p> <p>Advocates criticise what they see as a “heads I win, tails you lose” model at rival firms, where the rewards are pooled more widely so that one dealmaker's success can offset another's problems. If dealmakers are putting pension funds' money at risk, they say, they themselves should be on the hook when things go wrong. </p> <p>We can now reveal a guide of how that works in practice. Here's how a hypothetical star buyout would lead to deal teams getting paid: </p> <p>And here's a breakdown of the returns on CVC's funds:</p> <p>CVC began gearing up for an Amsterdam listing at the start of the year. That has been on hold since Russia's invasion of Ukraine derailed markets. But it's coming back, insiders insist. The only question is when. </p> <p>It is not a good time to list almost any company, let alone a private equity firm. Shares in listed rivals<strong> Bridgepoint </strong>and<strong> EQT </strong>are down more than 50 per cent this year. &#xa0;</p> <p>The IPO will place more scrutiny on the firm, which is still almost entirely male-dominated. Of 34 managing partners and co-founders at CVC, just one is female: <strong>Cathrin Petty</strong>, who joined from <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> in 2016. </p> <p>But if CVC wants to modernise, it may ultimately have to take the plunge next year. </p> <p>“I haven't met anyone who's ever said, ‘I'm so glad I'm public,'” said one insider. But “if you want CVC to grow up and have the tools other private equity firms have . . . it would be nice to know the next generation is going to have that”.</p> <h1>Unilever's ice cream empire drips with controversy</h1> <p><strong>The Simon Wiesenthal Center</strong>, named for the famed Nazi hunter, is not known for its involvement with consumer goods brands.</p> <p>Yet the organisation is among many to have become involved in the ice cream war surrounding Vermont-based<strong> Ben &amp; Jerry's</strong> since the dessert maker attempted in 2021 to stop selling Phish Food, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough and its other popular flavours in the occupied Palestinian territories.</p> <p>As well as prompting the Jewish human rights group to take out ads condemning “anti-Semitic ice cream”, the move by Ben &amp; Jerry's sparked fury from the Israeli government, a series of US pension funds and its parent company, <strong>Unilever</strong>, against which it has now taken legal action.</p> <p>The rift between the brand and its parent company is all the more noteworthy because both place ethics at the heart of their public image, the FT's Judith Evans reports in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/30efd993-8c23-4f1b-9385-132bbba3d863\">this Big Read</a>.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/11427396.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Unilever is a darling of ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds, and its chief executive <strong>Alan Jope </strong>threatened near the beginning of his tenure to sell off brands that did not “stand for something more important than just making your hair shiny, your skin soft, your clothes whiter or your food tastier”.</p> <p>His response to Ben &amp; Jerry's, however, might be summed up as “no, not like that”. The legal action concerns a move by Unilever to sell the ice cream brand's Israeli arm to its local licensee with just a few days' notice, enabling him to continue selling into Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.</p> <p>The company will not be the last to face such a dilemma as groups face growing pressure to take public stances on sensitive issues.</p> <p>And the rift may outlive Jope's tenure. Last month he announced he would retire as chief executive at the end of 2023.</p> <p>His departure is just one of the changes on the way at Unilever after it appointed the activist investor<strong> Nelson Peltz</strong> to its board — a well-known figure with a history of overhauling consumer companies who also chairs the board of governors at the Simon Wiesenthal Center.</p> <h1>Todd Boehly bets on the jet set</h1> <p>Some of Wall Street's top dealmakers earn their money buying boring industrial companies that no one has ever heard of. Billionaire <strong>Todd Boehly</strong> isn't one of them.</p> <p>His investment portfolio includes a growing stockpile of trophy assets and high-end luxuries only the wealthiest financiers can afford to appreciate.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Boehly found a way to take an operator of private jets public through one of his own investment vehicles.</p> <p>A blank cheque company called <strong>Horizon Acquisition Corporation II</strong> backed by Boehly's holding company<strong> Eldridge Industries</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c362d6e-5c6e-41a2-9969-f7041e09a699\">announced a merger</a> with private jet operator <strong>Flexjet</strong> at a $3.1bn enterprise valuation, the FT's Claire Bushey and DD's James Fontanella-Khan report.</p> <p>The deal effectively gives Boehly the opportunity to keep a close eye on his investment empire, from attending a <strong>Los Angeles Dodgers</strong> baseball game to watching <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7e665bbd-034f-4c21-b4a8-eb5a91999763\"><strong>Chelsea Football Club</strong></a> contend for the Premier League title in London.</p> <p>He's part of the ownership group of both famed sports teams, and also counts the<strong> Waldorf Astoria </strong>in Beverly Hills, <strong>The</strong> <strong>Hollywood Reporter </strong>magazine for insiders in the movie industry and the music catalogues of <strong>The Killers</strong> and <strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong> as investments.</p> <p>Flexjet became a sensation during the reopening following Covid lockdowns as the ultra-rich, many of whom were made wealthier by a stock market boom, booked private travel at unheard of rates.</p> <p>Demand was so hot at one point in 2021 that Flexjet closed its jet card programme — a pre-paid balance of flight hours — to new customers. The company reported net income in fiscal 2021 of just under $53mn on $1.7bn in revenue.</p> <p>Boehly's Spac is betting the high times for jet-setting dealmakers continue, even as stock markets crater due to rising interest rates.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Moelis &amp; Co</strong> has hired <strong>Morgan Stanley </strong>veteran<strong> Rick Polhemus </strong>as a managing director, based in San Francisco.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> M&amp;A partner <strong>David Holdsworth </strong><a href=\"https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/kirkland-ellis-ma-partner-exits-for-private-equity-firm-tdr-capital-20221011\">has quit</a> the US firm's London office to join private equity firm <strong>TDR Capital</strong>, per Financial News.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Latham &amp; Watkins</strong> has hired<strong> Aaron Gardner </strong>as a partner in New York. He joins from <strong>Arnold &amp; Porter</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>Law firm <strong>Jones Day</strong> has hired <strong>Rubina Ali</strong>, most recently senior counsel at<strong> Goldman Sachs</strong>, as counsel in its financial markets practice.
