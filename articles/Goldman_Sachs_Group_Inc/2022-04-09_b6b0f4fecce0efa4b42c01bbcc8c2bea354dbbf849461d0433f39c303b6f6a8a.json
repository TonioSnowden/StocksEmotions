  "title": "Goldman Sachs' $50 million bonus to CEO and COO called ‘excessive'",
  "text": "<p>“We are concerned about special, one-off grants to the CEO and COO,” said the Glass Lewis note to shareholders that was&#xa0;reported by the Financial Times&#xa0;said. “Such awards have the potential to undermine the integrity of a company's regular incentive plans, the link between pay and performance or both.”</p><p>Goldman has contended that its compensation will “drive long-term shareholder value creation” and “ensure leadership continuity over the next five-plus years.” The multi-million dollar stock awards won't be paid out until October 2026.</p><p>Glass Lewis said when shareholders are asked on April 28 whether to approve the pay packages, they should say no. So-called say-on-pay votes at publicly traded companies are strictly advisory, but if a company's shareholders vote against a pay package, it can be seen as a black eye.</p><p>“We believe that long-term incentives should encourage executives to achieve steady and sustainable growth rather than what may amount to relatively brief spikes in performance,” Glass Lewis said.</p><p>Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p><p>At Goldman, Solomon's total pay includes an annual base salary of $2 million and a variable compensation of $33 million, 70% of which is in the form of goal-based stock compensation or restricted stock units.</p><p>Solomon's compensation is in line with his competitors. James Gorman, CEO at Morgan Stanley MS,&#xa0;also raked in the same amount&#xa0;— $35 million — for 2021. JPMorgan Chase JPM CEO Jamie Dimon's 2021 total compensation clocked in at $34.5 million.</p><p>Solomon's 2021 payday was double the $17.5 million he made in 2020 — Solomon was docked after Goldman admitted wrongdoing in the 1MDB scandal that plundered the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund.</p><p>Meanwhile,&#xa0;bank stocks have fallen sharply so far this year&#xa0;even after bumper results on the back of a banner year for mergers-and-acquisitions.</p><p>That's because they also reported sharply higher expenses — in large part because of the fat pay packages they're doling out in a tight labor market.</p><p>This article was first published on NYPost.com</p>",
