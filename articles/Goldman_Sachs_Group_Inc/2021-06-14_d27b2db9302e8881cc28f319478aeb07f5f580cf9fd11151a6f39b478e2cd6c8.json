  "text": "<p>Some of Singapore's largest offshore-listed companies have considered whether to hold “homecoming” share sales in the city-state after approaches from its stock market and investment bankers.</p> <p>The talks, which followed a recent wave of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf7a8890-16f3-4821-81a0-8d0c4ab3a7e7\">homecoming listings</a> by Chinese technology companies in Hong Kong, would provide a boost for the south-east Asian nation's bourse, the Singapore Exchange. </p> <p>Singaporean companies that have discussed the move include Sea, an internet company that listed in New York in 2017, ride-hailing and food delivery app Grab and Hong Kong-listed gaming group Razer, according to several people familiar with the talks.&#xa0;Grab is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a44185aa-51f4-443a-895f-16dd853e1d77\">separately listing</a> via a special purpose acquisition company, or Spac, in the US. </p> <p>The homecoming listings in Hong Kong were driven by political pressure from the US, but they have allowed the groups to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b8bc9c0-788d-4f64-a4e6-af169dd3a795\">raise large amounts</a> from investors closer to their China headquarters.</p> <p>SGX's equity trading business, meanwhile, has been hurt by a series of accounting scandals that have led to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d69846ae-6052-487f-a5c2-d35761f8d3d8\">delistings</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35057281-2c33-42f5-a211-c458731f97fd\">low trading volumes</a>. </p> <p>It has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/340124a2-a38e-11e9-974c-ad1c6ab5efd1\">struggled to attract tech names</a> despite partnerships with the Nasdaq and Tel Aviv exchanges and has looked for other <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38f37b45-3bf2-4db1-9003-83b5e0829535\">routes to grow</a>, including a proposal to become the first bourse in Asia to allow <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/18d51d14-4f2d-4a28-853d-b2eaf3b0eb00\">Spac listings</a>.</p> <p>A US investment banker in Singapore said: “Historically the idea you could do meaningful local listings was only possible for a very select group, but that has changed dramatically in the last couple of years. The homecoming exercise in Hong Kong has created a huge amount of extra liquidity for those companies.”</p> <p>SGX told the Financial Times it had seen “increasing interest in our secondary listing framework as companies see the value of being listed closer to home”.</p> <p>However, one senior investment banker said the SGX's small size meant secondary listings there “make little sense from a capital markets perspective but there may be political pressure”.</p> <p>The market capitalisation of Singapore's equity market totalled about $690bn at the end of April — equivalent to about one-tenth of Hong Kong's $6.9tn market, according to FT calculations based on figures provided by the exchanges.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8454485d-7054-41ae-9f7c-0e81d6e1b21b\">Sea</a>, whose market value of $145bn makes it larger than most US tech stocks, has been approached by SGX and bankers about a possible dual listing, according to a person familiar with the matter. </p> <p>The company has talked to its bankers at Goldman Sachs about whether to explore such a deal, according to a second person. Sea and Goldman declined to comment.&#xa0;</p> <p>SGX has approached a string of other high-profile foreign-listed companies, according to a senior investment banker in Singapore familiar with the matter.</p> <p>Grab, south-east Asia's answer to Uber, has looked into whether to carry out a secondary listing in Singapore after it completes its $40bn Spac deal to list on Nasdaq, according to two people close to the matter. </p> <p>The ride-hailing giant, whose backers include Singapore state investment fund Temasek, said: “We've explored opportunities in south-east Asia, but do not have plans for a secondary listing now.”</p> <p>Hong Kong-listed Razer, which sells video game electronics, is in talks with banks about listing on a second exchange, according to two people familiar with the matter. </p> <p>South-east Asia has benefited as international investors diversify away from China amid geopolitical tensions with the US, and following growth in its tech and consumer sectors.&#xa0;</p> <p>David Biller, head of investment banking for south-east Asia at Citi, said countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand were “now at the forefront of investable growth in the region away from China and India”.</p> <p>Martin Siah, head of south-east Asia global corporate and investment banking at Bank of America, said it had been a “breakout year” for investment banking activity in south-east Asia, particularly in Thailand and the Philippines.</p> <p>This year, investment bank fees from deals in countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, whose largest markets are Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and the Philippines, are at a near-record level of $175m, according to data from Dealogic.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong</em></p><p>Source: Tabby Kinder in Hong Kong and Stefania Palma in Singapore 2021 'Singapore offshore-listed companies consider ‘homecoming' flotations' FT.com 14 June.
