He was a great supporter of this newsletter and frequently offered up his wise counsel on a diverse range of issues. Paul also had a wicked sense of humour and will be sorely missed by many members of the DD team.</p> <p><strong>Happening today:</strong> It's not too late to sign up for our first Due Diligence: Dialogues event featuring Goldman Sachs veteran Gregg Lemkau. Register for free <a href=\"https://events.bizzabo.com/377854/home\">here</a> and join us virtually at 9:30am EST, 14:30 GMT. </p> <h2>Rubenstein receives an unwanted request from Leon Black</h2> <p>“The greatest material curse to the profession, despite all its advantages, is undoubtedly the telephone.”</p> <p>Those are the words of<strong> Allen Dulles</strong>, the American statesman who began his career spying on Nazis in Switzerland, and told his minions to unplug the wretched receiver during sensitive conversations — or better still, keep it in a box or cupboard.</p> <p>Such advice might resonate with New York PR man <strong>Steven Rubenstein</strong>, whose eponymous firm has worked “with everyone from Presidents to Popes”, according to its website.</p> <p>That's because Rubenstein and his phone have been dragged into a bitter legal dispute involving <strong>Leon Black</strong>, the billionaire investor who was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5da69898-fd50-4c45-87ca-f913b9da1519\">until recently</a> chief executive of <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>.</p> <p>Black is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c625b5d-734b-4934-8943-d02f9f2fb2e8\">being sued</a> by a Russian fashion model,<strong> Guzel Ganieva</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba1a0cef-f25c-42bd-ae12-ac4dfb6971d7\">who says</a> he sexually abused her during their relationship and then damaged her reputation by publicly accusing her of extortion after she posted her grievances on Twitter.</p> <p>The billionaire <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ba1a0cef-f25c-42bd-ae12-ac4dfb6971d7\">denies the allegations</a>, and his lawyers have called the entire lawsuit “a work of fiction”.</p> <p>What's more, they have filed a lawsuit against Ganieva and her lawyers at <strong>Wigdor</strong>, alleging that they are perpetrators of a wide-ranging extortion scheme “to try to get even more from Mr Black — or destroy him in the process”. Wigdor has rejected the allegations and complained of what they view as an abuse of the legal process. </p> <p>DD's Mark Vandevelde and Sujeet Indap have more on this extraordinary legal battle <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5146672c-73b6-43df-b25d-e0162ad3d6a2\">here</a>.</p> <p>Rubenstein is not mentioned in the lawsuit and said he discovered that he was being drawn into the fight in December, when <strong>Verizon</strong> told him they had received a subpoena from Black's lawyers demanding details of every call and text message sent to or from his iPhone over a 12-month period.</p> <p>“Any private citizen should be aghast that [a bystander to a lawsuit] could be made the subject of a subpoena calling for all their telephone records simply at the whim of a litigant,” Rubenstein's lawyers wrote in a motion to quash the order.</p> <p>A representative for Rubenstein told the FT: “We have had absolutely no relationship, or contact of any kind, formal or informal, direct or indirect, with the plaintiff in the underlying matter.”</p> <h2>Unilever/GSK: Fourth time's the charm?</h2> <p>After <a href=\"https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/media/press-releases/update-gsk-consumer-healthcare/\">three failed attempts</a> to buy UK drugmaker <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong>'s consumer healthcare business, <strong>Unilever </strong>refuses to back down.</p> <p>The British multinational still hopes to pursue a deal with GSK, sources <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77efdd90-7a56-46aa-ab39-b72ec68260b2\">told the FT</a>, despite the pharmaceutical group's dismissal of its latest £50bn offer as one that “fundamentally undervalued” the business it intended to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/887a20d2-4d72-4ce0-8722-4883a6420233\">spin off</a> later this year.</p> <p>Unilever insists that GSK's portfolio of toothpaste, vitamins and other products is a “strong strategic fit” as it shifts its focus away from sluggish areas like food (its portfolio includes<strong> Hellmann's</strong> mayonnaise and<strong> Ben &amp; Jerry's</strong> ice cream) and further into the health and beauty sectors.</p> <p>But many Unilever investors think it should move on. The company's share price tumbled to its lowest level in nearly five years on Monday.</p> <p>In addition to concerns over the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c9191e1-c175-4866-9bd5-126df8709dec\">heavy debts</a> Unilever would have to take on to make the deal happen, the FT's Helen Thomas <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77efdd90-7a56-46aa-ab39-b72ec68260b2\">explains</a> investors are fretting over management's decision-making capabilities in general.</p> <p>Unilever has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7aa44a9a-7fec-4850-8edb-63feee1b837b\">“lost the plot”</a> by attempting to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8feb8f98-c6d9-4288-9ce8-9e68be621a60\">flaunt its sustainability credentials</a> at the expense of running the business, star fund manager <strong>Terry Smith</strong>, whose <strong>Fundsmith </strong>is one of the company's largest shareholders, said last week before the GSK bid was announced.</p> <p>GSK shareholders have their own reasons to oppose a Unilever takeover, unimpressed by the company's management and emboldened by the bid that the business has the potential to attract other suitors.</p> <p>“The idea of letting the goons at Unilever run it is laughable,” said <strong>Richard Buxton </strong>at <strong>Jupiter Capital Management</strong>, a top-30 shareholder in GSK.</p> <p>The publicity has worked well for GSK, as the possibility of a bidding war boosted its shares on Monday.</p> <h2>Centrica/NSO: the thin veneer between private equity funds and their investors&#xa0;</h2> <p>A basic premise of a private equity fund is that institutions committing money to the pool do so without knowing what it is going to be spent on later. </p> <p>So <strong>Centrica</strong>, the parent company of Britain's biggest energy company <strong>British Gas</strong>, couldn't have known when it committed millions of euros of its employees' pension fund cash to private equity group <strong>Novalpina Capital</strong> that it would be used to buy the Israeli cyberweapon developer <strong>NSO Group</strong>. The company was blacklisted by the <strong>US Department of Commerce</strong> last year.</p> <p>Still, <strong>Amnesty International</strong> has criticised institutions that invested in Novalpina alongside Centrica for being “directly linked” to human rights abuse. </p> <p>Centrica has so far avoided such opprobrium, because unlike relatively transparent public pension funds such as the <strong>Oregon Public Employees Retirement System</strong> and the <strong>South Yorkshire Pensions Authority</strong>, it kept its involvement in the fraught situation out of the public eye — until DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Mehul Srivastava revealed it with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b427be6-1025-4295-a25c-16374da53b79\">this scoop</a>. </p> <p>The family office of Belgian billionaire <strong>Albert Frère</strong>, who died in 2018, was another previously-unknown investor in the fund. <strong>Compagnie Nationale à Portefeuille</strong> committed about €50m to it.</p> <p>Both may now come in for far closer scrutiny. <strong>Gauthier Parisis</strong>, chief legal officer of CNP, said it doesn't take part in the fund's investment decisions. So far, Centrica has stayed silent on the matter. </p> <p>The situation is messy and moving fast. Novalpina fell apart itself last year, its founding partners <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d88518dd-7c66-48b2-b3e5-c765ebe720ab\">stripped of control</a> of the fund in a highly unusual move.</p> <p>It's a reminder that pension funds and public bodies who blindly hand their cash to buyout groups are ultimately held accountable for what is done with their money — and of how the screen between them and the private equity dealmakers they entrust is paper-thin. </p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>António Horta-Osório</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/48d159bd-a3c0-4025-8c5b-d7dfbf59526a\">has resigned</a> as chair of <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71c4abb0-0c75-4b73-a622-98ed7833b702\">repeated breaches</a> of coronavirus quarantine rules, including attending the Wimbledon finals and the use of the bank's private jet for a personal holiday to the Maldives. </p><p>His departure comes nine months after he arrived in April, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2cac83f5-9631-45ae-8080-586a6bc90d55\">promising a clean-up</a> of the scandal-hit bank.<strong> Axel Lehmann</strong>, the former chief operating officer and head of the Swiss business at <strong>UBS </strong>who joined Credit Suisse's board in October, has been drafted in as the bank's new chair. </p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Bridgewater Associates </strong>has appointed two co-chief executives to replace<strong> David McCormick</strong>, who is expected to run for the US Senate. <strong>Nir Bar Dea</strong>, previously the hedge fund's deputy chief, will share the top job with <strong>Mark Bertolini</strong>, co-chair of Bridgewater's operating board of directors and a former healthcare executive.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Sports streaming service<strong> DAZN</strong> has named its co-chief executive <strong>Shay Segev</strong> as its sole chief executive and former <strong>Prime Video</strong> finance director <strong>Darren Waterman</strong> as its new finance chief. <strong>James Rushton</strong>, who had been serving as co-CEO, will step down from the role while remaining at the company.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Linklaters </strong>has promoted <strong>Greg Baker</strong> to the newly created role of global head of practice innovation, based in London.</p></li> </ul><p>Source:  2022 'The New York PR maven entangled in Leon Black's legal battle' FT.com 18 January.
