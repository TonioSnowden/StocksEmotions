  "title": "McKinsey Partner Charged With Securities Fraud Over Goldman Sachs Deal; Puneet Dikshit is accused of trading insider information related to the Wall Street bank's purchase of lender GreenSky",
  "text": "<p>\"This breach of duties to his firm and its investment bank client—and violation of the law—allegedly reaped the defendant nearly half a million dollars in illegal profits,\" said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams.</p><p>Mr. Dikshit was arrested Wednesday morning and is expected to appear in federal court in Manhattan in the afternoon, the authorities said. A lawyer for Mr. Dikshit didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Goldman and McKinsey aren't named in a criminal complaint unsealed Wednesday.</p><p>A McKinsey spokesman said Mr. Dikshit had been fired for a gross violation of the firm's policies and code of conduct. \"We have zero tolerance for the appalling behavior described in the complaint and we will continue cooperating with the authorities,\" the spokesman said.</p><p>Representatives for Goldman and GreenSky didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>In September, Goldman said it would acquire GreenSky, which arranges loans for one-time purchases like construction projects or cosmetic surgery, for $2.2 billion. Goldman Chief Executive David Solomon said at the time that the acquisition would help Goldman \"build a real banking platform of the future.\"</p><p>From November 2019 until July 2020, and again from April through September of this year, Goldman hired McKinsey to consult on its possible acquisition of GreenSky, according to the complaint. As one of the partners leading the project, Mr. Dikshit had access to nonpublic information about the deal, prosecutors said.</p><p>In the days before a Sept. 15 public announcement about the acquisition, Mr. Dikshit bought bullish options that would pay off if the stock price of GreenSky rose above a certain threshold, which it did after the deal was announced, according to the complaint. Mr. Dikshit made about $450,000 in profits, prosecutors said.</p><p>Dave Michaels contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com</p><p>McKinsey Partner Charged With Securities Fraud Over Goldman Sachs Deal</p>",
