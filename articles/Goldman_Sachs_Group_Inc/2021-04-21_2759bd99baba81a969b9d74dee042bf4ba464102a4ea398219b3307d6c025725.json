  "text": "<p>Jörg Kukies, Germany's deputy finance minister, denied seeking to protect the disgraced payment company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/wirecard\">Wirecard</a> as a national champion, insisting that it had never received “privileged treatment” at the hands of his ministry.</p> <p>Kukies' denial was part of a long opening statement at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6e0c6b5f-3461-463d-b49b-f572dbc39c26\">parliamentary inquiry</a> into one of the biggest frauds in Germany's postwar history. “I personally never acted or intervened in favour of Wirecard,” he said. </p> <p>He said that Germany had “learnt the lesson” from the Wirecard scandal, initiating <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f293ad1-9a80-4f3f-9043-9a8d512e8060\">sweeping reform</a> of BaFin, the German financial regulator, that would give it “more bite” and poaching the respected head of Swiss regulator Finma, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3cb7fd93-4185-478d-b3b7-e4ce1532515d\">Mark Branson</a>, as its new boss.</p> <p>MPs are investigating why the German authorities failed to prevent the Wirecard debacle and ignored a plethora of warning signs of suspicious activity at the payment provider. Their hearings reach a climax this week with the questioning of Olaf Scholz, the finance minister, and Angela Merkel, Germany's veteran chancellor.</p> <p>Wirecard announced last June that €1.9bn was missing from its accounts and soon afterwards collapsed into insolvency. Prosecutors in Munich accuse its former chief executive, Markus Braun, of having run a criminal racket that conducted “fraud in the billions”. Braun, who has been in police custody since last summer, denies all wrongdoing. </p> <p>Some MPs on the inquiry believe the authorities handled Wirecard with kid gloves and failed to take critical reports of irregularities at the company seriously. </p> <p>They have been particularly critical of BaFin's ban on the short selling of Wirecard's shares in February 2019 — which sent a message that the company was the innocent victim of speculators — and the criminal complaint it filed against the Financial Times reporters who uncovered suspicious activity at the company. The finance ministry, which oversees BaFin, has also had to answer pointed questions over its role in the scandal.</p> <p>Kukies, a former Goldman Sachs banker, said he felt “very sorry for the thousands of investors who lost a lot of money — including in many cases their entire old-age provision — through Wirecard's machinations”. </p> <p>But he insisted that “at no point did Wirecard enjoy privileged treatment” at the hands of the German finance ministry and there was “no special interest in defending a so-called national champion Wirecard”.</p> <p>In his statement, Kukies defended himself against accusations that he could have pressed BaFin to take a more proactive role in the Wirecard affair, insisting that the finance ministry was legally barred from influencing the regulator. </p> <p>Kukies said BaFin had informed him of its plans to impose a short selling ban but he was not involved in the decision and did not try to stop it. He said his understanding of BaFin's operational independence was that he must “refrain from intervening” in the agency, and any such interference would in any case have violated EU regulations.</p> <p>He also referred to comments by Felix Hufeld, BaFin's former president, who told the parliamentary inquiry last month that the regulator had not made it clear enough that its short selling ban did not mean it was “taking sides” and showing favouritism to Wirecard. “I share this view,” Kukies said.</p> <p>Kukies has also come under scrutiny from MPs over a meeting he held with Braun on November 5 2019, Braun's birthday, at Wirecard's headquarters in Aschheim, Bavaria, when information on irregularities at the company had long been in the public domain.</p> <p>He insisted that the conversation with Braun was “unspectacular”, covering KPMG's special audit of Wirecard, which was then going on, as well as issues such as cryptocurrencies, cloud computing, and the financing of start-ups in Germany. </p> <p>He said it was part of his job to meet chief executives of leading German companies, and Braun had been on the list of possible contacts compiled by his office since the summer of 2018, when Wirecard first entered the blue-chip Dax index. Of the meeting on November 5, he said: “I didn't know it was his birthday.”</p><p>Source: Guy Chazan in Berlin 2021 'Wirecard given no ‘privileged treatment', says German finance deputy  ' FT.com 21 April.
