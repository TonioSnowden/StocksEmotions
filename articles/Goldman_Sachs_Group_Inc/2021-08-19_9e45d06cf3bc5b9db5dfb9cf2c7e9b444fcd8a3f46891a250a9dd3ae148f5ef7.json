  "title": "Chinese Bad-Debt Manager Huarong to Be Bailed Out by State-Owned Companies; Manager of distressed assets says it expects to post a net loss equivalent to about $16 billion for 2020",
  "text": "<p>Late Wednesday, the company said it expects to post a net loss equivalent to about $16 billion for 2020. Earlier this year, the firm's delay in releasing its results spooked international investors and caused its bond prices to tumble.</p><p>The Beijing-based company blamed its past overexpansion and other problems on former Chairman Lai Xiaomin, who was executed after a court found him guilty of bribery and embezzlement. It also said the coronavirus pandemic and its negative impact on markets caused a swift deterioration in some of its assets.</p><p>Huarong said five state-owned financial companies, including Citic Group, fellow bad-debt manager China Cinda Asset Management and an investment unit of China Life Insurance Co., have signed an agreement to purchase newly issued shares, though it didn't detail how much capital they planned to contribute.</p><p>Huarong added that if the investment takes place, \"it will effectively replenish the company's capital, further consolidate the company's foundation for sustainable operations and ensure that the company meets regulatory requirements.\"</p><p>The company also said in a post on a Chinese social-media account that it isn't planning a debt restructuring, suggesting that bondholders won't be forced to take losses. It said it had paid off the equivalent of $9.8 billion in bonds since April 1, adding that it expects to fulfill its coming debt obligations.</p><p>Prices of some of Huarong's U.S. dollar bonds jumped Thursday after the company issued its statements. A bond that comes due in April next year pays a coupon of 3.375% was showing a bid price of 99 cents on the dollar, up 7 cents from a day earlier, according to Tradeweb.</p><p>Other corporate bonds of state-owned Chinese companies also chalked up gains, according to James Wong, portfolio manager of GaoTeng Global Asset Management in Hong Kong. He said investors were encouraged that the Chinese government would provide support to systemically important companies.</p><p>\"The 'too big to fail' argument finally wins in the case of Huarong's restructuring,\" said Li-Gang Liu, chief China economist at Citi Research.</p><p>Defaults at Chinese companies, including state-backed firms, have become more common in recent years, as China has tried to dispel the idea that it will always make creditors whole.</p><p>Huarong, however, plays an important role in the country's financial system. Created in 1999, it is among an elite group of state-appointed asset managers that help Chinese commercial banks dispose of defaulted loans, which enables the lenders to make new ones.</p><p>The company has low investment-grade ratings from global credit-rating firms and about $22 billion in offshore debt. Some of its long-term dollar bonds had earlier tumbled to as low as 60 cents on the dollar, levels commonly associated with distressed junk bonds.</p><p>\"The transaction preserves the status quo on what it means to be a Chinese state-owned enterprise with implicit state support, and that's a big deal,\" said Paul Lukaszewski, head of corporate debt for the Asia-Pacific region at Aberdeen Standard Investment. \"Huarong's developments suggest default risk is off the table,\" he added.</p><p>The company's large 2020 loss stands in contrast with its year-earlier profit of about $220 million. Its Hong Kong-listed shares have been suspended from trading since April 1, when Huarong had a market capitalization of $5 billion.</p><p>Under its former chairman, Huarong expanded into businesses including securities trading and commercial lending, straying from its core mission of managing distressed assets. The company said it has been downsizing and disposing of assets caused by the late Mr. Lai's \"aggressive operation and disorderly expansion during his tenure.\" Earlier this month, the company said it would sell its majority stake in a consumer finance unit and restructure a trust business.</p><p>Units of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc. and other global financial companies previously invested in Huarong. Existing investors' stakes will likely be diluted when the state-owned financial institutions buy new shares in the company.</p><p>The Chinese asset manager said it plans to replenish its capital, improve its liquidity management, reduce risks and return to its core business of buying bad loans and helping companies restructure their debts. It pledged that the \"New Huarong\" would be a more stable company that will work under the oversight of regulators and the state to \"serve the needs of national development strategies.\"</p><p>P.R.
