  "title": "Business News: Goldman's Petershill Plans Listing",
  "text": "<p>Founded in 2007, Petershill plans to raise $750 million by selling new shares and will separately sell existing shares. Some of the firms Petershill invested in include Francisco Partners, Caxton Associates LP and Pelham Capital Ltd. Following the offering of new and existing shares, at least a quarter of the new vehicle's shares will be listed.</p><p>The listing comes during a buoyant time for private equity. The industry has attracted hundreds of billions of dollars from investors over the course of the pandemic. The share prices of large private-equity firms such as Blackstone Group Inc. have skyrocketed.</p><p>A public listing would give Petershill a new source of capital to help fund additional investments. Petershill has targeted firms that manage technology investments since 2017 and recently launched a focus on healthcare and environmental, social and governance matters.</p><p>The listing is part of Goldman's efforts to capitalize on its asset-management businesses.</p>",
