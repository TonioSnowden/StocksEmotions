  "title": "Letters to the Editor:  Medication's Role in Treating Mental Illness",
  "text": "<p>   Erica Komisar rightly draws attention to overmedication of patients who present with symptoms of anxiety and depression (\"For Mental Illness, Make Pills a Last Resort,\" op-ed, April 5). But she questions the validity of these conditions as legitimate brain disorders, overlooking decades of research. </p><p>   She concludes that medication should be used \"for serious clinical conditions, or only after everything else has been tried and failed.\" Following this recommendation would place many patients at risk for worsening conditions, unnecessary suffering and, in some cases, increased mortality. </p><p>   In more than 40 years of practice, I saw many patients who were initially too depressed or anxious to benefit from psychotherapy alone. Following initial prescriptions of antianxiety or antidepressant medications or both, they gained the energy, motivation and focus to benefit a few weeks later from various psychotherapy approaches. </p><p>   Overprescription of psychotropic medications correlates with several current trends: Higher insurance reimbursement for medication sessions than for psychotherapy; decreased psychotherapy training in psychiatry residency programs; and suboptimal training for internists and family practitioners in psychopharmacology. </p><p>   John S. Graves, M.D. </p><p>   Denver </p><p>   --- </p><p>   When my second child was born, I experienced postpartum depression that left me paralyzed by anxiety. Thank goodness my doctor didn't wait until \"everything else had been tried\" to prescribe medication. </p><p>   One could say insulin \"masks\" diabetes, and the patient should live more healthfully, but I can't imagine an article suggesting insulin be used only as a last resort. Doing so would endanger the patient, as would delaying psychiatric medication when needed. </p><p>   Laurie Goldman </p><p>   Birmingham, Mich. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. Komisar's thesis that doctors are overprescribing medications for mental illness is accurate. These medications often are effective short term but not for a period of months or years. When the medication becomes less effective, the patients demand another medication -- often a drug they have seen advertised. But the basic problem is that much of mental illness is caused by unhappiness with one's personal situation. No amount of medication or psychotherapy can cure this. </p><p>   Joseph Bentivegna, M.D. </p><p>   Fairfield, Conn. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Ms. Komisar, a psychoanalyst, asserts that cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) \"focuses on symptom relief rather than the underlying causes\" and that \"insurance companies should be pressured into covering treatments that work.\" She seems blissfully unaware of the mountain of evidence from more than 600 large-scale randomized controlled trials that has established that CBT is a highly effective treatment for mental disorders. </p><p>   Many studies over the years have also shown that the similar psychoanalytic claim that \"symptom substitution\" will occur has no substance (e.g., someone treated with CBT for a fear of cats will not subsequently develop another disorder, such as a fear of heights). The extensive evidence for the efficacy of CBT stands in contrast to the conspicuous lack of any equivalent scientific evidence for psychoanalytic therapy. </p><p>   Ms. Komisar would apparently prefer to have the millions of people who demonstrably benefit from modern evidence-based treatments to instead seek out expensive, thrice-weekly lifelong treatments of no proven value. </p><p>   Em. Prof. John Riskind </p><p>   George Mason University </p><p>   Fairfax, Va. </p><p>   Dr. Riskind is editor of the International Journal of Cognitive Therapy. </p><p></p>",
