  "text": "<p>Amazon.com's new chief executive didn't appear on the company's second-quarter call Thursday afternoon. That continues a long tradition: Founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos hasn't participated in those calls since 2009, according to a transcript search on S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>For Mr. Bezos, the habit seemed part of an intense time-management strategy. He admitted in an interview at Business Insider's Ignite conference in 2014 that he spends just six hours a year on investor relations, claiming that he meets only with long-term investors \"with low portfolio turns.\"</p><p>Whether Mr. Jassy will be afforded the same luxury remains to be seen. He formally took over the CEO job on July 5 -- after the second quarter ended. But the first report under his watch still turned out to be a doozy, with Amazon's revenue and operating income missing Wall Street's targets and sending the stock tumbling.</p><p>Still, while running the company's cloud business, he did show at least one sign of being more out-front with investors by presenting at a Goldman Sachs conference early last year.</p><p>Mr. Jassy's equally busy peers at Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Facebook all participate in their quarterly calls. Amazon investors gave Mr. Bezos a pass, as the stock has returned more than 4,000% since he stopped appearing on the company's calls. Mr. Jassy might not get cut quite as much slack.</p>",
