  "title": "Rising Inflation Expectations, Hawkish Fed Prompted Larger Bank of Mexico Rate Increase, Minutes Show; The central bank raised its policy interest rate by a half percentage point to 5.5% at Dec. 16 meeting",
  "text": "<p>Deputy Governor Gerardo Esquivel, who had voted against the previous increases, called for a quarter-point rise in December. He cited expectations of a tighter monetary stance by the Fed and its impact on global financial conditions, as well as greater uncertainty and volatility in local markets, in explaining his vote.</p><p>But Mr. Esquivel said the rate of monetary tightening should be moderate. \"Getting too far ahead of the Fed's normalization process puts the economy at risk of falling into a trap of low growth and financial instability,\" he said.</p><p>The Fed decided in December to reduce its bond purchases at a faster pace, and pointed to the likelihood of three interest-rate increases in 2022, possibly starting as early as March. Fed minutes on Wednesday confirmed a more restrictive leaning among officials amid concerns that inflation could remain higher for longer.</p><p>The Bank of Mexico dropped the word \"transitory\" to describe inflation from its December statement after inflation reached a 20-year high around 7.4%. Some bank board members considered that arguments about the temporary nature of inflationary pressures \"no longer seem appropriate to explain the current situation,\" according to Thursday's minutes.</p><p>\"The majority agreed that at a global level central banks are expected to adopt progressively less accommodative policy stances,\" the bank said.</p><p>Several board members said the larger interest-rate increase was needed since the previous moves hadn't succeeded in containing inflation or inflation expectations.</p><p>Analysts are split over whether the Bank of Mexico will continue with half-point increases this year, or return to a more gradual pace under new central bank governor Victoria Rodríguez, the former deputy finance minister who replaced Alejandro Díaz de León on Jan. 1.</p><p>Fifteen of 28 banks polled this week by Citibanamex predicted a quarter-point increase at the Feb. 10 meeting, and 12 expect a half-point rise.</p><p>\"In our assessment, the message of the minutes will be somewhat diluted by the fact the Dec. 16 meeting was Governor Diaz de Leon's last, and little is known about policy preferences and convictions of the new central bank governor,\" Goldman Sachs' chief Latin America economist Alberto Ramos said.</p><p>Still, the central bank is likely to continue raising rates at least in the near term, Mr. Ramos said: \"Usually even dovish central bank presidents act in a hawkish way in initial stages in order to build their credentials…and the last inflation number after the meeting was pretty nasty, particularly on core.\"</p><p>President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said last week that his administration will continue to respect the central bank's autonomy and inflation-fighting mandate, but hinted he would also like the bank to help spur economic growth.</p><p>\"Another thing we would like, but this is just an opinion, is that it should also fuel growth,\" he said.</p><p>Economic output shrank by 8.2% in 2020, and is expected to have expanded by about 5.5% last year after a strong rebound lost steam in the third quarter.</p><p>Write to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.com</p>",
