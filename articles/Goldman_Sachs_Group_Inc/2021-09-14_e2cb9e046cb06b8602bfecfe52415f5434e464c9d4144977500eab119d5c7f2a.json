  "title": "Monday's Markets:  S&P Edges Higher, Nasdaq Declines  ----  By Anna Hirtenstein and Michael Wursthorn",
  "text": "<p>   The S&amp;P 500 eked out a modest gain, shaking off earlier losses, thanks to rallying shares of energy companies. </p><p>   The stock rally has paused lately, with both the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average logging their steepest one-week declines since June on Friday. </p><p>   Money managers are hoping markets will get a fresh boost in the coming days, which will bring about new data on inflation, retail sales and consumer confidence. </p><p>   Investors say they are also closely watching a proposed $3.5 trillion spending plan from Washington that could potentially send more funds toward healthcare, education and climate legislation. </p><p>   \"I do believe that the bulls have a little more ammunition than the bears: Fiscal support still remains on tap, activity indicators are strong,\" said Gregory Perdon, chief investment officer of Arbuthnot Latham. \"Risk is still on.\" </p><p>   The S&amp;P 500 advanced 10.15 points, or 0.2%, to 4468.73. The Nasdaq Composite fell 9.91 points, or 0.1%, to 15105.58, paring declines toward the end of the trading day. </p><p>   The Dow industrials posted the strongest performance of the three indexes, rising 261.91 points, or 0.8%, to 34869.63. </p><p>   Energy shares were among the strongest performers in the S&amp;P 500 , rising alongside the price of oil after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it expected global demand to exceed pre-pandemic levels next year. </p><p>    Marathon Oil, APA and Occidental Petroleum rose at least 6.5% apiece. U.S. crude for October delivery gained 73 cents, or 1%, to $70.45 a barrel. </p><p>   Meanwhile, shares of Texas mining company and explorer Uranium Energy jumped 9 cents, or 2.8%, to $3.30 as individual investors sought out bets that would benefit from a recent rise in uranium prices. </p><p>    Airbnb slipped $4.88, or 3%, to $160.32 after Goldman Sachs Group analysts recommended investors sell the stock. </p><p>   Government bond prices ticked higher Monday, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edging down to 1.323% from 1.340% on Friday. Yields fall as bond prices rise. </p><p>   The current level of yields is signaling that bond investors see higher inflation levels as transitory, according to Georgina Taylor, a multiasset fund manager at Invesco. On Tuesday, traders will get a look at the latest readings on consumer prices. </p><p>   \"There is not enough inflationary pressure to really feel a reassessment of nominal growth over the long term,\" she said. </p><p>   Bitcoin rose $120.94, or 0.3%, to $45,144.18. Among other cryptocurrencies, etherium fell $21.32, or 0.6%, to $3,295.57. </p><p>   Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 ticked up 0.3%, snapping a four-session streak of losses. Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei 225 was up 0.4% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 0.1%. U.S stock futures were up 0.1%. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Akane Otani contributed to this article </p><p></p>",
