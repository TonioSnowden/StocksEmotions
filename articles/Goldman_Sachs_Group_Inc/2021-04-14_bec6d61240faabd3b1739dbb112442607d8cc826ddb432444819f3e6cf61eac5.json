  "title": "Heard on the Street:  China's Economy Still Relies on Housing, Exports  ----  By Nathaniel Taplin",
  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The world's second-largest economy kept chugging along in early 2021 with the help of some familiar drivers: housing and exports. A fall in the latter last month will probably prove temporary. But increasing regulatory ire could weigh on China's housing market -- and industrial metal prices -- in the second half. Aside from housing, durable signs of strong domestic demand remain relatively scarce. </p><p>\n  Exports grew an impressive 30.6% in March from a year earlier, data released Tuesday showed. But the year-over-year data is misleading. Goldman Sachs estimates exports contracted a seasonally adjusted 6.6% month-on-month in March compared with an 8.5% rise for January and February combined. </p><p>\n  The blip in exports was expected: The nation's February purchasing managers index showed new export orders falling for the first time since August. The factors behind that were probably temporary, however, including seasonal weakness related to the Lunar New Year and weakening import demand from the U.S. as American industrial output finally showed signs of catching up with domestic demand in early 2021. </p><p>\n  With the U.S. now unleashing another big fiscal stimulus, goods demand in America seems likely to outpace supply for some time. Chinese exports will probably rebound. </p><p>\n  Chinese domestic demand, meanwhile, remains heavily tilted toward housing and construction, to the chagrin of policy makers who have been trying to tighten the screws on real-estate developers and redirect credit into more productive uses. Import volume rose month on month, but most growth was driven by industrial commodities, notes Capital Economics, suggesting a pickup in heavy industry and construction. And house price growth is accelerating: Prices across 70 cities rose 0.4% on average month-over-month in February, the fastest pace since last August. </p><p>\n  Regulators are already sending further signals of displeasure: In early April, China's housing ministry corralled the leaders of five large cities to chastise them for mismanaging their local property markets, according to Gavekal Dragonomics. The consulting firm notes that the recent, suspiciously fast rise in so-called household operations loans -- intended for use by individual business proprietors -- probably means that some of that cash is being redirected into property. </p><p>\n  If regulators get serious, that could finally start to curb the housing boom in the second half. Meanwhile, the structure of China's recovery still looks stubbornly familiar -- rhetoric on industrial self-reliance and rebalancing under the mantra of \"domestic circulation\" notwithstanding. </p><p></p>",
