  "text": "<p>A former Goldman Sachs analyst and his lawyer brother will face a jury trial on insider dealing and fraud charges in April next year.</p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority accuses the brothers — Mohammed Zina, 32, who was an analyst for the investment bank's conflict resolution group in London; and Suhail, 33, who was a solicitor at law firm Clifford Chance — of making £142,000 in profit from trading six stocks using insider information, including Arm Holdings and Punch Taverns, between July 2016 and December 2017.</p> <p>The watchdog also alleges that the brothers defrauded Tesco Bank out of £95,000 through three loans purportedly for home improvements. The FCA maintains that the loans went to fund the pair's alleged insider trading.</p> <p>Judge Deborah Taylor set an April 2022 trial date at London's Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday.&#xa0;</p> <p>The brothers are set to enter a plea to the charges in June. Mohammed Zina has previously indicated that he will plead not guilty. The defendants did not have to appear in person in court on Tuesday.</p> <p>Fraud carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, while insider trading carries a maximum seven-year penalty.</p> <p>Both the brothers left their respective roles in 2018. Goldman Sachs previously said in a statement that it was not subject to an FCA investigation over the alleged wrongdoing.</p><p>Source: Caroline Binham 2021 'Former Goldman Sachs analyst and brother face trial over insider dealing' FT.com 16 March.
