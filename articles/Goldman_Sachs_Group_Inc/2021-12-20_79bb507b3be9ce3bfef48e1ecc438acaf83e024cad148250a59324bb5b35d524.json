Joe Manchin, D-W. Va., said on Sunday that he couldn't support the package. A 50-50 split between Democrats and Republicans, with all Republicans opposed to the plan, makes Manchin's vote crucial.</p><p>Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, citing Manchin's opposition to the package, cut their U.S. growth forecast. Specifically, they said the expiration of the child tax credit and the lack of the other new spending that had been expected were behind the reduction in their outlook. Growth was cut to an annualized 2% from 3% for the first quarter of 2022, to 3% from 3.5% for the second, and to 2.75% from 3% in the third quarter.In the only major data release for Monday, the U.S. leading economic index rose 1.1% in November.

Needless to say, as a meaningful contribution to the market's assumption of solid real growth in the year ahead, this represents a setback to be sure,” said Ian Lyngen and Ben Jeffery, rates strategists at BMO Capital Markets, in a note.</p><p>“Let us not forget the building COVID case count and mounting concerns that additional restrictions to combat the omicron variant will further undermine economic performance in the coming months,” they wrote. “While it's tempting to characterize these concerns as the usual suspects in the current environment, the reality is that the influence of pandemic and stimulus jitters becomes more relevant into year-end as liquidity wanes and conviction is scarce.”</p>",
