  "text": "<p>Credit Suisse said it would exit most of its prime brokerage business serving hedge funds with financing and trades. But its investment bank will otherwise remain largely intact, the bank said. That unit will also be more unified by combining its Swiss and Asian investment banking units with the global business.</p><p>Restructuring costs for the new three-year plan will be around $440 million.</p><p>Chairman António Horta-Osório promised the strategy reboot in April after joining in the wake of twin shocks. Credit Suisse lost $5.5 billion exiting stock positions of family office Archegos Capital Management in March, and separately had to freeze $10 billion in investment funds at its asset management arm when a financing partner, Greensill Capital, went bankrupt the same month. The bank said Thursday the asset management division will shrink assets by around 40% in the next year or so by exiting some investments and partnerships.</p><p>Credit Suisse reported a 21% fall in third-quarter net profit Thursday, to 434 million Swiss francs (equivalent to $476 million) from 546 million Swiss francs in third-quarter 2020. The bank said it expects to make a loss in the fourth quarter from fresh impairments at the investment bank.</p><p>Credit Suisse said changes to its management team will be announced closer to the plan being rolled out in January. Mr. Horta-Osório in recent months recruited new heads of risk, compliance, technology and human resources, and is expected to make further changes. He previously said the updated strategy would be carried out by Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein. Before the twin disasters this year, Mr. Gottstein vowed to stamp out risky practices and draw a line under past misdeeds.</p><p>In a string of costly scandals, Credit Suisse overlooked or ignored risks in its businesses, regulators have found. In October, the bank agreed to pay $475 million to U.S. and U.K. authorities and admitted to defrauding investors in loans it made in Mozambique last decade.</p><p>The same day, Switzerland's financial regulator said Credit Suisse broke supervisory law with seven spying operations on executives and others between 2016 and 2019 that were concealed from bank systems or went through informal channels.</p><p>The restructuring could help Credit Suisse avoid being subsumed by a stronger rival. Credit Suisse's private bank—particularly in Asia where it serves a growing cohort of Chinese entrepreneurs and their families—is seen as a jewel by rivals such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. Crosstown rival UBS Group AG in Zurich also has expressed interest in a merger.</p><p>Write to Margot Patrick at margot.patrick@wsj.com</p><p>Credit Suisse Revamps Business in Post-Archegos Overhaul</p>",
