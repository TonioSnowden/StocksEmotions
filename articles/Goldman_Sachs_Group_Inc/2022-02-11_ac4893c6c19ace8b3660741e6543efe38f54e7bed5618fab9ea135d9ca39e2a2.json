  "title": "Inflation has knocked back the market. Here are the key S&P 500 and tech stock levels one strategist fears.",
  "text": "<p>Summing up Thursday's “2 legs down” equity action, Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief economic adviser for Allianz, said inflation was, of course, the first arrow, but then stocks rebounded on “still strong behavioral conditions and confidence in earnings.”</p><p>“The second was driven by worries about a higher probability of a Fed policy mistake — that of first calling inflation wrong for so long, then not moving on policies, and now risking a ‘slamming of the policy brakes,'” he tweeted. Note Wall Street is busy revising its playbooks for hikes this year, with Goldman Sachs out in front with a call for seven increases.</p><p>Read: Inflation's on fire, and the Fed's poised to act. Here's how markets and the economy have reacted to the first hike in a cycle.</p><p>Our call of the day is from Mark Newton, Fundstrat's head of technical strategy, who says the equity pullback Thursday doesn't cancel the rally, but was a clear warning sign.</p><p>“Near-term, this dip should be bought until/unless SPX 4451 is broken, which would cause some downward volatility into late February, before a March rally. At present, insufficient damage has been done to warrant concern technically, but the risk levels are easily identifiable for this trend,” Newton told clients in a note, as he provided this chart:</p><p>As for technology stocks, they still haven't suffered enough to “expect a meaningful period of lagging,” he said, but advised keeping watch on the $157.44 level for the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF XLK and $287.90 for the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Technology RYT. A break below those levels would be bearish, otherwise it's just minor consolidation, he said.</p><p>Newton offered up one sector that he thinks “deserves a second look” — cannabis — following a rally back to multiweek highs after Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed a bill to legalize marijuana at a Federal level and make that a “priority.”</p><p>The analyst suggested ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF MJ in December as an intermediate-term bullish idea, and said recent price action makes it more attractive now.</p><p>“Specifically, the act of having climbed over early February peaks is bullish technically, and MJ has broken minor three-month downtrends that have been in place since November 2021. Furthermore, weekly MACD (as a gauge of intermediate-term momentum) is crossing back to positive this week, exceeding the signal line,” said Newton.</p><p>While the sector will need further strength to get over the long-term downturn in place since its February 2021 peak, “it looks appealing to buy and own MJ technically given this progress as a 2022 rebound candidate, expecting some mean reversion higher after such a lengthy decline,” Newton said.</p><p>He's looking at an initial target for the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF of $15.78, a November 2021 peak, adding that a drop back under $9 would postpone that rally. Other stocks of interest include Canopy Growth CGC, Tilray TLRY CA:TLRY, Curaleaf Holdings CURLF and GrowGeneration GRWG, said Newton.</p><p>Read:Cannabis sales set to rise ahead of Super Bowl Sunday</p><p>The buzz</p><p>Zillow Z is surging, after the online real estate group reported record revenue from selling underwater homes, with a better-than-expected forecast.</p><p>Also up is Expedia EXPE, after the travel group missed revenue forecasts, but delivered a rosy outlook.
