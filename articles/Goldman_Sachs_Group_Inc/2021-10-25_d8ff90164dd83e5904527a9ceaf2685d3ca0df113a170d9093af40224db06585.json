  "title": "After a rush of SPAC deals, the competition for buyout targets is getting fierce: ‘It's almost like a beauty pageant'",
  "text": "<p>Now the backlog of SPACs trying to buy a company has grown, and that has changed the dynamic between the sponsors and limited number of viable, privately held target companies they could acquire.</p><p>It's easier nowadays to debut a SPAC than it is to do an M&amp;A deal, for a variety of reasons. And the clock is ticking.</p><p>SPACs, also known as blank-check companies, raise money in an initial public offering and then seek to buy a business or businesses. Typically, they have two years to ink a deal, or else they have to return money to shareholders.</p><p>As of Oct. 13, 529 already-public SPACs have not closed an M&amp;A deal, even as more SPACs debut their shares, according to data service provider PrivateRaise. As of the same date, the rollicking new-issues market of 2021 has successfully launched 456 SPAC IPOs for combined proceeds of $116.6 billion. Those figures already outpace the full year of 2020, which saw 248 SPAC IPOs with combined proceeds of $75.5 billion.Yet as of Oct. 13, only 222 SPAC business combinations have taken place in 2021, up from 58 in the year-ago period, according to PrivateRaise. Adding to the logjam are roughly 308 SPACs in registration that have yet to begin trading.</p><p>“Two years ago if you'd been a SPAC and you came knocking, your target company would not have heard from another SPAC,” said Bill Meagher, senior reporter for The Deal. “Now, if you're targeting a company, you have to assume they're in touch with other SPACs. It's not unusual to have a half dozen SPACs involved with a target company. It is almost like a beauty pageant in some ways.”</p><p>SPACs are not only competing with other SPACs, they're also squaring off against private-equity firms shopping for portfolio companies. That makes it even harder for SPACs to put their money to work, said Joe Mantone, news desk manager for U.S. financial institutions at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>“There's a backlog of SPAC acquisitions and there's a lot of money chasing deals,” Mantone said. “It'll be interesting in how it plays out.”</p><p>SPACs regain their footing</p><p>Recapping 2021's historic SPAC IPO action, the market rose to a steady pace in the third quarter, after a big slowdown in the previous quarter and a huge rush of SPAC deals earlier this year.</p><p>Twenty-six SPAC IPOs raised $5.4 billion in September, preceded by 26 SPAC deals in August with combined proceeds of $4.73 billion and 23 deals in July that raised $4.89 billion, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>By contrast, in April, only nine deals raised $2.4 billion as the SPAC market cooled off considerably from March, when a whopping 99 deals raised $34 billion.</p><p>S&amp;P's Mantone said SPAC activity was chilled in the second quarter by comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p><p>Opinion:SPACs aren't dead, but they don't look too healthy</p><p>The SEC sparked concerns over increased regulatory scrutiny with a decree that warrants in SPACs owned by early investors should be declared as liabilities, not an asset on a company's balance sheet. The action caused public SPACS to restate their books and impacted the IPO pipeline.</p><p>The SEC issued a warning on SPACs issued by celebrities and cautioned investors to not buy shares based solely on a SPAC executive's public profile.</p><p>Opinion:&#xa0;He's a Trump supporter, but as an investor he's wary of the Trump SPAC</p><p>Key Words:Anthony Scaramucci is rooting for DWAC because he thinks it will keep Donald Trump from running in 2024</p><p>MemeMoney:&#xa0;For one day, SPACs don't feel whack, thanks to WeWork and Trump's DWAC</p><p>The SEC also zeroed in on overly optimistic forecasts by SPAC merger companies, in the wake of allegations about inaccurate business projections by Lordstown Motors RIDE and Nikola Corp. NKLA.</p><p>But once the SPAC market digested these changes over the summer, SPACs have resumed a healthy pace amid mostly bullish conditions in the overall equities market.</p><p>“While it's much lower than it was in the first quarter, it's higher now than it's been historically,” Mantone said.</p><p>When a SPAC buys a target company, it typically lines up institutional investors to purchase privately-issued stock in the combined company. These private investments in public equity, or PIPE deals, have had changing dynamics as well.</p><p>Nowadays, PIPE investors are able to be a bit more demanding with terms because the large number of deals out there have given them leverage.</p><p>“PIPE investors are getting a better deal because there's a little more perceived risk involved,” said The Deal's Meagher. “Also, you have to be realistic about the overall market. There are a lot of SPACs looking for deals right now.”</p><p>If a SPAC purchaser manages to line up prominent PIPE investors such as Wellington Management, it can provide validation of a proposed business combination, he said. In other cases, some PIPE investors are not even identified by name.</p><p>The value proposition for a company to go with a SPAC buyer is that the company will go public, if that's something that the seller wants. SPACs may often be able to outbid private-equity firms in some situations, especially if they're able to line up PIPE investors to back the deal.</p><p>Up until about 2019, SPACs for many years were seen as useful vehicles for companies that were unlikely to be able to do a traditional IPO. But Wall Street and private-equity firms started wading into them more frequently over the past two years, and have been reaping the benefits that flow from deals and sponsorship.</p><p>White shoe firms such as Goldman Sachs GS and private-equity firms such as TPG raised the profile of the deal type.</p><p>Investors also warmed up to SPACs as a source of potential returns in a low interest environment.</p><p>Breakin:Bakkt shares jump 25% on news of Mastercard partnership, after recently going public via SPAC</p>",
