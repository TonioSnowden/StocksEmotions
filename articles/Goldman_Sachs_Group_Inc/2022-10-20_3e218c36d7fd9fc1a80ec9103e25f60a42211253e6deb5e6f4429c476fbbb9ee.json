  "title": "Technology:  Goldman  Pushes  Engineers  Into Light  ----  By Katie Deighton",
  "text": "<p>    Goldman Sachs Group Inc. wants to bring more software developers and engineers out of backrooms and deeper into the business as the bank embarks on a sweeping reorganization to place greater weight on its client services offerings. </p><p>   The bank is trying to improve the developer experience for both internal and external workers and is rewriting processes so that developers are more engaged with business goals from the beginning of projects, said  Marco Argenti, Goldman's chief information officer. </p><p>   Historically, developers were asking \"how\" questions, Mr. Argenti said Wednesday during an online Wall Street Journal CIO Network members event. </p><p>   \"Now, we want them to answer the 'why' questions\" that get to the business purpose behind their work, he said. \"That is a big change.\" </p><p>   Mr. Argenti became Goldman's sole chief information officer this month in a move that also saw the creation of an Office of Applied Innovation run by former co-CIO George Lee and Jared Cohen, the former CEO of tech incubator Jigsaw, a unit of Alphabet Inc.'s Google. </p><p>   Mr. Argenti joined Goldman in 2019 as co-CIO after serving as vice president of technology at Amazon Web Services. Now, as sole CIO at Goldman, he takes on a role overseeing around 12,000-plus engineers, or one in four people who work at Goldman, according to the company. He also serves on the bank's management committee. </p><p>   Goldman in recent years has begun to focus more on steady, income-generating client services to complement its  trading and investment-banking operations. </p><p></p>",
