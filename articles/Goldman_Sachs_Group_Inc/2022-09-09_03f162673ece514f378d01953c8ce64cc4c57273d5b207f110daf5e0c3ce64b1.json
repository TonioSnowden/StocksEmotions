UK hedge fund <strong>ShadowFall</strong>, which has a short position in the company, has said it overestimates its potential customer base and underspends on research and development compared with peers.</p> <p>Darktrace acknowledged an accounting mistake in its second-quarter results published on Thursday.</p> <p>Thoma Bravo has been quiet on its reasons for cutting bait. But the firm, which is the most active buyer of software companies worldwide, remains interested in downtrodden European markets like the UK.</p> <p>“[The] launch of a London office represents a significant step forward in our ability to partner with some of the best software companies in the world,” said founder <strong>Orlando</strong> <strong>Bravo</strong>.</p> <p>US-based buyout groups such as <strong>Apollo</strong> <strong>Global</strong> have abandoned a string of deals in London like pharmacy chain <strong>Boots </strong>and<strong> Pearson</strong>, underscoring the challenges of getting deals in the UK done.</p> <p>The emergence of Thoma Bravo will have London bankers salivating, nonetheless. </p> <p>Thoma Bravo has done deals at a furious pace in recent years, privatising about a dozen public companies since 2020. It has just raised a further $25bn in new investor money that will increasingly be directed to the UK.</p> <h1>Finders aren't necessarily keepers</h1> <p>Last month, a group of optimistic minority investors in <strong>Revlon </strong>sought to convince debt holders of the distressed cosmetics company that it was due to be the next <strong>Hertz</strong>. </p> <p>That's to say that the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8a1793b-9586-43cd-9e35-006ede4859c3\">unexpected jolt</a> in its share price in late June, less than a week after it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/65370f08-2378-4da0-83c7-05bf9c519750\">filed for bankruptcy</a>, was more than just a meme stock-like phenomenon. But the temporary surge has proven to be just that. </p> <p>Revlon's drama returned on Thursday when a US appeals court <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/94479e58-8fce-4c38-bba6-2cba60a2f793\">ruled in favour</a> of <strong>Citigroup</strong> in its effort to claw back about $500mn of its own money that it wired to the cosmetics company's lenders by mistake, DD's Sujeet Indap and the FT's Josh Franklin report.</p> <p>The feud stemmed from a $900mn term loan administered by Citi on behalf of Revlon. In August 2021, the Wall Street bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a50cd095-2811-41ab-b783-b09944691019\">accidentally repaid</a> the full principal balance instead of making only an $8mn intended interest payment. </p> <p>The lipstick and mascara maker had been in the midst of contentious debt restructuring that pitted various creditors and the company against each other. While holders of $400mn of the loan quickly returned the money to Citigroup, funds including <strong>Brigade Capital Management </strong>and<strong> HPS Investment Partners</strong> refused to send the cash back.</p> <p>A federal judge sided with the hedge funds last year, ruling that they should be able to keep the money on the guise that they had no reason to believe the payment was an accident. </p> <p>But the 2nd Circuit US Court of Appeals in New York rejected that reasoning, writing that Brigade, HPS and the other lenders “are not shielded from Citibank's claims for restitution”, and that they were aware of “red warning flags consisting of facts suggestive of accident or mistake”.</p> <p>The case will now be sent back to the lower court to redecide based on its new guidance. </p> <p>Revlon, which has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/475c0a97-b26f-4687-a775-fcc01253d1ba\">struggled</a> to keep up with savvier social media-driven rivals or adapt to the post-pandemic beauty market that favours higher-end brands, now faces the prospect of footing the bill for the returned funds.</p> <p>The ongoing legal saga could also spell trouble for New York billionaire<strong> Ron Perelman</strong>, whose 83 per cent stake in Revlon could diminish in value if the bankruptcy case goes south. </p> <p>The tabloid-famous debt financier has parted with his<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2022/01/31/ron-perelman-sells-hamptons-estate-for-84-5m/\"> oceanfront East Hampton estate</a> and pieces from his vast art collection among other assets as Revlon's financial situation worsens.</p> <h1>Oligarchs play the blame game</h1> <p>It has never been a worse time to be a Russian oligarch. Villas<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56df1dc0-6cf3-41f8-a644-d44be5085ee8#post-ee93902c-a5c9-4150-a801-6f7641a2699b\"> have been seized</a>, superyachts have been<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/36cbbecc-b8e0-4237-babe-c223b8e8542f#post-e5cbab70-f11c-4f76-9014-7af7cb977bda\"> auctioned off</a>, and a <strong>Premier League</strong> football club has fallen upon new <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f7385ebc-d657-4116-be0f-96497e5f8d99\">ownership</a>.</p> <p>One might presume that the sanctions preventing Russian tycoons from maintaining their fortunes in the west could motivate a “palace coup” against the Kremlin.</p> <p>But that isn't the case, our FT colleagues Max Seddon and Polina Ivanova found while reporting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/daee2387-6d96-4f2e-9a80-5cc70cd8cc67\">this Big Read</a>.</p> <p>Through interviews with seven sanctioned Russian oligarchs and other sources, a picture emerged of a group of oligarchs embittered by both Putin <em>and </em>his western foes, which they believe have scapegoated them for events beyond their control.</p> <p>Two notable Russian businessmen challenging the sanctions against them are <strong>Mikhail Fridman</strong> and <strong>Petr Aven</strong>. Together they built a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2797a5ec-9c02-47dc-ad13-b4348edb51e7\">London-based empire</a> after selling their stake in oil major <strong>TNK-BP</strong> to state-run giant <strong>Rosneft </strong>for $14bn in 2013 and forming investment firm <strong>LetterOne</strong>.</p> <p>“The guys are really pissed off and frustrated,” said a senior banker, who knows the two oligarchs well. “They are energetic people and fighters but it's a very difficult fight.”</p> <p>The view that oligarchs have little sway against Putin's regime isn't unheard of. “There are two kinds of oligarchs in Russia,” said<strong> Michael McFaul</strong>, a former US ambassador to Moscow. “There are the 1990s oligarchs, and we're all very proud when we sanction them and their yachts get taken. But let's be clear: those guys have zero influence over Vladimir Putin.”</p> <p>The other kind, McFaul added, hold business interests that are too intertwined with Putin's affairs to challenge his authority.</p> <p>Many oligarchs hold similar fears. “They say they are scared of being poisoned, but what they are really worried about losing is their money and reputations,” said a senior Russian businessman.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Addy Loudiadis</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d24acaa8-2d53-47aa-8e30-a4114b853981\">is stepping down</a> as chief executive of <strong>Rothesay</strong>, a pensions insurance specialist she co-founded within <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> 15 years ago. She will be replaced by Rothesay managing director <strong>Tom Pearce</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Shopify</strong> has named <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> banker <strong>Jeff Hoffmeister</strong> as chief financial officer, succeeding<strong> Amy Shapero</strong>, who is stepping down in October. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Francisco Partners </strong>has hired<strong> Ashley Evans</strong> as a partner focusing on software investments. She was a managing director at <strong>Carlyle Group</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Latham &amp; Watkins</strong> has hired <strong>Alejandro Ortiz</strong> as an M&amp;A and private equity partner in Madrid.
