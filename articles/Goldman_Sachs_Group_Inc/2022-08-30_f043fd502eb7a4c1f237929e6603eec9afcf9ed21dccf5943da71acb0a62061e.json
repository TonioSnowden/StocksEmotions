  "text": "<p>\"You can't have the stock market collapse over 5% on the words of one man,\" grumbled FWDBONDS ' chief economist Chris Rupkey, who sees a major credibility problem for the central bank. \"Fed officials set the inflation fire ablaze with too much QE and now they say they know what to do now that inflation is out of control. No one believes that.\"</p><p>And as we head into the worst calendar month for Wall Street, economists expectmore hawkishness out of the Fed, and say a strong jobs report on Friday will only shore up rate-hiking resolve.</p><p>So where are the havens? Dividend stocks, the front end of credit markets and Latin American currencies and bonds are just some of the suggestions floating around.</p><p>Our call of the day from Goldman Sachs offers another. They see a buying opportunity via a recent soft patch in commodities and reduce risk elsewhere. They see equities threatened by sticky inflation and a potentially hawkish Fed surprise.</p><p>Commodities are \"the best asset class to own during a late-cycle phase where demand remains above supply. Physical fundamentals signal some of the tightest markets in decades,\" said a team led by senior commodities strategist Sabine Schel in a new note.</p><p>The recent pullback in agricultural and industrial commodities was due to a global recession being priced in by traders. Recession fears have had more of an impact on commodities than on any other asset class, Goldman said. However, the bank believes a recession will be mostly confined to Europe, with the U.S. and China avoiding one.</p><p>It's a matter of just not enough commodities to go around, they say.</p><p>\"As further inventory falls trigger depletion risks, commodity returns for investors are likely to strengthen. Put differently, with the risk of inventory exhaustion significantly greater than the risk of an imminent global economic recession in our view, we believe commodity index backwardation should steepen,\" said Schels.</p><p>Backwardation refers to a premium given for nearby futures prices over contracts for later delivery.</p><p>In keeping with this view, Goldman has raised its forecasts for the S&amp;P GSCI commodity index on a 12-month basis to 38.8%. The bank also sees 12-month returns of 51.7% for the energy sector.</p><p>Goldman says drivers for this commodity run will be \"micro in nature as further price spikes are required to bring demand back in line with supply in the absence of inventories,\" adding that those spikes will create \"extreme\" bouts of backwardation.</p><p>\"In 2000 or [2007-2008], for instance, the depletion of inventories shifted oil markets into a highly volatile pricing regime where extreme price spikes generated substantial backwardation. Even in the absence of significant price appreciation, this can produce exceptionally high returns for investors,\" said Goldman.</p><p>And while backwardation has been most commonly seen in energy, the Goldman team sees it spreading to base metals, notably copper, corn and soy where volatility is likely to increase.</p><p>Specifically, despite strong year-to-date returns, they see energy and agriculture leading. \"With oil the commodity of last resort in an era of severe energy shortages, we believe the pullback in the entire oil complex provides an attractive entry point for long-only investments.\"</p><p>A McKinsey report recently highlighted a worsening situation for global food supply in 2023, owing to war in one of the world's breadbasket — Ukraine — and climate change. The USDA's recent corn report downgraded next year's yield.</p><p>Read: There's a new supercycle emerging for the economy, and these are the stocks that would benefit</p><p>Best of the web</p><p>'Climate catastrophe' in Pakistan as floods kill more than 1,000, wipe out crops</p><p>UN nuclear watchdog monitors are finally on the way to the Zaporizhzhia plant</p><p>High U.K. energy costs mean homeless pet dragons, lizards and cobras</p><p>The chart</p><p>After the S&amp;P 500 failed late last week at 4,200, which has seen the most volume in the last two years, all eyes are on 3,900, Jonathan Krinksy, chief market strategist at BTIG, tells clients.</p><p>Read: Stocks headed for more pain as 3,900 becomes new line in the sand for the S&amp;P 500, chart watchers say</p><p>\"While we remain cautious near-term, we think the June lows will hold as weakness under 4,000 should see sentiment and positioning get bearish enough to create a decent entry point heading into the fourth quarter,\" he said.
