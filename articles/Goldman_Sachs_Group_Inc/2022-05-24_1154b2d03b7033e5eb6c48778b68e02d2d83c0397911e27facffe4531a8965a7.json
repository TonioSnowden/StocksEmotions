  "text": "<p>The shooting occurred Sunday just before noon on a Q train as it crossed the Manhattan Bridge on its way to the Canal Street station in Manhattan, police said. The victim was 48-year-old Daniel Enriquez of Brooklyn, who died at a nearby hospital Sunday.</p><p>Police said Mr. Enriquez was in the last car of the train when a man who had been pacing back and forth pulled out a gun and shot him at close range. The two men had no interaction before the shooting, witnesses told police. None of the other riders in the car were wounded.</p><p>Mr. Enriquez worked in the research division at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., joining the bank in 2013.</p><p>It was the second attack on the nation's largest subway system in weeks. Last month, a man opened fire on a Brooklyn subway train during morning rush hour, injuring 10 people in the attack. Thirteen others were treated for smoke inhalation, panic attacks or falls.</p><p>The suspected gunman in that incident, 62-year-old Frank James, was taken into custody after a 30-hour manhunt. Mr. James faces a terrorism charge and possible life in prison, federal prosecutors said. He has pleaded not guilty.</p><p>Write to Joseph Pisani at joseph.pisani@wsj.com</p><p>New York Subway Shooting Suspect in Custody</p>",
