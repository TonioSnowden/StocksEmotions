  "text": "<p>Italian football club Inter Milan is in talks over&#xa0;a sale&#xa0;to buyout groups including BC Partners and EQT, as private equity looks to extend&#xa0;holdings&#xa0;in football&#xa0;during a&#xa0;financial crisis&#xa0;caused by&#xa0;the coronavirus pandemic.&#xa0;</p> <p>Suning Holdings, the Chinese retail conglomerate that owns a majority stake in Inter Milan, has begun negotiations with various parties over selling some or all of its holdings in the Serie A team, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the talks. One person close to the discussions said the owners value the club at up to €900m.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Chinese group has hired Goldman Sachs to advise on potential fundraising options. Private equity firms including Sweden's EQT and US-based Arctos Sports Partners are among those interested in a deal, according to people with knowledge of the talks, though discussions with London-based BC Partners appear to have progressed the furthest.&#xa0;</p> <p>The talks underline how private equity groups have increasingly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ba35ff2-ac31-41d2-8ff9-6107a64d0ae5\">pushed into sports </a>over the past year, seeking to take advantage of the need to raise money due to coronavirus-induced losses, such as lost ticket sales.</p> <p>CVC Capital Partners and Advent International are in advanced discussions over a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85191ee1-7b0c-4329-bc7a-b1c3338241e9\">€1.6bn deal</a> to invest in Serie A's commercial rights, while Germany's Bundesliga and Spain's La Liga are also talking to private equity investors over similar deals.&#xa0;</p> <p>Inter Milan, led by president <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93b004fa-5e31-11ea-8033-fa40a0d65a98\">Steven Zhang</a>, the 29-year-old son of Zhang Jindong, Suning's billionaire founder who paid €270m for a majority stake in the “Nerazzurri” in 2016, has been seeking to return Inter Milan to the top of Italian and European football.&#xa0;</p> <p>The club has spent hundreds of millions of euros to capture star players such as striker Romelu Lukaku and midfielder Christian Eriksen, in an effort to win its first Serie A title in a decade. Alongside local rivals AC Milan, it has also announced plans to build a €1.3bn stadium by 2023 alongside its existing ground at San Siro.</p> <p>There have been concerns over liquidity at Suning's main business in China, however, while Inter Milan made a pre-tax loss of €102m last season mainly due to revenue shortfalls caused by the pandemic. </p> <p>In September, the English Premier League <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee6507f1-ed7f-40ab-9cbf-08c0212a797b\">terminated</a> its $700m screening deal in China with PPTV, a digital broadcaster owned by Suning, after it sought to withhold payments and renegotiate its contract citing the pandemic.&#xa0;</p> <p>Financial pressures have led Suning, which owns 68.5 per cent of Inter Milan, to seek additional outside investment for the club. It is unclear whether Lionrock Capital, the Hong Kong-based private equity group which owns 31.5 per cent of the club, is also looking to sell its holding.</p> <p>Suning, Inter Milan, Lionrock and BC Partners did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Arctos, EQT and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Silvia Sciorilli Borrelli in Milan, Murad Ahmed, Arash Massoudi and Kaye Wiggins in London, James Fontanella-Khan in New York 2021 'Inter Milan owners in talks over private equity sale ' FT.com 14 January.
