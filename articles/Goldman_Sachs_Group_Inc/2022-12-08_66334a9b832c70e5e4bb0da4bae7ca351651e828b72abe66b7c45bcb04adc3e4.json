  "title": "Hertz Names First CMO Since 2020 Amid New Focus on Electric Vehicles; Wayne Davis says he will promote EVs and work to distinguish Hertz's Dollar and Thrifty brands",
  "text": "<p>Hertz is bringing back the CMO title just under 18 months after it emerged from a pandemic-era bankruptcy and 10 months after the company hired former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr as its new chief executive. The company's most recent chief marketing officer, Jodi Allen, died in 2020.</p><p>The biggest challenge ahead for Hertz, like other travel and hospitality brands, lies in convincing customers to accept prices that are significantly higher than in the prepandemic period, said Chris Woronka, senior analyst at Deutsche Bank AG covering the lodging and leisure industries.</p><p>Two initial areas of focus will be making Hertz more relevant to young consumers by promoting its efforts to electrify its fleet and to distinguish its discount Dollar and Thrifty rental brands, according to Mr. Davis. Encouraging the corporate clients that make up a majority of Hertz's business to use EVs will be another concern, he said.</p><p>Hertz in the coming months plans to more clearly define itself to young consumers, many of whom don't own cars but may be unaware of recent initiatives such as Mr. Scherr's promise to make 25% of Hertz's fleet electric by the end of 2024, Mr. Davis said. As part of that effort, Hertz will also update its mobile app and incorporate the app into more of its marketing materials, he said.</p><p>Hertz recently signed deals to buy EVs from Tesla Inc., Polestar Automotive Holding UK PLC and General Motors Co. It also formed a partnership with ride-share company Uber Technologies Inc. in 2016 that allows Uber drivers to use Hertz-owned cars, and more recently incorporated the Uber partnership into its deal with Tesla.</p><p>Electrification \"speaks to mobility, and it speaks to making Hertz a brand for the future,\" Mr. Davis said.</p><p>In recent months, Hertz leadership has emphasized its loyalty programs as well as its discount brands to \"establish a finer point of differentiation between what is a Hertz branded car and what is a Dollar [or] Thrifty branded car,\" said Mr. Woronka.</p><p>Hertz this month also resolved a longstanding legal matter by agreeing to pay $168 million to settle hundreds of claims from customers who sued the company after allegedly being arrested when the cars they rented were falsely reported as stolen. Hertz denied the claims for years, but Mr. Scherr in April said some customers had been affected in the past by false theft reports and vowed to rectify the situation for wronged customers.</p><p>Hertz has seen strong demand for its services since emerging from bankruptcy, Chief Financial Officer Kenny Cheung said last month. The company reported $2.5 billion in third-quarter revenue, a 12% year-over-year increase.</p><p>Mr. Davis previously spent more than a decade at General Electric's appliances division, which became GE Appliances after being acquired by Haier Smart Home Co. Ltd. in 2016. He was most recently senior director of the Caf√© Appliance brand.</p><p>Write to Patrick Coffee at patrick.coffee@wsj.com</p><p>Hertz Names First CMO Since 2020 Amid New Focus on Electric Vehicles</p>",
