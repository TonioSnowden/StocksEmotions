  "text": "<p>What watch have you given or received as a graduation gift? Join the conversation below.</p><p>With a penchant for vintage, today's grads, who have grown up with the internet at their fingertips (and on their wrists), obsess over old-school watches' mechanical workings and supreme style. \"Young customers come in having been up all night studying on YouTube,\" said Ruediger Albers, U.S. president of watch retailer Wempe. According to Ira Melnitsky, U.S. president and CEO at Tourneau | Bucherer, which has seen an uptick in grad-watch sales in the past three years, the youths \"appreciate a mechanical item that's not disposable.\"</p><p>Nolan Daniel White, 20, a watch-savvy TikTok star, has 142,000 followers who hang on his every recommendation. Gen Zers desire analog accoutrements for \"the same reason people still drive a 1967 Mustang despite the fact that you can buy a Tesla Model 3 that will fully charge for $3,\" he said. They have \"character\" and \"soul.\" Even so, grads won't love just any old watch. Here, a primer on buying worthy timepieces for the class of 2022.</p><p>Timely advice from the experts</p><p>The idea of buying your grad a watch that dates to his or her birth year, as Mr. Shear did, is an approach recommended by many dealers, executives and collectors. Not only is such a watch sweetly sentimental, it can be cost-effective—even if you don't plan ahead. Prices on new watches have been steadily climbing for the last decade, and a secondhand watch from 2000 or 2001, when many of this year's college grads were born, will likely cost less than something box fresh.</p><p>Whether going new or vintage, Steve Kivel, president of Grand Central Watch, a New York store that sells new and used timepieces, recommends capping your spend at $500 for high-school graduates. However, he advocates being less conservative when it comes to shopping for college grads who, one would hope, have learned a thing or two about accountability. He prefers microbrands like Davosa or Baltic to the big names like Tissot, explaining that these companies offer a high quality, often Swiss-made timepiece for a lower cost. \"A Davosa has the same weight and look as a Rolex for a fraction of the price,\" he said.</p><p>If going the vintage route, \"make sure you buy from a seller who is knowledgeable and stands behind their product,\" said Mr. Shear. He has a soft spot for Rolexes old and new because, he said, they tend to retain their value better than watches by many other brands.</p><p>If newness is a must, consider a Tudor, said Italian watch collector Auro Montanari. It's a brand with a long history, now owned by Rolex and selling watches of a comparable design. Should money be no object, Mr. Montanari suggests buying an Omega Speedmaster—the watch worn by Apollo 11 astronauts during the 1969 moon landing. But with a starting price of around $6,000, it's perhaps best suited for offspring who, say, graduated summa cum laude or got an early job offer from NASA to become an actual astronaut.</p><p>Mr. Albers added that anyone in search of a more delicate watch should snap up Cartier's classic Tank. \"In stainless steel it is an entry-level price point and it looks fantastic,\" he said. \"It never goes out of style.\"</p><p>Face it: Your grad might lose the watch </p><p>'Toodaloo!' PHOTO: Errata Carmona</p><p>When Steve Kivel, president of Grand Central Watch, was entering college in the '80s he saved up to buy a Movado watch. Three days into his freshman year, some sophomores swiped it off his desk. \"I couldn't tell my father, but lesson learned,\" he said. His advice to parents when selling them a graduation watch? Give the gift in tandem with a warning about responsibility.</p><p>But talk is cheap, watches are pricey and kids rarely listen, so if you're planning on buying a serious timepiece (particularly one over $3,000), Wempe's Mr. Albers suggests including it on your homeowners insurance. For watch-specific coverage, consider plans from Jewelers Mutual, Zillion or Chubb.</p><p>Six watches to suit all sorts of graduating seniors—no matter their major</p><p>1.
