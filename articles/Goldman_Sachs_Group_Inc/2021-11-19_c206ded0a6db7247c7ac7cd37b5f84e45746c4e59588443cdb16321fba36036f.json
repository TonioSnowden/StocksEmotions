  "text": "<p>At a financial <a href=\"https://events.sifma.org/annual\">industry conference</a> this month, a former government official now with Goldman Sachs introduced a former Goldman banker now in the US government.</p> <p>John Rogers worked in the White House, Treasury and state department before joining Goldman in 1994 and eventually reaching his current position as head of government, investor and media relations.</p> <p>Gary Gensler previously worked at Goldman and subsequently ran the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before starting this year as head of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p> <p>Revelling in his role policing Wall Street, the new SEC chair does not need a reminder that he used to work at Goldman — but Rogers helpfully provided one anyway, highlighting to the conference audience that Gensler, who became one of the company's youngest partners, spent 18 years there.</p> <p>The revolving door between Washington and Wall Street, in particular those moves involving “Government Sachs”, periodically attracts attention and criticism. </p> <p>But at least the conflicts are mostly transparent. And Gensler has proved in his government roles that he is not doing the bidding of his former colleagues. He has become the financial sector's tough cop, pushing for reforms and strict rules. His Goldman experience helped him understand the industry and puncture its special pleadings.</p> <p>There are worse systems. On the other side of the Atlantic, the UK parliament is racked with allegations related to simultaneous public and private work. One MP has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5551a371-fd16-41e7-b247-b3a33f491b13\">caught lobbying</a> on behalf of a company that had him on the payroll. Another was discovered <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7106fab1-03a2-4674-b1e3-3302c7b2ec6f\">working as a barrister</a> in the Caribbean. </p> <p>The excuse is two-fold: MPs should be allowed to supplement their £81,932 annual salary, while time in the real world also helps them stay in touch. (Some members of the US Congress are also unimpressed with their $174,000 annual salary, though their outside work is strictly limited.)</p> <p>But the solution is simple: if politicians feel the need to make more money, return to the private sector. We do not need lawmakers to spend their careers in politics. </p> <p>Equally, there should be less friction for businesspeople to move into government roles. When the Obama administration fought the financial crisis it drafted in investment bankers including Jim Millstein, Ron Bloom and Steven Rattner. Their firefighting, especially in the US auto industry, is widely seen as a success.</p> <p>The UK has recent experience of this — it appointed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8d9edc58-7922-496a-942f-5360bfe84876\">Kate Bingham</a>, a venture capitalist at SV Health Investors, to lead what turned out to be a highly successful Covid-19 vaccine task force. But there is less movement from business into senior government roles.</p> <p>Like a child approaching a real-life revolving door, UK politicians seem confused about how they are supposed to work. Former prime minister David Cameron thought it acceptable to lobby incessantly his former colleagues — ministers and civil servants alike — on behalf of the dubious supply chain finance company Greensill Capital. Now collapsed, Greensill is subject to multiple investigations, including from the Serious Fraud Office.</p> <p>Do not hold your breath. The SFO is hopelessly outgunned and boasts relatively few successful prosecutions. As the <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2021-11-15/city-law-firms-make-millions-while-top-corruption-cases-tumble\">Bureau of Investigative Journalism noted</a> this week, there is a glaring mismatch between London firms that pay junior lawyers £100,000 salaries and the SFO which pays its chief investigator £80,000.</p> <p>This pay gap, though, would matter little if, like the US Department of Justice, the SFO had prestige to attract top lawyers for a spell. The UK sorely needs more effective and independent prosecutors — including as a check on what looks like endemic political corruption. The fix is to install the revolving door.</p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this column:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7459df0a-b10e-48e1-9206-c26ea6d028b1\"><em>SFO's revolving door works better than a closed shop / From Lisa Osofsky, Director, Serious Fraud Office, London SW1, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Tom Braithwaite 2021 'In defence of the revolving door' FT.com 19 November.
