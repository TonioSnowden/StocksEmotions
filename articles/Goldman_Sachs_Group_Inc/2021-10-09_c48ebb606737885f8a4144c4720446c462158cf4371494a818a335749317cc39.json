  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Memory-chip companies rode the Covid-19 wave to record highs. Now that wave has crested and companies will need to figure out how to navigate the trough. Samsung Electronics, with its diversified businesses and market leadership, may weather it better than most. </p><p>\n  Memory-chip stocks have retreated substantially from their peaks earlier this year. Samsung is down 21% since January, while SK Hynix is 37% lower than its February peak. Both are still reporting stellar results: Samsung said Friday that its revenue for last quarter could reach a record of the equivalent of $61 billion, while its operating profit would be the highest in three years. </p><p>\n  The worry is that heightened demand for electronic devices such as personal computers and smartphones may be coming to an end. Spot prices for DRAM, a memory chip for processing, have come off since April. While big suppliers like Samsung don't base their sales on spot prices, weaker prices there could eventually hurt contract prices, too. Market researcher TrendForce expects DRAM contract prices to fall 3% to 8% this quarter from the last. </p><p>\n  Demand for personal computers, which got an unusual bump from the pandemic, may return to a more normal level quite soon. Slowing economic growth in China, the largest smartphone market, may also dent memory-chip demand. And global trade growth as a whole is beginning to slow as well. Even prices for memory chips used in servers could suffer a rare decline as cloud companies have been snapping up chip supply aggressively in the past few quarters and now look well stocked. </p><p>\n  The question for investors is how long and how deep the downturn will be. Memory-chip price cycles have lasted around two to three quarters in the past couple of years, according to Goldman Sachs. That is a shorter cycle compared with previously. One reason is that the industry has become more consolidated. Customers may also prefer to hold more inventory after the disruptions experienced in the past couple of years. </p><p>\n  After a plunge this year, Samsung shares have priced in a big part of the slowdown already -- although the worst of the chip price fall is probably yet to come. But Samsung's other large businesses could help soften the blow compared with smaller rivals. In the long run, the company still looks like a formidable competitor. </p><p></p>",
