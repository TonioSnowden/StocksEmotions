  "title": "Copy of U.S. Constitution Sells for $43.2 Million as Crypto Group DAO Is Outbid; Private collector beat out a group of cryptocurrency investors who raised more than $40 million to buy the historic document",
  "text": "<p>Sotheby's sale on Thursday transforms the governing document into the priciest six pages in auction history, surpassing Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates's $30.8 million copy of Leonardo da Vinci's scientific notebook known as the Codex Leicester. The Constitution also exceeded the $21.3 million paid for a copy of the 1297 Magna Carta by Carlyle Group co-founder David Rubenstein in 2007.</p><p>The winner remains anonymous, but the group pledging the second-highest price was ConstitutionDAO, an online organization that its founders say was formed as a lark last week and wound up pooling donations from 17,437 people to try to win the historic artifact.</p><p>\"What we tried to do was make the Constitution more accessible to the public,\" said core organizer Anisha Sunkerneni of San Francisco. \"Although we might have not completely accomplished doing just that, I think we've raised enough awareness to illustrate that a DAO is another option.\"</p><p>Sotheby's had expected the 1787 folio to sell for up to $20 million.</p><p>If it had been successful, the crowdfunded effort to buy a blue-chip artifact would have marked a major departure for an art market historically steered by the tastes and deep pockets of billionaires. Small consortia and fractionalized ownership of art exist in limited art circles. But the vast effort to determine the destiny of this patriotic artifact is reminiscent of the country's first major crowdfunding experiment when Americans pooled their pennies to put a pedestal beneath New York's Statue of Liberty in 1885.</p><p>ConstitutionDAO is a decentralized autonomous organization formed to put the Constitution into the hands of the people, according to its website. Its organizers said it had 17,437 participants, whose median donation size was $206.26. Participants were told at the outset that contributing to the DAO—essentially an online group with a shared cryptocurrency bank account and mission—wouldn't garner them a fraction of the actual Constitution. Instead, donors were promised governance tokens tagged $PEOPLE that will allow them to vote on where the document should be exhibited or donated, organizers said.</p><p>A giddy prankster atmosphere has pervaded the entire effort, as investors who have never collected anything in real life started donating sums in the cryptocurrency ether. Some advertised their participation on Twitter and Discord with jokes or memes featuring actor Nicolas Cage, who once played an historian seeking to steal the Declaration of Independence. Hours before the sale, a man dressed in colonial garb was seen strolling the sidewalk outside the auction house's York Avenue headquarters in New York carrying a sign that read, \"I'm buying the Constitution.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>If money were no object, how much would you bid on the U.S. Constitution? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Now, the funds will need to be redistributed back to donors, the group said on its website. ConstitutionDAO is working with the crowdfunding platform Juicebox to determine when exactly contributors will get their money back, Ms. Sunkerneni said.</p><p>The fate of the Constitution matters because this 1787 copy is the one of two copies not held in institutional collections like the Library of Congress and Princeton University. It was printed for delegates at the Constitutional Convention and for the Continental Congress more than 230 years ago. More than 27 first printings of the Declaration of Independence survive, but only 13 original copies of the Constitution are still around.</p><p>Kenneth Rendell, a Boston dealer who specializes in historic documents, said people at the time likely sensed the Declaration of Independence would become an iconic souvenir but were still fuzzy on the ramifications of the subsequent Constitution.</p><p>\"People knew they should probably save the Declaration, but it took a while before this constitutional framework affected ordinary people,\" Mr. Rendell said. \"Of course now everyone is running to the Constitution for protection and all our biggest issues feel like constitutional questions.\"</p><p>In traditional collecting circles, the value of a historic document often depends on the significance of what is written, with collectors paying anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000 for a Thomas Jefferson-signed letter depending on the sentiments divulged. Mr. Rendell said he didn't expect the Constitution copy to sell for more than $25 million.</p><p>Before the sale, Sotheby's went into marketing overdrive to drum up broader interest in the document by sandwiching it between high-profile sales of contemporary art rather than fold it into next week's sale of the rest of seller Dorothy Tapper Goldman's rare books and manuscripts. Among those artifacts still up for bid is the first separate printing of the Bill of Rights, which has an estimate of at least $700,000.</p><p>Write to Kelly Crow at kelly.crow@wsj.com and Omar Abdel-Baqui at Omar.Abdel-Baqui@wsj.com</p><p>Copy of U.S. Constitution Sells for $43.2 Million as Crypto Group DAO Is Outbid</p>",
