  "text": "<p>Reckitt Benckiser has begun a sale process for its baby formula business that could fetch $7bn to $10bn and would complete the unwinding of the consumer group's largest-ever acquisition, the purchase of Mead Johnson five years ago.</p> <p>Two people familiar with the situation said Reckitt had sent out marketing materials this month for the remainder of the business, whose Chinese unit was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2ec2477-1f7e-49c0-9e4c-ed9fb30a8513\">sold last year for $2.2bn</a> to local private equity group Primavera.</p> <p>The company could seek as much as $10bn for the business, said one of the people. But James Edwardes Jones, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said that figure “sounds ambitious to us given the strategic headwinds that would prompt Reckitt to make this disposal”.</p> <p>At the time of the China disposal Reckitt said the remaining baby formula business had about £5.4bn of net assets.&#xa0;</p> <p>Reckitt, which also makes household products such as Dettol and Lysol disinfectants and personal care products including Durex condoms, has already written off £8bn of the £13bn Mead Johnson takeover, which was spearheaded by former chief executive Rakesh Kapoor.</p> <p>The infant formula business, whose brands include Enfamil, has suffered from declining birth rates exacerbated by Covid-19, while the Chinese operation had been hurt by new regulations favouring local rivals. It competes with Nestlé and Danone internationally.</p> <p>Revenues from the infant nutrition business rose 3 per cent on a like-for-like basis in 2021, Reckitt said, with specialist formula such as products aimed at babies with allergies faring far better than mainstream products.</p> <p>The broader nutrition division recorded £2.3bn of total net revenues in 2021; Edwardes Jones said roughly 85 per cent of sales in that division came from infant formula, with the US market accounting for about half of that.</p> <p>Bids for the business are expected at the end of May, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the sale process. Goldman Sachs is advising Reckitt. Reckitt declined to comment.</p> <p>Chief executive Laxman Narasimhan, a former PepsiCo executive who took over in 2019, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6c2ff6a-2e92-467b-afee-059f29bc85a5\">unwound </a>a series of Kapoor's initiatives including a planned split into two divisions — one for health and the other for hygiene and home products — that had been seen as a precursor to a potential break-up of the company.</p> <p>Demand for Reckitt's disinfectants rocketed at the start of the pandemic as households and businesses stepped up their hygiene routines.</p> <p>Shares in the group are 1 per cent above their level at the start of 2020, at £62.82. Reckitt is due to report first-quarter results on Friday.</p><p>Source: Judith Evans 2022 'Reckitt Benckiser seeks up to $10bn for remainder of infant milk business' FT.com 26 April.
