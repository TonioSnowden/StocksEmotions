  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start</strong>: rail group <strong>Canadian Pacific </strong>is set to present a new, higher offer to buy <strong>Kansas City Southern</strong>, worth about $31bn, including debt, in a move that is set to revive the takeover battle for the US freight railroad group with arch-rival <strong>Canadian National</strong>, people briefed about the matter told DD. Full story <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/78e33524-734b-4cff-9f9b-b73611498c5f?edit=true\">here</a>.</p> <h2>How SoftBank handled an insider-trading question</h2> <p>When <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong> speaks about strengthening governance at <strong>SoftBank</strong>, investors have often listened with half an ear.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25f76710-fbde-11e9-98fd-4d6c20050229\">chaotic sagas</a> of<strong> WeWork</strong> and <strong>Greensill Capital</strong> have forced the founder of the world's most aggressive investment group to pay attention to compliance and governance. But Son's spontaneity won't be easily tamed.</p> <p>Case in point: when <strong>Yuko Kawamoto</strong>, an expert on corporate governance and the group's first female director, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d6d6593-78e2-49d1-9477-7227725b8e98\">stepped down</a> in May, she left a highly unusual <a href=\"https://group.softbank/en/news/info/20210521\">departing note</a> highlighting those exact risks for SoftBank's governance: “Although the direction, speed, ideas and energy are all considered great, sometimes the rules and systems are not checked in time to make decisions.”</p> <p>In May last year SoftBank faced internal scrutiny on whether it was close to overstepping insider dealing rules. </p> <p>According to internal exchanges described to the FT's Tokyo team, the issue revolved around the legal complexities of whether it was possible for SoftBank to revise the terms of its $23bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad5785da-6cd3-11ea-89df-41bea055720b\">stock repurchase programme</a>, while the company's board was also finalising the sale of its stake in the US carrier <strong>T-Mobile</strong>.</p> <p>If the T-Mobile transaction constituted share-moving, material non-public information, then SoftBank would've needed to either stop the share buyback or halt discussions on T-Mobile.</p> <p>Outside legal opinion was divided: one could argue that the T-Mobile deal was uncertain and therefore didn't require disclosure — but others disagreed, saying discussions that reached board level would be considered material non-public information. In the end, no definitive conclusion was reached.&#xa0;</p> <p>What made people inside the company uncomfortable was that SoftBank decided to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/31a97139-ebd3-42d8-950e-965280c4b693\">formally declare</a> the terms of the buyback in June without a clear answer on the issue.</p> <p>The company declined to comment specifically, but it confirmed that its relevant departments co-ordinated closely to examine the legal and regulatory implications of the business decisions under consideration so that appropriate decisions were made.</p> <p>The T-Mobile issue is one of several incidents over the past year leading both existing and former executives to question the company's compliance structure, as the FT's Kana Inagaki and Leo Lewis explore further in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/107fe840-1874-4fb2-a70b-f2f8f1381215\">this in-depth piece</a>.</p> <p>Tim Mackey, chief compliance officer and chief legal officer, has told employees he wants to build a transparent culture where they can express concerns. Son himself “shares the view that employees should speak up,” one person close to the company said.&#xa0;</p> <p>For now, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71ad7cda-6ef4-11e8-92d3-6c13e5c92914\">“wild west” culture</a> of SoftBank's first Vision Fund seems alive and well, if the views of another person close to the company are anything to go by: “If Masa had already said yes, who am I to object?”&#xa0;</p> <h2>Italy's game of luxury thrones</h2> <p>The billionaire battle for the Italian luxury house <strong>Gucci</strong> — waged in the late 1990s by French rivals <strong>Bernard Arnault</strong>, head of the<strong> LVMH </strong>empire, and <strong>Kering </strong>chair <strong>François Pinault</strong> — <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/11/business/pinault-wins-long-battle-to-control-gucci-group.html\">was coined</a> “one of the most bitter fights in corporate history”.</p> <p>Suffering a crushing defeat to Pinault in 1999, Arnault later returned to Italy to scoop up one of Gucci's biggest rivals, claiming a majority share in <strong>Fendi</strong> in 2001.</p> <p>Through all the dealmaking drama, one legendary Italian designer has steadfastly clung to his crown all these years: 87-year-old <strong>Giorgio Armani</strong>, known in Italy as “King Giorgio”.&#xa0;</p> <p>That could soon change, however, as the pandemic has accelerated Italian luxury mergers and acquisitions activity to record highs, the FT's Leila Abboud <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fff8a9d-7a94-4d0f-8027-91606d0ef246\">reports</a>.</p> <p>First came the menswear designer <strong>Ermenegildo Zegna Group</strong>, which unveiled plans to go public through a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c729cad3-b28a-41eb-890c-0b3a9112c4af\">Spac deal</a> that valued it at $3.2bn and hinted it was open to making acquisitions. Then Italy's<strong> Etro</strong> family sold a majority stake in their fashion house for €500m to the LVMH-backed private equity firm <strong>L Catterton</strong>.</p> <p>But Armani has evaded the French luxury giants thus far and long insisted on maintaining control over his company. Then came a sign that his thinking had evolved when he told <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/giorgio-armani-on-fashions-future\">Vogue</a> magazine in April that remaining independent was “not so strictly necessary”.</p> <p>It seemed to be an invitation to potential bidders. People familiar with the matter told the FT that Armani subsequently held talks with the billionaire <strong>Agnelli</strong> family but they didn't lead to an official offer.</p> <p>The idea of an Italian luxury tie-up is still a novel one. <strong>Moncler</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e6100bb-5a53-45be-8f1b-252bca01ccdf\">boss</a> <strong>Remo Ruffini</strong>'s recent acquisition of domestic rival <strong>Stone Island</strong> has only just forged “a new path that is different from the old choice of either remaining independent but small, or simply selling to the French”, as put by <strong>Citigroup</strong>'s global luxury investment banking head <strong>Roberto Costa</strong>.</p> <p>Still, French buyers loom large. Kering has made no secret of its openness to acquisitions, and LVMH is practically the default buyer in the sector, according to bankers.</p> <p>Even if Armani does join forces with an Italian buyer, it will be difficult to match the empires that the French billionaires have built.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h2>Big Tobacco versus Big Private Equity</h2> <p><strong>Vectura</strong> is an inhaler company, headquartered on an unassuming industrial estate outside the historic English market town of Chippenham.&#xa0;</p> <p>It's also the target in a bitterly fought takeover battle between two New York-based rivals that pits Big Tobacco against Big Private Equity, DD's Kaye Wiggins <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab7753be-8bc8-4e0d-b00e-edcae1809b18\">reports</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Philip Morris International</strong>, which sells <strong>Marlboro</strong> cigarettes, wants to use its “capabilities in inhalation” to produce medical treatments — and sees acquiring Vectura as an important part of that plan.</p> <p><strong>Carlyle</strong>, the New York-based private equity firm, wants to pump more of its investors' money into European healthcare firms in search of higher returns, having hired former <strong>GlaxoSmithKline</strong> chief financial officer <strong>Simon Dingemans</strong> with that remit last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>That has led to some mudslinging between the two parties, neither of whose industries enjoy an elevated position in the court of public opinion. PMI called private equity “short-term” and Carlyle pointed to the potential impact of a sale to Big Tobacco on “wider stakeholders”.</p> <p>Facing a choice between two very different futures, what does Vectura want? The highest price, it seems.&#xa0;</p> <p>On Monday, after the UK's <strong>Takeover Panel</strong> took the rare move of stepping in to force an auction, Vectura's board backed neither side and said it would decide at the end of the process “based on its fiduciary duties”.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's despite warnings from two medical societies that they deny membership to those with links to tobacco.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The real problem here is that Vectura's board hasn't seized control of deciding what is in the best interests of the company,” the FT's Helen Thomas <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43660a2d-7bf5-4770-90b5-b81a3cc01caf\">writes</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Deep-pocketed PMI, which is desperate to get into what it calls the “beyond nicotine” market, might be well-placed for a battle on price.</p> <p>Still, Vectura's board can make its own decision when the auction ends — and price doesn't have to carry the day, Helen writes. Deciding not to go with the highest offer would be complicated and potentially messy, but not impossible.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Asda </strong>chief executive <strong>Roger Burnley</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/163d92fa-d227-4877-8554-406ee0fa0335\">has exited</a> the UK supermarket chain earlier than anticipated as its new owners <strong>Mohsin </strong>and <strong>Zuber Issa</strong> increase operational control. They will be working closely with chief operating officer <strong>Anthony Hemmerdinger</strong> while recruiting a replacement.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Latham &amp; Watkins</strong> has named <strong>Alex Martin</strong> as a partner in its structured finance practice based in London.

She was previously the chief financial officer and chief operating officer of <strong>T Rowe Price</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Diversity and exclusion </strong>Silicon Valley executives sometimes pride themselves on diversity, but the data shows that Big Tech campuses lack Black and Hispanic staff, while Asians, though represented numerically, still face rampant discrimination.
