  "text": "<p>* The yield on the 2-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD02Y rose 1.6 basis points to 4.245% from 4.229% on Tuesday. Yields move in the opposite direction to prices.</p><p>* The yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y was slightly higher at 3.503% versus 3.501% Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>* The yield on the 30-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD30Y advanced 1.2 basis points to 3.539% after factoring in reopening levels.</p><p>What drove markets</p><p>On Wednesday, Fed policy makers raised their benchmark interest rate target by 50 basis points, to between 4.25% and 4.5%, and signaled more tightening is on the way in 2023. The median forecast for the fed-funds rate in 2023 rose to 5.1%, up from the 4.6% estimate made in September.</p><p>During a postmeeting news conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that \"we have more work to do\" even after Wednesday's action and he stressed the need to restore price stability. Powell also echoed language in the Fed's statement by saying that policy makers continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the fed-funds rate target \"will be appropriate,\" and that the central bank will keep shrinking its balance sheet.

As a result, markets were \"backing out some of the euphoria that built up in the last few weeks,\" when there was growing expectation the central bank would not only stop raising rates soon, but begin easing next year, Beaulieu wrote in an email to MarketWatch. Fed-funds futures traders now see a 60.4% chance of a 25-basis-point rate hike at the Fed's February meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool. They also saw a 34.7% chance of a 50-basis-point hike that month, and 4.9% chance of a 75 basis point hike.</p><p>Benchmark 10-year gilt yields BX:TMBMKGB-10Y rose 1.7 basis points to 3.313% afterU.K. inflationdipped to 10.7% in November from 11.1% in October. The Bank of England is expected to increase interest rates by 50 basis points, to 3.5%, after its Thursday meeting.</p><p>What analysts are saying</p><p>* \"What surprised the market was the revision higher to the FOMC's expectations of where rate hikes could go in 2023, and the Fed signaling that it intends to keep rates high through next year â€” underscoring its commitment to undermining inflation even if it comes at the expense of economic growth,\" said Craig Fehr, principal and investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis. \"Our view is that something around the 5% level is ultimately going to prove to be the peak.\"</p><p>* \"The Fed's more hawkish projections than what the market has been pricing for the terminal rate next year are consistent with the views we have previously articulated that the Fed will have to continue to raise interest rates to 5% or higher and keep them there to anchor inflation expectations close to their target of 2%,\" said Maria Vassalou, co-chief investment officer of multiasset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"The market's optimism about a lower terminal rate and cuts in the second half of next year have been working against the Fed and are unrealistic in our view, unless we see a financial crisis or drain of liquidity in the markets that will [require] the Fed to step in and lower rates. In all other cases, we expect the Fed to hike to above 5% and stay there,\" Vassalou wrote in an email.</p><p>Treasury yields advance after Fed signals more tightening is coming in 2023</p>",
