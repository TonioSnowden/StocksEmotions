  "title": "Stock Picking Makes a Comeback in Market Turbulence; Inflation, rising interest rates and recession fears derail easy returns from passive investing",
  "text": "<p>Stock pickers had a tough time during the decade after the 2008 financial crisis, as a monster run in big technology stocks powered a bull market that drove major indexes to dozens of new highs.</p><p>Stocks such as Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. became so big that they dominated the S&amp;P 500, which is weighted by market value. Investors poured money into passive investments that tracked the index, earning easy returns as those shares soared. Stock pickers who actively managed their funds struggled to compete.</p><p>Conditions have since changed.</p><p>Red-hot inflation, higher interest rates and worries about a potential recession have created new winners and losers in the stock market. Investors have bailed out of big tech stocks and instead snapped up shares of energy companies and other defensive stocks that stand to fare better in a downturn.</p><p>Those shares, however, have a much smaller influence on the direction of the broader market. With Big Tech displaced from the market's leaderboard, the percentage of stocks outperforming the S&amp;P 500 as of Monday was the highest in roughly two decades, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>That has opened a window for stock pickers, many of whom have still suffered losses, even if they squeaked past their benchmarks. Actively managed U.S. open-end funds had a negative total return of 5.8% through November, according to Morningstar Direct.</p><p>\"Buy an exchange-traded fund and everything is going to go wellâ€”that's not going to work anymore,\" said Justin Burgin, head of equity research at Ameriprise Financial. Mr. Burgin said investors have to find attractive stocks instead of just buying and holding an index fund.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has fallen 20% in 2022 and is on pace for its worst year since 2008. (An equal-weighted version of the index that gives the same status to both the smallest and largest companies is down a more modest 14%.)</p><p>The outlook for next year remains murky as well. Although inflation has begun to cool, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated last week that the central bank isn't done lifting rates and said he expects them to rise higher next year than previously forecast.</p><p>Higher rates have sapped the appeal of tech and other growth stocks because they lower the future value of their projected earnings. Apple shares have fallen roughly 25% in 2022, Amazon has lost about 50%, and Microsoft has slumped around 30%.</p><p>Many investors say the tech industry's hardships often filter through the economy.</p><p>\"This is the most expected recession I've ever seen in my career, and it's going to shock people when it actually happens,\" said Michael Kelly, global head of multi-asset at PineBridge Investments. Mr. Kelly said investors should buy stocks, such as those of energy companies and long-duration growth stocks, that can power through a recessionary environment.</p><p>Some of the market's biggest winners in 2022 include Exxon Mobil Corp., up 74%; gas and power company PG&amp;E Corp., up 31%; and fertilizer manufacturer CF Industries Holdings Inc., up 32%.</p><p>Analysts say they expect active strategies to extend their dominance next year, largely because the S&amp;P 500 is still top-heavy. The five largest companies represent more than 20% of the index, above the peak levels during the tech bubble, according to Bank of America analysts.</p><p>To be sure, passive funds still account for 55% of all assets under management at U.S. exchange-traded funds and mutual funds, Goldman Sachs data show. And investors have poured a net $520 billion in U.S.-based passively managed open-end funds and ETFs this year, while pulling $805 billion from actively managed funds, according to Morningstar Direct data through November.</p><p>\"You need to check your weights, you need to better manage risk in the portfolio because all of that has mattered again,\" said Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management. \"You were able to just buy Apple or Amazon or Tesla [Inc.] and you know your risk-adjusted returns were great because the stocks only moved in one direction.\"</p><p>Despite their change in fortunes this year, many investors are hesitant to turn their back on Big Tech.</p><p>Mr. Burgin from Ameriprise said he wouldn't bet against Microsoft and Apple because of the ubiquity of their products. His firm, for example, uses Microsoft Teams and other Microsoft products, and he said he doesn't expect that to change.</p><p>\"I know a lot of people that would skip their rent payments to get a new iPhone,\" Mr. Burgin said.</p><p>Stock Picking Makes a Comeback in Market Turbulence</p>",
