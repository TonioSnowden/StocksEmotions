The London-based business, which invests in private equity and hedge fund firms that collectively manage $187 billion in assets, is tapping into global investors' desire for juicy returns amid perennially low interest rates. The deal, which would see Petershill's vehicle as a stand-alone company operated by Goldman Sachs Asset Management, could value it at more than $5 billion, said people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Falfurrias Capital Partners has raised $850 million for its fifth fund, exceeding the Charlotte, N.C.-based firm's fundraising goal, Chris Cumming reports, citing regulatory filings and people familiar with the offering. The firm launched the vehicle, Falfurrias Capital Partners V LP, with an initial fundraising goal of $800 million, WSJ Pro Private Equity reported this year.

Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.</p><p>Nashville, Tenn.-based lower midmarket firm Gen Cap America Inc. has acquired laboratory research and animal housing equipment manufacturer Lab Products LLC and metal fabrication company Harford Systems from Avidity Science LLC.

The Spanish company is in advanced negotiations with Portobello about the division, which includes Ferrovial's services activities that weren't sold to Germany's Schwarz Group in July, Expansion says. The activities sold to Schwarz fetched more than EUR1.1 billion. Ferrovial declined to comment on the report to Dow Jones Newswires.</p><p>People</p><p>L37 Ventures, a firm that invests across venture capital, private equity and other alternative assets, said it has added two new partners to its ranks.

Mr. Tilney previously spent years on the growth investment team at San Francisco-based RS Investments, while Mr. Park's career included experience with Huron Consulting Group, Ernst &amp; Young, CIT Group and Citigroup, according to a press release.</p><p>Funds</p><p>Asset manager Baring Private Equity Asia is picking up investor capital for its largest ever fund to invest across the Asia-Pacific region, Preeti Singh writes for WSJ Pro. The Hong Kong-based firm's latest fund, Baring Asia Private Equity Fund VIII LP, is targeting $8.5 billion of investor capital, people familiar with the matter said. If the firm reaches that amount, the new fund would be nearly 31% larger than its predecessor, which wrapped up with $6.5 billion in 2019.</p><p>Stockholm-based private equity firm Trill Impact, an independent private investment firm backed by Nordea Asset Management, has announced it has closed €900 million in commitments, the equivalent of $1.07 billion, for its inaugural impact mid-market buyout fund, Lina Saigol writes for sister publication Private Equity News.
