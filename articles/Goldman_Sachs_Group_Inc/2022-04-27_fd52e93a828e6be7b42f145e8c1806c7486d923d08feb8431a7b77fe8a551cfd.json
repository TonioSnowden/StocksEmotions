  "title": "U.S. News: Negative Ads Color Senate GOP Primary --- Pennsylvania hopefuls McCormick and Oz try to tarnish each other with big spending",
  "text": "<p>Mr. McCormick, 56 years old, is a West Point graduate and former Treasury Department official who until January ran the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates. Mr. Oz, 61, is a physician and star of \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" the health-focused program that ended its 13-season television run in January.</p><p>Now, each man is trying to turn the other's accomplishments into liabilities. Mr. Oz's campaign casts Mr. McCormick as a \"Wall Street insider\" and highlights his former firm's investments in China. Mr. McCormick's allies portray Mr. Oz as a \"Hollywood liberal\" who has called for gun restrictions and praised Hillary Clinton and Dr. Anthony Fauci, whom most conservatives deeply dislike.</p><p>Each says the other is insincere in backing the Trump-style \"America First\"\" principles that many GOP voters support, though Mr. Oz won help in blunting that argument when former President Donald Trump endorsed him this month.</p><p>\"All you're really hearing is them dissing each other,\" said Maryann Bricker, a Republican voter in the central Pennsylvania borough of Carlisle. \"It's all very confusing to me, because you don't know what to believe.\" Her takeaway: \"I don't personally care for either one of those candidates.\"</p><p>While negative ads are a staple of political campaigns, voters in Pennsylvania have little prior information to help them judge what they are hearing, as neither Messrs. McCormick nor Oz has run for office before or taken a high profile in the state's civic life. Though both have Pennsylvania roots, they had lived elsewhere for much of their adult lives and moved back only recently.</p><p>Both parties say the Pennsylvania race is particularly important in determining control of the Senate next year, one reason it has drawn significant campaign spending. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is retiring, creating the only open GOP-held seat this cycle in a state President Biden carried in 2020.</p><p>Because it is easier to win an open seat than to defeat an incumbent, Democrats see a pickup opportunity. The winner of the May 17 GOP primary will compete in November against the winner of the Democratic contest, in which Lt. Gov John Fetterman and Rep. Conor Lamb are the leading candidates.</p><p>Both Messrs. McCormick and Oz have used their wealth to push to the front of the multicandidate scramble for the GOP nomination. Mr. McCormick has lent his campaign nearly $7 million and Mr. Oz about $11 million, Federal Election Commission records show. The money, combined with millions of dollars from allied groups, has funded the second-most expensive Senate primary of the year so far as measured by TV ads, after the Republican contest in Ohio, data from the ad-tracking firm AdImpact shows.</p><p>Other Republicans in the May 17 primary include Carla Sands, the U.S. ambassador to Denmark under Mr. Trump; businessman Jeff Bartos, the GOP's nominee for lieutenant governor in 2018; and Kathy Barnette, an author and Fox News contributor.</p><p>The scant polling in the race shows Messrs. McCormick and Oz leading the field, but tentatively. Few polls show any candidate winning more than one-quarter of the vote.</p><p>More than 40% of Republicans had yet to pick a candidate in a recent Franklin &amp; Marshall College poll, and only a third said they were firmly decided. More GOP voters had an unfavorable view of Mr. Oz than a favorable view -- 39% to 27%. Mr. McCormick's image was more favorable than unfavorable, but half of voters said they didn't know enough to give an opinion.</p><p>For Mr. McCormick, Wall Street ties are a point of sensitivity. Connections to the finance sector have helped him raise significant sums: More than 60 employees of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. contributed to his campaign during the first quarter of 2022, FEC records show. Mr. McCormick is married to Goldman partner Dina Powell McCormick, a senior national security official in the Trump administration.</p><p>His backers also include hedge-fund billionaire Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel, who has given $7.5 million to a pro-McCormick super PAC that has spent more on TV ads on the race than any other entity.</p><p>Mr. Oz, for his part, has been working to rebut claims that his past statements show him sympathetic to some restrictions on guns and natural-gas fracking. \"And they are saying Mehmet is not a conservative? What a bunch of crap,\" said Ben Carson, the housing secretary under Mr. Trump, at an appearance Thursday with Mr. Oz.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
