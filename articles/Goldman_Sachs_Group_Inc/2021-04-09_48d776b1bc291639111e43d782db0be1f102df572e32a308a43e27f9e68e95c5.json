  "title": "The curious online popularity of M&A adviser Zaoui",
  "text": "<h2>Zaoui: hostile makeover</h2> <p>One of the City's best-known merger and acquisition advisers has denied engaging in search engine cybersquatting to generate business leads.*</p> <p>A Google search for the boutique bank Robey Warshaw delivered as top result an advert for Zaoui &amp; Co, a rival advisory firm run by brothers Michael and Yoel Zaoui. Keyword searches involving LionTree and Qatalyst returned the same ad for Zaoui above the more likely targets, LionTree Advisors and Qatalyst Partners.</p> <p>Zaoui's advert also attached itself to search terms including “Gordon Dyal” and “Gordon Dyal wife”, which refer to the former Goldman Sachs banker's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d59b1ac-1140-11e9-a581-4ff78404524e\">self-named boutique</a> set up in 2015. His wife Jill is chief operating and financial officer. </p> <p>Since 2009, Google has given advertisers a free rein to bid for nearly any keyword search term, even when they include another company's trademarked brand. </p> <p>Zaoui has since said that the only keyword search terms it owns include the name Zaoui and the view that it appeared to have been engaged in search engine cyber squatting is incorrect.</p> <h2>Berkeley: Sands' castle</h2> <p>Housebuilder Berkeley this week recruited to its board Sarah Sands, the former editor of the London Evening Standard and BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She and chief executive Rob Perrins should have plenty to talk about. </p> <p>Sands is a gentrification sceptic. Writing <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/sarah-sands-there-really-is-no-substitute-for-excellence-a3100111.html\">in 2015</a> she complained that “the capital is in danger of losing its edge” because of rapacious developers, arguing: “It turns out that not even people who can afford luxury flats want to live in residential ghettos”. In a report from the 2016 mayoral election hustings, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/sarah-sands-we-cannot-take-creativity-in-the-uk-for-granted-a3176216.html\">Sands wrote</a>: “The subject of foreign investors in London housing fires up audiences in the same way that derisory corporation tax for multinationals infuriates them. I have tried to argue that luxury housing does not affect the rest of us but the fact is that it makes London soulless . . . The flats are deposit boxes.”</p> <p>None of this chimes with Berkeley. About half the London-focused housebuilder's sales are to investors, the majority of which are based overseas. It has sales offices dotted across Asia and the Middle East, supported by a web of subsidiaries in Jersey, the Isle of Man, Singapore, Hong Kong and the Bahamas. For the six months to October, its average selling price was £799,000, or about 24 times London's median salary. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Sands brings some local knowledge to the role. In 2018, she revealed she was moving to a flat in White City, west London, that was <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/media/2018/01/sarah-sands-diary-having-continuing-faith-bbc-despite-pay-gap-anger\">bought off-plan</a>. The site, “recently carved from a building previously <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9e26b32-69a0-11e8-aee1-39f3459514fd\">devoted to light industry</a>”, had been populated by owner-occupiers “whose first language is English,” she wrote approvingly. </p> <p>A west London base means Sands will be familiar with Berkeley's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1363e4f0-dade-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17\">£8bn flagship White City regeneration scheme</a>, which covers nearly half a square mile east of what was formerly BBC Television Centre.</p> <h2>Deliveroo: political animal</h2> <p>Among the cliques involved in Deliveroo's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5028437e-accf-4624-8ecd-2b502d04743d\">bomb float</a>, one of the most common overlaps is with Hanbury Strategy. The well-connected PR firm works “at the intersection of business and politics”, according to its website, and is <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/how-the-political-elite-fattened-up-deliveroos-floperoo-float-krqpg9wkh\">said to have been instrumental</a> in securing public backing for the food delivery service from politicians including Chancellor Rishi Sunak.</p> <p>Hanbury set up shop three months after the 2016 EU referendum to advise on political risks. Co-founders are Ameet Gill, the pro-Remain former Number 10 director of strategy, and Paul Stephenson, the director of communications on Dominic Cummings' Vote Leave campaign. </p> <p>Deliveroo brought in Hanbury in 2017 on the recommendation of Thea Rogers, its corporate communications chief and the fiancée of former chancellor George Osborne. It was Hanbury that handled the communications when Osborne was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99ea2488-fe1d-407f-9dda-a537d7471d65\">named a partner at bank Robey Warshaw</a>.</p> <p>Hanbury also worked in the background on Comcast's bid in 2018 for broadcaster Sky, where Robey Warshaw <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/sky-ma-auction-robey-warshaw-idUSL8N1W80V8\">reportedly</a> put together the US cable group's winning $40bn offer. The PR firm is said to be in expansion mode having last month spun off a City-focused political division, <a href=\"https://www.prweek.com/article/1709740/hanbury-backs-launch-political-advisory-agency\">Forefront Advisers</a>, led by former EU civil servant Gergely Polner and ex-Labour party strategist James McBride.</p> <p>* <em>This article has been revised since its original publication</em></p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'The curious online popularity of M&amp;A adviser Zaoui' FT.com 9 April.
