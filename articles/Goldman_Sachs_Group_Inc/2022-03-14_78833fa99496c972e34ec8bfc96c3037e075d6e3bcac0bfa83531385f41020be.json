Another person familiar with the situation said the US was preparing to warn its allies, amid some indications that China may be preparing to help Russia.</p> <p>Zhao Lijian, China's foreign ministry spokesperson, dismissed the claims as “disinformation” from the US. </p> <p>The revelation comes as Jake Sullivan, US national security adviser, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8b3153f-02a9-473a-a52f-86fb59f5c838\">heads to Rome</a> for talks today with Yang Jiechi, China's top foreign policy official. The talks are the highest level US-China face-to-face meeting since Russia invaded Ukraine more than three weeks ago and come against a backdrop of rising frustration in the west over China's refusal to condemn the war.</p> <p>China's state-run media has supported Russian claims that the US was using Ukraine to research dangerous pathogens and biological weapons.

Shenzhen locks down 17mn residents</strong> The southern Chinese city of Shenzhen has imposed a lockdown as China tries to control the worst outbreak of Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic.
