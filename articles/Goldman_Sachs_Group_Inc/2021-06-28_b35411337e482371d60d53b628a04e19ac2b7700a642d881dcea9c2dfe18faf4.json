  "text": "<p><br>A former Goldman Sachs analyst and his brother who worked at law firm Clifford Chance have pleaded not guilty to six counts of insider trading and three allegations of fraud.</p> <p>Mohammed Zina, who worked as an analyst in the conflict resolution group at Goldman Sachs, and Suhail Zina, a former solicitor at Clifford Chance, appeared at London's Southwark Crown Court on Monday to deny the charges brought by the Financial Conduct Authority.</p> <p>The alleged insider trading took place between July 2016 and December 2017 and involved trading in companies including UK chipmaker Arm Holdings and pub group Punch Taverns.</p> <p>When the FCA announced in February that it had charged the men, both 33, it accused them of reaping a £142,000 profit from the trades.</p> <p>The UK regulator claimed the pair had access to confidential information that was available to members of the conflicts resolution group at Goldman Sachs, according to the list of charges read out in court.</p> <p>According to the Goldman Sachs website, the conflict resolutions group “evaluates advisory, financing, principal investing, lending and other activities to identify actual or perceived conflicts of interest”.</p> <p>The FCA accuses Mohammed Zina of being an insider through his employment at the US investment bank in the period covered by the charges, according to the list of charges.</p> <p>The brothers, from north-east London, also on Monday pleaded not guilty to three counts of fraud in which they are accused of making a misleading representation to Tesco Bank for loans. The regulator alleges that the purpose of the loans was to acquire shares, rather than for the home improvements the brothers had claimed.&#xa0;</p> <p>Mohammed Zina, dressed in a blue shirt, and Suhail Zina, wearing a blue suit with maroon tie, stood in the dock at Southwark Crown Court as they denied all charges. The duo will stand trial before a jury on April 4 next year and their next court appearance is scheduled for September 6.</p> <p>The brothers, who are on unconditional bail, left their roles at Goldman Sachs and Clifford Chance in 2018. Suhail Zina qualified as a solicitor in February 2017. Goldman Sachs has previously said the firm is not subject to any investigation linked to the proceedings.&#xa0;</p> <p>Fraud carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, while insider trading carries a potential sentence of up to seven years.&#xa0;</p> <p>The FCA, which is responsible for supervising about 60,000 firms, has made tackling market abuse and insider trading a top priority. It and its predecessor, the Financial Services Authority, have secured 36 convictions for insider trading since 2001. In its 2019-20 annual report, the regulator said it had opened 415 preliminary reviews into market abuse.</p><p>Source: Jane Croft 2021 'Ex-Goldman analyst and former Clifford Chance lawyer deny insider trading' FT.com 28 June.
