  "title": "Debt-Limit Suspension Passes House, Faces Standoff in Senate; Democrats' bill, which faces GOP opposition, would keep government funded until early December",
  "text": "<p>The Senate is expected to vote on the measure either later this week or early next, according to aides. The White House said in a statement Tuesday night it supported the bill.</p><p>Democratic leaders announced Monday they would combine the two measures, despite broad GOP resistance to increasing the debt limit, ensuring that the threat of a partial government shutdown next month would be linked with the possibility of the federal government not being able to pay its bills on time.</p><p>House leaders said Tuesday they were taking quick action to give the Senate time to figure out how to break the partisan logjam that has developed over raising the debt limit. Republicans have said they oppose voting to increase the debt ceiling in protest against the trillions in spending Democrats are trying to pass in Congress without GOP support.</p><p>\"We want to send it over to the Senate and give the Senate an opportunity to consider it and figure out what they're going to do,\" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) told reporters Tuesday.</p><p>Most Senate Republicans have said they won't vote to increase the debt limit, saying Democrats should shoulder responsibility on their own after passing $1.9 trillion in Covid-19 relief earlier this year without GOP votes. Democrats, who narrowly control the House and the Senate, are currently trying to squeeze through a roughly $3.5 trillion package of healthcare, education and climate-change provisions without GOP support.</p><p>\"They want massive new spending—it's all laid out in their budget and then they want us to raise the debt ceiling to fund that? No interest,\" said Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.). \"They can do this themselves.\"</p><p>Raising the debt limit doesn't authorize new spending, but rather allows the Treasury Department to issue new debt to cover spending that Congress already has authorized, including payments to bondholders, Social Security recipients and veterans.</p><p>Senate Republicans said Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) was urging them to band together to force Democrats to lift the debt limit on their own, a political liability for which neither party wants to take sole responsibility.</p><p>Republicans noted that Democrats could add an increase in the debt limit into the roughly $3.5 trillion package they are passing through a process tied to the budget, known as reconciliation, that allows them to advance legislation in the Senate with just a simple majority. Most bills require 60 votes to clear procedural hurdles in the Senate.</p><p>Democrats have said they don't want to increase the debt limit through that process, which would let Republicans off the hook and could be complicated and time consuming, and noted that they voted with Republicans to raise the debt ceiling under former President Donald Trump's administration.</p><p>\"To do otherwise—not doing the debt ceiling in a bipartisan way—has been considered unthinkable because the consequences for the economy, for the American people, for our standing on the world stage would be too severe,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said on the Senate floor Tuesday. \"Playing games with the debt ceiling is playing with fire and putting it on the back of the American people.\"</p><p>It is also not clear whether or when Democrats will succeed in coalescing enough support for the broader social-welfare and climate package, which has sparked concerns among centrists. Democratic leaders can afford no defections from among their own ranks in the Senate and only three votes in the House.</p><p>The legislation being voted on Tuesday, known as a continuing resolution, or CR, also includes $28.6 billion in emergency disaster aid, including for victims of Hurricane Ida and other recent storms. Lawmakers also agreed to include $6.3 billion to help resettle Afghan evacuees headed for or in the U.S. and provide assistance for Afghan refugees in other countries.</p><p>Democrats punted one brewing internal dispute over funding for Israel's Iron Dome rocket-defense system by pushing it to the defense spending bill after liberal Democrats raised concerns over including it in the spending measure.</p><p>It wasn't yet clear Tuesday what would happen if the spending measure and debt limit increase fails in the Senate, as lawmakers predicted it would.</p><p>\"There has to be a plan B and a plan C and a plan D. We got to get it done,\" said Sen. Ben Cardin (D., Md.), but he said he didn't yet know what they would be.</p><p>Republicans urged Democrats to strip out the contentious debt-limit increase from the rest of the bill, which is largely uncontroversial.</p><p>\"It seems to me what we should be doing is passing a clean CR that ensures that government is not shut down and includes the disaster assistance and aid for settling Afghan refugees because those are emergencies on which there is bipartisan support,\" said Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine), who declined to say how she would vote on a stand-alone measure lifting the debt limit.</p><p>Some Republicans had raised the possibility Monday night that they could simply not vote on the first procedural motion connected to increasing the debt limit, allowing Democrats to advance the measure and then approve it with their own votes on the final passage vote. But other GOP lawmakers quickly nixed that idea.</p><p>The standoff has alarmed Wall Street analysts and business leaders, who in recent weeks have issued warnings about a rising risk of a technical default, in which the government might be unable to make all of its regular paymentsin full and on time. The threat of such a default could derail markets and hit U.S. economic growth.</p><p>The heads of a key Treasury advisory panel said Tuesday they were deeply concerned about the market consequences. In a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the chairwoman and vice chairman of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee said that even if a default were avoided, \"continued negotiations over the debt limit could cause needless volatility, create additional operational expenses for market participants and do lasting damage to the Treasury market.\"</p><p>Beth Hammack, global treasurer at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. who is chairwoman of the Treasury committee, and Brian Sack, director of global economics at D.E. Shaw and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said a protracted debt limit fight could have cascading effects in the Treasury market and cause broader market stress.</p><p>\"To default would be unthinkable, but even to risk that outcome would be reckless and irresponsible,\" they said.</p><p>Kate Davidson contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com</p><p>Debt-Limit Suspension Passes House, Faces Standoff in Senate</p>",
