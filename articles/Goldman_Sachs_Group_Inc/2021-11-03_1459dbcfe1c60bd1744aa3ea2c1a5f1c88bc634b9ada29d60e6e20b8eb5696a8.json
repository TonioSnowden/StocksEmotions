  "title": "Financial System Makes Big Promises on Climate Change at COP26 Summit; The global finance industry, its regulators and investors pledge trillions in funding to reduce carbon emissions",
  "text": "<p>The United Nations' Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero says financial groups with assets of $130 trillion have committed to its program to cut emissions. That is enough scale to generate $100 trillion through 2050 to fund investments needed for new technologies, and enough reach to impose pathways for corporations and financial institutions to restructure themselves, the group said.</p><p>The funding, unveiled Wednesday by U.N. Climate Envoy Mark Carney during the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, can take the form of bank loans and investments by venture capitalists, private-equity firms, mutual funds, endowments and other big investors that buy stocks and bonds. These would all be used to shift funds toward investments that help lower carbon emissions, while still earning a profit.</p><p>Financial regulators, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, plus the global accounting-standards organization have agreed to add their own oversight to the system through reviews and disclosure standards.</p><p>\"These seemingly arcane but essential changes to the plumbing of finance can move and are moving climate changes from the fringes to the forefront and transforming the financial system in the process,\" said Mr. Carney, a former head of the central banks of England and Canada, who led the initiative.</p><p>\"The gap between what governments have and what the world needs is large,\" in order to finance a global energy transition, said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, speaking in Glasgow after the announcement of the finance measures. \"And the private sector needs to play a bigger role.\"</p><p>Ms. Yellen said the U.S. will join the U.K. in supporting a climate focused capital-markets mechanism that \"will help attract significant new private climate finance,\" providing $500 million a year for clean technology programming that includes accelerating the transition away from coal.</p><p>The Carney-led alliance, whose acronym is GFANZ, also elevated billionaire and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg to co-chair the group with Mr. Carney.</p><p>The alliance will help to scale up and accelerate what the private sector could contribute towards reducing emissions, said Jane Fraser, chief executive of Citigroup Inc., who spoke at the Glasgow announcement. She said the bank was working with clients to come up with measures to target the aviation and steel sector first.</p><p>\"Now, the key is to find the projects and where to deploy all that capital,\" said Larry Fink, chief executive of Blackrock, who also spoke at the event.</p><p>Diplomats in Glasgow are wrangling over commitments by the world's governments to cut carbon emissions. That is putting the private sector ahead in addressing climate change. While the agreements unveiled this week are largely voluntary, they are more specific and transformative, and include financial commitments that governments are reluctant to provide.</p><p>The promises represent a sharp turn in thinking at most global financial institutions. Six years ago, when world leaders gathered in Paris for a predecessor to Glasgow, financial institutions and banks weren't a serious part of the conversation. The idea of an asset manager or a bank pledging to meet the Paris agreements wouldn't come for several years, and wouldn't become widespread until the last two.</p><p>At the start of 2020, the sum total of financial capital committed to hitting net-zero emissions was $5 trillion, compared with the $130 trillion this week.</p><p>To deliver, financial executives admit they will need more global government cohesion on regulations.</p><p>\"It's going to be hard to achieve those commitments without governments in a meaningful way,\" said Joseph Amato, the president and chief investment officer at $430 billion investment manager Neuberger Berman, which is part of the Net-Zero group. \"There's going to be a lot of local politics that are going to affect the pace.\"</p><p>The private-sector plans are far from concrete. Those that signed up don't all subscribe to the same urgency on time frames; they focus on different industries as helpful and harmful; and they don't plan to follow the same paths. Few banks or investors even have a true understanding of their current environmental impact, as the data from companies they back is inconsistent or nonexistent.</p><p>That has led to questions about whether their pledges are real or will carry the weight the financial companies say they do. Critics have questioned banks for refusing to cut off oil-and-gas producers faster, and focusing on net-reductions that allow for continued support for larger emitters.</p><p>Those in the Glasgow group—which includes banks, insurers, investors, stock exchanges, ratings firms and index providers—are pledging to set \"science-based\" targets to sharply lower emissions by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050. They have said they would report each year on their progress.</p><p>The U.N. group itself has limited power to enforce its rules, but regulators are moving in the same direction. A new international body is being created by the group that sets international accounting standards to develop standardized rules on how companies should disclose climate information.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is planning to announce rules over carbon disclosure in the near future in line with plans in place in the U.K. and the European Union. Central banks from dozens of countries, including the Fed, have said they are working on climate-related examinations of financial institutions to further pressure the industry into thinking about its risks.</p><p>On Tuesday, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said the U.K. would set requirements for companies to publish net-zero transition plans, setting out how they will decarbonize through 2050.</p><p>Besides getting pressure from regulators, banks are feeling the heat from their investors, which have pushed more aggressively to address climate change.</p><p>The work isn't entirely altruistic; massive amounts of money will be made by those who get the answers right. For investors, it is about finding and backing the next Tesla Inc. For banks, it is about becoming the smartest lenders and advisers in the midst of an industrial revolution. Those who bet wrong, or stick with technologies that are shunned, could face steep losses.</p><p>Mr. Carney, the former central bank official, had early momentum getting financial companies to sign up for his Glasgow plan. But it took months of cajoling to get holdouts such as JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to join.</p><p>Some of the holdouts became convinced that regulations on carbon emissions were on their way and they would have to address climate change soon anyway.</p><p>Critics say that by joining the group, banks can get undeserved credit for going green before they have done anything. They argue that banks such as JPMorgan that are big lenders to fossil-fuel companies should be forced to take action before they sign up. JPMorgan has said it has made progress on its commitments and aims to finance $2.5 trillion in such work.</p><p>Mr. Carney also faced criticism for his other job as vice chairman of Brookfield Asset Management Inc., a Canadian investment firm. Brookfield is a member of the alliance but is also a longtime investor in fossil-fuel infrastructure. On Tuesday before the Glasgow finance announcement, a fund run by Brookfield closed on the $13 billion purchase of Inter Pipeline Ltd., a Canadian petroleum and natural-gas transportation and processing company.</p><p>\"The transition to net zero is about transitioning higher carbon emitting businesses to more sustainable operations, not simply the divestment of assets that currently have higher emissions,\" a Brookfield spokesman said.</p><p>Simon Clark and Sha Hua in Glasgow contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to David Benoit at david.benoit@wsj.com</p><p>Financial System Makes Big Promises on Climate Change at COP26 Summit</p>",
