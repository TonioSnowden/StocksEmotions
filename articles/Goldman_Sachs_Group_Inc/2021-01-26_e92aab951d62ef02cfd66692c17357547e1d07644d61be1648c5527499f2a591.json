The announcement came as Apollo revealed the conclusion of a review by the law firm <strong>Dechert</strong> into Black's relationship with the late paedophile <strong>Jeffrey Epstein</strong>.

But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a790c796-f0c4-4cf9-8c7a-3b52daff89e4\">what's happening on Wall Street</a> is central to the dynamics driving corporate finance activity.&#xa0;</p> <p>Stocks around the world have soared from the pandemic-induced lows hit in March in a rally fuelled by an onslaught of central bank and government stimulus.&#xa0;</p> <p>The rapid rise in equity prices combined with a frenzy of trading among newly-minted amateur investors (exhibit A: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f8937ac7-da4a-41a6-bbbf-7b573e8ed72b\">what's happening with</a> <strong>GameStop </strong>and<strong> BlackBerry</strong>) are contributing to mounting angst among some investors that a bubble is brewing.&#xa0;</p> <p>One measure of exuberance in the US market — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/856c7e84-dd8b-4b6b-8e39-21826ebc15b6\">the ludicrous index</a> — is already charging towards dotcom era heights reached more than two decades ago.</p> <p>In fact, one of the most frequent questions asked by clients of <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> is whether US stocks are in the throes of a “bubble”, <strong>David Kostin</strong>, the Wall Street bank's top US equity strategist, said at the end of last week.&#xa0;</p> <p>Companies have taken advantage of red-hot markets to launch a <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/45770ddb-29e0-41c2-a97a-60ce13810ff2?\">$400bn fundraising blitz</a> in the first three weeks of 2021, about $170bn above the average for this time of year, according to an FT analysis of <strong>Refinitiv </strong>data.</p> <p>Breaking that figure down further, companies raised $337bn in the bond market, with unprecedented stimulus measures by central banks pushing down borrowing costs even for the riskiest companies.&#xa0;</p> <p>The rest of that $400bn in fundraising comes from a record $64bn through IPOs and secondary offerings, which, you guessed it, includes Wall Street billionaires' favourite pastime: the special purpose acquisition company.</p> <h2>And speaking of Spacs . . . </h2> <p>If you ask <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a109af64-605a-11e9-9300-0becfc937c37\">famed investor</a> <strong>Jeremy Grantham</strong>, the US craze for Spacs is “reprehensible”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Not that he's complaining. Grantham “by accident” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/faedd2a1-2008-4f1e-9198-7694fba791b0\">made $200m</a> from a personal investment in the battery maker <strong>QuantumScape </strong>after it merged with a Spac last year<strong>.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>The company, like plenty of other stocks that have listed via Spac deals, has caught the attention of retail investors who have taken to day trading like pros. Except they're not, of course.&#xa0;</p> <p>In addition to the stocks' aforementioned effervescent rise and frenzied retail investors, Grantham blames the blank-cheque boom captivating big-name investors and their wallets as of late for the “extreme overvaluation”.</p> <p>In the same camp stands <strong>Muddy Waters</strong>, the US short seller run by <strong>Carson Block</strong>, which called the instruments “the great 2020 money grab” in a scathing attack, and <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> boss <strong>David Solomon</strong>, who called the craze <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/caa33f44-fd08-4049-a20e-3c3fde778b50\">unsustainable</a>.</p> <p>But despite these warnings, Spacs' surging popularity has sauntered unabashedly into the new year.&#xa0;</p> <p>If this week's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/edfc90fc-13df-4b5c-92ef-677407ad936c\">merger Monday</a> is any indication, DD is in for a very busy 2021. Spacs struck five mergers totalling more than $15bn, led by a $7.3bn deal between <strong>Alight</strong>, a cloud HR-benefits provider controlled by <strong>Blackstone</strong>, with a vehicle launched by the US billionaire<strong> Bill Foley</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Here's a snapshot of the Spac scene so far this year:</p> <ul>  <li><p>There are plenty more Spacs to go around. 129 Spacs searching for private companies to target;</p></li>  <li><p>Spacs are launching at a rapid pace with 66 vehicles raising $18.3bn so far this year, outpacing the $13.2bn raised through traditional initial public offerings globally;</p></li>  <li><p>With almost a quarter of last year's $79bn raised in the first three weeks of 2021 alone, we could be in for another record-breaking year.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <p>Read the FT's full Runaway Markets series <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/38ee2e14-8b0a-48aa-9525-520992c08375\">here</a> for more on all the Spac and equity markets mania.</p> <h2>Debenhams: happily ever after administration</h2> <p>Cast your mind back to 2006, when <strong>Tony Blair</strong> was Britain's prime minister and the financial crisis was still over a year away.</p> <p>UK department store group<strong> Debenhams</strong> returned to the stock market with a £1.7bn market value, and <strong>Arcadia</strong> chief executive <strong>Philip Green</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd2e9b8a-c9b6-4a2f-8810-cb749ea37421\"><strong>was knighted</strong></a> for his services to retail.</p> <p>Few noticed <strong>Asos</strong>, a small online fashion retailer trading at four times its £19m of annual sales, or <strong>Mahmud Kamani</strong>, the Manchester-based rag trade entrepreneur and his curiously named <strong>Wasabi Frog </strong>ecommerce start-up.</p> <p>But a princess must have kissed it — because the Frog, now called<strong> Boohoo</strong>, is worth £4.4bn and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c81e7266-984f-4c38-8543-83e6449eb79a\">just bought</a> what's left of Debenhams out of administration for £55m. (Not all of the online retailer's rise <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a450acb0-7c8b-4b98-b77e-a1df4d52574b\">has been a fairytale</a>, it's worth noting).</p> <p>Asos, which Sir Philip liked to denigrate as a passing fad, has annual sales of £3bn and is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2dc802e-30e0-43b0-97d8-5267ccf30722\">poised to buy</a> the best bits of Arcadia out of administration. Neither it nor Boohoo wants to run stores, so hundreds of them will close and thousands of jobs will go.</p> <p>Conclusions? The obvious one is that ecommerce offers a storybook ending, while brick-and-mortar is a recipe for tragedy. But discount operations <strong>Primark</strong>, <strong>Aldi</strong>, <strong>B&amp;M</strong> and others impinge on that generalisation. Properly run stores can still make money.</p> <p>Look instead at investment. Asos and Boohoo have poured money into marketing, logistics and IT. Asos's selling and general admin spend is routinely half of sales. Boohoo gives 10 per cent of turnover to its marketing department. Neither has ever paid a dividend.</p> <p>Debenhams was owned by private equity, Arcadia by a tycoon. Neither invested a great deal. Both milked their companies like they were cows, with financial engineering facilitating huge dividends. Now the milk's gone sour.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Colin Fan</strong>, a former senior executive at<strong> Deutsche Bank</strong>, is stepping down from his role as managing partner at <strong>SoftBank</strong>'s Vision Fund, marking the latest shake-up at the fund's tumultuous US operations. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/591b5c94-9837-4e58-9a0f-977e2a67b54f\">Go deeper</a>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>N26 GmbH</strong>, the German mobile bank backed by billionaires <strong>Peter Thiel</strong> and <strong>Li Ka-shing</strong>, named former <strong>Zalando</strong> finance chief <strong>Jan Kemper</strong> as its CFO. He succeeds the company's co-founder, <strong>Maximilian Tayenthal</strong>, who will be co-chief executive alongside <strong>Valentin Stalf</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>Law firm <strong>Paul Weiss </strong>has poached <strong>Sullivan &amp; Cromwell </strong>lawyer<strong> Krishna Veeraraghavan </strong>who joins as an M&amp;A partner in New York. In San Francisco, it also hired<strong> Orrick</strong> alums <strong>Melinda Haag</strong>, <strong>Walter Brown</strong> and <strong>Randy Luskey </strong>as partners in its litigation department, and <strong>Jeremy Veit</strong> as a partner in its corporate department from <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Linklaters</strong> has appointed <strong>Matt Keats</strong> as head of energy and infrastructure for the Middle East. He succeeds <strong>Sarosh Mewawalla</strong>, who has retired from the partnership. Keats formerly led the firm's energy and infrastructure practice in Moscow.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Latham &amp; Watkins</strong> added<strong> Gianluca Bacchiocchi </strong>and <strong>Guido Liniado</strong> as partners in its New York office, where they will advise on energy and infrastructure deals in Latin America.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Private equity group <strong>Eurazeo</strong> brought on a three-person team from <strong>Marguerite</strong> — <strong>Laurent Chatelin</strong>, <strong>Martin Sichelkow</strong>, and <strong>Melissa Cohen</strong> — to comprise its new infrastructure investments team.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Brunswick Group</strong> has hired<strong> Brian Potskowski </strong>as a partner focusing on climate issues in its London office. He was previously vice-president for the energy-focused investment group <strong>Riverstone Holdings</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>Orrick has hired <strong>David Schulman</strong> as a life sciences partner in its Washington office. He joins from<strong> Dechert</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Reed Smith</strong> has hired<strong> Dimitris Assimakis</strong> as a partner in its global corporate group in Athens. He joins from <strong>Norton Rose Fulbright</strong> where he was a partner and head of the Greek energy practice. &#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Bankruptcy bureaucracy </strong>The best way to file for insolvency in the US? Don't. Take Hertz and AMC for example: both companies were squashed by stay-at-home-orders, but only one was able to sell its stock to stay afloat. The difference is in the paperwork.
