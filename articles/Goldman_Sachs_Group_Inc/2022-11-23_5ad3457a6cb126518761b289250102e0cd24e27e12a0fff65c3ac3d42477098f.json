  "text": "<p>In the last few days you have reported on WeWork's ongoing massive losses and now the spectacular crash of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX. </p> <p>In her Long View (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88b5ee20-ad24-4438-bf20-2ce2106eb9c0\">November 12</a>) Katie Martin said such businesses are based around “hand-wavey ambitions rather than on traditional boring stuff like revenues, dividends . . . and institutional resilience”. Spot on. </p> <p>But it seems also that in each case these businesses are built off the towering and hubristic egos of a relatively untested and youthful man. </p> <p>Adam Neumann's ambition for his shared-office business was no less than to “elevate the world's consciousness” and Bankman-Fried saw no reason last year why FTX shouldn't acquire Goldman Sachs. It would all be comical, if it wasn't the case that many inexperienced investors suffer in such implosions. </p> <p>These “emperor's new clothes” business models had something else in common. Masayoshi Son of SoftBank stood cheering them on, helping to pump up company values to $47bn (WeWork) and $32bn (FTX). Perhaps Masa's money, combined with a narcissistic young founder should be a sure-fire sign to sell and get out fast!</p> <p><strong>Charlie Metcalfe</strong> <br><em>Lisbon, Portugal</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Here's what else FTX and WeWork have in common' FT.com 23 November.
