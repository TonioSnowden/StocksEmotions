  "text": "<p>Bregal—which has ties to Europe's Brenninkmeijer family—began marketing the latest fund in March, the people said. Despite a crowded fundraising market, Bregal attracted seven new investors to the fund as well as 13 who committed to the predecessor vehicle, the people said.</p><p>As it drives toward a final close on its fourth growth fund, the firm is also preparing to begin raising commitments for its third credit opportunities vehicle with a $500 million goal, according to the people. Bregal wrapped up a predecessor, Bregal Sagemount Credit Opportunities Fund II LP, with more than $260 million in 2019, the people said.</p><p>The firm invests in North American companies with recurring revenue streams. It focuses on five industries: software; digital infrastructure; healthcare information technology and services; business and consumer services; and financial technology and specialty finance.</p><p>Bregal typically partners with company founders and initially commits $40 million to $400 million in equity to companies with annual revenue of more than $15 million, according to its website. The firm writes checks of $15 million to $100 million for credit transactions involving senior or subordinated debt, the website said.</p><p>Investments by the firm that have closed this year include backing for Greenwich, Conn.-based payments technology firm PayArc LLC and Irvine, Calif.-based DentalXChange, which provides electronic patient data to service providers and insurers. Bregal kept busy last year, announcing backing for at least 10 companies and the sale of stakes in six, according to its website.</p><p>Managing Partner Gene Yoon co-founded Bregal Sagemount in 2012 with capital from the Brenninkmeijer family's other investment businesses. Mr. Yoon previously led the private-equity practice of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Americas special situations group, focusing on growth investments in midsize companies, according to Bregal's website.</p><p>Write to Preeti Singh at preeti.singh@wsj.com</p>",
