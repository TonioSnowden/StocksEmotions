  "text": "<p><strong>JD Wetherspoon</strong> blamed a record half-year loss on the “economic and social mayhem” and colossal debts caused by government's Covid-19 restrictions, “with no apparent health benefits”.</p> <p>The pub chain posted a £46.2m loss for the six months to the end of January, compared with a pre-tax profit of £57.9m in the same period the previous year. Revenues more than halved to £431m while like-for-like sales were down 53 per cent.</p> <p>“It is disappointing that so many regulations, implemented at tremendous cost to the nation, appear to have had no real basis in common sense or science, said Tim Martin, Wetherspoon's outspoken chair. “The future of the industry, and of the UK economy, depends on a consistent set of sensible policies, and the ending of lockdowns and tier systems, which have created economic and social mayhem and colossal debts, with no apparent health benefits.”</p> <p>Wetherspoon said that 3.3 per cent of its staff had caught the virus in the months between July and Christmas, 1 percentage point less than the rate for the UK as a whole. The pub group also argued that despite 50m visits to its pubs no outbreak of coronavirus had been linked to one of its sites.</p> <p>The company expects to open around half of its venues with outside space in April. It reported £225m of liquidity as of January 24, including £94m raised from an equity issue, versus a £4m per week cash burn while pubs are closed.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>Investec</strong> said operating results for the financial year ending March will be in line with the guidance given with interim results in November. Fani Titi, chief executive, said the bank was “encouraged by the momentum we are seeing across our business, the continued recovery of markets and the positive developments related to Covid-19 vaccines.”</p> <p>Dye &amp; Durhan has walked away from talks to buy <strong>Idox</strong>, the £240m-valued software and information management company. In February, Vancouver-based Dye &amp; Durham said it was in talks over a possible cash offer for Idox, having submitted offers of 67p, 70p and 75p per share. Idox, whose stock closed on Thursday at 55p, said it had “engaged constructively” with Dye &amp; Durham and was confident of its future as an independent company. </p> <p><strong>Halfords</strong> has agreed to buy Universal Tyre and Autocentres, a motoring services provider based in Kent, for £15m.</p> <p><strong>ContourGlobal</strong> pledged to keep growing its dividend by 10 per cent after delivering annual results that matched forecasts. For 2021 the owner of power generation plants across Europe, Africa and Latin America targeted adjusted ebitda of between $770m and $800m. Its 2020 results showed a $29m net profit, up 26 per cent year on year, with adjusted ebitda up 3 per cent to $772m.</p> <p>Investment platform <strong>AJ Bell</strong> announced the acquisition of Adalpha, which is developing a mobile focused platform proposition for financial advisers. No terms were provided. &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Barclays</strong> said it will on Friday begin the share buyback programme announced in February, with a £700m budget for repurchases.</p> <p><strong>Futura Medical</strong> said European regulators have recommended that its Med3000 topical gel to treat male erectile dysfunction can be classed as a medical device. </p> <p><strong>Johnson Service</strong>, the workwear and hotel linen rental business, posted a £32.3m pre-tax loss for 2020 as hospitality industry closures meant revenue fell 34 per cent to £229.8m.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p>A group of first-year investment banking analysts at <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d853d6b4-1546-4435-9b7e-99e3e9475d50\">presented management</a> with <a href=\"https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rim9z3X.NpYk/v0?fbclid=IwAR0ODL_MKntKLsziT2uEzhkC0pW6GuIUG_C-0PPz3pnA7iIqTPaMn0l8fnE\">a slide deck</a> describing arduous working conditions last month, shining a rare spotlight on the stresses faced by young people working in investment banking. Based on a survey of 13 analysts, the slide deck reported an average work week of 95 hours, with five hours of sleep a night starting at 3am. “I can't sleep any more because my anxiety levels are through the roof,” said one of the analysts.</p> <p><strong>Google</strong> announced that it plans <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93248edf-8fcf-425d-9d1a-2d41fed2c7f4\">to spend $7bn this year</a> on expanding its network of US offices and data centres, saying it still saw value in employees “coming together in person to collaborate”. The additions to Google's physical presence came as part of the search and advertising group's plan to create at least 10,000 full-time jobs in addition to its current US workforce of 84,000.</p> <p><strong>Chubb</strong>, the largest US non-life insurer by market capitalisation, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a4841ac6-5efc-448c-a8c1-dcf567dcb8ab\">has approached</a> rival <strong>Hartford Financial Services Group</strong> with an unsolicited $23.2bn takeover offer, in what could be the first mega-deal in an industry battered by losses stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. Chubb is led by&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5a2e4e3c-7755-11e7-90c0-90a9d1bc9691\">Evan Greenberg</a>, son Maurice “Hank” Greenberg, who turned AIG into a financial powerhouse over four decades. Insurers have paid out billions of dollars in claims on a variety of policies, ranging from business interruption to event cancellation. According to some estimates, total claims from the&#xa0;pandemic&#xa0;across the global insurance industry will top $100bn.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>FT editorial board</strong> <br>Though belated, the government's&#xa0;white paper&#xa0;on auditing and corporate governance <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b70bf3c-608c-463a-8907-c0c7c19bf6b6\">sets out a sensible framework</a> in response to the high-profile failures in recent years. </p> <p><strong>Merryn Somerset Webb <br></strong>The Deliveroo IPO, one of the biggest in the UK for a long time, should help retail investors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76d7c370-8e02-4d05-b2d2-48d3b2d18223\">develop a taste for shareholder democracy</a>.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
