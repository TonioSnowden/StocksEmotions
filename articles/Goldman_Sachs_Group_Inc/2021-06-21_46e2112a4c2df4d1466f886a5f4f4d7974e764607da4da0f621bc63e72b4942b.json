  "text": "<p>The pandemic has minted a record number of billionaires — nowhere more so than in Asia. For HSBC, that rise validates a bet on regional wealth management.</p> <p>The Asia-focused bank is aggressively expanding in the region, adding more than 5,000 staff and investing $3.5bn in wealth management operations. Over the medium to long term, it hopes to grow wealth revenues at a compound annual growth rate of more than 10 per cent. </p> <p>Demand is there. Asia-Pacific accounted for 38 per cent of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/747a76dd-f018-4d0d-a9f3-4069bf2f5a93\">world's billionaires</a> as of July last year, according to a UBS report. Of those, half are in mainland China. </p> <p>But in a country where relationships matter, foreign banks have a significant disadvantage. Local lenders such as China Merchants Bank and the Bank of China dominate the wealth management market, valued at an estimated $17tn.</p> <p>Overseas rivals have poured in money to compete. UBS and Credit Suisse, which earn about a tenth of group revenues from wealth management in Asia, have invested heavily to build up their client base. Goldman Sachs has partnered with Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China, China's biggest lender, for a wealth management <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/263c5b4a-8c29-485a-8b25-20f74c04ae7d\">joint venture</a>. </p> <p>Still, HSBC has an edge. It benefits from its dominant position in Hong Kong, which wealthy Chinese picked as a preferred location to park funds. Before political unrest, more than half of the $1tn private wealth in Hong Kong is estimated to have come from the mainland. </p> <p>Existing relationships coupled with lower interest rates have increased demand for HSBC's investment products. This gives the bank a head start. Its profits from Asian wealth and private banking reached $5.1bn last year, the highest among foreign peers. A financial <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d87df1f-1e85-45d5-a4b5-ba3d0a47b420\">connection</a> scheme between the mainland and Hong Kong would help too. </p> <p>Its shares trade at a less than 0.7 price-to-book value, a discount to global peers such as UBS. Heavy investment will mean a short-term hit to profits as HSBC builds up its wealth management market share. But the rapidly growing pool of Asian billionaires should accelerate the pace of returns.</p><p>Source:  2021 'HSBC: billionaire boom supports Asian wealth management drive  ' FT.com 21 June.
