  "title": "Chinese Investment Bank CICC Plans Large Capital Raise to Bolster Business; Bank shares fell after it said it wants to raise as much as $3.9 billion amid competition from foreign rivals",
  "text": "<p>CICC said in a regulatory filing that China's leading securities companies need to accelerate the pace of internationalization and actively participate in the global market.</p><p>China has increasingly allowed major global investment banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. toexpand in its domestic securities market. The country's homegrown financial institutions, at the same time, are trying to defend their home turf while increasing their international footprint.</p><p>CICC's Hong Kong-listed shares fell 8% Wednesday to close at their lowest level in more than two years after the company made its cash call. The company's Shanghai-listed shares dropped 9.2%.</p><p>Existing CICC shareholders would be offered the right to buy three shares for every 10 shares they own. The transaction needs shareholder approval, and could be wrapped up by November, the company said.</p><p>CICC is likely pursuing a rights offering to boost its capital position after its capital leverage ratio fell sharply to 11.7% at the end of June from 14.4% in the company's 2020 fiscal year, Citigroup analysts said in a research report. \"We believe the capital pressure could constrain the company's business expansion, prompting it to replenish capital,\" they said, adding that the additional funds will also help CICC capture rising demand from clients in businesses such as derivatives and swaps.</p><p>CICC is one of China's most storied investment banks. It was started in 1995 as a joint venture between Morgan Stanley and state-owned China Construction Bank. Early on, it worked on some landmark deals as China opened up to the world, including the Hong Kong initial public offerings of large state-owned companies, such as China Telecom's 1997 listing.</p><p>Morgan Stanley sold out of CICC in 2010. The Chinese investment bank now counts internet giants Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. among its shareholders, and is an active underwriter of many domestic and international listings of Chinese companies. It also provides a full suite of services that include sales and trading, investment research, debt financing, derivatives and wealth management.</p><p>CICC reported the equivalent of about $556 million in net profit in the first half of 2022, down 23% from the same period last year.</p><p>One bright spot was the bank's underwriting and sponsoring fees from equity financing, which rose 8.6% for the period to the equivalent of $245 million. IPOs in mainland China have jumped this year while new listings elsewhere have largely dried up. CICC closed 14 IPOs in mainland China as the lead underwriter in the first half.</p><p>The firm said China's securities industry could see falling profits, in part because the sharp selloff in Chinese stocksthis year has deterred investors from trading. It said one of its goals is to help support the country's economy by helping to finance industrial businesses and smaller companies.</p><p>Write to Rebecca Feng at rebecca.feng@wsj.com and Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com</p><p>Chinese Investment Bank CICC Plans Large Capital Raise to Bolster Business</p>",
