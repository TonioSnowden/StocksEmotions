  "title": "Stocks Turn Lower, Losing Early Momentum; Data from the Conference Board showed consumers' optimism cooled in June",
  "text": "<p>The major indexes in recent sessions have been highly sensitive to news and data as investors assess the durability of markets' bounce from lows. The S&amp;P 500 is attempting to claw back after falling into a bear market, or a 20% drop from a recent peak, earlier this month.</p><p>Stocks lost their early momentum after data from the Conference Board showed consumers' optimism cooled in June for the second consecutive month as Americans continue to assess the impact of high inflation and rising interest rates.</p><p>Meanwhile, other data released Tuesday morning showed home-price growth cooled slightly in April. The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index, which measures average home prices in major metropolitan areas across the country, rose at a slightly slower annualized pace in April compared with March.</p><p>\"The question is when we hit a market bottom and when we get that turning point, and it's not necessarily straight away,\" said Eloise Goulder, head of the global market, data and positioning intelligence teams in equity trading at JPMorgan Chase.</p><p>\"For me to get bullish on [the second half of the year], we need to see the combination of inflation having peaked, and data having stabilized,\" she added.</p><p>Stocks have largely rebounded in recent sessions as traders reassessed expectations of steep Federal Reserve interest-rate increases as some weakening economic data provided hope U.S. central bankers might become less hawkish as it tries to fight inflation.</p><p>Money managers and strategists said recent gains in equities have also been driven by month-end and quarter-end portfoliorebalancing, as well as some traders' willingness to buy the dip after a monthslong drawdown that has sent the S&amp;P 500 falling 18% this year.</p><p>On Tuesday, consumer discretionary stocks led the S&amp;P 500 lower following the consumer confidence reading. Nike was the biggest laggard on the index, falling 4.5% after the sneaker maker reported quarterly sales that were roughly flat and a decline in earnings.</p><p>Also Tuesday, China's National Health Commission said it would loosen its strict quarantine requirements for international travelers, in an attempt to balance its zero-Covid policy against pressures it is facing on its economy, which is the world's second-largest. U.S. stock futures reversed earlier losses to trade higher after the news and the three major averages opened higher.</p><p>Travel and energy companies were bright spots in the market after the loosening of China's Covid quarantine. Wynn Resorts gained 8.3% and Las Vegas Sands rose 8%. Diamondback Energy jumped 4.7% and Devon Energy added 3.7%.</p><p>Shares of Occidental Petroleum advanced 5.4% as a filing showed Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway added to its holdings in the energy company, lifting its stake to 16%.</p><p>Financials also outperformed the broader market as many of the largest U.S. banksboosted payouts to shareholders after passing the Fed's stress test. Goldman Sachs, which unveiled the largest dividend increase, added 1.1%. Wells Fargo jumped 2%. Shares of Jefferies Financial Group rose 3.7% after the company reported a steep drop in profit in the second quarter as it faced a challenging capital markets environment.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note advanced to 3.217%, from 3.193% Monday. Yields climb when bond prices fall. In general, Treasury yields have fallen in recent weeks as investors re-evaluated their expectations for the Fed's interest-rate hikes.</p><p>Oil prices edged higher. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose 0.8% to $110.48 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.5%, driven higher by a rally in stocks including energy and manufacturing companies.</p><p>In Asia, indexes broadly jumped after China said it would loosen its strict quarantine requirements. The CSI 300 index of Shanghai- and Shenzhen-listed stocks closed 1% higher, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 0.9%. Shares of airlines, restaurant chains and Macau casino operators surged.</p><p>â€”Quentin Webb contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Caitlin McCabe at caitlin.mccabe@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Turn Lower, Losing Early Momentum</p>",
