  "text": "<p>Vantage Towers has signalled its ambition in Europe as Vodafone's multi-billion pound phone masts business prepares to float, saying there are 170,000 towers potentially up for grabs in the coming years as the market consolidates. </p> <p>Vodafone carved out the assets into Vantage, a separate tower company, which the group said on Wednesday it expected to have listed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/16c2006f-7842-4bdd-a530-0f6c0c7dda16\">in Germany</a> by the end of March. </p> <p>The British company will maintain a majority stake in the tower business, which has 82,000 masts in 10 European markets, but the amount of shares being sold will be “meaningful” to ensure liquidity, said Vivek Badrinath, chief executive of Vantage. The float is expected to value the tower company at about €20bn, including debt, although the shares have yet to be priced. </p> <p>The decision to float Vantage will help reduce Vodafone's €44bn of net debt while creating a sector specialist capable of competing with specialist tower companies including<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a48d7767-32e5-4e49-a7fe-c4a3b5fd310a\"> Cellnex</a> and American Tower. </p> <p>Cellnex, which paid €5bn for French mast company Hivory this month and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f301a7b-6535-4695-85c9-a54391a82a33\">€10bn for CK Hutchison's towers</a> in November, has acquired 120,000 towers across Europe funded by regular rights issues and debt increases. American Tower, the largest global player, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1cb05815-582f-425f-b87c-1cfd9fff4db9\">acquired Spain's Telxius for €7.7bn</a> in January in the Boston-based group's biggest foray into Europe. </p> <p>Vantage has struck one small deal in Greece since it began to be carved out from Vodafone but expects becoming a listed company in its own right will help it become a more active player, as it will be able to issue shares. The company will initially have cash of about €1bn to target deals. </p> <p>Badrinath told the Financial Times that tower assets were “a bit of a sleeping beauty” in terms of value creation. </p> <p>Masts have historically been managed by local teams as part of technology departments but the boom in the value of telecoms infrastructure has given the asset a much greater status. </p> <p>Vodafone is not alone in splitting its core service business from its infrastructure. Deutsche Telekom has created an independent tower company within its structure while Orange, which has expressed a potential interest in joining forces with Vantage, completed its tower carve-out under the name Totem this month. </p> <p>Sharing infrastructure allows European telecoms groups to extract cost savings and benefit from consolidation in the market, in comparison to their retail operations where deals are often blocked by regulators. </p> <p>Vantage Towers, which employs 420 people, expects to attract infrastructure investors seeking a combination of predictable returns — with 60 per cent of its cash flow to be paid out in dividends — and mid-single digit growth rates, driven by new towers being built and increased “tenancies” as more telecoms companies aim to share their masts. </p> <p>Vantage argues that its “grid” can be better exploited as an independent company than as part of Vodafone as its former parent's rivals will be more comfortable using its towers for their own equipment. Badrinath said: “I sell a map. I can ask where are your coverage problems.” </p> <p>Vodafone named Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and UBS as joint co-ordinators for the float, with Berenberg, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Jefferies acting as bookrunners.</p><p>Source: Nic Fildes 2021 'Vantage hopes to take advantage of tower dealmaking boom ' FT.com 24 February.
