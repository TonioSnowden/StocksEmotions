  "text": "<p>Dear readers,</p> <p>An enterprising travel company once branded the third Monday in January the most depressing day of the year, as holiday cheer evaporated and bills flooded in.&#xa0;</p> <p>Though “Blue Monday” was never more than a gimmick, it was gratifying to kick off the week by siding with the optimists over the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7cdce392-306c-42a0-b7b6-e5bc51236a93\">inflation outlook</a> in the US. Pessimists fear soaring inflation as a result of stimulus efforts. But central banks have pumped liquidity into bond markets for more than a decade with little effect. US bond yields, adjusted for expected inflation, reveal little anxiety.</p> <p>Talk of a post-pandemic boom has prompted a look at records of the Roaring Twenties, a time of hedonism and prosperity in the US.&#xa0;After an early rise, inflation was low in the Jazz Age. Note though that the decade's&#xa0;low-inflation boom ignited a bull market that ended in the Wall Street crash. Given that technological advances are already heavily factored into stocks, equity investors may have more to fear than bondholders.</p> <p>The stock market boom created a bonanza for Wall Street traders and investment bankers last year. The benefits were not equally shared, as demonstrated by fourth-quarter earnings from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6fd7753-fb01-4544-9b07-133985eac1d5\">Goldman Sachs and Bank of America</a>. There is a gulf between standalone investment banks and those with heavy exposure to consumer lending. Expect that to go on widening in 2021.&#xa0;</p> <p>US asset managers BlackRock and Vanguard are two other <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/983542f1-151d-4fae-947a-6509967183aa\">clear winners from rising equity values</a>. They dominate the $8tn exchange traded funds industry.&#xa0;The amount ploughed by investors into ETFs last year was up by a third from 2019. The growing concentration of power raises some challenging issues, but do not expect regulators to step in yet. The concerns — around, for example, anti-competitive concentrations of ownership in some industries — have a lower profile than those of Big Tech.&#xa0;</p> <p>The buoyancy of stock prices&#xa0;is a consequence of central banks' interventions in&#xa0;the bond markets. The impact is also evident in big companies' <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a850474d-b503-4e0d-abda-2668aa80e60a\">cash mountains</a>. The 30 largest investment-grade bond offerings last year in the US raised $289bn. With something like an extra $1.5tn across the S&amp;P 500 in the bank, companies now need to decide what to do with it all. The temptation of cheap cash is to spend it riskily.&#xa0;</p> <p>A nice problem to have, and one not shared by swaths of&#xa0;pandemic-ravaged companies. In Europe one in 10 companies are thought to have sufficient cash to last only six months. An extra €600bn is needed to sustain them, according to the Association for Financial Markets in Europe. It proposes a pan-European <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0f75ffa-174c-473d-99d6-57984ce42557\">hybrid instrument</a> to help fill the gap, though the record of new instruments conjured up by bankers is not encouraging.</p> <p>The cross-channel rail link Eurostar has been particularly badly hit. Travel on its services has dropped almost 99 per cent, and the business has warned it could run out of cash this summer. It wants the UK government to help bail it out. The response, said Lex, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4d9fd32-17c8-4e41-b3a1-ef051e2febea\">should be a resounding <em>non</em></a>. Eurostar is majority-owned by France's SNCF, which itself belongs to the state, while the British government sold its Eurostar stake in 2015. It would be eccentric for British taxpayers to bolster the equity indirectly owned by&#xa0;their French counterparts. The infrastructure will remain. If the operating company failed, a successor would step in post-pandemic if the business was considered viable.&#xa0;</p> <p>That is not to downplay the importance of links between Europe and the UK. They also figure in the post-Brexit debate in Britain about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/343dadd8-823a-48ad-9c41-47e3a013ff26\">the trade-offs</a> involved in securing access to continental markets.&#xa0;In the financial services sector, much depends on how far Britain's regulations are set to diverge from those of the EU. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has talked of the potential gains to competitiveness from a shake-up. But sweeping deregulation, like that of the City's 1986 Big Bang, does not seem likely.&#xa0;As the main architect of the EU rules, the UK industry appears largely content with them.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>And finally, Lex reported on one of the most remarkable of recent style trends. Clunky, comfy Birkenstocks were described by Vogue as “the sandals of 2020”. The German company, which traces its roots to 1774, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d250e5a-6c60-4761-a6b5-50986230880c\">exploring a sale</a> to private equity group CVC. The mooted €4bn valuation looks reasonable, said Lex. It could even be a bargain if the fashion for unfashionable shoes is more than a lockdown fad.</p> <p>Enjoy the weekend,&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Vanessa Houlder<br></strong><em>Lex writer&#xa0;</em></p> <h2>Best of Lex articles</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7cdce392-306c-42a0-b7b6-e5bc51236a93\">Bonds/Roaring Twenties: slender is the fright</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b6fd7753-fb01-4544-9b07-133985eac1d5\">Goldman/BofA: haves and have nots</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/983542f1-151d-4fae-947a-6509967183aa\">BlackRock/Vanguard: ETF leviathans</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a850474d-b503-4e0d-abda-2668aa80e60a\">US cash mountain: the agony of choice</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0f75ffa-174c-473d-99d6-57984ce42557\">EU/capital markets: hybrid vigour</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4d9fd32-17c8-4e41-b3a1-ef051e2febea\">Eurostar: meeting its Waterloo</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/343dadd8-823a-48ad-9c41-47e3a013ff26\">Deregulation in the City/Brexit: the Big Whimper</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d250e5a-6c60-4761-a6b5-50986230880c\">Birkenstock: foot long</a><br></p><p>Source: Vanessa Houlder 2021 'Best of Lex: juiced returns in the New Jazz Age' FT.com 22 January.
