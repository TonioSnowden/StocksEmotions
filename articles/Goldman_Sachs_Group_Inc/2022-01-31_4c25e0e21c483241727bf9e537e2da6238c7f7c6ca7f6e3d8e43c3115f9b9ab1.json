  "title": "Dow slumps and Nasdaq Composite rises in an attempt to end worst month since 2008 financial crisis on a high note",
  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA fell 136 points, or 0.4%, to 34,591.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index SPX was trading 6 points, or 0.1%, higher at 4,437.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP picked up 125 points, or 0.9%, to 13,895.</p><p>For the month, the Dow is headed for a 4.8% decline, the S&amp;P 500 is looking at a 7.1% drop thus far in the month and the Nasdaq Composite was on track for an 11.4% drop, which would mark its worst monthly decline since 2008 and its worst January loss on record, if levels hold.</p><p>Last week, the Dow rose by 1.3% and the S&amp;P 500 gained 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite finished fractionally higher. Heading into the final day of the month, the S&amp;P 500 has slumped by 7% in January.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Speculation about the direction of Federal Reserve interest rates is sure to play a part in driving markets again. The president of the Atlanta Fed, Raphael Bostic, told the Financial Times that the central bank could lift rates in a half-point increment, rather than the usual quarter point, if inflation proves stubborn, though he is sticking with his call for three quarter-point rises for all of 2022.</p><p>“If markets were looking for reassurance from the Federal Reserve last week about the pace of policy tightening, they didn't get it, with [Chair Jerome] Powell insisting that all Fed policy options were open for March and beyond. While this seems entirely sensible; it wasn't the message increasingly nervous markets wanted to hear,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK.</p><p>Read:What to expect from markets in the next six weeks, before the Federal Reserve revamps its easy-money stance</p><p>“In essence it was the Fed saying to markets that the days of hand-holding are over; and that their priority now is inflation, and not the jobs market, as we look towards Friday's jobs report, where the focus has been less on the headline jobs number in recent months, and more on the wages numbers.”</p><p>Earnings season ramps up this week. Strategists at Goldman Sachs say of the S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported, 52% have offered guidance above analyst expectations even as most fourth-quarter results have trumped expectations.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Tesla TSLA shares rose 4% as Credit Suisse upgraded the electric vehicle maker to overweight from neutral. The analysts argued Tesla was caught in the market decline but has robust fundamentals.</p><p>Shares of Spotify were up 5.5% after it said on Sunday that it would add content advisories to certain podcasts and improve transparency about its misinformation policy. Last week, rock icon&#xa0;Neil Young pulled his music&#xa0;from Spotify&#xa0;SPOT,&#xa0;6.10%,&#xa0;citing the spread of disinformation on the streaming-music platform, specifically citing Joe Rogan's popular podcast.</p><p>Shares of Citrix SystemsCTXS,&#xa0;the cloud computing company, confirmed Monday it would be purchased for $16.5 billion, including debt, by Elliott Management and Vista Equity Partners. Shares of the company were down 3.6%.</p><p>How are other assets trading?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y rose 2.4 basis points to 1.80%. Yields and debt prices move opposite each other.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was slightly lower.</p><p>Oil futures CL. 1 rose 68 cents, or 0.8%, to $87.54 a barrel&#xa0;on the New York Mercantile Exchange Gold futures GC00&#xa0;rose 0.6%, or $10.30, to reach $1,796.90 an ounce.</p><p>In European equities, the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP rose 0.4%, while London's FTSE 100 UKX was trading less than 0.1% lower.</p><p>The Hang Seng Index HSI&#xa0;rose 1.1% and Japan's Nikkei 225 NIK. also rose 1.1% and markets in China and in other parts of Asia are closed for Lunar New Year.</p>",
