  "title": "Peloton Rows for Broke --- What's at stake amid Peloton's latest premium hardware launch? Everything",
  "text": "<p>An Oct. 6 Wall Street Journal article based on an interview with Mr. McCarthy suggested he was giving Peloton about six more months to prove itself as a viable stand-alone company. Mr. McCarthy later clarified that there is \"no time clock nipping at our heels,\" adding that if his comments to the Journal suggested there could be, then he misspoke.</p><p>After a whirlwind of business changes since he took the helm in February, Mr. McCarthy's goals suggest Peloton continues to face near-term pressure. He is targeting break-even cash flow by the end of June after burning more than $2.3 billion in the previous fiscal year. And, despite that Peloton logged six straight quarterly losses, including a $1.2 billion loss in the most recent quarter, he is setting his sights on growth.</p><p>So far, not so good, third-party data suggest. Citing Similarweb data, a Morgan Stanley analysis shows that, after Peloton's web traffic fell 41% year on year for its June quarter, traffic in September was down 34% to \"the lowest absolute traffic level since the start of Covid.\" Especially concerning, according to analyst Lauren Schenk, is such metrics buck the usual seasonal trends for the business, with September traffic showing sequential declines for the first time.</p><p>Data from M Science shows subscriber churn reaccelerated in September after improving in August. The firm is expecting a net loss of 7,000 connected fitness subscribers for the period ended Sept. 30 on a sequential basis. Pelotons guidance suggested no change.</p><p>Under Mr. McCarthy, Peloton has been shifting away from its expensive hardware roots toward higher margin subscription revenue. But, as it works to expand beyond its initial affluent customer base, he has introduced a bundled subscription plan that includes content and hardware for one affordable price.</p><p>At a Goldman Sachs conference last month, Mr. McCarthy said he was \"over the moon, excited\" about the potential for this \"fitness-as-a-service\" offering, but said he worries about it initially being profitable. He said he is nervous it will be a product everyone wants but \"the economics are going to blow us up\" because the offering can't immediately earn money.</p><p>The solution for that seems to be a continued reliance on Peloton's premium hardware. Its rower, which became available last month for preorder, is priced at nearly $3,200 with no financing available -- more than twice the cost of its lower-priced bike and nearly as much as its treadmill. It is part of Mr. McCarthy's \"good, better, best\" strategy which he believes can expand Peloton's market size by servicing the gamut of customers from the cost-conscious to those for whom money is no object. Peloton controls more than 70% of the shrinking premium connected fitness market.</p><p>The rower's price amid a worsening economic backdrop suggests failure isn't an option. YipitData shows the rower's preorders contributed about 30% of Peloton's gross connected fitness-product orders in September, noting its initial contribution as a percentage of total orders was more substantial than its latest treadmill launch was last year.</p><p>Similarweb data suggest that excitement was temporary. Worldwide daily desktop visits to Peloton's rower pages spiked Sept. 20 (the day preorders became available) to nearly 37,000 but dwindled to well under 1,000 by Oct. 8. With its digital app, bundled subscriptions, and new availability through outside channels like Amazon, Peloton has been brought to the masses. That doesn't make every customer equally valuable to its business, though.</p><p>The way Peloton gets mocked in popular culture reflects the shift in mood. A Simpsons episode this month shows Marge toiling at self-assembly of her new \"Pedalon\" bike, only to hear her instructor declare in her first class, \"I care about all of you. Except for the woman on the bottom left [of the screen]. Your credit card was declined.\"</p><p>Investors might want to start that time clock after all.</p>",
