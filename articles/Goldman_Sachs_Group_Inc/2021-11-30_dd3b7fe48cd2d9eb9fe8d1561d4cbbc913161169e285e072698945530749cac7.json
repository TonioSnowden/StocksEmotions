  "text": "<p><strong>One stat to start</strong>: Half of the companies that raised more than $1bn at initial public offerings this year are trading below their listing price, despite robust stock markets around the world. Go deeper <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c68c37b-57ae-47b1-98dd-f4a815b3182d\">here</a>. </p> <h2>Back to Square one as Jack exits Twitter</h2> <p>Two years after he tweeted plans to move to Africa, dabble in cryptocurrencies and manage two publicly traded companies thousands of miles away from headquarters, <strong>Jack Dorsey</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf45fd08-51d1-41bb-82cd-b3157a5da055\">out as chief executive</a> of <strong>Twitter</strong>.</p> <p>On Monday, Dorsey turned over the reins of the social network to chief technology officer <strong>Parag Agrawal</strong>, ending his six-year tenure at the helm of the company he co-founded in 2006.</p> <p>Hastening Dorsey's exit was <strong>Elliott Management</strong>, the activist hedge fund that built a 4 per cent position in Twitter in early 2020 and began prodding for his ouster.</p> <p>Elliott and its managing partner <strong>Jesse Cohn</strong> argued that Dorsey had become distracted by his other job as the chief executive of payments company <strong>Square </strong>and outside interests like crypto.</p> <p>When Dorsey took the reins of Twitter in July 2015, it was an interim role that morphed into a permanent one, just as Square began to take off. </p> <p>The dual roles <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25aeb161-7946-4196-84fe-9b415c4af5e9\">soon frustrated investors</a> as Twitter chronically fell short on its growth and monetisation of users, falling far behind social media peers such as <strong>Facebook </strong>and <strong>TikTok</strong>. </p> <p>But its lack of dual class stock and Dorsey's small ownership stake relative to Square, which accounts for most of his $11.8bn net worth, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f3dd95f-8a7c-4f39-991a-87b2bc05691c\">made it ripe for an activist</a>.</p> <p>Instead of an immediate outster, Elliott and <strong>Silver Lake</strong>, which invested $1bn in Twitter as markets cratered in March 2020, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d10bb4ac-6205-11ea-a6cd-df28cc3c6a68\">reached a ceasefire</a> that kept Dorsey in place to guide the company through the coronavirus crisis as a succession plan was forged.</p> <p>A year ago, they agreed on a successor, said a source with direct knowledge of the situation. On Monday morning, CNBC reported Dorsey would be stepping down, causing shares to jump 10 per cent in early trading, before they faded and closed down.</p> <p>Twitter has launched new features including its Spaces audio conversations, tipping features and Twitter Crypto over the past year, but it remains an underperformer, falling in value as the S&amp;P 500 has soared.</p> <p>“You have this amazing platform. Now you need to monetise it,” said the source. </p> <p>That will be up to Agrawal, a PhD graduate in computer science from <strong>Stanford University</strong>, and two relatively neophyte Twitter users in Jesse Cohn and Silver Lake co-chief executive <strong>Egon Durban</strong>, who both <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jessecohn4/status/1465366478040051715\">commended Dorsey</a> in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/egon_durban\">tweets</a> on Monday.</p> <p>While Cohn and Durban now wield outsized influence inside Twitter, their combined following of just 10,381 users on the social network as at press-time is 99.8 per cent smaller than Dorsey's.</p> <p>Fittingly, Dorsey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720\">broadcast to his 5.9m followers</a> that it was time for Twitter to move beyond its visionary but busy founder.</p> <h2>Italy's billionaires face a power struggle</h2> <p>Billionaires' egos, personal rivalries and a series of corporate mishaps are fuelling fierce dramas at the helm of two of Italy's most prominent companies.</p> <p>Investment bank <strong>Mediobanca</strong> and wireless group <strong>Telecom Italia</strong> have come under assault in recent weeks. The former has become the target of one of Italy's richest men, who is turning a personal slight into an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc5f80cb-c06c-408a-a02a-da2d356ac391\">all-out fight</a> that could shake up the storied Italian bank; the latter has one of the world's largest private equity firms knocking on its door. &#xa0;</p> <p>The two unrelated battles, steeped in both political and personal intrigue, highlight the complexity of doing business and the fragility of corporate governance in the EU's third-largest economy. &#xa0;</p> <p>In northern Italy, a tale of vengeance is playing out.</p> <p><strong>Leonardo Del Vecchio</strong>, the billionaire founder of Milan-based eyewear group <strong>Luxottica</strong>, took it as a personal affront when his €500m investment in Italy's main cancer hospital was rejected three years ago. </p> <p>He's since piled pressure on Mediobanca, the hospital's biggest backer, and its chief executive, <strong>Alberto Nagel</strong>, challenging the bank's reliance on its 13 per cent shareholding in insurer <strong>Generali</strong> for profits.</p> <p>One Italian businessman who knows both men said the animosity stems from the refusal of the hospital investment. “That is where all these tensions began,” he told the FT.&#xa0;</p> <p>Del Vecchio, 86, has the help of <strong>Francesco Gaetano Caltagirone</strong>, the 78-year-old deputy vice-chair of Generali who is also a Mediobanca investor. </p> <p>The two ageing tycoons and a third investor formed a group which holds 14 per cent of Generali's shares. The group is challenging Generali over its strategy and management under chief executive <strong>Philippe Donnet</strong>.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Rome, another chief executive also found himself under intense pressure. <strong>Luigi Gubitosi</strong>, head of <strong>Telecom Italia</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a823df92-72af-40c0-87c7-43cb41a28f9a\">resigned</a> on Friday after a clash with the group's biggest shareholder, <strong>Vivendi</strong>. </p> <p>He was the fifth chief of the troubled telecoms group in six years, underscoring the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63eebca7-0d6a-4a4b-8677-9357baa4211c\">instability and poor performance</a> that has racked Telecom Italia for years. </p> <p>Private equity group <strong>KKR</strong>, which last week launched a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eef30c1f-48c4-4ac2-9061-684aa19966c6\">€33bn takeover offer</a> for the ailing telecoms group, will have to win over Vivendi, which already believes the acquisition price is too low, as well as senior Italian politicians including rightwing leader <strong>Matteo Salvini</strong>.</p> <p>Telecom Italia has faced a long and painful history of poor deals and executive decisions since it was privatised in 1997. Investors and chief executives have come and gone while the share price has continued to plummet.</p> <p>For KKR, winning over the power brokers to seal a deal is a major obstacle. But that's before figuring out how to sort out the huge mess it will inherit if successful. </p> <h2>Brookfield sidesteps political quagmire with Boris Johnson's ally</h2> <p><strong>Brookfield Asset Management</strong>'s attempt to sell <strong>PD Ports</strong> after 12 years of ownership was never going to be straightforward. </p> <p>A quick reminder on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fa92b7a-3418-4f3c-ae54-aa8c6fd279dd\">back-story</a>. <strong>Ben Houchen</strong>, the 34-year-old Conservative mayor of Tees Valley (who UK prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> is “obsessed” with, according to a Downing Street insider) was trying to buy it via his <strong>South Tees Development Corporation</strong>. </p> <p>But the organisation is also suing PD Ports over its access rights, a move PD said was designed to “extract a ransom discount” in the sale process. The STDC has denied this. </p> <p>Days after final bids went in last week, advisers on multiple sides of the deal were still scratching their heads. One said they'd never seen an M&amp;A process like it, and another said “it's all getting pretty weird”.&#xa0;</p> <p>On Friday morning, after a last-minute push for higher bids, the months-long sale process fell apart. Read the scoop from DD's Kaye Wiggins <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a304999-c816-4997-930c-1bb5fa583cc2\">here</a>. </p> <p>Perhaps it was about money. None of the bidders seemed willing to pay anywhere close to the £2bn Brookfield had hoped for. </p> <p>But power likely played a role too. One theory is that Brookfield simply didn't want to give Houchen what he wanted, after he dragged them into court. Another is that after a series of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63fb5fbe-90a4-4f4e-80fb-19d5dab028c7\">Conservative party sleaze stories</a>, selling to a politician was deemed too toxic. </p> <p>Either way, Brookfield has walked away from a political quagmire. And Houchen — a Brexiter for whom buying the port was part of a government-backed freeports policy — is left empty-handed. &#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Santander UK</strong> has appointed <strong>Mike Regnier</strong> to replace<strong> Nathan Bostock</strong> as chief executive. Regnier joins from <strong>Yorkshire Building Society</strong>, where he has been chief executive since 2017. He was previously at <strong>Lloyds Bank</strong>, <strong>TSB</strong> and <strong>Halifax</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>India's central bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a27ad53b-ea5c-4b3c-b179-c35d06bb26b9\">has replaced</a> the board of <strong>Anil Ambani</strong>'s<strong> Reliance Capital </strong>and will push the lender into bankruptcy proceedings, marking the latest company in his business empire to collapse. </p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Omers Infrastructure</strong> has promoted <strong>Alastair Hall</strong> to lead its Europe business, based in London. He was previously global head of investment strategy and partnerships. </p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Law firm <strong>White &amp; Case</strong> has hired<strong> David Lewis</strong> as an M&amp;A partner in London.
