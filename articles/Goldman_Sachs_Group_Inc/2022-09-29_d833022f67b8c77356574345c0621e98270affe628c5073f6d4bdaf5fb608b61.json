  "title": "Families of Three Uvalde Shooting Survivors Sue School District, Gun Manufacturers, Others; Civil lawsuit, filed in federal court, seeks damages for the three survivors",
  "text": "<p>The lawsuit asks for damages for the families, the amount of which would be determined through a trial by jury.</p><p>The mass shooting at Robb Elementary School this spring was the deadliest at a U.S. school since the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newton, Conn., in 2012. The massacre—and the delayed response by law enforcement—left the local community reeling.</p><p>A recent review by Texas lawmakers found systematic failures by hundreds of armed law-enforcement officers led to their delayed confrontation with the shooter, potentially costing lives. A team of Border Patrol agents confronted and killed the 18-year-old gunman more than an hour after police began to arrive, according to the report.</p><p>The school board in Uvalde voted unanimously in August to fire district Police Chief Pete Arredondo, who oversaw the heavily criticized response to the mass shooting.</p><p>The lawsuit filed this week named 10 defendants, including Mr. Arredondo, the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District, the city, the acting chief of the Uvalde Police Department at the time of the shooting, the elementary school's former principal, as well as gun manufacturers and a gun dealer, among others.</p><p>The suit comes as students and teachers in the Texas town begin school again, three months after the massacre.</p><p>\"These kids just came back to school, and we are already hearing that many of them are scared for their lives,\" said Monique Alarcon, one of the attorneys at Baum Hedlund Aristei &amp; Goldman representing the families, in a statement Thursday. \"It's clear that this unspeakable trauma will be with them for a long time, perhaps for the rest of their lives. This case is about ensuring that they have access to the care and resources they need.\"</p><p>Write to Jennifer Calfas at jennifer.calfas@wsj.com</p><p>Families of Three Uvalde Shooting Survivors Sue School District, Gun Manufacturers, Others</p>",
