  "text": "<p>The S&amp;P 500 was recently up 0.2%, reversing earlier declines. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 63 points, or 0.2%. The Nasdaq Composite Index hovered around the flatline.</p><p>Major indexes had pulled back this week as investors awaited the update from the U.S. central bank. Some investors said that uncertainty about the Fed's next moves, rather than unhappiness with the potential changes in monetary policy, may have caused stocks to slip in recent sessions.</p><p>Accommodative monetary policy has helped propel U.S. indexes to dozens of records since the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic sent stocks swooning in early 2020. But surging consumer prices have intensified the focus by Fed officials on curbing inflation. Investors are eager for the central bank to shed light on its plans for ending asset purchases and raising rates.</p><p>\"There's a lot on the table for the Fed that investors are concerned about,\" said Alex Chaloff, co-head of investment strategies at Bernstein Private Wealth Management.</p><p>U.S. inflation hit a 39-year high in November and producer prices also leapt.</p><p>\"What's really coming in context is that inflation is hotter for longer than expected and the Fed is acknowledging it,\" said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank, before the Fed's afternoon announcement. \"There's also the view that new variants are not just a concern for growth, but a concern for inflation.\"</p><p>Oil prices ticked higher after the Fed statement Wednesday, with global benchmark Brent crude adding 0.4%. The International Energy Agency said Tuesday it had reduced its forecast for 2022 energy demand, due to Omicron, and cut its supply outlook.</p><p>In Europe, the energy crisis intensified, with benchmark European gas prices having jumped by more than a quarter over the past week. Falling temperatures and fears of disruption from the military buildup on Russia's border with Ukraine have sent prices higher.</p><p>More information is emerging about the Omicron variant. The first large real-world study showed that the efficacy of two Pfizer shots declined against the strain, both for infection and hospitalization. The variant accounts for about 3% of cases in the U.S.</p><p>\"Companies and consumers have become very good at adapting to these variants,\" Ms. Dwek said. The key risk is supply-chain disruptions lasting longer than expected because of China's zero-Covid policy, she added.</p><p>Retail sales rose by a seasonally-adjusted 0.3% in November, slowing from October's pace. Economists had predicted an 0.8% increase amid the holiday shopping season.</p><p>U.S. government bond yields rose. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note advanced to 1.470% Wednesday from 1.437% Tuesday.</p><p>Among individual stocks, Eli Lilly shares climbed 8.8% after the pharmaceutical company raised its full-year guidance. Shares of chemical firm Albemarle slid 3.9% after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the stock.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 0.3%. In Asia, most major benchmarks closed down. The Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.4%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 0.9%. Data showed China's economic activity slowed in November, driven by a property slump and sluggish consumer spending.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Karen Langley at karen.langley@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks Advance as Investors Scan Fed Decision</p>",
