  "title": "Puff Bar Skirts Restrictions On Fruit-Flavor E-Cigarettes",
  "text": "<p>The FDA, which regulates tobacco products and smoking-cessation devices like nicotine gum, said it was aware of Puff Bar's move. An agency spokeswoman declined to say whether the agency's Puff Bar ban was still applicable, noting that she couldn't comment on an ongoing investigation.</p><p>It's unclear who owns the brand; the operators of the Puff Bar website didn't respond to requests for comment. The brand was previously owned by Cool Clouds Distribution Inc., a California company. Its chief executive said he sold it last year to its Chinese manufacturer, DS Technology Licensing LLC, because of FDA scrutiny and criticism that the vaporizers were attracting young people. A lawyer representing DS Technology said it no longer owned the brand, had stopped exporting Puff Bar products to the U.S. and had no knowledge of the new products.</p><p>Puff Bar has a sleek, USB-drive shape similar to the market-leading e-cigarette, Juul. But while Juul's device uses refill pods, Puff Bar is designed for one-time use. Puff Bar vaporizers come in more than a dozen flavors and cost between $9 and $15 on the brand's website. The devices deliver between 200 and 800 puffs each, depending on the size.</p><p>Puff Bar's sales surged in early 2020 when federal restrictions took sweet and fruity e-cigarette refill pods like Juul's off the market. Because Puff Bar devices couldn't be refilled, the FDA's initial flavor restrictions didn't apply to them.</p><p>Underage vaping dropped after those restrictions were implemented, but disposable e-cigarette use among children and teens jumped, according to a federal survey conducted from January to March 2020.</p><p>Antitobacco groups and lawmakers last year called for a ban on Puff Bar, which had become the leading disposable brand. In response, Puff Bar said it was voluntarily stopping its U.S. sales. In July, the FDA formally ordered the company to halt its sales.</p><p>In a letter to Puff Bar on July 20, the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products said that Puff Bar products hadn't been authorized for sale by the agency and that the company had made unauthorized claims on its website that its vaporizers were less harmful than traditional cigarettes.</p><p>Puff Bar stopped selling vaporizers on its website, but retail-store sales of Puff Bar continued. The brand's sales have plummeted this year as a result of improved compliance with the FDA's order, said Goldman Sachs analyst Bonnie Herzog.</p><p>In May 2020, DS Technology, which then owned Puff Bar, said in a news release that the anticounterfeit verification system at puffbar.com had \"identified thousands of retail stores at which consumers bought devices which failed the check.\" DS Technology that month sued more than a dozen Chinese and American companies it said were selling knockoffs or counterfeit Puff Bars.</p><p>Puff Bar in an email to customers last month said it had upgraded its vaporizers and they now contained \"tobacco-free nicotine.\" The health claims cited by the FDA in July 2020 have been removed from the brand's website, where online sales have resumed.</p>",
