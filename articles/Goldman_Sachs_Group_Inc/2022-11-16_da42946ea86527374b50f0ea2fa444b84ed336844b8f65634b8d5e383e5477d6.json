  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  The quest for a treatment for Alzheimer's disease has been a roller-coaster ride for patients as well as investors. No company has embodied the ups and downs of that ride more than Biogen. </p><p>\n  Just two months ago, Biogen looked like a sinking ship. The stock was trading near a 10-year low in the wake of the failed rollout of its Alzheimer's drug Aduhelm, sales of its other top medications were shrinking due to competition and it faced a leadership void as its chief executive officer was set to depart. </p><p>\n  Fast forward to today and the mood couldn't be more different. The stock is up about 50% since positive results were announced in late September for its other Alzheimer's treatment, lecanemab. Last week, the company hired former Sanofi CEO Chris Viehbacher as its new leader. And on Monday, a potential competitor, Roche, said its Alzheimer's experimental treatment failed to significantly slow cognitive decline. </p><p>\n  Yet many investors are still reluctant to embrace the story, partly because of how badly they got burned last time around. Back then, excitement was followed by stinging disappointment when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services decided not to pay for Aduhelm. The drug had been approved by the Food and Drug Administration, but the decision became controversial after critics said it relied on unconvincing data and went against the recommendation of the FDA's own advisory panel. </p><p>\n  The stock price reflects the tempered optimism. Even though the preliminary results released by Biogen and its partner Eisai showed that lecanemab looked better than Aduhelm, the stock is still trading around $300, far below last year's high of $415. </p><p>\n  That means there is still time for investors to jump in. Full data from the trial will be presented for the first time at an Alzheimer's conference scheduled for Nov. 29. If the data confirm the positive results the company announced earlier this year, Biogen could be looking at a drug with $14 billion in peak sales, with profits split with Eisai, according to Salveen Richter, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. \"If the data looks good, the clinical risk is removed,\" she said. </p><p>\n  That still leaves the regulatory risk, of course. The FDA is almost certain to approve the drug following its greenlighting of Aduhelm. But strong data don't fully guarantee that Medicare will agree to pay for the drug, given its decision to impose restrictive reimbursement conditions for all anti-amyloid drugs -- which target an unusual buildup of the protein in patients' brains -- when it decided not to cover Aduhelm earlier this year. </p><p>\n  Ms. Richter says that if the full data confirm the functional improvement for patients as well as the relatively strong safety results announced in the release by the companies in September, Medicare is likely to provide full coverage. </p><p>\n  Another thing going for Biogen is that its competition is looking weaker. Biogen shares rose on Monday after Roche reported negative results from a pair of clinical trials investigating its own anti-amyloid treatments. Roche's failure \"takes out the biggest competitive risk to lecanemab,\" wrote Brian Skorney, an analyst at Baird. Biogen's only competition now could come from Eli Lilly, whose results will read out next year. </p><p>\n  Even if all goes well and Medicare covers the drug, investors are still having a hard time figuring out the real potential for the drug. Analyst estimates for the drug's peak sales range from a few hundred million dollars to billions. Mr. Skorney says that is largely because it is unclear whether a cumbersome, regularly infused intravenous treatment can really gain a massive market. </p><p>\n  But with little alternative for early Alzheimer's patients, it seems hard to imagine that a drug with solid data and coverage from Medicare doesn't become a blockbuster treatment. For Biogen, the second time could be the charm. </p><p></p>",
