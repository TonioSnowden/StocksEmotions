  "title": "Business News: Blackstone CEO Gets a Windfall",
  "text": "<p>The eye-popping figures, the biggest ever for Mr. Schwarzman, make him one of the highest-paid executives on Wall Street -- if not the highest. They are a reflection of how pivotal the past year has been for Blackstone's business. The firm's 2021 financial performance broke records by nearly every key measure, with assets under management reaching $880.9 billion by the end of the fourth quarter, as initiatives to reach wealthy individuals and expand its base of insurance clients helped Blackstone further access big new pools of capital.</p><p>Including dividends, Blackstone shares have more than doubled since the beginning of 2021 versus a 19% total return for the S&amp;P 500. The firm's market capitalization now stands at $155 billion, more than four times that of Apollo Global Management Inc. -- its closest private-equity peer -- and well beyond that of Wall Street heavyweight Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p><p>Like its peers, Blackstone took the step in 2019 of converting from a publicly traded partnership to a corporation, a move that has helped propel its performance as more investors own the stock. But the firm has maintained a supervoting share structure even as rivals have abandoned theirs in favor of a one-share, one-vote model. Mr. Schwarzman owns preferred shares that give him substantial control over certain aspects of the business.</p><p>Mr. Schwarzman, 75 years old, co-founded Blackstone in 1985 and is valued at an estimated $37.3 billion, according to Forbes. While he continues to serve as its CEO, he has delegated much of the day-to-day responsibility of running the firm to Blackstone President Jonathan Gray.</p><p>Shares of Blackstone, including dividends, have more than quadrupled since 2018 when Mr. Gray assumed the role from his predecessor, Hamilton \"Tony\" James. That compares with a 65% total return for the S&amp;P.</p><p>Mr. Gray took home $323.8 million in 2021, including $167.2 million in dividends and $156.6 million in investment-gain and other compensation.</p><p>Neither he nor Mr. Schwarzman received a cash bonus.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
