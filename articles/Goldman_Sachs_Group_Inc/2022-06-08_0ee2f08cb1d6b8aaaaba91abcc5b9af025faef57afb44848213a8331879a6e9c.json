  "text": "<p>Credit Suisse has issued its third profit warning since January and will accelerate cost-cutting measures, as market volatility pushes back the prospect of a recovery for a bank beset by crises in recent years.</p> <p>Shares in Credit Suisse fell 6 per cent in morning trading following the announcement, taking their decline for the year to 30 per cent, but shot up in the afternoon to above 4 per cent following a report from <a href=\"https://insideparadeplatz.ch/2022/06/08/state-street-will-offenbar-cs-uebernehmen/\">Swiss blog Inside Paradeplatz</a> that US custody bank State Street Corporation was preparing a bid for the business. </p> <p>Credit Suisse declined to comment on the story, while State Street said: “We are not going to respond to an earlier news report. As we've previously discussed, we are focused on our pending acquisition of Brown Brothers Harriman's Investors Services business.”</p> <p>Credit Suisse warned on Wednesday that it would probably report a loss in the second quarter as its investment banking division was hit by market volatility from the war in Ukraine, the tapering of pandemic stimulus measures and monetary tightening in response to rising <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/global-inflation\">global inflation</a>.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the bank said it had suffered from “weak customer flows and ongoing client deleveraging, notably in the [Asia-Pacific] region”.</p> <p>The group's investment banking division also struggled in April and May because of low equity and debt issuance and widening credit spreads as countries around the world <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/addbf3ca-9859-47cb-bb8f-56a34aa13930\">tightened monetary policy</a>.</p> <p>“The main culprit is once again the investment bank, where Credit Suisse expects the fourth quarterly loss over the last six quarters,” said Vontobel analyst Andreas Venditti. </p> <p>“As a consequence, Credit Suisse announces an acceleration of its cost [cutting] initiatives. Similarly to cost measures executed in the past, the consequence is likely to be a further erosion in staff morale and therefore another negative impact on revenues.”</p> <p>Credit Suisse executives are also bracing for a potential round of job cuts and a freeze on hiring in the group's investment bank in the second half of the year along with other competitors, according to people with knowledge of the planning.</p> <p>In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, Credit Suisse's global head of investment banking and capital markets David Miller said: “I've been using the entire first five months of this year running around seeing clients and telling them we are back.”</p> <p>But other senior managers were preparing for a reduction in the bank's headcount later this year should conditions fail to improve, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The plans include laying off underperformers, not replacing departing staff and hiring fewer graduates.</p> <p>Revenues at investment banks across the board are down significantly from record levels last year and many are preparing for staff reductions, according to analysts.</p> <p>Credit Suisse declined to comment on the prospect of job cuts, saying the cost savings announced did not include headcount reduction. A person briefed on the bank's strategy said there were no immediate plans to reduce staffing numbers. </p> <p>In January, Credit Suisse warned it would report a loss for the final quarter of 2021 on the back of a slowdown in revenues at its investment bank. Three months later, it announced that it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71912244-17e7-4e0a-9df5-cc270044f70a\">expected a first-quarter loss</a> due to an increase in legal provisions.</p> <p>The bank is due to publish its second-quarter results on July 27, while chief executive Thomas Gottstein will provide a trading update on Thursday at a Goldman Sachs event.</p> <p>Credit Suisse is also holding a day of presentations for investors on June 28 to showcase several of its new senior executives.</p> <p>It announced an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef2dbc9d-e65b-49fa-91bb-0a4b2cf69bfa\">overhaul of top executive roles</a> in April after posting a loss in the first quarter as it sought to move on from a succession of recent crises.</p> <p>“As we look forward to the second half, the year 2022 will remain one of transition for Credit Suisse,” the bank said on Wednesday. “Given the economic and market environment, we are accelerating our cost initiatives across the group with the aim of maximising savings from 2023 onwards.”</p> <p>Credit Suisse added that income from advisory services had benefited from market volatility this quarter.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/44f4b910-80f3-4728-a846-89e768b8a099.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Owen Walker in London and William Langley in Hong Kong 2022 'Credit Suisse issues third profit warning this year' FT.com 8 June.
