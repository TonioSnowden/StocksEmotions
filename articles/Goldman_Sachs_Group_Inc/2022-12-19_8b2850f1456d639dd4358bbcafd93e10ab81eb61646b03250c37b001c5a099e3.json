  "title": "Corporate bonds on pace for worst year in history with negative 14% return",
  "text": "<p>November's sharp rally helped corporate bonds recover from the year's worst levels, but it wasn't nearly enough (see chart) to keeping a dismal year for corporate bonds out of the record books.</p><p>In prior years, a total return pullback of about -5% for investment-grade corporate bonds would have been notable, as was the case in the wake of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis.</p><p>But 2022 has been an entirely different environment, with the carnage in corporate bonds not stemming from a wave of company defaults but mostly to the Federal Reserve's rapid pace of rate hikes. Its policy rate shot up to a 4.25% to 4.5% range last week, from near zero in March.</p><p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and other U.S. central bankers also said the benchmark Fed rate could now peak above 5% next year, and stay there for a while, until inflation finds a sustained path lower.</p><p>See: Fed officials reinforce stern message of slowing inflation by higher interest rates</p><p>\"The quasi-entirety of this year's decline has been driven by the historic selloff in the rates market,\" the Goldman credit research team wrote, in a weekly client note. \"Excess returns, while likely to finish the year in negative territory, have held up better at -1.2%.\"</p><p>Bonds prices also fell dramatically in 2022, reflecting the diminished appeal of low yielding assets in an environment of both high inflation and climbing interest rates. Goldman's team pegged a record share of investment-grade corporate bonds as trading below $80 prices this year. Prices below $70 are often considered distressed.</p><p>Many individuals gain exposure to bonds through exchange-traded funds. Shares of the large $18.6 billion iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF LQD were down 18.6% on the year through Monday, according to FactSet. That compares with a roughly 13.4% decline for the $82.8 billion iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF AGG, a fund that tracks the benchmark Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.</p><p>With U.S. inflation showing signs of slowing and a peak terminal Fed rate in sight, many bond investors and analysts expect 2023 to be a year of recovery for many fixed-income sectors that currently offer some of the highest yields in a decade, particularly if only a mild recession hits.</p><p>\"We continue to expect a notable improvement in the return profile for total return investors in 2023, and a move into positive territory for excess returns,\" the Goldman team wrote about investment-grade corporate bonds.</p><p>Stocks were lower again Monday, with the S&amp;P 500 index SPX down nearly 300 points, or 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was 1.2% lower and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP was off 1.6%.</p><p>Corporate bonds on pace for worst year in history with negative 14% return</p>",
