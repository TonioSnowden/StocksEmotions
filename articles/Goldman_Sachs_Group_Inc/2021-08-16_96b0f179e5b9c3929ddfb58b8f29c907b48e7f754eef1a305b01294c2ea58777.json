  "title": "Streetwise: Something Weird Is Going On in the Treasury Market",
  "text": "<p>My take: Investors came to the realization that the huge post-pandemic debt burden will keep rates lower than in the past, while they kept faith that inflation will be manageable. There is little to indicate investors fear a recession-inducing mistake by the Federal Reserve, and they aren't expecting runaway inflation either.</p><p>The market response from March to the start of this month can be thought of as pricing in a repeat of the secular stagnation brought on by the 2008 financial crisis, with the twist of slightly higher inflation than in the past decade. Pramod Atluri, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Capital Group, says this is akin to \"too much debt and too much money in the system.\"</p><p>That means low bond yields, as debt holds back the economy and the Fed is unable to raise rates much. It means corporate bonds do fine, because there is so much money chasing safe returns that even fairly risky companies can refinance. And it is great for stocks, as the past decade shows, especially those able to offer reliable growth in a weak economy -- broadly, big technology companies.</p><p>Yet, Treasury yields seem to have fallen much too far from March to July, before an inexplicably large bounce. \"It is a conundrum,\" said Peter Oppenheimer, chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs. \"The scale [of the moves in yields] seems at odds with the degree of concerns.\"</p><p>This month, the market again has started anticipating economic expansion, with a rise in Treasury yields, stable junk-bond spreads and a swing back from tech and other growth stocks to economically sensitive cyclicals, especially banks and industrials.</p><p>Once again, though, the size of moves still seems extreme. Mr. Atluri says it is possible that with so much money sloshing around, the levels of markets carry less information than their direction; so Treasury yields rise or fall on good and bad news as normal, but sometimes go much further than they would have in the past.</p><p>Markets also have been struggling to come to grips with the spread of the Delta variant of Covid-19. The variant's spread in the U.K. coincided with the fall in bond yields, while the switch to rising yields coincided with an improvement in the U.K.'s hospital admissions, as quantitative strategist Andrew Lapthorne at Societe Generale points out. Again, though, it is deeply strange that stocks should reach new highs both when bond yields were falling (and stocks were driven by tech) and when bond yields were rising (and stocks were led by cyclicals).</p><p>And there is one more oddity that is far harder to understand: By Aug. 3, yields on 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, reached minus 1.2%, the lowest point for inflation-adjusted yields in history.</p><p>It could only make sense if investors were expecting stagflation, or weak economic growth combined with higher inflation. But if the risk of stagflation were rising, investors should be buying gold -- which usually rises when TIPS yields fall -- and dumping the junkiest corporate bonds, as defaults would be sure to rise. Instead, the relationship between gold and TIPS broke down, while junk bond yields rose only a little from what had been close to record low spreads over Treasurys.</p><p>We can square the circle by dismissing the signal from TIPS. It is never satisfactory to think the market just wasn't working, but TIPS yields seem to have fallen dramatically more than they should, which I can just about believe for a market that is anyway fairly illiquid when traders have decamped to the beach. It is even easier to believe given the rebound of the past two weeks, which has brought yields back up to a more reasonable level, albeit still deeply negative, on the back of some signs of economic strength.</p><p>Perhaps July was just a summer anomaly. But with the wild excesses of meme stocks, clean energy, electric cars and SPACs still fresh in the memory, I'm not confident that the return of normal market relationships will last.</p>",
