  "title": "A bit excessive? Oil traders have priced in a three-month halt to global air travel, says Goldman Sachs",
  "text": "<p>That's the equivalent, say analysts led by Damien Courvalin, of “not a single plane flying around the world for three months.” It's also equivalent to a lockdown half as intense as the second quarter of 2020, shortly after the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19 first started affecting countries outside of China.</p><p>Not surprisingly, these analysts view the reaction as excessive. Their view is that a new variant, combined with the global release of reserves, represents only a $5 per barrel downside to its $85 forecast for the next few months.</p><p>“In fact, there's still potential for offsetting bullish developments via the lack of progress in Iranian negotiations (where we had expected a supply ramp up beginning in 2Q22). OPEC+ freezing its production hike for one month when it meets on Thursday as well as the current ramp-up in gas-to-oil substitution could in fact offset nearly half of the combined negative hits of this new COVID variant and SPR releases in the base scenario,” they said.</p><p>Crude futures CL.1 rallied nearly $3 per barrel on Wednesday morning but still were trading below $70, after trading as high as $84.97 earlier in the month.</p><p>Natural-gas futures NG00, by contrast, fell 4%.</p>",
