  "title": "Lollapalooza's 2022 lineup includes Dua Lipa, Machine Gun Kelly, and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon…seriously",
  "text": "<p>So imagine the collective excitement on Tuesday when iconic Chicago rock fest Lollapalooza announced its 2022 lineup on Twitter:</p><p>https://twitter.com/lollapalooza/status/1506284781943889925Looks like fun! Dua Lipa! Doja Cat! Metallica! Charli XCX not even on the top three lines!</p><p>Who else? Eurovision Song Contest winners Måneskin, emo legends Dashboard Confessional, and David Solomon.</p><p>Yes, that David Solomon, the chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs GS…seriously.</p><p>Solomon's electronic dance music alter ego, DJ D-Sol, became public knowledge shortly before he took the reins at Goldman in 2018. DJ D-Sol released a few tracks online and played regular gigs at a Brooklyn club, and summer gigs in the Hamptons,</p><p>His 2020 performance at a Hamptons fundraiser created something of a sensation after it was revealed that the event flouted some COVID regulations at the height of the pandemic, and happened just days after Goldman reached a $3.9 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice in relation to charges of fraud stemming from the firms dealings in the Malaysian 1MDB scandal.</p><p>Solomon has been distancing himself from the DJ D-Sol name as of late however, and his Spotify page shows that he has re-branded as simply “David Solomon” in both his work and music careers.</p><p>But while Solomon's Goldman gig paid out at $35 million in 2021, his DJing is less remunerative. He has publicly pledged many times that he gives all proceeds from his download and ticket sales to charity.</p><p>Goldman declined to comment on its CEO's upcoming Lollapalooza set.</p><p>So what should hip concertgoers expect to hear from the 60-year-old dance music impresario when they congregate in Chicago's Grant Park this July?</p><p>If Solomon/D-Sol's past is a prologue to this big gig, we can see a set list that includes his debut 2018 hit “Don't Stop,” which any Goldman employees in attendance might want to hear as “Don't Stop…going back to the office“, followed by his track “Someone Like You,” perhaps a nod to Vladimir Putin forcing Solomon's hand on shutting down Goldman's operations in Russia, leading into a hardcore remix of “Only a Fool” and “Rescue Me”, useful ditties after Solomon walked back his comments that it wasn't Wall Street's job to “ostracize Russia” in the early days of the invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>And he'll likely end with “Heatwave,” as a nod to both those Midwest summer temperatures and what could be a blooming bromance with fellow Lollapalooza headliner, Machine Gun Kelly.</p>",
