  "text": "<p>A Labour government would set up a state-backed group to boost small businesses by linking up institutional investors and venture capital firms, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves will announce on Thursday.</p> <p>Reeves will say that a “British Tibi” — a reference to the French technology finance scheme — could strengthen engagement between investors and venture capital groups to improve the flow of money into young companies.</p> <p>The plan is one of several recommendations made in a “start-up review” for Labour by former Treasury minister Lord Jim O'Neill, which will be unveiled on Thursday at a business event hosted by Reeves and party leader Sir Keir Starmer.</p> <p>The event — involving 350 business leaders — is part of Labour's attempts to be seen as a pro-enterprise party despite its longstanding financial links with the trade union movement.</p> <p>The pivot is part of a broader effort by Starmer to take the party down a more centrist route followed by former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, who won three general elections a generation ago.</p> <p>O'Neill, former chair of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, is a cross-party peer who previously served as a Treasury minister in David Cameron's Conservative government where he was responsible for the “Northern Powerhouse” project to boost economic growth in the north of England.</p> <p>He will say that British start-ups have “huge potential” to improve the UK's economic fortunes far beyond London.</p> <p>The French Tibi scheme was launched in 2020 by President Emmanuel Macron and has since secured over €18bn of commitments from institutional investors for French tech companies.</p> <p>Under O'Neill's plan, the UK scheme would match institutional investors with an accredited list of VC firms, with the former asked to allocate a small proportion of their funds to the latter.</p> <p>Kwasi Kwarteng, former Tory chancellor, proposed a similar idea in July when he was business secretary, however, the proposal ran into some resistance from the Treasury.</p> <p>The report will also recommend that the government give the British Business Bank, the state-backed economic development investor, greater independence, the ability to leverage external funds and more focus on encouraging the growth of entrepreneurial clusters around universities.</p> <p>It will also propose the introduction of a new annual “dashboard” summarising each university's record in creating “spinouts”, businesses based on academic research that would otherwise be likely to go unexploited. </p> <p>“All universities [should] offer a range of options for spinout founders to choose from, including an option where the university keeps a relatively small stake of equity,” it will say.</p> <p>The O'Neill review involved a panel that spoke to more than 120 industry leaders at roundtables across the country.</p> <p>Reeves will hail the report as a “radical plan to make Britain the high-growth, start-up hub of the world”, telling the event in Canary Wharf: “These are challenging times. But I know the spirit of enterprise, of creativity, of endeavour are as present in Britain today as they have ever been.”</p>&#xa0;&#xa0;<p>Source: Jim Pickard in London 2022 'Labour to unveil new plan for supporting UK small business' FT.com 7 December.
