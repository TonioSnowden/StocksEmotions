  "text": "<p>But to American consumers, it will feel more like oil is trading at $160 a barrel as limited capacity at the refineries that process crude into petroleum products like gasoline and jet fuel continue to struggle to ramp up their processing capacity swiftly enough to satisfy growing demand.</p><p>The price of oil has already surged more than 50% so far this year, driving the average price of gas in the U.S. to nearly $5 a gallon, according to AAA. On Tuesday, futures for both Brent BRN00and WTI crude WBS.1– the international and U.S. crude oil benchmarks – were trading at just under $120 a barrel.</p><p>And although the longest global oil supply deficit on record ended in April after nearly two years, the Goldman team expects a resurgence in Chinese demand will more than offset the surprising durability in Russian crude exports.</p><p>\"Oil's structural deficit therefore remains unresolved, with in fact an even tighteroil market through April than we had expected. Supply remains inelastic tohigher prices,\" Currie and his team wrote.\"</p><p>Major oil producers have limited capacity to ramp production further in the near term – and those that do have the spare capacity will likely be hesitant to fully utilize it due to a lack of exemptions from OPEC+ drilling quotas.</p><p>While OPEC+ agreed during its June meeting to boost production , Currie writes that members' ability to aggressively accelerate drilling faces several challenges. One is that drilling activity has languished at half of its level from the first quarter of 2020 for the past 18 months, and any surge in production would likely take months to implement.</p><p>Another is Russia's lack of exemption from its OPEC quota at the Junemeeting. According to the Goldman team, this would suggest that the few OPEC+ members who have capacity to spare won't be allowed to compensate for the looming jump in demand from China. Goldman illustrated its outlook for global oil inventories in the chart below.</p><p>As MarketWatch reported earlier this month, the lack of sufficient spare capacity represents a binding constraint for OPEC+ members trying to pick up the slack as Europe turns away from Russian crude.</p><p>The Goldman team recommended a handful of trades to clients interested in betting on a continued move higher in energy prices, including buying gasoil futures GAS00 set to expire in December 2022, and Brent crude futures set to expire in December 2023. As a \"corollary\" to these recommended trades, the Goldman team also said it expects energy stocks to continue to outperform.</p><p>Goldman Sachs expects oil prices to surge to nearly $140 a barrel this summer – but it will feel like $160</p>",
