  "title": "World News: China Loosens Some Covid Rules",
  "text": "<p>The new guidance shortened the mandatory quarantine time for inbound travelers and for those identified as close contacts, but notably didn't end policies intended to vanquish Covid, insisting that the country \"firmly stick to the dynamic zero-Covid policy.\"</p><p>Even so, the changes fueled a surge of Chinese and Hong Kong stocks, which also were boosted by signs of easing U.S. inflation. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index jumped 7.7% in its biggest single-day rally since March, taking its rise so far this month to about 18%.</p><p>The Shanghai Composite closed 1.7% higher on Friday, while China's CSI 300 gauge of the largest mainland-listed stocks rose 2.8%. U.S. listed China stocks also gained.</p><p>Interest in flights to China climbed, with Chinese online travel agency Trip.com reporting that bookings doubled Friday compared with the same period Thursday.</p><p>While the market was buoyant, economists generally were more restrained. Goldman Sachs described the moves as \"marginal,\" amounting to little more than \"fine-tuning.\"</p><p>\"The impact of such changes on domestic economic activity is likely to be limited as long as the zero-Covid policy remains,\" the investment bank told clients in a note.</p><p>The easing of controls came even as China confronted its worst outbreak in more than six months, with infections spread across the country. Nationwide, new cases topped 10,000 on Thursday, a number not seen since Shanghai was placed under strict lockdown for two months from late March.</p><p>It wasn't immediately clear how the changes would affect continuing efforts to curb the spread of Covid, and whether those facing lockdown in some parts of the country could expect restrictions to ease. About four million people were told to stay home in parts of Guangzhou, the southern economic hub, as authorities tightened controls to halt a growing outbreak this week.</p><p>Health officials in the city of more than 18 million people said Friday they would begin implementing the eased restrictions, including releasing from quarantine anyone who had been in proximity to close contacts of positive cases, state media reported.</p><p>Xi Jinping, China's leader, signaled at a Communist Party congress last month that the country's strict zero-Covid policies helped it weather the pandemic, and would continue. But the economic impact has forced adjustments to ease the burden on businesses and citizens, analysts say.</p><p>Under the new measures, temporary bans on routes operated by airlines found to have brought passengers infected with Covid-19 into the country have been dropped. Travelers from other countries must now quarantine for eight days -- five in a hotel or government center and three days of home health monitoring -- down from a total of 10 days, it said. Passengers would have to take only one test before boarding a flight.</p><p>At home, the scope of close contacts subject to isolation and mass testing has been narrowed, a move that could alleviate one of the biggest sources of resentment among the many millions of residents who have been subject to stay-at-home orders simply for being in proximity to someone who was close to a positive case. Quarantine for close contacts was cut to eight days from 10.</p><p>The designation of areas at risk -- the basis for restrictions on people's movements -- also has changed, the health commission said, with high-risk areas limited to residential blocks rather than entire districts.</p><p>Covid controls have continued to disrupt the economy in recent days, with the Beijing International Automotive Exhibition, the country's biggest auto show, saying Thursday it would cancel this year's event. Its rival Guangzhou show, set to open this month, was postponed because of the outbreak there.</p><p>Apple Inc. warned this week of delays in shipments for some new iPhones after lockdowns at supplier Foxconn Technology Group's main plant in Zhengzhou, which accounts for more than half of global shipments of the handsets.</p><p>One concern driving zero-Covid policies has been fears that a severe outbreak could cause widespread deaths among the elderly, who are less likely to be vaccinated. At the Politburo Standing Committee meeting on Thursday, Mr. Xi said that more effort must be placed on developing vaccines and inoculating vulnerable populations.</p>",
