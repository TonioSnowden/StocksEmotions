  "title": "Medline Deal Is Biggest in Decade --- Appetite for large LBOs revives, with medical-supply firm valued at $30 billion",
  "text": "<p>Merger-and-acquisition activity has been busy across the board this year, with a string of large tie-ups lately including Discovery Inc's $53 billion deal to combine with AT&amp;T Inc.'s Warner Media arm and Canadian National Railway Co. outbidding a rival to buy Kansas City Southern. In the U.S., $1.24 trillion of deals have been signed in 2021, up more than fourfold compared with the same period last year when lockdowns crimped economic activity and acquisition volume, according to Dealogic.</p><p>But private-equity firms, tasked with putting over a trillion dollars to work, had largely shied away from the biggest deals. Until now.</p><p>Big buyouts, which involve borrowing large amounts of money to amplify potential returns, all but disappeared after several of them performed poorly or filed for bankruptcy after the financial crisis, weighed down by enormous sums of debt.</p><p>Between 2005 and 2007, private-equity firms sealed 18 deals valued at $10 billion or more, according to Dealogic. Since then, they had only struck 10, before Medline.</p><p>There had been signs firms were regaining their taste for big buyouts, as they approached targets including Japan's Toshiba Corp. and Dutch telecommunications company Royal KPN NV. But until now, no such deal had gotten over the finish line.</p><p>\"This could be the transaction that opens up the floodgates,\" said Dusty Philip, co-chairman of global M&amp;A at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which advised Medline. \"You have ideal conditions for large LBOs: low interest rates, aggressive financing markets and a significant amount of dry powder.\"</p><p>Indeed, buyout firms are sitting on more than $1.6 trillion of unspent cash, according to data provider Preqin -- and that doesn't take into account the billions that big institutional investors are clamoring to invest directly in deals.</p><p>That three private-equity firms came together -- they are equal partners -- harks to an era before the crisis, when club deals were common. They fell out of favor as firms have preferred to partner with their biggest investors. They have started to appear more lately in another sign that the scope for megabuyouts is increasing.</p><p>The Medline deal capped a rapid-fire sales process that kicked off just over two months ago, attracting a field of bidders that's a who's-who of the biggest buyout firms.</p><p>The size was part of the appeal, giving the firms the ability to put large amounts of capital to work without having to worry about competition from strategic bidders because of antitrust concerns.</p><p>In a sign of how hungry the firms were for the deal, executives from the bidders traveled to Medline's suburban-Chicago headquarters to woo members of the founding family.</p>",
