  "title": "World News:  Chinese Factory Activity Slows  ---  Services sector also  took a hit as efforts to  stop Covid outbreaks  kept people at home  ----  By Jonathan Cheng",
  "text": "<p>   BEIJING -- Activity in China's manufacturing and services sectors contracted in March, according to official surveys that offer the first broad glimpse of the economic cost of efforts to contain the highly transmissible Omicron variant in some of the country's most important industrial hubs. </p><p>   The surveys suggest output in China's powerhouse manufacturing sector shrank in March, as lockdowns hit factories in industrial districts ranging from Changchun in northeastern China to the southern technology hub of Shenzhen. </p><p>   Services-sector activity also tumbled, as Covid-19 and government efforts to smother it kept people away from malls, restaurants and hotels. </p><p>   Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate the regions experiencing the worst Covid-19 outbreaks account for around 30% of China's annual national output, underlining the strain the virus is putting on an economy already grappling with weakening overseas demand for its exports, surging commodity prices as the war in Ukraine roars on, and a homegrown property slump. </p><p>   Darkening the outlook further, the focus of China's efforts to combat the virus has shifted to Shanghai, China's most populous city, and a financial center that acts as a base for dozens of multinational corporations. </p><p>   Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday reiterated the government's growth target for the year of around 5.5%, a goal many economists say increasingly appears to be out of reach. </p><p>   Economists say the severity of the damage will depend on how strict and how widespread restrictions get to contain the virus under China's zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19. </p><p>   \"They are trying to keep it targeted, but evidently they are having to keep on tightening,\" said Craig Botham, chief China economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics in London. </p><p>   China's official purchasing managers index for the manufacturing sector dropped to 49.5 in March from 50.2 in February, the National Statistics Bureau said Thursday. The result matched the 49.5 median forecasts made by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   A reading below 50 indicates activity is shrinking rather than expanding. March's result followed four straight months of expansion, after last contracting in October when factories were rocked by rising costs and power crunches. </p><p>   Factory production in areas hit by Covid-19 has been suspended or scaled back as lockdowns hit staffing and operations. Foxconn Technology Group, the biggest assembler of Apple Inc. iPhones, in March briefly halted operations at its factory in Shenzhen before slowly bringing it back up to full capacity over the course of almost a week. Tesla Inc. this week hit the pause button on production at its plant in Shanghai as authorities locked down the eastern half of the city to begin mass testing to weed out Covid-19 cases. </p><p>   To be sure, Chinese authorities have taken steps to try to minimize the disruption to industry from the latest round of restrictions, which may have helped stanch the slide in activity, economists say. Ports are still open and, with official encouragement, big employers such as Foxconn have been experimenting with \"closed-loop\" systems that keep staff overnight in dormitories during lockdowns to keep production humming. </p><p>   Yet Thursday's data shows China's manufacturers are facing a worsening international outlook, adding to the headwinds for the economy. A gauge of new export orders fell even further into contractionary territory, sinking to 47.2 in March from February's 49.0. </p><p>   A purchasing managers index for nonmanufacturing sectors, which includes both services and construction activity in China, tumbled to 48.4 in March from 51.6 in February, as Covid restrictions hammered industries that involve close personal contact, such as railway and air transportation, catering and accommodation, the statistics bureau said. </p><p>   One brighter spot was construction, where activity rose in March as the weather improved and companies heeded Beijing's call to expand infrastructure investment. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Bingyan Wang and Grace Zhu contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
