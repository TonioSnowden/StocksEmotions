  "title": "U.S. News: Republican Jewish Group Rebukes Santos --- Influential coalition cites what it calls misrepresentations about his heritage",
  "text": "<p>\"He deceived us and misrepresented his heritage,\" said Matt Brooks, chief executive of the RJC, whose members include big GOP donors. \"In public comments and to us personally he previously claimed to be Jewish. He has begun his tenure in Congress on a very wrong note,\" he said.</p><p>In interviews with the New York Post and radio station WABC on Monday, Mr. Santos said he was Catholic and that he never said he was Jewish. \"Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was 'Jew-ish,'\" the Post reported he said. He continued to maintain that his grandparents were Jewish and fled Europe, based on family stories.</p><p>A transition aide for Mr. Santos didn't respond to a request for comment on the RJC statement.</p><p>\"I am not a fraud. I am not a fake,\" Mr. Santos said on Fox News late Tuesday. \"I remain committed in delivering results for the American people.\"</p><p>Mr. Santos's background has come under an intense spotlight after a New York Times article last week raised questions about the veracity of his resume. In the interviews Monday, he admitted that he lied on the campaign trail about his education and work experience, but said he hasn't committed any crimes and still intends to serve in Congress.</p><p>Mr. Santos said he never graduated from Baruch College, as he had earlier claimed. He also said that he never was an employee of Wall Street firms Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., as he had previously claimed on his campaign's website.</p><p>Mr. Santos is likely to be seated as a member of Congress on Jan. 3 unless he decides to resign. The Supreme Court has said that the House can only prevent candidates from taking office if they violate the Constitution's age, citizenship and state residency requirements.</p><p>Republican leadership hasn't weighed in on the matter. With the party's victories in the midterm elections, the GOP will have a majority in the House next year and would control decisions regarding any potential investigations. Expulsion from the House is rare, and would require support from two-thirds of House lawmakers.</p><p>Spokespeople for Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California and GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik of New York didn't respond to requests for comment. GOP leadership backed Mr. Santos during his campaign, praising him for bringing diversity to the party, as an openly gay and Jewish Republican.</p><p>Complicating matters is the coming run for House speaker. Republicans are set to have 222 seats, compared with Democrats' 212, with one absence. Mr. McCarthy is running for speaker and can't lose more than four votes, but already five Republicans have said they would oppose his bid, setting up a dramatic tally on Jan 3.</p><p>The resume fabrications have opened Mr. Santos up to attacks from Democrats who are eager for a rematch in the race, which they see as a potential pickup. The seat was previously held by Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi, who left office to unsuccessfully run for governor.</p><p>\"All of Mr. Santos's disclosures, which are inconsistent with his recent statements, must be thoroughly investigated,\" New York Rep.-elect Dan Goldman, a Democrat, said in a statement on Tuesday.</p><p>Republican Rep.-elect Nick LaLota, who will represent a Long Island district, called for an investigation into Mr. Santos by the House Ethics Committee and potentially law enforcement. \"New Yorkers deserve the truth and House Republicans deserve an opportunity to govern without this distraction,\" he said.</p><p>Another GOP congressman-elect representing a nearby district, Anthony D'Esposito, said Long Island residents are \"deeply hurt and rightly offended by the lies and misstatements\" made by Mr. Santos. He called on him to \"operate in a transparent and truthful manner.\"</p><p>Mr. Santos defeated Robert Zimmerman, a Democratic National Committee member, by 8 percentage points in a district that includes parts of northeastern Queens and the North Shore of Long Island.</p><p>Campaign finance forms show Mr. Santos amassing wealth in the period between his unsuccessful 2020 bid for Congress and his 2022 bid. Democrats say his finances should be scrutinized as well.</p><p>In the 2020 campaign, Mr. Santos declared no major assets and listed a commission bonus from LinkBridge Investors as the only compensation over $5,000, according to a filing with the House Clerk.</p><p>Two years later, his disclosure filing said he was managing principal of the Devolder Organization, which is described as a consulting company. He claimed a $750,000 salary and assets including an apartment in Rio de Janeiro valued at up to $1 million and checking and savings accounts totaling at least $1.1 million. He listed income earned from salary and dividends from the Devolder Organization of at least $3.5 million in 2021 and 2022.</p><p>On the disclosure forms, he signed statements saying the records were \"true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\"</p><p>\"I started making a lot of money and I fundamentally started building wealth and I decided I would invest in my own race,\" Mr. Santos said in an interview with New York-based City &amp; State. \"There's nothing wrong with that, no criminal conduct of any sort.\"</p>",
