  "title": "Miami's Wynwood Neighborhood Is Going Vertical; Warehouse and arts district confronts possible overbuilding, other growing pains as office and apartment buildings proliferate",
  "text": "<p>Demand for Wynwood apartments is particularly keen among the large number of people who have resettled in South Florida during the pandemic from the Northeast, Midwest and West Coast. For example, Mark Blatnik said he moved there in 2021 from Chicago because \"Miami was handling the pandemic the opposite way than the city of Chicago was.\" </p><p>Wynwood's recent development surge was made possible by a zoning-law change that allowed for increased density and height.

Like many neighborhood residents, Mr. Blatnik also chose Wynwood for its good restaurants and \"edgy and cool energy,\" he said.</p><p>Wynwood's new office projects are also enjoying strong demand thanks partly to a migration of businesses to Florida from high-tax states like New York and California. Today the neighborhood has 1.3 million square feet of office space, up 30.3% over the past year alone. An additional 233,000 square feet of office space is under development, according to CoStar Group.</p><p>Tenants that have moved into Wynwood include large tech and venture companies such as Founders Fund, Spotify Technology SA, and Blockchain.com. PricewaterhouseCoopers recently signed a lease at 545 Wyn, a 10-floor office tower clad in glass that was completed in 2020 by Chicago developer Sterling Bay.</p><p>Other large developer newcomers who are building in the neighborhood include Kushner Cos. and CIM Group. \"Two, three years ago it was a market that didn't exist, and now top accounting, top consulting, and big tech are all considering it,\" said Grant Killingsworth, a senior vice president with real-estate firm CBRE Group Inc. in Miami.</p><p>Still, demand might not be keeping up with Wynwood's rapid growth, according to some real-estate investors, such as Barry Sternlicht, chief executive of Starwood Capital Group. \"There's probably too many projects on the drawing board,\" said Mr. Sternlicht, who worries that inflation and the shaky economy may put a damper on demand. \"I see a crane in every block of Wynwood. It scares the living daylight out of me.\"</p><p>Wynwood's apartment absorption rate, which measures how quickly apartments are leased, is eight times higher than Chicago's and nine times higher than New York City's, according to CoStar.</p><p>But Wynwood's office vacancy rates are hovering around 35% at the moment, according to CoStar, partly because of the large amount of new space that has recently hit the market. The real-estate brokerage firm JLL projects vacancy rates in Wynwood's office market will drop below 15% within the next six to nine months as new-to-market tenants occupy their space.</p><p>Wynwood residents also are dealing with growing pains as the expanding neighborhood goes upscale. Many of the apartment building residents complain about the noise coming from the bars, restaurants and other entertainment venues. </p><p>Cerveceria La Tropical is among the bars, restaurants and entertainment venues opening in Wynwood as the neighborhood goes upscale.

For example, Wynwood 25, one of the first residential developments, has a mural painted by the artist Miles MacGregor, also known as El Mac, of three adolescent children, which spans multiple levels of the building.</p><p>In 2009 New York developer Tony Goldman, a Wynwood pioneer, invited internationally renowned street artists to paint on the walls of abandoned warehouses. That year he developed Wynwood Walls, an open-air mural museum that centers the neighborhood.</p><p>But today preserving the neighborhood's artistic vibe is becoming more expensive, says Jessica Goldman Srebnick, co-chairwoman of Goldman Properties and daughter of Tony Goldman. \"The cost of construction is going so high, we do have a concern that some developers who have bought land at high prices may try to cut art from the budget or not make the architecture as interesting,\" she said.</p><p>More Property Reports</p><p>* Affordable-Housing Projects Derailed as Developers Struggle for Financing (Sept. 3)</p><p>* Commercial-Property Funds for Small Investors Face Tougher Regulation (Aug. 30)</p><p>* Greece's Largest Shopping Mall to Rise Near Athens (Aug. 30)</p><p>In the mid-to-late 1900s, Wynwood was known as Miami's discount garment district. At the time, many of the retailers were using hand-painted signage and graphics to advertise their businesses.</p><p>As clothing manufacturing moved overseas, some of the abandoned warehouses began filling with graffiti, and in the early 2000s, the neighborhood started to evolve as a gritty, open-air mural space and nightlife destination.</p><p>The recent explosion in development in Wynwood was made possible by a change in zoning laws that allowed for increased density and height. \"People wanted to work here and live here and zoning didn't allow for that,\" said Joe Furst, a developer.</p><p>To help preserve the neighborhood's art-focused identity, the Wynwood Design Review Committee was created by businesses and developers involved in the neighborhood. The group is encouraging developers to incorporate art and creativity into their buildings.</p><p>\"Growth and expansion was a natural next step for Wynwood,\" said Mrs. Goldman Srebnick. \"It's just all happening at once.\"</p><p>Write to Deborah Acosta at deborah.acosta@wsj.com</p><p>Miami's Wynwood Neighborhood Is Going Vertical</p>",
