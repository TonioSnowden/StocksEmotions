Public transport use and job postings are growing, as are bookings for restaurants, while traffic to web conferencing and ecommerce sites has dropped as people return to offices.&#xa0;</p> <p>Economists are in confident mood, with some arguing that the eurozone could be back at pre-pandemic GDP levels by the third quarter of this year.</p> <p>The picture is not uniformly rosy. Nightclubs, shows and theatres remain shut in large parts of Europe while economies such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98fe5478-89fc-44cc-8b61-4630b1e64ddb\">Greece</a> that rely heavily on tourism face labour shortages.&#xa0;</p> <p>Investors, too, are failing to feel the positivity. They remain more concerned at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76921c59-169b-4a51-9e45-550f083f26b3\">inflationary pressures</a> highlighted in the PMI report that showed companies passing on higher input costs to customers “at an unprecedented rate”, a picture replicated in the corresponding <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05e78b35-1186-4858-be3e-88a30e34c6b7\">PMI report for the UK</a>.</p> <p>IHS Markit said eurozone businesses were also dealing with increasing problems in the supply chain and a huge surge in backlogs of work, particularly in the services sector, where they were rising at their fastest rate in more than 20 years.</p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p>More than 5m people became <strong>millionaires</strong> during the pandemic, according to a report by Credit Suisse, illustrating how wealthy households benefited from central banks injecting cheap money into financial markets, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86b99144-ba71-441d-b297-ddcdc94ea7f2\">inflating the price of assets</a>. <strong>House prices</strong>, for example, have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3082fe00-cdb7-4eb9-ab2d-2309b9848114\">hit records in the US and parts of Europe</a>.</p> <p><strong>Argentina</strong>, one of the countries worst hit by coronavirus, is attempting to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79b5fef7-07f3-41a9-ac11-d928735524f0\">export its way out of the crisis</a>. The economy, experiencing inflation of 49 per cent and with IMF negotiations stalled over repayment of a $44bn loan, has spent more time in recession since 1950 than any other country except the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p> <p>The Covid-19 outbreak at the <strong>Chinese port of Shenzhen</strong>, the third-largest terminal in the world, is causing serious delays in international trade and pushing container freight prices to a record high. The problem could intensify if a similar shutdown hit the even bigger port of Shanghai. “The Chinese authorities are attempting to crack down hard on the smallest outbreaks,” said one shipping consultant. “It only takes a few single cases to shut down large areas. We could see much larger impacts.”</p> <h1>Business</h1> <p>The FT revealed that the UK government had instructed<strong> tax authorities</strong> to be lenient with companies struggling with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/552e2f13-c030-481b-af47-4a0772265fb4\">pandemic-related debt</a>. <strong>UK exporters</strong>, meanwhile, received more than $12bn in government aid in the year to March to help them cope with coronavirus and Brexit — the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a983ed6-e0bf-4be0-bb54-d909b20ee1c9\">highest level of support in 30 years.</a> </p> <p><strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> will <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/489422df-6b40-4787-98df-7ac5fd3dee6b\">bar unvaccinated staff and clients</a> from its New York office, the strictest policy yet from a Wall Street bank. Rivals such as Goldman Sachs allow unvaccinated staff as long as they wear masks and practise social distancing. More than 70 per cent of adult New Yorkers have received at least one coronavirus jab. </p> <p>The explosive growth in <strong>online shopping</strong> during the pandemic has brought forward <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c4de3ff-5623-4a31-b6fe-0d4377360c51#post-99c6cfca-0923-4622-bc62-b3df8afde781\">growth in ecommerce by two to three years</a>, according to one of Europe's biggest cardboard box makers. It also means <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ddf26ac-6bf5-4fb0-bdec-8ab70d61197f\">thousands of new warehouses will be needed</a> across the UK and Europe. </p> <h1>&#xa0;Markets</h1> <p>Senior officials at the <strong>US Federal Reserve </strong>have been trying to reassure investors spooked by the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf74366e-c5a1-4213-acbc-50575a4273c8\">interest rates rising earlier than expected</a>. Fed chair Jay Powell led the new dovish tone, telling Congress: “We will not raise interest rates pre-emptively because we think employment is too high [or] because we fear the possible onset of inflation. Instead, we will wait for actual evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances.”</p> <p>The possibility of a rise in US interest rates has knocked <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/525c48c6-d005-495f-add5-bfe41219af77\">investor enthusiasm for gold</a>, according to Russia's <strong>Nordgold</strong>, which pulled its planned listing in London. Since the Fed's comments last week, shares in gold miners, as measured by the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs index, have fallen 9 per cent. </p> <p>Bob Prince at <strong>Bridgewater Associates</strong>, the world's biggest hedge fund, told the FT he did not expect a repeat of 1970s-style inflation, joining more than 70 per cent of fund managers in a recent survey who believe<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/717204fa-45e0-4b11-94c2-cf50b8aacbc0\"> current rises will prove to be transitory</a>. </p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p>Metal Guru comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/498e3bd4-6cc0-4e78-b73a-a120400e0e21?commentID=97e9e987-0fc0-4bc9-82d8-ba95e1ca55b5\">Amazon and PwC take to the trenches in the talent wars</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>I suspect another consequence of lockdown is that staff turnover is now rising very fast. Finance will have to adjust to this quite rapidly or suffer growing staff shortages. This is driven, at least in the short term, by considerable savings accumulation and some consequently greater financial flexibility; the leaving of cities for a change of scene and a reappraisal of renting; and the terrible management by most firms of the “always on” Zoom culture which has burnt people out and is making them reappraise how and who they work for. In my daughter's generation (she is in her late twenties) I've not met one person who aspires to work any length of time in a big financial corporation, and if they do so currently, they don't want to stay.</p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p>History, science, economics, tech, sport, food and drink: we've got your holiday reading covered in our bumper <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e62f2e32-4375-4369-a53c-60e10fd0f353\">summer books guide</a>.
