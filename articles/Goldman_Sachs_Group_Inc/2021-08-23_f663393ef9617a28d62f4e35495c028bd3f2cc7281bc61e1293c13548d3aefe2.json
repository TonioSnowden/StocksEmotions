  "text": "<p>I had the privilege of hearing Mr. Woodson and Ms. Swain speak to a racially mixed audience. They noted how much improvement they've experienced in their lifetimes and their optimism for the future. Mr. Woodson characterizes his outlook as \"radical grace,\" encouraging his people to look ahead, not back, and to exercise agency for their personal and family success. \"Things that are all black should not be seen as bad,\" nor should black success depend on \"what white people do or think of us,\" he said. Ms. Swain noted that she was not raised to hate white people but to accept individuals as they come, and judge them likewise. She, too, has no time for self-pity or worrying about what some may think of her.</p><p>Arnold L. Goldman</p><p>Canton, Conn.</p><p>---</p><p>In 1958 I attended my first meeting of the Bronx High School of Science Student Organization, where I was a freshman representative. To a 13-year-old this was solemn business with important upperclassmen in a very academic high school. I don't remember any of the events or people at the meeting with the vivid exception of one student.</p><p>He rode into the room on a tricycle suited for a five-year-old, his skinny knees angled higher than his ears, circling the aisles filled with serious students until they were all rolling with laughter. The teacher laughed as hard as the kids, and I doubt Senior Class Rep. Stokely Carmichael, whose later advocacy of Black Power over integration is cited by Mr. Epstein as a hinge point in civil-rights history, was ever reprimanded. He was one of the most popular kids in school.</p><p>Steven Kron</p><p>Naples, Fla.</p>",
