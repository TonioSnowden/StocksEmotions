  "title": "Credit Suisse's Former Chairman António Horta-Osório Joins Mediobanca as Senior Adviser; Italian bank appointment is the first for the Portuguese banker since resigning from Credit Suisse in January over travel breaches",
  "text": "<p>The incidents dented Mr. Horta-Osório's reputation. He was a star in European finance, having turned around Britain's Lloyds Banking Group PLC in a 10-year run as chief executive before joining Credit Suisse. He worked for Banco Santander SA for years before that and at Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. early in his career. The Portuguese native was granted a British knighthood in June 2021.</p><p>He called for more personal accountability at Credit Suisse, which helped to lead to his departure. A board-commissioned investigation found that he broke Covid-19 quarantine breaches in Switzerland and the U.K., including while watching tennis at Wimbledon with family members in July 2021. Board members were also concerned about his use of a private plane paid for by Credit Suisse to combine personal travel and work trips, The Wall Street Journal reported. A person close to Mr. Horta-Osório said bank rules on use of aircraft weren't broken.</p><p>Mediobanca said Mr. Horta-Osório would help expand client relationships and deal activity across Europe. He will work with its co-heads of corporate and investment banking. The bank is trying to grow from its historic perch serving Italy's powerful families and corporate titans. It has previously said it wants to give more deal advice and raise stock and bonds for companies in target markets such as France and Spain. It is also growing in wealth management.</p><p>Mediobanca was a bedrock in the development of corporate Italy after World War II, with overlapping shareholdings in some of the country's biggest companies. That gave it power in boardrooms and it became known as the pre-eminent host of Italy's so-called salotto buono, where Italy's elite meet privately to thrash out deals.</p><p>Mr. Horta-Osório has a longstanding relationship with Italy's Agnelli family. He previously was a director at Agnelli family holding company EXOR NV, and was on the board of PartnerRe Ltd. until EXOR sold it recently.</p><p>Mediobanca Chief Executive Alberto Nagel said he had known the banker for many years. \"I have always been impressed by his unique experience and distinguished track record in senior executive roles, with an outstanding ability to lead companies through strategic rethinking and gear changes,\" he said.</p><p>Write to Margot Patrick at margot.patrick@wsj.com</p><p>Credit Suisse's Former Chairman António Horta-Osório Joins Mediobanca as Senior Adviser</p>",
