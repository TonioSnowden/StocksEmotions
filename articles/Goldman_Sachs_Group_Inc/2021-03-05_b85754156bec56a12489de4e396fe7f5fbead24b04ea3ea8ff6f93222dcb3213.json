  "text": "<p>A week that began with police raiding the offices of FC Barcelona will end with a change of leadership at the Spanish football club engulfed in crises on and off the pitch.</p> <p>The Catalan institution on Sunday ballots&#xa0;its 140,000-strong membership to elect its next president.</p> <p>Three candidates — former club president Joan Laporta, technology investor Victor Font and lawyer Antoni Freixa — are vying to succeed Josep Maria Bartomeu, who resigned last year after a spectacular falling out with Barcelona's greatest ever player, Lionel Messi.</p> <p>Bartomeu was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14e2cf0b-aa03-453d-9a36-fd0fcfd2bd7f\">arrested </a>alongside the club's chief executive and its top lawyer on Monday. Police are probing a scandal dubbed “Barçagate” — allegations that the club corruptly hired outside groups to defame Bartomeu's adversaries on Facebook.</p> <p>Bartomeu could not be reached for comment but has always denied wrongdoing. The club said it had offered its “full collaboration to the legal and police authorities”. </p> <p>The candidates admit the affair is damaging to the club's image, but speaking to the Financial Times ahead of the vote, discussed how they would solve potentially larger issues: returning Barcelona to profit following the pandemic; tackling a mounting €1.1bn debt pile; and convincing Messi to stay.</p> <p>A further financial blow came on Thursday after Barcelona and three other Spanish clubs were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b6aa26f-f2ac-426f-b218-612f4c21695c\">ordered to pay back millions</a> of euros received in state aid. The EU's highest court declared beneficial tax arrangements they had enjoyed for a quarter of a century were illegal.</p> <p>Laporta, club president from 2003 for seven trophy-laden years, said he would, once again, make Barcelona “a reference [point] in the football world”. Freixa, a former club director, said that “recovering [is] perfectly possible if we take the right sporting decisions”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Font offered the starkest assessment, arguing that years of profligate spending on players, spiralling debt and a coronavirus-induced revenue shortfall of just over €200m last season have created “a perfect storm”.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The old business model of FC Barcelona [has become] obsolete,” he said.</p> <h2>Stalled ambition</h2> <p>Barcelona had been admired across global football as a model of success. Since the turn of the century, its star-studded team has won the Champions League, Europe's top club tournament, four times.&#xa0;</p> <p>All this was achieved under the ownership of members, rather than a wealthy individual or group to fund the team. Instead, Barcelona capitalised on rising media rights contracts and commercial deals, as sponsors sought to be associated with the winning side. </p> <p>In the 2018/19 season, it became the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56582284-33b3-11ea-9703-eea0cae3f0de\">world's highest revenue-generating club</a> with €840.8m — an increase of nearly €500m from a decade earlier.&#xa0;</p> <p>Barcelona's stated ambition was to be the first football club to reach annual revenues of more than €1bn. The pandemic has punctured that notion.&#xa0;</p> <p>Top teams, from England's Manchester United to Italy's Inter Milan, have suffered steep revenue falls with spectators absent from stadiums. But Barcelona has been among those hit hardest, slumping to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c0afaacc-eeb3-48ef-b830-eb5fac0f377f\">€100m pre-tax loss</a> last season.</p> <p>The prospects of quickly turning to growth once fans return are murky. Broadcasters across Europe have signalled they will pull back from paying ever higher sums to screen elite football. The value of players in the $5.6bn transfer market has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b37591b0-4e34-4060-a8f0-cb8f47e22347\">collapsed</a>, as clubs cut spending on squads.</p> <p>This has left Barcelona in a precarious position. Spending came through huge borrowing: the club's total debt has risen above €1.1bn, with creditors including banks, players, tax authorities and rival clubs.&#xa0;The majority of this debt is short term, with repayment due this year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Barcelona's place as a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c58a764-a43f-11e7-9e4f-7f5e6a7c98a2\">cultural institution</a>, generously supported by Catalonia's business class, has led to a belief the club will be bailed out of its financial predicament.&#xa0;</p> <p>“Imagine if [people] said Queen Elizabeth II is going to go bankrupt?” said a top executive at a Spanish bank. “She isn't. Barcelona has intangible assets which will never disappear.” </p> <p>Club executives are in talks with lenders over debt refinancing, but the leadership vacuum has stalled the discussions. “There is plan A, B, C, D,” said a person close to the executive team. “[But] no one wants to make a decision.”</p> <p>When Christian Seifert, chief executive of Germany's Bundesliga football league, attacked plans for a breakaway European “super league”, he singled out clubs like Barcelona for pushing ideas that concentrate wealth among the game's elite without first resolving their own financial problems.</p> <p>“These so-called super clubs are in fact poorly managed, cash-burning machines that were not able, in a decade of incredible growth, to come close to a somehow sustainable business model,” Seifert <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/adc3b1ab-1312-4a7e-9c8e-e738f7c15939\">told</a> the recent FT Business of Football summit.</p> <p>Sunday's election was sparked by the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ea97688-d72f-4fdc-b271-356a8e8f4a37\">resignation</a> of Bartomeu in October. His downfall began a few months earlier, when Messi <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0db86500-2c92-4402-8168-5ca65285a560\">demanded to leave</a> following&#xa0;a humiliating 8-2 defeat in the Champions League quarter-finals against Germany's Bayern Munich. The defeat was the latest in a series of heavy losses in the latter stages of the competition in recent years.</p> <p>Bartomeu blocked the move. Messi, a six-time winner of the Ballon d'Or, the sport's highest individual honour, chose to see out his contract, which runs until June, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2dc0ba7d-2eed-45e3-b02c-86ccb7e8abcc\">rather than begin</a> a legal dispute with the club.&#xa0;</p> <p>Declining to sell came at a price. Spain's El Mundo newspaper cited leaked documents to reveal Messi's four-year contract was worth €555m, including salary and easily achieved performance bonuses that make him among the world's best-paid athletes.&#xa0;</p> <h2>The Messi money machine</h2> <p>Yet, Barcelona's presidential candidates consider him <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5676e20-5c92-47f3-a76c-11f9761121f5\">value for money</a>, vowing to persuade the player to stay at the club — though, perhaps, on reduced terms.&#xa0;</p> <p>Laporta, who has secured more nominations than any other candidate, argued Messi allows the club to generate bigger sponsorship deals and draws high-rolling VIP hospitality guests to matches.</p> <p>“Messi costs 8 per cent of the total income of the club,” he said. “[But] Messi generates around 30 per cent of [that] income.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Font said he would offer the player “a contract for life”. His plan envisages the Argentine taking a pay cut in the coming years, but then being given financial security for decades. The club would benefit from the ongoing association through future marketing deals.</p> <p>While offering paeans to Messi, the candidates had brickbats for the club's former administration.&#xa0;</p> <p>In particular, they argue the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4dbac826-7857-11e7-90c0-90a9d1bc9691\">record €222m fee</a> from selling Brazilian forward Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 was squandered on inadequate replacements — such as midfielder Philippe Coutinho and winger Ousmane Dembélé — acquired on big transfer fees and salaries.</p> <p>In the 2017-18 season, Barcelona's wage bill jumped nearly 50 per cent to about €640m, paying more in player salaries than any club in world football. Its wage bill has remained at similar levels, eating up three-quarters of the club's income.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Game changers</h2> <p>Each of the candidates has suggested they will spend less on players, with a greater reliance on youngsters developed at its famous La Masia academy, from which Messi once graduated.</p> <p>Font said he would bring in Xavi Hernández, a legendary former player and academy alumni, and give him sweeping powers, similar to Manchester United's Sir Alex Ferguson or Arsenal's Arsène Wenger — former managers who coached the first teams but had wide control over sporting matters.</p> <p>Freixa is focused on bolstering the team, seeking to acquire “two or three top players”. This would be funded by spending the proceeds of a proposed deal to sell a stake in Barça Corporate, an entity that contains business such as its merchandising arm and “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/908752aa-3a1b-11e9-b72b-2c7f526ca5d0\">innovation hub</a>”.</p> <p>Laporta pledged to inject liquidity into the club by following the likes of Inter Milan and Tottenham Hotspur to raise cash on the bond markets. “I have enough experience to talk to the banks face to face, to explain the situation, to explain our potential lines of business, our potentialities in terms of sporting success,” he said.</p> <p>But Font insists the club cannot afford to keep increasing its debts to facilitate further spending.&#xa0;Instead, the technology entrepreneur — in a move that Laporta supports — has called for a review of a €1bn plan financed by US investment bank Goldman Sachs to redevelop its 100,000-seater Camp Nou stadium, seeking to reduce the cost of the project.&#xa0;</p> <p>The club's members — each a shareholder and most fervent fans — must decide who can best move on from Barçagate, while retaining Barcelona's place as one of football's financial and sporting champions.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I would like to launch a message of calm,” said frontrunner Laporta. “FC Barcelona has enough assets, has enough resources, in order to reverse this situation.”</p><p>Source: Murad Ahmed, Sports Editor 2021 'FC Barcelona's presidential hopefuls vow to restore finances — and keep Messi' FT.com 5 March.
