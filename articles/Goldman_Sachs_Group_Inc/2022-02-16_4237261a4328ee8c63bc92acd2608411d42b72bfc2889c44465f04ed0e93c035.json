  "title": "Former Goldman Sachs Partner Testifies at 1MDB Trial; Timothy Leissner said he conspired with former banker Roger Ng to bribe government officials, launder billions of dollars to win lucrative deals",
  "text": "<p>But Mr. Leissner said he and Mr. Ng hid from Goldman executives the role of a controversial Malaysian financier in the deal and a scheme to pay bribes to government officials in Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p>\"I knew it was illegal,\" he said. \"I wanted this to be done for Goldman Sachs. I wanted to be a hero at Goldman Sachs.\"</p><p>Mr. Leissner, 52 years old, is the star witness for the prosecution in Mr. Ng's criminal trial, which began Monday.</p><p>Mr. Ng, a former Goldman managing director, and the financier, Jho Low, were charged in 2018 with conspiring to launder money and conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Mr. Ng is the first criminal defendant in the U.S. case to face a jury.</p><p>Mr. Leissner, who is cooperating with the government, previously pleaded guilty to U.S. charges of conspiracy to launder money and violate antibribery laws for his role in the scandal.</p><p>Mr. Leissner said Wednesday he and his family received between $50 million and $60 million in kickbacks as part of the scheme. Federal prosecutors have accused Mr. Ng of receiving $35 million in kickbacks.</p><p>Marc Agnifilo, a lawyer for Mr. Ng, said at the opening of the trial that his client was innocent and pinned the blame on Mr. Leissner, Mr. Ng's former boss, calling him an immoral man who was testifying in hope of getting a reduced sentence.</p><p>The 1MDB scandal was a black eye for Goldman. The bank paid more than $5 billion in penalties to the U.S. and Malaysia and took away compensation from some top executives. It also admitted that a subsidiary broke U.S. corruption laws. Its board called the matter an \"institutional failure.\"</p><p>A spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment.</p><p>Mr. Leissner testified that he and Mr. Ng were close friends at Goldman who spoke about business and their compensation in and outside of the office. Mr. Leissner said in 2008 he learned of Mr. Low, a young businessman who had powerful connections in Malaysia and the Middle East and was making a name for himself on billion-dollar deals. Mr. Ng, a Malaysian national whose work focused on drumming up business in the country, pursued a relationship with Mr. Low, according to Mr. Leissner.</p><p>\"At Goldman Sachs we were tasked with always finding new business opportunities,\" he said.</p><p>After Messrs. Ng and Low became close, the three began discussing deals, including the 1MDB bond offerings, according to Mr. Leissner.</p><p>Messrs. Ng and Leissner hid Mr. Low's involvement from Goldman because of his reputation, Mr. Leissner said. Mr. Low had previously been rejected as a Goldman client after compliance teams raised red flags about the source of his income, according to prosecutors.</p><p>Before the first bond offering, Messrs. Low, Leissner and Ng met in London, where Mr. Low sketched out on a piece of paper the officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi who needed to be bribed, Mr. Leissner testified.</p><p>The list included former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, according to Mr. Leissner. Mr. Razak was later accused of embezzling more than $680 million from the 1MDB fund. He was sentenced in 2020 to 12 years imprisonment after a court in his country found him guilty of abuse of power.</p><p>Mr. Leissner said he wasn't surprised by the need for bribes, saying he believed they were somewhat common in Asia. He was also aware the bribes were illegal, he said, but the deals brought him praise.</p><p>\"They were highlighted at the highest level at Goldman Sachs,\" he said.</p><p>Write to James Fanelli at james.fanelli@wsj.com</p><p>Former Goldman Sachs Partner Testifies at 1MDB Trial</p>",
