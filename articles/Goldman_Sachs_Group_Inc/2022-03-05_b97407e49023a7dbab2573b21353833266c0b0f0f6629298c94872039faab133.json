  "text": "<p>\"The moment of division is now in the past,\" Cone said after the vote tally was announced at U.S. Soccer's annual general meeting in Atlanta. \"We are one federation. We are one team. I promise to be the leader for all U.S. Soccer.\"</p><p>Cordeiro, a former Goldman Sachs executive and longtime U.S. Soccer volunteer, was two years into his term as president in March 2020 when he came under fire for a legal filing by the federation in defense of the lawsuit brought by members of the U.S. women's soccer team. In that filing, the federation argued that the U.S. men's players had a \"higher level of skill\" and carried more responsibility than the women.</p><p>The argument, which the federation later withdrew, spurred outrage among fans and criticism from federation sponsors and prompted Cordeiro's resignation.</p><p>Cone, then a vice president of the organization, took over as president, ascending to the top spot via procedural rules. A former player for the U.S. women's team, Cone was the first female president of U.S. Soccer in its more than century-long history.</p><p>Cone has led U.S. Soccer during the pandemic, which cut into ticket sales and other revenues. She appointed former U.S. attorney Sally Yates to investigate reports of sexual and workplace misconduct in the professional National Women's Soccer League. That investigation is ongoing.</p><p>Recently, Cone presided over a $24 million settlement agreement with the women's national team players suing the federation for pay discrimination. She also announced an eight-year deal with Turner Sports for the English-language rights to broadcast men's and women's national team games.</p><p>The settlement agreement is contingent on U.S. Soccer ratifying new, separate collective bargaining agreements with members of both the women's and men's teams. In January, U.S. Soccer said it would only ratify the women's and the men's contracts if the teams agreed to equalize their payments stemming from prize money from their respective World Cups.</p><p>As of the last tournaments, those prize pools as determined by FIFA were far apart: the Women's World Cup awarded $30 million for all teams and $4 million to the winning federation, while the men's World Cup paid out $400 million for all teams and $38 million to the winner.</p><p>Among Cone's other responsibilities will be overseeing the planning for the 2026 men's World Cup, which the U.S. is hosting with Canada and Mexico.</p><p>Write to Rachel Bachman at Rachel.Bachman@wsj.com</p><p>Cindy Parlow Cone Re-Elected U.S. Soccer President</p>",
