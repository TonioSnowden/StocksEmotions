  "text": "<p>A team of federal prosecutors who specialize in tracing the flow of dirty money will assume new leadership as the Justice Department ramps up its efforts to police sanctions on Russia and to seize assets held by Russian oligarchs.</p><p>The Justice Department on Tuesday named two veteran prosecutors to lead its money-laundering and asset-recovery section. The section has become an increasingly important player amid the Biden administration's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Brent Wible, a veteran federal prosecutor whose latest stint at the Justice Department began in May 2020, has been appointed the section's new chief, a Justice Department spokesman said. He succeeds Deborah Connor, who left the department in August after almost seven years leading the money-laundering section.</p><p>Mr. Wible's principal deputy will be Molly Moeser, who has worked in the section since 2013, focusing on cases involving money-laundering failures by financial institutions, the spokesman said.</p><p>The appointments were announced earlier in an internal notice to staff of the Justice Department's criminal division, which houses the money-laundering and asset-recovery section.</p><p>The money-laundering section has long played a supporting role in some of the Justice Department's biggest financial crimes investigations. Members of its team specialize in building cases involving compliance violations by banks, and on legal actions that freeze money or assets which prosecutors believe is linked to criminal activity.</p><p>Those skills have taken on greater weight with the ongoing war in Ukraine and the Biden administration's focus on corruption and kleptocracy. President Biden last year said his administration would make anticorruption a central pillar of his national security agenda, a priority that has since dovetailed with the White House's focus on Russian President Vladimir Putin and his associates.</p><p>The Justice Department earlier this year announced the formation of an interagency task force dedicated to enforcing sanctions and other economic countermeasures imposed on Russia, dubbed Task Force KleptoCapture.</p><p>The money-laundering section's international unit has worked closely with the task force, officials say. The international unit was involved in the seizure of a yacht allegedly owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, which was among the task force's first public actions.</p><p>It also has filed a series of civil forfeiture complaints in Florida and Texas, attempting to seize assets valued at more than $60 million, which prosecutors said were tied to funds embezzled by the oligarchs behind one of Ukraine's largest banks.</p><p>In previous years, the money-laundering section's international unit also played a role in the Justice Department's sprawling investigation into Malaysia development bank 1Malaysia Development Bhd, also known as 1MDB. The section filed lawsuits to recover hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly stolen from the bank and laundered into the U.S. financial system, including through the purchase of high-end real estate in New York and Los Angeles and artworks by Claude Monet and Andy Warhol.</p><p>The investigation also led to penalties against Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which agreed to pay $2.8 billion for fundraising work it did on behalf of 1MDB.</p><p>The settlement with Goldman involved the work of the money-laundering unit's bank integrity unit, which also has been involved in large settlementswith financial institutions such as Credit Suisse Group AG and Western Union Co.</p><p>In many of its cases, prosecutors in the money-laundering section have worked to return the proceeds of alleged crimes to any identifiable victims, which can range from investors to foreign governments. Justice Department leaders have said the agency intends to pay closer attention to victims' rights when resolving cases of corporate crime.</p><p>Write to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com</p><p>Justice Department Money-Laundering Team Names Leaders as Ukraine War Raises Its Profile</p>",
