  "text": "<p><strong>One scoop to start: </strong>Credit Suisse is preparing its first insurance claims on losses stemming from its $10bn of funds tied to collapsed finance group Greensill Capital, sources <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0cb03387-9b16-4fd7-a997-6f34d4c4658a\">told</a> the FT's Owen Walker and Ian Smith.</p> <h2>Hindenburg launches yet another Spac attack</h2> <p>While most short sellers are reeling from a painful decade of soaring stock prices and the recently formed Reddit trading army, <strong>Hindenburg Research</strong> has carved out its own niche.&#xa0;</p> <p>The swashbuckling short seller led by <strong>Nate Anderson </strong>has laid waste to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/special-purpose-acquisition-companies\">Spac</a> industry by targeting some of its most celebrated companies. Its latest report takes aim at <strong>DraftKings</strong>, the golden goose of the blank-cheque boom.</p> <p>Hindenburg released a <a href=\"https://hindenburgresearch.com/draftkings/\">report</a> on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb109961-731f-4b3c-ac6c-460b056f2a0a\">claiming</a> the bookmaker's technology subsidiary <strong>SBTech</strong> gleans as much as half of its revenues from illegal gambling markets. Shares of DraftKings fell by more than 7 per cent following the report's publication.</p> <p>The New York-based firm also pointed to the fact that company insiders had benefited from the huge increase in DraftKings' share price — which peaked at $74, more than seven times the $10 price at which Spacs commonly list — by selling a combined $1.4bn worth of stock.</p> <p>The sports betting platform, whose board includes A-list celebrity advisers like basketball legend <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f1d5ebd-3993-4d04-9f5a-43e1bd00c4e6\"><strong>Michael Jordan</strong></a> and supermodel <strong>Gisele Bündchen</strong>, went public in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07b52936-28e5-4f86-8514-8674ad547717\">highly lucrative</a> three-way Spac deal last April.&#xa0;</p> <p>Its success is widely considered to have helped spawn a surge in the popularity of Spacs that has only recently begun to lose steam.</p> <p>Whether or not Hindenburg's accusations hold any weight is unclear. The firm holds a short position in DraftKings, meaning it stands to profit if the gambling group's stock price takes a dive.&#xa0;</p> <p>In its response to the allegations made by the short seller, DraftKings said that Hindenburg had “an incentive to drive down the share price”, adding that it “conducted a thorough review of [SBTech's] business practices and we were comfortable with the findings”.</p> <p>The sports betting company joins other high-profile start-ups targeted by Hindenburg, including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4fc81eb-ae24-4039-b535-0eb5d119dc84\">electric truckmaker</a> <strong>Nikola</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e3835cd-b445-4a26-b3ec-62ced12536f6\">rival</a> <strong>Lordstown Motors</strong>, both of which listed through Spac deals.</p> <p>Anderson's scepticism is shared by regulators who have started to keep a close eye on Spacs.&#xa0;</p> <p>Whatever the motives of Anderson and his team, Wall Street's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88d7f577-9bfa-4215-b57b-0f8a4da3644a\">dwindling excitement</a> for Spac deals means there's never been a better time to strike.</p> <h2>The hedge fund refashioning risky corporate debt</h2> <p>A quiet corner of financial markets that had worried regulators before the pandemic for sharply increasing issuance of risky corporate debt is back in vogue. And one of Wall Street's hottest hedge funds of the past few years is hoping to capitalise on the new found enthusiasm.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Scott Goodwin</strong> and <strong>Jon Lewinsohn</strong> have had a good run since launching <strong>Diameter Capital </strong>in 2017 and posted returns north of 20 per cent in their main hedge fund last year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c8cdeb2-8098-4cfb-973c-096ef4ff0fe4\">writes</a> the FT's Joe Rennison.</p> <p>Now, they're hoping a $250m seed financing from backers including <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong> and <strong>Corbin Capital </strong>will help them take collateralised loan obligations mainstream.</p> <p>CLOs bundle up loans made to lower-rated companies and use them to back interest payments on a stack of new debt with cascading exposure to the default of the underlying loans.&#xa0;</p> <p>It means risky debt typically bought by specialist investors is re-crafted into higher-rated securities bought by more traditional asset managers (typically at a lower risk).&#xa0;</p> <p>These managers get comfortable investing in the CLO because they are insulated by a smaller group of investors willing to bear the brunt of the losses should companies renege on their loans (in exchange for the potential of much higher returns).</p> <p>Regulators had become concerned before the pandemic that CLO managers hungry for new loans to package up had spurred a degradation in underwriting standards in the leveraged loan market that could exacerbate a credit crisis if the economy faltered.&#xa0;</p> <p>But over a year on from the worst of the coronavirus induced sell-off, CLO managers feel vindicated after the market survived largely intact, even if it was helped along the way by record intervention in credit markets by the<strong> Federal Reserve</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The Fed had provided a new lease of life to the market, with investors drawn to the potential for higher returns in an otherwise low-yielding world.</p> <p>Managers are responding by seeking out funding sources for a number of new deals, rather than raising new capital for each new CLO, as was once more common.&#xa0;</p> <p>Diameter intends to use the money it has raised to issue six CLOs, building on a partnership made after Apollo supported Diameter's move into the similar market for collateralised debt obligations.&#xa0;</p> <p>It will also look to build on Goodwin's long-held relationship with his first boss when he worked at <strong>Citigroup</strong>, and now Apollo co-president <strong>Jim Zelter</strong>.</p> <h2>Activists face the music in the battle against Vincent Bolloré</h2> <p>French media conglomerate <strong>Vivendi</strong>'s proposed spin off of <strong>Universal Music Group</strong> is set to be the event of the season.</p> <p>The deal features a <em>crème de la crème</em> cast of characters from Vivendi's billionaire controlling shareholder <strong>Vincent Bolloré</strong> to the hedge fund tycoon <strong>Bill Ackman</strong>, whose blank-cheque company <strong>Pershing Square Tontine Holdings</strong> is in talks to buy a 10 per cent stake in the record label behind artists such as <strong>Lady Gaga </strong>and <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>. (It's a complicated deal — DD breaks it down in detail <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0c356c4-c60f-4dcb-b642-9386003c1615\">here</a>.)</p> <p>But there will be some uninvited guests, too.</p> <p><strong>Third Point</strong>, the New York activist investor run by<strong> Dan Loeb</strong>, has built a “significant” stake in Vivendi, as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a2a7df40-68b4-4041-b2a5-98b967af4e07\">reported</a> by the FT's Leila Abboud and DD's Ortenca Aliaj. The fund declined to comment on how it planned to use its holding, as the June 22 Vivendi shareholders' vote looms.</p> <p>Meanwhile, shareholders including little-known hedge funds <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eabf7d93-32fe-42cd-a0ac-71665380a0a4\"><strong>Bluebell Capital</strong></a> and <strong>Artisan Partners </strong>have come out against the Ackman deal. If Loeb opts to side with his fellow activists, it could turn into a face-off between two titans of the investing world.</p> <p>But as Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51d945cf-28b9-4d93-9dfb-f602271ef9c1\">points out</a>, the odds aren't in Bluebell and Artisan's favour. Vivendi only needs a 50 per cent majority to approve the spin-off, and Bolloré's holding company already owns nearly 30 per cent of the vote.&#xa0;</p> <p>Rebellious minority shareholders would need more than just Loeb in their corner. And even that is uncertain.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>US president <strong>Joe Biden </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bee1b959-b2aa-4ee1-8391-d5b5832ededd\">has appointed</a> legal scholar <strong>Lina Khan</strong>, a prominent critic of the power of large technology companies, to chair the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong>. This comes on the same day that she was confirmed by the US Senate <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c297564c-85fc-4235-9444-895609c06c38\">for a seat</a> on the five-member commission. Also, read Lex's take <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/de9787c3-92a5-4de4-8700-90cd1cac6c0c\">here</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>US Securities and Exchange Commission </strong>has appointed <strong>Hill &amp; Barlow</strong> alum <strong>Renee Jones</strong> as director of its corporation finance division and her predecessor, <strong>John Coates</strong>, as the regulator's general counsel.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Saudi Arabia's<strong> Public Investment Fund</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pif.gov.sa/en/MediaCenter/Pages/NewsDetails.aspx?NewsID=72\">has made three senior hires</a> including <strong>Eyas AlDossari</strong>, who joins from <strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>in<strong> Saudi Arabia</strong>, where he was a managing director and head of investment banking.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Rothschild</strong> has hired London-based<strong> Goldman Sachs</strong> banker <strong>John Brennan</strong>, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter and as first reported by Financial News. Brennan was only recently named a partner at Goldman where he worked in its financial institutions group.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>MUFG</strong> has appointed veteran <strong>Randall Chafetz</strong> to the newly created role of vice-chair of its global corporate and investment banking business, based in New York. He has been with the group since 1998, when he joined what was then the <strong>Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi</strong> as head of capital markets ahead of its 2006 merger with<strong> UFJ Bank</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Davis Polk</strong> has hired <strong>Paul Marquardt</strong> as a partner in the law firm's financial institutions group in Washington DC. Marquardt joins from <strong>Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton</strong>, where he led the foreign investment and national security practice.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Climbing the ladder </strong>Ted Pick was the last person hired in his analyst class at Morgan Stanley more than 30 years ago. Today, he's leading the bank's charge against Goldman Sachs — and winning. The next phase in his unlikely ascent could likely be as chief executive.
