  "text": "<p>   Regarding Charles A. Donovan and Robert G. Marshall's op-ed \"Margaret Sanger Was a Eugenicist to the End\" (April 22): Planned Parenthood's past support of eugenics is abominable, but there is a world of difference between having the government decide who can be a parent and those parents choosing for themselves. </p><p>   There are people for whom having a child with a major disability has been a gift, but there are also parents who have ended up divorced and exhausted, with no options to give them some relief from the 24-hour needs of some children, and no idea what will happen when they, the parents, die. Maybe Messrs. Donovan and Marshall can focus on creating these badly needed and expensive services before they dictate to women and men, rather like Sanger herself did. </p><p>   Laurie Goldman </p><p>   Birmingham, Mich. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   There is a simple intellectual exercise one can perform with those who embrace what Messrs. Donovan and Marshall correctly term \"eugenic abortion.\" Point out that the motive behind such abortions is the sentiment: \"It is better not to be born than to be born with X,\" where \"X\" is a medical condition. Then mention that birth is of no ultimate significance except as the portal to life. </p><p>   It is logically impossible to say \"it is better not to be born than to be born with X\" without also implying \"it is better not to live than to live with X.\" If you support eugenic abortion, you must, as a matter of rational continuity, support euthanasia for all living persons suffering from \"X\" -- a repugnant position. </p><p>   Thomas Anthony DiMaggio </p><p>   York, Pa. </p><p></p>",
