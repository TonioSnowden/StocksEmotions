  "text": "<p>   Former CNN President Jeff Zucker is in talks with private-equity firm RedBird Capital Partners to run a roughly $1 billion fund investing in sports and media, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The move would mark Mr. Zucker's return to the business world since he resigned from CNN in February after he failed to disclose a consensual relationship with a colleague. </p><p>   While Mr. Zucker is known as a news executive -- having run CNN for nine years -- he oversaw WarnerMedia's sports properties, which included Turner's deal with the National Basketball Association. Before he joined CNN, he was chief executive of NBCUniversal. </p><p>   RedBird, founded in 2014 by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Gerry Cardinale, specializes in sports- and media-related investments. The firm, which manages about $7 billion in assets, according to its website, owns a minority stake in Fenway Sports Group, the owner of the Boston Red Sox and the Liverpool Football Club. Last year, RedBird led an investor group to take a stake in LeBron James's entertainment company, SpringHill Co. </p><p>   In 2020, the firm announced an investment in Skydance Media, the entertainment company started by film producer David Ellison. RedBird in 2019 teamed up with the players associations for Major League Baseball and the National Football League to form athlete-licensing and marketing company OneTeam Partners LLC. </p><p>   The discussions between Mr. Zucker and RedBird are continuing and no deal has been signed. </p><p></p>",
