The video will be a crucial part of the prosecution case.</p> <p>“You can believe your eyes,” he said. “It's homicide. It's murder.”</p> <p>But the defence for the former police officer zoomed out on a sweeping investigation with almost 50,000 pieces of evidence, raising questions about the cause of Floyd's death and what constituted reasonable use of force.</p> <p>“Derek Chauvin did exactly what he had been trained to do over his 19-year career. The use of force is not attractive, but it is a necessary component of policing,” said defence attorney Eric Nelson.</p> <p>Both attorneys underlined that, despite <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fae8105a-467a-423e-b31c-719e7ec64163\">intense public interest</a>, Chauvin's trial was separate from larger social questions about&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff5245f0-375d-44b8-b9ab-3ded852c341e\">racism and accountability in US policing</a>.</p> <p>Chauvin is charged with second- and third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. He has pleaded not guilty. The case continues.
