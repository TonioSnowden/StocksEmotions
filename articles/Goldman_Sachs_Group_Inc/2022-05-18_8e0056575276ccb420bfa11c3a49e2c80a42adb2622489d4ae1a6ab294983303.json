  "text": "<p>\"Crypto moves in cycles, and we just witnessed a big one,\" he added.</p><p>Mr. Novogratz, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Fortress Investment Group executive, has emerged as one of crypto's most-ardent supporters on Wall Street. He invested heavily in digital assets, and in Galaxy Digital built a business designed to provide many of the financial services to the crypto industry that Goldman and other banks have long performed for companies and professional investors.</p><p>\"I firmly believe now more than ever that the crypto revolution is here to stay,\" he wrote.</p><p>Mr. Novogratz's unbridled enthusiasm for crypto's future has stood in stark relief to many other veteran financiers and made him a cult figure of sorts in a world that has captivated millions.</p><p>That community is now facing a crisis in confidence, after the recent collapse of TerraUSD, or UST, and sister stablecoin Luna deepened losses across many popular digital assets. Galaxy has been an investor in Luna, and in January Mr. Novogratz had tweeted a photo of his new tattoo: a wolf howling at a yellow moon. \"I'm officially a Lunatic!!!\" he wrote.</p><p>Stablecoins like TerraUSD are tied to the value of government-issued currencies, including the U.S. dollar. Earlier this month, though, a large block of transactions pushed TerraUSD below its $1 peg. Luna tumbled, too. Investors have continued to unload both currencies.</p><p>\"The macro backdrop put pressure on Luna and the reserves held to back UST,\" he wrote. \"The downward pressure on reserve assets, coupled with UST withdrawals, triggered a stress scenario akin to a `run on the bank.'\"</p><p>In his letter, Mr. Novogratz wrote that Galaxy had invested in Luna in late 2020. Since then, he said, the firm followed the core tenets of good investing: \"keep a diversified portfolio, take profits along the way, have a risk-management framework,\" and \"understand that all investments happen in a macro framework.\"</p><p>Mr. Novogratz didn't say in his letter whether Galaxy lost money on its Luna investment or by how much it had reduced its stake, or if he incurred any personal losses during the selloff.</p><p>Galaxy owned about $400 million in Luna as of December. Earlier this month, Galaxy reported that sales of Luna were the biggest contributor to the $355 million in net realized gains on digital assets it recorded during the first quarter.</p><p>\"With hindsight things always look clearer,\" Mr. Novogratz wrote. \"My tattoo will be a constant reminder that venture investing requires humility.\"</p><p>Write to Justin Baer at justin.baer@wsj.com</p><p>Galaxy's Mike Novogratz Says 'Crypto Revolution Is Here to Stay' Despite Selloff</p>",
