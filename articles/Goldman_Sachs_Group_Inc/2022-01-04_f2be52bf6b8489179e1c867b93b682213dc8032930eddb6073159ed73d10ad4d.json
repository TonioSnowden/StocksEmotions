  "text": "<p>I can understand the rationale. The consolidation of data would avoid the duplication of services, which could bring astronomical savings. But let us not forget the patient. The number of hours in the day is unchanged and the additional computer tasks extract time from the doctor-patient encounter. Many physicians are resigned to entering data using computer tablets during the patient encounter, and avoiding eye contact. It's very easy for the patient to feel distant and ignored, leading to further erosion of the doctor-patient relationship.</p><p>This is the medical equivalent of texting while driving. It may not be long before we realize the extent of its effect on patient care.</p><p>Ronald Frank, M.D.</p><p>West Orange, N.J.</p><p>I am one of those independent private practitioners mentioned in Ms. Goldman's article who will be shutting down my practice. For 30 years, I accepted all insurances, saw patients the same day if need be, treated some for free and personally kept aware of every aspect of their care. But Medicare threatens me with 9% cuts for not compiling data for the system, the insurers hire private companies to demand refunds on payments they made to me years ago, and I recently received a check for $280 for performing a difficult cataract surgery. This amount barely covers my staff's time to obtain the precertification that insurers demand to do the procedure.</p><p>Meanwhile, when I tried to get an appointment for myself at the healthcare system my insurance demands I use, there was a three-month wait. I don't know for whom to feel more sorryâ€”my patients or myself.</p><p>Marc Rosenblatt, M.D.</p><p>New York</p><p>Many older doctors practice medicine because they enjoy it. But they don't enjoy having to see a certain number of patients an hour, they don't adapt easily to the new system, and when pushed they simply retire. We're losing all that knowledge and experience, right when we boomers are aging and need knowledgeable doctors.</p><p>Also consider what you have to go through to speak to your doctor with these new medical groups. First, you are told to call 911 if it's an emergency. Then, you get a whole speech about Covid. Next, you are told, \"We are experiencing unusually high call volumes,\" and get put on hold. After endless repeated babble and noise that passes for music to some, you finally get the phone tree, and eventually you might even get an operator. All this to ask a question or check an appointment. It's almost not worth it.</p><p>Alan Blum</p><p>Mount Vernon, N.Y.</p><p>Ms. Goldman writes that \"doctors must operate with a clear sense that they are serving the patients in front of them, not the government, data-collection systems, insurance companies or hospital directors.\"</p><p>If only that were true. In any other service-oriented business, the patient would be the customer, able to compare quality and price in a search for value. But it has been the unfortunate reality for many years that the customers of the physician's services are the third-party payers: the government, insurance companies and hospital systems. Unless this changes and the patient can again behave as a customer, both the patient's and the physician's level of satisfaction will continue to decline.</p><p>Daniel Cohen, M.D.</p><p>Yardley, Pa.</p><p>What Ever Happened to 'Patient First'?</p>",
