  "text": "<p>MarketWatch Live: U.S. stocks edge lower at opening bell even as fear over COVID in China attenuates</p><p>Read: It's wishful thinking that stocks will soar before the Fed pivots to lower rates</p><p>Guessing at Fed moves will be among the many tasks and challenges facing investors in 2023, according to the crystal-ball gazing we've seen thus far. Deutsche Bank said Monday that a U.S. recession next year will pummel stocks, though they see a recovery likely by the end of 2023.</p><p>But maybe don't get too carried away by the word recovery. Goldman sees a \"hope\" phase kicking in next year, but the S&amp;P 500 finishing around 4,000, while Morgan Stanley expects a \"terrific\"first quarter buying opportunity, but a finish at 3,900. Both end goal posts are not far off where we are currently.</p><p>Our call of the day comes from Bank of America, which tosses its own forecasts into the ring, as they mix worries with encouragement about keeping an eye on the long-term prize.</p><p>\"Focus on the marathon, not the sprint,\" said a team led by Savita Subramanian, head of U.S. equity &amp; quantitative strategy. Their 2023-end target is also 4,000, with a bear case of 3,000, as they say near-term pain from company earnings should be expected.</p><p>BofA's S&amp;P 500 earnings per share forecast is $200, a number 15% below other Wall Street estimates. And returns ahead of earnings revision troughs have often been \"deeply negative,\" cautions Subramanian.</p><p>\"But the best phase is that which follows — low but rising earnings revisions ratios. The market typically bottoms six months before the end of a recession, so buy in 1H based on our economists forecast of the recession ending by 3Q 2023,\" she said. Their bull case for the S&amp;P 500 is 4,600, based on the contrarian signal of a very bearish Wall Street.</p><p>What to own? While \"2022 was all about the Fed, 2023 is about the real economy. Own quality, income, reshoring, green and brown [renewables and fossil fuels], small-caps,\" is Bofa's key advice. Cyclical factors, such as slower growth, are part of the reason investors need to seek out quality stocks.</p><p>She advises focusing on income and defense, saying if bonds do well, utilities will follow, and have lifted their view on the sector to overweight. Healthcare was cut to marketweight on risk of crowding by investors, while communication services \"appears to be a value trap.\" They cut tech to underweight owing to cyclicality and de-globalization risks.</p><p>The key risks ahead for BofA lie in that old cliché \"it is different this time.\" They see liquidity risk in \"odd places\" — the S&amp;P 500 (\"the most crowded ticker in the world\") and Treasury bonds, unprecedented public sector debt and polarized polities ahead, along with sticky, high inflation. The silver lining to that debt is that companies look far better capitalized than in prior recessions.</p><p>They are also worried about a \"wealth effect on steroids,\" noting that the $22 trillion lost in equities, bonds, cryptocurrency and real estate this year would equal a $700 billion hit to consumption, \"which represents about 4% of total current consumption, plus or minus.\"</p><p>BofA lays out its recession worries, clearly: \"Since COVID idiosyncratic risk in the market has dropped, and average pair-wise stock correlations surged in 2022. The biggest rate shock in history, the most aggressive hiking cycle, the biggest inflationary pressure in 40+ years, rising recession fears, wartime and ongoing geopolitical risks, urgency building around carbon emission reduction suggest macro will loom large in 2023,\" they said.</p><p>The bright side? BofA wants investors to look past the near term and into what could be a much brighter future ahead. \"Our 10-year valuation model suggests that even if you buy today, you will enjoy [roughly] 5% price returns…pushing the S&amp;P 500 to 6,000 by 2,032,\" said Subramanian and the team.</p><p>The markets</p><p>Stocks SPX DJIA COMPare flat in early trade, with bond yields BX:TMUBMUSD02Y BX:TMUBMUSD10Y softer and oil prices CL.1 BRN00 climbing.
