  "text": "<p><strong>Greggs</strong> has raised profit targets after the easing of lockdown restrictions meant sales bounced back to pre-pandemic levels.</p> <p>The bakery chain operator said profits for the year could be materially higher than the board's previous expectation. Despite “considerable uncertainty” around the trading environment for the rest of the year, profits could return to near 2019 levels, it said.</p> <p>For the 8 weeks to May 8, like-for-like sales were just 3.9 per cent below the 2019 rate with delivery continuing to contribute positively to performance, the company said in an unscheduled trading update. </p> <p>There was no update on whether Greggs intends to repay state aid including business rates relief.</p> <p>“The rapid recovery to 2019 revenue levels is clearly encouraging, albeit only bringing forward the bounceback in profitability that had already been anticipated,” said Jefferies analyst Andrew Wade. “More fundamentally, we continue to see&#xa0;Greggs&#xa0;as a long-term structural winner, with multiple proven growth levers and strong brand momentum.”</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>Provident Financial</strong> confirmed it is pulling out of the home credit market and has begun a consultation process for 2,100 employees. The subprime lender, which has faced a barrage of customer complaints, said it had made the decision “in light of the changing industry and regulatory dynamics in the home-credit sector, as well as shifting customer preferences”. Provident posted a £113.5m pre-tax loss for 2020, versus a £119m profit the year before, as losses from its doorstep lending division ballooned to £74.9m. Trends improved for credit card lending and vehicle finance in the first quarter, Provident added. </p> <p><strong>Centrica</strong>, the British Gas owner, said its 2021 outlook remained broadly unchanged from its previous update in February. Covid-19 was continuing to impact operations with electricity demand from business customers down 15 per cent in the first quarter and residential boiler installations 11 per cent lower year on year, it said. The company reported a reduction in net debt to £500m from £3bn at the year end following its sale of Direct Energy but gave no specific guidance on group earnings or cash flow. </p> <p><strong>Victrex</strong>, the polymer maker, said it remains comfortable with current full year expectations. Underlying fiscal half-year profit to March fell 10 per cent to £46.6m on weaker margins, which suffered on the unwind of post-Brexit stockpiling and an all staff bonus programme. </p> <p>Funeral director <strong>Dignity</strong> said underlying operating profit rose 35 per cent to £26.1m in the first quarter, ahead of the board's expectations, after deaths increased year on year by 27 per cent. Funeral market share and average revenue were below the board's expectations, it said. The UK death rate has since fallen below the five-year average, clouding the outlook, while restrictions on funeral sizes continue to impact the average revenue per funeral, it said. </p> <p>Software maker <strong>Marlowe</strong>&#xa0;said its full-year results to March will beat expectations after strong second-half trading. The new financial year has started well, with significant demand experienced across all business units in April, it added.</p> <p><strong>Safestore</strong> revised full-year earnings guidance upwards after posting revenue of £43.7m for the second quarter to April, up 11.2 per cent year on year. The storage facility operator said momentum had improved with UK business accelerating strongly in the quarter.</p> <p><strong>Gem Diamonds</strong> reported the find of a 370 carat&#xa0;white diamond at the Letseng mine in Lesotho, South Africa, its second notable find of May so far. </p> <p><strong>ADVFN</strong> said in a trading update that it expects a pre-tax profit for the year ending June to be in excess of £1m. The data provider for retail investors said it expected current momentum to be reflected in improving results and continuing growth.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p>The US government <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b8b530c7-f194-43da-8c98-6e181f68da38\">enacted emergency powers</a> on Sunday in a bid to keep fuel supply lines open as fears of shortages rose following the shutdown of an essential pipeline due to a cyber attack. The <strong>Colonial Pipeline Company</strong>, which operates the pipeline, said on Sunday that the network remained offline and gave no indication of when full service would resume. The pipeline transports 2.5m barrels of fuel a day from refineries on the Gulf Coast to markets such as Atlanta, Washington and New York.</p> <p>A transatlantic rift has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/547a4dc2-e11b-4e8f-b526-cbf135ba7b4d\">opened up in banking</a> over the merits of bringing employees back to the office quickly. <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> and <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> have summoned all US staff back to their offices as soon as next month. By contrast, European banks from London-based <strong>HSBC</strong> to France's <strong>Société Générale</strong> are returning to the office more cautiously and with a more relaxed attitude to flexible working.</p> <p><strong>Executive bonuses</strong> in the US have received <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/50e73d21-3de5-4196-b124-7281ec7af828\">record low support</a> from investors this year after boardroom moves to loosen performance targets during the pandemic backfired.&#xa0;So far in 2021, shareholder support for US executive bonuses is at its lowest since 2011 when “say on pay” votes were made mandatory, according to Equilar, a pay data company.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Sebastian Mallaby</strong> <br>After a quarter of a century in which core inflation, excluding volatile food and energy, has tended to undershoot the Fed's 2 per cent target, prices now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0fd9d91-350b-4ad7-b50e-433410f7885d\">threaten to rise faster than desired</a> and the risks are significant.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Hill</strong> <br>The <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b0dcaf74-9428-4f64-84f2-41b001e1e311\">central paradox</a> of planning for a post-pandemic return to the office is that the best way of encouraging people back may be to give them the freedom not to. </p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
