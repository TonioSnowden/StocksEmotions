  "title": "Goldman to acquire robo-adviser NextCapital in latest push to diversify",
  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs is buying NextCapital, a robo-adviser that specialises in workplace pensions, as part of chief executive David Solomon's push into businesses with steadier income streams including asset and wealth management. </p> <p>Chicago-based NextCapital directly advises retirement plans as well as supplying its underlying technology to other financial institutions under a “white label”. &#xa0;Sponsors of defined contribution retirement plans use NextCapital's digital advice to help employees customise their savings and investment options.</p> <p>Goldman declined to disclose the price of the acquisition but said it would be among its five largest asset management deals. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management is already one of the world's biggest providers of “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe5706bc-840d-4e99-a8dd-bb98bc0fa6b5\">outsourced chief investment officer</a>” services to pension plans, insurers and other asset managers. It has $350bn in pension plan assets under supervision.</p> <p>“This is a bid to provide all of corporate America with a better solution to help their employees plan for retirement,” said Luke Sarsfield, Goldman's co-head of asset management.</p> <p>Dealmaking in the asset management industry <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d38b100-07de-400e-95b4-3199837ea044\">has boomed</a> amid shrinking margins, the growing dominance of the largest companies and the rise of artificial intelligence-based players. Mid-sized and smaller managers have come under pressure to consolidate or sell to bigger competitors. </p> <p>More than 1,200 transactions involving asset managers took place in 2021, a record, with $69bn worth deals agreed, the second-highest dollar amount in history, according to Refinitiv data. Last year, Morgan Stanley <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/635db026-2e71-4b39-b703-c7233074c84b\">completed its acquisition</a> of Eaton Vance for $7bn after beating JPMorgan Chase in a competitive bidding war, while T Rowe Price <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9afafee6-d093-4087-b6cb-966fb978c183\">bought credit manage</a>r Oak Hill Advisors for up to $4.2bn.</p> <p>Almost $11bn worth of M&amp;A activity has occurred in the sector in 2022, above the historical average, though deal activity more broadly has slowed since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. </p> <p>For Goldman, the deal underscored Solomon's efforts to appeal to investors that have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4cc9e592-0b69-4b80-a114-e8db63a4f90b\">valued the bank's stock</a> below its Wall Street peers because they perceive its earnings to be more volatile. Solomon is seeking to expand Goldman's operations in areas with recurring revenue such as asset management, consumer and transaction banking. </p> <p>“This acquisition furthers our strategic objective of building compelling client solutions in asset management and accelerating our investment in technology to serve the growing defined contribution market,” Solomon said in a statement.</p> <p>Goldman last month set a target for its asset and wealth management divisions to generate more than $10bn in fee-based income by 2024, up from $7.57bn in 2021, when it accounted for about 13 per cent of the bank's overall revenue. Goldman's asset management unit last year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd064398-2030-4260-84e3-f442d42cd2d1\">agreed to buy</a> the investment management arm of Dutch insurer NN Group for about €1.6bn.</p> <p>“Banking organisations have long been buyers of asset management businesses for a variety of reasons, including that they are a good source of non-interest fee income, which has been particularly important during the low interest rate environment that has persisted since the financial crisis,” said Andrew Gerlach, a partner in the financial services department of law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.</p> <p>“These businesses do not require a lot of capital for banks relative to other bank products,” he added. </p> <p>Sarsfield said Goldman had opted to buy NextCapital rather than develop its own robo-advisers for pensions because they had already worked together successfully. “There is a certain benefit to being among the early movers . . . This is a company that we've known and admired for a long time.”</p> <p>Founded in 2014, NextCapital last raised outside funds in 2020, when it received a $30mn injection led by FP Credit, the credit investment arm of Francisco Partners.</p> <p>While a number of big asset managers offer robo-advisers to retail clients, NextCapital is unusual in that it provides services within 401(k) plans. </p> <p>It also stands out for the level of personalisation it offers. In addition to tailoring its advice to the age and circumstances of the customer, it also takes account of goals such as saving for a child's college education and retirement.</p><p>Source: Brooke Masters, Joshua Franklin and James Fontanella-Khan in New York 2022 'Goldman to acquire robo-adviser NextCapital in latest push to diversify' FT.com 29 March.
