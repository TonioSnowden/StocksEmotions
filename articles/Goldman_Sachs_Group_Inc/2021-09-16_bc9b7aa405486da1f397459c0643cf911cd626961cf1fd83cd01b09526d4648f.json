  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Lexington Weighs  Selling Its Business  ----  By Miriam Gottfried and Cara Lombardo",
  "text": "<p>   Investment firm Lexington Partners LP is exploring a sale of its business, part of an increasingly popular niche of the red-hot private-equity industry, said people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Closely held Lexington, which specializes in buying secondhand stakes in private-equity funds, has hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to advise on a potential sale, which could value the firm at a few billion dollars, some of the people said. </p><p>   Among the interested bidders are large private-equity firms including KKR &amp; Co., the people said. </p><p>   The process is still at an early stage, and there is a chance a deal won't happen. </p><p>   With seven offices around the world and more than $55 billion in committed capital since its inception, Lexington is one of the largest independent players in the burgeoning field known as private-equity secondaries. </p><p>   Private-equity funds typically have a lifespan of around 10 years, and investors such as pension and sovereign-wealth funds have struggled to cash out before then. Such investors might want out for a variety of reasons, including a shift in strategy or a need to free up cash. </p><p>   The rise of the market for secondaries has made private equity a more liquid asset class, with firms such as Lexington, Paris-based Ardian and the Strategic Partners unit of Blackstone Inc. raising billions of dollars to purchase stakes in existing buyout funds from other investors. </p><p>   Some firms have also launched secondaries businesses dedicated to real estate and credit investments. </p><p>   Some $196.9 billion in assets globally were dedicated to investing in private-equity secondaries as of year-end 2020, according to Preqin, up from $21.6 billion in 2016. The growth comes against the backdrop of huge fundraising hauls and a wave of buyout activity by private-equity firms, as their yield-hungry investors put more money into the asset class while interest rates have remained low. Shares of publicly traded private-equity firms have soared. </p><p></p>",
