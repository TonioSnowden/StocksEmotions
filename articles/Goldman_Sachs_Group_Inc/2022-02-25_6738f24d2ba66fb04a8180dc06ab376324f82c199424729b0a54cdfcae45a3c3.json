  "title": "VW to offer only non-voting shares to public in €20bn Porsche listing",
  "text": "<p>Volkswagen's planned Porsche float will only offer non-voting shares to the public in a move that threatens to cast a pall over what could become one of Germany's largest listings, fetching an estimated €20bn.</p> <p>The German carmaker confirmed it had “concluded a framework agreement” that creates two share classes and mirrors the company's own much-criticised corporate governance structure.</p> <p>The deal with its largest shareholder, the investment vehicle of the Porsche-Piëch family, will involve floating just 12.5 per cent of the storied sports car brand on the open market, leaving the two companies in control.</p> <p>The partial initial public offering could take place as early as October, Wolfsburg-based VW added.</p> <p>Arno Antlitz, VW's chief financial officer, called the plan a “win-win situation for all our stakeholders”, referring to VW's powerful German works council and the company's lead shareholders, which include the Porsche-Piëch families and the German state of Lower Saxony.</p> <p>Chief executive Herbert Diess said the move would give Porsche, which accounts for roughly a quarter of VW's annual profits and has made inroads into the electric market, greater “entrepreneurial freedom”.</p> <p>The proceeds from an IPO would give VW “additional flexibility to further accelerate the transformation” to electric vehicles, he told analysts.</p> <p>Under current plans, Porsche's share capital would be split in half, creating two classes — ordinary voting shares and non-voting preference shares.</p> <p>The Porsche-Piëch family's investment vehicle would then buy just over 25 per cent of the voting shares at a 7.5 per cent premium on the flotation price, regaining a direct hold over the historic heirloom, which the family was forced to cede to VW in 2012 after a failed takeover attempt following the financial crisis.</p> <p>A further 25 per cent of the non-voting preference shares will be offered to the market, and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, a current VW shareholder, aims to “become a strategic investor in Porsche AG's preferred shares as a natural expansion of the existing relationship”, the company said.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs advised on the structure of the transaction, Antlitz added.</p> <p>Despite the narrow free float, VW looks set to raise at least €20bn from the IPO on a valuation of about €90bn for Porsche as a whole. This sum would eclipse some of the largest public offerings in recent years, including electric carmaker Rivian's $12bn Nasdaq debut in 2021.</p> <p>Given its consistently high profit margins, “the appeal of owning a direct stake in Porsche almost guarantees success”, said Philippe Houchois, an auto analyst at Jefferies. “But the preliminary terms still subject to approval by VW and [Porsche SE] boards raise governance concerns.”</p> <p>VW said it intended to use 49 per cent of its proceeds on a special dividend, much of which would help fund Porsche SE's purchase of ordinary Porsche voting shares.</p> <p>The company said it would also distribute a one-off €2,000 bonus to roughly 130,000 German employees, placating unions that in effect control the company's supervisory board.</p> <p>The remaining proceeds could be used to fund some of VW's six planned battery plants, the company said. However, it reiterated that its current ambitions, which include a €52bn investment in electric vehicles and €30bn in software, could be funded using existing free cash flow.</p> <p>VW warned the “feasibility of an IPO depends on several different parameters as well as general market conditions”, and “no final decisions” had been made.</p><p>Source: Joe Miller in Salzgitter 2022 'VW to offer only non-voting shares to public in €20bn Porsche listing' FT.com 25 February.
