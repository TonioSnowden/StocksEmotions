  "text": "<p>A big jump in UK domestic energy bills in April will probably coincide with falls in the global gas price, creating an “enormous” political challenge unless ministers urgently introduce measures to relieve the pressure on household finances, industry executives have warned.</p> <p>Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the trade body Energy UK, said on Thursday that the projected 50 per cent jump in Britain's energy price cap to £2,000 a year per household would kick in just as there is the usual seasonal drop-off in wholesale gas prices in the spring, due to reduced demand.</p> <p>The cap dictates bills for the majority of British households and is set twice yearly by the regulator Ofgem. The level will next be set on February 7 and come into effect from April. But it is calculated using historic wholesale prices, creating a lag between wholesale market prices and the rates paid by consumers.</p> <p>Ministers have been locked in talks with energy companies for several months exploring how the government could help reduce the impact of rising bills on households. Pressure is mounting on the government to tackle the looming <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd394dc1-076d-4d71-88dc-2a33132185c7\">cost of living crisis</a> as inflation soars. Households will be hardest hit from April with the rise in energy bills coinciding with tax increases.</p> <p>“Our bills are going to go up in the UK as the global gas price falls,” said Pinchbeck, who heads the trade body representing suppliers, including Centrica, Eon UK, EDF Energy and ScottishPower.</p> <p>“You can see why politically that might be an enormous challenge and something difficult for us [as suppliers] to explain to customers,” Pinchbeck told an online event organised by the Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit, a think-tank.</p> <p>“I think it's untenable that the government doesn't do something urgently on bills,” she said, pointing out that not only will surging bills plunge more households into fuel poverty, but they will also have a big impact on inflation and the cost of public debt.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs has predicted headline inflation will hit 6.8 per cent year-on-year in April, when the cap goes up.</p> <p>The government has been considering various interventions, including cutting the 5 per cent value added tax rate on energy bills and removing “green” levies that fund renewable energy policies from bills. But it could choose to just limit support to the most vulnerable households. </p> <p>Other options include state-backed loans to energy companies to keep customer charges down or <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87beedce-9b1f-4a7e-bfaf-d4a3b4f1703f\">intervention</a> in the wholesale market to stabilise prices.</p> <p>Pinchbeck said the government could initially take the simplest route and cut the cost of bills, possibly by expanding the Warm Homes Discount scheme, which reduces bills for the most vulnerable households, before February 7. But she thought it would take longer to implement any of the more complex proposals. </p> <p>Nigel Pocklington, the chief executive of green energy supplier Good Energy, agreed that the expansion of the Warm Homes Discount was one of the more likely options for ministers, although he warned the scheme is funded by other households through their energy bills.</p> <p>Pocklington said ministers should be clear whether any extra costs for the scheme would be met by bill payers or whether it was “best met through general taxation”.</p> <p>The government said it was already supporting vulnerable households but recognised the pressures people were facing with the rising cost of living. “We'll continue to listen to consumers and businesses on how to manage the costs of energy,” it added.</p><p>Source: Nathalie Thomas in Edinburgh 2022 'UK energy bills set to rise just as global gas prices fall' FT.com 20 January.
