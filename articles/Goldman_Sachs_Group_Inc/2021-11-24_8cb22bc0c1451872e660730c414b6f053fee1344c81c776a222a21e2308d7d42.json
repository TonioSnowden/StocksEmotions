  "text": "<p>Markets aren't reacting well because of risks that the new nominee either isn't sufficiently independent from the government or qualified for the job in terms of technical background, knowledge and technical experience, said Goldman Sachs' chief Latin America economist, Alberto Ramos.</p><p>\"Not much is known about her,\" he added.</p><p>Ms. Rodríguez is an economist from Mexico's Tecnológico de Monterrey university, with a master's degree in economics from El Colegio de México university, and has held a number of positions in the finance ministry.</p><p>Mr. López Obrador shrugged off the peso losses, which he attributed to the overall strength in the dollar.</p><p>Mr. López Obrador said he would send the nomination to the Senate for ratification this week. If ratified, Ms. Rodríguez would be the third woman on the central bank's five-member board of governors and its first female governor. The term of the current central bank Gov. Alejandro Díaz de León ends on Dec. 31.</p><p>\"For the first time a woman will be at the head of the Bank of Mexico,\" Mr. López Obrador said, adding that Ms. Rodríguez has been outstanding at the finance ministry, overseeing federal spending. \"Thanks to her we have financial stability, and we haven't resorted to additional debt.\"</p><p>Her nomination comes as the central bank is facing rising inflationary headwinds.</p><p>Consumer price inflation was 7.05% in mid-November, its highest level since 2001 and more than twice the central bank's 3% target.</p><p>The central bank has raised its overnight interest-rate four times since June from 4% to the current 5%, and is widely expected to increase it to 5.25% at its December meeting.</p><p>Mr. López Obrador's previous choice to head the central bank, former finance minister, Arturo Herrera, said late Tuesday that the president told him a week ago that he had reconsidered the decision.</p><p>Write to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.com and Santiago Pérez at santiago.perez@wsj.com</p><p>Mexican President Nominates Deputy Finance Minister Victoria Rodriguez as Next Central Bank Chief</p>",
