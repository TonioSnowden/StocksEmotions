  "text": "<p>Hoping for a refund from a flight you couldn't take because of Covid? You're bang out of luck. </p> <p>The Competition and Markets Authority opened an investigation into British Airways and Ryanair <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a57b9625-da8e-4f76-b022-f6f3fa43e9d3\">in June</a> over their refusal to offer customers refunds when they couldn't fly, instead offering them the option to rebook or, in BA's case, vouchers. </p> <p>This morning the watchdog has closed its probe, concluding that “a lack of clarity in the law” means it can't justify continuing to pursue the companies over their refund policies. </p> <p>CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said the regulator “strongly believes” that if people were legally blocked from taking flights because of lockdown laws, they should be offered a full refund. But it seems the law doesn't allow it. So until the law changes, we're going to have to suck it up. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Shell</strong> will take a $400m hit to third-quarter earnings from <strong>Hurricane Ida</strong> in the Gulf of Mexico, the oil company said this morning. The hurricane caused “significant structural damage” to one of Shell's offshore platform facilities in the Gulf, with full repairs likely to take until the end of the year. </p> <p><strong>Robert Walters </strong>is the latest to report on the back of the recruitment boom. The recruiter said that after the end of the third quarter, full-year profit was now expected to be “comfortably ahead” of the guidance it gave at its half-year results. Revenues were up by more than a quarter on the same period last year during the three months until the end of September — but still 13 per cent lower than during the third quarter of 2019.</p> <p>Also out today are updates from spread betting site <strong>CMC Markets</strong> and car dealership group <strong>Pendragon</strong>. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>The group behind <strong>Pret A Manger</strong>, <strong>Panera Bread</strong> and <strong>Krispy Kreme</strong> is seeking to raise a $5bn fund to invest in the booming petcare market. <strong>JAB Holding</strong>, which manages the fortune of the billionaire Reimann family, has struck more than $50bn of deals in the consumer sector over the past few years, including through JAB Consumer Partners. With its previous $6bn of funds, JAB bought up veterinary businesses. It now <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/93a23966-1b26-4e7b-aa0c-9ff2654e9990\">plans to target petcare services</a>, a market that has thrived through lockdowns. </p> <p><strong>Hedge funds</strong> are cashing in after buying up energy stocks dumped by green investors. Fund managers in the UK and the US are now reaping big gains as energy prices surge. Among those benefiting are Crispin Odey, Goldman Sachs's prime brokerage division, and Bison Interests, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ed11c971-be02-47dc-875b-90762b35080e\">Laurence Fletcher reports</a>. </p> <p>And two <strong>Amazon</strong> stories from our correspondent Dave Lee in San Francisco: Twitch, the live-streaming platform owned by the US group, suffered a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3ba9c33-72d7-4f89-8ae2-bdefc6b67a00\">huge data breach</a> exposing the service's source code, the income of its biggest stars and other sensitive information. Meanwhile, Amazon has won a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/164b2c3d-c7e1-4107-bc6f-ec6375dd3416\">record amount of tax breaks</a> this year as local officials try to lure the online shopping giant to expand its one-day or same-day delivery networks in their areas.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>If you haven't had enough of me (and fair enough if you have), then please do check out my column on <strong>Tesco</strong> and what the retailer's results tell us about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4744a4ef-8bdf-47c9-ad33-ae70e8d44259\">the outlook for British business</a>.
