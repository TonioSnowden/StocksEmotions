  "title": "Stock Futures Rise Ahead of Bank Earnings; Investors say rallies could prove short-lived as economists forecast looming recession",
  "text": "<p>Investors said the big gains and losses underscored angst over a possible recession and the pace of interest-rates rises, rather than fundamental changes in the economy. Adding to those worries, recent inflation data showed rapid price growth has been hard to slow, making it more likely that the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates aggressively.</p><p>\"We're going into a global recession so there's very little scope for anything to be rallying,\" said Hani Redha, a portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments. \"There's still a downtrend here.\"</p><p>Up ahead, investors will parse earnings from Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon and Charles Schwab before the bell. Some of the biggest U.S. banks reporting last week said they were nervous of a recession, but their third-quarter earnings showed few signs of one yet.</p><p>Earnings season gathers pace this week with results due in the coming days from Goldman Sachs Group, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Netflix and Tesla, among other major companies. Results and guidance from executives about the next few quarters will pose a test for a market that has been buffeted by rising rates this year.</p><p>Though analysts cut estimates for third-quarter earnings growth in recent months, some investors say forecasts are still too upbeat about the prospects for corporate profits over the next year, given the likelihood of a recession. The U.S. is forecast to contract and unemployment to rise in the coming 12 months, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of economists.</p><p>\"The market has priced the Fed hikes and the tightening of financial conditions quite well but it hasn't priced the impact of that tightening yet,\" Mr. Redha said.</p><p>In the bond market, yields on 10-year Treasury notes slipped to 3.966%, from 4.005% Friday. Yields have risen for 11 consecutive weeks, driven by the Fed's campaign of interest-rate increases.</p><p>Global markets were broadly higher. Oil-and-gas stocks led the Stoxx Europe 600 up 0.8%.</p><p>U.K. government bonds and sterling rallied after the government said it would lay out new tax-and-spend policies Monday. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt is expected to reverse tax cuts laid out by his predecessor. The policies had sent U.K. markets into turmoil and led the Bank of England to launch an emergency intervention, which ended Friday.</p><p>In Asia, the Shanghai Composite Index added 0.4% after President Xi Jinping's speech at a crucial meeting of the Chinese Communist Party. Mr. Xi defended the government's zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 and said Beijing wouldn't rule out force as a means of unifying with Taiwan.</p><p>Write to Joe Wallace at joe.wallace@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Rise Ahead of Bank Earnings</p>",
