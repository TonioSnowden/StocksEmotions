  "text": "<p>Your article (“Goldman boosts junior salaries after burnout fears”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b33f3645-ff93-4309-a575-f92641faaa43\">Report</a>, August 3) reports that Goldman Sachs will raise junior salaries in response to recent complaints from new recruits about burnout (“Goldman analysts' 95-hour week stirs soul searching on Wall Street”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f5d2587-d9a7-4cd5-ac84-e36d75b13a24\">Report</a>, March 27). </p> <p>At first blush, such an initiative seems reasonable because a pay boost may bridge the gap between excessive work demands and ostensibly lagging pay levels.</p> <p>Nevertheless, increased pay does nothing per se to reduce work demands. Worse still, it can have the counterintuitive implication that burnout complaints among juniors will escalate rather than decrease. </p> <p>After all, pay boosts may create perverse incentives on the part of employers. Once committed to higher salaries, employers might quite simply feel justified to put yet greater pressures on juniors in the future.</p> <p>Salary levels certainly play their part in establishing a healthy employment relationship. Yet, because work demands may increase following a salary raise, we would be naive to count on increased pay alone to redress the imbalance between work demands and employee rewards. </p> <p>It is crucial that employers also meet their moral obligation to be proactive in managing and limiting pressures on their employees.</p> <p>No amount of extra money can credibly legitimate the psychological and physical suffering that will continue otherwise. </p> <p><strong>Hans TW Frankort</strong> <br><em>Reader in Strategy, Bayes Business School (formerly Cass), London EC1, UK</em></p> <p><strong>Argyro Avgoustaki</strong></p> <p><em>Associate Professor of Management, ESCP Business School, London NW3, UK</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Paying juniors more will not cure banker burnout' FT.com 5 August.
