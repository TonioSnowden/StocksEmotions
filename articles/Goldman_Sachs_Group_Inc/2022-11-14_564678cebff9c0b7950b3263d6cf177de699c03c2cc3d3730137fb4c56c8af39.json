  "text": "<p>The move carries risks, since investing via derivatives makes investors more exposed to changes in the value of an underlying asset. That makes it effectively a form of leverage, similar to using borrowed money, since it amplifies an investment's potential gains or losses.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Is it a good idea for pension funds to add derivatives to their stock portfolios? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>There are also benefits. By doing this, pensions can keep hold of their LDI positions, while also generating returns linked to the stock market. LDI is meant to hedge against big moves in bond yields, which in turn help determine pension liabilities.</p><p>Derivatives positions can also be closed more quickly than traditional shares can be sold, if an investor needs cash fast. And by shifting some leverage from U.K. government bonds, or gilts, to stocks, the move can spread risk more evenly throughout a pension's portfolio.</p><p>Some clients of Cardano Investment have recently reconfigured their portfolios this way, said Chief Executive Officer Kerrin Rosenberg. Cardano both advises on and manages LDI portfolios.</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp.'s Insight Investment, and a unit of Britain's Legal &amp; General Group PLC in recent weeks have been discussing with clients shifting from physical holdings to so-called synthetic positions, industry participants said.</p><p>And a July note from BlackRock Inc., one of the largest LDI managers, urged pension plans to consider synthetic investments in equity and credit, or corporate debt, to help free up collateral.</p><p>Market participants caution that employing equity derivatives could create challenges. Stocks are typically more volatile than bonds. That makes the use of leverage, also known as gearing, potentially more risky. And any sudden selloff could spill over into other asset classes.</p><p>\"The thought of gearing gilts is something pension-fund trustees have become accustomed to over the past decade,\" said Bob Campion, head of fiduciary management at Charles Stanley, a division of Raymond James Financial Inc.</p><p>\"To gear your equities is a much riskier strategy,\" he said. \"The sort of movements we've had in the gilt market that we think are extreme, you can easily imagine a scenario where it's more likely for that to happen in equities markets.\"</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 has fallen at least 2% on 22 trading days this year, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>Investors holding a derivative tied to an index like the S&amp;P 500 would typically make a paper gain when the benchmark rises. When it falls, however, they would suffer a paper loss and might be required to post extra collateral, potentially forcing them to sell other assets in a hurry.</p><p>In falling stock markets, derivatives could act as a \"channel of contagion,\" said Carolyn Sissoko, a senior lecturer at the University of the West of England who has studied the role of these instruments in financial markets. For instance, funds might have to sell bonds to meet equity derivative collateral calls, she said.</p><p>Another concern is if bond and stock markets tumble together, pension funds might have to scramble to fulfill multiple margin calls at once. Markets have, unusually, broadly moved in tandem this year: For the first time since 1976, global bonds fell alongside the S&amp;P 500 for three consecutive quarters, Strategas Research data for January through September shows.</p><p>To be sure, only a minority of pension investors, typically larger funds, use equity derivatives. That makes it unlikely that the instruments will pose a systemic risk akin to that created by contracts tied to gilts. Industry participants say that bond derivatives have been the easiest and cheapest way to introduce leverage into a pension portfolio.</p><p>While nearly all of ClearGlass Analytics' 700-plus pension-fund clients invest in stocks, less than 3% of those use synthetic equities, the research firm says. And Mr. Rosenberg of Cardano estimated only 5% to 10% of pension funds would adopt equity derivatives.</p><p>Pension funds need to ensure they hold enough collateral to withstand shocks to both markets, investment consultants say.</p><p>\"I see this as a sensible addition to the toolbox,\" as long as funds don't increase their overall exposure to market movements, and focus on easy-to-trade indexes with transparent pricing and low trading costs, said Simon Bentley, who advises pension clients at Columbia Threadneedle Investments.</p><p>Pension trustee Andy McKinnell helped oversee a fund two years ago that needed to generate extra returns and retain its LDI hedges. The more-than-£500 million pension plan decided it was worth taking the risk to reach its performance target, Mr. McKinnell said, and converted 10% of its overall portfolio into synthetic holdings.</p><p>—Caitlin Ostroff and Chelsey Dulaney contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com</p><p>U.K. Pensions Dabble in Stock Derivatives After Bond Blowup</p>",
