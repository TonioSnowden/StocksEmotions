  "text": "<p>Of American</p><p>Power</p><p>----</p><p>By Margaret MacMillan</p><p>Some memories do not fade with time, and I find it hard to believe that the horrors of 9/11 happened 20 years ago. Yet when I think about the position of the U.S. in the world then and now, I realize how much things have changed.</p><p>After the attacks, sympathy for Americans was heartfelt and world-wide. \"We are all Americans,\" said the left-leaning Paris weekly Le Monde. Russian President Vladimir Putin -- yes, Putin -- condemned \"the barbaric acts,\" and Russians wept in the streets. In Beijing, the sidewalk outside the American embassy was lined with flowers and cards.</p><p>Twenty years later, Russia and China talk openly about the U.S. as a strategic threat, while even allies such as France and Canada, my own country, have grown skeptical about the uses of American power and wary of American leadership.</p><p>Some of this was bound to happen. No nation, as the British found in their time, is loved for being the world's hegemon. Other states, both friendly and potentially hostile, have their own interests that do not always mesh with America's. Yet the failure in Iraq and now the tragic American withdrawal from Afghanistan have accelerated the perception of the U.S. as a wounded giant, ready perhaps to relinquish its role as what Madeleine Albright once called \"the indispensable nation.\"</p><p>After 9/11, American allies in NATO had been unanimous in supporting the war on the Taliban, with the exception of the U.K. and a handful of smaller powers, they refused to participate in the war against Saddam Hussein. The international cooperation that had done so much to prevent further terrorist acts started to fray in the face of American unilateralism. As the situations in both Afghanistan and Iraq worsened, American public opinion turned firmly in favor of withdrawal.</p><p>Terrorists and rogue states have grown more emboldened by American failures. Putin seized Crimea, and his \"green men\" wage an undeclared war in eastern Ukraine, while the Iranian Revolutionary Guard carry on destabilizing large parts of the Middle East. The near financial collapse of 2008, the increasingly rancorous divisions in American society, the rapid rise of China under an increasingly confrontational Xi Jinping: All have shaken American confidence and the confidence of America's allies in its leadership.</p><p>We Canadians have always seen the U.S. as a cousin -- far richer and more powerful -- and we have at times criticized it. But now we find ourselves worrying, in company with many other democracies, about how wounded it is and whether it will withdraw into isolation. Will we have to deal with China instead, or live uneasily in an anarchic, multipolar world? The winds today are cold and picking up. Small nations like my own shiver.</p><p>---</p><p>Ms. MacMillan is a professor of history at the University of Toronto and the author, most recently, of \"War: How Conflict Shaped Us.\"</p><p>---</p><p>A New</p><p>Age of</p><p>Conspiracy</p><p>Theories</p><p>----</p><p>By Ted Widmer</p><p>The Sept. 11 attacks shattered a reality Americans had lived with for as long as anyone could remember. The U.S. had been invaded before: There are still singe marks on the White House to prove it, a legacy of the British invasion of 1814. And the U.S.S. Arizona, lying in the water off Pearl Harbor, bears its own silent witness. But for most of American history, a strike like the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon was inconceivable. We were too far from the world's problems, and too powerful.</p><p>The result was an enduring psychic injury, as damaging as the attacks themselves. The smoke had barely cleared when a new kind of cloud settled, bringing with it a distrust of official answers and a willingness to believe in conspiracies far more outlandish than the one by al Qaeda that had succeeded. As with the assassination of John F. Kennedy, 9/11 was followed by a wave of incredulity, as millions simply refused to believe the official story and instead sought comfort in alternative history.</p><p>The historian Richard Hofstadter happened to give his first version of the talk that became his book \"The Paranoid Style in American Politics\" on Nov. 21, 1963, the eve of the Kennedy assassination. But even he could not have anticipated just how paranoid America would become in the 1960s and 1970s. With each assassination that followed, skepticism deepened over official explanations. The Pentagon Papers and Watergate only added to the public's distrust of government-speak.</p><p>The scorched-earth politics of the 1990s did little to restore confidence. Americans were already growing restive before 9/11, lashing out against the government from Oklahoma City, where right-wing terrorist Timothy McVeigh blew up the federal building in 1995, to Seattle, where left-wing rioters broke up a meeting of the World Trade Organization in 1999.</p><p>The Internet, still coming into its own, added more fuel to these fires. In 1963, Americans got their news from family-run newspapers and three national networks, mostly centrist. By 2001 that world was fading, as 24-hour cable TV and web-based bloggers dominated a fray that was growing louder by the minute.</p><p>Alternative histories grew prolifically in these lush breeding grounds, even after a sober, well-crafted official history was delivered with the 9/11 Report. Since then, conspiracy theorists have proliferated, replacing known facts with a Pandora's box of imagined culprits, including the U.S. government itself. That distrust has been corrosive to our democracy, giving extremists a permanent stage for the politics of unreality.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Widmer is Distinguished Lecturer at the Macaulay Honors College of the City University of New York and the author, most recently, of \"Lincoln on the Verge: Thirteen Days to Washington.\"</p><p>---</p><p>Vast Spending</p><p>With Dubious</p><p>Returns</p><p>----</p><p>By Adam Tooze</p><p>The global war on terror triggered by 9/11 was a vast undertaking. It took hundreds of thousands of lives, reshaped America's relations with large parts of the world and challenged its moral compass. It also involved spending a lot of money.</p><p>Total spending by the Defense Department, the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security from 2001 to 2020, including current and likely future spending on veterans, comes to $5.4 trillion, or about $230 billion a year. That is just over 1% of 2021 [gross domestic product]. That's a lot. But it is also low enough to explain why it was possible for the U.S. to carry on for much of that time as though nothing were happening.</p><p>The financial impact was further obscured by the way in which the war on terror was financed. Before 2001, U.S. wars were funded through tax increases or major bond drives. But the George W. Bush administration introduced tax cuts, resulting in deficits. The lessons [John Maynard] Keynes taught about deficits and debt apply to the war on terror too.</p><p>Government spending creates income and drives the economy, regardless of what the money is spent on. Most American spending \"in\" Iraq or Afghanistan actually cycled back to the U.S. It is regrettable that the Pentagon allowed itself to be gouged by private contractors, but the employees of those companies earned good upper-middle-class wages, and expanding the ranks of the U.S. military offered new opportunities of upward mobility for minorities and working-class Americans.</p><p>The U.S. issued a lot of debt, but investors showed no lack of appetite. Interest rates slumped as American and foreign investors flocked into Treasurys.</p><p>As Dwight Eisenhower warned, beyond creating demand, military spending reshapes the economy. The war on terror was a notorious boondoggle. But in an age in which Goldman Sachs CEOs ran the Treasury and big tech grew unchecked, the \"camo economy\" was just one piece of a bigger picture.</p><p>The basic reason that military procurement shenanigans bulk so large in the folklore of Washington is that the Pentagon accounts for fully half of all discretionary spending by the federal government. And that is also the saddest thing about the economics of the war on terror. In an age of profound domestic division, one of the few things that Americans could actually rally around was war-fighting. It was the country's largest collective enterprise of the last 20 years.</p><p>And what did it leave us? The cost was vast and out of all proportion to the modest successes achieved. It did not heal the wounds of American society. And in Afghanistan, where the campaign began, it ended in a shameful scramble, leaving vast mounds of abandoned materiel as its monument.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Tooze is a professor of history at Columbia University and the author, most recently, of \"Shutdown: How Covid Shook the World's Economy.\"</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
