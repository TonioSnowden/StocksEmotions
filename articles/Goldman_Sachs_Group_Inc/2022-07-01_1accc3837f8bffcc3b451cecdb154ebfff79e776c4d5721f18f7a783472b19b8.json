  "text": "<p>To prepare for the rest of the year, The Wall Street Journal asked some leading investors and strategists to share their outlooks for the second half of 2022.</p><p>Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income and head of the global allocation team, BlackRock Inc.</p><p>\"We haven't seen risk assets go down this hard in at least 50 years. But the other side of downturns like this are almost always significant bouncebacks.\"</p><p>\"Investors need to be forward-thinking about opportunities as the market stabilizes. I don't recall the prices of good quality assets looking so attractive in years.\"</p><p>\"I'm very enthusiastic about these levels in yields, spreads, and dollar prices in credit markets today. In the second half of the year, credit will be one of the best opportunities in markets.\"</p><p>\"I have a strong view that the Federal Reserve will back off sooner rather than later because of the number of jobs that will have to be sacrificed by largely supply-driven inflation.\"</p><p>David Kelly, chief global strategist and head of the global market insights strategy team, J.P. Morgan Asset Management</p><p>\"We're going to see a bounce. The threat of recession has grown, and the economy is certainly going to slow down. But inflation will come down, prompting the Fed to slow down as well. Unless there's a shock, stocks and bonds can rally.\"</p><p>\"The second half of the year will be a rollover race between growth and inflation. I think inflation will rollover before the jobs market turns sour, and that will be a positive for markets.\"</p><p>\"The key meeting for the Federal Reserve is the September meeting. The Fed will have two mild inflation prints in their pocket, and they'll sign a more dovish tune because they can see clear signs that economic growth is slowing down.\"</p><p>\"The nasty correction in the first half of the year made most assets cheaper. The forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&amp;P 500 is below its 25-year average, and bonds have finally regained some of their income characteristics. As people lick their wounds from the first half of the year, they need to realize there is plenty of opportunity.\"</p><p>\"People shouldn't hesitate to invest. They should think clearly about what they're going to invest in, but they shouldn't hesitate.\"</p><p>Mark Spitznagel, founder and chief investment officer, Universa Investments</p><p>\"The worst case scenario is if the Fed is happy to tank the economy, because our economy is too fragile to take it. We cannot endure a recession anymore. There's too much deadwood; we're sitting in a tinderbox.\"</p><p>\"Investors should think strategically about their portfolios and avoid relying on forecasts. If you take a forecast and apply it to the market, the cure you come up with will be worse than the disease.\"</p><p>\"The Fed cannot tighten as much as they are forecasting without popping the credit bubble. We've gone too far. We'll never see a true tightening cycle ever again, because the destruction will be too great.\"</p><p>Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management</p><p>\"My highest conviction bet is that markets will remain volatile throughout the summer. Markets have been very sensitive to every economic data point that gets released. The risks are asymmetric, and they're skewed toward the downside.\"</p><p>\"The Fed won't stop tightening until they see inflation cooling, and services inflation won't come down until the labor market softens.\"</p><p>Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist, Charles Schwab Corp.</p><p>\"The bear market has everything to do with the Fed. The ship was pointed toward massive stimulus, and now the ship is toward tighter financial conditions. It's the classic end of a cycle.\"</p><p>\"I think not only a recession is likely, I think we may already be in one.\"</p><p>\"I don't think the Fed's tightening has been reflected yet in corporate profits. In the second half of the year, that may represent the next source of indigestion for stocks.\"</p><p>David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p><p>\"Our base case at Goldman Sachs is there's a 50/50 chance whether we enter a recession or not. Portfolio managers need to be prepared for a recession, and set up a balanced portfolio postured for either scenario.\"</p><p>\"Long-term, earnings drive stocks. In the first half of the year, valuation compression drove equity prices. In the second half of the year, the trajectory of the earnings will be the driving force.</p><p>\"Seek stability in a stormy environment, whether it be at the thematic, sector, or stock level.\"</p><p>Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist and chief investment officer of Morgan Stanley</p><p>\"We won't see downward earnings revisions fully priced in until the fourth quarter. Until we do, equities won't rebound. Bonds are primed to outperform stocks in the second half of the year.\"</p><p>\"The probability of a recession is rising, but even our bear case is for a mild recession.\"</p><p>\"Our base case is a garden-variety recession in the next six months, followed by a reacceleration that's helpful for corporate profits.\"</p><p>\"A lot of clients are asking us about the possibility of a stagflationary recession; that's not the way we see this playing out. Even if growth is down in the fall, inflation may still be high, because it's a backward-looking data point.\"</p><p>Related Articles</p><p>* Wild First Half in Markets Sets Stage for More Big Moves in Rest of 2022</p><p>* S&amp;P 500 Posts Worst First Half of Year Since 1970</p><p>* How to Stand Up to a Bear Market</p><p>Where Does the Market Go From Here?
