  "title": "Talen Energy to Hand Power-Plant Business to Bondholders; The company placed power-generation facilities in bankruptcy after last year's natural-gas rally caused a cash crunch",
  "text": "<p>A group of unsecured bondholders have agreed to provide $1.65 billion in equity financing to Talen to take control of its fleet of nuclear-, gas- and coal-fired facilities, one of the largest in the country. Bondholders would also convert $1.4 billion in debt to equity, while the company's $2.9 billion in secured debt would be paid in full under its proposed restructuring.</p><p>The Riverstone-backed company faced a liquidity crunch stemming from a gas-price rally last year that forced the company to post additional collateral under energy hedging contracts, according to court papers filed on Monday by the company's financial adviser, Ryan Leland Omohundro. Talen operates 18 generation facilities with a collective capacity of roughly 13,000 megawatts, Mr. Omohundro said.</p><p>Talen kept out of bankruptcy a cryptocurrency mining operation being constructed close to the company's Susquehanna, Pa., nuclear plant. Called Cumulus Growth, the project comprises a digital currency mining center as well as data centers and renewable energy and battery storage projects.</p><p>Scheduled to begin mining bitcoin in the third quarter, it is one of several partnerships between crypto ventures and nuclear plant operators that aims to address environmental criticisms of bitcoin production by linking them to carbon-free nuclear generation.</p><p>The company developed the crypto-mining platform as a growth opportunity as demand in the region where it supplies power—the Northeast and part of the Midwest—has remained flat, according to the court filing by Mr. Omohundro.</p><p>Talen is under pressure from regulatory authorities and its own financing sources to become more environmentally friendly and reduce carbon emissions, Mr. Omohundro said. Sustainability mandates have resulted in \"unfavorable lending policies and difficulty raising capital toward financing for traditional fossil fuel-powered generation,\" according to his declaration.</p><p>Talen said it needed to file for chapter 11 largely because of \"immediate and significant liquidity concerns that can be traced back to the sudden and sustained rise of natural-gas prices\" last year. The business took out a $848 million rescue loan from GoldenTree Asset Management LP and Silver Point Finance LP last year, anticipating that power prices would rise during the winter and help generate the cash needed to meet hedging requirements, court papers say.</p><p>Instead, power prices declined during the mild winter. The rescue loan would be paid in full under the proposed restructuring, which requires approval from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. The bondholders that signed on to the restructuring deal hold 62% of the company's roughly $1.4 billion in unsecured notes, according to court papers.</p><p>Talen has landed a $1.76 billion bankruptcy loan to carry it through the chapter 11 process, funded by Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>Riverstone formed Talen in 2014 out of a unit spun off from PPL Corp., and later merged the company with another independent power producer controlled by the private-equity firm, according to court papers.</p><p>As part of the bankruptcy, Talen is now suing PPL, alleging it took nearly $900 million from sale proceeds and paid itself, leaving a former Montana subsidiary unable to meet environmental and other financial obligations. PPL didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Talen is being advised by Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges LLP and Evercore Group LLC.</p><p>The case has been assigned to Judge Marvin Isgur, case number 22-90054.</p><p>Akiko Matsuda and Andrew Scurria contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Alexander Gladstone at alexander.gladstone@wsj.com and Soma Biswas at soma.biswas@wsj.com</p><p>Talen Energy to Hand Power-Plant Business to Bondholders</p>",
