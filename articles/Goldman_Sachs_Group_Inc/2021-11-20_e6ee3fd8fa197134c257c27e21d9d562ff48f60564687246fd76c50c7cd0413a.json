  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Playing an Unorthodox Hand --- This poker-playing, bond-trading Orthodox Jew is giving away everything he wins. But is it kosher?",
  "text": "<p>\"It's pretty impressive,\" said Ari Engel, a professional poker player whom Mr. Distenfeld knocked out on the way to his recent win. \"He's gotten quite good at poker just doing it part time.\"</p><p>He also refuses to play against friends in private games citing ethical reasons, donates all of his takings to charity and has launched a campaign urging all winners at the World Series to give away at least 1% of what they make.</p><p>The Modern Orthodox observe traditional Jewish precepts while mixing with the society that surrounds them, unlike the ultra Orthodox, or Hasidim, who sometimes shun modernity.</p><p>While the \"1% challenge\" has won him fans in Las Vegas, reactions in Orthodox circles have been mixed.</p><p>\"Judaism is not all that happy about gambling,\" said Harry Maryles, author of a blog on the Orthodox Jewish community in a recent post about Mr. Distenfeld. \"It is difficult to praise someone that won a lot of money at a game of poker -- even if he gives all of it away to people that really need it.\"</p><p>The kvetching doesn't faze Mr. Distenfeld, who has clashed with others in his community on topics ranging from parochial education to Covid-19 quarantines.</p><p>\"I don't want to be a role model for anyone in ritual observance,\" Mr. Distenfeld said. \"I want to see role models out there that are good people trying to make the world a better place.\"</p><p>Mr. Distenfeld has given away $330,000 of poker winnings and donates at least 10% of his seven-figure income annually in accordance with the Jewish concept of philanthropy, he said. While he donates actively, he took steps this year to reduce tax spending, he said, moving his family to Florida from New Jersey.</p><p>Charities Mr. Distenfeld supports include NCSY Chesed Missions, which send Jewish youth to build and repair homes across the U.S., and Minds Matter, a nonprofit that helps low-income students succeed academically and professionally.</p><p>Mr. Distenfeld started out at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., which later became AllianceBernstein Holding LP, in 1998 as a back-office project manager. He parlayed a knack for numbers into a job on the high-yield investing team, which he eventually ran before taking his current role.</p><p>Mr. Distenfeld can calculate in his head the probability that a bond will pay off as an investment based on its price, something most investors do with computers, former colleagues said.</p><p>\"He brings that objective risk taking to poker,\" said Ashish Shah, a co-chief of fixed-income investing at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. who was Mr. Distenfeld's boss for eight years at AllianceBernstein. But Mr. Distenfeld's personality bucks math-nerd stereotypes, Mr. Shah said. He is gregarious and \"on bring-your-kids-to-the-office day he'd get his face painted and work the whole day that way,\" he said.</p><p>Mr. Distenfeld began playing small poker tournaments about six years ago on trips to Atlantic City, N.J., and says calculating the range of likely outcomes at the table came easily. He began reading poker strategy books and fantasized about winning a World Series event but his heavy work schedule and familial obligations got in the way.</p><p>\"To get to the pros you need to study four hours for every one hour you play and I don't have that much time for either,\" Mr. Distenfeld said.</p><p>The compromise he struck with himself -- and his wife, Aviva Distenfeld -- was that he would play only a few tournaments a year and cram his study time into the weeks leading up to the event. Investors who have made it to poker's top echelon, like Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn, who also donates his winnings, and Susquehanna International Group's Bill Chen, have tended to play games in a wide variety of tournaments over the years.</p><p>Mr. Distenfeld got his first break at the World Series in 2020's main event, when he beat about 705 players in online play -- due to pandemic restrictions -- before losing in live play at the final table. Jonathan Little, a Manhattan-based pro who runs a training site PokerCoaching.com, began advising him on competing against professional players. Mr. Little counsels Mr. Distenfeld free of charge because he gives away all his winnings.</p><p>When facing Mr. Engel, who bets big to pressure opponents, Mr. Little counseled his student \"to be aggressive and let Ari know he'd come to play.\" Raising early and often when Mr. Engel placed large wagers made it more expensive for the pro to bluff. \"It was an adjustment designed to get Ari to calm down and it worked,\" Mr. Little said.</p><p>Mr. Distenfeld plays a \"high-variance\" style -- staying in more hands early on -- which increases his chance of winning events overall. At the same time, the strategy increases the risk that he will lose all of his chips early. Mr. Distenfeld made roughly $126,000 for taking eighth place in the main event last year and $204,000 in his win in a different event this year, but \"busted out\" in day one of the World Series main event this year.</p><p>Mr. Distenfeld leans to the conservative end of mainstream politics -- advocating last fall to end quarantine and mask requirements for children. In his religious community though, he has opposed what he calls a shift toward ultra-orthodoxy.</p><p>Some in the community emphasize ritual observance and spend lavishly on religious celebrations but neglect ethics and spirituality, he said.</p><p>He co-founded a low-cost and educationally innovative yeshiva -- the parochial school that Orthodox children attend -- in Teaneck, N.J., which some Orthodox Jews criticized for pulling students and their tuition dollars away from more established schools.</p><p>His poker playing is yet another point of contention. He clashed with some charitable organizations in the Orthodox community because he requires all recipients of his poker winnings to disclose the donations' origins, he said. \"To me it's not a straight thing to take the money and hide where it came from,\" he said.</p>",
