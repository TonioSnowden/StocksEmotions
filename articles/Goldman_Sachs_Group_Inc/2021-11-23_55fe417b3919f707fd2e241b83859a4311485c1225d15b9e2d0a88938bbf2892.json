  "text": "<p><strong>One big shrug to start</strong>: <strong>EY</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b42b0f4-6b93-440f-acd1-513b12e96860\">has filed a criminal complaint</a> over a German newspaper's publication of a classified parliamentary report into its work for disgraced payments company <strong>Wirecard</strong>.</p> <h2>Telecom Italia: KKR calling</h2> <p><strong>Mario Draghi</strong> holds the keys to Europe's largest-ever leveraged buyout. </p> <p>Italy's prime minister can call upon so-called golden power rules to block <strong>KKR</strong>'s proposed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/eef30c1f-48c4-4ac2-9061-684aa19966c6\">€33bn buyout</a> offer for <strong>Telecom Italia </strong>(TIM). The deal would be the largest leveraged buyout since 2007 when KKR, <strong>TPG</strong> and <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> took Texas power company <strong>TXU</strong> private for $48bn.</p> <p>TIM was a direct beneficiary of the&#xa0; <strong>European Central Bank</strong>'s largesse under Draghi's “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82c95514-707d-11e7-93ff-99f383b09ff9\">whatever it takes</a>” gambit. After Draghi's measures, struggling companies like TIM were able to muddle through by raising cheap debt.</p> <p>The central bank bought the company's bonds under its quantitative easing programme. Since the bonds have no change of control protection, there is some irony that current bondholders, the ECB included, would stand to be clobbered if Draghi signed off on a buyout for which KKR raised new secured debt.</p> <p>KKR's offer is the latest twist in the turbulent corporate history of the struggling telecoms group, which involves aborted takeover attempts by <strong>Telefónica</strong> and <strong>AT&amp;T</strong> and a battle for control between <strong>Vivendi</strong> and <strong>Elliott Management</strong>. </p> <p>TIM boss <strong>Luigi Gubitosi</strong> has been under pressure, with two profit warnings and a falling share price. Vivendi, which owns a 24 per cent stake, had been agitating for his removal, and a board meeting had been planned for November 26 to discuss a potential management overhaul. </p> <p>Could a deal with KKR, which already holds a 37.5 per cent stake in TIM's “last mile” network, be a last-ditch rabbit-in-a-hat solution for Gubitosi? “I don't think KKR is in the business of playing the rabbit,” one adviser following the situation told DD.</p> <p>Any deal involving the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8395de3-3db8-4069-be47-a043acbffbe3\">knotty puzzle</a> that is TIM would be complicated to pull off, Lex notes. </p> <p>Still, it is one of several reminders that the era of the private equity mega-deal is back. </p> <p>This month alone there has been <strong>Hellman &amp; Friedman</strong> and <strong>Bain Capital</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24519628-9c86-4b6e-b38c-e03142afa3ee\">$17bn acquisition</a> of healthcare tech company <strong>Athenahealth</strong> and <strong>Advent International</strong>'s talks with antivirus software company <strong>McAfee</strong> over a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae14fb78-80aa-4c0b-afa5-2cc205cc916e\">$14bn deal</a>. &#xa0;</p> <p>The private equity industry doesn't like to be reminded of the TXU deal. By 2014, the company had filed for bankruptcy, in a disaster that seemed to symbolise the worst excesses of the buyouts boom. </p> <h2>McKinsey's private hedge fund runs into trouble</h2> <p>It had operations to rival the world's most sophisticated hedge funds, employing 80 staff across offices in New York, London, Munich and Singapore. </p> <p>Yet until the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/49d83a9c-2b0d-11e6-a18d-a96ab29e3c95\">revealed</a> its inner workings five and a half years ago, few people on Wall Street or in the City of London had ever heard of the <strong>McKinsey Investment Office</strong>, the internal hedge fund within the powerful management consultancy <strong>McKinsey</strong> known as <strong>MIO Partners</strong>.</p> <p>Perhaps that was the point. “It's the <strong>McKinsey</strong> style,” a former partner of the powerful consultancy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7c6700bc-2976-11e6-8b18-91555f2f4fde?shareType=nongift\">told the FT</a> in 2016. “They don't advertise . . . they're open about [MIO Partners] from inside the firm.”</p> <p>But the fund, now managing $31bn and no longer shrouded in secrecy, has also attracted the attention of the <strong>US Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>, the FT's Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson <a href=\"https://on.ft.com/3csvKcT\">reports</a>.</p> <p>The US regulator imposed an $18m penalty on the fund on Friday, alleging that it was investing hundreds of millions of dollars in companies that McKinsey was advising, and that McKinsey partners who oversaw MIO's investment choices routinely had access to confidential information about their clients' financial dealings.</p> <p>MIO didn't admit or deny the SEC's findings but agreed to a cease-and-desist order and the $18m fine. </p> <p>The fund, which invests on behalf of McKinsey partners as a wholly-owned affiliate, was created in 1985 as a means to attract top recruits who were being tempted by exorbitant pay packages in the more lucrative spheres of banking and private equity.</p> <p>The gateway between McKinsey and the upper echelons of Washington, Wall Street and Silicon Valley — through which <strong>Sheryl Sandberg</strong>,<strong> Google</strong>'s <strong>Sundar Pichai</strong> and <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>'s <strong>James Gorman</strong> have travelled — adds credence to that recruitment strategy. </p> <p>But the allure of McKinsey's high-calibre staff and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/63f24181-aee0-49f4-9966-a447d79692f0\">signature “mystique”</a> has faded as the firm has struggled to swat off <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d159f32c-d2f4-465f-8280-313ab78eaed4\">scandal after scandal</a>. </p> <p>Earlier this month, US prosecutors <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/962a94a2-df9c-44a3-a60d-f3ace7c4fa08\">charged a McKinsey partner</a> with securities fraud. The firm also previously <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd3b119a-3476-11e9-bb0c-42459962a812\">paid $15m</a> to the US<strong> Department of Justice</strong> to settle claims that it failed to disclose conflicts of interest in bankruptcy cases.</p> <p>Other fiascos include the firm's work with US opioid manufacturers (which has cost it $600m in settlements), a government <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2db2a6d-693a-49e4-87e2-194183e6445b\">corruption scandal</a> in South Africa, and one of McKinsey's top executives, <strong>Rajat Gupta</strong>, being jailed for insider trading in 2012. </p> <p>Though he was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8923cfde-8a29-4d40-a214-57f6620ac019\">voted out</a> over his handling of the crises, McKinsey's former global managing partner <strong>Kevin Sneader </strong>may be the latest to crack McKinsey's code to success: <em>get in, and get out. </em>Since being ousted he has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61818a23-4561-4e69-8065-ab2fad1dc00b\">landed</a> at<strong> Goldman Sachs</strong> as its new Asia co-president.</p> <h2>No contest: the story behind Unilever's tea sale</h2> <p>We wrote <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fe0f346-b99d-4fed-b51a-1225a88ae82f\">last week</a> about the €4.5bn sale of <strong>Unilever</strong>'s tea division to the private equity firm <strong>CVC Capital Partners</strong>, after a long-running sale process that pitted the Luxembourg group against US rivals <strong>Advent International</strong> and <strong>Carlyle</strong>. </p> <p>Turns out that, at least in its final days, it wasn't much of a contest at all. </p> <p>Advent had made a “non-compliant” bid — aka an offer that didn't match the seller's specifications — and Carlyle had dropped out of the contest altogether just days before a final deadline. </p> <p>Both balked at the idea of owning the unit's tea plantations in east Africa, which face difficult questions over human rights and fair pay.</p> <p>Advent's offer excluded the tea estates after a report on the plantations that was produced for the buyout group “didn't make for pretty reading”, according to one person with knowledge of the situation.</p> <p>Bosses on the plantations hold power over workers' jobs, housing and medical care. There have been reports of sexual harassment, to which Unilever responded with measures including more female leaders, training and an ethics hotline. </p> <p>Unilever has also come into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea19051f-c603-425e-8b8f-72cc11fe8b3e\">conflict with workers</a> as it automates tea picking jobs and reduces headcount.</p> <p>CVC has previously argued that the tea business, renamed <strong>Ekaterra</strong>, is “well-positioned to lead the category's sustainable development”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Private equity has started talking more about the importance of improving companies' environmental, social and governance credentials in recent years. This deal looks set to be one of its most important tests. </p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p>US President <strong>Joe Biden </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b1f7aa8-206f-4d54-bccc-3f9eeddb9f51\">has picked</a><strong> Jay Powell </strong>for a second term as chair of the <strong>Federal Reserve</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>UBS</strong> <a href=\"https://on.ft.com/3x5UH7f\">has proposed</a> former <strong>Morgan Stanley </strong>president <strong>Colm Kelleher</strong> as its next chair, succeeding <strong>Axel Weber</strong> when he steps down next year after a decade overseeing the Swiss lender.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Former <strong>Aegon</strong> chief executive and <strong>Citigroup</strong> board member <strong>Alex Wynaendts</strong> is <a href=\"https://on.ft.com/3HAmYYJ\">set to succeed</a> <strong>Paul Achleitner</strong> as <strong>Deutsche Bank </strong>chair next year. Achleitner, a former <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> banker and <strong>Allianz</strong> finance chief, joined Deutsche Bank's board in 2012.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Deutsche Bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03a843a8-5ff5-4c24-aaaa-271e5dd291c5\">has also appointed</a><strong> Olivier Vigneron</strong> from French rival <strong>Natixis</strong> to replace <strong>Stuart Lewis</strong> as chief risk officer. Vigneron held various senior risk roles at <strong>JPMorgan Chase </strong>for over a decade until 2019.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>SoftBank</strong>'s Vision Fund has promoted four investing partners to managing partner, including <strong>Lydia Jett</strong>, the first woman investor to hold the title. </p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Culture shock </strong>European banks have failed to crack Wall Street thus far, lacking the scale and strategy to compete with local giants and rising fintech challengers. (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/788b418f-4a85-411d-8645-503d226f4e01\">FT</a>)</p> <p><strong>Back to the office (sometimes) </strong>The emergence of the hybrid work week hasn't been met by a rise in flexible office space, leaving landlords to sweat over the empty desks.
