  "text": "<p>Chancellor Rishi Sunak is set to secure a public finances windfall in the autumn as the UK's strong economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis rapidly improves the outlook for government borrowing, according to a Financial Times analysis. </p> <p>Sunak should have the opportunity to invest more in public services that have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, and might even be able to cut taxes in the run-up to the next general election. </p> <p>As recently as the chancellor's March 3 Budget, Britain's fiscal watchdog predicted the government would need to borrow £233.9bn in 2021-22 to deal with the pandemic, but the FT calculates the figure could now be as low as £150bn. </p> <p>Treasury officials, who have undertaken similar analyses, said they expected Sunak will be able to deliver a “good news” Budget and public spending review in the autumn because of the fast economic rebound and strong recovery in tax receipts.</p> <p>But some officials worry Boris Johnson will want to blow some of the windfall on pet projects.</p> <p>And officials across government are concerned that if the coronavirus variant first identified in India spirals out of control in the UK, requiring more lockdowns, the good news in the autumn Budget and spending review would be far more muted. </p> <p>The rapid improvement in the public finance outlook in the two months since the Budget has three components: the Office for Budget Responsibility's miscalculations on the 2020-21 deficit, a much stronger than expected recovery, and signs there will be less long-term economic damage from the pandemic than feared. </p> <p>The government's extraordinary response to the crisis — spending hundreds of billions of pounds on job protection, loans and grants for companies, and the NHS — would have tested any forecaster in 2020-21.</p> <p>In its initial assessment of its performance, published last month, the OBR said it made “by far the largest forecast [errors] since the OBR was established [in 2010]”, and pledged to investigate these thoroughly.</p> <p>Its “tentative” conclusion was that the main mistake it made was to take the Treasury's emergency “allocations” of money to government departments last year as an indication of likely expenditure when, in fact, the exchequer kept a tight control of the cash. Not all of it was spent by departments.</p> <p>As a result, the OBR now thinks that on a like-for-like basis it overestimated central government borrowing by up to £35bn in 2020-21. With the OBR having made similar assumptions about money allocated by the Treasury to Whitehall departments in 2021-22, the watchdog is likely to revise down spending and therefore borrowing for this year. </p> <p>The second OBR error was partly bad luck in producing an economic forecast for the March Budget in January and February, when the evidence of a rebound was getting stronger day by day. The watchdog's 4 per cent growth forecast for 2021 now appears almost absurdly low, with private sector predictions this month closer to 8 per cent. </p> <p>Steffan Ball, economist at Goldman Sachs, raised his 2021 growth forecast last week to 8.1 per cent, saying hard data and news flow “has been very encouraging lately”. </p> <p>The outlook for 2021 — with widespread Covid-19 vaccine availability and the economy on course to return to its pre-pandemic size by the end of the year — is tracking the OBR's optimistic scenario for growth contained in its March Budget document much more closely than its central forecast. </p> <p>In the first three months of this year, the OBR expected a contraction of 3.8 per cent in the central forecast, but actual growth was only -1.5 per cent, and the economy entered the second quarter with significant momentum. </p> <p>This momentum is highlighted by the OBR's Budget forecast errors for March. As Sunak was outlining major tax rises in his Budget to start to pay for the costs of the pandemic, the fiscal watchdog thought the size of the economy was still 10 per cent below the pre-pandemic level in January 2020. The latest official data show the shortfall of output was 6.2 per cent. </p> <p>With the economy performing almost as strongly as the OBR's optimistic scenario, the public finances are also set to track that improvement. The OBR said in its central forecast that it expected borrowing of 10.3 per cent of gross domestic product in 2021-22, or about £233.9bn, but only 4.4 per cent in the optimistic scenario, about £100bn. </p> <p>The cash level of national income, which is most important in determining tax revenues, is still a little bit further behind the optimistic scenario than real output, but FT analysis of its likely path suggests the UK is on course to record a deficit of no higher £150bn in 2021-22.</p> <p>Sunak is likely to worry, however, that a rapid recovery will not necessarily translate into better longer term public finances because there may be deep economic scars from the pandemic.</p> <p>But economists are becoming much more optimistic on this issue. Martin Beck, economist at Oxford Economics, said: “The apparent speed at which demand for workers is returning and employees are getting back to work offers some hope that Covid's long-run economic damage may prove smaller than feared.”</p> <p>Instead of the OBR's assumption of 3 per cent long-term damage to the economy, the Bank of England this month cut its estimate to 1.25 per cent. </p> <p>In a statement, the OBR said “there was a lot of uncertainty” about the outlook at the time of the [March] Budget, but added that it was “too early to draw any firm conclusions [about scarring] at this stage”. It said it would review all its assumptions in its next forecast.</p> <p>Robert Wood, economist at Bank of America, said with the government's furlough scheme likely to keep the peak of unemployment close to 5.5 per cent, he was “cutting [his] longer-term scarring” assumption at the same time as raising his growth forecast. </p> <p>The Treasury said there were now “positive economic signs” but the outlook was still uncertain and it was important “to get the public finances back on a more sustainable footing”.</p><p>Source: Chris Giles in London 2021 'Sunak ready to reap windfall from economic rebound' FT.com 21 May.
