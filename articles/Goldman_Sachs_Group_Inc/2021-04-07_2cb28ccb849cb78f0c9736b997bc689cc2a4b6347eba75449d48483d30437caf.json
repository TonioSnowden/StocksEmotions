Get in touch with us anytime:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:Due.Diligence@ft.com\">Due.Diligence@ft.com</a><strong>.</strong></p> <h2>Credit Suisse: damage control</h2> <p>Last week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a6be4fc-5102-4bd2-9bf3-f27dd9957c6f\">DD recommended a major spring cleaning</a> at <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>. It appears the Swiss bank, which is dealing with the consequences of the implosion of <strong>Greensill Capital</strong> and <strong>Bill Hwang</strong>'s <strong>Archegos</strong>, received the message.&#xa0;</p> <p>On Tuesday Credit Suisse <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c10d0b81-f2ef-48c3-8e9c-17419f4af21b\">brought out the big mops</a> for a major clean-up.&#xa0;</p> <p>And it'll need them — the Swiss bank revealed it stands to lose $4.7bn from the Archegos fiasco, higher than <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/073509cd-fe45-44d2-afac-cace611b6900\">earlier estimates</a>. That would push the bank to a first-quarter loss of about SFr900m ($960m).</p> <p>In a dramatic reshuffling, at least seven senior executives, traders and risk managers were shown the door, as others' bonuses were revoked and investigations were launched into the events leading up to losses gleaned from the Archegos and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c55d39b7-341c-482d-9640-c168b08073bf\">Greensill</a> sagas.</p> <p>It's worth pointing out here that Credit Suisse has tumbled through a spin-cycle of scandals over the past six years or so: a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab60029c-6df1-11ea-89df-41bea055720b\">corporate spying debacle</a> and entanglements in the <strong>Luckin Coffee</strong> and <strong>Wirecard</strong> frauds to name just a few.&#xa0;</p> <p>But this was a pretty dramatic executive clear-out. Here's a list of the departures we know about:</p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Lara Warner</strong>, chief risk and compliance officer;&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Brian Chin</strong>, head of the investment bank;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Paul Galietto</strong>, head of equities trading;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Parshu Shah</strong>, head of prime service risk;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Ryan Atkinson</strong>, head of credit risk at the investment bank;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Ilana Ash</strong>, head of counterparty credit risk management;</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Manish Mehta</strong>, head of counterparty hedge fund risk.</p></li> </ul> <p>And here are the other measures Credit Suisse is taking:</p> <ul>  <li><p>senior executives have had their bonuses for the year withdrawn, while outgoing chair <strong>Urs Rohner</strong> waived his SFr1.5m chair fee after facing criticism over his unchanged total pay of SFr4.7m for the year;</p></li>  <li><p>the bank has suspended its SFr1.5bn share buyback programme and cut its dividend by two-thirds to SFr0.10 a share;</p></li>  <li><p>two investigations by external parties will be launched into the events leading up to the Archegos and Greensill losses.</p></li> </ul> <p>Perhaps chief executive <strong>Thomas Gottstein</strong> will get the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47471301-2898-4144-9882-475dcf4030ab\">“clean slate”</a> he's been hoping for, after all.</p> <p>However, the last time he rolled out changes, things didn't exactly go as planned. In an effort to iron out the kinks last summer, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab81c3b6-ff76-4c99-9761-7f28f1e52383\">he combined</a> the bank's risk and compliance divisions.&#xa0;</p> <p>That put both Warner, then the bank's chief risk officer, in a higher position of power, while Chin, then head of global markets, was promoted to head up investment banking.&#xa0;</p> <p>It makes sense why, this time, the overhaul measures have been far more sweeping.</p> <h2>‘A trading relationship does not exist': a tale of Sanjeev Gupta's invoices&#xa0;</h2> <p>The last time DD <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/61b8b1d0-ae6f-4e74-8a2a-1123be64e2b2\">checked in</a> on the fast-paced drama that is Greensill Capital's unravelling, it was with tales of founder <strong>Lex Greensill </strong>telling <strong>Masayoshi Son</strong>, <strong>Rajeev Misra</strong> and a group of wealthy executives about his private jet collection — and camping in the desert with <strong>David Cameron</strong> and <strong>Mohammed bin Salman</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Since then, the focus of the story has shifted decisively towards its other main character, the commodities trader-turned “saviour of steel” <strong>Sanjeev Gupta</strong>.</p> <p>Greensill lent billions to companies in Gupta's <strong>GFG Alliance</strong> group on the basis of invoices from his customers. Now <strong>Grant Thornton</strong>, Greensill's administrator, has tried to verify some of the invoices underpinning those loans — and it can't.&#xa0;</p> <p>In fact, some of the companies listed on the documents said they had not done business with Gupta's companies.&#xa0;</p> <p>“We know them, but a trading relationship between us does not exist,” said <strong>Winfried Winterhager</strong>, manager at <strong>RPS Siegen GmbH</strong>, a German scrap metals business.&#xa0;</p> <p>Read the full story from the FT's Cynthia O'Murchu and DD's Rob Smith <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe234f59-75b9-44f7-af8a-f05e588957b7\">here</a>. Gupta later told the FT that RPS Siegen had only been “identified as a potential customer”, and financing was provided on that basis.&#xa0;</p> <p>Gupta has said his companies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7fd7673-e4de-402d-acec-5aea358ee461\">don't immediately owe</a> any money to Greensill. Meanwhile, his group has been hit with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05254a12-3d00-4148-854b-08298ea440e3\">applications</a> for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05254a12-3d00-4148-854b-08298ea440e3\">winding-up o</a>r<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05254a12-3d00-4148-854b-08298ea440e3\">ders</a> from creditors, DD's Kaye Wiggins, Rob, and the FT's Owen Walker and Stephen Morris reported.</p> <p>And in the latest sign of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/df33022a-285d-4cdb-8b26-cca2e7fc3fd4\">financial strains</a> facing Gupta's empire, his eastern Europe steel plants are under pressure to secure more than €100m to meet a carbon bill.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now that you're up to speed, brace for the FT's latest finding: a <strong>Liberty House</strong> email address (that's Gupta's commodities trading and industrial group) was used to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1263219-b0f9-4484-a21e-7f489b2eeb35\">register web domains</a> that closely resembled those of other trading houses including <strong>Gunvor</strong>, <strong>Concord Resources</strong> and <strong>Salzgitter Mannesmann</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>Concord's chief executive <strong>Mark Hansen</strong> said it would send a cease and desist letter to Liberty House over the registration of <strong>concordresources.net</strong>. The Liberty House email address was also used to register dozens of web domains for companies that the steel tycoon has insisted are independent.</p> <p>Where is Gupta as this unfolds? He's podcasting, of course. “What I can say for certain is that GFG did not break any rules,” he said on a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c024eb75-70d3-48c3-bacc-970309c3f840\">podcast</a> aimed at GFG employees.</p> <p>We told you a few weeks ago how former UK prime minister <strong>David Cameron</strong> had been avoiding the FT's questions on Greensill. Well, now Guardian columnist <strong>Marina Hyde </strong>is on the case with an excoriating take.
