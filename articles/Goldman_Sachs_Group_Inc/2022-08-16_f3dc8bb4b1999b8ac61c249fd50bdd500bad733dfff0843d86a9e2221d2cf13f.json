  "text": "<p>After decades of building fantasy worlds in video games, the heirs of Nintendo's founding family are deploying their $1.5bn war chest for a completely different mission: to rebuild planet earth. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/7c5218a0-3755-463e-abbc-1a1632cfd1da\">Nintendo</a>'s family office burst on to Tokyo's financial scene in April with a surprise buyout proposal for a 93-year-old marine engineering company called Toyo Construction, in which it had built a 27 per cent stake via funds registered in the Cayman Islands.</p> <p>A heated public battle unfolded as Toyo Construction tried to sell itself at a lower price to a rival and made a failed attempt to install a poison pill to block the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/02d551a4-94a6-4783-8ea9-8aa982cb1225\">Nintendo </a>family's bid. </p> <p>The continuing stand-off has turned the spotlight on Yamauchi No 10 family office, which lays out its investment vision on a quirky <a href=\"https://y-n10.com/\">homepage</a> designed like a video game. There, accompanied by a gaming tune, it promises to invest the wealth built from Nintendo's rich portfolio of franchises including <em>Donkey Kong</em>, <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>Legend of Zelda</em> “in the future of the children of the world”.</p> <p>The office was launched in 2020 by Banjo Yamauchi, the grandson of former Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi, who transformed the Kyoto-based company from a maker of playing cards into a global gaming titan behind the Switch console. </p> <p>Using the Nintendo family's wealth, the office manages nearly ¥200bn ($1.5bn) in assets and its investment returns are used to finance philanthropic activities and efforts to help start-ups. </p> <p>“We want to actively invest in people who are defying common sense to tackle profound global challenges” for society, Hirowaka Murakami, a former Goldman Sachs banker and chief investment officer of the family office, said in an interview.</p> <p>Murakami said Toyo Construction's maritime technology could be used for making the ocean cleaner and sustainable. The company is one of dozens backed by the family office with businesses that have the potential to transform into next-generation technology. </p> <p>“The company [Toyo Construction] will need to shift from public works projects to selling its technology globally in the private sector, and that's what we want to help them with,” Murakami said.</p> <p>The office's proposal to buy Toyo Construction at ¥1,000 per share — 30 per cent higher than the rival offer by Infroneer — and its plans to improve its performance have raised questions over whether it is acting like an activist investor. </p> <p>But the office has ruled out going directly to Toyo's shareholders with a hostile bid, saying it was focused on reaching a deal through dialogue. </p> <p>Toyo Construction has criticised the office for what it describes as a “strong-armed approach”, but in June the family office was forced to abandon its plans for a shareholder vote on anti-takeover measures. </p> <p>“We don't consider ourselves at all as activists,” Murakami said. “Some people might say we are a private equity fund . . . others may say we are venture capitalists but we don't care about the approach. We just want to create value together. The returns will follow only when that value is created.”</p> <p>The office has also invested in start-ups such as Astroscale, which is working on removing space debris, and Chicago-based company Nature's Fynd, which makes protein using microbes found in the volcanic springs of Yellowstone National Park.</p><p>Source: Kana Inagaki and Leo Lewis in Tokyo 2022 'Battle over engineering company turns spotlight on Nintendo's family office' FT.com 16 August.
