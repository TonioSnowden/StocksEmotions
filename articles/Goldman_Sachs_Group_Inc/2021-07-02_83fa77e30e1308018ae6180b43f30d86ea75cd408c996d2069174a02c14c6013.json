Take our </em><a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/quiz/firstft-2021-07-02/\"><em>quiz</em></a><em>.</em><br>Donald Trump's family business and its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, have been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/accadd14-8829-4a17-b13d-41382efa0de7\">charged with criminal fraud</a> by New York prosecutors.</p> <p>The charges were laid out in a 15-count indictment unsealed in a Manhattan court yesterday, marking a decisive turn in an almost three-year investigation of Trump's business by Cyrus Vance, the Manhattan district attorney, in tandem with New York state attorney-general Letitia James.</p> <p>They allege that Weisselberg and other top Trump Organization executives arranged to conceal part of their income from the government by having the company pay their rent, tuition, car leases and other “off the books” benefits that were never reported to tax authorities.</p> <p>Weisselberg, 73, who surrendered to authorities early yesterday morning, was led into a crowded courtroom in handcuffs hours later, where he entered a plea of not guilty during a brief arraignment hearing. His lawyer said he would “fight these charges”.</p> <h1>Six more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>2.

The share pledges were made to banks including UBS, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs, according to documents seen by the Financial Times.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>2.

Here are its <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/6b219b78-97c8-4c24-b11c-0b7be63e970b\">five most revealing numbers</a>.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>US Supreme Court upholds Arizona voting laws </strong>In a 6-3 decision, Supreme Court justices <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/35e67872-e1eb-449d-8745-3d0c13db1526\">upheld two Arizona voting laws </a>that opponents said discriminated against racial minorities. The decision may make it more difficult to bring challenges to voting restrictions being enacted in states across the US.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>HK police officer stabbed as city marks Communist party anniversary</strong> A Hong Kong man died after stabbing a police officer and then himself in a case the city's security chief described as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6a56bbd8-8ac9-4ca4-a460-4b165e75651c\">“a lone wolf terrorist attack”</a>. The attack, on the day China's Communist party marked the centenary of its founding, left the police officer in a serious condition. Chinese stocks, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1bcea4b-6963-4a1a-8e79-dbdffb35a03f\">suffered their worst day</a> in three months. </p> <p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Richard Branson poised to beat Jeff Bezos into space</strong> Sir Richard Branson has vowed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7fd770c-4dae-4c9b-9ac7-4a6a4468e4b6\">to beat Jeff Bezos to space</a>, confirming plans to bring forward his first trip aboard a Virgin Galactic spaceship to July 11. Meanwhile, Bezos's space company Blue Origin announced yesterday that 82-year-old Wally Funk would be accompanying the Amazon founder, his brother and an as yet unidentified individual on their July 20 flight. </p> <h1>Coronavirus digest</h1> <ul>  <li><p>The <strong>EU</strong> has launched <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7d48a006-cdfa-4b27-a663-21428471fbc5\">a new app</a> that will allow citizens who have proof of vaccination, a negative Covid-19 test or can show recovery from the virus, to travel across the 27-member states. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Lambda</strong>, the Covid-19 variant which was first detected in Peru and has spread to 27 countries, is <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/b3ea5177-9312-418b-acb7-af16a3bdcd22\">worrying officials in Latin America</a> because of its “unusual” set of mutations.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Indonesia</strong> is set to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d4b737b4-1575-456f-b21c-80d344bc43f7\">tighten distancing measures</a> to counter record numbers of Covid-19 cases, as experts warn the country is on the brink of a “catastrophe”.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>For the latest coronavirus news, </em><a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/Bn_05I94SXxMfWJ34_Oxug~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRiiiIsP0R_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL25ld3NsZXR0ZXJzaWdudXAtY29yb25hdmlydXM_ZW1haWxJZD02MGE3OTU4MTJlYTM2YzAwMDQ4MjI4YWYmc2VnbWVudElkPTEzYjdlMzQxLWVkMDItMmI1My1lOGMwLWQ5Y2I1OWJlOGIzYlcIZmludGltZXNCCmClP52nYEs8IIFSFmplbm5pZmVyLmNyZWVyeUBmdC5jb21YBAAAAAA~\"><em>sign up</em></a><em> for our </em><a href=\"https://click.newsletters.ft.com/f/a/vGeTqXq8zydeDye-jHuWDQ~~/AAAAAQA~/RgRiiiIsP0R-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2Nvcm9uYXZpcnVzLWJ1c2luZXNzLXVwZGF0ZT9lbWFpbElkPTYwYTc5NTgxMmVhMzZjMDAwNDgyMjhhZiZzZWdtZW50SWQ9MTNiN2UzNDEtZWQwMi0yYjUzLWU4YzAtZDljYjU5YmU4YjNiVwhmaW50aW1lc0IKYKU_nadgSzwggVIWamVubmlmZXIuY3JlZXJ5QGZ0LmNvbVgEAAAAAA~~\"><em>Coronavirus Business Update</em></a> <em>newsletter.</em></p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>US employment data </strong>US job gains are set to pick up <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5968f24-ab9a-48e4-b181-5e719d812705\">in June</a>, as the world's largest economy continues to heal from the Covid-19 shock and hiring catches up with the unrelenting demand for workers.

The causes are well-rehearsed: richer workers saving money at home have been attracted by properties with a lot more outdoor space. Central bankers have played a role by lowering interest rates and buying up assets in a bid to keep financial markets functioning and workers employed. But ultimately governments must take responsibility for solving <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ca4561a-4c15-48ec-b6bf-90cea4940ee1\">the housing puzzle</a>, writes the FT's editorial board. </p> <p><strong>Britain's private schools lose their grip on Oxbridge </strong>The anger of wealthy, mostly white parents about losing the advantages they expected to be able to buy their children <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bbb7fe58-0908-4f8e-bb1a-081a42a045b7\">by sending them to the top schools</a> is part of a broader pattern of status anxiety among some sections of the British and American upper classes. It is out of step with reality, writes Brooke Masters.</p> <p><strong>‘Home in the World' by Amartya Sen — citizen of everywhere </strong>The economist and human rights campaigner <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2a4096b4-4fef-4d6e-bd14-e30cff8426e1\">spoke with the FT's Edward Luce</a> about his new book, his early life and his long battle for a fairer world. At 87, Sen's mind remains as sharp as when he won the Nobel memorial prize in economics in 1998. But his body is painfully frail.</p> <p><strong>It feels lonelier at the top with everyone working from home</strong> Bob, the imaginary chief executive of Global Cryptobank<em>, </em>driven to distraction by his empty office, writes in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6ba4621-d2c1-4140-96e1-e6cfc29806e2\">all-staff memo</a>: “I have started to wonder what is the point of my job.”</p> <p><strong>FT Film: How the 20-year war changed Afghanistan</strong> An Afghan photojournalist, former politician, young musician, Nato interpreter, female film-maker, and a student whose mother was assassinated, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/7d024732-525b-4553-9f27-128391dcf114\">reveal the impact of war</a> . . . as US troops pull out and the Taliban gains ground.</p> <h1>Q&amp;A: the Chinese Communist party at 100</h1> <p><em>Xi Jinping marked the centennial of the </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a03e5a0-203f-41a0-b3bc-73a17a29c7cd\"><em>Chinese Communist party</em></a><em>'s founding yesterday with a nationalistic address in Beijing.</em> <em>Ahead of the&#xa0;anniversary, James Kynge, the FT's global China editor, wrote about the party's longtime struggle to&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b3a7274-8fac-403e-a385-3f8920f5b369\"><em>reconcile growth and stability</em></a><em>. We asked him a few questions about the deeper meaning of the centenary.</em></p> <p><strong>What's the significance of the 100th anniversary of the party for President Xi Jinping?&#xa0;<br></strong>For Xi personally, this represents a public affirmation of his rule and that of the Chinese Communist party, which he leads. These set-piece events may appear stilted to the west but in China they play very well. Reactions to a huge parade in central Beijing in 2019 to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China was greeted by Chinese inside the country and overseas with a surge of genuine pride.</p> <p><strong>How is Xi using the centenary to shape China's image at home and internationally?</strong>&#xa0;<br>Defiance. Nationalism. Pride. These are the emotions that Xi knows will stir the crowds and they were the touchstones for his speech in Tiananmen Square on Thursday. He warned foreigners that any infringements on China's sovereignty would be met by a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a03e5a0-203f-41a0-b3bc-73a17a29c7cd\">“great wall of steel”</a>. He added that China would not tolerate “sanctimonious preaching” from outsiders. He said unification with Taiwan remained an “unshakeable commitment” of the CCP.</p> <p><strong>What will the CCP's biggest challenges be in the next 100 years?<br></strong>One obvious one will be the succession after Xi. He shows no sign of grooming a successor and has abolished presidential term limits, setting himself up to rule until he dies. Another challenge will be making good on China's territorial ambitions — taking over Taiwan, by force if necessary — and enforcing its claims to most of the South China Sea and a series of disputed territories. Suppressing free speech among a 400m-strong middle class will also require constant attention.</p> <p><em>Read more of our China coverage on </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/world/asia-pacific/china\"><em>FT.com</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Jennifer Creery and Emily Goldberg 2021 'FirstFT: Trump Organization and top executive charged with fraud' FT.com 2 July.
