  "title": "Goldman  Names Big  Class of  Managers  ----  By Orla McCaffrey",
  "text": "<p>    Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Tuesday named its largest-ever class of managing directors, the final role before a coveted partnership. </p><p>   The Wall Street bank promoted 643 employees to managing directors, a 38% increase from the previous selection in 2019. New classes of managing directors and partners are chosen in alternating years. </p><p>   Goldman named just 465 new managing directors two years ago, part of a bid to cut costs and renew the luster of its highest ranks. </p><p>   The bank said the much-bigger 2021 class reflects the firm's rising head count and investments in its asset-management and consumer arms. Goldman has about 43,000 employees, up from 37,800 two years ago. </p><p>   New managing directors are granted access to the bank's leadership-training program, private investment funds and a personal wealth adviser. </p><p>   About 11% of the newly minted directors are based in areas the firm has identified as strategic locations, including Salt Lake City, Dallas and Bengaluru, India. </p><p>   Goldman said the class is the most diverse in its history. It includes 30% women, up slightly from 29% in 2019. Close to 5% of the promoted directors are Black, up from 4% in 2019. </p><p>   Goldman last month reported a big jump in third-quarter earnings, fueled by deal making. </p><p></p>",
