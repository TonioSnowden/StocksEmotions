  "text": "<p>\n  [Financial Analysis and Commentary] </p><pre> </pre><p>\n  Bond traders may no longer be masters of the universe, but they could still be heroes for Wall Street. </p><p>\n  For several years following the 2008 financial crisis, the business of fixed income, currency and commodity trading was a worry for banks. It seemed to be in a long decline from its precrisis days and many wondered if it would ever rebound from changes in regulations and banks' risk appetite. Lately, though, the FICC business has been the star performer for Wall Street, helping to offset a big decline in deal-making activity. </p><p>\n  It now seems this business was underestimated during the long postcrisis period, weighed down as it was by steady and ultralow interest rates. The convulsions of 2020 led to a surge in the industry's fixed-income revenue pool of more than 40%, according to Coalition Greenwich. That dropped back a bit in 2021, though it was still quite elevated over recent prepandemic years. </p><p>\n  Now the most recent volatility in commodity prices, rates and currencies is sparking another jump: FICC trading revenue was up more than 35% on average across the big five Wall Street investment banks in the second quarter from a year ago. This helped to partly offset a large decline in mergers and equity and debt issuance, which was hampered by some of the same volatility. </p><p>\n  Goldman Sachs said Monday its FICC revenue was up 55% from a year earlier to $3.6 billion in the second quarter. Investment-banking revenue was down 41% to $2.1 billion and, within that, equity underwriting revenue plummeted 89%. Goldman's overall net profit fell 47% year-over-year in the quarter, yet annualized return on equity for the period was still a respectable 10.6%. </p><p>\n  These are signs of a well-diversified institution that can withstand upheavals in some business lines by drawing on strength in others. Goldman shares rose 2.5%, or $7.39, on Monday, closing at $301.26, as net profit came in ahead of expectations. </p><p>\n  The question for fixed-income trading going forward might be whether banks are able to keep providing the raw material -- balance sheet -- to take advantage of market opportunities. Following a stress test that raised capital requirements for some of the biggest banks, many have aimed to pare down their risk-weighted assets in the second quarter. That resource management could hinder further growth as banks eye other uses for capital, notably share buybacks at low stock multiples. </p><p>\n  Yet big swings in global markets show no signs of abating. Just since the end of the second quarter, for instance, the euro has fallen below parity with the dollar and the yen has continued its sharp decline. Moves like these are likely to drive continued trading activity, not just from speculators but also big multinational companies trying to hedge risks. Citigroup last week reported a two-thirds year-over-year jump in rates-and-currencies trading for the second quarter, noting that market volatility drove \"corporate clients in particular to be more active in risk management.\" Chief Executive Jane Fraser also said that \"we were more efficient in our capital usage\" in the bank's markets unit. </p><p>\n  Of course, volatility like this has also historically carried the potential to catch a bank wrong-footed. That has long justified discounted valuations relative to other sectors. But banks are hardly expensive right now, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index down 21% year to date. If the biggest Wall Street institutions can manage the impressive feat of tamping down risky assets while generating more trading revenue, they deserve a second look from investors. </p><p></p>",
