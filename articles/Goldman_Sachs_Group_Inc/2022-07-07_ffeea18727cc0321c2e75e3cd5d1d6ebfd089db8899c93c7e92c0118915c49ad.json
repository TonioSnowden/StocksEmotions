  "title": "Banking & Finance:  Firm to Verify  ESG Claims by  Money Managers  ----  By Matt Wirz",
  "text": "<p>   Financial-crimes advisory firm K2 Integrity Holdings Inc. is launching an anti-greenwashing certification for investment firms as regulators crack down on false claims about investment products by money managers. </p><p>   The certification is meant to verify that the firms deliver on the environmental, social and governance targets they advertise to individuals, pensions and other investors. K2 will use disclosures from the companies they analyze and its own investigators' research, according to a product presentation reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. </p><p>   Few of K2's competitors offer similar accreditation, for which fund managers would pay the firm much like they already do for credit ratings and audits. Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel and Ernst &amp; Young are contributing legal and auditing advice, respectively, to the product. </p><p>   Sustainable investment offerings surged over the past five years as investors looked to put their savings to work toward goals like carbon-emissions reduction and improved access to healthcare, in addition to generating financial returns. </p><p>   Wall Street cashed in on the trend, but concerns emerged about misleading practices, ranging from ESG stock funds that invest in oil-and-gas companies to so-called green bonds issued by borrowers with mixed environmental records. </p><p>   \"There is an enormous amount of backlash coming at ESG funds both from the political left and the political right,\" said Todd Cort, the faculty co-director of Yale University's Center for Business and Environment, who advised K2 on the certification. \"The idea of the certification is a timely one.\" </p><p>   The Securities and Exchange Commission in May proposed new rules governing how asset managers market ESG products and requiring more extensive disclosures. Those rules followed a similar move by the European Union last year. Meanwhile, the SEC is investigating the investment arms of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG over some of their ESG funds. </p><p>   K2's co-Chief Executive Andrew Rabinowitz has sought to benefit from the regulatory shift since he joined the firm a year ago from hedge-fund manager Marathon Asset Management. </p><p>   If K2's ESG certification takes hold in the investment business, the company would offer it to sports franchises, and then banks, said Mr. Rabinowitz, who runs K2 with co-CEO Jeremy Kroll. </p><p>   Credit rating firm Moody's Corp. launched a data product last year through its ESG Solutions unit to help investment firms meet European disclosure requirements but doesn't offer certifications, a Moody's spokesman said. S&amp;P Global Ratings, Moody's largest competitor, also doesn't make ESG fund certifications, a company spokesman said. </p><p>   There is no standard definition of what constitutes an ESG investment. K2 proposes to verify that money managers have set proper ESG targets for their overall businesses and the funds they offer and that they are hitting those targets. </p><p>   The product takes a \"trust-but-verify\" approach, combining self-disclosed information from participating companies with research conducted by K2 staff, according to Mr. Rabinowitz. </p><p></p>",
