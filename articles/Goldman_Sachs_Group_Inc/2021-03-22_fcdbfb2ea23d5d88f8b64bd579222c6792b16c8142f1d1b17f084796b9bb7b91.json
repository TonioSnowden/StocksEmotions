Time lags, difficulties in collecting data, distorting effects of emergency policies and forced changes in business models and personal consumption all add to the confusion.&#xa0;</p> <p>Unemployment is a good example. The US labour market, where workers are laid off with generous benefits, looks much more volatile than the European model where furlough schemes allow workers to stay on the books, although the underlying problems in both are the same.&#xa0;</p> <p>Alternative real-time indicators of the kind measured by the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/272354f2-f970-4ae4-a8ae-848c4baf8f4a\">global impact tracker</a> — such as café and restaurant visits, cinema box office revenues, and flight and hotel bookings — have become more popular, but even high-profile attempts such as <a href=\"https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/\">Google's mobility reports</a> have been found wanting as populations across the world adapt to lockdowns.&#xa0;</p> <p>Forecasts are even more problematic. The emergence of new variants of coronavirus and unforeseen shortages of vaccines have upended assumptions about ending lockdowns, especially in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e818cea3-998f-4eef-ac0f-8f11894ac9af\">Europe</a>, where the economic outlook is now darkening and another “lost summer” is a real possibility.&#xa0; </p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p>The spat between the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/254fc733-1568-4ea7-9fdf-069285c7f9c1\">UK and the EU</a> over <strong>Oxford/AstraZeneca's</strong> vaccine, which was boosted today by positive <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7aa7f2cc-01ae-48c3-b3bf-6dee68f4d3e6\">trial results</a> from the US, continues ahead of an EU summit on Thursday. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/43b95016-7bee-4f17-b2b2-ea7efa9bcec2\">Russia</a> is also at odds with Brussels over the latter's declaration that it did not need its Sputnik jab, as is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f0e74ab5-63ed-478d-bbf6-aea7590eba95\">Austria</a>, which has been excluded from EU plans for reallocating vaccines. Here's our <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53629923-47c9-4047-8022-031010d39e18\">Big Read</a> on the EU's vaccine blunders.</p> <p>Some 900,000 of the world's 1.7m <strong>seafarers</strong> are from developing countries where vaccination may be as far away as 2024, threatening to deepen the global <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72feaabd-5f94-40ad-9073-0178db969b23\">supply chain crisis</a>. Ships could be denied entry to ports but there is no easy way to secure vaccination when the world lacks a globally-approved jab. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41b517c6-5279-4547-a882-8d4d7d615899\">FT analysis</a> of <strong>Britain's “new normal”</strong> shows the changing pattern of office life, commuting and online activity as well as Britons' state of mind: happiness and life satisfaction are both on the rise. </p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>The big <strong>law and advisory firms</strong> face the departure of many junior staff who have suffered from the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f037991e-4481-4641-8186-0862f1f07c97\">mental health</a> toll of long hours and isolation as company restructurings and deals increased workloads during the pandemic. Some Goldman Sachs first-year staff said they were suffering from insomnia and anxiety after working 95-hour weeks. </p> <p>Shares in <strong>travel companies</strong> fell as the UK indicated that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/06553a27-3978-4d51-91e8-3004fa116ca2\">summer getaways </a>may now be off the cards because of rising coronavirus infections in Europe. Business and ministers have been working on a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9817c71-9f22-4e00-91b0-fb7e95e6cf06\">“traffic light”</a> plan that may allow travel to certain destinations. Columnist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81e972f1-65ac-4180-8ef2-cdaf35000dd9\">Michael Skapinker</a> outlines the things we'll miss if we cut business travel. </p> <p>Pubs and restaurants in England are busy preparing <strong>outdoor facilities</strong> in time for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f08fb1a9-6cf7-4b3d-8dec-010e0ee4ee66\">lockdown restrictions</a> easing on April 12 at an average cost (for a pub) of about £4,000 to £5,000. While in the US, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10a8ada7-6d1b-448c-8f3e-07d4bf4ca42e#post-c39b1f8e-72d6-4155-bec1-1d24ca89821f\">“Chicago Alfresco”</a> is a project offering grants of up to $250,000 for “public way enhancement” to improve outdoor community spaces.</p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p>Investor optimism over the rise in <strong>oil prices</strong> has helped low-rated <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03173caa-2622-4e68-bbaf-b6e56d856042\">US energy companies</a> raise a record $20bn in bond markets so far this year, helping many avoid bankruptcy. In a sign of confidence fuelled by vaccines, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b91097a9-c554-4e5c-9b89-a8abec354a55\">Saudi Aramco</a> is keeping its $75bn dividend promise despite a 44 per cent plunge in 2020 profits. </p> <p>The latest in our Charts that Matter series shows investors have put $170bn into <strong>equity funds</strong> over the past month, the largest amount on record, as confidence about the US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88ab1525-02d3-4cf7-83ef-cfc00322d2b3\">economic outlook</a> grows.</p> <p>Global investors are sticking with <strong>US equities</strong> thanks to a resilient dollar and prospects of strong earnings growth as well as brightening economic prospects, writes US investment editor <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1510faa2-5b62-4651-9d46-2f4b106ced32\">Michael Mackenzie</a>.</p> <h2>FT Weekend Festival</h2> <p>Catch up on a huge range of sessions featuring everyone from former Bank of England chief Mark Carney to fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg and music director Simon Rattle via <a href=\"https://ftweekend.live.ft.com/page/1658715/video-on-demand\">video on demand</a>.</p> <h2>Have your say</h2> <p>Alpine Hermit comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3cbc04da-5345-4a0a-811d-abd5557b6590?commentID=2e82e3ca-f12d-4224-90ff-bf45185e81da\">Etihad's Tony Douglas: ‘Don't fight the storm'</a></p> <blockquote>  <p>I would have thought that such a large aircraft [A380] would accommodate the social distancing people now want in this Covid world, rather than packing them all together like sardines in a tin for hours on end. Airlines getting rid of A380s and 747s is very premature in my opinion. Selling space would attract many more people back to flying. Of course this will push up the ticket prices, but I personally won't fly again if I'm pressed up against another stranger, and especially since I can do 90+ per cent of my business over Webex and Teams — I now have a distinct choice.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p>“Music allowed us a triumphal gesture of survival against the virus, and reminds us of our place in the great dance of life.” Musicologist <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/523b245c-d818-4921-b795-2b81f4bd44ba\">Michael Spitzer travels back</a> 40,000 years and beyond to find the origins of music and the role it played in human development.</p> <p><em>We would really like to hear from you.
