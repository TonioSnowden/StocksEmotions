  "title": "Russia's Natural-Gas Game Comes With Economic Risks; High energy prices have swollen Russia's coffers for now, but any loss of European gas revenues in years to come will be hard to replace",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Putin, meanwhile, has raised the possibility of further sanctions-related cuts to flows as soon as next week. European officials have called the threat political blackmail, part of what they say is a long history of Russia using gas as a weapon.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Do you expect Russia to weaponize natural-gas exports? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.</p><p>The gas relationship goes both ways: Russia gets hundreds of millions of dollars a day from its gas sales to Europe, which is one of its biggest, longest-term customers. In the short term, though, Russia isn't as reliant on that revenue stream thanks to its much larger sales of crude oil and other commodities around the world.</p><p>Surging commodity prices have contributed to Russia's record $70 billion current account surplus, a broad measure of trade and other international transactions, in the second quarter of this year, according to UBS Wealth Management.</p><p>Oil is a bigger tax earner for Moscow than gas. It accounted for some 30% of tax revenues in the first four months of this year, according to economists at Barclays. Gas' share was 12%.</p><p>That gives Russia a buffer even if it was to completely cut off flows to Europe. \"A full halt of gas deliveries to Western Europe would be manageable for Russia,\" Barclays wrote in a recent note to clients.</p><p>Longer term, though, the economic risks are much greater, analysts say. Kremlin-controlled exporter Gazprom PJSC has already had to throttle production this year, partly because of the lower gas volumes to Europe. Its options to reroute the flows to Asia or other markets are limited by its traditionally Westward-facing infrastructure. A gas pipeline to China opened in 2019, but it can't handle much gas.</p><p>A second one is currently under negotiations with Beijing but won't be ready for years. Western sanctions would also prevent Russia from building and maintaining some of the needed export infrastructure, including pipelines and turbines, analysts said.</p><p>Russia has been injecting more gas into storage sites and shutting some production, analysts said. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs, Gazprom's production is down more than 35% year-over-year for the first half of July.</p><p>With storage filling up fast, more wells might need to be closed, many of which will be difficult to reopen. The productivity of wells can be sensitive to pressure changes that can be unpredictable. Stopping and starting wells risks upsetting the delicate geological balance of a well-performing field.</p><p>\"Some gas-producing wells will have to be terminated, either shut down forever if they are insufficiently productive or switched to a periodic operational regime,\" said Mikhail Krutikhin, an independent energy consultant.</p><p>And while oil matters more for the budget overall, Gazprom's Europe revenues have traditionally gone toward subsidizing energy bills for Russia's economy and for the general population.</p><p>With gas flows to Europe reduced and few other ways to export it, Gazprom also would have little incentive to invest in additional gas production for the foreseeable future because it would be hard to sell it, said Janis Kluge, an expert in the Russian economy at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. This means less work for service and construction companies in Russia's energy industry in the coming years. That's especially the case in the northern region of Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, where a lot of the gas earmarked for Europe comes from, he said.</p><p>\"At the moment, Russia can do without Gazprom's export revenues, because it still has plenty of cash from exporting oil,\" said Mr. Kluge. \"But this is only the short term.\"</p><p>Write to Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com and Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com</p><p>Russia's Natural-Gas Game Comes With Economic Risks</p>",
