  "title": "Derby's Take: Russia's War on Ukraine Clouds Outlook for Dissent at Fed Meeting; Most officials seem on board with a quarter-percentage-point interest rate increase",
  "text": "<p>Most Fed officials seem on board with his call. In late February, New York Fed chief John Williams, for instance, also leaned against a big start to what will likely be a series of rate rises. \"I expect it will be appropriate to raise the target range at our upcoming meeting in March,\" Mr. Williams said, adding that \"I don't see any compelling argument to take a big step at the beginning.\"</p><p>The main reason for raising rates is that the U.S. economy is booking strong growth and very low unemployment amid a surge in inflation to levels not seen in four decades. The degree of inflation facing the Fed is such that it has been fueling a debate among policy makers as to whether an aggressive rate increase would be in order when they meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p><p>Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, along with St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, had expressed some interest in starting off with a half-percentage-point increase, a bold move that hasn't been part of the Fed's playbook for some time.</p><p>Dissents by Fed governors are rare. The last time one voted against colleagues at a Federal Open Market Committee meeting was in September 2005, when then governor Mark Olson favored easier policy than his colleagues.</p><p>Triple dissents are also unusual: The last time that happened was at the FOMC's September 2019 meeting, according to data from the St. Louis Fed.</p><p>The main argument for starting off with a big rate increase now owes to a sense that the Fed is well behind the curve in its mission to keep inflation under control, and because it will need to raise rates for some time to restore price stability, so an aggressive start will help.</p><p>Importantly, Mr. Powell hasn't closed the door to bigger action down the road. But he acknowledges there is great uncertainty around the outlook right now, and that with the Fed also set to shrink its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet fairly soon, a small first step reduces the risk of destabilizing markets.</p><p>The case for aggressive action has been complicated by Russia's war on Ukraine, which has roiled energy markets and is almost certain to drive inflation even higher, even as growth is likely to take a hit.</p><p>In a note to clients on Friday, economists at Goldman Sachs lowered their U.S. growth forecasts, citing the surge in oil prices and war-related factors. They wrote that \"we now see the risk that the U.S. enters a recession during the next year as broadly in line with the 20-35% odds currently implied\" by yield relationships in the bond market.</p><p>Put another way, the war and the risks it creates could prompt those who have been leaning toward a half-percentage point rate increase to reconsider.</p><p>Write to Michael S.
