  "title": "Expectations on ECB liftoff brought forward by Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale",
  "text": "<p>They say the ECB's asset purchase program will end in July, and expect quarter-point hikes in both September and December, which would take the ECB's main interest rate back to zero. They also expect three hikes in 2023, and then another two hikes in 2024 to take rates to 1.25%. “But we see risks towards a faster pace and a higher terminal rate, particularly if significant second-round effects emerge in inflation expectations and wage setting,” said the Goldman team.</p><p>Anatoli Annenkov of Societe Generale also has added one rate hike to his forecast, seeing quarter-point increases in September and December. “Although the amount of new data has been limited since the March meeting, the initial impression is that the euro area economy is showing promising resilience to the war in Ukraine and has certainly not fallen off a cliff (as in March 2020). This should steer ECB policymakers back to the troubling inflation data and the risk of unanchored inflation expectations,” he said.</p><p>Expectations are for the ECB to stand pat at the meeting. It's not clear whether European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde will participate in the press conference, as she said she's tested positive for COVID-19.</p><p>The yield on the 2-year German bund BX:TMBMKDE-02Y was marginally in positive territory on Friday. The euro EURUSDwas trading below $1.09.</p>",
