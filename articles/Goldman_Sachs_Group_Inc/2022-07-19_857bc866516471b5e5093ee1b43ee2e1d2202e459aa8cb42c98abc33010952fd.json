When not driving a taxi to pay his bills, Savitt's bands made appearances at such storied venues as <strong>CBGB</strong> and <strong>Irving Plaza</strong>.</p> <p>Eventually those dreams gave way to reality and grad school and then law school, both at <strong>Columbia University</strong>. After a clerkship for Supreme Court Justice <strong>Ruth Bader Ginsburg</strong>, Savitt landed at Wachtell, the M&amp;A and litigation powerhouse in New York where over the next two decades he would become one of the pre-eminent specialists in Delaware corporate law. </p> <p>Unlike many swaggering litigators, Savitt became best known for a gentle style that complemented his towering intellect.</p> <p>“Bill is not a flamboyant guy. He walks softly and carries a big stick. He does not need to yell. He does not need to be overly dramatic. When he addresses the court you see his relaxed nature. It's disarming,” said <strong>William Lafferty</strong>, a longtime Delaware lawyer. &#xa0;</p> <p>Musk is no stranger to legal fights or even the Delaware courts. The Tesla chief was absolved of wrongdoing in the small state from the carmaker's 2016 purchase of <strong>SolarCity</strong> (ironically, Savitt initially represented Musk in that case before another firm took over).</p> <p>The Elon/Twitter showdown has left observers looking for precedent cases as a guide for how this dispute might play out. Sujeet Indap looked at the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c763168-a5a2-4751-9e56-75b09dd9e9e8\">2008 fight</a> between <strong>Huntsman</strong> and <strong>Apollo</strong> — which also featured Wachtell. Huntsman, after a heated campaign waged against Apollo's <strong>Leon Black</strong> and <strong>Josh Harris</strong>, decided not to force the private equity firm to close its $11bn deal for the chemical company in the midst of the global financial crisis. </p> <p>Years later in his memoirs, <strong>Jon Huntsman</strong> wrote that despite his fury at the time, settling with Apollo for cash and ultimately forgiving its founders was the right thing to do. But in Twitter vs. Musk, now is the moment for litigation not goodwill. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <h1>An ‘unsettling' private equity buyout</h1> <p>“Let me say first of all that I appreciate that this sort of change is unsettling.”&#xa0;</p> <p>It's the kind of all-staff email that nobody wants to receive. </p> <p>But those are the words <strong>Andrew Rashbass</strong>, chief executive of <strong>Euromoney Institutional Investor</strong>, sent to employees on Monday. </p> <p>The unsettling change in question? A £1.7bn buyout by two private equity firms, which will split the financial publisher in two and see it removed from the <strong>London Stock Exchange</strong>, where it trades on the FTSE 250 index. The company has been public since 1986. &#xa0;</p> <p>Euromoney's board <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/af87ae1e-8aee-4ca3-abef-bd9113016fb5\">has accepted</a> the offer from <strong>Astorg</strong> and <strong>Epiris</strong> and will recommend it to shareholders. Seventy-five per cent would need to approve, for the deal to go through.</p> <p>If it does, Astorg would own Euromoney's <strong>Fastmarkets</strong> business, which publishes price reporting on raw materials such as wood and metals. Epiris would own the other units, including the division that publishes <strong>Institutional Investor</strong> magazine. </p> <p>Rashbass's email, seen by DD's Kaye Wiggins and Rob Smith, laid bare the tough consequences. “Unfortunately some central roles will no longer be required,” it said. </p> <p>It's a rare UK take-private at a time when inflation, interest rate rises and the war in Ukraine have hit confidence and left a gulf between the prices that sellers expect for deals and those that buyers are willing to pay.</p> <p>But that backdrop is partly what led Euromoney to accept the buyout bid, according to Rashbass's email. </p> <p>“In the end” the board “had to ask itself whether, taking into account the economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the world, [it] could be confident of delivering enough value quickly to shareholders compared with the certainty of a sale at a good price now”, he said. </p> <p>DD wonders whether this kind of calculation is a sign that staff at far more UK-listed companies could be facing the same kind of “unsettling” M&amp;A-related changes quite soon. </p> <h1>A British billionaire's crypto bets laid bare</h1> <p>British hedge fund titan <strong>Alan Howard</strong> has spent the past few years branching out into crypto land. </p> <p>The <strong>Brevan Howard</strong> founder's name has been attached to reports of fundraising for ventures from established crypto companies like <strong>FTX</strong> to obscure corners such as cryptocurrency-based trivia games and horseracing non-fungible tokens. </p> <p>Now, the FT's Joshua Oliver and Laurence Fletcher have mapped these seemingly random investments to create a more comprehensive picture of the billionaire's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e89061dd-634e-4024-b74a-5a102d4eb552\">crypto empire</a>. </p> <p>Their list of 43 investments shows a diversified portfolio touching most of the key components of digital asset markets. </p> <p>“It looks incredibly random until you put it on a map and then it looks incredibly strategic,” said a crypto company executive who has worked with Howard. “He wants to be involved in all facets of the industry.”&#xa0;</p> <p>Howard has made his investments over the past five years, sometimes alongside <strong>Tiger Global</strong>, <strong>SoftBank</strong> and <strong>Peter Thiel</strong>.</p> <p>Howard, who got married this year at a star-studded event at a villa near Italy's Lake Como, has even dabbled in crypto art. </p> <p>Howard declined to be interviewed by the FT, so we can't be sure how hard this year's crypto meltdown has hit his investments. But the pace of his investments has continued despite the latest brutal sell-off. </p> <p>And an investor who has worked with him reckons he remains bullish. “I wouldn't be surprised to see him come out of the other side of this bear market as one of the biggest players,” the person said. “He's positioning himself to take advantage of valuations.”&#xa0;</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Mark Wills</strong>, a portfolio manager at <strong>Elliott Management</strong>, has left the hedge fund in recent weeks, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Wills had worked at Elliott in its London office since 2011, per his LinkedIn. Wills declined to comment. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>António Horta-Osório</strong>, who was ousted as chair of <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bcc188f0-1a1e-4dd3-9ce2-27e42356b1eb\">has joined</a><strong> Italy's Mediobanca</strong> as a senior adviser. </p></li>  <li><p>Law firm <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> has hired <strong>Austin Witt </strong>as a partner in its debt finance group in New York. He joins from <strong>Paul Weiss</strong>. </p></li>  <li><p><strong>Glencore</strong> has named <strong>Liz Hewitt</strong> to its board. She is also a director at <strong>National Grid</strong>. </p></li>  <li><p>Public relations firm <strong>Teneo</strong> has appointed former US speaker of the house<strong> Paul Ryan</strong> as its vice-chair.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Mark Hartigan</strong>, the chief executive of UK life insurer <strong>LV</strong> who led management's failed attempt to demutualise and sell to US private equity company <strong>Bain Capital</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2495e183-7e2a-4d3c-a9e6-29491df41e16\">has quit</a> the company. &#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <h1>Smart Reads</h1> <p><strong>Sand and mirrors </strong>Prince Mohammed bin Salman's plan to build an urban megacity in the middle of the desert is not going well, just as could have been predicted.
