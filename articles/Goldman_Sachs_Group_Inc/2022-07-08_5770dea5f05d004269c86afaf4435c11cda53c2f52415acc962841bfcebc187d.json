  "text": "<p>The French government is working with Goldman Sachs and Société Générale as it explores how to take full control of utility EDF, with a tender offer to minority shareholders emerging as the preferred option, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>The government this week announced it would take back the 16 per cent of EDF it does not already own, saying the move would bolster the power group's finances as it gears up for more investments in costly nuclear reactors, and allow France to gain even greater control over its electricity production as Europe is rocked by an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/88f84738-6118-46ea-bb9b-261f65752142\">energy crisis</a>. </p> <p>The government has yet to detail how it will assume full ownership of the indebted company. A tender offer to EDF's shareholders, rather than trying to steer a nationalisation bill through parliament, is shaping up as the swiftest and most viable plan, according to three people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>“There's a need to go quickly here, and a market offer is more efficient than dealing with a political mess in parliament,” one of the people said. </p> <p>The parliamentary option would entail passing a law in effect authorising a form of expropriation so that the state could take full control, another person said, even if it still involved financial compensation for shareholders. </p> <p>Lazard and BNP Paribas are advising <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/5efa88f4-3de4-4e86-b61b-1c269bf3aac5\">EDF</a>, two people added.</p> <p>No final decision on how to proceed has yet been taken and the timing of any offer is still uncertain, although it would most likely be after the August lull. French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday the renationalisation could take several months. </p> <p>The banks and France's finance and energy ministries all declined to comment. </p> <p>An offer to minority shareholders, which includes many of EDF's own employees and other retail investors, would likely require support from all of the big French banks during the operation, another person familiar with the matter said. </p> <p>To squeeze out minority investors, any offer would have to reach the 90 per cent acceptance threshold. The state controls 84 per cent of EDF today, while the minority shareholdings are currently worth roughly €5bn. </p> <p>A swift resolution would remove EDF from the scrutiny of the stock market as it struggles with financial woes, even if a full nationalisation may do little to fix longer term problems the group is facing. Those include improving its industrial knowhow to avoid the huge cost overruns and missed deadlines that have plagued recent reactor projects. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0df04c06-83c0-4080-a68b-c00fd4bc4a11\">Corrosion problems</a> at some existing reactors have sliced EDF's electricity output, and the group has warned its core profit will be hit by €18.5bn as a result this year. It has also had to foot the bill for some electricity price caps dictated by the government. </p> <p>“In the short term, you have a situation in which the financial results are going to be catastrophic,” said Nicolas Goldberg, a senior energy analyst at Columbus Consulting. “There was going to be a need for another recapitalisation and the status quo was no longer possible.”</p> <p>One of the other options to nationalise EDF would be more vulnerable to the vagaries of politics. A bill to enforce the buyout would have to be passed through France's parliament, testing President Emmanuel Macron's ability to get lawmakers onside just weeks he lost his majority. </p> <p>Many opposition figures from the left and right have previously supported the idea of a return to state ownership for EDF, hailing it as the ultimate public service institution. </p> <p>But the process of pushing a bill through parliament could be much lengthier, running the risk of getting bogged down in “interminable debates”, one person familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Source: Sarah White and Leila Abboud in Aix-en-Provence 2022 'Banks line up for French state buyout of EDF ' FT.com 8 July.
