But par for the course for the South African entrepreneur.</p> <p>He conjured the leveraged buyout of <strong>Tesla </strong>on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0e7ba33-8827-49d9-85b4-8f371a9852be\">Twitter in 2018</a>, claiming he had the funds lined up to take the company private.</p> <p>The episode left in its wake an ongoing shareholder lawsuit, a $40mn settlement with the SEC and even a mandate for Musk to have his own in-house Twitter legal nanny to ensure he abides by securities laws when posting on the social media platform.</p> <p>Of course, Musk was little reformed. He repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ac226d6-0eba-4f97-91c1-fb70076c20b0\">sent tweets</a> that sent Tesla's stock moving. But the SEC did not act on Musk. Now it is staring down a regulatory can of worms.</p> <p>When Musk on Friday <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a0aa177e-607c-4f3c-b2af-ac74535e2d26\">tweeted</a> he had put his takeover of Twitter “temporarily on hold” over concerns about the number of spam and fake accounts on the social media platform, markets were quick to react. But corporate takeovers either proceed or are withdrawn. They aren't just punted on. </p> <p>Musk's tweets were widely viewed on Wall Street as an attempt by the billionaire to gain a foothold over Twitter ahead of negotiating a lower price.</p> <p>These may be the new “Muskian” rules of the road for M&amp;A.</p> <p>In the absence of a false statement by Musk or clear evidence he was deliberately seeking to push the stock price down, it's nearly impossible for the SEC to build a market manipulation case against the billionaire, legal experts told the FT.</p> <p>There is also a vein of thinking that the SEC could have nipped an increasingly volatile situation in the bud many years ago, or even when Musk first arrived on the scene at Twitter.</p> <p>Musk toed the line of his 2018 settlement without the regulator bringing an action against him. The SEC could have also stopped Musk in his tracks when pursuing Twitter. </p> <p>After all, Musk filed a passive stake in Twitter on April 4, and within a month had agreed to take over the company. In doing so, he flouted the 10-day grace period for investors who exceed the 5 per cent threshold that triggers disclosure requirements — revealing his 9 per cent stake about three weeks after the March 14 due date.</p> <p>The SEC's lack of action has given the world's richest man free rein to pursue his Twitter takeover ever more erratically on his social media platform of choice.</p> <p>“Has he become so important to such an important company that the SEC is afraid to do something?” one ex-SEC official asked. “It's a fair question”.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Vodafone dials-up dealmaking</h2> <p>For months now, <strong>Vodafone</strong> has had an albatross around its neck: <strong>Cevian Capital</strong>, Europe's biggest activist investor.</p> <p>The Swedish investor has been pushing for the UK telecoms operator to spin off its underperforming units and be more aggressive in driving consolidation in markets such as Spain, Italy and the UK where excessive competition has squeezed prices.</p> <p>Things are finally looking up. Vodafone has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c4f9aac3-94f0-4d4b-ae9b-5b9e97fbc2d1\">initiated talks</a> with Hong Kong infrastructure conglomerate <strong>CK Hutchison</strong> to combine its UK operations with <strong>Three UK</strong>, the FT revealed last week.</p> <p>And over the weekend, <strong>Emirates Telecommunications Group</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf101909-fd77-4bbd-8c1d-280244d748d6\">announced</a> that it had acquired a 9.8 per cent stake in Vodafone for about $4.4bn.</p> <p>Vodafone's shareholders did not seem too enthused, however. </p> <p>The UK group's share price rose less than 2 per cent following the news, a muted reaction compared to the 7 per cent jump in the shares of domestic rival <strong>BT</strong> back in June of last year, when Franco-Israeli tycoon <strong>Patrick Drah</strong>i took a stake.</p> <p>Analysts and investors who spoke with the FT had mixed feelings on whether the latest deal is conducive to its strategy, or if it simply piles on more demands on embattled CEO <strong>Nick Read</strong>. </p> <p>“Ultimately it does weaken the hand of an activist a bit, as we now have a strategic investor who has paid a premium to the current share price,” said <strong>Jakob Bluestone</strong>, an analyst at <strong>Credit Suisse</strong>. “It allows Vodafone to take its time and reduces pressure to deliver immediate results.”</p> <p>Others fear the deal only ratchets up the pressure on Read. The UAE group built its position without letting management know it was planning to do so.</p> <p>It's clearly expecting a material rise in the share price. As our friends at Lex <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22379e34-6eca-40f6-a714-2ce69311055b\">pointed out</a>: “Even a friend wants bang for their buck when they are spending $4.4bn.”</p> <h2>Can one billionaire clean up crypto?</h2> <p><strong>Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>, whose crypto exchange<strong> FTX </strong>has catapulted him to fame and a $24bn paper fortune, says he plans to give away at least 99 per cent of what he earns as quickly as possible.</p> <p>“I have about $100,000 in my bank account. And I think we have given away about $100mn so far this year,” he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83bc681a-a0f9-43bb-b627-c6dacae4a0a3\">told the FT's Joshua Oliver</a> over falafel and Impossible fake-meat tacos.</p> <p>Despite the generous pledge, however, the billionaire — known widely as SBF — has plenty of cash sloshing around to do deals. Last week, the crypto mogul revealed that he'd <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bc8b24b6-2f25-42b6-bf82-bcaf7d698a0d\">bought a 7.6 per cent stake</a> in online stock brokerage<strong> Robinhood </strong>for $648mn.</p> <p>The announcement sent Robinhood's stock soaring 25 per cent in after-hours trading but has since retreated. The trading platform has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d38bd1d3-1a2f-4367-8f3e-731db590e541\">lost steam</a> over the past year following its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81e9871b-5d12-480b-87a8-454b69e11958\">disappointing public debut</a>.</p> <p>But it makes sense why the company's mission to “democratise finance” would appeal to SBF, who holds a similar vision for crypto despite the risks associated with trading risky derivatives products that are banned in several countries.</p> <p>“You don't want it to be a way to transfer wealth from the poor to the rich,” he said. “But I think there have been way more examples where there have been people who had very little, who ended up making a lot from crypto and for whom it changed their life.”</p> <p>One person interested in hearing SBF's views is <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> chief <strong>David Solomon</strong>.</p> <p>The Wall Street boss recently met Bankman-Fried in the Caribbean to discuss ways to forge closer ties between the New York investment bank and FTX, as the FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53dde228-02bb-4193-b47e-0d171ae96073\">revealed</a> in April.</p> <p>The trip came less than a year after the crypto billionaire <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8ffb228-1dbe-4e8a-b30b-be7203d71e7d\">told our colleague Eva Szalay</a> that buying a financial institution such as Goldman would be “not out of the question at all” should it overtake its rival trading platforms.</p> <p>DD wonders if holding talks with one of Wall Street's most prestigious banks fits Bankman-Fried's calls to disrupt an “entrenched elite” of banks and social media companies. </p> <p><strong>Job moves</strong></p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>General Atlantic </strong>has appointed former <strong>Inditex Group</strong> chief and<strong> Nestlé </strong>board member <strong>Pablo Isla</strong> as a global senior adviser.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Latham &amp; Watkins</strong> has hired <strong>David Sherman </strong>as a partner in its investment funds and private equity practices in New York.
