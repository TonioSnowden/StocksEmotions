  "text": "<p><strong>One thing to start:</strong> EG Group, the petrol station company whose owners also control UK supermarket Asda, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d9985ad-b3d8-4cd9-b5bf-efffe7019e67\">has told its investors</a> for a third year running that it needs more time to produce audited accounts, citing the increased size and complexity of the business.</p> <h2>Oligarchs on the run</h2> <p>For more than two decades, it has paid to be in <strong>Vladimir Putin</strong>'s inner circle of crony capitalists.</p> <p>But in the past few weeks, it's become increasingly difficult to be a Russian oligarch. And not just because they're <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/428dfd0b-69e3-4a5b-ae25-08fbbb3c5950\">running out of places to park their yachts</a>.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Russian-Israeli billionaire <strong>Roman Abramovich</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cfcfb51f-be3b-4eae-a922-948e89e12610\">put <strong>Chelsea FC</strong> up for sale</a> after 19 years of ownership, waiving the £1.5bn it owes him and pledging to donate proceeds of the sale to victims of the war in Ukraine. </p> <p>The billionaire industrialist rose to riches during the Russian government's chaotic loans-for-shares privatisation auctions in the 1990s, which gained the nickname prikhvatizatsiya, or “grabbing”, for the less than equitable role they played in stamping out communism.</p> <p>But despite <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7cbbd456-a253-4de2-bb18-cd48aba5e4ff\">stepping back</a> from running Chelsea and playing an “advocacy role” in talks between Kyiv and Moscow this week, <strong>Abramovich</strong>'s efforts to distance himself from the Kremlin and get ahead of potential sanctions haven't deterred certain UK politicians.</p> <p>The move to sell the <strong>Premier League</strong> team came after Labour party leader <strong>Sir Keir Starmer</strong> called on the UK government to sanction Abramovich, urging lawmakers to “stand up to Putin and those who prop up his regime”.</p> <p>Abramovich isn't the only oligarch facing blowback. On Wednesday, the former oil barons<strong> Mikhail Fridman</strong> and<strong> Petr Aven </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c1837a20-6147-45c5-876c-add96ee8432c\">stepped down</a> from <strong>LetterOne</strong>, the London-based investment group, after the pair were hit by EU sanctions <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/85d76bd6-f585-4ac9-abae-b9abbf21e4bf\">earlier this week</a> for their alleged support of Putin.</p> <p>They both deny the association and have said that they would take legal action to overturn the measures.</p> <p>LetterOne was formed in 2013 after the duo sold their $14bn stake in Russian oil company <strong>TNK-BP</strong> to its domestic rival <strong>Rosneft</strong>.</p> <p>Together Fridman and Aven own slightly less than 50 per cent of the investment manager, stakes which have now been frozen. They have also been cut off from the group's offices and access to documents. LetterOne itself hasn't been sanctioned but its move to bar the two Russian oligarchs underscores the drastic measures being taken by companies to limit reputational risks.</p> <p>LetterOne's empire spans Spanish supermarket chain <strong>Dia</strong>, German energy group <strong>Wintershall Dea</strong> and UK health food retailer <strong>Holland &amp; Barrett</strong>. </p> <p>The billionaires say they are “shocked” as they contemplate a return to Russia. Abramovich could be considering making an exit of his own. He's looking to sell his plush £100mn-plus Grade II listed home in London's exclusive Kensington Palace Gardens, located near embassies and the homes of fellow billionaires.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the UK government is looking at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/71a856af-061b-49cc-8c30-7819d2296f96\">seizing properties</a> owned by oligarchs linked to Putin. </p> <p>Aside from the challenge of finding estate agents and lawyers to sell the property amid sanctions, DD wonders whether “a house fit for an oligarch” is really a good selling point these days.</p> <h2>‘Blood money': Russia becomes risky business for foreign advisers</h2> <p>For advisers looking to open shop in Russia in the early 1990s, the fall of the Soviet Union spelt a big opportunity. </p> <p>Yet walking the geopolitical tightrope between Russia and the west hasn't always been easy.</p> <p>Last year <strong>McKinsey</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6110fe11-98e4-42ec-9522-f86d0a458ea2\">faced a backlash</a> from employees when its Moscow managing partner <strong>Vitaly Klintsov</strong> urged staff not to protest the jailing of <strong>Alexei Navalny</strong>, one of Putin's most prominent critics. The firm later <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/374a13d9-9e71-4d8f-8286-ef5c1de27683\">issued a mea culpa</a> in the FT.&#xa0;</p> <p>As Moscow escalates its war on Ukraine, that tightrope has all but snapped in half, and the hordes of professional services firms that once flocked to make money in Russia are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04643842-4c2b-489f-8c24-f349043308ed\">now under pressure</a> to abandon Putin's increasingly hostile regime.</p> <p>Last weekend, McKinsey's global managing partner<strong> Bob Sternfels </strong>called Moscow's action in Ukraine “indefensible” and announced that the consultancy “will no longer serve any government entity in Russia”, where the company has more than 400 staff and partners. </p> <p><strong>Boston Consulting Group </strong>and<strong> Bain &amp; Company</strong> also said they would refuse to work for Russian government entities, but similar to McKinsey, have yet to shutter their operations in the country or stop working for state-owned companies. </p> <p>Those actions haven't been enough for some. “It's blood money . . . staining you with each day that you keep it open,” former McKinsey senior partner<strong> Andrei Caramitru</strong> wrote in a <strong>LinkedIn </strong>post to Sternfels.</p> <p>Public relations groups including<strong> FTI Consulting </strong>and <strong>Brunswick</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3b2f81e-7ddb-4078-a96d-1c78ce7fcccd\">made moves</a> to protect their own reputations, cutting ties with Russian clients this week. Auditor <strong>Grant Thornton</strong> also took action,<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/04643842-4c2b-489f-8c24-f349043308ed\"> the FT revealed</a>, becoming the first large professional services firm to sever links with <strong>FBK</strong>, its Russian member firm which audits state oil company <strong>Gazprom</strong>.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8851408.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>The international accounting firm's Big Four rivals have yet to confirm they have dropped any clients. <strong>PwC </strong>audits Gazprom's German subsidiary and <strong>Sberbank</strong>, Russia's largest bank, which has been sanctioned by the US. <strong>EY </strong>signs off the accounts of the state-backed oil group Rosneft. </p> <p>Some consulting and accounting bosses are hesitant to speak out against Moscow due to fears that they could put their staff at risk of retaliation by the Russian government or protesters, people involved in internal discussions at the firms told the FT.</p> <p>But some have also risked repeating McKinsey's mis-step in trying to suppress the personal views of staff. </p> <p>On Saturday, EY's global boss <strong>Carmine Di Sibio</strong> reminded staff to follow the firm's media policies and to “avoid comments which, if associated with EY, may cause concern to EY, our clients and other stakeholders”, in a memo seen by the FT.&#xa0;</p> <p>Only on Monday evening did EY publicly condemn the war in Ukraine. One employee told the FT's Michael O'Dwyer that he was “furious” about the firm's delay in making a statement, adding that there was “so much internal fear of upsetting some . . . clients”.</p> <h2>Netflix: game on</h2> <p>DD readers are well aware of how hot gaming M&amp;A has been this year. Now, <strong>Netflix </strong>has logged on. </p> <p>The streaming group has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2339f6ae-fb26-4a32-981b-492e2e984f3b\">snapped up <strong>Next Games</strong></a>, the Finnish developer behind mobile games based on hit shows <em>Stranger Things</em> and <em>The Walking Dead</em>. </p> <p>The €65mn cash deal, Netflix's biggest gaming purchase yet, comes as consolidation in the gaming industry has ratcheted up, with big tech group's turning their attention towards the industry.</p> <p>New York-based <strong>Take-Two Interactive</strong> kicked off the shopping spree in January when it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2b100b6-2916-4d0d-b23e-f0dd240757aa\">bought</a> <em>Words with Friends</em> maker <strong>Zynga </strong>for $12.7bn and <strong>Microsoft </strong>upped the ante with its planned <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b96246ec-e70e-48b6-9a70-fb0800f79bd8\">$75bn acquisition</a> of <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong>. Two weeks later, <strong>Sony</strong> bought <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f34d42bb-776a-4163-b881-b0ede4f38301\"><strong>Bungie</strong></a>, the developer behind the <em>Halo </em>franchise. </p> <p>Netflix is priming to compete by plotting an expansion into gaming. It plans to bundle gaming into its entertainment service and bought its first developer <strong>Night School Studio</strong> in September.</p> <p>As said by The Governor, <em>The Walking Dead</em>'s reviled antagonist: “Sooner or later, you've got to make a move.”</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Boris Lvin</strong>, a senior adviser to Russia's representative at the<strong> World Bank</strong>, has become the first Russian official <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4bdc488a-fc2b-410e-a62a-f2d785829f32?shareType=nongift\">to resign</a> from a prominent position at an international body in protest at the country's invasion of Ukraine.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Standard Chartered</strong> has <a href=\"https://investegate.co.uk/standard-chrtrd-plc--stan-/rns/directorate-changes/202203021215023884D/\">appointed</a><strong> Citibank </strong>veteran<strong> Shirish Moreshwar Apte</strong> and <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong>'s former head of European financial institution M&amp;A <strong>Robin Ann Lawther </strong>as independent non-executive directors to its board.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> partner <strong>Heather von Zuben</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-02/goldman-s-heather-von-zuben-to-exit-a-year-after-making-partner?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=220302&amp;utm_campaign=author_17510379\">is leaving</a> the investment bank, per Bloomberg.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Law firm <strong>White &amp; Case</strong> has hired<strong> Vincenzo Lucibello</strong> as co-head of its US private credit and direct lending group.
