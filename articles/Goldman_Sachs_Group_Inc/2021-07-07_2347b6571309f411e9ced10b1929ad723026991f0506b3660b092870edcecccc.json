  "title": "New York City's Exclusive Clubs  Have Gone to the Dogs  ---  Humans shell out fees for private pooch  paradise, with swimming pools and rules  ----  By Anne Kadet",
  "text": "<p>   What may be New York City's strangest private club lies on an odd-angled lot wedged between Bus Ramp 99 from the Port Authority Bus Terminal and a vehicular entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel in Manhattan. Here, members relax under a pergola with hanging baskets of petunias, sipping filtered water and gnawing tennis balls. Sometimes they wrestle in the gravel. </p><p>   \"It's a place to get away, just a fun little place,\" says longtime member and volunteer Tim Ousey, visiting on a recent morning with his 12-year-old beagles, Betty and Judy. </p><p>   Welcome to Astro's Dog Run, founded in 1994, as legend has it, by an eponymous German shepherd from Pasadena, Calif. The members-only mini park reopened last month following a repair job on the bus-ramp railing, and canines in the surrounding Hell's Kitchen neighborhood couldn't be happier. </p><p>   While the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation maintains 84 public dog runs -- featuring amenities ranging from spray hydrants to climbing mounds -- some of the city's fussier furred residents prefer a members-only situation, and Astro's is one of a handful in the metropolis. </p><p>   Like most membership runs, Astro's admits only dogs who have been vaccinated, licensed and whose owners agree to strict rules: If two dogs fight, both leave. Dues, which cover park maintenance, insurance and supplies, are $40 a year. Members get a key for 24/7 access. It's like a Gramercy Park for dogs, with a lot more buses whizzing by. </p><p>   \"I love that it's private because it's not overcrowded. You're familiar with the dogs and the people, so it feels like more of a community,\" says Carl Zerenga, a banker who arrived on a recent morning with his Italian Waterdog, Otto. \"It feels safer because you know all the dogs have been vaccinated and there's been a vetting process.\" </p><p>   Mr. Ousey, a landscaper who visits the 80-foot-long run daily, says members have used the space, provided by the Port Authority, for midnight snowball fights, holiday parties, a memorial service for a member who died, and the occasional humans-only barbecue with cocktails. \"When we have food, the dogs want to jump on the table,\" he says. </p><p>   Astro's has a close cousin in Queens. The Jackson Heights Canine Recreational Wonderland run is located on state-owned land under a freight train trestle, alongside the roaring Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. \"All the prime real estate goes to dog runs,\" quips member and volunteer Jerry Goldman, surveying the shadowy space surrounded by chain link fencing. </p><p>   \"You get used to the noise,\" he adds. \"It's like a little refuge, and when it's full of dogs, everybody's happy.\" </p><p>   Here, membership is free, but many contribute the suggested $25 annual donation for supplies and maintenance. There are play tunnels and solar-powered lighting, along with separate runs for big and small dogs. \"But that fell by the wayside because so many of the little dogs want to play with the big dogs,\" Mr. Goldman says. </p><p>   Astro's and the Queens run are both maintained by volunteer-run nonprofits. At the other end of the spectrum is the School Yard at School For the Dogs in Manhattan's East Village. The training school's dog-run service, operating in an indoor run with a backyard, is billed as the city's only trainer-supervised run. Members paying the $2,200 annual dues for an off-leash membership may visit five times a month. Attendance is limited to six dogs for each session. </p><p>   It's an exclusive club. Prospective members must complete a lengthy application that includes questions about their dog's behavior and relationship history, answer a 17-question quiz on proper dog-run comportment and submit a video clip of their pet engaging with other dogs off-leash. This is followed by a $40 in-person evaluation visit. The pass rate is about 70%. </p><p>   Off-leash manager and associate trainer Adam Davis, who supervises the play sessions, sounds like the ultimate helicopter pet parent. \"We like to set them up for success first by making sure they are nice and calm,\" he says. He supervises the interaction, introducing toys and helping dogs practice their \"break cues\" when the play gets too intense. </p><p>   He also mingles with owners, providing tips and translating \"meta signals\" displayed by the dogs. </p><p>   Mr. Davis says he has a hard time at public runs with bullying dogs and inattentive owners. \"It's like when a person who has OCD goes to a messy home -- I just can't!\" </p><p>   A big indoor space is the draw for Brooklyn's Acme Dog Run. The 4,000-square-foot brick and concrete playground opened two years ago in a former upholstery shop. </p><p>   The business is currently open only for daycare because of the pandemic, but will soon resume its owner-and-pup playtime service, which costs $15 for two hours, says owner Matt Majesky. It includes coffee for owners to sip, while they watch their dogs romp on the mezzanine stairs and play under the disco ball accompanied by tunes from a jukebox stocked with canine-themed tracks such as Led Zeppelin's \"Black Dog\" and \"Hot Dog\" by the Archies. </p><p>   The service is most popular when it's raining or snowing, attracting dogs from all over Brooklyn and Queens, Mr. Majesky says. </p><p>   And in hot weather, downtown Manhattan dogs head to the members-only West Village Dog Run, which features bone- and paw-shaped swimming pools. \"The big ones fit two to three labs,\" says Tracey Sides, a volunteer and founding member of the West Village Dog Owners Group who helped launch the organization's first run in 1995. </p><p>   Located on a 3,000-square-foot former parking lot owned by the state on Little West 12th Street, the club lost half its membership during the pandemic when many dogs fled town, but is fast rebuilding, Ms. Sides says. </p><p>   The 250-odd families paying the club's $245 annual dues, which covers rent, insurance and utilities, enjoy an introductory orientation, poolside benches and communal toys, along with unlimited hand wipes and waste bags. </p><p>   Back at Astro's Dog Run, Mr. Ousey says while the traffic noise can get overwhelming at rush hour, the space remains his favorite respite. \"I have a little slice of heaven in Midtown Manhattan. How many people can say that?\" </p><p></p>",
