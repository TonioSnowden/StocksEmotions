  "text": "<p>Outsourcer Serco raised its 2021 profit target after its NHS Test and Trace contracts proved more lucrative than previously expected. </p> <p>Underlying trading profit this year will be around £200m, up £15m on previous guidance as all five of its divisions traded in-line or ahead of their budgets in the first five months of the year, Serco said. </p> <p>“In the UK in particular, volumes on both our Testing and Tracing contracts have continued to be strong and we now think it likely that demand for these services will continue for longer in the second half than we previously anticipated,” the company said in a trading update. The company is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0dca9736-599b-43b8-a3b0-f341cb81e777\">one of five</a> running UK Covid-19 testing sites and also provides call handlers on the NHS's contact tracing programme.</p> <p>Serco also revealed that its VIVO Defence Services joint venture had been awarded contracts under the UK's Future Defence Infrastructure Services programme worth £900m over the initial seven-year period. </p> <p>Consensus forecasts for 2021 and 2022 are likely to rise by 8-10 per cent in response, said Jefferies analyst Kean Marden. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Ted Baker</strong> said first-quarter trading remained “materially impacted” by Covid restrictions after posting an underlying pre-tax loss of £59.2m for the year ended January. The fashion retailer said first quarter group revenue fell 19.9 per cent as the loosening of UK restrictions failed to spark a full recovery. Sales in metro cities and travel retail locations, which accounted for about a third of pre-Covid global store revenues remain “materially below” 2020 trading levels, the company said.</p> <p>Chip designer <strong>Alphawave IP</strong>, whose shares have slumped 23 per cent since flotation last month, said in its maiden trading update that total bookings hit a record in the second quarter and had exceeded $190m in the year to date. </p> <p>Staffing group <strong>SThree </strong>said net fees were up 22 per cent year on year in the second quarter ended May and said it will pay an interim dividend. The company reiterated full-year guidance from a trading update earlier this month and flagged a strong balance sheet with net cash of about £48m at the end of the period. SThree also announced the appointment of Andrew Beach, former chief financial officer of events group Hyve, as its new chief financial officer.</p> <p><strong>Royal Dutch Shell</strong> is reviewing its holdings in the US Permian Basin oilfield for a potential sale, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-shell-usa-permian-idUSKCN2DP0K5\">Reuters reported</a>. The fields accounted for around 6 per cent of Shell's total oil and gas output last year and could be worth more than $10bn, it said citing people familiar with the matter.</p> <p><strong>John Menzies</strong>, the aviation logistics services group, revealed a joint venture to expand in the the Chinese cargo market. The group has agreed a £3.4m investment&#xa0;to buy a minority equity stake&#xa0;in Guangzhou JFreight. Menzies will manage and operate a new cargo terminal at Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in China on behalf of JFreight shareholders, the company said.</p> <p><strong>Saga</strong> said its cruise business is ready to restart sailings from June 27, subject to government restrictions. Its cash burn rate for the year to date was at the lower end of the guidance of £7m to £9m per month and liquidity remains strong with total available cash of £78m at the end of May, it said. Saga's insurance division reported motor and home policy sales 2 per cent behind the prior year, reflecting a competitive market, but said the picture had improved since the start of May.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>BNP Paribas</strong> is facing allegations that its traders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a471ac3-3adc-44bc-8657-4e84f2702f06\">mis-sold billions of euros</a> of lossmaking foreign exchange products to Europe's largest wine exporter. <strong>J. García Carrión</strong>, founded in Jumilla in south-east Spain in 1890, is in dispute with the French lender over currency transactions with a cumulative notional amount of tens of billions of euros. </p> <p><strong>Flagship Pioneering</strong>, the venture capital company behind vaccine maker Moderna, has raised <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a63d25dd-ac6a-4bc5-9d38-5b42967e93cd\">its largest fund</a> as it aims to build the next generation of biotech companies. The $3.4bn fund is one of the biggest amassed in the pharmaceutical industry and comes at a time when investment is&#xa0;flooding into the sector. The Massachusetts-based group plans to deploy the cash over the next three years.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> has stepped up <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12ea44c7-d940-4b75-bd94-4fd2116c1c76\">its trading in battery metal cobalt</a>, latching on to one of the hottest corners of the commodities market as carmakers transition to electric vehicles.&#xa0;The involvement of banks such as Goldman could help bring liquidity to the trading of cobalt, an opaque market where prices are determined privately between buyers and sellers.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Mohamed El-Erian </strong>The US Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting this week has turned from a snooze-fest into a test of the US central bank's narrative that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/46450be2-99dd-43ec-a9f3-9cf3c60d72e1\">the current spike in inflation is transitory</a>.</p> <p><strong>Pilita Clark</strong> A draining, always-on work culture was a problem before the pandemic and has worsened <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29fc2a4a-cb50-4118-9d2d-f4c557626bc7\">considerably since</a>. No wonder governments around the world are facing rising pressure to give workers something long considered a suspect novelty — the right to disconnect.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Serco raises 2021 profit forecast' FT.com 14 June.
