  "title": "Private Bets Ease Pain For Hedge Portfolios",
  "text": "<p>Dan Sundheim's $25 billion D1 Capital Partners, for example, is down 4% in its public bets for the year through September -- but up 71% before fees in its private investments, said people familiar with the firm. The S&amp;P 500 had a total return of 15.9% for the period.</p><p>D1 clients opt into share classes that offer varying levels of exposure to private investments. Clients in the share class that can invest up to 15% in private companies have seen gains of about 4.5%, after fees, for the period. The gains stand at 14% and 21% for clients in share classes that can invest up to 35% and 50% in private companies.</p><p>Meanwhile, Boston-based Whale Rock Capital Management was down 11.2% for its public investments in a hedge fund that can invest up to a quarter of its clients' money in private companies, said people familiar with the fund. The performance of the fund's private wagers shrank the fund's losses to 3.3% for the year through September.</p><p>Hedge funds without private companies in their portfolios have had a rougher time. Palo Alto, Calif.-based Light Street Capital Management, which manages late-stage growth and other funds along with a hedge fund that only invests in public companies, is down 18.6% for the year through September in its hedge fund, said people familiar with the firm. That has brought the fund's size down to about $1.7 billion.</p><p>Its growth funds have fared much better, the people said, with Light Street's first such fund, whose investments include the restaurant-software provider Toast Inc. and the software-development company GitLab Inc., expected to have an internal rate of return of more than 100%.</p><p>The rush into private investing by public-market investors has helped fuel surging valuations for private companies. And as hedge funds, along with mutual funds and sovereign-wealth funds, deploy billions of dollars, they often crowd out venture and growth funds.</p><p>Hedge funds made up 27% of the money raised in private rounds this year through June, despite participating in just 4% of the deals, according to a recent report by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.</p><p>\"These tech companies are growing exponentially, and managers want to capture that huge exponential growth for their clients,\" said Susan Webb, founder and investment chief at outsourced-investment firm Appomattox Advisory.</p><p>The higher-return potential is stark. Private-equity and venture strategies gained an average 14.2% a year in the decade ended in 2020, Goldman said, while hedge funds overall averaged half those annual returns over the period -- and were subject to the stresses of regular redemption cycles.</p><p>Stock-picking hedge funds had a banner year in 2020, buoyed by markets that set highs after bottoming in March.</p><p>Their fortunes in public markets have changed this year. The meme-stock rally in January, which sent the price of companies including GameStop Corp. to extraordinary heights, dealt losses to myriad hedge funds. Whale Rock gained 71% last year, while the D1 share class investing up to 15% of clients' money in private companies climbed 60%; in January they lost about 11% and 30%, respectively, in just their public investments.</p><p>While D1 has almost recouped those losses, Whale Rock and other growth-oriented stock pickers have struggled. Fund managers say sector rotations that have alternately favored growth or value have made it difficult to navigate markets.</p><p>Meanwhile, private markets have continued to be supportive. The U.S. IPO market is flourishing, and companies are continuing to raise more money in private markets than before.</p>",
