  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said earlier Thursday it was planning an exit from Russia while Citigroup Inc. has said it is evaluating its future.</p><p>JPMorgan's presence in Russia is relatively small and involves investment-banking operations and banking services for clients in Russia, mostly international companies. Those operations are harder to close and the exit won't be as swift as the corporations who are closing.</p><p>The bank's lending and investment exposure to London hasn't ranked among the biggest 20 countries it operates in since 2015, when it and rivals cut back business following Russia's annexation of Crimea. The lack of disclosure implies JPMorgan has less than $4.9 billion in exposure to Russia.</p><p>Goldman Sachs was the first big U.S. bank to make a move to leave Russia. The Wall Street bank said it is winding down its businesses and is focused on helping its clients manage their exposure or get out of Russia.</p><p>Last month, the bank said it had only about $1 billion in exposure to Russia as of the end of the year, with about $650 million in outstanding credits and $413 million in markets. That makes it a relatively tiny market for the bank, which has $1.46 trillion in assets.</p>",
