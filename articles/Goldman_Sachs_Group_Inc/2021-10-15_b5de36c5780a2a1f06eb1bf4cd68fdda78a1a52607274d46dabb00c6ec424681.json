  "text": "<p>* Goldman Sachs was up 2% premarket in the minutes after the release of its quarterly earnings report.</p><p>* J.B. Hunt Transport Services gained 4.4% premarket. The supply-chain management company reported a 59% rise in third-quarter profit as all of the company's segments pushed revenue above market expectations in the period.</p><p>* PNC Financial Services slipped 1% after it reported a profit decline as costs from a merger raised non-interest expenses.</p><p>* Southwest Gas edged up 0.7%, building on Thursday's late-session 7% jump. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn escalated his challenge to the Nevada utility by offering to buy shares and announcing plans to try to replace the company's board.</p><p>* Moderna gained 3.3% premarket after vaccine experts advising the FDA voted, 19-0, to recommend authorization of an extra dose of its Covid-19 shot.</p><p>* Alcoa climbed 6.6%. The aluminum maker reported a 31% rise in sales for its latest quarter, even as shipments fell, partly because of a lack of railcars.</p><p>* Bitcoin prices were up 3.4%, bringing it closer to $60,000, and crypto stocks were enjoying the ride. Coinbase Global added 1.8%, Marathon Digital gained 3.8% and BIT Mining rose 8.4%.</p><p>* Duck Creek Technologies sank 18% premarket. The enterprise software company reported a net loss for the final quarter of its fiscal year.</p><p>Chart of the Day</p><p>* Shares of Petershill Partners, an investment vehicle managed by Goldman Sachs' asset-management arm, are down 9% since its initial public offering late last month. That is worse than both the broader market and peers.</p><p>Write to James Willhite at james.willhite@wsj.com</p><p>Virgin Galactic, Bitcoin, Moderna, Goldman: What to Watch When the Stock Market Opens Today</p>",
