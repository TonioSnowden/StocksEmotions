  "text": "<p>Russian miner GV Gold is planning an initial public offering on the Moscow stock exchange, the latest in a rush of Russian listings seeking to tap resurgent investor interest in the country's assets.</p> <p>The midsized gold miner, which counts BlackRock as a major shareholder, is seeking a valuation of $1.5bn-$1.8bn, people familiar with the matter told the Financial Times. </p> <p>GV Gold's announcement on Monday follows the flotation of discount retailer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e4008abc-a82e-4448-b97b-427a20203de9\">Fix Price</a> this month — the largest Russian listing since western sanctions were imposed against the country in 2014 — and the IPO of online retailer Ozon in New York late last year. </p> <p>Those sanctions, imposed after Moscow's annexation of Crimea, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25fb826c-8e6d-11e8-b639-7680cedcc421\">damped investor appetite</a> for Russian assets. Fears over the impact of subsequent measures have helped to scupper dozens of proposed, planned and announced Russian IPOs since. </p> <p>Despite lingering worries over potential new sanctions against Russia from the Biden administration, Moscow's market has rebounded strongly from its pandemic lows, driven by a surge in global stimulus that has buoyed demand for emerging market assets and a recovery in oil prices.</p> <p>GV Gold, which shelved a London listing plan in 2007 and a second listing attempt <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdb93532-22d1-11e9-b329-c7e6ceb5ffdf)\">three years ago</a>, said all its major shareholders, including BlackRock funds, would sell shares in the float. The company will not sell shares in the float, it said.</p> <p>BlackRock owns 18 per cent of the eastern Siberia-focused miner, which is aiming to produce around 300,000 troy ounces this year and reported net profit of $137m last year. Just over 61 per cent of GV Gold is owned by a trio of co-founders.</p> <p>“Since the very first day we have seen the future of GV Gold as a publicly traded company,” said Vladislav Barshinov, chief executive. “An IPO on [the] Moscow exchange will enable us to take our growth story to a wide range of investors and further diversify our shareholder structure.”</p> <p>Goldman Sachs International, Sberbank CIB, UBS and VTB Capital are joint global co-ordinators and joint bookrunners for the offering, GV Gold said. Raiffeisen and Sova Capital are co-bookrunners.</p><p>Source: Henry Foy in Moscow 2021 'Russian miner GV Gold joins Moscow IPO rush' FT.com 15 March.
