  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs has won initial approval from Chinese regulatory authorities for a wealth management joint venture with ICBC, one of China's largest banks, as Wall Street expands its presence in the country.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management will hold a 51 per cent stake in the venture, while ICBC wealth management, a subsidiary of the bank, will own the rest. </p> <p>Foreign asset managers are rushing to capitalise on China's vast pool of savings as the government liberalises its tightly controlled financial system.</p> <p>BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, this month said it had received permission to start a wealth management <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3fd79007-e556-4f04-aa6e-43557652890f\">joint venture</a> with China Construction Bank and Singapore's state fund Temasek.</p> <p>Wealth management products in China are typically distributed through the domestic banking network, pushing foreign asset managers into partnerships with local banks. </p> <p>The industry is regulated by the China banking and insurance regulatory commission, CBIRC. Goldman said that the partnership had preliminary approval from the CBIRC.</p> <p>“China's wealth management industry has grown on the back of increased household wealth and continued financial market reform,” said Tuan Lam, head of the client business for Asia Pacific ex-Japan at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.</p> <p>“This joint venture with China's pre-eminent financial institution will accelerate our objective of establishing a leadership position in one of the world's largest, fastest-growing wealth management opportunities,” he added.</p> <p>Goldman's global investment research arm estimates that investable assets by Chinese households will exceed $70tn by 2030, more than half of which will be allocated to products such as securities, mutual funds and wealth management products.</p> <p>A report from Boston Consulting Group and China Everbright Bank showed that China's wider wealth market was worth Rmb121.6tn ($18.9tn) in 2020, up 10 per cent from a year earlier.</p> <p>Amundi, the French asset manager, became the first foreign company to launch a majority foreign-owned wealth management business last year when it partnered with Bank of China. JPMorgan Asset Management last year unveiled plans to buy out its mutual fund joint venture partner.</p> <p>Government reforms in China have encouraged greater foreign involvement across financial services, including allowing foreign companies to own mutual fund businesses fully for the first time. </p><p>Source: Thomas Hale 2021 'Goldman wins approval for wealth management deal in China' FT.com 25 May.
