  "text": "<p>The series, appropriately dubbed Musical Storefronts, kicked off in January and is scheduled to run through the end of March.</p><p>The center is careful not to announce the exact location of the performances, except to say they take place somewhere north of Columbus Circle on the West Side, to keep large crowds from gathering. Similarly, the center isn't providing information on exact performance dates and times.</p><p>But the Kaufman team does note it is booking a range of artists from all genres, including classical, jazz and Broadway, for the series. Already, violinist Sean Lee, a regular on the New York and national concert scene, and Chrystal E. Williams, a mezzo-soprano who has appeared with the Metropolitan Opera, have performed in separate events.</p><p>Ms. Williams said it is somewhat a disembodying experience to sing behind plate glass for New Yorkers as they go about their day. But she noted that the city is very much about window shopping, so the series made sense. \"It totally fits New York.\"</p><p>The Kaufman center doesn't take credit for the idea behind the series. Rather, it was Jay Dweck, a onetime Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley executive and an amateur violinist, who largely came up with the concept.</p><p>Mr. Dweck -- who serves on the advisory board of the New York-based Alphadyne Foundation, created by the hedge fund Alphadyne Asset Management -- said he was walking in Manhattan and taking note of some of the empty storefronts. He thought that filling them with musicians wouldn't only bring some much-needed life to the city, it would give performers a paid gig at the same time performance opportunities are limited.</p><p>So, Mr. Dweck set the idea in motion, with the foundation supporting the project financially and running it through the Kaufman center. He declined to say how much funding was provided to run the series and compensate the artists.</p><p>Of course, performing for an audience of pedestrians on the go is different than performing for those gathered in a concert hall. Mr. Lee, the violinist, said he has tailored his programs to be approachable: He played brief, showstopping works by Paganini, for example, as a way to woo listeners. He said he was quick to adapt depending on who stopped to listen. When he spotted some children, he even broke into \"Old MacDonald Had a Farm.\"</p><p>\"I just go with it,\" he said.</p><p>As the Kaufman center tries to find ways to engage New Yorkers, other institutions are doing the same during this challenging time. The New York Philharmonic said it plans to bring back its Bandwagon series this spring. The orchestra also intends to announce a new streaming service in February.</p><p>Meanwhile, for those who catch the Kaufman series, the chance musical encounters are proving to be meaningful. Steven Brinberg, an Upper West Side resident, was walking by the storefront location last week and saw the performance by Ms. Williams.</p><p>He said he has missed going to live events, adding that before the pandemic he attended performances most nights. So, hearing an opera singer, even one singing behind a window, reminded him of the New York he knows and loves. \"I was standing there riveted,\" he said.</p>",
