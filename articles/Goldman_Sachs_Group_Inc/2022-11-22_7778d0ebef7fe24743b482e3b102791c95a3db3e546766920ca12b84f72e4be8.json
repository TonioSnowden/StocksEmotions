  "title": "Goldman Sachs to Pay $4 Million to Settle Investigation Over ESG Funds; Asset-management arm failed to always screen investments as plans required, SEC says",
  "text": "<p>The SEC said the misconduct was related to the Goldman Sachs International Equity ESG fund, the ESG Emerging Markets Equity fund, and a U.S. equities ESG strategy it offered to clients whose money it managed. Goldman's compliance policy said investment analysts would use a questionnaire to screen investments before adding them to funds or other portfolios, but the forms weren't always completed before stocks were added, the SEC said.</p><p>The questionnaire generated a numerical score used to grade companies on ESG factors that was then weighted based on the company's industry, the SEC said. Certain companies weren't allowed to be included, such as those that earned most of their revenue from selling alcohol, tobacco, weapons and other products.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported in June that SEC officials were probing Goldman's ESG business. The SEC in early 2021 formed a task force to sift through public data and tips for potential enforcement cases related to greenwashing—making deceptive or empty claims about environmental or social values—or other misconduct related to ESG practices.</p><p>\"Today's action reinforces that investment advisers must develop and adhere to their policies and procedures over their investment processes, including ESG research, to ensure investors receive the advisory services they would expect to receive from an ESG investment,\" said Andrew Dean, co-chief of the SEC's asset-management unit within its enforcement division.</p><p>Goldman said in a statement it was pleased to resolve the investigation. Goldman said that by February 2020, its analysts had completed the ESG questionnaires provided by its policies and procedures for all the stocks in those portfolios.</p><p>Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com</p><p>Goldman Sachs to Pay $4 Million to Settle Investigation Over ESG Funds</p>",
