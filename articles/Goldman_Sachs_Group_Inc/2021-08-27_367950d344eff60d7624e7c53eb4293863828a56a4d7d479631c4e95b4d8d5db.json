  "title": "Barclays strikes $3.8bn Gap card deal in US expansion",
  "text": "<p>Barclays agreed to buy a $3.8bn credit card portfolio linked to clothing retailer Gap, as the British lender continues to expand its subscale US consumer operation that offers better growth prospects than its home market.</p> <p>On Friday, Barclays announced the deal to acquire the customer accounts and receivables from Synchrony Bank in a transaction expected to close next year. It follows an April agreement to start issuing co-branded cards with Gap next year.</p> <p>While better known for his staunch defence of Barclays' controversial investment bank, chief executive Jes Staley has made the US cards business a core part of his strategy to turn round the UK lender he has run for almost six years.</p> <p>Credit cards also provide much-needed fee income to offset lost earnings from ultra-low global interest rates, which are squeezing margins on mortgages and business loans.</p> <p>Barclays has been aggressively expanding in recent years. In October, it poached the AARP account from rival JPMorgan Chase, winning the right to issue cards for the senior citizen lobby group and acquiring an existing $800m card portfolio.</p> <p>The acquisitions build on existing partnerships with American Airlines, New York carrier JetBlue and the Wyndham Hotels chain. However, Barclays suffered a blow in September when Apple <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2d7051f8-4f51-11e9-b401-8d9ef1626294\">moved</a> its branded card to Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>Barclays prefers to issue cards through partners in the US — rather than under its own brand as in the UK — because it lacks the same name recognition as larger rivals such as Chase, Citigroup and Discover. Internal polling indicates only around 1 per cent of US consumers are independently aware of Barclays as a banking brand, a person familiar with the matter said.</p> <p>Still, even after the Gap deal, Barclays remains a relative minnow in the US market. Its $20bn of assets and 10m customers place it as the ninth largest card provider in the country, far below market leaders Chase and Citi, which have more $100bn in card balances.</p> <p>“We do think the US market is a huge growth opportunity for the firm and transactions like this demonstrate it,” said Denny Nealon, CEO of US consumer banking. “We are small compared to Citi and Chase, but top five in co-branding. We are in the next group down trying to climb and steal share.”</p> <p>The US economy has recovered faster than most other countries from the Covid-19 shock. Barclays' US card balances surged 21 per cent in the second quarter of 2021 versus the first as spending rebounded almost to 2019 levels. This meant the reduction in balances year-on-year was only 9 per cent, down to $20.1bn.</p> <p>“The US consumer is returning to their historic use of credit cards and receivables . . . we're seeing a much more rapid recovery in balances there,” CEO Staley said last month at the lender's half-year results. “There's a dynamic in that business which we like a lot.”</p> <p>However in the UK, Barclays' card balances have fallen more sharply and spending remains depressed. Card balances dropped a further £300m in the second quarter from the first, and have fallen 26 per cent to £9.6bn from £12.9bn at the end of June last year.</p> <p>“In the UK, it's a slightly different story,” Staley said. “The UK consumer has demonstrated a little bit more focus on balance sheet [reduction] . . . and there is a degree of a shift from unsecured borrowing to secured borrowing” such as mortgages.&#xa0;</p> <p>However, headwinds remain in the cards sector. The amount banks are earning from interest on outstanding balances is falling as customers use savings built up during the pandemic to pay down card borrowings quicker.</p> <p>Additionally, credit card usage is coming under pressure from buy now, pay later companies such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb862e18-aaff-47be-9e68-d988614ef433\">Klarna and Afterpay</a>, which are especially popular with younger consumers.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/buy-now-pay-later-five-business-models-to-compete\">McKinsey estimates</a> that in the past two years, start-up fintechs have poached as much as $10bn of revenue from banks with their point-of-sale (POS) financing services.</p><p>Source: Stephen Morris, Banking Editor 2021 'Barclays strikes $3.8bn Gap card deal in US expansion' FT.com 27 August.
