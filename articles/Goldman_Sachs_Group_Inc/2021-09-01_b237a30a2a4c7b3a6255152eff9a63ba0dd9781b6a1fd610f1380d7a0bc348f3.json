  "title": "Investors Push Rents For Houses Higher",
  "text": "<p>The sharp rise partly reflects demand from people who can't afford to buy homes as well as city-dwellers who moved to the suburbs to rent during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the supply of new houses continues to trail historical levels relative to population growth, and builders in some places remain constrained by zoning laws and available land.</p><p>Price increases are more moderate for single-family tenants renewing their leases, said Haendel St. Juste, a real-estate securities analyst at Mizuho Securities USA. \"You've got to be careful in this industry. You can't be perceived as gouging,\" he said.</p><p>Apartment asking rents also have risen, but at a slower pace: 8.3% for the year to date through July, Yardi Matrix said. The difference partly reflects weaker demand in downtowns that lost population after Covid-19 hit, although those markets have rebounded in recent months.</p><p>Many rental-apartment landlords were hurt during the pandemic by eviction moratoriums and unpaid rent. Some of the largest single-family operators, which target six-figure income households, are more insulated from these problems. But some continued to file evictions, catching attention from lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives, who said in July they would investigate.</p><p>For investors, the single-family home market has been heralded as a pandemic success story. Shares of the two largest companies, Invitation Homes Inc. and American Homes 4 Rent, climbed 38% since late February of 2020, compared with about 10% for the largest apartment companies, according to real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors.</p><p>Investors purchased $87 billion in homes in the first half of 2021, according to real-estate company Redfin, including a record 68,000 houses in the second quarter.</p><p>Since June, Blackstone Group Inc., Invesco Ltd. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alone have committed more than $11 billion to the sector. Meanwhile, other companies are building rental homes from scratch. New houses meant to be rented instead of sold account for about 12% of single-family construction in 2021, said Doug Ressler, a researcher at Yardi.</p><p>Tricon Residential Inc., a publicly traded house owner, reported new lease rent increases of around 21% in July, a record for the company. The average increase was 5% for renewal tenants. In an August earnings call, Gary Berman, Tricon's chief executive, said in some markets, the company could fetch close to 10% rent increases for existing tenants if it didn't intentionally \"hold back.\"</p><p>Tricon launched a $5 billion fund this summer to acquire 18,000 more houses and convert them into rentals. It is also purchasing new construction homes through a separate venture. \"What we tell prospective investors is look, we can't satisfy the demand. We need a lot more supply,\" Mr. Berman said.</p><p>Deep-pocketed investors may have a hand in would-be buyer woes: one in six home sales went to an investor in the second quarter of 2021, according to Redfin.</p>",
