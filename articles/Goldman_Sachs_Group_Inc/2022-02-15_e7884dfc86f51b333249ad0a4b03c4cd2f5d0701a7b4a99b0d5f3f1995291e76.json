We look forward to hearing from you!</p> <h2>Peter Thiel's new gambit in Washington</h2> <p>Historically, rubbing elbows with billionaires such as the late casino magnate <strong>Sheldon Adelson</strong>, hedge fund magnate <strong>Ken Griffin</strong>, and mega donor <strong>Koch</strong> brothers could be make or break for aspiring Republican candidates on the fundraiser circuit.</p> <p>This year, however, the hottest invite was for cocktails and canapés at <strong>Peter Thiel</strong>'s <a href=\"https://therealdeal.com/miami/2021/01/22/paypal-co-founder-peter-thiel-revealed-as-buyer-of-miami-beach-mansions/\">Miami Beach mansion</a>, where the contrarian Silicon Valley investor recently held a fundraiser for <strong>Harriet Hageman</strong>, who has Donald Trump's backing in contesting <strong>Liz Cheney</strong>'s Republican Wyoming congressional seat. (Cheney voted to impeach the former president last year.)</p> <p>Thiel will have more time than ever on his hands to provide a platform for candidates at his New York, Washington and Florida homes since announcing last week that he is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/82774b98-965d-4ed8-9876-cd250ed1448c\">stepping down</a> from the board of <strong>Facebook</strong>'s owner <strong>Meta</strong>.</p> <p>The billionaire tech mogul, who is known as Silicon Valley's most prominent Trump supporter, has made the decision to focus on “political endeavours” and “avoid that being a distraction for Facebook”, a person familiar with his thinking told the FT.&#xa0;</p> <p>Unchained from the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76d40aac-034e-4e0b-95eb-c5d34146f647\">budding metaverse</a>, Thiel plans to focus his support on Republicans aligned with Trump's agenda. In the Arizona Senate primary, Thiel has spent $10mn backing <strong>Blake Masters</strong>, who helped co-author Thiel's manual <em>Zero to One</em> and heads up his private foundation.</p> <p>Thiel has put the same amount behind <em>Hillbilly Elegy </em>author and self-proclaimed “conservative outsider” <strong>JD Vance</strong>, a former investor at Thiel's <strong>Mithril Capital</strong>, who is running for an Ohio Senate seat.</p> <p>From the outside, one could make the conclusion that Thiel's more intentional move towards politics stems from disenchantment with the tech realm that he has dominated for decades. After founding <strong>PayPal</strong>, he went on to launch <strong>Palantir</strong>, the controversial surveillance software developer-slash-consultancy whose work for the national security establishment has ruffled feathers with civil liberties activists.</p> <p>Thiel's continued public association with Palantir <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d445dacd-5829-4080-80b2-33616b0e4e94\">had become a source of frustration</a> within the company however, insiders told the FT, given his increasing alignment with Trump leading up to the 2016 election. His reputation as Silicon Valley's black sheep only intensified over the next four years, as venture capitalists and tech start-ups <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2dcf2be-a850-11e6-8898-79a99e2a4de6\">distanced themselves</a> from the Trump White House.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2259cd1-704d-4cd4-814d-994c4e754695\">that's not the whole story</a>, as our colleagues Richard Waters and Lauren Fedor write. Thiel has long argued that tech start-ups have abandoned innovation in favour of assimilation. “We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters,” the <a href=\"https://foundersfund.com/the-future/\">manifesto</a> of Thiel's Founders Fund decried over a decade ago.</p> <p>The German-born <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8537d776-664f-11e3-aa10-00144feabdc0\">chess prodigy</a> intends on playing a similar gambit in Washington that he did in Silicon Valley.</p> <p>“He looks at the Republican party and says, ‘This institution is frozen in time',” said an acquaintance of Thiel's in Washington. The more he can shake up the establishment, the more he stands to gain.</p> <h2>Beijing sets fire to a vape queen's empire</h2> <p>Earlier this month, employees at Chinese tobacco flavouring maker <strong>Huabao </strong>rang in the lunar new year with <em>hongbao</em> — the tradition of red envelopes, typically containing cash, given for good luck and prosperity.</p> <p>The Year of the Tiger, which symbolises bravery, has come at an opportune time as the company faces what can only be described as a complete disaster — an investigation into its billionaire founder <strong>Chu Lam Yiu</strong> that has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57d5b0b7-d55f-42c3-bdc7-30640df63da0\">wiped $5bn</a> off the value of two of the group's listed companies since it was disclosed in January.</p> <p>Chu, once hailed as one of China's richest self-made women, was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a3a597b-38d3-462f-adf9-63011845455e\">placed under investigation</a> in January for “suspected disciplinary violations”. She is being held in “residential surveillance”, a form of off-grid detention used by the Chinese Communist party that has been criticised by human rights groups for lacking due process. Her son<strong> Lam Ka Yu</strong>, who was named co-chair of one of his mother's companies in June, was also detained.</p> <p>The probe into the reclusive Sichuanese billionaire has played out alongside the relentless drive by China's president<strong> Xi Jinping</strong> for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87c3aa02-f970-48c8-b795-82768c9f7634\">“common prosperity”</a> — a campaign to clamp down on everything from big business to technology and the entrepreneurs who profit most from it — as he cements a historic third term.</p> <p>Though Beijing's corporate clampdown left Chu's fortune up in smoke, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e585fd7-4fe3-4b77-af33-e8481fc2e911\">it's unlikely</a> that the government will set fire to an entire industry, our FT colleagues write.</p> <p>Tobacco is one of the Communist party's biggest tax generators. The state-backed powerful <strong>China National Tobacco Corp</strong> enjoys a tight monopoly over the $235bn sector, and weaning China's 300mn smokers off cigarettes — beneficial to common prosperity as that may be — would leave a big hole in the government's pocket.</p> <p>Vaping companies present <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/57d5b0b7-d55f-42c3-bdc7-30640df63da0\">a more advantageous target</a> for a statewide crackdown, as Lex has noted.</p> <p>Groups like Huabao until recently have reaped huge profits due to loose rules. But the vaping industry's days of puffing along unperturbed appear over after falling squarely in Beijing's crosshairs.</p> <h2>Are hedge funds the new venture capitalists?</h2> <p>As DD <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a850ee0f-5feb-410e-bde8-46e5dd15fadf\">has written before</a>, traditional venture capital firms are no longer the only ones mining for Silicon Valley's next gem.</p> <p>The New York-based investment firm <strong>Tiger Global Management </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54bb342c-230f-4438-a4d7-7cbde010ea1a\">has spearheaded</a> a new league of investors betting huge sums on unlisted companies, along with its rivals <strong>Coatue Management</strong> and <strong>Altimeter Capital Management</strong>. </p> <p>Hedge funds including <strong>Dan Loeb</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23f71be9-3749-408c-8e92-059cdf2b8f46\"><strong>Third Point</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a28fa095-0112-4dc5-9eee-8464a2e77ec7\"><strong>Marshall Wace</strong></a> have also swooped in to challenge the turf of growth equity investors, launching “crossover” funds that invest in private firms ahead of potential public listings and then hold on to their positions.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/84c93190-ae82-40cf-91e2-fee354c8c97a\">That trend</a> could soon become the norm,<strong> Dmitry Balyasny</strong>, head of one of the largest US hedge funds, told DD's Miles Kruppa, as the divisions between private and public markets wear increasingly thin.</p> <p>“The line between public and private is an artificial line that creates different types of investors, and that creates opportunity,” he said.</p> <p>Balyasny recently hired 10 people including former Coatue partner <strong>Jamie McGurk</strong> and <strong>Glade Brook Capital Partners</strong> alum <strong>JP Van Arsdale</strong> to lead its new private investment unit. The team has already amassed stakes in some of the largest unlisted companies including <strong>Databricks</strong> and<strong> Klarna</strong>.</p> <p>The only catch? Unlike its typical public market investments, private tech positions are far harder to sell if market conditions worsen.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Tata Group</strong> <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Transportation/Air-India-taps-former-Turkish-Airlines-chief-as-new-CEO\">has appointed</a> former <strong>Turkish Airlines</strong> chair <strong>IIker Ayci</strong> as chief executive and managing director of Air India, the debt-laden national carrier that it <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87c179ea-5cfd-4417-b092-9ce2afa8a099\">took over</a> from the government last month, per Nikkei Asia.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Private equity firm <strong>Percheron Capital</strong> has named <strong>Priya Saraswati</strong> as head of business development. She was previously director of business development at <strong>Vista Equity Partners</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads</h2> <p><strong>Inside scoop </strong>The resignation of CNN president Jeff Zucker proceeded more than just an undisclosed romantic relationship with another executive. Some point to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/clashing-executives-office-romance-angry-anchors-inside-the-week-that-shook-cnn-11644581416?mod=hp_lead_pos7\">his rivalry with WarnerMedia's chief</a> as a sign that he could have been forced out unfairly, The Wall Street Journal reports.</p> <p><strong>Out of the shadows </strong>One of Goldman Sachs' most notorious bankers <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-14/goldman-s-most-notorious-banker-turns-star-witness-in-1mdb-trial?sref=OziMsGoK\">will re-enter the spotlight</a> as a crucial witness in the trial against his former subordinate Roger Ng. But both could face decades in prison for their respective roles in the 1MDB scandal, Bloomberg reports.</p> <p><strong>Slack to reality </strong>Toxic coworkers will no longer be mutable as companies migrate back to the office. But face-to-face interaction <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd9d39f8-2861-4c99-809e-6a198dd7c4ee\">could be just the thing</a> to clear the air, the FT writes.</p> <h2>News round-up</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/025e7678-ced9-4c53-aa17-c539d621bde7\">Architects of ‘Texas two-step' lambast J&amp;J for its use of the manoeuvre</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d12b19ad-9c0b-4ebc-8598-f936862c0044\">Former Goldman Sachs banker to stand trial over 1MDB scandal</a> (FT) </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/amd-closes-biggest-chip-acquisition-with-498-bln-purchase-xilinx-2022-02-14/\">AMD closes record chip industry deal with about $50bn purchase of Xilinx</a> (Reuters) </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-near-roughly-6-billion-deal-to-buy-tower-semiconductor-11644876391\">Intel nears roughly $6bn deal to buy Tower Semiconductor</a> (WSJ) </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09c4e4b7-3631-4e00-8455-11b07f9b8012\">Trump accountant says financial statements should ‘no longer be relied upon'</a> (FT) </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/29cbb67e-5e06-4eef-a9dd-a46379b9f8da\">How SoftBank's costly bet on the ‘internet of things' backfired at Arm</a> (FT) </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/19f84556-3ca8-4e62-9a7f-1e880260e1e5\">Crown Resorts recommends Blackstone's $6.4bn bid</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c0a4be1-b2bc-4bad-a4d6-78d2bdd6b4ef\">Activist investor sets out plan for Glencore coal demerger</a> (FT) </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ceb4116a-ce1f-4501-8b5c-413810ebb1e7\">Lockheed drops deal for rocket engine maker after US legal challenge</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ba2a417-83c2-4ad5-b6e8-2f99af471e66\">JD Sports and Footasylum fined for sharing information after merger blocked</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/034ef665-6604-4cb9-b1af-b09e8b5ede39\">New Peloton chief dismisses suggestions company will be sold</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/428f6d3b-d100-4212-9d6e-8e40f089ae67\">HSBC trims private bank staff and reduces office space in Switzerland</a> (FT)</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-14/axis-bank-set-to-buy-citigroup-s-2-5-billion-india-retail-unit?srnd=deals&amp;sref=OziMsGoK\">Axis Bank set to buy Citigroup's $2.5bn India retail unit</a> (Bloomberg) </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b593a6d3-1a9a-4cba-9fe5-7119d3de12da?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">Merger arbitrage: busted rocket deal shows hedge funds the opportunity in antitrust risk</a> (Lex) </p><p>Source:  2022 'Metaverse to MAGAverse: Peter Thiel's political odyssey ' FT.com 15 February.
