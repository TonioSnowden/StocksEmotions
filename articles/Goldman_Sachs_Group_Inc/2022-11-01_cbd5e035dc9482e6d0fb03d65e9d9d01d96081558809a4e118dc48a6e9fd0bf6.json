  "title": "U.S. Job Openings Rose in September in a Still-Tight Labor Market; Demand for workers remains elevated with job postings far outpacing number of unemployed people looking for work",
  "text": "<p>The increase in openings and other figures in the Labor Department's report on hiring demand and job turnover added to signs of a healthy labor market that has cooled slightly compared with the first half of the year. Payroll growth slowed in September but was still strong. Pay and benefits increases rose rapidly in the third quarter but at a similar pace as the prior quarter. Jobless claims have remained low as employers hold on to workers.</p><p>The overall economy, whilelosing some momentum, is also still growing. The Federal Reserve is expected to increase interest rates again this week as it attempts to cool the economy and tame inflation runningnear a four-decade high.</p><p>Employers' total job openings increased 437,000 to a seasonally adjusted 10.7 million in September from an upwardly revised 10.3 million openings the prior month, the Labor Department said Tuesday. September openings were well above the 5.8 million unemployed people seeking workâ€”an imbalance that is putting pressure on wages and overall inflation.</p><p>Job openings peaked in March at 11.9 million and have since declined in four of the past six months through September. Openings remain elevated compared with a 7.2 million average in 2019 ahead of the pandemic.</p><p>U.S. stocks slipped on Tuesday after the tight labor-market reading added to worries about aggressive interest-rate decisions by the Fed.</p><p>Other figures in the Labor Department report pointed to a tight labor market. The number of times workers quit their jobs remained elevated in September but fell slightly to 4.1 million, down from a 4.5 million peak in November 2021.</p><p>Layoffs edged down to 1.3 million, the department said, a total that was below the 2019 average.</p><p>Food services, entertainment, education, healthcare and federal government job openings drove the September increase, the Labor Department said. Manufacturing and financial activities were among a handful of industries that saw a decline.</p><p>\"Some sectors are going through a period of retrenchment while others are still trying to bounce back from the pandemic,\" said Nick Bunker, an economist at jobs site Indeed. \"By all the key metrics in this report, the labor market is resilient.\"</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is your business doing to attract and retain workers? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Indeed estimated that openings totaled around 10 million in mid-October, a decline from September's level. Indeed data show that roles in the technology industry, such as insoftware development and marketing, saw postings decline the most this year through the middle of last month.</p><p>Companies in technology, real estate and financial services, which are sensitive to higher interest rates, such asMeta Platforms Inc., Goldman Sachs andRedfin Corp., have laid off workers or announced plans to trim staff this year.</p><p>Hiring was stable in the manufacturing sector, according to separate October surveys of purchasing managers by the Institute for Supply Management and S&amp;P Global released Tuesday. However, S&amp;P noted that \"cost-cutting measures, uncertainty regarding future demand, and lower production requirements led to only a modest rise in employment.\"</p><p>Employers in industries that typically struggle to hire enough workers, such as healthcare and education, will continue to add jobs but eventually slow the pace of hiring if the economy weakens further, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon.</p><p>\"There's unlikely to be a sector in which employment will continue to grow very strongly. It may still see growth, but at a more subdued pace,\" Mr. Daco said. He added that labor demand already has shown early signs of softening as companies anticipate a recession and try to limit labor costs without laying off workers.</p><p>\"There is increased caution and discretion among business executives in their talent-management decisions like more hiring freezes or perhaps making less of an effort to keep employees who might want to leave,\" Mr. Daco said.</p><p>Ford Motor Co. asked white-collar employees deemed to be underperforming to choose between takinga severance package or improving performance.</p><p>For some leisure and hospitality businesses, hiring remains difficult. Robert Lindo, vice president and director at Casino M8trix, a gambling and entertainment venue in San Jose, Calif., said his company of about 610 workers has about 80 job openings.</p><p>Mr. Lindo said it has been difficult to hire servers, bartenders, line cooks and security officers, causing the company to reduce the amount of food options it serves and open fewer tables.</p><p>\"There are just no responses to posts for some of the open positions, so wage increases are constantly in consideration,\" Mr. Lindo said. He added that the high cost of living in the San Francisco Bay Area and the proximity of tech companies that typically pay their hourly workers more adds to his challenge in competing for workers.</p><p>Write to Bryan Mena at bryan.mena@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Job Openings Rose in September in a Still-Tight Labor Market</p>",
