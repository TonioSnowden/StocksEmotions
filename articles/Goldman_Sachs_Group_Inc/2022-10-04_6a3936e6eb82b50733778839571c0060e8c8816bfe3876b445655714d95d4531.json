Analysts are currently forecasting third-quarter earnings of $2.93 a share for JPMorgan, according to FactSet data.</p><p>\"We believe a 3Q earnings beat on the top line will lead to upward revisions on full-year guidance and imply a better run-rate into 2023,\" Horowitz said.</p><p>Also Read: Credit Suisse woes prompt calls to analysts asking if U.S. banks risk a 'contagion impact'</p><p>Citi expects JPMorgan to revise upward its outlook for net interest income, which is the profit generated from issuing loans at a higher interest rate than it pays customers for their deposits.</p><p>\"They have been more disciplined than others on being patient to deploy cash, and now have the opportunity to extend duration at higher rates,\" Horowitz said of JPMorgan.</p><p>Citi also upgraded Bank of New York Mellon Corp. to buy from neutral on expectations for strong net interest income as well as high return of capital, with expense control by its new management team.</p><p>\"BK remains in a very strong position from a capital perspective and net interest income outlook, partly offset by headwinds on fees,\" Horowitz said.</p><p>Citi also cut its rating on M&amp;T Bank Corp.
