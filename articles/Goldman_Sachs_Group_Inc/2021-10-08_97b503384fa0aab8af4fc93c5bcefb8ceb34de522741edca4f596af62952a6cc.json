  "title": "15 Women Shaping Private Equity's Present and Future; The honorees on our 2021 Women to Watch list include professionals from a diverse range of investment strategies and career backgrounds",
  "text": "<p>Each year since 2015, Private Equity Analyst has honored a different group of women who have risen through the professional ranks of their respective firms, or even launched firms themselves. This year's honorees have proven their deal-making chops across various industries, including technology, business services, consumer, media, entertainment and healthcare. Many have also stood out as leaders in mentoring and cultivating talent not only at their respective firms but across the industry itself.</p><p>Veena Isaac, Managing Director, BlackRock Inc.</p><p>Veena Isaac joined BlackRock Inc. to build out its secondary practice in 2019. She previously worked at Jasper Ridge Partners LP, which provides investment services to families and other institutional investors, and investment manager Pantheon Ventures and considers herself pretty entrepreneurial. According to Ms. Isaac, her three most recent roles afforded her the opportunity to \"wear a lot of hats because the teams were always very new and it was always at the point of building out the business.\" While setting up the secondary practice at BlackRock, Ms. Isaac was involved in building the model, putting in place processes, screening transactions and executing them, working with internal teams and building relationships with external managers. \"One of the things I learned while I was at the family office is that relationships can make a huge difference in terms of how a deal gets shaped and how it moves forward,\" Ms. Isaac said. Working at smaller firms taught her the value of being proactive, and together with the emphasis on relationships, \"with the benefit of BlackRock's brand, it's been helpful in us being able to participate and be a preferred buyer in a lot of the situations,\" Ms. Isaac said. Ms. Isaac, a mother of three, loves to cook and is learning to play the piano with her twin boys.</p><p>Megan Austin Karlen, Partner, Francisco Partners</p><p>Megan Austin Karlen is a partner at technology-focused firm Francisco Partners, where she leads the capital-markets functions. Since joining Francisco in 2016, she has helped to grow the firm's capital-markets practice, was promoted to partner and recently joined its investment committee. She is Francisco's first-ever head of capital markets, where she oversees the firm's activities including new investments and capital-markets activities for portfolio companies. This includes structuring debt solutions, finding financing partners and negotiating term sheets and credit agreements. Dipanjan Deb, a co-founder and the chief executive at Francisco, said Ms. Karlen stepped into an \"amorphous role with confidence and persistence.\" He added that she is a \"hugely valued member of the team\" for her accomplishments in the capital-markets practice, as well as for her \"contributions to the firm and our culture.\" Before joining Francisco, Ms. Karlen was the vice president of business development at predictive marketing software provider Radius Intelligence Inc. and vice president of business development at payments infrastructure company CardSpring. Previous to these roles, she was a vice president at private-equity firm Castle Harlan Inc., with a focus on investments in the telecommunications, distribution and consumer industries.</p><p>Tannaz Chapman, Managing Director, Levine Leichtman Capital Partners</p><p>Tannaz Chapman oversees all stages of the investments that midmarket-focused Levine Leichtman Capital Partners makes across the business-services, education and consumer-product sectors. Her \"even-keeled personality,\" as well as her \"deep and comprehensive approach to investment,\" are particularly valuable during the analysis of a deal, the private-equity firm said. Ms. Chapman also has been instrumental in some of the firm's exits. For example, she led the sale of luxury brand Sferra Fine Linens LLC to private-equity peer Highlander Partners in 2018, five years after Levine Leichtman backed the Edison, N.J.-based linen maker. Ms. Chapman mentors junior professionals and is helping increase diversity at Levine Leichtman's team, the firm said. Before moving to Los Angeles from Chicago with her family to join the firm in 2016, she worked at online financial-services company Enova International Inc. and at private-equity manager GTCR. Ms. Chapman received her master's in business administration from Harvard Business School.</p><p>Maud Brown, Partner, PAI Partners</p><p>Maud Brown spent 18 years across the London and New York offices of Investcorp before joining PAI Partners in 2019 to lead the Paris-based firm's New York office. At Investcorp, she led deals involving companies that include enterprise software company Pro Unlimited Inc. and private education provider Nobel Learning Communities Inc., among other companies. She has already made her mark at PAI, playing an instrumental role in the firm's largest North American deal to date: a joint venture formed with PepsiCo. Inc. that allows PAI to acquire a majority stake in Pepsi's juice businesses. \"We've shown with this transaction that we can embrace ambitious and complicated deals,\" Ms. Brown said of the deal. As she leads PAI's push in North America, Ms. Brown says the most successful leaders often remain as open as possible to listening to other peoples' perspectives. \"I value as much the opinion of senior partners as the junior [professionals] who are closest to some aspects of deals and bring incredible input,\" she said.</p><p>Jennifer Hoh, Managing Director, Providence Equity Partners</p><p>Jennifer Hoh joined Providence Equity Partners in 2014 and was promoted to managing director earlier this year. Ms. Hoh focuses her investing on the software, services and technology sectors and is seen as an integral part of Providence's deal team and a senior leader within the firm, according to her nomination. Recently, Ms. Hoh played a critical role in the firm's investment in sports entertainment company Topgolf International Inc., which she helped usher through significant operational challenges it faced as a result of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. She was also instrumental in its recent merger with publicly traded golf business Callaway Golf Co. David Phillips, a senior managing director and co-head of North America for Providence, noted that Ms. Hoh has \"significant expertise, composure and compassion, all of which make her an incredibly effective deal maker and vital part of the overall fabric of Providence.\" Ms. Hoh champions women's development and is a member of Providence's women's roundtable, where she serves as a mentor to younger members of the firm. She is also on Providence's environmental, social and governance and diversity and inclusion committees, helping the firm institutionalize its diligence process for ESG factors.</p><p>Laura Held, Partner, Shamrock Capital Advisors</p><p>Laura Held admits that her career path to partner role at media- and entertainment-focused firm Shamrock Capital Advisors wasn't the \"most linear\" one. After working in investment banking and an early stint in private equity, Ms. Held left for the West Coast to work in the corporate strategy group at Walt Disney Co. It was there that she began to hone her sector expertise before joining Shamrock in 2012, where she has held board positions on portfolio companies that include Bayard Advertising Agency Inc., Adweek, Wpromote LLC, Mobilitie LLC, Questex LLC and RBmedia. Her colleagues say that in addition to her investment acumen, Ms. Held is a sought-after mentor who is widely admired across the firm. Ms. Held says she feels mentorship is important for the future both of Shamrock and the industry at large. \"People learn by doing, so making sure that you give people an opportunity to try things themselves, even if it's outside of their comfort zone,\" is important, she said.</p><p>Megan Preiner, Managing Director, Thomas H. Lee Partners</p><p>Megan Preiner, a managing director at Thomas H. Lee Partners, has played a leading role in developing the firm's healthcare platform and making it one of the most active areas of investment. She originally started her career as an analyst in Credit Suisse Group, focused on media and telecommunications, before joining THL in 2008. Since that time, she has continued to impress Managing Director Josh Nelson, the head of the healthcare vertical, with her level of expertise and knowledge as an investor. He noted that Ms. Preiner is \"deeply committed to investing in businesses that improve the healthcare ecosystem, and she is passionate about the positive outcomes they achieve.\" Over the course of the past year, Ms. Preiner led investments in three new healthcare services companies. She currently is a director of specialty contract development and manufacturing organization Adare Pharma Solutions, applied behavioral analysis services provider Autism Home Care Holdings Inc. and care-management services provider Senior Home Care Holdings Inc., among others. Ms. Preiner earned a bachelor's degree in political economy from Georgetown University and a master's in business administration from Harvard Business School.</p><p>Kate Richard, Founder and Chief Executive, Warwick Investment Group</p><p>Kate Richard is a rare case of a female leader of an energy-focused private-equity firm. She said, however, that she doesn't think much about it. \"The impact will be on those who work under me more than on me,\" she said. To make sure all the ones who work for her are heard, Ms. Richard acknowledges that there are dominant and nondominant ways of communicating, a concept she learned at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where she worked on private-equity investments in real estate. She said she constantly asks herself: \"Are we in a consensus-building mode or are we in the mode where the team needs direction?\" The question is increasingly important as Oklahoma City-based Warwick Investment Group has expanded beyond its oil-and-gas roots in recent years to also pursue real-estate investments in the U.K. The biggest challenge of leading a global firm, Ms. Richard said, is to ensure that the people who are closest to you or have worked the longest with you—or have the loudest voice—don't get the biggest say. \"It's really about making sure that you're still listening to the best ideas.\"</p><p>Women to Watch: The Next Generation</p><p>For years, our Women to Watch list hasn't restricted itself to senior leadership in the industry. We have also sought to showcase some of the rising stars among investment professionals who are well on their way to establishing the next generation of industry leadership.</p><p>Tracy Vo, Principal, Private Equity, Apollo Global Management Inc.</p><p>A rising deal maker for Apollo Global Management Inc.'s private-equity team, Tracy Vo has been integral to several key acquisitions since joining the firm in 2019. She was a principal on Apollo's take-private of home builder New Home Co., and is continuing to play a strategic role in expanding the business, working with Apollo's real-estate and credit arms. She has also been on the deal teams for technology company Intrado Corp. and digital-imaging company Shutterfly, where she sits on the board of directors and led the company's acquisition of home-décor marketplace Spoonflower. Before joining Apollo, Ms. Vo was a vice president with Cerberus Capital Management and began her career as an analyst in Credit Suisse Group's financial-sponsors group. She graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University with a bachelor's degree in economics.</p><p>Grace Mollard, Principal, Private Equity, Bain Capital</p><p>Grace Mollard joined Bain Capital in 2016 after working at consulting firm Boston Consulting Group and later earning her master's in business administration from Harvard Business School. \"I think it was really formative because I had a lot of time working within companies that were trying to do really incredible things strategically and make really big moves as the world changed around them,\" Ms. Mollard said. A principal in the consumer, retail and restaurant practice at Bain, Ms. Mollard has played a leading role in some of the firm's significant consumer-facing businesses including a $3.5 billion acquisition of airline company Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. last year. This year, Ms. Mollard quarterbacked Bain's acquisition of North American dessert company Dessert Holdings, where she now serves as a director. Ms. Mollard is the lead singer in Bain's band. She also loves to travel and spends hours in local grocery stores during her travels. \"I tell myself it's for work, but I just love to experience how different they are in various geographies.\"</p><p>Namrita Rai, Vice President, Providence Strategic Growth Capital Partners</p><p>A vice president in Providence Strategic Growth Capital Partners' Boston office, Namrita Rai has worked on several acquisitions of business-to-business software companies. They include e-commerce technology company Assembly, hospitality-software company SevenRooms and visitor-management software company Sign In App Ltd., among others. Ms. Rai is also a mentor to women at the firm, assists with its recruiting efforts and recently took part in PSG's roundtable on women in private equity. Before Providence Strategic Growth, Ms. Rai worked for Arrowmark Partners and Oaktree Capital Management, and she began her career in the mergers-and-acquisitions group of RBC Capital Markets. She received a bachelor's in economics from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Sophia Popova, Principal, Summit Partners</p><p>Sophia Popova built her technology investment acumen even before she joined the ranks of Summit Partners in 2017. She held product-management or business-development roles at startups that included Contactive, a communications technology company that was acquired by Fuze Inc. in 2015, and Recombine Inc., a clinical genetic testing company that was bought by a unit of Cooper Cos. in 2016, according to her nomination. At Harvard Business School, where she received an M.B.A., Ms. Popova served as an investment partner of Dorm Room Fund, which provides seed funding for student-founded startups. Although she only joined Summit in 2017, Ms. Popova has played an active role in five of the firm's deals, representing more than $600 million of invested capital. The companies include data and marketing software-as-a-service provider Klaviyo Inc.; Markforged, an industrial design and 3-D printing software company that went public earlier this year; and logistics data science provider Sifted LLC. Ms. Popova is also deeply involved in associate training and development at the firm, according to her nomination.</p><p>Tara Gadgil, Principal, Thoma Bravo</p><p>Since joining Thoma Bravo, Tara Gadgil has helped lead the technology-focused firm's investments in application software, specializing in software companies serving users in real estate, healthcare and energy. Among the major deals she has helped spearhead is the take-private of real-estate software and analytics company RealPage Inc., which at about $10.2 billion was the largest deal in Thoma Bravo's history at the time it closed this year. Earlier in her career, Ms. Gadgil worked at Berkshire Partners, TPG Growth and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Seeing the growing importance of software to the broader economy, and looking for a firm with the technical and operational expertise to distinguish itself from competitors, she joined Thoma Bravo in 2016. She credits the quality of mentorship at the firm, and its both entrepreneurial and collaborative culture, in spurring the success she's had. Thoma Bravo's partners \"really look to our generation to take the lead on these marquee deals,\" she said.</p><p>Lindsay Ting, Managing Director, Trilantic North America</p><p>Lindsay Ting joined Trilantic North America in 2019 and was recently promoted to managing director, a recognition by the private-equity firm of the important role she has been playing in its deals in the consumer sector. Among them was a new commitment to Sunrise Strategic Partners, a firm that backs emerging brands, and the sale of one such Sunrise-backed brand—pancake- and waffle-mix maker Kodiak Cakes LLC—to L Catterton earlier this year. Ms. Ting, who previously worked at other private-equity firms, initially focused on various industries but gravitated to the consumer sector over the years \"as relationships became more important\" to secure deals, she said. \"I love thinking about how consumers make purchasing decisions, how consumer preferences evolve and how different businesses get started to meet those needs.\" She had good mentors throughout her career but wished more of them were women. \"Having people above you that look like you certainly helps you to think you can achieve something,\" she said. However, she added that she believes gender diversity is increasing in the private-equity industry as she less often happens to be the only woman in a meeting room. \"I do see more and more women in the industry.\"</p><p>Caroline Dechert, Principal, Welsh Carson Anderson &amp; Stowe</p><p>Caroline Dechert is a principal at Welsh Carson Anderson &amp; Stowe, where she is a rising leader in the firm's healthcare practice. Working in private equity is somewhat of a \"happy accident,\" according to Ms. Dechert. Ms. Dechert—who is based in Welsh Carson's San Francisco office—studied journalism and economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with the original aim of being a broadcast journalist. She opted to move into business, working at the healthcare investment banking group at Morgan Stanley before joining Welsh Carson in 2012. Recently, Ms. Dechert played a leadership role in portfolio company InnovAge's initial public offering. Welsh Carson's investment in the healthcare delivery platform focused on dual-eligible seniors led to a 70% internal rate of return and reaped a return of 10.8-times the firm's invested capital, according to her nomination. D. Scott Mackesy, a managing partner at the firm, said that Ms. Dechert is \"one of our firm's brightest rising stars,\" noting that she \"builds strong relationships with management teams and is widely respected as a team player who enjoys mentoring many of our professionals.\" In addition to mentoring within the firm, she also leads Welsh Carson's partnership with Girls Who Invest, a nonprofit organization focused on increasing female representation in the asset-management industry.</p><p>—Compiled by Laura Cooper, Chris Cumming, Luis Garcia, Laura Kreutzer and Preeti Singh</p><p>15 Women Shaping Private Equity's Present and Future</p>",
