  "title": "World News: Beijing Reports Covid Deaths After a Lull",
  "text": "<p>The deaths and countrywide infections challenge recent moves by the top leadership to dial back some pandemic controls. The Chinese government ordered quarantine periods for inbound travelers to be shortened and lifted some mandatory quarantine requirements for close contacts of Covid patients.</p><p>At the same time, the central government has said it has no intention of abandoning its \"zero-Covid\" policy, only telling local officials to be more precise in its application to minimize damage to the country's economy. Still, the mixed messaging has sown confusion as many cities order citizens to take frequent Covid tests and more residential buildings are put into sudden and frequent lockdowns.</p><p>China reported an average of almost 22,000 new daily cases over the past seven days, more than half of which were found in China's southern economic hub of Guangdong province and the metropolis of Chongqing, government data showed.</p><p>Officials in major cities including Beijing and Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, have imposed fresh lockdowns and told residents to stay home. Schools in some parts of the country's capital returned to online classes on Monday. Ridership on subways in 19 major Chinese cities last week was about 25% below levels a year earlier, and about 90% lower in Chongqing, according to a Nov. 18 research note by Goldman Sachs.</p><p>Cities under full or partial lockdowns at the end of last week contributed more than half of China's gross domestic product, the investment bank said. Beijing, Guangzhou and Chongqing alone account for almost 9% of GDP.</p><p>With cases edging closer to the record recorded at the height of this year's monthslong lockdown of Shanghai, investors are wary of a repeat of the disruption to manufacturing, global trade and domestic economic growth that caused. Restaurant, retailer and Macau casino stocks listed in Hong Kong were among the top decliners on Monday, while liquor makers dragged on the Chinese onshore market. The Hang Seng Index fell 1.9%, while the Shanghai Composite Index declined 0.4%.</p><p>\"Beijing is facing the most complicated and severe situation of containing Covid since the coronavirus first emerged,\" Liu Xiaofeng, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said Monday. Beijing will require people arriving from other cities to test daily for three days on arrival, the Beijing government said.</p><p>Guangzhou on Monday said it would lock down for five days the district where China's third-largest airport is located.</p><p>Over the weekend, authorities in the city of 19 million people closed all entertainment venues and halted dine-in services in restaurants in the central business district, after already imposing stringent restrictions in other areas of the city.</p><p>The chaotic and rapidly evolving situation presents economic uncertainty that seems likely to further damp consumption and property sales in the near term, research firm Gavekal Dragonomics said in a note to clients last week.</p>",
