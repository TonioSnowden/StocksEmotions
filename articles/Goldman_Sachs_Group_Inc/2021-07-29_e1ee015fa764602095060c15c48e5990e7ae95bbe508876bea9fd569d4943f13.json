  "text": "<p>Last month, a special purpose acquisition company (Spac) called Athena used $415m to <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210707005442/en/Athena-Technology-Acquisition-Corp.-Announces-Business-Combination-with-Heliogen-Inc.-a-Leading-Provider-of-AI-Enabled-Concentrated-Solar-Energy-Combined-Company-Expected-to-Be-Listed-on-New-York-Stock-Exchange\">absorb a midsized California-based entity called Heliogen,</a> which produces solar plants controlled by artificial intelligence. </p> <p>Nothing remarkable about that, you might think; or not in today's overheated markets, where investment funds have recently flooded into AI, green energy, and Spacs. In the first seven months of 2021, an astonishing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea3872d0-a929-4b4d-9929-86480c7fccc7\">$180bn</a> was raised for Spacs, which collect pools of money to buy companies like Heliogen in private deals for subsequent listing, as an alternative to a traditional initial public offering. </p> <p>But one detail does make Athena stand out: it is led by two women — Isabelle Freidheim, a longtime venture capital investor, and Phyllis Newhouse, an army veteran and cyber security expert, who also happens to be black. That makes it “one of the only entirely women-led Spacs” — and Newhouse the “first woman of colour” taking a company public in this structure, or so trumpets Athena's marketing pitch. </p> <p>In recent months, some female celebrities — such as the tennis star Serena Williams — have been tapped to co-lead Spacs, adding marketing power. Women are also sitting on Spac boards. But, as Freidheim tells me, there is a striking paucity of&#xa0;women who&#xa0;are truly driving financial strategy or founding Spacs (aside from the rare exception of formidable Wall Street veteran Betsy Cohen.) </p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-04/in-record-breaking-year-spacs-avoid-gender-diversity-push\">analysis by Bloomberg</a> shows that even in terms of board seats, diversity trails the wider corporate world, probably because Spac structures are not scrutinised like public listings. Or, as the headhunter Spencer Stuart notes: “Many Spac sponsors find that they can efficiently formulate a board by leveraging existing personal networks . . . [which can] lead to reduced focus on securing racial, ethnic and gender diversity.” Privacy breeds clubbiness.</p> <p>So Friedheim and Newhouse want to fight back by creating their own club: they are tapping other women with senior corporate experience to work with their Spac, hoping these recruits will later raise their own funds. This is a Spac seeding campaign. As Friedheim says: “I want to be a queen-maker”, to counter the world of Wall Street kings. </p> <p>Should we applaud this? My initial instinct was mixed. That has less to do with gender issues, though, than the current state of Spacs. As innovations go, the structure certainly has a role to play in capital markets, since it offers a more flexible, speedy way for companies to raise capital than a rigid, costly IPO. This can be valuable for some companies, say fledgling tech groups.</p> <p>But history shows that whenever money is excessively cheap, good innovations tend to go bad because they are taken to crazy extremes. That happened 15 years ago with credit derivatives, as I once noted in a <a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Fools-Gold/Gillian-Tett/9781439100134\">book</a>. </p> <p>This is now playing out again with Spacs. The key reason for that $180bn boom is that the Federal Reserve has hitherto remained ultra-dovish, even though, as the economist Mohamed El-Erian observed in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elerianm/status/1419794448251195402\">tweet</a>, the Goldman Sachs financial conditions index is at record loose levels. </p> <p>If — or when — the cycle turns, follies and losses will appear. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea3872d0-a929-4b4d-9929-86480c7fccc7\">there are already hints</a> that some investors are getting nervous, not least because <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/what-you-need-know-about-spacs-investor-bulletin\">regulatory scrutiny</a> is rising. That makes it an odd moment to bring women and minorities into Spacs. </p> <p>Yet notwithstanding this caveat, there are three reasons why I applaud what Athena is trying to do. First, it draws attention to the wider, continuing, gender and racial disparity in finance. </p> <p>After all, one reason why there are fewer women or minorities driving Spacs is that you need to have senior dealmaking experience to attract investors, and fewer of this group have had the chance to get this.&#xa0;Rarity&#xa0;is a symptom of a bigger problem — not a cause.</p> <p>Second, Freidheim's move also highlights a crucial distinction in financial roles. Being a celebrity or Spac director is not the same as being a founder in economic terms. This matters, given that financial history also shows that whoever is involved in the early stages of any innovation cycle reaps outsized gains. The wealth in Spacs has overwhelmingly gone to white men. </p> <p>Third, achieving more diversity in Spacs — or any other financial innovation — could build a healthier system. That is not because I think there is anything magical about female or non-white brains that makes them wiser than men. </p> <p>The key point is that history also shows good ideas turn bad when tunnel vision and clubbiness rule supreme. Diverse perspectives, however, can reduce groupthink, offering checks and balances. Or, as Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/05/if-it-was-lehman-sisters-it-would-be-a-different-world-christine-lagarde\">has noted</a>, if “Lehman Brothers” had been “Lehman Sisters” during the 2008 crisis, it would have been “a different world” — with more checks and balances.</p> <p>This, in itself, does not guarantee that women- or minority-owned Spacs will outperform in any looming shakeout. I suspect they will, but there is no data, yet. But if more women and ethnic minorities engaged in the early stages of innovation and risk-taking, participating in the gains and losses, it would promote more lateral vision. We need this badly in finance, for the sake of women — and men. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gillian.tett@ft.com\"><em>gillian.tett@ft.com</em></a></p><p>Source: Gillian Tett  2021 'Women Spac founders are good for finance' FT.com 29 July.
