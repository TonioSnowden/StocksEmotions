  "title": "Why Was Daunte Wright Shot by the Police?",
  "text": "<p>Wright, Wyo.</p><p>---</p><p>It seems highly unlikely that officer Kim Potter intentionally killed Wright. Obey-or-die policing is the issue. Policing methods too often result in escalation and death for minor offenses, prompting accusations of racism. During arrests, police appear to have no tolerance for panic, bad judgment, mental illness, drug-induced behavior or simple mistakes. When an unarmed arrestee panics and runs, he should be recaught, not shot. Noncompliance during an arrest for a minor offense should never escalate to death.</p><p>William Goldman</p><p>Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.</p><p>---</p><p>The 26-year police veteran seemingly couldn't tell the difference between a Taser and a gun. That could be a rookie mistake but not one a seasoned officer would likely make. The guess here is that she panicked because a black man was taking off. His prior record and transgressions are irrelevant -- those are for the courts to deal with, not for a police officer, yet another one who killed a black man.</p><p>Steven Morris</p><p>Mt. Pleasant, S.C.</p><p>---</p><p>What was the trajectory of this tragedy? Wright had allegedly choked and threatened a woman with a firearm while trying to steal her rent money. When he was stopped on the road, a standard record check revealed the outstanding warrant and obligated police to place Wright under arrest. From there he vigorously resisted arrest, diving into his car, and in the heat of the moment, an officer made a tragic mistake.</p><p>Wright should be alive today. But let us not forget that his behavior set this series of events in motion, leaving death and destruction in its wake.</p><p>Stan VanTiem</p><p>Franklin, Tenn.</p>",
