  "title": "Patrick Drahi: the aggressive dealmaker forced to play the long game at BT",
  "text": "<p>Telecoms tycoon Patrick Drahi is renowned as an aggressive dealmaker. But as he stalks BT, the Franco-Israeli billionaire is treading softly as he circles a strategic asset in a country where he remains relatively unknown.</p> <p>On Tuesday Drahi's telecoms group Altice announced it had increased its stake in BT from 12 to 18 per cent, worth roughly £3bn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Altice, which is BT's biggest shareholder, declared that it would not make a takeover bid in the next six months unless there was an agreement with the board or a rival bid. Under the UK's strict takeover rules, that declaration is binding.*</p> <p>Meanwhile, Altice can continue to buy shares, either directly as long as it discloses each additional 0.5 per cent or indirectly through derivatives to avoid disclosure requirements.&#xa0;</p> <p>“This is a long-run mission for Drahi,” said a person familiar with the entrepreneur's thinking. “He has a lot of ideas but is not in a rush, so will keep his options open. But if he has invested this much in BT, it is because he finds the UK market and the company's project in fibre interesting from an industrial point of view.”</p> <p>Whether Drahi's move on BT is an effort to exercise creeping control as some at BT fear, or if it leads to a full bid for the group, one thing is clear: the UK government will have to decide to what extent it wants an outside entrepreneur to influence the former telecoms monopoly, which runs the country's economically important broadband network.&#xa0;</p> <p>While Drahi is well-known in the telecoms industry and in financial markets after years of debt-fuelled acquisitions in the US, France, Israel and Portugal, he is a relative stranger to Westminster. He and his advisers have met multiple government officials, including business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, and hired Ed Richards, the former head of regulator Ofcom, as an adviser on regulatory and political issues, said people familiar with the matter. </p> <p>But the government put the billionaire on notice with its first public statement, declaring that it would “not hesitate to act if required to protect our critical national telecoms infrastructure”. It also noted the new National Security &amp; Investment Act that takes effect in January could be used to block a takeover of BT.</p> <p>Drahi kicked off his charm offensive with BT's top executives about two months ago at a dinner in London at Goldman Sachs, one of the UK company's advisers. The heads of BT's main divisions gave presentations of non-confidential information and met the billionaire's team, including Dennis Okhuijsen, a long term lieutenant, and his son Nathan Drahi, who holds a senior position at Sotheby's, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1db9d5c6-9101-11e9-aea1-2b1d33ac3271\">auction house</a> his father bought in 2019.</p> <p>Born in Morocco and educated at France's top engineering school, Ecole Polytechnique, Drahi has built his fortune largely on bets on cable: his first success was with an operator he founded in the south of France, going door to door to sell subscriptions and lobbying mayors to convince them to let him dig up their streets to install lines.</p> <p>Eventually Drahi sold his company to UPC, a US group owned by his idol, the billionaire “Cable Cowboy” John Malone. He kept doing deals, with the most active period from 2012 to 2016 when he splashed out more than €50bn to buy SFR, France's then second-biggest telco, the former monopoly Portugal Telecom, and two US cable operators Cablevision and Suddenlink.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Benefiting from historically low interest rates and easy access to debt, Drahi has used a similar playbook to acquire what he sees as undervalued telecoms assets and then aggressively cuts costs on everything from staff to overheads to repay debt and boost profits. In some countries, he has sold off or spun out infrastructure such as towers or fibre networks to raise funds. Some analysts criticise this as asset stripping but others celebrate it as savvy financial engineering.</p> <p>At BT he is taking a different tack by building the stake gradually and presenting himself as a friendly long-term backer. “We have engaged constructively with the board and management of BT and . . . continue to hold them in high regard and remain fully supportive of their strategy,” especially on the rollout of a nationwide fibre broadband network, he said in a statement.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Drahi is attracted by BT's low valuation compared with the implicit worth of Openreach, the company's network division. Openreach was slow to begin the upgrade to fibre as its parent company invested instead in sports broadcasting and mobile; it is well-placed to dominate the UK fibre market but the benefits of that investment have yet to be reaped, a point not lost on Drahi, according to people familiar with the situation.</p> <p>BT appears to be Drahi's next big play after the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5db956c4-73fa-4b2b-bea9-e244bf4ce441\">delisting</a> of Altice Europe last year and the failure to land more acquisitions in the US. An offer to acquire Canada's Cogeco was rejected in 2020, and more recently Altice was also rebuffed after bidding for Eutelsat, the French satellite operator.</p> <p>Drahi has little choice but to play a long game, given the complexity of the situation and size of the target, which is valued at about £17bn, not including debt and its huge pension liabilities, said one telecoms investor. “I don't think buying the whole thing would really work since BT would be a big ticket for him and the government would not likely allow it,” said the investor. “He could take a more activist route by pushing to break the company up and then buying pieces of it.”</p> <p>Analysts have long speculated that BT could unlock value by hiving off Openreach, or splitting off its consumer-facing business instead. Private equity firms such as KKR have also <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10984245-b533-4fe6-aea3-8604b26b9f0c\">studied</a> such scenarios, although splitting those businesses would be complex from a regulatory and operational perspective.</p> <p>Deutsche Telekom <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ac4c28e-1e45-11e9-b2f7-97e4dbd3580d\">remains</a> a 12 per cent stakeholder in BT and, having written down the value of the stake by more than €3bn and abandoning plans to buy the business itself, now sees itself as a kingmaker. Tim Höttges, chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, said in November that it would keep “all options open”.&#xa0;</p> <p>With BT committed to a rapid £15bn upgrade of its network so that fibre reaches 25m homes and businesses by 2026, Altice would probably need to convince ministers that it could improve on that aggressive plan in order to receive their blessing for a takeover.</p> <p>One senior telecoms executive noted that convincing BT was less important than winning over the government. “He has to swing sentiment in his favour or partner with someone who can,” the person said.&#xa0;</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Dan Thomas</em></p> <p>*<em>This article has been updated to clarify that Altice was not forced to make its declaration</em><br><br></p><p>Source: Leila Abboud in Paris, Nic Fildes and Arash Massoudi in London 2021 'Patrick Drahi: the aggressive dealmaker forced to play the long game at BT' FT.com 15 December.
