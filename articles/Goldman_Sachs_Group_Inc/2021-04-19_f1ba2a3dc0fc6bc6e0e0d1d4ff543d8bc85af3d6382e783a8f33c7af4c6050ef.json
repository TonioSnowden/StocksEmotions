  "text": "<p>Meituan, one of China's largest internet companies, plans to raise about $10bn in an equity and debt deal delayed by a misfire that sent its shares tumbling last week.</p> <p>The food delivery giant, which is backed by technology group Tencent, will raise about $7bn in equity and sell $3bn in convertible bonds.</p> <p>The company will use the funds to develop autonomous delivery vehicles as it expands into areas such as groceries and ride-hailing, reflecting rapid consumer spending growth in China following a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e45496ec-82ff-4586-a062-20124739fcc1\">strong recovery</a> from the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>It is one of the largest capital raisings by a Chinese technology business this year. In February, Alibaba, Jack Ma's ecommerce platform, brought in $5bn from a bond sale. The deals come even as Beijing has launched a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd3834b5-a3f3-40e5-82db-7552ef35640e\">far-reaching clampdown</a> on monopolistic practices in China's tech sector that has damped stock prices.</p> <p>Meituan put the placement on hold last week after 300m of its shares, worth about $11bn — approximately 6 per cent of its equity — were moved into a Hong Kong stock exchange clearing account belonging to Goldman Sachs, according to two people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>The people said the change, which is disclosed publicly and monitored by hedge funds, gave traders an early warning of the upcoming placement of Meituan shares that led to a 7.4 per cent drop in their price last Tuesday. </p> <p>The company's Hong Kong-listed stock has yet to recover fully and as of Monday's close was still down 3 per cent from its level before last week's fall. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the shares appearing in the bank's clearing account last week. Meituan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>After the market closed on Monday, Meituan said it plans to raise up to $6.6bn from a placement of 187m shares sold at HK$265-HK$274 each, and raise another $400m through a private placement to Tencent, already one of the group's largest investors, according to terms seen by the Financial Times. </p> <p>The company's share price has slumped 37 per cent from a peak this year. Meituan is one of several technology giants used by analysts as a bellwether for the impact of China's regulatory controls over the sector.</p> <p>Last week, Beijing fined Alibaba $2.8bn after a four-month investigation into the company's market practices. Meituan was one of about 30 tech groups that pledged to comply with China's antitrust laws after a warning from Beijing on companies to follow enhanced regulations.</p><p>Source: Tabby Kinder and Hudson Lockett in Hong Kong 2021 'Meituan to raise $10bn in delayed deal after share price drop' FT.com 19 April.
