  "title": "Dow Jumps More Than 800 Points as Fears of Interest-Rate Hikes Subside; S&P 500, Nasdaq also rally, finish week with gains of more than 6%",
  "text": "<p>Indexes have bounced back after the S&amp;P 500 last week tumbled into a bear market, defined as a 20% drop from a recent high. The broad market index finished the week up 6.4%, though it is still down about 18% from its last record close in January.</p><p>The Dow industrials gained 5.4% for the week, while the Nasdaq rallied 7.5%. All three indexes recouped their losses from the previous week.</p><p>Stocks tumbled earlier this month on concerns that the Fed could push the economy into a recession as it tightens monetary policy to combat inflation. Market indexes rebounded this week after bargain-hunters swooped in to buy cheap stocks and—in a paradoxical twist where bad news was good news—some worse-than-expected economic figures fueled investors' hopes that the Fed might become less hawkish.</p><p>\"It's clear that economic activity is cooling, which should cool down inflation. That together is rather positive,\" said Luc Filip, head of investments at SYZ Private Banking.</p><p>The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment dropped in June to its lowest-ever recorded level, according to survey data released on Friday. The drop highlighted the grim mood among Americans as inflation eats into their purchasing power and recession fears loom.</p><p>The university also revised its May reading of inflation expectations over the next five to 10 years, lowering them to 3.1% from 3.3%. The revision fueled some optimism that the Fed wouldn't be as aggressive about hiking interest rates, analysts said, and added to market gains after the survey's release at 10 a.m. ET. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell had cited the survey's May reading for long-term inflation expectations in explaining last week's 0.75 percentage point rate increase.</p><p>Earlier, the U.S. composite purchasing managers index, which measures activity in manufacturing and services, fell to a five-month low on Thursday.</p><p>Data from interest-rate derivatives markets suggests that traders think the Fed could be cutting rates by the second half of next year. \"Growth is coming down, maybe even sooner than expected. That should allow the Fed to soften at some point,\" said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank.</p><p>Matt Stucky, senior portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, warned that this week's rebound doesn't mean the market has hit bottom. The Fed will need more evidence that it is winning the fight against inflation before it steps back from raising interest rates, he said.</p><p>\"Financial conditions are going to continue to be tighter rather than looser, in my opinion,\" Mr. Stucky said. \"Even with a couple of encouraging data points this week, it's not going to be enough for the Fed to say, 'OK, we're going to back off and see what happens next.'\"</p><p>All 11 sectors of the S&amp;P 500 ended Friday in positive territory, with materials, financials, technology and consumer-discretionary stocks among the strongest performers. Bank stocks got a boost from the Fed's annual stress tests, released late Thursday, which gave the country's biggest lenders a clean bill of health. Shares of Wells Fargo rose $2.86, or 7.5%, to $40.76 on Friday, while Goldman Sachs added $16.58 per share, or 5.8%, to $302.75.</p><p>Among other stocks, software firm Zendesk surged $16.22 a share, or 28%, to $74.17 after it said it would be acquired by a group of investors including Permira and Helman &amp; Friedman for $10.2 billion. FedEx shares rallied $16.26, or 7.2%, to $243.24 after reporting a rise in revenue driven by higher shipping rates and fuel surcharges.</p><p>Carnival shares jumped $1.20, or 12%, to $10.85 after the cruise-line operator reported it was on track for a nearly 50% increase in quarterly revenue compared with the first three months of the year. Its competitors also rallied, with Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and Royal Caribbean both posting double-digit gains.</p><p>Shares of LendingTree tumbled $4.32, or 7.9%, to $50.55 after the online financial marketplace lowered its earnings outlook for the current quarter, saying that rising interest rates had weakened demand for home loans.</p><p>The close of trading saw heavy volumes Friday as index provider FTSE Russell rebalanced its stock benchmarks, an annual event in which it adds and removes companies from indexes tied to trillions of dollars of investments. The managers of passive funds tied to those indexes generally buy or sell those stocks around 4 p.m. ET on the day of the so-called Russell rebalance, to ensure their funds track their benchmarks accurately.</p><p>Nasdaq said a record 3.3 billion shares, worth $63.8 billion, changed hands in the closing auction that sets official end-of-day prices for Nasdaq-listed stocks. The New York Stock Exchange said it had the fourth-largest close in NYSE history, as its closing-auction volume hit 2.3 billion shares worth $79.3 billion.</p><p>Oil prices climbed, with futures on benchmark Brent crude rising 2.8% to settle at $113.12 a barrel. Still, they are down nearly 8% this month.</p><p>The recent decline in commodity prices is an encouraging signal, said Ms. Dwek, of FlowBank. \"That's exactly what the Fed would want to see, since commodities are part of the reason why inflation is so high,\" she said.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note climbed to 3.125% from 3.068% on Thursday. Bond yields rise when prices fall.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 added 2.6%, its largest daily gain in more than three months. In Asia, most major benchmarks ended the week higher. The Shanghai Composite Index on Friday rose 0.9% and Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 1.2%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rallied 2.1%.</p><p>Cryptocurrencies were steady, with bitcoin climbing to above $21,000. It had fallen below $18,000 last weekend but has since staged a modest recovery.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com and Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@wsj.com</p><p>Dow Jumps More Than 800 Points as Fears of Interest-Rate Hikes Subside</p>",
