  "title": "Fed Searches for the Magic Number to Cool a Red-Hot U.S. Housing Market; The central bank must decide on an interest rate that will cap sky-high price growth without triggering a painful economic slowdown",
  "text": "<p>With a nudge from the Fed's recent interest rate increases, mortgage rates have risen almost 2.3 percentage points since November to 5.25% last week, the steepest rise in a six-month-span in decades. In the past, that kind of increase was usually enough for home buying and construction to fall sharply. Yet home prices could still hit new highs, even with sales starting to fall. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate housing prices will grow around 10% this year; Bank of America forecast 15%.</p><p>\"This is a market as resistant to higher interest rates as you could possibly imagine,\" said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner at Beacon Economics in Los Angeles. \"This is not a market that 5% interest rates are going to scare at all.\"</p><p>That leaves the Fed to decide how far and how fast rates need to go up to make a dent in the housing market without triggering a painful economic slowdown. Housing has been a traditional battleground in the fight against inflation because it is sensitive to interest rates and makes up a significant part of the U.S. economy. For nearly a decade, mortgage rates below 5% gave buyers the leeway to purchase more expensive homes. Rising rates weaken that purchasing power.</p><p>How high rates should go will be debated among central bank policy makers in the months ahead. \"There's not a bright line drawn on the road that tells us when we get there,\" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said. The Fed has signaled plans to raise its benchmark rate, currently in a range between 0.75% and 1%, by a half percentage point next month and again in July.</p><p>Core inflation, which excludes often volatile food and energy prices, rose 5.2% in March from a year earlier using the Fed's preferred gauge, the personal-consumption expenditures price index. The central bank is raising rates to cool down the economy and bring supply and demand back into balance.</p><p>\"What we need to see is inflation coming down in a clear and convincing way, and we're going to keep pushing until we see that,\" Mr. Powell said in an interview last week.</p><p>Economists and those in the real-estate industry have explanations for the unrelenting demand and minimal supply accelerating housing prices nationwide: millions of Americans in their 20s and 30s reaching peak home-buying years, more work-from-home jobs in the pandemic, increased competition from investors and too little housing built in the past decade.</p><p>Homeowners also have an incentive to stay put. Many don't see where they can afford to move. In April, the monthly mortgage payment on the typical home jumped to $1,475, assuming a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 20% down payment, according to Zillow Group Inc. That is up 34% since December and 53% from April 2021.</p><p>High prices have already lifted homes out of the reach of some buyers. The median existing-home sale price rose 14.8% in April from a year earlier to $391,200, the National Association of Realtors said.</p><p>\"At some point it becomes too onerous, and we're probably close to that point,\" said Sam Khater, chief economist at Freddie Mac.</p><p>Early signs of a potential cooling have surfaced. Sales of new homes dropped 16.6% in April from March, at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, to the lowest level since April 2020, when the pandemic brought commerce to a standstill, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Existing-home sales fell for the third straight month in April to the lowest seasonally adjusted annual rate since June 2020, NAR said.</p><p>Housing supply is stabilizing and purchases are slowing in some metropolitan areas. At the end of April, the number of homes for sale in Las Vegas without an offer was up 34% compared with the same time last year, according to a local real-estate group. Home sales fell 15% over the same period. In the week ended May 14, the number of homes for sale nationwide rose 5% from a year earlier, the biggest year-over-year gain since 2019, according to Realtor.com. News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com.</p><p>Real-estate brokerage Redfin Corp.'s seasonally adjusted measure of home buying demand, which tracks buyer inquiries, fell 8% in the week ended May 15 compared with a year earlier, the biggest drop since April 2020. About 18% of sellers cut their asking prices in the four weeks ended May 15, compared with 9.5% of sellers in the same period a year ago.</p><p>Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, expects sales to shrink in the second half of the year. The pullback, he said, will allow the Fed to dial back its current pace of rate increases.</p><p>Economists agree there is an interest rate that will significantly throttle housing demand, but no one knows exactly what that rate is. Analysts at Credit Suisse said 30-year mortgage rates would need to reach 5.5% and stay there.</p><p>Taylor Morrison Home Corp., a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based home builder, offered one reason to think rates might have to go higher. The company reported last month that the majority of homeowners who got conventional mortgages in the first quarter from the builder's mortgage lender could have qualified for a loan at significantly higher rates.</p><p>The company, which expects to complete more than 14,000 homes this year with an average price of $625,000, found that fewer than 10% of 1,500 prospective buyers surveyed this year said they would stop their home search because of rising mortgage rates. Shoppers in a 2018 survey, the last time mortgage rates rose to 5%, were twice as likely to say they would pull back.</p><p>\"We wanted a house no matter what,\" said Kendal Strong, a 31-year-old hairstylist. She and Jon Williams bought a three-bedroom home in Springdale, Ark., in April for $322,500. Ms. Strong said rising rates weren't going to keep the couple from their next step in life, owning a home together. </p><p>Kendal Strong and Jon Williams inside of their newly purchased three-bedroom house.

In 2022, the share \"will be larger still,\" he said. \"With housing costs gaining an ever-larger weight in the inflation Americans experience, I will be looking even more closely at real estate to judge the appropriate stance of monetary policy.\"</p><p>Real-estate professionals said employer permission for many white-collar employees to work remotely has allowed buyers to seek housing in more distant, less expensive locales. That helped lift demand for housing—and prices—in more affordable cities and towns.</p><p>\"If you think you're going to cut home-buying demand, just instantly, by raising rates, that works so much better when someone was looking in San Francisco and had to stay there,\" said Glenn Kelman, chief executive at Redfin. \"But when mortgage rates go from 3% to 4% to 5%, people can just go from San Francisco to Ohio, to Arkansas, to Louisiana.\"</p><p>Real-estate investors, often all-cash buyers, also compete for limited housing stock, buying and renting out single-family dwellings as a high-yield asset insulated from inflation. Corporate and individual investors accounted for 21% of home purchases in December, up from 17% a year earlier, according to CoreLogic.</p><p>Many in the real-estate industry say they fear that mortgage rates at 6% or higher would significantly chill the housing market, softening prices and causing sales to take a harder tumble.</p><p>Several analysts say the current period may echo the late 1970s and early 1980s, when high inflation prompted the Fed to ratchet up interest rates. Sales of newly built homes plunged, and nominal home-price growth slowed but didn't decline. The broader economy fell into a double-dip recession that sent unemployment soaring.</p><p>By contrast, the last time the Fed raised rates in a sustained fashion, between 2004 and 2006, tighter money initially did little to slow housing because lenders drastically eased their standards to welcome more buyers, inflating a housing bubble that burst in 2007.</p><p>Mr. Waller, the Fed governor, said he doesn't see such housing-market trouble ahead. \"The demand is permanently there,\" he said. \"The supply hasn't caught up.\"</p><p>Short supply</p><p>Home builders have increased production but are hamstrung by volatile material costs, supply-chain troubles and shortages of skilled tradespeople and available land. \"The Fed is determined to put out this fire,\" Douglas Bauer, chief executive at Nevada-based home builder Tri Pointe Homes Inc., told analysts last month. \"But there is just no supply.\"</p><p>For the decade following the 2007-2009 recession, new-home construction in the U.S. slowed. The homeowner vacancy rate has since fallen to 0.8%, the lowest in 66 years of record-keeping. The rental vacancy rate is near its lowest level since 1984. At the end of April, 1.03 million homes were listed for sale nationally, equal to a 2.2-month supply at the current sales pace, compared with a historical average of 5.7 months for that time of year, according to NAR.</p><p>About 1.64 million single-family and multifamily homes were under construction in April on a seasonally adjusted basis, the highest level in data going back to 1970, according to census data. Many are likely to be completed by the end of the year. Mr. Bauer, the home builder, points out that many of those single-family homes are already sold, which means they won't fix the current supply shortage.</p><p>John Burns Real Estate Consulting calculates the U.S. is short around 1.7 million housing units given population growth and household formation. Mr. Khater, the Freddie Mac economist, estimated that the U.S. needed 3.8 million dwelling units as of late 2020.</p><p>Homeowners who refinanced their mortgages at ultralow rates have less incentive to sell, also crimping supply. Almost 98% of outstanding 30-year conventional mortgages have a rate below 5%, according to Freddie Mac.</p><p>One indicator of market balance—the difference between the financial advantage of home buying versus renting—is starting to move against buying. At the end of last year, the ratio of U.S. home prices to rents reached its highest since 2007, according to the Dallas Fed.</p><p>Mr. Waller, the Fed governor, and his wife, frustrated in their search, finally threw in the towel. Last month, they signed an apartment lease.</p><p>Write to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com and Nicole Friedman at nicole.friedman@wsj.com</p><p>Fed Searches for the Magic Number to Cool a Red-Hot U.S. Housing Market</p>",
