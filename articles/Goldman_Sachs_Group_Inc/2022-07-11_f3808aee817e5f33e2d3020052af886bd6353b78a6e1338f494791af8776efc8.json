  "text": "<p>The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, has gained 10% so far in 2022. And with the Federal Reserve determined to continue tightening rates in the face of stubborn inflation and rising odds of a global recession, investors are likely to cling to the dollar for a long time. The best most Asian central banks can hope for is orderly depreciation.</p><p>India is under particular pressure as a large commodity importer but has also been taking active steps to curb the scale of capital outflows—including some market-friendly changes. Last week, the Reserve Bank of India relaxed debt-market rules for foreign portfolio investors and allowed commercial banks to raise interest rates on nonresidents' foreign-currency deposits. India's foreign-exchange reserves are still ample at $588.31 billion as of July 1, but they have fallen by over $45 billion in the past half year. The Indian rupee is down about 6.6% since the beginning of 2022, according to FactSet, testing a series of record lows in the past few weeks.</p><p>Currencies of neighboring emerging economies such as Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia have also been routed in the past several weeks. The Indonesian rupiah is down 4.4% since the beginning of April, while the Thai baht is down 8% and Malaysia's ringgit is down 5.5%. Their foreign-exchange reserves have also taken a hit, with Thailand being the worst affected. Its reserves have fallen by nearly a 10th during the past six months. Thailand's central bank has nonetheless been willing to tolerate a big depreciation given the risk that sharp rate rises would pose to a still-weak economy: With most pandemic restrictions now removed for vaccinated travelers, it is pegging its hopes on a strong rebound for its tourist sector. Before the pandemic, around 20% of Thailand's economy was tied to tourism.</p><p>Indonesia's currency has performed better than its peers mainly because of strong commodity exports. Following a brief export ban in early 2022, the nation's coal exports have surged—exports of coal and lignite in May were valued at about $5 billion, according to data from CEIC, more than double the same month in 2019. That has given Indonesia's central bank a bit more wiggle room: It has vowed to keep an eye on the weakening currency but resisted raising interest rates so far. Goldman Sachs expects Bank Indonesia to kick-start its tightening cycle in August, delivering a cumulative 1.25 percentage points of rate rises this year.</p><p>Asian central banks are walking a narrow path between rates, inflation and capital outflows—with a fair amount of improvisation and hope in the policy mix too. Whatever they do, a real respite awaits an end to the Fed tightening cycle. For now at least, the dollar remains unassailable.</p><p>Write to Megha Mandavia at megha.mandavia@wsj.com</p><p>Asian Central Banks Fight an Unwinnable Battle Against the Dollar</p>",
