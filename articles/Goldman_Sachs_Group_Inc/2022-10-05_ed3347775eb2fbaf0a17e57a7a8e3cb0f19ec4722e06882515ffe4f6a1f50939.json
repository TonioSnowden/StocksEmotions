  "title": "OPEC+ Brinkmanship Could Backfire; The oil cartel's rationale for the production cut isn't as important as how oil consumers interpret the move",
  "text": "<p>The decision is notable not only because oil prices are still high relative to historic levels but also because oil-market conditions remain very tight. Industry oil stockpiles in countries that make up the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development are 9.2% lower than the five-year average, according to the International Energy Agency's September report. While the oil cartel has often cut production in the face of weakening demand, it has never implemented a cut in such a tight market, according to a Goldman Sachs research note from Monday.</p><p>OPEC+'s rationale for the production cut will vary depending on who is answering the question. Theories have ranged from political foul play—that the group is acting as a conduit for Russia to inflict pain on the West—to the group's own stated rationale, which involves innocuous concerns that a recession might cause oil demand to fall. Of course, besides the demand-side uncertainty, the big supply-side wild card is Russia. The European Union's import ban on Russian oil goes into effect in just two months' time, and it is anyone's guess how the Kremlin will respond to the Group of Seven nation's proposed price cap on its oil exports.</p><p>What matters more isn't OPEC+'s actual intention, but that the West will interpret the move as an affront. The White House, for example, has responded with a statement saying that President Biden is \"disappointed by the shortsighted decision by OPEC+ to cut production quotas while the global economy is dealing with the continued negative impacts of Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\"</p><p>In the near term, power tilts in the favor of OPEC+ because the West doesn't have effective countermeasures at their disposal. The U.S. is nearing the end of its historic release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and while the White House has left the door open for more such releases, further large draws would be risky given historically depleted levels. As Dan Pickering, chief investment officer of Pickering Energy Partners, remarked in a tweet: OPEC can cut more oil and for longer than the Biden administration can release from the SPR.</p><p>Offending the West in this way could backfire, of course. The White House also said on Wednesday that OPEC+'s announcement is a \"reminder\" of why it is so important to wean off foreign fossil fuels, and reiterated its commitment to a clean-energy transition. That is the balancing act OPEC+ must perform going forward: Maximize oil revenue today, and the West will find ways to pivot more quickly away from oil. The 1973 oil embargo was a strong catalyst behind improving fuel-efficiency standards in the U.S., after all.</p><p>It is a winning game for OPEC+ in the short term, but playing too aggressively is also a surefire way to lose in the long run.</p><p>Jinjoo Lee</p><p>Write to Jinjoo Lee at jinjoo.lee@wsj.com</p><p>OPEC+ Brinkmanship Could Backfire</p>",
