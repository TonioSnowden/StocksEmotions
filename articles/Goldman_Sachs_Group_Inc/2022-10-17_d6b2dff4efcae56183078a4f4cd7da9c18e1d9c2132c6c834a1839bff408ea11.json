  "text": "<p>Japan's prime minister Fumio Kishida is seizing on an expected surge in spending by international tourists following the lifting of Covid-19 travel curb as an opportunity to emphasise the upsides of a sinking yen.</p> <p>Economists have estimated annual foreign tourist spending could exceed the government's annual target of ¥5tn ($35bn), a level that would help offset the higher costs of imported food and energy that have widened Japan's trade deficit. </p> <p>“We need to prepare various measures to maximise the benefits of the weak yen by promoting inbound tourism, reshoring of companies and exports,” Kishida said in an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e1525dc4-39f4-48f0-b8bb-fc462fe06676\">interview with the Financial Times</a> last week.</p> <p>Changing the gloomy economic narrative surrounding the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/yen\">yen</a>'s decline is crucial for Kishida, whose popularity has fallen to an all-time low. A recent poll by Jiji showed a 4.9 percentage point drop in support to 27.4 per cent.</p> <p>Japan lifted almost all remaining coronavirus travel restrictions on October 11, scrapping visa requirements for individual tourists and an entry cap of 50,000 foreign visitors per day. </p> <p>Visitors are now exempt from quarantine and Covid-19 tests on arrival, although they still have to submit either a certificate of vaccination or a negative test result from within 72 hours of their departure.</p> <p>Ahead of the ending of restrictions, Kishida went on a whirlwind tour that included celebrating the return of Formula One motor racing to the Suzuka Circuit in central Japan and promoting Wagyu beef in the south-western prefecture of Kagoshima.</p> <p>Making one of his first public appearances without wearing a face mask, the prime minister's message was clear: after nearly three years, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/japan\">Japan</a> was finally ready to reopen to the world. </p> <p>The government ¥5tn target for annual tourist spending is slightly higher than the level achieved in 2019 when a record 31.8mn international travellers visited Japan.</p> <p>Yuriko Tanaka, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said inbound consumption could reach an annual ¥6.6tn if Chinese tourists returned to Japan, as she expects in the second quarter of 2023 at the earliest. Such a return would require a big shift in the Chinese government's strict zero-Covid approach, which includes tight curbs on outward travel. China accounted for about a third of Japan's foreign visitors in 2019.</p> <p>When overseas spending by Japanese citizens travelling abroad was taken into account, the net gain from international travel would be about ¥4.3tn, Tanaka said.</p> <p>“This amount is not large enough to fully offset Japan's large goods trade deficit, but it is more than enough to offset the ¥1tn current account deficit that we predict for 2023,” she said. </p> <p>Rino Onodera from Mizuho Research &amp; Technologies said Kishida's ¥5tn inbound spending target would be “quite ambitious” without Chinese tourists. But she added the weak yen had already pushed up per-capita spending. “Inflation, as well as<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/808738dc-b8ea-4da5-b41f-9570c35c36a4\"> ‘revenge' consumption</a> by long-awaited tourists, is expected to boost spending,” Onodera said. </p> <p>Before this month's full reopening, Japan's policy on international visitors had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0307cf87-5500-4fd8-80c5-b94e75df6688\">caused confusion and turmoil</a> in the travel industry. A partial easing of restrictions in June required individual tourists to be escorted by a guide “from entry to departure”.</p> <p>Economists said increasing inbound spending was vital while Japan's underlying domestic demand remained weak. </p> <p>The country posted a monthly trade deficit of more than ¥2.49tn in August. The cost of imported goods has been further inflated by the yen's fall to a 32-year low of ¥148.86 against the US dollaron Friday.</p> <p>But Fumiko Kato, chief executive of WAmazing, a company that provides services to foreign tourists in Japan, said there could be a downside to the arrival of tourists with newly increased purchasing power.</p> <p>Visitor spending could raise prices in popular tourist areas, putting pressure on the local population, Kato warned. “Locals may feel they are oppressed by foreign tourists.”</p><p>Source: Eri Sugiura in Tokyo 2022 'Japan hopes surge in foreign tourist spending will offer upside to weak yen' FT.com 17 October.
