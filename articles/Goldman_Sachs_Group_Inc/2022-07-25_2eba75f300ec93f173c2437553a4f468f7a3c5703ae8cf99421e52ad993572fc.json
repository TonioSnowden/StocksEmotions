  "text": "<p>A former Goldman Sachs banker was accused by US authorities of passing sensitive market information to his squash partner, in one of a series of insider trading cases announced by federal prosecutors in Manhattan on Monday.</p> <p>New York-based Brijesh Goel, 37, was one of nine defendants charged in four unrelated alleged schemes. Regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission have also filed related civil cases. </p> <p>According to the SEC's complaint, Goel was accused of trading on material non-public information gleaned from his job at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/980562d6-2db0-4b25-a349-b83d4b86bea7\">Goldman</a>, where he worked from 2013 until 2021.</p> <p>The SEC said the alleged scheme started in 2017 and netted Goel and Akshay Niranjan, a 33-year-old trader at Barclays in New York, $291,735 in profits. The two were friends from graduate school and played squash together, the SEC said. </p> <p>Authorities alleged that Niranjan used information shared with him by Goel to trade in shares of companies including Lumos Networks, PharMerica Corporation and Calgon Carbon using call options — a bet that the price of the underlying security will rise.</p> <p>In a statement, Goldman said the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/59e302ae-6e5c-4db7-85af-42be5bed9bac\">insider trading</a> alleged by the government “is egregious and illegal conduct”.</p> <p>“The firm condemns such behaviour, which violates our standards of conduct and business principles. We are fully co-operating with the SEC and DoJ,” Goldman said.</p> <p>Goel joined Apollo Global Management from Goldman last year as principal on the firm's structured finance team. Apollo learned of the allegation on Monday and placed him on indefinite leave, a company spokesperson said.</p> <p>Reed Brodsky, a lawyer for Goel, said in a statement: “Sadly, the government rushed to charge Brijesh on the apparent say-so of one person about something that supposedly happened years ago before Brijesh's current job — without giving Brijesh the chance to speak with them, unfairly tarring his name . . . Brijesh looks forward to demonstrating his innocence.”</p> <p>A lawyer for Niranjan, who was named in the SEC's civil complaint but not the DoJ's criminal case, and Barclays declined to comment. </p> <p>Prosecutors also brought charges on Monday against Stephen Buyer, an ex-congressman who allegedly traded on information picked up at a golf outing. &#xa0;Buyer, 63, served as a congressman from Indiana from 1993 to 2011. After leaving Congress, he set up Steve Buyer Group, a consulting firm whose clients included T-Mobile.</p> <p>In a parallel civil case, the SEC said that Buyer learned about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/80b3088c-5424-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1\">T-Mobile's plan to acquire rival Sprint</a> while at a golf outing in March 2018 with a T-Mobile executive. The next day, the SEC said, Buyer began purchasing Sprint securities. When news of the merger broke, Buyer netted more than $107,000 in profits, the SEC alleged.</p> <p>In 2019, according to the SEC's complaint, Buyer purchased more than $1mn worth of stock in Navigant Consulting ahead of a public announcement that it would be acquired by Guidehouse, which was one of Buyer's clients.</p> <p>Andrew Goldstein, a partner at Cooley and Buyer's lawyer, said his client was innocent.</p> <p>“His stock trades were lawful. He looks forward to being quickly vindicated,” Goldstein said in a statement.</p><p>Source: Joshua Franklin and Antoine Gara in New York 2022 'Former Goldman banker accused of passing inside tips to squash partner' FT.com 25 July.
