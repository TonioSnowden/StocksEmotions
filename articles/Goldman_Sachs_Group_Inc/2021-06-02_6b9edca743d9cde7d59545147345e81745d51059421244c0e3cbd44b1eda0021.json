  "text": "<p>Bloomsbury Publishing set a special dividend and raised guidance again after delivering forecast beating full-year results. </p> <p>For the year ended February pre-tax profit grew 31 per cent to £17.3m on revenues up 14 per cent to £185.1m. The publisher declared a special dividend of 9.78p per share in addition to the final dividend of 7.58p, up 10 per cent year on year. </p> <p>“Considering the ongoing momentum and strength of our business, Bloomsbury expects revenue to be ahead and profit to be comfortably ahead of market expectations” for the current fiscal year, said Nigel Newton, chief executive.</p> <p>Bloomsbury shares closed at 309p on Tuesday for a 41 per cent gain over the past year, which gives the London-based company a market value of nearly £260m.</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p>Construction materials distributor <strong>Brickability</strong> said it had agreed to buy Taylor Maxwell, a timber and cladding supplier, for up to £63m. It said the deal will be “significantly earnings accretive” and should help diversify its product offering. To help fund the deal Brickability raised £55m with a share placing to institutional investors. The new shares were placed at 95p, an 8.2&#xa0;per cent discount to Tuesday's close, and were accompanied by £38m of sales by existing investors “in order to meet market demand”. </p> <p><strong>Wizz Air</strong> posted a €576m loss for the year ended March as revenue slumped 73 per cent to €739m. The budget airline reported total cash at the end of March of €1.6bn and a quarterly cash burn of €84m during the last quarter. Wizz said it expects to fly around 30 per cent of its capacity in the first quarter and flagged that it will remain lossmaking in the current year unless pandemic restrictions are permanently lifted, with normality returning in the fiscal year ending 2023. </p> <p>Traffic figures from <strong>Ryanair</strong> showed the airline carrying 1.8m passengers in May, up from 1m the month before. Ryanair said it had operated over 12,000 flights in May with a 79 per cent load factor, the percentage of available seating capacity that is occupied.</p> <p><strong>Hargreaves Services</strong>, the outsourcer for the industrial and property sectors, said results for the year ended May will be in line with expectations. It cited a “very strong performance” of its German joint venture and the early completion of a <a href=\"https://www.business-live.co.uk/commercial-property/hargreaves-waystone-land-25m-unity-20465192\">land sale</a> in Doncaster.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Credit Suisse</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f127ca3e-ba55-4af5-b172-2ee48ed0dffb\">preparing for litigation</a> against <strong>SoftBank</strong> after the collapse of Greensill Capital soured the relationship between the Swiss bank and one of the world's largest tech investors, according to people briefed on the plans. The threat of a lawsuit comes as Credit Suisse clients press the bank to&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/451aa60d-b35e-4a72-837d-acf8b57ece4c\">compensate them for losses</a>. Several class action lawsuits bringing together dozens of wealthy investors in the funds are gathering pace.</p> <p>Leon Black, the former chief executive of <strong>Apollo Global Management</strong>, has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72244917-3208-43ab-b076-513c9fc058ee\">hit with a lawsuit</a> claiming that he raped and harassed a young Russian model before manipulating her with promises of money and sham job interviews at Goldman Sachs. The claims, which come weeks after Black&#xa0;stepped down&#xa0;from Apollo following scrutiny of his ties to the late paedophile&#xa0;Jeffrey Epstein,&#xa0;contradict Black's account of what he has characterised as a “consensual affair” with a woman who he claims later extorted him.</p> <p>The US <strong>Securities and Exchange Commission</strong> on Tuesday said it will not enforce Trump-era rules for shareholder advisory firms, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd962367-b92c-4f37-9355-47f35aaf573d\">dealing a blow</a> to companies such as ExxonMobil that have argued proxy advisers wield too much power. In a statement, commission chair Gary Gensler&#xa0;said&#xa0;he has asked the agency's staff to revisit restrictions for proxy advisers that the commission&#xa0;adopted in July 2020. The staff should also reconsider guidance aimed at defanging proxy advisers that the&#xa0;agency published in 2019, he said.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Lex</strong> <br>Made.com has confirmed plans to raise at least £100m in a premium listing on the London stock exchange. Bankers pin a valuation of about £1bn on the company. With household cash levels reasonably high there is no reason why Made.com cannot <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6b6ac06b-fb87-443c-9b5e-6794908284fc\">carve out</a> a comfortable domain. </p> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>Most pay debates boil down to board judgment. Where investors believe that the pay is unacceptable but the judgment of those in charge was fine, they should explain why. Where they really think pay is a problem, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/283830ba-c38c-47b6-a12e-aca963341275\">it's time to get more personal</a>.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Bloomsbury raises earnings forecasts after annual results beat expectations' FT.com 2 June.
