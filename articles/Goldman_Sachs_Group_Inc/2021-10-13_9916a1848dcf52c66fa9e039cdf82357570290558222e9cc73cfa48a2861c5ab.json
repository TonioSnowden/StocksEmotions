  "text": "<p>The UK bounceback resumed in August, when <strong>economic output</strong> increased by 0.4 per cent according to official estimates out this morning. But that was smaller than the 0.5 per cent increase economists had been expecting. </p> <p>And while the <strong>Office for National Statistics</strong> had previously estimated gross domestic product grew by 0.1 per cent in July, it revised that estimate down today to a 0.1 per cent fall in output. The ONS said data for carmaking and oil and gas had been revised downwards for July, while there had been improvements to how health output is measured which also brought down the July estimate. </p> <p>The gap between current and pre-pandemic output levels is closing, with GDP now 0.8 per cent below its February 2020 level. But output in all sectors remains below pre-Covid levels for now. </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>THG</strong> has put out a statement saying it knows of “no notifiable reason” for the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b88d9d9-1ee4-496c-ba8b-342659401401\">fall in its share price</a> yesterday, and that “no material new information was disclosed” at its capital markets day yesterday afternoon. Investors might say that was rather the issue, more on which below. Retailer <strong>JD Sports</strong> will be hoping for a rather quieter capital markets day today, while British Gas owner <strong>Centrica</strong> has postponed its event, which was planned for next month, given the chaos in the energy markets. </p> <p>The <strong>FRC</strong> has published the report of the independent disciplinary tribunal into KPMG's work for Silentnight between August 2010 and April 2011 (KPMG was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99b7b8ae-cabd-4a53-ac2d-927dad457f8d\">fined £13m</a> over the debacle in August). The tribunal found that KPMG and the former partner concerned “advanced an untruthful defence”, failed to co-operate with the FRC's investigation and that senior management failed to respond to regulatory criticism. The report into the sorry affair is <a href=\"https://www.frc.org.uk/getattachment/c35029a1-9fc7-4510-864b-89af38c3b502/KPMG-Silentnight-Tribunal-Report-13-10-21.pdf\">here</a>. </p> <p><strong>Darktrace</strong> and <strong>Barratt</strong> have published trading updates, as has listed hedge fund manager <strong>Man Group</strong>, which reported net inflows of $5.3bn. </p> <p>Finally, corporate communications group <strong>Finsbury Glover Hering</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/56e87dd8-0575-4d22-a866-4344303787fe\">tying up</a> with rival <strong>Sard Verbinnen &amp; Co</strong> in a deal that values SVC's equity at $303m and the combined group at $917m excluding debt. WPP will be the majority shareholder.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <p>Halfords has recruited <strong>Jo Hartley </strong>as its new CFO after incumbent Loraine Woodhouse announced retirement plans. Hartley joins from Virgin Active. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p>A <strong>KKR</strong>-led investor group is close to a $1.1bn deal for rights to hits from artists including Lorde and The Weeknd. Indie music group Kobalt is in advanced talks to sell the catalogue to a consortium which also includes the family office of former Goldman Sachs partner Stephen Hendl, our correspondents report, in the latest <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c46aed3-bf84-42e9-b9d1-28d580a0161f\">push by private equity</a> into the music business. </p> <p><strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> faces a €500m lawsuit in a widening forex scandal. One of Spain's biggest hotel groups is suing the bank over the alleged mis-selling of risky foreign exchange derivatives that it says <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97b44628-450a-4535-8605-d5a7b8e5cbff\">left it with crippling losses</a>.</p> <p>And chief executives of some of the world's largest banks have said they are confident supply chain disruptions are “transitory”. This will not be an issue next year at all,” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0dd1622d-883a-44a8-80c4-079fc5e90fab\">said JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon</a>. “This is the worst part of it and the great market system will adjust for it.” Here's hoping he's right.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p>Yesterday was <strong>THG's</strong> capital markets day. It did not go well for the company formerly known as The Hut Group. The event gets the Helen Thomas treatment <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc8095b7-5b9f-4b01-a3a9-a1a5e3d6e29f\">here</a>. But self-indulgently, I'd also suggest reading <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a86304fe-32e1-403f-8039-c5e339b1e8f2\">this column I wrote a year ago</a>. Then I said that so long as THG's “technology tinge” continued to win out, investors would hang on to their shirts (chief executive Matt Moulding is well-known for shedding his). The trouble is, that technology tinge seems to be fading fast. </p><p>Source: Cat Rutter Pooley 2021 'UK economy grows slower than expected' FT.com 13 October.
