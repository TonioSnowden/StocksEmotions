  "title": "Gerald Corrigan Led New York Fed During Wall Street Turmoil; Regulator and banker, who has died at age 80, played a central role in the Federal Reserve's responses to the 1987 stock-market crash, and Drexel Burnham Lambert and Salomon Brothers crises",
  "text": "<p>\"I thought of Corrigan as a kind of John Madden of finance,\" Timothy Geithner, who later ran the New York Fed, wrote in a memoir. Mr. Corrigan was \"big, gruff, old-school, a well-respected student of the game, with a similarly animated rhythm to his commentary.\"</p><p>Mr. Corrigan's term as president of the New York Fed from 1985 to 1993 is a reminder today that upheaval on Wall Street is a hardy perennial. It is also a window to the delicate balance that the Fed tries to strike in the financial system. Officials generally want to leave markets alone, only sometimes to get drawn into aggressive action, often reluctantly, when instability threatens to spread through waves of human fear in those same markets.</p><p>Mr. Corrigan played a central role organizing the Fed's response to a 1987 stock-market crash shortly after Alan Greenspan became chairman of the Fed board in Washington. Mr. Corrigan had been warning Mr. Greenspan about the risk of financial instability. When stock markets cratered in mid-October, officials considered issuing a long and technical statement about how they planned to respond.</p><p>\"I said that's the last damn thing we need. What we need is a statement that has about 10 words in it,\" Mr. Corrigan is quoted as saying in Sebastian Mallaby's biography of Mr. Greenspan, \"The Man Who Knew.\" The Fed just needed to say it would flood the financial system with money if needed. Saying anything else was superfluous. Mr. Greenspan followed his lead, issuing a 30-word statement that he likened to Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. Mr. Corrigan then called the heads of several large Wall Street banks and pressed them to keep lending, and the markets stabilized.</p><p>He later played a central role steering the Fed through the fall of investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1989 and the demise of Salomon Brothers in 1991. Along the way he developed a reputation as a no-nonsense regulator.</p><p>\"He had a real sense of right and wrong. If he thought you were right and you were being unfairly maligned, you would have no greater defender, and if he thought you were wrong, you didn't want to be on his wrong side,\" said Lloyd Blankfein, who was chief executive of Goldman Sachs from 2006 to 2018.</p><p>Edward Gerald Corrigan, known as Jerry, was born June 13, 1941, and grew up in Waterbury, Conn. His mother was a librarian, and his father owned and managed restaurants.</p><p>He earned an economics degree at Fairfield University in Connecticut in 1963 and later earned masters and doctoral degrees in economics at Fordham University in New York.</p><p>He taught for a year at Fordham before joining the research staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1968. Among those who noticed him was Paul Volcker, who was president of the New York Fed before becoming chairman of the Federal Reserve Board in 1979. In that new role, Mr. Volcker hired Mr. Corrigan as a special assistant.</p><p>\"I wanted somebody I knew I could lean on at the time,\" Mr. Volcker told the American Banker later. \"He's got a very practical bent of mind. He was a man you could expect would do what needed to be done without minute-by-minute guidance.\"</p><p>Mr. Corrigan served as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in the early 1980s and took on that role at the New York Fed in 1985. He joined Goldman Sachs in 1994.</p><p>In 1997, he told the New York Times that his work at Goldman involved advising clients on financial regulation and helping the firm's risk management committee on such matters as legal compliance and financial controls. After the financial crisis of 2007 to 2009, he led an examination of the firm's reputation and practices.</p><p>Mr. Corrigan's personal life became an issue in the mid-1990s when he became romantically involved with Cathy Minehan. She was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and he was a partner at Goldman Sachs, which created potential conflicts of interest because Goldman was active in so many markets in which the Fed operated.</p><p>Put on the spot by public discussions of these potential conflicts, Mr. Corrigan emerged from his usual reserve to address the issue. \"It's just one of those things,\" he told the Boston Globe. \"All of a sudden, lightning strikes.\" He and Ms. Minehan both consulted lawyers and came up with what they said were secure safeguards against any leaks of sensitive information to him.</p><p>They married in the fall of 1997. Ms. Minehan survives him, along with two daughters and two grandchildren from an earlier marriage.</p><p>Mr. Corrigan retired from Goldman Sachs in 2016.</p><p>Write to Jon Hilsenrath at jon.hilsenrath@wsj.com and James R.
