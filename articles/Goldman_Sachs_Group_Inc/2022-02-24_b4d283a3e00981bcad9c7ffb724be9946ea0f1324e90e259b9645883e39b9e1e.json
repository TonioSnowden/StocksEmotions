MarketWatch has reported on it here and here. But the notion of higher prices and sluggish growth, last experienced in the 1970s, is starting to look more like a possibility, given supply-chain shortages, $100 oil, chip shortages and the threat of all-out war in Ukraine, which could morph into something more severe and amplify problems.</p><p>“It's hard to have a crystal ball but&#xa0;I think the biggest concern for investors has to be a stagflation,” Davis told ETF Wrap.</p><p>She said in such an environment bonds and stocks could selloff together, with the Federal Reserve forced to raise rates, to tackle rising inflation.</p><p>“This stuff&#xa0;is really going to heat up inflation pressures,” she said.</p><p>She pointed to crude-oil pricesCL. 1BRN00 at around $100 and the threat that further embargoes against Moscow could drive futures prices into the stratosphere. “We already have supply-side shocks and labor-market shortages,” she said.</p><p>So what does, Davis recommend?</p><p>She said investors should consider their allocations to stocks and bonds.</p><p>The investor said traditional portfolio allocations where investors own a mix of 60% in stocks and 40% in fixed-income might be a loss-making recipe in this environment.</p><p>“I think it's time to rethink the 60/40 portfolio because investors need diversification,” she said.&#xa0;And the current climate makes it hard to determine “what's&#xa0;going to work.”</p><p>Davis said that investors sometimes make the mistake of owning bonds that tend to have similar beta to stocks, meaning they might not serve as a sufficient hedge against losses in a stagflationary environment.</p><p>You have to “make sure on the fixed-income&#xa0;side that you have something that is not the same beta,” she said.</p><p>Davis says a fund she rolled out in 2019, the Quadratic Interest Rate Volatility &amp; Inflation Hedge ETFIVOL, could be a good diversification bet for investors. The ETF is&#xa0;intended to move in and out of Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, and over-the-counter fixed-income options in a bid to beat the market. It has about $2.2 billion in assets and has an expense ratio of 1.05%, which means that the fund costs $10.05 in annual fees for every $1,000 invested.</p><p>Lest one think Davis is just talking her book, IVOL, referring to the fund's ticker, is up 1.1% on the day, up 0.5% in the week thus far, and down 2.2% on the year to date. By comparison, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF TLT is up 0.8% on the day, down 0.3% on the week and is looking at a 7% loss in 2022 so far.</p><p>Gold shines</p><p>Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and Mutual Fund Research at CFRA, who responded to us on vacation (sorry, Todd), offered a few ideas for investors amid the calamity unfolding in markets.</p><p>He has been seeing investors turn old school and heading for the safety of gold, including the SPDR Gold Shares GLD, which was up 1% on Thursday and headed for a weekly gain of 1.6%. GLD boasts some $61 billion in assets and carries an expense ratio of 0.40%.</p><p>“While GLD remains the largest, there are many lower-cost alternatives better suited for retail investors such as GLDM, IAUM, and AAAU,” Rosenbluth said.</p><p>He was referring to the tickers of SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust GLDM, iShares Gold Trust Micro ETF IAUM, and Goldman Sachs Physical ETF AAAU, which all have expense ratios ranging from 0.15% to 0.18%.</p><p>For the faint of heart, the CFRA analyst said lower-volatility and defined outcome ETFs, designed to mitigate the downside, might be a good wager. Those include Invesco S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility ETF SPLV and Innovator U.S. Equity Buffer ETF BFEB, which have fees of 0.25% and 0.79%, respectively.</p><p>Russia's very bad ETF day</p><p>The VanEck Russia ETF RSX&#xa0;plunged 26% Thursday, with all components tumbling, as&#xa0;Moscow's attack in and around Kyiv&#xa0;and fears of sanctions prompted investors to flee the fund. ETF Wrap has written about growing retail interest in the VanEck single-country ETF, which is down 48% on the year. If the current decline holds through the close it will represent sharpest one-day drop ever, surpassing the Nov. 12, 2008 fall of 22.32%, according to Dow Jones Market Data.</p><p>Meanwhile, the iShares MSCI Russia ETF ERUS was down nearly 19% and looking at its sharpest daily slump since March 9 of 2020.</p><p>FactSetThe downturn in Russia-pegged ETFs come as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was down more than 700 points, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX was down 1.5% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP was trading 0.6% (after a massive intraday recovery from a drop of 3.5% at the lows), at last check.</p><p>Capital Group's active</p><p>Capital Group is entering the ETF fray, marking what Rosenbluth described as a milestone “for active ETFs given that the firm managed $2.6 trillion in assets overall at the end of 2021.” It has been one of the biggest fund providers not to offer funds in the popular ETF wrapper—until now.</p><p>The fund manager is kicking off six actively managed ETFs:</p><p>Capital Group Growth ETF CGGRCapital Group Core Equity ETF CGUSCapital Group Dividend Value ETF CGDVCapital Group International Focus Equity ETF CGXUCapital Group Global Growth Equity ETF CGGOCapital Group Core Plus Income ETF (CGCP)</p><p>Tim Armour, chairman and CEO of Capital Group, said that active ETFs “will be transformative for the industry” and that Capital aims to be a market leader.</p><p>Popular ETF Reads</p><p>ETF investors pile into Russian equities and defense stocks (FT.com)</p><p>These commodity ETFs can help hedge against geopolitical tensions, market analyst says (CNBC)</p><p>Russian stocks, ETFs get pummeled as Ukraine tensions escalate (Fox Business)</p><p>ARKK ETF: Performance So Bad, It Starts Looking Bullish (Seeking Alpha)</p>",
