  "title": "U.S. Stocks Fall With Focus on Fed; Central bank officials are expected to raise interest rates by 0.75 percentage point Wednesday",
  "text": "<p>Traders are shuffling their holdings ahead of Wednesday, when Fed officials are expected to raise interest rates by another 0.75 percentage point. Remarks by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell could bring clues about whether the Fed may slow the size and pace of rate increases, or whether concerns over elevated inflation could require them to continue strong efforts to tame it.</p><p>For most of the year, the Fed's fastest interest-rate increases since the 1980s have battered markets, but signs of moderation in October helped propel stocks toward monthly gains. The Dow is on track to gain 13% this month, its best monthly result since 1976. In October speeches, some Fed officials said it was time to consider whether December should bring a slower pace of tightening as the central bank tries to balance controlling inflation and avoiding a sharp economic contraction.</p><p>Specifically, investors want to know if the following Fed meeting, in December, will bring yet another 0.75-percentage-point rate increase, or whether the Fed will downshift to a half-percentage-point move. Bets in futures markets show that traders see roughly even odds of either outcome, according to CME Group.</p><p>\"I'm anticipating hearing Powell walking a fine line, trying to point out some of the positive data without the market taking it as a full blown pivot,\" said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, of his expectations for Mr. Powell's remarks Wednesday.</p><p>Despite central bankers' recent remarks, economists caution that high inflation—still at an 8.2% annual rate in September—will keep the Fed on track to bring rates higher well into next year. Over the weekend, economists at Goldman Sachs raised their estimate of how high the Fed's target interest rate will eventually climb, forecasting rate increases through March. The bank now expects the Fed's target to reach 4.75% to 5%, up from the current range of 3% to 3.25%.</p><p>The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which closely tracks monetary-policy expectations, rose to 4.474%, from 4.422% on Friday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 4.05% from 4.009% Friday. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>The European Central Bank raised interest rates last week but signaled mounting concerns about economic growth, prompting investors to bet that the bank will soon reduce the scale of its rate increases. Still, hotter-than-expected inflation has caused markets to rethink that likelihood. Fresh data showed that the eurozone's annual inflation rate reached 10.7% in October.</p><p>\"Until we see the monetary policy decision or major macroeconomic data, there's likely to be a lack of direction,\" said Edward Park, chief investment officer at U.K. investment firm Brooks Macdonald. \"The market is hoping that the Federal Reserve, akin to the ECB, will make a bit of a nod to slowing the pace of incremental rate rises.\"</p><p>Investors are also poring over third-quarter earnings, which have helped boost some companies such as United Airlines and JPMorgan, whose reports showed resilience in a turbulent economy. This week, nearly a third of the S&amp;P 500 companies will post their latest results.</p><p>In morning trading, tech stocks were among those that led the S&amp;P 500's losses. Apple shares fell 1.4% as Foxconn, a major contributor to Apple's iPhone production, struggled with a Covid-19 outbreak at a factory in China. Facebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, lost 4.7%, continuing last week's slide that followed a disappointing earnings report.</p><p>Energy stocks rose after oil companies posted strong profits to finish last week. Devon Energy rose 2.1%, Chevron gained 1.6% and ConocoPhillips was up 1.5%.</p><p>The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against a basket of other currencies, added 0.7%.</p><p>Chicago wheat futures rose 5.5% to $8.75 a bushel after Russia said that it would suspend participation in the export of agricultural products from Ukrainian ports. If shipments of Ukrainian grain are halted, the suspension will likely drive up the global price of wheat, corn and other vital food products. Corn rose 2% to $6.94 a bushel.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, fell 0.7% to $93.05 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.2%.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes closed with mixed performances. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 1.8% and South Korea's Kospi added 1.1%. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng shed 1.2% and China's Shanghai Composite fell 0.8%.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Matt Grossman at matt.grossman@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Stocks Fall With Focus on Fed</p>",
