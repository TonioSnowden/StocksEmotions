  "text": "<h1>Andrew Lindsay: a tough row to hoe</h1> <p>The sharp rise in <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f0548d3-e3f6-448e-a845-c3bc1bd8008c\">global energy costs</a> has not been a crisis for everyone. For Andrew Lindsay of Telecom Plus, whose Utility Warehouse business is the UK's ninth biggest energy supplier, it has been vindication.</p> <p>“We've been here before,” Lindsay told City Insider. “We've been in business for 20 years. We've been patiently waiting for our opportunity.”</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a5536944-51c3-11e3-8c42-00144feabdc0\">Telecom Plus</a> has an agreement with Eon whereby the German utility supplies energy at a permanent fixed discount to the UK's retail price cap and takes on all hedging risks. The longstanding deal allowed Utility Warehouse to be undercut by suppliers taking a more short-term approach, which made things tricky for its network of 45,000 freelance agents who earn bonuses by selling its multi-utility broadband and energy service to friends and family. </p> <p>But with soaring wholesale prices now squeezing rival suppliers out of the market, Utility Warehouse is among the few still willing to take on new customers for cheaper tariffs than the price cap. Its shares rose more than 10 per cent this week after Utility Warehouse reassured customers it was <a href=\"https://uw.co.uk/about-us/latest-news/you-re-in-good-hands-with-uw-during-the-current-energy-crisis\">insulated from the storm</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a14fb3c0-a665-4320-8980-2b5c2156269c\">Spiralling wholesale energy prices</a> have exposed “systemic flaws” across the sector but government intervention beyond temporary stop-gap measures is unwarranted, said Lindsay, a former Goldman Sachs M&amp;A banker who became Telecom Plus's chief executive in 2010.</p> <p>“Energy markets are cyclical. We learned back in 2005 that you get wholesale price spikes. But everyone's conveniently forgotten about that,” he said. “The government is treading the right line here by not letting the incumbents muscle in and stifle competition, but equally not bailing out insolvent suppliers and prolonging the overdue and much-needed reset of unsustainable pricing practices.”</p> <h1>Sands Capital: each way accumulator </h1> <p>A bid approach for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/613a232a-5a77-4e58-a3b2-4a3af69af88f\">bookmaker Entain</a> is a big win for Sands Capital, the US investment group that emerged from nowhere three months ago to become its biggest shareholder. </p> <p>Virginia-based Sands Capital first revealed its Entain stake in June after crossing the 5 per cent UK disclosure threshold for overseas funds, having been buying the stock since the third quarter of 2019. Its only other London market punt of scale was in 2015 on <a href=\"https://www.investegate.co.uk/asos-plc--asc-/rns/holding-s--in-company/201506121206130430Q/\">online retailer Asos</a>. </p> <p>US regulatory filings show that Sands Capital more than trebled its Entain stake over the second quarter of 2021 with the purchase of about 31m shares, then valued at approximately £500m. Following DraftKings' bid approach for Entain, those shares are worth more than £850m.</p> <p>Whether Sands Capital can repeat the trick is another matter. In July its lead gambling analyst Davis Catlin left <a href=\"https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/lv-sands-announces-investment-in-digital-gaming-new-leader-2398428/\">to join casino operator</a> Las Vegas Sands (no relation). </p> <h1>Ken Costa: blanca cheque</h1> <p>The last days of the Spac craze have drawn out City grandee Ken Costa, who wants to carve out a niche in ethical estate planning for super-rich millennials. </p> <p>Alvarium Investments, the merchant bank Costa co-chairs, this week revealed plans to merge with US family office management specialist Tiedemann and reverse on to Nasdaq via the special purpose acquisition vehicle Cartesian Growth. The idea is to build a global wealth manager that concentrates on impact investment, ESG and innovation.</p> <p>“There is a massive generational change taking place,” he said. “Seventy trillion dollars are going to move from the boomers to the Zoomers in ten years.” Next in line is “a generation that doesn't just want to give its money to someone to invest. They want to do well and do good.” </p> <p>Costa, a former chair of Lazard International, said Alvarium took the Spac route because a public listing would make it easier to cut deals and add to its $60bn of assets under advisement. “Consolidation is inevitable in this sector, globally,” he said. “To have cash and a listed security is a huge advantage.”</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Soaring energy prices are no stress for Utility Warehouse' FT.com 23 September.
