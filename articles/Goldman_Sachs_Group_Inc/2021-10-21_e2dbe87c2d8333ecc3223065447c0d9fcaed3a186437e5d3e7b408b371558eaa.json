Activists are condemning Netflix for carrying programming they say could encourage <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f41bf4e4-0e87-4d28-ab24-a985fa0be3a2\">discrimination</a> against transgender people, resulting in one of the platform's worst public relations crises.</p> <p><strong>The revenge of the old economy </strong>It is tempting to blame today's shortages on temporary disruptions driven by the pandemic.

This theory, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a31068b4-76c1-439c-8cc3-faca24891253\">argues Gillian Tett</a>, ignores the psychological impact they will have.</p> <p><strong>Europe after Angela Merkel </strong>The German chancellor will reprise the role of mediator as European leaders prepare for a showdown with Poland over the primacy of EU law. This time there is a difference: Merkel is on the way out. Will Germany's new coalition take a <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/1f4272e8-c995-4008-96b2-9de988d1d53c\">tough approach</a> on foreign policy?</p> <p><em>Thanks to readers who took our poll yesterday. Seventy per cent of you said that Washington lawmakers, rather than Wall Street, had the right approach to US relations with China.</em></p> <h1>Meet our journalists: Robin Harding</h1> <p><em>Robin Harding took up the role of the FT's Asia editor in mid-August. An economist by training, he has served in a variety of posts, from London to Washington to Tokyo, where he was bureau chief from 2015.</em></p> <p><strong>What story are you particularly interested in at the moment?</strong></p> <p>The potential default of Chinese property company Evergrande, less in itself than for what it says about the Chinese growth model. One of the big questions for this century is whether China can keep growing until it's as rich as Japan, or even the United States. How China tackles Evergrande will offer clues to the answer.</p> <p><strong>You've lived in Japan for almost 12 years. What about the country continues to fascinate you?</strong></p> <p>Japan is different. I think one reason for Japan's tourism boom, pre-Covid-19, is because it's a rich, industrialised country that still feels alien to Europeans or Americans. I'm constantly learning from how Japan does things, and the comparison sheds light on the rest of the world, whether the subject is monetary policy, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/023562e2-54a6-11e6-befd-2fc0c26b3c60\">urban planning</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f7f044e-1f16-11e9-b2f7-97e4dbd3580d\">railways</a>.</p> <p><strong>What's the best book you've read in the last year?</strong></p> <p>I went back through my Kindle and I reread <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> this year, so that's the real answer. The best newish non-fiction was <em>The WEIRDest People in the World</em>, which basically argues that the Catholic church created the modern world by banning cousin marriage in Europe.
