  "title": "Goldman Sachs and B Capital Back MoEngage; The $77 million investment will help the digital marketing and customer experience company expand",
  "text": "<p>MoEngage added about 500 clients over the past year and more than doubled its annual recurring revenue, a key measure for businesses that offer services by subscription. At the same time, MoEngage doubled its workforce, which now numbers more than 650 employees, according to Raviteja Dodda, a co-founder and the company's chief executive.</p><p>Brands use MoEngage systems to create customer profiles, including individual behavior and preferences, drawn from their own information and third-party data. MoEngage's artificial intelligence-based products analyze the client company's customer interactions and offer insights that companies use to tailor customer communications across channels, from mobile push notices to email and in-app messaging. This relationship-building can help companies reduce customer churn and increase sales to existing customers, MoEngage says.</p><p>Kabir Narang, a founding general partner at venture investor B Capital who co-leads its Asia investment team, said that backing MoEngage fits into the firm's focus on cross-border software-as-a-service providers. He added that B Capital has also been interested in the application of digital technologies to customer support services.</p><p>\"There is really a rising demand for better user experience,\" Mr. Narang said, adding that communications are shifting from traditional methods like text messages and email to newer, interactive channels.</p><p>For example, companies can integrate Facebook customer data on MoEngage's dashboard to send a nudge to those who have selected products to purchase but haven't bought anything yet, according to MoEngage's website.</p><p>Companies could create personalized Facebook ads to target users who have interacted with their websites, while choosing not to show a Facebook ad to those who bought something in the past three days.</p><p>Further, Mr. Narang said, companies know that bringing in new customers is more expensive than investing in existing customers. Among its own portfolio companies, B Capital has seen a need for a service like MoEngage to reduce churn and understand customers' needs, he said.</p><p>Rajat Sood, a managing director of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, also pointed to the growth of automated marketing and related analytics as companies seek to improve their interactions with customers across digital channels.</p><p>Mr. Dodda and Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur classmate Yashwanth Kumar founded MoEngage in 2014, with Mr. Kumar serving as chief technology officer.</p><p>\"We provide all the tools for the brands to make messaging less frequent and less intrusive and make it more personal,\" Mr. Dodda said.</p><p>At Maisonette Inc., an online seller of baby and children's products created by former Vogue magazine co-workers Sylvana Durrett and Luisana Mendoza de Roccia, MoEngage's products collect data on what customers search for and what they select to buy, then send personalized messages to shoppers suggesting additional products based on past purchases, Mr. Dodda said. MoEngage's systems help optimize such customer messages as well as when and how they are sent, he said.</p><p>The latest cash infusion will help MoEngage build out its operations and expand into Latin America, Australia and New Zealand, he said.</p><p>Existing investors Steadview Capital, Multiples Alternate Asset Management, Fidelity Investments-backed Eight Roads Ventures, and Matrix Partners India also participated in the Series E investment. MoEngage received a combined $62.5 million from two earlier investment rounds last year, in July and December.</p><p>Write to Maria Armental at maria.armental@wsj.com</p>",
