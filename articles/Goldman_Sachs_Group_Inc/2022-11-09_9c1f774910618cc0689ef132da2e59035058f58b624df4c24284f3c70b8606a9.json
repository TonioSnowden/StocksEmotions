  "text": "<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. promoted 80 bankers into its partnership on Wednesday, the biggest class since Chief Executive David Solomon took over in 2018.</p><p>Top brass in recent years had come to view the partnership as less prestigious than it once was, and Mr. Solomon has been trying to restore its allure, in part by elevating fewer people. Goldman promoted 60 new partners in 2020 and 69 in 2018. Both times, it marked the smallest class in two decades.</p><p>Last year, though, Goldman named its largest-ever class of managing directors, the final role before a coveted partnership. The bank said at the time that the bigger 2021 class reflected, in part, its investments in its asset-management and consumer arms.</p><p>Partners are selected every two years, making the 2022 class the third under Mr. Solomon.</p><p>The Wall Street giant is undertaking a restructuring, part of a yearslong effort to bulk up businesses such as wealth and asset management that can generate steady fees regardless of market conditions. That will help the bank rely less on the high-risk, high-reward Wall Street businesses that have long been its powerhouse, such as investment banking and trading.</p><p>Write to AnnaMaria Andriotis at annamaria.andriotis@wsj.com</p><p>Goldman Sachs's 80 New Partners Are the Happiest People on Wall Street Today</p>",
