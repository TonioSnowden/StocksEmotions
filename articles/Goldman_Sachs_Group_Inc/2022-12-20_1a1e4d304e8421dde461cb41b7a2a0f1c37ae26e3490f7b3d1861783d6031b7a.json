  "text": "<p>I find the decision of Goldman Sachs to cut about 4,000 jobs to improve profits (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bfac6875-5256-4ec9-9286-3e1cc6596d31\">Report</a>, December 17) simply wrong. Profits go up and down, but employee loyalty does not waver. </p> <p>As an employer myself for a third of a century now — I am the founder and chairman of an audit firm — I know that good people are not easy to find, so when you do find them you keep them. </p> <p>You can reduce the headcount to save a business, but not to increase profits for the shareholders. For without a congruence of goals between stakeholders — employers, shareholders and employees alike — you will damage the business in the medium term and beyond. By that time of course those bosses who seek higher profits at the cost of their employees may well have moved on to other jobs, so they don't have to suffer the consequences of their decisions.</p> <p>In another business in Bulgaria I was involved in — the Costa Coffee franchise — during Covid we let go none of our staff; we cut salaries but not jobs and now Costa in Bulgaria is among the best-performing franchises in Europe and the Middle East.</p> <p>An employer's loyalty matters too.</p> <p><strong>Christos Rotsas</strong> <br><em>Former Member of Parliament <br>Nicosia, Cyprus</em> </p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Goldman Sachs' planned lay-offs are ‘simply wrong'' FT.com 20 December.
