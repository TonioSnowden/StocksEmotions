  "title": "Thursday's Markets:  Stocks Abroad Rise  On Hopes for Pivot  ----  By Anna Hirtenstein",
  "text": "<p>   Stocks in Europe and Asia edged up following release of Federal Reserve minutes that revealed most officials expect to slow the pace of interest-rate increases. </p><p>   U.S. markets were closed for Thanksgiving after rallying in the previous session following the Fed minutes. </p><p>   Asian stock indexes rose, playing catch-up to the U.S. gains. Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.8%. The Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.5%. </p><p>   Early Friday, Asian markets moved mostly lower. Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 0.3%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 0.8% and South Korea's Kospi was down 0.3%. Markets in mainland China rose, with the CSI 300 index up 0.6%. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.2%. </p><p>   Recent economic data, including U.S. purchasing managers' surveys and jobless claims, were weaker than expected. These were interpreted to mean the U.S. central bank might not have to tighten financial conditions much more, investors said. The Fed release Wednesday added support to the idea that future monetary policy may be less aggressive. </p><p>   \"Markets are banking on this idea that central banks will have to respond to this growth slowdown. This has boosted sentiment,\" said Karim Chedid, an investment strategist at BlackRock. </p><p>   Shifting expectations for interest rates have somewhat deflated the dollar, after a big run-up in the U.S. currency earlier this year. On Wednesday, the WSJ Dollar Index declined to its lowest since mid-August. The gauge, which measures the dollar's performance against a basket of other currencies, fell further Thursday, declining 0.3%. Notable gainers against the dollar included the Japanese yen and British pound. </p><p>   Another focus for investors is the Chinese government's response to rising Covid-19 cases. </p><p>   The authorities' tough response is squashing hopes for an economic rebound and fanning concern about disruption to the world's supply chains. Still, Mr. Chedid at BlackRock said the action was comparatively measured, limiting its likely impact. </p><p>   \"If you look this morning, we're still not seeing outright citywide lockdowns. They're following this targeted approach,\" he said. </p><p>   In commodity markets, oil prices declined, with Brent crude, the global pricing benchmark, falling 0.1% to $85.34 a barrel. </p><p>   Group of Seven leaders are continuing discussions on a price cap for Russian oil, which if successful could lead to more supply to global markets. A higher cap is being considered which could avoid retaliation from Russia, wrote Callum Bruce, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. </p><p></p>",
