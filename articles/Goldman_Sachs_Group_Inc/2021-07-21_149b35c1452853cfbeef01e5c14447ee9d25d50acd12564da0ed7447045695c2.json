  "text": "<p>Next raised profit guidance after recent sales came in materially ahead of expectations. </p> <p>The retailer pulled forward a trading update by two weeks to report that full-price sales in the eleven weeks to mid July were up 18.6 per cent versus two years ago.</p> <p>Its guidance for full price sales for the rest of the year went from at least 3 per cent growth to at least 6 per cent.&#xa0;For the full year ending January, Next raised its midpoint target for pre-tax profit by £30m to £750m, towards the top of its previous guidance. Surplus cash of £240m will be distributed to shareholders through special dividends during the current financial year, the first of which will be paid in September, it added.</p> <p>Next also revealed that, having consulted with shareholders, it had decided to repay £29m of business rates relief to the government. This sum accounts for the period of time this year that its shops were not charged business rates but were open.&#xa0; </p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Royal Mail</strong> cautioned that a slowdown in parcel volumes is holding back performance as pandemic restrictions ease. The company said parcel volumes in its UK business fell 13 per cent in the three months ended June 30. It reported a 12.5 per cent rise in group revenue for the quarter.</p> <p><strong>Bridgepoint</strong>, the private equity group, announced an offer price on its flotation of 350p to give the company a debut market capitalisation of £2.9bn.&#xa0;Bridgepoint raised gross proceeds of £300m with the sale of 85.7m share to fund investment and pay down debt, with existing shareholders selling a further 139.7m shares excluding the overallotment option.</p> <p><strong>Future</strong>, the magazine publisher, said full year profitability will be materially ahead of current market expectations. It said robust digital advertising revenue and ongoing ecommerce product affiliate revenue growth had added to an in-line performance from both the magazines division and its recently acquired GoCo price comparison website. </p> <p>Estate agent <strong>Foxtons</strong> said in response to press speculation that it is reviewing strategic options for Alexander Hall Associates, its mortgage broking business, which could include the potential sale of the business.</p> <p><strong>Computacenter</strong> said robust trading through the first half will deliver an adjusted pre-tax profit circa 50 per cent ahead of the same period last year. In spite of component shortages and a strengthening of the pound against other currencies, 2021 “will be another year of substantial progress for the group,” the IT contractor said.</p> <p>Defence technology group <strong>Qinetiq</strong> said it had made a good start to the new financial year with revenue, profit and cash all in-line with expectations.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Wickes</strong>, the builders' merchant, said it was on track to meet guidance after posting like-for-like sales up 33.1 per cent year on year in the 26 weeks to late June. The strong performance continued into the current quarter with like-for-like sales up 47.6 per cent versus 2020, it said. </p> <p><strong>Speedy Hire</strong> said that from the end of July it will cease provision of National Vocational Qualifications and Apprenticeships to concentrate instead on short duration training courses. The tool hire specialist said recent trading has been in line with expectations.</p> <p>Gold miner <strong>Petropavlovsk</strong> said first-half production dropped 39 per cent to 195,000 ounces as it prepared to switch mining processes. Gold supplied from third parties for processing dropped 66 per cent to just 36,700 ounces. The company, whose new chief executive Denis Alexandrov expects to deliver a strategic review in the current quarter, left full-year production targets unchanged. </p> <p><strong>Close Brothers</strong> said in an update ahead of its July year end that trading has been strong, with high levels of activity in banking, good net inflows to its asset management business and strong trading income at brokerage Winterflood.</p> <p>Book publisher <strong>Bloomsbury</strong> reported revenue up 28 per cent to £63m in the four months to June and said it was “actively targeting further acquisition opportunities”. Results for the year to February 2022 should be in line with market expectations, it said.</p> <p><strong>BHP</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c27a671-2c6a-4d46-a94d-3c0030a02e44\">examining options</a> for its oil and gas assets including a sale, as the miner looks to focus on commodities that will be needed in the shift to a low-carbon economy, people familiar with the matter told the FT.</p> <p><strong>Rio Tinto</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/89078101-cca2-4b92-b78c-c9c37ca89788\">agreed to co-fund</a> a study into the environmental and human rights impact of a shuttered mine in the South Pacific that sparked a civil war, which could lay out clean-up costs amounting to billions of dollars. </p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Netflix</strong> lost 430,000 subscribers in the US and Canada in the second quarter and issued weaker than expected forecasts,&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97ccbdab-6547-4d1b-bb3f-f251931901c2\">rekindling investor doubts</a>&#xa0;about how the market leader will fare after the economic reopening from the pandemic.</p> <p><strong>Tom Barrack</strong>, the former chief executive of Colony Capital who was one of Donald Trump's earliest supporters in the 2016 presidential campaign, has been arrested and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83e5dfbf-fb11-4f62-8242-920e817adea6\">charged with illegally acting as an agent</a> of the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p><strong>Nasdaq</strong> is to separate its platform for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25a35831-d106-49ac-8d3b-6fc6cb99284a\">share dealing in private companies</a> in move that will see the exchange partner with SVB Financial, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in a bid it hopes will boost dealmaking activity. The venture would “develop a full suite of liquidity solutions for private companies”, Nasdaq said.</p> <p><strong>UBS</strong> has launched a portfolio that invests solely <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dab5a2b3-c083-411b-b2d1-969d6bcf862b\">in&#xa0;hedge funds led by women</a>&#xa0;in an effort to improve diversity and spot talent in the male-dominated sector. Female representation in hedge funds, at 18.6 per cent, is the second-lowest across seven alternative asset classes.</p> <p><strong>Google</strong> and&#xa0;Mukesh Ambani's&#xa0;<strong>Jio</strong> are hoping to crack one of the world's largest untapped smartphone markets, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/73f2b76c-3edc-490d-b30e-6407fb69e9db\">launching a device</a> they hope will be cheap enough to convert 450m Indians on “dumb” handsets into smartphone users. The JioPhone Next will run a custom version of Google's Android operating system and cost around $50.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Martin Wolf</strong> <br>Central banks have to adapt to digital currencies and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a93fb0a-ae95-44fc-a3d2-1398ef0ce1af\">play a leading role</a> in building faster, safer and cheaper payment systems, available to all. It is crucial that the natural monopoly of money and the public good of a payment system does not morph into private monopolies of digital giants.</p> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>A proposed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a55b3862-971d-48a2-913a-9bd4ee5e2c1e\">update of the Companies Act</a> to replace the word “employee” with workforce, thereby including indirectly-employed&#xa0;workers, is more than a tidying-up exercise. Investors should want a more complete picture of who is contributing to a company's success and how they are treated.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'Upbeat Next lifts profits guidance, pays special dividend and repays business rates relief' FT.com 21 July.
