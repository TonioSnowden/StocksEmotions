  "title": "U.S. News:  Lasry Exits U.S. Senate Race  Ahead of Wisconsin Primary  ----  By John McCormick",
  "text": "<p>   Alex Lasry dropped out of the U.S. Senate race in Wisconsin on Wednesday, a departure that could boost Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes ahead of the Aug. 9 primary in a contest to determine Republican Sen. Ron Johnson's challenger in November. </p><p>   The former Goldman Sachs analyst and son of Marc Lasry, a billionaire hedge-fund manager and co-owner of the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, had invested at least $12.3 million of his own money in the campaign. </p><p>   \"It's become clear in the last few weeks that Wisconsin voters have decided that they want Lt. Governor Mandela Barnes to be our Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate,\" Mr. Lasry said in a statement, adding that he was endorsing Mr. Barnes and that the party should focus on the goal of unseating Mr. Johnson. </p><p>   Polling had shown Mr. Lasry closely trailing Mr. Barnes. </p><p>   State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski remains the only other top-tier candidate in the race besides Mr. Barnes. Tom Nelson, the top elected official in a county southwest of Green Bay, dropped out earlier this week and endorsed Mr. Barnes. </p><p>   The departure of Mr. Lasry, 35 years old, was earlier reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. </p><p>   \"I am so grateful to Alex for all of the work he's done to move Wisconsin forward, and I'm proud to have his endorsement,\" Mr. Barnes said in a statement. \"I deeply admire Alex's commitment to creating good union jobs and raising wages throughout his career and throughout this campaign, and the work he's done to bring pride and opportunity to Milwaukee.\" </p><p>   The November contest, in a state won by President Biden by less than 1 percentage point in the 2020 presidential election, is among about a half dozen nationally that are expected to determine control of the Senate. </p><p>   In an interview Saturday in Milwaukee with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Lasry called himself the \"best candidate to not only beat Ron Johnson, but also deliver\" results for voters. He declined to criticize Mr. Barnes and said he didn't think Democratic primary voters were holding his wealth against him. </p><p>   Absentee voting for the primary has already started and the names of candidates who have dropped out are already on printed ballots. </p><p></p>",
