  "title": "U.K. Leadership Front-Runner Rishi Sunak Gains Key Backers; Former Treasury chief pledges a 'return to traditional conservative economic values'",
  "text": "<p>\"We need a return to traditional conservative economic values, that means honesty and responsibility. Not fairy tales,\" said Mr. Sunak, promising to cut taxes once the economy is on a stronger footing.</p><p>To accelerate the process to find a new prime minister, the ruling Conservative Party declared that candidates must have the backing of at least 20 fellow Tory lawmakers by Tuesday evening, in the hopes of narrowing the field before the first round of voting on Wednesday. Lawmakers will hold more votes over the next week, knocking out weaker candidates until a final two are selected. The winners then have to woo some 150,000 members of the Conservative Party who vote to choose the party's leader.</p><p>The process kick-started a round of horse trading in Westminster as Conservative lawmakers look to parlay support for future top jobs in government. While the contest is still at an early stage, battle lines are emerging between small-state conservatives and those seen as more centrist candidates who favor short-term tax increases to bolster state coffers. The latter faction is led by former banker Mr. Sunak. On Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab, a former foreign secretary and Brexit figurehead, and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced their support for Mr. Sunak.</p><p>Up against him is Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who Tuesday received the backing of two prominent Brexit supporters in Mr. Johnson's cabinet. Penny Mordaunt, a trade minister, is seen as Ms. Truss's most likely rival to face off against Mr. Sunak in the final round, analysts say. Ms. Mordaunt, an early Brexit backer, is a favorite among the wider Conservative Party. A poll by ConservativeHome, a Tory news website, found Tuesday that Ms. Mordaunt is the most popular candidate with members of the party, with Mr. Sunak third.</p><p>In the coming days, much will hinge on which candidate can get the support of the libertarian wing of the party and build momentum into the monthlong campaign to win over Conservative members across the country. Oddsmakers say that Mr. Sunak is still the favorite to win overall.</p><p>With inflation at a four-decade high, and the looming threat of stagflation setting in, candidates are split how to stimulate the economy. Ms. Truss has pledged immediate tax cuts, indicating in a newspaper article that she would seek to refinance existing debt over a longer time scale. Others are promising a smorgasbord of cuts ranging from fuel-duty reductions to the axing of a planned increase in corporation tax next year.</p><p>\"The truth is that the last Government hasn't moved far enough or fast enough,\" said Tom Tugendhat, another candidate for the job. The Conservative Party has been in government since 2010.</p><p>Mr. Sunak, who oversaw fiscal policy until last week, is pledging continuity. He says it would be unwise to promise unfunded tax cuts while the economy faces large headwinds from the pandemic, war in Europe and high inflation.</p><p>The 42-year-old, who started his career at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. before later joining hedge fund Theleme Partners, is the U.K.'s richest politician. He is the son-in-law of N.R. Narayana Murthy, founder of Indian software company Infosys Technologies Ltd.</p><p>After joining Mr. Johnson's government, he was quickly promoted to chancellor of the exchequer, where he became known for a jobs-support package during the pandemic. He has since announced several tax raises, in part to help prop up the country's nationalized health service.</p><p>On Tuesday, Mr. Sunak looked to calm some of the allegations that he was responsible for toppling his former boss, Mr. Johnson. Mr. Sunak said the prime minister is a \"remarkable man.\"</p><p>\"Is he flawed? Yes. And so are the rest of us.\"</p><p>Write to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com</p><p>U.K. Leadership Front-Runner Rishi Sunak Gains Key Backers</p>",
