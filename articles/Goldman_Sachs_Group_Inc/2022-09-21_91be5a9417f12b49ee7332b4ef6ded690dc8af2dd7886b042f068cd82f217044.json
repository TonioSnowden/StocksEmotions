  "title": "Banking & Finance: Goldman Program Helps Entrepreneurs Grow Their Business",
  "text": "<p>John Rogers, a top Goldman executive, addressed the audience. \"When I look out in this room and see all of you, I see America,\" he said. The crowd roared.</p><p>Goldman earns billions of dollars a year advising moguls and giant corporations. Behind the scenes, small-business owners are getting its gold-plated services free.</p><p>Since 2009, Goldman has handpicked over a thousand business owners annually for a monthslong crash course in entrepreneurship. It helps them secure loans from community banks and meetings with lawmakers. Goldman says it hosted about 400 meetings with lawmakers at its summer confab.</p><p>It is all part of the bank's 10,000 Small Businesses program, an idea Goldman executives dreamed up in the depths of the financial crisis. Accusations that the bank misled investors to profit on the housing market's collapse had badly tarnished its reputation. What better way to repair it, the thinking went, than to team up with America's most-respected institutions: small businesses?</p><p>Business owners who have gone through the program say Goldman has helped them grow their companies and forge connections in Washington. Lawmakers get Goldman's help connecting with some of their most politically engaged constituents. Some 90% of program participants plan to vote in November's midterm elections, a recent survey found.</p><p>For Goldman, the benefit is subtle, but valuable: In serving as the bridge between lawmakers and their local businesses, the Wall Street firm gets to exercise a kind of soft power on Main Street. And what is good for Main Street is good for big banks like Goldman, which rise and fall with the health of the broader economy.</p><p>\"Driving inclusive economic growth starts with supporting small businesses,\" said Asahi Pompey, a Goldman partner who oversees the program.</p><p>Goldman has spent about $750 million on the program in total. Some 13,000 business owners have graduated since its inception. The program runs in 19 locations around the U.S., and it recently expanded to France and the U.K.</p><p>When Jessica Johnson-Cope took over her family's 16-employee security-services business in Bronx, N.Y., from her father in 2008, revenue had dwindled to a fraction of its prior highs. She heard about the Goldman program from a friend, applied and was accepted into its inaugural class.</p><p>The program gave her more confidence to negotiate effectively and successfully apply for government contracts, among other skills, Ms. Johnson-Cope said. Today, Johnson Security Bureau has more than 150 employees.</p>",
