In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f14b3205-f140-4e74-8743-04b881b63134\">my column</a> this week I've examined if anything has really changed in management over the past decade, given the high hopes of organisational evangelists such as Gary Hamel. As he told me, management tends to advance through a combination of “revolutionary goals and evolutionary steps”.</p> <blockquote>  <p>For <strong>my challenge</strong> this week, what do you think has been the most important change in how we run organisations in the past 10 years? Send your brief thoughts to <strong>bschool@ft.com</strong>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Last week, I asked you how the metaverse might improve management. <strong>Kaylee Brown</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wozbot1982/status/1458480871024074756?s=21\">on Twitter</a> (@wozbot1982) was sceptical: “Until we have AR [augmented reality] contact lenses or even actual wetware in our heads I don't see the metaverse taking off…it'll be like 3D TVs.” <strong>Basil Towers</strong> thinks the metaverse could “help leaders and managers understand and appreciate the people they need to support them” but points out that there is an existing real-life alternative: “For leaders and managers to get out, meet and give time to listening and responding to real people inside and outside their businesses. This,” he adds, sadly, “has never caught on.”</p> <p>In further reading, a <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/11/goldman-sachs-analysts-money-pandemic.html\">compelling look</a> by Jen Wieczner of New York magazine, at the revolt of exhausted junior Wall Street analysts earlier this year and its consequences: extra perks and pay for many. Even so, that wasn't enough for some. One Goldman Sachs junior, who ultimately quit the bank, says: “When I thought about it bigger-picture —&#xa0;<em>How much difference does it really make in your life?</em>&#xa0;— I decided that my happiness was worth more than a few hundred thousand extra dollars.”</p> <p><strong>Data line</strong></p> <p>Men still make up the majority of the student cohort on MBA and EMBA programmes, as well as business school faculty. However, the number of women is increasing over time — not only as students but also as members of faculty and school boards, <em>write Sam Stephens and Leo Cremonezi</em>.</p> <p>See <a href=\"https://rankings.ft.com/rankings/2863/emba-2021\">full EMBA ranking</a> and read <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebe71489-c5fd-415d-a785-79352ea18c20\">further analysis</a>.</p> <p><strong>Work and careers roundup from ft.com/work-careers</strong></p> <p>An MBA graduate is moving back to London and is unable to find a job after working overseas for two decades. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b68dcfab-8dba-4a32-a1fb-b0479dbee451\">Do you have any advice</a>?</p> <p>Return to the office: More than 1,000 readers shared their concerns and hopes on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5b9af97-3193-4dd6-bcb8-894ba7846e0e\">heading back to the workplace</a>.
