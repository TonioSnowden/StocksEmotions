  "title": "Gym Chain  Equinox Gets  New Loans  ----  By Alexander Saeedy and Alexander Gladstone",
  "text": "<p>   Equinox Group LLC has obtained $255 million in new financing commitments from some of its lenders and owners, as the cash-strapped gym chain seeks to bolster its liquidity, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   The lenders extending new financing include Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., these people said. Executives at property developer RelatedCos. who own a stake in Equinox are also providing funds, according to the people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   Beyond adding cash to the balance sheet, Equinox aims for the financing to serve as a bridge as it explores a potential transaction with a special-purpose acquisition company, they said. </p><p>   Bank of America agreed to provide a $74 million term loan that will pay off the outstanding balance of an existing revolving credit facility, the people said, while a consortium of banks provided a new $76 million revolving line of credit for the company. </p><p></p>",
