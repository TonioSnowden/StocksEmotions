  "title": "Intel Eyes Significantly Lower Valuation in IPO of Mobileye Unit; A target valuation of under $20 billion is expected, down from $50 billion",
  "text": "<p>In another sign of the challenges facing the offering, Mobileye plans to launch its roadshow for prospective investors on Tuesday, a day later than anticipated.</p><p>Intel last month filed publicly for an IPO of Mobileye and is expected to detail its new valuation expectations Tuesday. The goal is still for the shares to begin trading Oct. 26, the people said.</p><p>The deal is a test of the beleaguered IPO market, which has been hit hard by rising inflation and interest rates, fears of a recession and plummeting stock prices, especially for Mobileye's technology-company peers.</p><p>The U.S. IPO market is having one of its worst years on record, with traditional offerings on track to raise the least money since at least 1995, according to Dealogic. Major U.S. indexes are all in bear markets, defined in Wall Street parlance as a decline of 20% or more from a recent high. Also deterring new listings: The majority of companies that went public in 2020 and 2021 are trading below their IPO prices, many far below.</p><p>Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger has said that listing Mobileye would give the self-driving car unit a higher profile and attract more business. He has also said Intel doesn't need the money Mobileye's IPO would generate.</p><p>Intel will retain a large stake in Mobileye, including all of the Class B shares Mobileye plans to issue, it has disclosed. Each Class B share will have voting rights equivalent to 10 Class A shares.</p><p>Mobileye had $854 million in revenue for the first six months of its fiscal year, up 21% from the year-earlier period. The company had a net loss of $67 million.</p><p>It is the second IPO in less than a decade for Mobileye, which first went public in 2014 at a roughly $5 billion valuation. Intel acquired the Israeli company in 2017 for $15.3 billion.</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are leading the offering.</p><p>Write to Corrie Driebusch at corrie.driebusch@dowjones.com</p><p>Intel Eyes Significantly Lower Valuation in IPO of Mobileye Unit</p>",
