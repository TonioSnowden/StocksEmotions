  "title": "Citigroup's Jane Fraser Gets $22.5 Million for First Year as CEO; She took over as CEO in early 2021, the first woman to lead a major Wall Street bank",
  "text": "<p>Citigroup paid Ms. Fraser's predecessor, Michael Corbat, $19.04 million in 2020. Mr. Corbat took a 21% pay cut that year after regulators reprimanded the bank and fined it $400 million for failing to improve its risk-management systems. He made $24 million in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>In 2020, as president of the bank and head of its consumer operations, Ms. Fraser made $17.15 million, with a $500,000 salary.</p><p>In her first year as CEO, Ms. Fraser quickly set to work on a strategic refresh, announcing plans to shed consumer banking assets around the globe to focus the bank more tightly around a few core consumer offerings and its global corporate banking services. She has had to juggle that work with the expensive and time-consuming internal transformations needed to appease regulators.</p><p>Investors are waiting for proof of her plan's success. Citigroup shares fell 2% in 2021, and the stock stands alone among its biggest peers in trading at a discount to its book value. The stock is up less than 1% since Ms. Fraser took over as CEO. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is up 23%.</p><p>Ms. Fraser's 2021 pay came in well below other big bank CEOs, who were richly compensated for a banner year on Wall Street.</p><p>Morgan Stanley's James Gorman and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s David Solomon each earned $35 million in 2021. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s Jamie Dimon made $34.5 million, while Bank of America Corp.'s Brian Moynihan was paid $32 million.</p><p>Citigroup has been pushing banks to disclose payment metrics that show gaps between men and women. In 2020, the bank said that the median pay for women globally at Citigroup was 74% of the pay for men. When adjusted for titles and experience, Citi said women make 99% of their male counterparts. The bank has said its working on reducing the raw difference by increasing the amount of women in higher-paying and more senior roles.</p><p>Ms. Fraser's ascent to the top of the bank has been hailed across Wall Street as an long-overdue sign of progress for women in the industry. In September, at an event for the Women's Bond Club, Ms. Fraser said there is still work to do.</p><p>\"It takes a child's bewilderment to demonstrate how absurd it is that a woman's work would not be valued as much as a man's,\" she said.</p><p>What big bank ceos made last year</p><p>* Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman Gets $35 Million for 2021</p><p>* JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Gets $3 Million Raise to $34.5 Million for 2021</p><p>* Goldman Doubles CEO David Solomon's 2021 Pay to $35 Million</p><p>* BofA Lifts CEO Brian Moynihan's Pay 31% for 2021 to $32 Million</p><p>Write to David Benoit at David.Benoit@wsj.com</p><p>Citigroup's Jane Fraser Gets $22.5 Million for First Year as CEO</p>",
