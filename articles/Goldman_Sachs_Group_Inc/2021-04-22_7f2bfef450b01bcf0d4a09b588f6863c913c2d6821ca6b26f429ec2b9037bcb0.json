  "text": "<p>Should win: \"Nomadland\"</p><p>Will win: \"Nomadland\"</p><p>Well, that assertion of certainty feels good. But not as good as Chloe Zhao's film made me feel about the state of filmmaking, the power of kindness, the majesty of Western landscapes, the decency of people inhabiting them, the wonder of Frances McDormand (more about her in a moment) and the mysterious nature of art -- how to explain a quintessentially American film having been made by a filmmaker who was born and raised in Beijing? But \"Nomadland\" doesn't need explanations. It's a work of art that goes with the mainstream flow, available in its tenderness and nuance to anyone who chooses to watch it.</p><p>BEST DIRECTOR</p><p>Should win: Chloe Zhao (\"Nomadland\")</p><p>Will win: Chloe Zhao</p><p>Hmm, this could get pleasantly boring. But how could she lose, famous last words and Goldman's wisdom notwithstanding? That is to say, how could any sentient member of the Motion Picture Academy not recognize the presence of a filmmaker who managed to put her stamp on every scene -- the sharp eye, gentle rhythms, rueful tone -- yet come up with a film that seems to have directed itself? She did much of the same thing, of course, in 2017 in her previous feature, \"The Rider.\" All the more reason to give her the Oscar she didn't get then.</p><p>BEST ACTOR</p><p>Should win: Chadwick Boseman (\"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\")</p><p>Will win: Gary Oldman (\"Mank\")</p><p>I really hope I'm wrong. Not because Mr. Oldman's performance in \"Mank\" is less than exemplary. He's always good: I can still hear him playing George Smiley in \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" as clearly as if I'd switched on a radio. But Chadwick Boseman's work in \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom\" has two distinctions. First, Boseman was gravely ill during production, and died shortly afterward; how did he find the energy to do what he did? Second, what he did is flat-out brilliant, a portrait of a hothead cornetist with a reservoir of rage that has nowhere to go until he finds the worst possible place for it.</p><p>BEST ACTRESS</p><p>Should win: Frances McDormand (\"Nomadland\")</p><p>Will win: Frances McDormand</p><p>No more jokes about predictability -- or inevitability. In my review I called \"Nomadland\" a modest masterpiece. Frances McDormand's presence in it is a modest triumph. She lets Fern speak for herself. This may sound silly -- Fern is her and she is nomadic, laconic and fatalistic Fern -- but that's the point. They are intertwined so inextricably that there's no performance as such, only the exquisitely rueful yet improbably hopeful presence that this remarkable actress brings to her role. She is the film's soul, and Fern takes her place in the ranks of unforgettable heroines.</p><p>BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR</p><p>Should win: Daniel Kaluuya and/or LaKeith Stanfield (\"Judas and the Black Messiah\")</p><p>Will win: Sacha Baron Cohen (\"The Trial of the Chicago 7\")</p><p>No sure thing here, far from it, but my thinking is fairly obvious. Messrs. Kaluuya and Stanfield are absolute equals in the power and virtuosity of their contributions to \"Judas and the Black Messiah.\" They've ended up in the supporting category only because the film, constructed for an ensemble, has no single starring role. With them splitting the vote, therefore, Mr. Cohen might walk off with the trophy, which would be perfectly fine. In \"The Trial Of the Chicago 7,\" a production that takes on more history than it can handle, he makes the incendiary Yippie Abbie Hoffman the film's most intriguing character.</p><p>BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS</p><p>Should win: Yuh-jung Youn (\"Minari\")</p><p>Could win: Maria Bakalova (\"Borat\")</p><p>Will win: Yuh-jung Youn</p><p>A complicated category, so I've complicated it a bit more with a third speculation. If Ms. Bakalova wins, it will be because she brings such an electrifying jolt of exuberance to Sacha Baron Cohen's occasionally inspired but sporadically sputtering new vehicle for his Borat character. All the same, Ms. Youn makes the grandma in \"Minari\" one of a kind, and a wonderfully screwy kind, a foul-mouthed card player and gleefully incompetent cook who will, of course, win the heart of the little boy who deplores her, and our hearts too.</p>",
