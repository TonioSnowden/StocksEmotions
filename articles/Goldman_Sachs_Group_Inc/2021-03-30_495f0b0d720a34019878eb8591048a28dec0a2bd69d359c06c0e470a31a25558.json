  "title": "Monday's Markets:  Banking Shares Drive Down S&P 500  ---  Investors show  concern about losses  tied to fund unloading  billions in holdings  ----  By Anna Hirtenstein and Akane Otani",
  "text": "<p>   The S&amp;P 500 retreated from a record, pressured by declines in shares of banks and technology stocks. </p><p>   Financial stocks led declines after a large investment fund last week unwound billions of dollars in holdings, triggering concern that global banks that dealt with the firm could face sharp losses. </p><p>   Credit Suisse Group and Nomura Holdings said Monday that they could incur substantial losses from dealings with a U.S. client. Neither bank named its respective client, but people familiar with the matter have identified the fund as former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang's Archegos Capital Management, which sold $30 billion in holdings last week. </p><p>   \"We don't know yet the prime reason why this hedge fund had to liquidate,\" said Luc Filip, head of investments at SYZ Private Banking. \"It adds to the unsettling things happening in the market.\" </p><p>   The contagion effect may be limited, and any volatility in markets could be fleeting, he added. </p><p>   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.49 points, or 0.3%, to 33171.37, erasing losses after starting the trading session lower. The S&amp;P 500 lost 3.45 points, or 0.1%, to 3971.09, paring losses from earlier in the session, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 79.08 points, or 0.6%, to 13059.65. </p><p>   Shares in some global banks fell as investors grew worried that more financial intermediaries may struggle to recoup money lent to this client. </p><p>   Morgan Stanley dropped $2.10, or 2.6%, to $77.88 and Goldman Sachs fell $1.66, or 0.5%, to $325.73. </p><p>   Outside the U.S., shares of Japanese bank Nomura fell 16%. In Europe, Credit Suisse dropped 14% and Deutsche Bank lost 3.3%. </p><p>   \"There is widespread selling because there is uncertainty about who's involved,\" and which banks may be hit, said Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. \"It is fear specific to this, specific volatility around that circumstance.\" </p><p>   Shares of ViacomCBS and Discovery, which were among the stocks subject to big block sales last week, continued falling as well. ViacomCBS fell $3.22, or 6.7%, to $45.01 and Discovery dropped 67 cents, or 1.6%, to $41.23. </p><p>   Companies thought to benefit from people working from home because of the pandemic also retreated, with Peloton Interactive falling $1.40, or 1.3%, to $105.02 and Teladoc Health falling $5.59, or 3.2%, to $171.30. </p><p>   Such stocks surged in the fall, but their gains have been tempered in recent months as investors have tilted toward sectors poised to benefit the most from the economy reopening. </p><p>   Trading could remain volatile in the first half of the week as fund managers adjust their positions at the end of the first quarter, investors said. Despite Monday's pullback, major U.S. stock indexes remain on course to post gains for the quarter. </p><p>   \"There has been a good performance of equities, so you could see some people taking profit,\" said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Solutions. \"I'm definitely part of the buy-the-dip camp.\" </p><p>   Bond yields have largely stabilized following a number of weeks in which their sharp uptick put pressure on equity markets, and particularly growth stocks. </p><p>   The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield edged up to 1.721% from 1.658% on Friday. Bond yields rise as prices fall. </p><p>   Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged up 0.2%. </p><p>   Early Tuesday, Japan's Nikkei was down less than 0.1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was up 1% and South Korea's Kospi was up 1.3%. U.S. stock futures were unchanged. </p><p></p>",
