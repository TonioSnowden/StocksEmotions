  "text": "<p>Jake Freeman cashing out his position in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond contradicts the idea that the mania for pandemic-era meme stocks is over (“How a 20-year-old student made $110mn riding the meme stock wave”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b83144bd-830e-4e1d-a9a1-a1ee1ba61dab\">Report</a>, August 23). </p> <p>Issues around manipulation apart, the story underlines the simple fact that this new breed of semi-professional individual investor is the biggest area of growth in markets today.</p> <p>Goldman Sachs says for every $100 put in stock market mutual funds and exchange traded funds over the 74 weeks to May 2022, only $2 was redeemed. Most of this has been retail investing, not institutional money — which has exited in droves.</p> <p>The World Economic Forum says that three out of four retail investors would invest more if they had better opportunities to learn about investing.</p> <p>Individuals can't easily access institutional information and insights served by the large incumbent data providers, nor access sell-side research which has in any case declined because of regulation and cost. They use a variety of channels to make their decisions, including financial news media and social media.</p> <p>They've also come to rely on the “creator economy” such as software platforms like YouTube, TikTok and Instagram. Stripe estimates 50 platforms could be supporting more than 15.5mn creators in five years' time, including those focused on business and finance. </p> <p>Despite the down cycle, many retail investors — especially the younger ones — report greater confidence in their own skills, despite the challenges of the market, and are reading more to help their investment theses. </p> <p>With increasing opportunities for experts and commentators to share their insights, the democratisation of investment research is here to stay.</p> <p><strong>Duncan Wales</strong> <br><em>Founder and Chief Executive, Scriber London SE1, UK</em> </p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this letter</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a793d60a-f09c-4755-9c6e-09b7956c91de\"><em>Can meme mania survive higher rates environment?</em></a><em>&#xa0;/</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a793d60a-f09c-4755-9c6e-09b7956c91de\"><em>From Stephen Butcher, Hambleton, Rutland, UK</em></a></p><p>Source:  2022 'Letter: Some data points on meme stock mania' FT.com 1 September.
