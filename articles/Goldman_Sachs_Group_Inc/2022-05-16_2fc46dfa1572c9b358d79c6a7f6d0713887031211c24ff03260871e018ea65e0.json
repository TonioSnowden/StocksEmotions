Real assets, such as infrastructure investments, offer an opportunity for diversification and can potentially provide attractive real yield and predictable cash flows, while serving as a natural inflation hedge.</p><p>Earlier Monday, fresh economic data from China appeared to trigger some investor jitters, as that country revealed continued fallout from recent COVID lockdowns.</p><p>The data complicates an already cloudy picture for U.S. investors, experiencing a bear market for tech stocks and close to one for the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>See: Despite bounce, S&amp;P 500 hovers close to bear market.
