  "title": "Archegos's Word Was Good Enough for Wall Street's Top Banks; Indictment of Bill Hwang, the family office's founder, reveals a costly blind spot for banks that lend money to rich people and institutions",
  "text": "<p>Prosecutors say Bill Hwang and his employees routinely misled eight banks that traded with the firm or lent it money to investâ€”a group that included Wall Street heavyweights Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG. The Archegos executives, prosecutors allege, lied about the size of the firm's positions, the makeup of its portfolio and the amount of cash it had, convincing the banks until the very end they were safe.</p><p>The indictments lay out a pattern of bankers asking questions about billions of dollars in risk and accepting answers without proof. Because Archegos traded in swaps and derivatives that don't require full disclosure, the banks were largely blind to Archegos's dealings with the others.</p><p>Still, banks continued to feed Mr. Hwang a longer rope based on assurances that Archegos was on solid ground. Before its collapse last year, banks lent Archegos enough money to increase the value of its investments to more than $160 billion on just $36 billion in capital.</p><p>Lawyers for Mr. Hwang and Patrick Halligan, Archegos's chief financial officer, denied the allegations Wednesday.</p><p>The episode reveals a costly blind spot for a business that is obsessed with minimizing risk.</p><p>Banks won't give consumers so much as a credit card without first reviewing a detailed borrowing history. Rich people and institutions borrowing against their holdings play by another set of rules. Banks' misplaced trust in Archegos cost them around $10 billion all told; Credit Suisse Group AG alone suffered $5.5 billion in losses.</p><p>Prosecutors' narrative is likely to raise more concerns about whether there arehidden risks lurking in the lucrative business of securities lending, which has soared in recent years. There was about $800 billion in outstanding margin debt in March, compared with $480 billion two years earlier, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.</p><p>The Federal Reserve in December warned banks they shouldn't rely on client assurances when making lending decisions. U.S. lawmakers have interrogated bank officials and regulators about how Archegos was able to borrow so much money. And the SEC has proposed new disclosure rules that would have forced Archegos's trades into the open.</p><p>Wall Street has collected large sums in recent years by helping investors buy stocks and borrow money to do so. Credit Suisse disclosed that it made about $16 million in revenue off Archegos in 2020 and stood to make $40 million in 2021, until the fund imploded.</p><p>After Morgan Stanley disclosed a $911 million loss on Archegos last year, Chief Executive James Gorman called its prime brokerage a \"backbone of its equities business.\" The unit, he said, had generated about $40 billion in revenue over the prior decade. He said the bank would more closely scrutinize its relationships with family offices and hedge funds going forward.</p><p>Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley representatives declined to comment.</p><p>Prosecutors said Archegos fed banks a steady stream of lies about its positions and risk. The banks largely believed them, court documents show.</p><p>In November 2020, prosecutors said, Morgan Stanley asked Archegos to transfer some of its exposure in Gaotu Techedu Inc., a Chinese education firm, to another counterparty and replace it with more liquid holdings in stocks like Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. Archegos's head trader demurred, court papers said. The firm was maxed out at other banks with Gaotu Techedu, and the positions in Amazon and Apple didn't exist, prosecutors said.</p><p>In February and March 2021, UBS twice increased its trading limit with Archegos based on its assurances, including on false information about how much of the firm's capital it had invested in its 10 largest holdings, according to court papers.</p><p>As Archegos's stock bets imploded in late March 2021, Archegos managed to persuade one more bank to do its bidding, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a separate complaint filed Wednesday.</p><p>Archegos asked the unnamed bank to send it $248 million on the afternoon of March 24 for portfolio-rebalancing purposes, the SEC said. The bank owed Archegos the money from some trades that were going well, but a credit executive questioned why it wanted the money, warning the bank was likely going to need margin for other trades the next day, the SEC said. Archegos, the SEC said, told the bank it wasn't in a \"distressed situation\" and had some $9 billion in cash.</p><p>Archegos used the money to meet margin calls from other banks, the SEC said.</p><p>Archegos's Word Was Good Enough for Wall Street's Top Banks</p>",
