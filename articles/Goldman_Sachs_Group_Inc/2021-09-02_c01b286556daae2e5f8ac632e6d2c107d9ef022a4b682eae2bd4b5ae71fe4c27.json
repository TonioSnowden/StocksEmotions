The report says a shortage of bank reserves was indeed an issue then. The report also points to another reason for the upward pressure in short-term rates: \"Intermediation costs for some large domestic dealers likely rose due to a temporary reduction in lending from money market mutual funds, including through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation 's sponsored repo program, leading dealers to charge higher spreads to ultimate cash borrowers.\"</p><p>â€”Michael S.

The ISM Manufacturing Report on Business PMI rose to 59.9 in August from 59.5 in July, according to data from the Institute for Supply Management released Wednesday. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected the index to come in at 58.6. (Dow Jones Newswires)</p><p>China's State Council said it will increase the central bank's relending quota by 300 billion yuan ($46.4 billion) this year to support struggling small businesses and keep economic growth within a reasonable range.</p><p>The Bank of England named the former chief European economist at Goldman Sachs, Huw Pill, as its chief economist. He replaces Andy Haldane , who left over the summer, and as chief economist Mr. Pill will vote on the interest-rate setting Monetary Policy Committee. He most recently was a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School and has held senior roles at the European Central Bank . (DJN)</p><p>The jobless rate in the eurozone continued to decline in July, as the reopening after the easing of pandemic-related restrictions fueled a strong economic recovery over summer. The rate fell from a revised 7.8% in June to 7.6%, Eurostat data showed. The reading matches forecasts from economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. (DJN)</p><p>Eurozone manufacturing activity held up in August and seems to have grown at a solid pace, albeit losing some momentum amid supplier shortages and inflation pressures, as the final reading for the eurozone's manufacturing PMI for the month came in at 61.4, a six-month low, data from IHS Markit showed. This was down from 62.8 in July and marginally below the 61.5 preliminary estimate. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while below this threshold signals a contraction. (DJN)</p><p>Italy's unemployment rate continued to decline in July, edging down from a downwardly revised 9.4% in June to 9.3%, the lowest level since May 2020, as the country's economic recovery gathered momentum in the summer, data from statistics office Istat showed. (DJN)</p><p>U.S. nonfarm private employment increased by 374,000 in August, data from ADP National Employment Report showed Wednesday, missing the 600,000 rise expected by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal. (DJN)</p><p>U.S. construction spending rose 0.3% on month in July after stagnating the previous month, according to the Commerce Department. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal expected a 0.2% rise. (DJN)</p><p>Brazil's economy contracted slightly in the second quarter from the previous three months as industrial activity shrank due to supply problems and agriculture was hit by a decline in the coffee harvest. Gross domestic product shrank a seasonally adjusted 0.1% from the first quarter and rose 12.4% from a year earlier, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics said. In the first quarter, GDP grew by 1.2% from the previous three months and 1.0% from a year earlier. (DJN)</p><p>Brazil's trade surplus widened from $7.4 billion in July to $7.7 billion in August as exports increased more than imports, according to the economy ministry. (DJN)</p><p>Remittances to Mexico rose to a record $4.54 billion in July, up 29% from a year earlier and 3.9% higher than in June in seasonally adjusted terms, the Bank of Mexico said. July marked a fifth consecutive month above $4 billion and brought the total for the January-July period to $28.19 billion, a 24% increase from the first seven months of 2020. (DJN)</p>",
