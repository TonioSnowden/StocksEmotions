  "text": "<p>Beijing's market regulator has called for closer communication with Washington in a bid to ease tensions after the US tightened controls on Chinese companies listing shares on Wall Street.</p> <p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1d0dcb2a-ebff-49f1-bfb8-ae72251cbe61\">on Friday</a> that Chinese groups would be subject to stricter disclosures over their structures and state ties before being allowed to list shares in the US.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.csrc.gov.cn/pub/csrc_en/newsfacts/release/202108/t20210801_402627.html\">a statement</a> on Sunday, the China Securities Regulatory Commission noted the SEC's move and said the two sides would “continue to enhance communication with the principle of mutual respect and co-operation”. It also stressed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3d30930-b098-40f0-a628-448c0b532b6d\">Beijing's efforts</a> to improve the transparency and predictability of its policies, promising to “engage closely” with investors, companies and authorities.</p> <p>“The CSRC has always been open to companies' choices to list their securities on international or domestic markets in compliance with relevant laws and regulations,” it said.</p> <p>Investors are bracing for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1282e529-ee65-4a8d-9190-c7d1eb70b8d5\">prolonged uncertainty</a> in a snowballing regulatory crackdown in the world's second-biggest economy that threatens to embroil the country's most prominent tech groups. </p> <p>US concerns were heightened in July after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/095eb7ac-09ea-4a5c-8253-d8ca2d945614\">Chinese officials launched a data security investigation</a>&#xa0;into Didi Chuxing, China's biggest ride-hailing app, days after the company's $4.4bn New York initial public offering. </p> <p>The CSRC statement comes after it privately <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3d30930-b098-40f0-a628-448c0b532b6d\">sought to ease</a> international investor worries, telling a group of Wall Street banks and global investors that its crackdown on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db7004d1-b5ad-436b-b5c4-f5faed2e1c84\">tutoring sector</a> was an isolated event.</p> <p>But foreign investors remain concerned about this and other risks to Chinese tech groups.</p> <p>Among the companies already in the regulator's crosshairs are billionaire Jack Ma's fintech Ant Group, the $100bn&#xa0;tutoring industry as well as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f958def-6657-4283-8998-2954909a3465\">Tencent</a>, owner of the massive WeChat social app. Delivery platform Meituan and Ma's ecommerce business Alibaba have been subject to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cd3834b5-a3f3-40e5-82db-7552ef35640e\">antitrust investigations</a>.</p> <p>“Chinese authorities are taking measures to promote orderly development of certain industries,” the CSRC said on Sunday. “The purpose of these measures is to balance development with security and enhance sustainable development of market entities.”</p> <p>Beijing on Friday promised <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cb3c0ee7-2ddb-48d2-8b58-9700dfbaadbd\">stronger controls</a> for Chinese companies selling shares overseas, following a top-level meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping.</p> <p>China's central bank has urged further “rectification” of the country's fintech sector, adding more pressure on tech groups, according to a statement released on Saturday.</p> <p>The People's Bank of&#xa0;China called for fintech companies to improve competition and consumer rights as it signalled stricter oversight on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b9f6c876-22bb-498c-a425-78287455a3e1\">illegal cryptocurrency activities</a> while also forging ahead with its own efforts to develop a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7511809e-827e-4526-81ad-ae83f405f623\">digital renminbi</a>. The latest warning from the PBoC did not name any companies.</p> <p>The clampdown on China's huge tech sector comes as the country faces an uneven economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>An important gauge of manufacturing industry health in China reflected a worse than expected slowdown in July. </p> <p>China's official purchasing managers' index fell to 50.4 last month down from 50.9 in June, reflecting rising inflationary pressures, shrinking export growth and the effect of extreme flooding in parts of the country.</p> <p>While the index was above the 50 point marker separating expansion from contraction, July marked the weakest reading since February 2020, when China was hit by sweeping lockdown measures. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs analysts, who had forecast growth of 50.7, noted that China's new export order sub-index fell to 47.7 in July from 48.1 in the previous month, the lowest since June last year.</p> <p>The deceleration in Chinese factory activity followed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/484f019c-8179-49d9-b23a-2885b8aeaf47\">Beijing's warnings</a> of an unbalanced economic recovery when it reported quarter-on-quarter GDP growth of 1.3 per cent for the three months to June.</p> <p>Complicating China's outlook is a coronavirus outbreak that has broadened from Nanjing, the provincial capital of eastern province Jiangsu, with locally transmitted cases reported across seven other provinces. China's National Health Commission said in its latest update that there were 53 new locally transmitted cases.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Sun Yu in Beijing </em></p><p>Source: Edward White in Seoul 2021 'China calls for closer communication with US over stock market controls' FT.com 1 August.
