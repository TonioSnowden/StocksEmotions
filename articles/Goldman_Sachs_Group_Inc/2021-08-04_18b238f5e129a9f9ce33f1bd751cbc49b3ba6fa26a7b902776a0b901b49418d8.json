  "text": "<h2>The local pension funds and the Israeli spyware maker&#xa0;</h2> <p>One nice thing about running a private equity firm is that, no matter how inadvisable your actions may be, it's unbelievably difficult to put yourself out of business.</p> <p>You can:&#xa0;</p> <ul>  <li><p>Have funds that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/172cc02c-62a0-11e9-a27a-fdd51850994c?emailId=6101cc544a2b5000040c5256&amp;segmentId=69ce8bbf-afc9-7c01-fb70-6e4448aa1f37\">lose investors' money</a>.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdb7f2fe-7589-457e-8c5d-e5f515c557da\">Buy a stake</a> in <strong>Greensill Capital </strong>and then <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6955091f-4339-4f1b-b4d7-92d2ef05d4c6\">borrow money</a> from it.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f2b79a28-889c-4ff1-86cf-53dc96454d76\">Supervise expenses claims</a> in such a way that a senior partner receives hundreds of thousands of dollars from investors for personal expenses including a friend's bachelor party and a trip to the Super Bowl.</p></li>  <li><p>Own an Israeli spyware firm that gets sued by one of the world's biggest tech firms after its malware was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab\">allegedly deployed</a> using <strong>WhatsApp</strong>.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <p>What a private equity firm can't survive, it seems, is a catastrophic falling-out among its most senior executives that is so bad it leads investors to conclude they are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d88518dd-7c66-48b2-b3e5-c765ebe720ab\">no longer capable</a> of controlling the fund together.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's what happened at <strong>Novalpina Capital</strong>, whose investors — known as limited partners — last month took the incredibly rare step of terminating Novalpina's control of its €1bn fund.&#xa0;</p> <p>Now the LPs have lined up the US consultancy <strong>Berkeley Research Group</strong> to take Novalpina's place, DD's Kaye Wiggins and the FT's Anna Gross <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d78b4300-4f49-413b-8c22-f32b99343a21\">report</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>BRG's mandate, if its appointment is approved in a vote this week, will be to wind up the fund and return cash to investors.&#xa0;</p> <p>That means selling the three companies it owns: the Estonian gambling company <strong>Olympic Entertainment Group</strong>, the French pharmaceutical business <strong>Laboratoire X.O</strong> . . . and the Israel-based surveillance company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9127eae-f99d-11e9-98fd-4d6c20050229\"><strong>NSO Group</strong></a>.</p> <p>The latter company faces a lawsuit from <strong>Facebook</strong> over allegations that WhatsApp was used to send malware to more than 1,000 customers. Separately, a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2f5feb53-e7ff-47b3-ad42-93a8f2bc6aac\">report</a> said last month that NSO's software was used to target the phones of journalists and activists.&#xa0;</p> <p>NSO has disputed Facebook's allegations, and described last month's report as “full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories”.</p> <p>To say that's a challenging sale process is something of an understatement.</p> <p>The Novalpina episode highlights the role of limited partners — typically pension funds, insurance funds and sovereign wealth funds — which pour money into private equity's coffers.&#xa0;</p> <p>These groups, often public bodies that control the flows of billions of dollars, typically see themselves as being a step removed from the decisions that private equity firms make about what to do with their cash.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Will this reminder of their ultimate responsibility make them think differently about their funds? DD would love to hear from LPs with thoughts on the matter.

The Wall Street bank raked in record revenue from asset management in the past quarter thanks to a nifty trick: investing its own capital.</p> <p>Goldman's so-called balance sheet investments, which have shuffled around different divisions at the bank over the years, sprouted while it operated as a partnership prior to its initial public offering in 1999. Goldman would use its own capital and funds from its partners to make investments.</p> <p>This was an amalgamation of the private equity-style dealmaking the bank is still doing, in addition to “proprietary trading” of stocks and bonds — a practice since outlawed by the Volcker rule, part of the Dodd-Frank package of post-financial crisis banking reforms.</p> <p>These equity investments provided $3.7bn in revenues for Goldman in the second quarter of this year, which the bank described as an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94e26c0f-4fd3-4d31-a624-8e6ec35ce0ae\">all-time high</a>. Its performance drove record total revenue of $5.1bn at its asset management division, helping the bank to beat analysts' estimates and surpassing the money flowing in from its formidable investment banking and trading divisions.</p> <p>But rather than expand this lucrative line of business, Goldman is now seeking to shrink it, the FT's Josh Franklin <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fb175d7-fcf2-4d82-be0a-62ec49b6ab27\">reports</a>.</p> <p>The strategy is intended to please regulators and investors, both of which view the bank's equity investments as risky and unpredictable. As outlined during last year's investor day, Goldman plans to reduce its equity investments portfolio from $22bn to $18bn in the next five years.</p> <p>Still, paring the business down to this in size is proving difficult as Goldman's investments soar in value. At the end of the second quarter, its equity portfolio rose 5 per cent to $21bn as $5.5bn of asset sales were offset by $5bn in appreciation on investments as well as $1.5bn in new investments.&#xa0;</p> <p>As put by <strong>Autonomous Research</strong> banks analyst <strong>Christian Bolu</strong>: “The biggest problem they have right now is the gains are so big they're unable to shrink the portfolio.”</p> <h2>Credit Suisse's scandal spin-cycle spirals on</h2> <p>Just as <strong>Credit Suisse</strong> wrestles with the dual crises of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/226ce0d8-f076-4bc7-a6ec-dee429b0909e\"><strong>Archegos</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/542e84a5-caed-4b8e-bcd7-63051ae65ce1\"><strong>Greensill Capital</strong></a>, another scandal has come back to haunt the Swiss bank.</p> <p>It will face a trial over its role in Mozambique's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/809c1c52-3b62-11e9-b72b-2c7f526ca5d0\">$2bn “tuna bonds”</a> scandal, people familiar with the matter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf3bf78c-46ff-44bb-8767-d5abfda21b9b\">told</a> the FT's Owen Walker and Stephen Morris. Creditors, who brought the lawsuit, and Credit Suisse, will meet in court in September 2023 for a 13-week trial.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The re-emergence of the eight-year-old scandal is another smudge on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47471301-2898-4144-9882-475dcf4030ab\">“clean slate”</a> proposed by chief executive <strong>Thomas Gottstein</strong> at the end of last year, already sullied by the aforementioned twin scandals (<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-posts-78-q2-net-profit-decline-2021-07-29/\">delivering blows</a> to its second-quarter earnings), and a whole other <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a6be4fc-5102-4bd2-9bf3-f27dd9957c6f\">laundry list</a> of fiascos.</p> <p>A quick refresher: in 2013 Credit Suisse helped arrange $2bn of loans and bond issues from international investors to allegedly help Mozambique fund infrastructure projects. Auditors later discovered that $500m of the money raised by the loans could not be accounted for. They also found that the companies who had borrowed the money paid over the odds for equipment and $200m of the loans were used for bank fees.</p> <p>The bank faces “serious claims . . . of fraud and conspiracy, with multimillion [dollar] damages claimed”, a person close to the case told the FT. The bank declined to comment.&#xa0;</p> <p>The creditors are represented by the US law firm <strong>Boies Schiller Flexner</strong>, which also happens to be putting together a class-action lawsuit against Credit Suisse on behalf of investors in the Greensill funds.</p> <p>Credit Suisse, which is scrambling to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/918bb064-1ea7-4cbf-91c5-081481376cb0\">retain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/674d3e2e-bff2-4cab-9198-e29f11a6dd70\">rehire</a> its staff, might also want to make sure the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ed1bc85-2fd0-4f8e-acec-4b35494dbc67\">golden handcuffs</a> of its top attorneys remain firmly in place.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>J Allen Brack</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b3aa83d4-4c00-40b3-ae53-d9c9bed5a361\">stepping down</a> as president of <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong> after allegations of workplace misconduct resulted in protests against the gaming group.
