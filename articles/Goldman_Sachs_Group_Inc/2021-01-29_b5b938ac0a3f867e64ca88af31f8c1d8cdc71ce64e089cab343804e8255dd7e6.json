  "text": "<p>If Washington is going to do it, now is the time. Some 100-year bonds have slightly higher rates (between 1 and 2 percentage points above comparable 10-year bond yields) and similar bid-ask spreads (a proxy for liquidity) compared with the 10-year bonds of comparable issuers. Some, including chief analyst with Dankse Bank Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, have argued that the U.S. Treasury could currently issue 50-year bonds at around the same yield as 30-year bonds at around 2%. But there's a serious risk rates could skyrocket in the future. Imagine what would happen if inflation takes off or the U.S. runs into solvency issues with its massive and growing debt. The Treasury could look back at this time wistfully, wishing it'd locked in low interest rates -- and significant savings -- when it had the chance.</p><p>The Trump administration tried to issue 50- and 100-year bonds but got pushback from the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee, a group of representatives from asset managers and Wall Street banks who advise the Treasury. The committee argued there wouldn't be enough demand.</p><p>But its analysis missed how many long-term Treasurys could be bought up by defined-benefit pension funds looking for assets that match the duration (interest-rate risk) of their liabilities (payouts to pensioners in the future). While historically the duration of a typical pension scheme is around 20 years and tends to fall in the range of 15 to 25 years, many young pension funds pay out after more than 30 years.</p><p>Many of these pension funds (along with some insurance companies) would like to buy very high duration government bonds above their liability average (in the area of 50 years or more) to balance out the low duration of corporate bonds (usually around six or seven years) in what's called a \"barbell strategy.\" The returns associated with corporate bonds are more attractive given their credit risk and particularly can help pension funds generate returns for their beneficiaries when government interest rates are near zero -- as they are now. But you also need long maturity bonds that match the interest rate risk profile of pension fund payouts due far out in the future.</p><p>Some pension funds balance out corporate bonds by using interest-rate derivatives to achieve high duration (in what are often called duration overlays), but most pension funds aren't allowed to trade derivatives.</p><p>This isn't entirely theoretical. The Mexican government issued 50-year dollar-denominated notes this month looking to lengthen its debt profile and the issuance was oversubscribed by more than three times. If a country that has historically seen currency crises every six years can issue debt at 50-year maturity, why can't the U.S.? Even Italy amid sovereign debt woes has also sold 50-year bonds in recent years.</p><p>The Biden administration looks eager to spend big on Covid relief and more. Issuing long-duration Treasurys would help give it the fiscal space it needs to do it.</p><p>---</p><p>Mr. Hartley is a visiting fellow at the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity and a former Goldman Sachs fixed-income risk manager.</p><p>(See related letter: \"Letters to the Editor: Long Bonds Won't Help Underfunded Plans\" -- WSJ Feb. 8, 2021)</p>",
