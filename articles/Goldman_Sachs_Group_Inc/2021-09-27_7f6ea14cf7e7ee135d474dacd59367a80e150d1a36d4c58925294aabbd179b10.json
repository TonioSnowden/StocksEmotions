Power shortages led to forced factory production cuts in China, while in the U.K., a shortage of truck drivers led to hoarding and declining inventories at gas stations.</p><p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs hiked their oil-price forecast to $90 a barrel, citing the impact of what it said was the most bullish hurricane in U.S. history on supply.</p><p>These energy disruptions highlight what's been a growing issue for the global economy, namely that supply has not recovered as fast as demand in a variety of markets. Costco Wholesale COST last week said it imposed limits on purchases of toilet paper and water.</p><p>Markets continued to cast a wary eye on the impact of China Evergrande's HK:3333 debt troubles on the world's number-two economy, while elections in Germany, the number-one European economy, have so far failed to produce a decisive results in what's expected to be months of coalition talks.</p><p>There are a number of Federal Reserve officials due to speak this week, with Monday including speeches from Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, New York Fed President John Williams and Fed Gov.
