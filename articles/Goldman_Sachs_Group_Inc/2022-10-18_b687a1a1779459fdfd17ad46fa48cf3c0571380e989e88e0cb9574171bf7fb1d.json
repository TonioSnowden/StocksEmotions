  "text": "<p>US stocks rose on Tuesday, extending gains from the previous session after Goldman Sachs became the latest bank to post better than expected quarterly results.</p> <p>The benchmark S&amp;P 500 index advanced 1.1 per cent while the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 0.9 per cent. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed up 0.3 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively.</p> <p>Those advances in equity markets followed a rally on Monday, with the S&amp;P 500 closing 2.6 per cent higher — supported by better than expected third-quarter results from Bank of America. BofA attributed its earnings to “resilient” US consumers.</p> <p>Investors have been monitoring the latest corporate financial statements for signs of strain from high inflation and rising borrowing costs. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve has led the charge this year on aggressively tightening monetary policy to curb rapid price growth — lifting interest rates by an extra-large 0.75 percentage points at each of its past three meetings to a target range of 3 to 3.25 per cent. Concerns have intensified in recent months that the Fed and its peers will turn the policy screws into a protracted slowdown.</p> <p>But the early stages of the latest US corporate earnings season have helped brighten sentiment. Shares in Goldman rose 2 per cent on Tuesday, after the bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cac2059d-4ead-4415-a7ef-74cdfc3c13d2\">reported third-quarter net income</a> of $3.1bn, down from $5.4bn a year earlier but above analysts' estimates of $2.9bn.</p> <p>The strong start to the week for equity markets was also boosted by the UK government's decision on Monday to ditch most of last month's “mini” Budget measures, which had spooked markets and sparked a fire-sale of pension fund assets.</p> <p>“The UK news has again seemed to heavily influence global markets over the last 24 hours after the UK government officially announced one of the biggest U-turns in political history and ditched the bulk of what remained of their mini-Budget,” wrote Jim Reid, a strategist at Deutsche Bank. </p> <p>Some analysts and investors consider recent stock market gains as temporary. A FTSE index of global shares has fallen 25 per cent this year, last month closing out its longest streak of quarterly losses since 2008.</p> <p>“Sentiment has been really depressed,” said Kasper Elmgreen, head of equities at Amundi, mentioning a BofA survey released on Tuesday that showed 72 per cent of fund managers anticipated a weaker economy in a year's time.</p> <p>Westminster's U-turn on its fiscal proposals, and BofA's results, had been positive for markets on Monday. But Elmgreen said: “We're not seeing much that gives us renewed, [long-term] confidence. It's natural that we have this bounce of optimism and strong days in a really challenging macro outlook.” </p> <p>He added: “We are entering what could be a quarter of reckoning: this may be the quarter where earnings have to give.”</p> <p>“Major central banks look likely to keep tightening rates until the first quarter of 2023, economic growth will likely continue to slow into the start of the new year, and global financial markets are vulnerable to stress while monetary policy continues to tighten,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.</p> <p>In government debt markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year UK gilt slipped 0.02 percentage points to 3.93 per cent as its price edged higher, following a rally in the previous session. The longer-dated 30-year yield dropped 0.02 percentage points to 4.29 per cent. In the US, the benchmark 10-year yield ticked 0.01 percentage point lower to 4 per cent.</p> <p>The pound edged down 0.2 per cent against the dollar to $1.132. Elsewhere, the yen traded at around ¥149 against the greenback, reaching a 32-year low.</p><p>Source: Ian Johnston in London and Kate Duguid in New York 2022 'US stocks rise after bank earnings' FT.com 18 October.
