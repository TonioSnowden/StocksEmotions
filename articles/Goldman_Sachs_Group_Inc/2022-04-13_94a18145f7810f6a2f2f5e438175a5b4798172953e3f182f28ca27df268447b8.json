  "text": "<p>By most indications, the second-largest grocery-chain operator -- behind Kroger -- exceeded Wall Street expectations. Its same-store sales grew 7.5% in the quarter ended Feb. 26 compared with a year earlier, much better than the 4.3% that analysts polled by FactSet expected. Kroger saw same-store sales grow 4% in its comparable quarter. Earnings of 79 cents a share were about 30% higher than analyst expectations.</p><p>Luckily for grocers, inflation isn't causing consumers to trade down yet, Albertsons Chief Executive Vivek Sankaran said on the earnings call on Tuesday. If anything, the share of organic sales has gone up, he noted. Albertsons tends to have higher pricing compared with its rivals, but it has been trying to add new price points through private-label goods. As of last quarter, its own brands accounted for more than a quarter of its sales.</p><p>Despite impressive results and guidance that either matched or exceeded Wall Street expectations, Albertsons shares declined 8.1% on Tuesday. Inflation could be weighing on investors' minds. In March, food-at-home prices soared 10% compared with a year earlier, higher than the 8.6% pace seen in February, according to data released by the Labor Department on Tuesday. That is uncomfortably high compared with the 3%-to-4% inflation rate, which Mr. Sankaran previously said was the company's sweet spot, where price increases can easily be passed onto the consumer.</p><p>Tuesday's share-price reaction only seems to bolster the company's push for a broad strategic review. In February, the company said it hired Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse to look at anything from tweaking its balance sheet, to changing its capital-return strategy to potential mergers and acquisitions. On the earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Sharon McCollam said the decision was driven by the fact that its valuation continued lagging peers despite stronger results, specifically pointing to Kroger. M&amp;A wouldn't be out of the question, especially given that Albertsons itself is a product of several acquisitions.</p><p>Albertsons did outpace Kroger's same-store sales in six out of the eight quarters since the company's public debut, and its net debt as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization is now in line with its larger peer. Yet its shares still trade at just 0.2 times expected forward-12-month sales, a discount compared with Kroger's 0.3 times and Ahold Delhaize's 0.4 times.</p><p>One real cloud hanging over Albertsons is the overhang from its convertible preferred shares on a relatively small stock float, something Ms. McCollam also pointed to during Tuesday's call. BMO Capital Markets' Kelly Bania estimates that if all of those shares were converted, the float would nearly double from today's 20%. Previous conversions have caused large stock-price reactions. The last conversion to trigger an 8-K filing on March 24 caused Albertsons shares to drop 8%.</p><p>Coming up with a solution that addresses its valuation and its capital structure won't be easy. As Ms. Bania from BMO notes, the small float could limit Albertsons' ability to buy back stock. Meanwhile, M&amp;A multiples for grocery chains haven't been all that appetizing in past years.</p><p>For example, a consortium led by Supervalu, CVS and Cerberus Capital in 2006 bought Albertsons at an enterprise value of 6.6 times trailing Ebitda, according to a UBS report. On that valuation measure, Albertsons fetches 7.4 times.</p><p>There is value in Albertsons shares for sure. But barring a bid from some white knight, shareholders may have no choice but to wait for the overhang from outstanding convertible preferred shares to clear.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
