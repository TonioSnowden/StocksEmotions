  "text": "<p>David Cameron pitched the services of supply-chain financing group Greensill Capital to a senior German government official just as an investigation into its German banking arm gathered pace.</p> <p>Cameron is at the centre of a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/806d73f9-182b-4922-ac9a-4028acefd33c\">lobbying scandal</a> over Greensill Capital, whose German subsidiary Greensill Bank fell into insolvency last month. </p> <p>A spokesman for the former UK prime minister told the Financial Times: “David Cameron participated on a virtual call with the German ambassador last November with senior representatives from Greensill to discuss introducing Earnd to the German civil service.”</p> <p>Earnd is a subsidiary of Greensill that allowed employees to draw down their salary in instalments. </p> <p>According to three people familiar with the matter, Cameron sought a meeting with German deputy finance minister Jörg Kukies last year. Kukies, a Social Democrat and former senior banker at Goldman Sachs, is in charge of financial market policy and European policy in Berlin. Kukies declined to take the meeting, the people said.</p> <p>However, a spokesman for Cameron disputed that he had solicited a meeting and said: “During [the embassy] call, the German ambassador offered a meeting for Greensill's team with German deputy finance minister,&#xa0;Jörg Kukies. That meeting did not take place and David Cameron had no role in suggesting it or the process of organising it.”</p> <p>The embassy call last November came after Germany's banking watchdog BaFin had stepped up its probe into Greensill's banking subsidiary. </p> <p>The bank's management is under <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/dd0735f9-3587-4d1c-977b-6554dfc4c019\">criminal investigation</a> after German regulators began probing it last year because of concerns over its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/44c47737-5d8b-4aca-8ff3-dbcc8349bc04\">exposure</a> to British steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta's businesses.</p> <p>Documents concerning Greensill that were released by the German finance ministry last month show that BaFin began “regular exchanges with foreign supervisory authorities” in January 2020, after press reports on “the business relationship between Greensill and the Gupta Group”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Over the summer the German regulator set up a “Greensill task force” to prepare a special audit of the bank after receiving tips from whistleblowers that pointed to “various allegations of fraud” around “falsified invoices”, the documents showed.&#xa0;</p> <p>This probe eventually raised concerns over the level of Greensill Bank's exposure to companies linked to metals magnate Gupta, who drew billions of euros of financing from the lender. KPMG, which kicked off the audit in September, also struggled to verify the existence of some invoices underpinning these financing arrangements, the FT has previously reported.</p> <p>Cameron started working as a paid adviser to the bank's parent company — Greensill Capital — in 2018, and was granted share options that at one point could have been worth tens of millions of pounds.</p> <p>He made his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/da2a2686-1efa-4fd4-bee4-79cc9d9a89a2\">first public statement</a> on Greensill last weekend, stating that he “played no role in the decisions to extend credit, or the terms on which such credit was extended”. He said the value of his share options, which are now worthless following the company's collapse, was “nowhere near the amount speculated in the press” but did not offer a specific figure.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/3b021684-5e03-4215-9c39-44aef5c3c848.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p>Kukies and the German finance ministry declined to comment. Greensill Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Greensill's administrator, Grant Thornton, declined to comment. The German foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Cameron's contacts with German officials have not previously been reported and are likely to add to the growing scrutiny of the former prime minister's conduct over the Greensill affair. </p> <p>Jens Zimmermann, an MP for the Social Democrats in Berlin who is on the Bundestag committee inquiring into the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/wirecard\">fraud at collapsed German payments company Wirecard</a>, said there were parallels “between the scandals around Wirecard and Greensill”. </p> <p>In both cases balance sheets appear to have been manipulated and “the massive use of former politicians as door openers is also evident”, said Zimmermann, who is deputy chair of the Bundestag's German-British Parliamentary Friendship Group.</p> <p>Kukies is facing criticism from his own coalition partners as well as the opposition for visiting Wirecard's then chief executive Markus Braun at the company's headquarters in Munich. The visit took place after the Financial Times had raised fraud allegations against Wirecard that triggered a special audit into its accounting.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The FT <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6ed619c0-bb9a-44dc-a2f6-c5596a958ca8\">first revealed</a> last month that Cameron lobbied the UK government to increase Greensill Capital's access to state-backed emergency Covid-19 loan schemes, months before the finance company collapsed and left the taxpayer on the hook for potential losses.</p> <p>Cameron is now set to be called to give evidence to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff89b4a2-627e-4e9d-9eed-7e0967d4c444\">multiple UK parliamentary inquiries</a> into the Greensill scandal.</p> <p>BaFin's criminal complaint against Greensill Bank's management is for suspected balance sheet manipulation, which can be punished with up to three years in jail under German law.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Guy Chazan in Berlin</em></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f300c54-b5c3-42c9-8d19-d3891ace83f0\"><em>Cameron's lobbying follows a familiar pattern</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4f300c54-b5c3-42c9-8d19-d3891ace83f0\"><em>From Barrie Bain, Wadhurst, East Sussex, UK</em></a></p><p>Source: Olaf Storbeck in Frankfurt and Robert Smith and Sebastian Payne in London 2021 'Cameron pitched Greensill's services to German government official' FT.com 16 April.
