  "text": "<p>In today's newsletter:</p> <ul>  <li><p>The deal that could keep Chinese companies listed in the US</p></li>  <li><p>Consulting firms open their wallets</p></li>  <li><p>Musk pulls the whistleblower card</p></li> </ul> <h1>US-listed Chinese companies got a lucky break. Is it too good to be true?</h1> <p>When China's <strong>Luckin Coffee</strong> defrauded its<strong> Nasdaq</strong> investors in a $300mn accounting scandal in 2020, the episode threatened to poison Wall Street's highly lucrative relations with Chinese companies. </p> <p>Shortly afterwards, the US introduced rules requiring US-listed foreign companies to make their audit work available for inspection every three years or face a trading ban. </p> <p>Fast-forward to today, and the policy is pivotal to the future financial ties between the two superpowers.</p> <p>China has blocked US regulators from accessing financial audit records and about 200 companies, including the tech giant <strong>Alibaba</strong>, could be delisted from New York stock exchanges unless the dispute is resolved. Alibaba <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1557cddf-bdb3-4f6f-8974-367f33a288bc\">recently applied</a> for a dual-primary listing in Hong Kong, signalling a possible plan B.&#xa0;</p> <p>Last week brought new hope when Washington and Beijing announced that they'd reached <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a9d18d7e-1e75-49fb-842d-d8554b420553\">a landmark deal</a> for US accounting regulators to inspect China-based audits.</p> <p>People close to the matter <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/322e1486-7c11-4582-aa36-39799bf30c51\">told the FT's</a> Tabby Kinder, Cheng Leng and Hudson Lockett that the agreement was based on the same deal signed between the superpowers in 2013. That deal turned out to be too good to be true — when US officials arrived in China they were stonewalled by regulators.</p> <p>This time round, auditors will transfer companies' financial working papers to Hong Kong due to China's strict protocols, where US officials will inspect them.</p> <p>China has already contacted the country's auditing firms — dominated by the Chinese arms of Big Four accountants <strong>PwC</strong>, <strong>Deloitte</strong>, <strong>KPMG </strong>and <strong>EY</strong> — and told them that they can hand over the necessary documents.</p> <p>But not everyone is convinced that Chinese companies' luck has changed. The big test will be to see if China actually follows through on its agreement to comply with US audit rules.</p> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, which has gleaned exorbitant fees from Chinese companies listing in New York during the past two decades, thinks it's still a coin toss.</p> <p><strong>Clement Chan</strong>, head of assurance at accounting firm <strong>BDO</strong> in Hong Kong, said: “My advice is don't count the chickens before they hatch.”</p> <p>The details have yet to be made public. China's top securities regulator said on Friday both sides had found a “feasible path” for the US to carry out audit inspections while maintaining China's national security over sensitive data. But China has a sprawling bureaucracy, and a huge number of authorities could intervene to stop some data being handed over. </p> <p>Plus, a discrepancy in the language each side used reveals a clash in the understanding of how involved Chinese authorities will be in the inspections. This adds yet more uncertainty to the next few months of work by the US and China in Hong Kong.</p> <p>Big Four auditors are also waiting with bated breath to see how the deal pans out. The firms have faced an increase in regulatory fines and shareholder lawsuits over their work in Europe and the US.&#xa0;</p> <p>Opening up their Chinese audits to US regulators could increase the chances of potential liability even further.</p> <h1>Consultants cash in on tough times</h1> <p><strong>Joe Biden</strong>'s cancellation of $10,000 worth of student debts for millions of Americans has been criticised in some quarters for the effect it could have in fanning the flames of rampant inflation. Similar fears have not deterred elite consultancies from handing big salary increases to new recruits. </p> <p><strong>McKinsey</strong>, <strong>Bain</strong> and<strong> Boston Consulting Group</strong> have unveiled one of the biggest rounds of pay rises for new hires in more than two decades, the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/678bc236-9008-4857-88b3-b7c875b7f965\"> FT's Michael O'Dwyer reports</a>. </p> <p>The management consultancies have lifted annual base salaries for MBA graduates in the US from $175,000 to between $190,000 and $192,000. </p> <p>It means top performers will receive more than $250,000 in their first year when performance-related and signing bonuses are included.</p> <p>Pay for graduate recruits in the US who don't have an MBA will be bumped 12 per cent to $112,000 a year at McKinsey and Bain while their counterparts at BCG will get $110,000, according to people with knowledge of the increases. </p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9a06af61-4aea-499a-a885-c0556a9c1a95\">recent slump</a> on Wall Street, where recruits had been lured by pay packages reaching into the six figures amid a fierce talent war, could give the consulting world a chance to catch up when it comes to attracting new talent.</p> <p>But recruiters at consultancies are still competing against the lure of Big Tech, corporate law firms, private equity and entrepreneurial start-ups that pay big cheques for talent. &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Fiona Czerniawska</strong>, chief executive of consulting sector analyst <strong>Source Global Research</strong>, says even as younger workers seek a better work-life balance, money is crucial. “Increasing salaries remains the most immediate and effective lever any professional service firm can pull if it wants to attract and retain high-calibre people,” she said.</p> <h1>Musk, Mudge, and a $44bn merger agreement</h1> <p>A quick update on the <strong>Twitter</strong> saga:</p> <p>As almost everyone on the planet (and maybe Mars) now knows, <strong>Elon Musk</strong> is trying to wrangle his way out of a $44bn deal to buy the social media platform.</p> <p>The <strong>Tesla</strong> boss claims that Twitter has breached the merger contract in various ways, but most notably by misrepresenting the number of bots on its platform. Twitter has disclosed that less than 5 per cent of its daily active users are spam accounts. Musk has claimed that it could actually be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1526465624326782976\">as much as 20 per cent</a>. </p> <p>We've discussed this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/09a2c37a-383a-4eaf-ac43-9063ba3f8999\">at great length</a>. Experts tend to side with Twitter and think it's going to be difficult for Musk to get out of the deal, at least without paying some enormous break-up fee. </p> <p>But Musk's lawyers at <strong>Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom</strong> think they may have a trump card in the shape of <strong>Peiter Zatko</strong>. The former Twitter employee turned whistleblower, who was fired by the company earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6afbc0b-6356-48b9-922b-5ea28eafacc3\">claims</a> that Twitter misled users and regulators about its cyber security defences.</p> <p>If it's true, Musk's lawyers claim <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a77d4001-628f-4d13-b864-f68d89b340b4\">in a filing released on Tuesday</a>, Zatko's allegations breach several aspects of the merger agreement struck in April. </p> <p>Known in cyber security circles as “Mudge”, Zatko has also been served with a subpoena from Musk's team to testify in the case, so the biggest show in corporate finance is getting another leading man. </p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Apollo</strong> has named <strong>Byron Vielehr </strong>as a partner and chief operating officer of its asset management arm. He was previously chief growth officer of US payments processor <strong>Fiserv</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>KKR</strong> has named <strong>David Krancenblum</strong> as head of France for credit and markets, based in Paris.
