Faber, who joined the group in 1997, continued its long tradition of espousing responsible capitalism. (Danone began reporting “climate adjusted” earnings per share last year.)&#xa0;</p> <p>While Bluebell and Artisan were careful not to directly attack Danone's ESG focus, they did say the balance between shareholders' interests and others had been lost under Faber, who has become the face of sustainability in corporate France.&#xa0;</p> <p>The activists proved victorious after a board meeting stretching into the late hours of Sunday evening, convincing Danone's board of directors to walk back on a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cce84e8e-6fd5-4ae9-880a-2c3d22482155\">two-week-old compromise</a> to keep Faber as chairman and hunt for a new CEO, and instead axe him altogether.</p> <p>Such sway by foreign investors is a far cry from 2005, when, under the threat of a rumoured bid by <strong>PepsiCo</strong>, then-French prime minister <strong>Dominique de Villepin</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d767f5e6-f93c-11d9-81f3-00000e2511c8\">vowed</a> to defend “the interests of France”, calling Danone a national “crown jewel”.</p> <p>Or from 2012, when <strong>Nelson Peltz</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12492d04-2812-11e2-afd2-00144feabdc0\">took a 1 per cent stake</a> of the dairy-focused group in the hopes of reviving its profitability, but made few waves.</p> <p>As it searches for a new leader, Faber's departure might be a lesson for Danone on striking the balance between finding a progressive CEO, and one that can still please shareholders.</p> <h2>Jardine Matheson: a new leader navigates a new Hong Kong</h2> <p>One of Hong Kong's oldest businesses is in the middle of a dramatic modernisation. <strong>Ben Keswick</strong> last year inherited the reins of<strong> Jardine Matheson</strong>, a 190-year-old conglomerate that has been built by his ancestors over five generations from a tea and opium trading house to a $50bn empire.&#xa0;</p> <p>And he's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03924f80-8600-427b-8d13-d5c890f39ffc\">wasted no time</a> pulling up the carpets, by launching a sweeping restructuring that will dismantle a business that gave his uncle, <strong>Henry Keswick</strong>, who ruled the family business for 47 years until he retired at the age of 80, ultimate investment decisions.&#xa0;</p> <p>He even entered into an unusual partnership with private equity group <strong>Hillhouse Capital</strong>, the purpose of which remains shrouded in secrecy, writes the FT's Tabby Kinder, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d617d57e-a7db-4784-960d-196f19b05c7b\">who profiled Keswick recently</a>.</p> <p>For Jardine's investors, the overhaul was long overdue. Now, the business must fight to protect itself from a sprawling old economy portfolio that has suffered during the coronavirus pandemic and disruption in Hong Kong.</p> <p>While his uncle was described as an Old Etonian with a “courtly air”, Ben's allies instead cite his frequent trips to San Francisco to understand how tech disrupters could change Jardine's business. “There was never any innovation before Ben,” the boss of one of Jardine's largest portfolio companies told the FT.</p> <p>The restructuring will probably add vast amounts to the multibillion-dollar Keswick family fortune. But that also means the dynasty will become further entwined with Jardine's share price.</p> <p>As one confidante to Ben put it: “He has created a more conventional set of risks. The largest being what happens if they don't deliver the numbers in two or three years.”</p> <p>And as China tightens its grip on Hong Kong, the future of the duopoly Jardine shares with fellow family-run empire <strong>Swire</strong> is becoming <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ab1091c-8ebc-47a9-b57c-0264ab75e677\">ever more uncertain.</a>&#xa0;</p> <h2>Davy: on the rebound</h2> <p>Wanted: buyer for an Irish stockbroker/wealth manager. Must have a strong stomach for scandals, watertight governance to satisfy Ireland's regulator, and a sizeable cheque book to keep talent on board.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's probably not quite how <strong>Rothschild</strong>, its financial adviser, is pitching the hunt for a new owner for <strong>Davy Group</strong>, but it covers all the bases.&#xa0;</p> <p>Davy, considered Ireland's answer to <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong>, has spent the past two weeks floundering under a scandal that prompted sharp intakes of breath on both sides of the Irish Sea.&#xa0;</p> <p>The FT's Laura Noonan chronicles the scandal <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e250dfc3-a042-4e34-9684-c110891966fe\">in this in-depth piece</a>, but the crux of it is that 16 Davy staff, including some senior executives, set up a consortium to buy <strong>Anglo Irish Bank </strong>bonds from a client, without telling the client they were the buyer.</p> <p>One adviser at a company in Dublin said Davy's ownership structure, where it is owned by current and former staff, always left it open to looser governance.&#xa0;</p> <p>That's something policymakers and politicians are hoping will change with the upcoming sale. Wealth management is Davy's most marketable business and big foreign names like <strong>Julius Baer</strong> and <strong>UBS </strong>have been mentioned as potential suitors.&#xa0;</p> <p>Advisers say those banks would look at it, but their level of interest is unclear and they would likely need a lot of reassurance to take on the reputational risk.</p> <p>Some argue that private equity would be a more logical fit, especially since the deal would make most sense if it was structured with an earn-out, to incentivise Davy's key staff to stay.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Bank of Ireland</strong>, Davy's historic owner, was kicking the tyres before Davy even hoisted the for sale sign, and almost everyone thinks that an Irish solution of some sort is the most likely solution.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Simon Hu</strong>, chief executive of <strong>Ant Group</strong>, has resigned, just as the fintech group is about to embark on a big restructuring at the behest of China's regulators. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03b3fc90-816b-4467-bf25-a63d977ca7c3\">More here</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Simon Mackenzie Smith</strong>, who is chairman of corporate and investment banking for the UK and Ireland at <strong>Bank of America</strong>, will retire this summer after 25 years at the bank.&#xa0;</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Goldman Sachs </strong>has nominated <strong>Royal Dutch Shell </strong>chief financial officer <strong>Jessica Uhl</strong> to become its newest board director.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Latham &amp; Watkins </strong>has appointed New York partner <strong>Lisa Watts</strong> as vice-chair of the firm. She joins Chicago partner <strong>Brad Kotler</strong>, who currently serves as one of the firm's two vice-chairs, and succeeds Bay Area partner<strong> Ora Fisher</strong>, who is retiring later this year.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett </strong>has hired <strong>Benjamin Rippeon</strong> as a partner in its tax practice. He joins the Washington office from <strong>Gibson Dunn</strong>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Linklaters </strong>has added <strong>Xiaoxi Lin</strong> and <strong>Alessandro Nolet </strong>as partners in its Hong Kong office. They join from <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis </strong>and <strong>White &amp; Case</strong>, respectively.</p></li> </ul> <h2>Smart reads&#xa0;</h2> <p><strong>All that glitters isn't gold </strong>The mood at Goldman Sachs should be celebratory as shares skyrocket and the 1MDB scandal finally fizzles out. But unexpected high-profile departures and tussles over the corporate jet and work-from-home etiquette spell trouble in paradise for CEO David Solomon. (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-14/goldman-ceo-s-year-of-empty-offices-island-getaways-and-strife?sref=OziMsGoK\">BBG</a>)</p> <p><strong>In it for the long haul </strong>Vista Equity Partners chief Robert Smith settled one of the largest tax fraud cases in US history. The buyout group's investors, including public pension plans, sovereign wealth funds and charitable endowments, barely blinked. (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/business/robert-smith-vista-investors.html\">NYT</a>)</p> <p><strong>Help wanted </strong>UK telecoms group BT was just beginning to recuperate from years of regulatory issues and political strife when a boardroom flare-up triggered the unexpected resignation of its chairman Jan du Plessis.
