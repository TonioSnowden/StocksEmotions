  "title": "Chinese Developer Is In Fresh Trouble Months After Debt Swap; Yango Group didn't pay $27 million before end of grace period",
  "text": "<p>Some of the industry's biggest players and largest international borrowers, such as China Evergrande Group and Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd., have already been judged in default on international debt collectively running into the tens of billions of dollars.</p><p>Because of factors \"including the macroeconomic environment, the regulations on real estate and financial industry and the Covid-19 pandemic, the company is facing a temporary cash-flow issue,\" Yango Group said in a filing late Thursday.</p><p>The Fujian-based real-estate group said a 30-day grace period for paying the interest on the bonds, which were issued by its Yango Justice International Ltd. unit, ended earlier this week. The interest due totaled $27.3 million.</p><p>Bondholders have been caught out in recent months by sudden shifts by some Chinese real-estate companies. For instance, luxury developer Fantasia Holdings Group Co. made a U-turn that caught the market off guard. After saying that it had \"no liquidity issue\" in late September, the following month Fantasia defaulted on a maturing bond, triggering a broader trust crisis among investors in property bonds.</p><p>A failure to pay interest by the end of a grace period would typically count as an event of default. That would allow bondholders to demand that the company make an accelerated repayment of the outstanding interest and principal they are due.</p><p>Yango Group's biggest shareholder, Fujian Yango Group Co., also failed to pay overdue interest on a $296 million bond in late December.</p><p>Yango Group, which is no longer rated by any of the major credit-rating companies, didn't use the term default in its Thursday filings and said it would communicate with investors and the bonds' trustee to obtain the necessary waiver.</p><p>In November, Yango Group succeeded in persuading the majority of holders of three offshore bonds to swap their holdings for $670 million of new bonds, saying the deal would help avert imminent default and a potential restructuring.</p><p>Some 40% of the $6.3 billion of high-yield Chinese property bonds set to mature last month were swapped into new bonds, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a late January research note. An additional 15% have defaulted, they added.</p><p>On Friday, a Yango Justice International bond due in 2023 was bid at 17 cents on the dollar, according to Tradeweb, indicating investors have little confidence of getting repaid in full. The unit is a substantial offshore borrower, with Tradeweb listing bonds with a total face value of about $2.2 billion.</p><p>Yango Group's contracted sales tumbled 52% in January from a year before, to 6.7 billion yuan, or the equivalent of $1.1 billion.</p><p>Write to Rebecca Feng at rebecca.feng@wsj.com</p><p>Chinese Developer Is In Fresh Trouble Months After Debt Swap</p>",
