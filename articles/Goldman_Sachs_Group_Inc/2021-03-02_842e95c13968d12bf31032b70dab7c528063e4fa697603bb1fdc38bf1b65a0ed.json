But the soon-to-be nonagenarian has been busy turning <strong>Fox News</strong> <strong>Channel </strong>into a controversial conservative powerhouse, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d860a116-4de1-11e8-97e4-13afc22d86d4\">making advantageous friends</a> in the White House (albeit there was probably quite a lot of golfing there), <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aef7357e-e1b2-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce\">making $71bn</a> from<strong> Disney</strong> for most of 21st Century Fox, and, most recently, closing a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4e09ffb-4ca9-4004-9f8e-33bf13080ce9\">global content deal</a> with <strong>Google</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>But it's the deals Murdoch <em>didn't </em>make that will define his empire's next chapter. The family patriarch held on to a collection of his “favourite toys” after the Disney sale — Fox News, newspapers including The Sun and the New York Post, and other television networks.&#xa0;</p> <p>The 2019 deal forbade any further sales for a two-year period, a restriction that was lifted last month. That means — assuming Murdoch isn't actually immortal — his inner circle is preparing for a flurry of dealmaking to hand off his legacy.</p> <p><strong>Lachlan Murdoch</strong>, the eldest son, is heir apparent to it all. But the succession question still looms ahead.&#xa0;</p> <p>The trust acts as one in company matters, wielding roughly 40 per cent of voting B shares. Once the next generation takes over, however, the power to determine the trust's position is dispersed equally between Murdoch's four eldest children, while his youngest two daughters are beneficiaries.</p> <p>None of the children have the votes to exert control alone, and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/285512c3-52c3-4f21-bb8b-ca89c9e241da\">clashing views</a> between the siblings could stand in the way of reaching any easy consensus.&#xa0;</p> <p>There are three potential scenarios for how it could all play out, depending on how much control Lachlan wishes to retain over his father's legacy, according to insiders:</p> <ol>  <li><p>Selling Fox — it's an option sources close to Murdoch say he could be obliged to, if it's in his family's best interest. But there may not be a long line of bidders. “You're unlikely to see any well-known private equity group like <strong>Blackstone</strong> or <strong>KKR</strong> taking over. The reputational risk is huge,” one executive said.&#xa0;</p></li>  <li><p>Reuniting parts of Fox with News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal and other publications, and handing over the reins to News Corp chief and longtime Murdoch confidant <strong>Robert Thomson</strong>.</p></li>  <li><p>Placing Lachlan in charge and letting things carry on the way they are. The move would still require some reshuffling assets, but is in many ways the preferred option, said people close to Murdoch.</p></li> </ol> <p>Go deeper with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9719c27-5e95-49c3-a534-2796196c6af7\">this big read</a> on what's next for the Murdoch empire by the FT's Alex Barker and Anna Nicolaou, and DD's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/james-fontanella-khan\">James Fontanella-Khan</a>.</p> <h2>Dealmakers spin the Spac wheel of fortune</h2> <p>If anyone needed further proof that blank-cheque companies have become a staple of Wall Street, they need only look at the level of dealmaking in February.&#xa0;</p> <p>Special purpose acquisition companies, or Spacs, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/abcf1dad-833d-4620-ab57-96ea01d918ed\">struck $109bn worth of deals globally</a> last month alone, according to Refinitiv data.&#xa0;</p> <p>There are some familiar names that have contributed heavily to the deal total, such as the electric car maker <strong>Lucid</strong>, which agreed to go public via a merger with <strong>Churchill Capital IV </strong><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/299c38f9-538e-4d70-9882-59f08242e9cb\">at a $24bn valuation</a> — the largest deal to date for Spacs.&#xa0;</p> <p>Others include <strong>Joby Aviation</strong>, the electric flying taxi developer, that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fed9f16e-0ebf-471b-bd10-9698784537df\">announced a deal</a> with a Spac set up by<strong> Reid Hoffman </strong>and <strong>Mark Pincus</strong>, respectively the co-founders of LinkedIn and Zynga. Its rival Archer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2e63918-fca1-4ca6-b5bf-5e72a67133a6\">will also go public</a> in a transaction with a blank-cheque company backed by the investment banker <strong>Ken Moelis</strong>.</p> <p>What do these companies have in common? Aside from all developing electric modes of transport, they also have no revenues to speak of. This is the Spac trend<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/688d8472-c404-42d6-88b7-fbd475e50f7c\"> we've been telling you about</a>.</p> <p>Revenues, and at times even proof of concept, isn't that important to Spac deals because unlike traditional listings, companies that go public via a blank-cheque vehicle are allowed to show projections. Some seem reasonable while others veer into the ridiculous but the idea is to sell the dream — like imminent space travel, for one.</p> <p>Several dealmakers have described investing in these start-ups as taking the “spray and pray” approach. Invest in as many companies as possible and one will, hopefully, turn out to be the next <strong>Google</strong> or <strong>Amazon</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The frenzied dealmaking and rapid fundraising — 188 vehicles have raised $58bn so far this year, marking a significant acceleration from 2020 when 244 Spacs raised $78bn across the year as a whole — is doing nothing to assuage fears that a bubble has formed. Especially at these valuations.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Novavax: vaccinated ever-after</h2> <p>Third time's the charm, they say. What about the 33rd time?</p> <p>That's how many years it took <strong>Novavax</strong>, after pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into research and development for vaccines without a single approved shot, to near its first success story.&#xa0;</p> <p>The pharmaceuticals company was facing a delisting from the <strong>Nasdaq </strong>exchange just a year before the pandemic struck, with short interest hitting 30 per cent as of January last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>Shortseller <strong>Citron Research</strong> reportedly dismissed them as a “serial promise and non-deliver[er]” in a deleted tweet.</p> <p>Novavax chief <strong>Stanley Erck </strong>isn't losing any sleep over the short-seller's soiled bets. “The shorts are not my friends, ever. I love to disappoint the shorts,” he <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c8aa79c1-5f18-47d8-a09c-c13547e7a57d#post-9577c498-f633-42d2-bad3-024834fbc9f7\">told</a> the FT's Hannah Kuchler.</p> <p>Now, its Covid vaccine is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ceebd562-7b50-427b-932f-40f2adfe5e26\">swiftly approaching</a> approval in the UK, with the US <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2dffdd47-4d0c-48cc-a729-8f33709c259d\">next on its radar</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>“It's a Cinderella story,” said <strong>Stacey Schultz-Cherry</strong>, an infectious disease specialist at<strong> St Jude Children's Research Hospital</strong> in Tennessee, of the small company's ability to compete with more established players.</p> <p>For everyone except the short-sellers, that is.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Mark Machin</strong>, the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/12ad073c-2a9a-4cb0-8452-ce4e50b216be\">head</a> of Canada's largest pension fund, has resigned after he travelled to the United Arab Emirates and received the Covid-19 vaccine.
