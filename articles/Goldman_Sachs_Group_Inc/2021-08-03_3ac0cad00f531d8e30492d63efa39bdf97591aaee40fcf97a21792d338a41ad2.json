  "text": "<p>BP raised its dividend and launched a $1.4bn cash return after delivering quarterly results that beat expectations.</p> <p>The energy major, whose chief executive Bernard Looney has been leading a pivot towards renewable energy, said underlying profit on a replacement cost basis rose to $2.8bn in the second quarter, surpassing expectations for around $2.2bn. </p> <p>Looney said the company was raising its dividend by 4 per cent and would have the “capacity” to grow it by a similar amount each year through 2025.</p> <p>“On average at around $60 a barrel, we expect to be able to deliver buybacks of around $1bn per quarter and to have capacity for an annual increase in the dividend of around 4 per cent through 2025,” he said. “This shows we continue to perform while transforming BP.”&#xa0;</p> <h1>Briefly</h1> <p><strong>Standard Chartered</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c0c28c8-1374-41b9-8248-0b49466bb095\">reported a surge in profits</a> and said it would resume paying dividends amid an improving economic outlook. The emerging markets-focused bank delivered a pre-tax profit of $1.15bn in the second quarter, up 55 per cent on the same period last year and beating consensus analyst estimates of $1.1bn. StanChart also announced a $250m share buyback and said it would pay an interim dividend of 3 cents per share, totalling $94m.</p> <p><strong>Greggs</strong> said the strength of its recent performance suggested full-year profit will be slightly ahead of its previous expectation. Like-for-like sales in the six months ended July were down 9.2 per cent versus the pre-pandemic period two years ago, the bakery chain said. It reported an underlying interim pre-tax profit of £55.5m, versus a £64.5m a year ago, as sales surged 81.7 per cent to £546.2m.</p> <p><strong>Domino's Pizza</strong> boosted a share buyback programme after making a strong start to the second half. The franchise owner reported system sales up 19.6 per cent to £752.3m and an underlying pre-tax profit up 27.7 per cent to £60.8m in the first half.</p> <p><strong>Travis Perkins</strong> reinstated its ordinary dividend, raised full-year profit guidance and paid out a special dividend on booming demand for construction supplies. The builders' merchant targeted an adjusted operating profit at least £310m from continuing businesses, up £10m on its previous guidance, after reporting a nearly nine-fold jump in half-year earnings to £163.8m. </p> <p><strong>TP ICAP</strong> said less volatile markets and a stronger pound meant first-half revenue fell 5 per cent to £936m. The interdealer broker said it expects full-year revenue excluding Liquidnet, its recently acquired institutional trading network and dark pool operator, to be broadly in line with 2020 on a currency-adjusted basis. But investment requirements and the strengthening pound will have an adverse impact on operating margin, TP ICAP cautioned.</p> <p>Silver miner <strong>Fresnillo</strong> said it remained on track to meet 2021 targets, but was assessing any possible impact from new labour laws in Mexico. The company cut its capital expenditure budget by $100m to $580m after posting a half-year gross profit of $606.8m, up 88.9 per cent year on year.</p> <p><strong>AG Barr</strong>, the soft-drink maker, left full-year targets unchanged and said in a trading update that like-for-like sales in the half year just ended were up around 13 per cent. </p> <p><strong>Hiscox</strong> swung into profit at the half-year stage and said Covid-related claims this year will be lower than previously expected. The insurer posted a $133.4m interim pre-tax profit as gross premiums written grew 8.5 per cent to $2.4bn. A settlement with policyholders over business interruption losses last year had meant it reported a loss of $138.9m in the same period of 2020.</p> <p><strong>Direct Line</strong> said lower than normal claims have continued to boost earnings as the pandemic keeps drivers off the roads. The insurer posted a half-year operating profit of £369.9m, up from £264.9m a year earlier.</p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <p>Engineer <strong>Rotork</strong> said that chief executive Kevin Hostetler wants to return home to the US with his young family next year, so will step down by the end of June 2022. The company said it had started a search for his successor. Interim results from Rotork reinstated the company's dividend and reported an adjusted operating profit up 6.5 per cent to £62.7m.</p> <h1>Beyond the Square Mile</h1> <p><strong>Société Générale</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee7669f7-9f9a-4ed1-b64d-a3fcdf463f0f\">continued its resurgence</a> from last year's steep trading losses, reporting its best first-half performance in five years. The Paris-based lender, which was hit by the implosion of its equity derivatives products last spring, said it had made €1.4bn of net income for the second quarter of 2021.</p> <p><strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b33f3645-ff93-4309-a575-f92641faaa43\">raised</a>&#xa0;junior staff salaries in response to complaints of burnout from recruits caught in the pandemic dealmaking boom.&#xa0;First-year analysts will earn a base wage of $110,000, excluding annual bonuses. Separately, Goldman is looking to&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9fb175d7-fcf2-4d82-be0a-62ec49b6ab27\">slash</a>&#xa0;its equity investments portfolio, relying instead on fees from pension funds and wealthy clients to bring in asset management revenue.</p> <p>Shares in <strong>Tencent</strong> and other Chinese video game companies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1ee4f40b-cad8-45f7-b8dd-de25b89736d3\">fell more than 10 per cent</a> after state media lambasted online games as “spiritual opium”, in the latest broadside from Beijing against the country's tech groups. The article in the Economic Information Daily newspaper, which is run by state news agency Xinhua, said online video games had grown into “spiritual opium worth hundreds of billions”.</p> <p><strong>US forests</strong> that generate the carbon offsets&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3f89c759-eb9a-4dfb-b768-d4af1ec5aa23\">bought by companies</a> including BP and Microsoft are on fire as blazes rage in North America. Corporate net-zero emission pledges rely on such projects to compensate for the carbon dioxide they generate.</p> <p>The IMF has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c36c45d2-1100-4756-a752-07a217b2bde0\">warned against</a> using <strong>cryptocurrencies</strong> as&#xa0;legal tender,&#xa0;just over a month before El Salvador is set to become the&#xa0;first&#xa0;nation to allow bitcoin payments for everything from haircuts to taxes.</p> <h1>Essential comment before you go</h1> <p><strong>Bryce Elder</strong> <br>The government needs to seek <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cf377a9c-390c-4ad8-b604-807ecadd2c6d\">firmer commitments from Ohio-based Parker Hannifin</a> around jobs and investment before approving its proposed £6.3bn purchase of aerospace engineer Meggitt. But national security concerns seem negligible, so blocking the deal outright would be a shareholder-hostile act of political cynicism.</p> <p><strong>Sarah O'Connor</strong> <br>Falling birth rates are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f57f3c31-e622-425e-9aee-5261803cb275\">good news for the planet</a>. Rapid population growth has helped to put the environment under extreme stress. But they are also a symptom of generational inequality. A stressed generation without faith in the future is a warning sign we should heed.</p><p>Source: Bryce Elder 2021 'BP launches $1.4bn cash return to shareholders as profits beat expectations' FT.com 3 August.
