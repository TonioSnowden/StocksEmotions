  "title": "Deliveroo set to float with a value of £7.6bn",
  "text": "<p><strong>Deliveroo</strong> will price its flotation 390p a share, the very bottom of the range, according to bookrunners on the landmark float.</p> <p>At that price the courier dispatch company will debut on Wednesday morning with a value of £7.6bn — well short of its initial target of as much as £8.9bn. Deliveroo on Monday lowered its indicative range to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fc502ce-6651-4e9b-a810-f399449e828d\">between 390p and 410p</a>, with books due to close at 1pm today.</p> <p>Funds including Aviva, Aberdeen Standard and Legal &amp; General have all shunned Deliveroo's IPO over concerns about its business model, working practices and regulatory risk. Deliveroo has said it wanted to price “responsibly” to ensure “long-term value” for investors buying in at the IPO, which includes a&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/76d7c370-8e02-4d05-b2d2-48d3b2d18223\">£50m allocation&#xa0;</a>for its own customers.</p> <h2>Briefly</h2> <p><strong>Royal Mail</strong> is to pay a one-off special dividend of 10p a share for the year ended March. Trading is “broadly in line” with an update published on March 10, with year-end adjusted operating profit still expected to be around £700m, the company said.</p> <p><strong>Cairn Energy</strong> said the government of India has petitioned the Dutch Court of Appeal to reverse a ruling that India had breached treaty obligations with the UK. The oil explorer was last year awarded costs and damages worth $1.2bn for a tax dispute with India dating back to 2015. “Cairn has full confidence in its position,” the company said.&#xa0;“As previously advised, Cairn will continue to take all steps necessary in order to protect the interests of its shareholders.”</p> <p><strong>Imperial Brands</strong> said results for the full year ending September will be in line with guidance given in November, with low-mid single-digit organic adjusted operating profit growth at constant currency. First half group net revenue is expected to grow by at least 1 per cent on an organic, constant currency basis, driven by continued strong pricing in tobacco, as well as some benefit from growth in next-generation product revenues against a weak comparator period, it said.</p> <p><strong>SSE</strong> said it expects the impact of coronavirus on adjusted operating profit in its fiscal year ending March to be around £180m compared to the previously forecast £150m to £250m range. That saving will offset a weather-related shortfall in output from renewable energy sources, meaning earnings per share will still be in the previously guided range of 85p to 90p, the utility said.&#xa0;</p> <p>Water utility <strong>Pennon</strong> said in a trading update for its March year end that it is on track to deliver “resilient” financial results in line with management expectations. </p> <p><strong>Numis</strong> said it expects to report revenue up 75 per cent to £110m in the fiscal first half ended March, with both its investment banking and equities divisions beating the record performance reported in the second half of 2020.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Oxford Nanopore</strong>, the gene analysis company, said it <a href=\"https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/oxford-nanopore-notification-ipo-preparations\">plans to float</a> on the London Stock Exchange in the second half of 2021, dependent on market conditions. Listed technology investor <strong>IP Group</strong> said it holds a 15 per cent stake in Oxford Nanopore, valued at £340.3m.</p> <h2>Beyond the Square Mile&#xa0;</h2> <p>The biggest counterparties of Bill Hwang's <strong>Archegos Capital</strong> last week discussed ways <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/db4508ed-ccb4-48f6-8dd6-dd7d38e3cfa4\">to limit the market fallout</a> from his collapsing bets on stocks including ViacomCBS, according to four people briefed on the talks, but the effort foundered and paved the way for days of&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2542af81-9e93-4d05-a0b9-26c0f6aab6f3\">chaotic trading</a>. The banks had each allowed Archegos to take on billions of dollars of exposure to volatile equities through&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/75dfd4b8-2d00-4e6c-a8e4-7e14dce9e278\">swaps contracts</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/79d29496-8785-4d55-af2a-8619cf99a613\">Goldman Sachs</a>.</p> <p>Christian Sewing is set to stay in charge of <strong>Deutsche Bank</strong> for five more years after its supervisory board extended the chief executive's contract until 2026, Germany's largest lender <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a52e19f-5b13-44a9-bdbd-58dfae8df000\">announced on Monday</a>. The 50-year-old, whose current contract was set to expire next year, has been at the helm of Deutsche since April 2018, when his predecessor John Cryan was ousted in an acrimonious boardroom battle.</p> <p>Russia's largest bank and the owner of the country's biggest social media network plan to break up a $1.6bn joint venture, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b524802-164a-4284-806a-e5dc781330d4\">according to three people familiar with the situation</a>. <strong>Sberbank</strong> and <strong>Mail.ru</strong> recently sought permission from the Kremlin to split the assets of their joint venture, including Delivery Club, a food delivery app, and Citymobil, a taxi app. The two sides have clashed over strategy as their lossmaking tie-up has struggled against a profitable competitor from their main rival, Yandex.</p> <h2>Essential comment before you go</h2> <p><strong>Helen Thomas</strong> <br>There is concern that the craze around special purpose acquisition companies (Spacs) is affecting everyone's thinking when it comes to reforming the market for IPOs, as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d9cabd2-cad3-48a2-98b4-41515c00d8bf\">the contrasting fortunes</a> of Deliveroo and Cazoo illustrate.</p> <p><strong>Sarah O'Connor <br></strong>Living longer does not mean we should all work longer. Health inequalities mean <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/708189c6-c6db-4c37-8fac-fb71f95d5b4d\">raising the pension age</a> could hurt low-paid workers.</p> <p><strong>Thanks for reading.
