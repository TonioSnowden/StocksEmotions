  "text": "<p>See also: Mark Cuban says buying metaverse real estate is 'the dumbest shit ever'</p><p>When Tatis, now 23, was a teenager playing Single-A baseball, he signed a contract with Big League Advance, a firm that invests in young athletes. The firm spreads its investments across dozens of athlete prospects by giving them upfront cash in exchange for a percentage of their future earnings.</p><p>According to Big League Advance, the firm spread out $26 million among 77 minor league baseball players in 2017, including Tatis. Players like Tatis then agree to give up anywhere between 1% and 12% of future MLB earnings. The typical deal is for 8% of future earnings, but the firm has not stated details of Tatis's contract, according to Sportico. The contract applies to MLB earnings and not endorsements.</p><p>If Tatis's deal was for 8% of his earnings, that would mean $27.2 million of this contract will go to Big League Advance.</p><p>A contract like Tatis just signed is a home run for the firm.</p><p>\"When we signed him he wasn't considered a Top 40 prospect,\" Big League Advance CEO Michael Schwimer said about Tatis. \"At the time, talking to investors, the amount of money we were offering him was a sizable portion of our bankroll. But we trusted the model.\"</p><p>Tatis's father also played professional baseball, tallying over $18 million in career earnings, according to contract data from Spotrac.</p><p>Considering how difficult it is to make it to MLB from the minor leagues, the risk mitigation can be worth it for some athletes to take the quick money — only about 10% of minor leaguers make the big leagues, according to data from MotherJones.</p><p>Big League Advance, which was founded by Schwimer in 2016, has investors including mutual-fund manager Bill Miller, former Goldman Sachs GS partner Steven Duncker, former President George W. Bush's brother Marvin Bush, and Cleveland Browns executive Paul DePodesta.</p><p>See also: Serena Williams retiring from tennis to focus on family — and her venture-capital firm</p><p>Athletes are no strangers to inventive contract structures. One famous example is New York Mets player Bobby Bonilla, who agreed to forgo the $5.9 million the Mets owed him in an upfront payment in 2000, in favor of payments spread out over 24 years with an annual 8% interest rate.</p><p>When all payments to Bonilla conclude, in 2035, his total payout will be for $29.8 million; this will be one year after Tatis's 14-year, $340 million contract expires.</p><p>Fernando Tatis Jr.'s $340 million contract will be shared with a firm that invested in him when he was a teenager</p>",
