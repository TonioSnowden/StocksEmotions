  "text": "<p>Pressure is building on Seven &amp; i Holdings, the owner of Japan's largest convenience store chain, to split the company as investors grow increasingly frustrated with “outdated” governance and poor share price performance.</p> <p>Three top-30 shareholders, which have previously told Seven &amp; i that they believed a sweeping restructuring was necessary, are considering submitting proposals at the company's annual meeting, expected in May or June, according to people familiar with the matter.</p> <p>US-based asset manager Artisan Partners, one of the three shareholders, is among the investors that said Seven &amp; i, which owns the 7-Eleven convenience store brand, had failed to keep pace with <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a8de1297-52b1-4ee7-aa24-b4e966790dba\">recent improvements</a> in Japanese governance standards. They also argued that it had not fought hard enough to boost its share price, which has significantly underperformed the market over the past five years.</p> <p>Investors have complained that the businesses that Seven &amp; i operates outside its lucrative convenience store brand, such as department stores, are weighing on its stock and should be separated from the group. </p> <p>Calls for a split have intensified since investors in Toshiba last year forced it to launch a strategic review that resulted in a recommendation to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f27efd7-5a85-4056-8d9a-da5fbbbc448f\">divide the company in three</a>.</p> <p>Artisan Partners wrote to the board members of Seven &amp; i this month complaining of the company's “outdated governance structure”, lacklustre stock performance and low valuation, according to a letter seen by the Financial Times.</p> <p>Two of the shareholders told the FT that they had specifically asked the company to consider a split within the past few months and were considering making formal proposals for change at the annual meeting.</p> <p>The retailer has previously come under investor pressure to reform from activist funds including Daniel Loeb's Third Point and ValueAct, but this is the first time a long-term investor has voiced concerns. </p> <p>“The company needs a stronger board of directors to address the distinct differences between the company's valuable convenience store assets and the company's other retail businesses,” said the Wisconsin-based Artisan Partners. </p> <p>Seven &amp; i declined to comment “on individual shareholders' cases” and said that “it will continue to engage in dialogue with [its] shareholders”.</p> <p>In 2016, Third Point <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/08e45f30-8aed-11e6-8aa5-f79f5696c731\">backed</a> now-chief executive Ryuichi Isaka in a boardroom tussle but the hoped-for turnround of the sprawling conglomerate has not materialised, the investors said. </p> <p>Since then, however, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a36f3b0-4419-11ea-a43a-c4b328d9061c\">activist shareholders have made inroads</a> in Japan, a shift in culture exemplified by the showdown over Toshiba between the management and a cast of global fund managers.</p> <p>Artisan Partners, which has $175bn of assets under management, said in the letter it owned about 1 per cent of Seven &amp; i shares and had been a shareholder since mid-2019. </p> <p>For the six months to November, Seven &amp; i's department stores posted an operating loss of ¥10.2bn ($87m) and Ito-Yokado and other supermarkets recorded a 49 per cent year-on-year decline despite efforts to cut costs through a series of store closures. That was in stark contrast to the performance of its convenience store businesses, notably overseas, where operating profit was up 56 per cent.</p> <p>The group should appoint mostly outside directors with relevant experience to its board and be led by an “unaffiliated, independent chair”, Artisan Partners said in its letter.</p> <p>Seven &amp; i expanded its international operation with the $21bn takeover of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/91464a43-68ac-47c5-b70d-8e16914db7e6\">American Speedway</a> convenience store chain, agreed in 2020.</p> <p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs praised the move but warned that if planned reforms of “low-margin businesses such as department store and superstore” were slow, that “would see downside risk to our earnings estimates and target price”.</p><p>Source: Antoni Slodkowski and Leo Lewis in Tokyo 2022 '7-Eleven owner faces investor calls to split up' FT.com 24 January.
