  "title": "Derby's Take: In Balance-Sheet Debate, Pay Closest Attention to the Hawks",
  "text": "<p>Both were ahead of the curve in calling for the Fed to pare back on its asset-buying stimulus efforts, which the central bank started doing in November. They also have been calling for the Fed to reduce its $8.8 trillion balance sheet, swollen with its purchases of Treasury and mortgage securities, although that has yet to happen.</p><p>\"The hawks have been on the right side of the debate all year,\" SGH Macro Advisors chief economist Tim Duy said in a research note, adding that in terms of those who would argue against taking away stimulus, \"there aren't any doves left; the data crushed that side of the policy argument.\"</p><p>On Friday, Mr. Waller explained how much and when he would like the central bank to take action to reduce its holdings.</p><p>\"I don't see any reason to delay balance-sheet adjustment,\" Mr. Waller said. He spoke just a few days after the Fed's final monetary policy meeting of the year, where officials sped up their drawdown in asset buying with an eye toward ending them in March. The Federal Open Market Committee also penciled in three rate increases for 2022, up from one as they projected in September.</p><p>Mr. Waller said the Fed could raise rates at its March meeting, and some private analysts agree, while other forecasters reckon the first move up from near zero will come later.</p><p>As soon as the Fed stops buying Treasury and mortgage bonds that swell its holdings, it would need to decide whether to buy a small amount of some combination of those securities to replace maturing bonds and keep the balance sheet steady, or allow overall holdings to shrink as these bonds mature. The last time the Fed took steps to lower its balance sheet, it first stopped expanding its holdings in 2014 before allowing an outright contraction in 2017.</p><p>The timing of a Fed rate rise is key, Mr. Waller said.</p><p>\"We could start reducing the balance sheet not too long after liftoff, maybe not the next meeting, but within a meeting or two after that,\" he said. Mr. Waller said returning to something like the pre-pandemic level of holdings—the Fed balance sheet was at $4.2 trillion in March 2020, at the start of the pandemic—is a \"reasonable benchmark.\" Getting the balance sheet back to around 20% of the nation's gross domestic product would be a good end point for the reduction, he said, noting the balance sheet is now at 35% of GDP.</p><p>Mr. Waller thinks an aggressive move to reduce the size of the balance sheet would go down fine with markets because he sees evidence the Fed has stuffed too much cash into the system already. The Fed governor pointed to the central bank's reverse repo facility.</p><p>Over recent days, this tool, which takes in cash from money-market funds and other eligible firms, has seen usage soar. It took in a record $1.75 trillion on Tuesday, after negligible use of the facility in the spring. This is money \"the market doesn't want or need,\" which is why firms have been lending it to the Fed in exchange for Treasurys, and it can be taken out with relative ease, Mr. Waller said.</p><p>Even with the Fed slowing the pace of asset buying, reverse repos may see more growth before coming down. Scott Skyrm, who leads money-market trading firm Curvature Securities, said in a note Tuesday that eligible firms will likely pump nearly $2 trillion into the Fed facility at year's end.</p><p>While Mr. Bullard is on board with the possibility of moving Fed holdings down in the new year, other central bank officials haven't had much to say about it. Central bank leader Jerome Powell said after the last Fed meeting that policy makers have only begun to discuss what to do with the balance sheet and haven't made any decisions.</p><p>Goldman Sachs' economists are among the forecasters that believe the Fed will shrink its holdings next year. Brean Capital forecasters wrote to clients that the balance-sheet drawdown will happen much faster than most on Wall Street expect.</p><p>Write to Michael S. Derby at michael.derby@wsj.com</p>",
