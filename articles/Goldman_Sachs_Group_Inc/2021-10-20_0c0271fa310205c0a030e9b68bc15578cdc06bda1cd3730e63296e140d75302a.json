  "title": "Day Traders Drive Uranium Prices,  Drawn by Cheap Bets via New Trust  ----  By Joe Wallace",
  "text": "<p>   Enthusiasm from individual traders is reshaping the market for nuclear fuel that generates a tenth of the world's electricity and sending uranium-linked stocks higher. </p><p>   Spot uranium prices, which languished for a decade after the Fukushima disaster led Japan and Germany to close nuclear reactors, have shot up to $47.10 a pound from $32.25 at the start of August. They remain below their peak of $137 in 2007, according to price-tracker UxC LLC. </p><p>   U.S.-listed shares of Canadian uranium company Cameco Corp. have jumped more than 20% in October and almost doubled in 2021. Fellow Canadian miner Denison Mines Corp. has surged 25% this month and almost tripled this year. Texas-based Uranium Energy Corp. has climbed 17% in October. </p><p>   Behind the rally: a run-up in uranium prices driven by individual traders, who have flocked to a new trust that gives a cheap and easy way of betting on the nuclear-fuel market. The Toronto-listed trust, run by Sprott Asset Management LP, has twice raised new cash from shareholders and snapped up uranium since the summer. Its shares have climbed to $12.49 as of Monday, up 49% from their inception in July. </p><p>   Sprott's purchases are helping to drain a uranium glut that accumulated after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Stop-and-start buying by the trust has led to wild price swings with little or no justification based on fundamentals such as supply from mines or demand from utilities, traders say. </p><p>   \"These periods of intense volatility are going to become the norm,\" said Hyder Ramatala, vice president for trading at UG USA, a unit of French nuclear-fuel company Orano SA. New vehicles for betting on uranium prices will push peaks in prices higher and troughs lower, he added. </p><p>   Uranium stocks rose further this week after the world's biggest producer, the Kazakh state-backed miner Kazatomprom, launched a uranium fund of its own in partnership with Kazakhstan's central bank and Genchi Global Ltd., an Emirati investment firm. The fund will start with $50 million with plans to raise as much as $500 million more from institutional or private investors. </p><p>   The gyrations in uranium prices echo trading in stocks including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. and GameStop Corp., which attracted ardent followings among individual day traders who gather on Reddit. </p><p>   Even more so than videogame stores and theater chains, uranium is an unlikely candidate to be jolted by a gush of retail money. Utilities, miners, specialist traders and a clutch of hedge funds and banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have long dominated the market. </p><p>   Most U3O8, a form of lightly processed uranium that is yet to be enriched and made into fuel rods, is sold in long-term deals. Futures seldom change hands. </p><p>   The sleepy market has picked up pace. Traders estimate that between 70 million and 90 million pounds will be traded in 2021, up from 50 million in a typical year. </p><p>   A big question for traders and investors is whether utilities, which have been quiet in the market this year, start stocking up on uranium in anticipation of a prolonged rise in prices. </p><p>   There are tentative signs that is starting to unfold. </p><p>   Two utilities -- Tennessee Valley Authority and Argentina's Nucleoelectrica Argentina SA -- invited offers for uranium supplies on Monday, people familiar with the matter said. A third, STP Nuclear Operating Co. in Texas, asked market participants about buying fuel without an official tender, the people said. </p><p>   A spokesman for TVA said the tender was part of a routine process to determine market conditions. An STP spokeswoman declined to comment. The Argentine utility didn't return requests for comment. </p><p>   Individual traders aren't the only ones placing money on uranium. Money managers including MMCAP International and Anchorage Capital Group have bought physical fuel in a wager on higher prices, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Some uranium bulls say nuclear power will aid efforts to move away from fossil fuels, boosting demand. </p><p>   A spokesman for Sprott said family offices, hedge funds and other institutional investors have bought the majority of new units recently issued by the trust. </p><p>   Shares of a third investment vehicle for physical uranium, Yellow Cake PLC, have jumped 54% in London this year. The fund has said it expects to take delivery of 2 million pounds of uranium from Kazatomprom between October and December, taking its overall holdings to almost 16 million pounds. </p><p>   \"We've never seen this before in the uranium market,\" Amir Adnani, chief executive of Uranium Energy, said of the Kazakh and Sprott fundraisings. \"Long-term, this has to be bullish.\" </p><p></p>",
