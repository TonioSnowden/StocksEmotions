  "text": "<p>Leon Black, the former chief executive of Apollo Global Management, has been hit with a lawsuit claiming that he raped and harassed a young Russian model before manipulating her with promises of money and sham job interviews at Goldman Sachs.</p> <p>The claims, which come weeks after Black <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1390c33e-bae4-4a6d-9bcc-7af1ee5b09d5\">stepped down</a> from Apollo following scrutiny of his ties to the late paedophile <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23448802-3ee8-4c3c-bb46-fc02e304f3ed\">Jeffrey Epstein</a>, contradict Black's account of what he has characterised as a “consensual affair” with a woman who he claims later extorted him.</p> <p>Guzel Ganieva was in her early 20s when she says Black picked her out of a crowd at a New York event marking International Women's Day, and invited her to discuss her future over dinner at the upscale restaurant La Grenouille.</p> <p>She alleges that soon after that 2008 encounter, the Apollo Global Management founder took her to a bare studio apartment where, on a mattress on the floor, he subjected her to “forced sadistic sexual acts”.</p> <p>Black “derived pleasure from humiliating and debasing” Ganieva and intentionally caused her physical pain, according to a civil complaint <a href=\"https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=no8xcLqbaiXThX8NP1ETeQ==\">filed</a> in New York state supreme court on Tuesday.</p> <p>But when Ganieva indicated she was cutting off contact, she says <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/stream/72fa7bc3-8b3c-48bb-9da4-756a9b61b530\">Black</a> turned conciliatory — offering to finance a movie that she could produce, and to use his contacts to facilitate an application at Harvard Business School. </p> <p>“This frivolous lawsuit is riddled with lies, and is nothing more than a wholesale fiction,” a spokesperson for Black said on Tuesday, adding that Ganieva “had a wholly consensual relationship with [Black] for six years” and that her allegations of “harassment and other inappropriate behaviour” were “categorically untrue”.</p> <p>Black resigned from Apollo in March, citing “relentless public attention and media scrutiny” of his professional ties to Epstein, to whom he paid $158m for tax advice and art transaction services. An investigation by Dechert, the international law firm, found no evidence that Black had done anything wrong.</p> <p>Ganieva's lawsuit claims that Black harmed her reputation by making false and malicious statements in response to news reports detailing some of her allegations of sexual harassment.</p> <p>“The truth is that I have been extorted by Ms Ganieva for many years,” Black said in an April statement that Ganieva's lawyers say was “false and defamatory”. </p> <p>“I made substantial monetary payments to her, based on her threats to go public concerning our relationship, in an attempt to spare my family from public embarrassment,” the statement added.</p> <p>Ganieva's lawsuit offers a different version of events surrounding the money she received from Black, beginning with a $480,000 loan that she says he offered in June 2011 to help her resume her college studies.</p> <p>A photograph of a one-page “loan agreement” attached to the lawsuit appears to bear Black's flowing signature alongside Ganieva's, and arranges for her to receive $60,000 every three months for the subsequent two years. </p> <p>“The principal loan will be repaid in full on June 1 2016 and will carry a simple interest rate of 5 per cent per annum,” the document states, without calculating the amount to be repaid. Ganieva says she signed another, nearly identical “loan agreement” in 2013.</p> <p>With her mathematics degree finished, Ganieva began looking for work, and she says Black offered help, arranging for her to meet top executives at Goldman Sachs. Among them was <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8e062186-6fdd-11d9-850d-00000e2511c8\">Alison Mass</a>, who now chairs the investment banking division. </p> <p>A person familiar with the 2014 meetings said the bank had not interviewed Ganieva for any specific position, and that it was not uncommon to enter into open-ended conversations about potential job openings at the request of a client. Goldman declined to comment. </p> <p>In the end, no job materialised. “Given the macro environment, there are no open jobs at Goldman Sachs right now that work for/are a fit for you,” a Goldman banker wrote to Ganieva in an email, adding that a colleague “would keep his eyes open” for job openings with clients in Moscow. </p> <p>“In hindsight Ms Ganieva knows that none of these arranged interviews were meant to be legitimate,” her lawyers wrote in a court filing. </p> <p>A year after the meetings at Goldman Sachs, Ganieva says she asked Black “to leave her and her child alone, for good”. </p> <p>At a meeting at New York's Four Seasons hotel, she says Black agreed to forgive her loans, and ordered her to sign two documents without allowing her to keep a copy. She says she now understands that she signed a non-disclosure agreement.</p> <p>Afterwards, Ganieva says she began receiving regular payments from Black, but that the money stopped arriving in April. Weeks earlier Ganieva posted on Twitter that Black was a “predator” who had “sexually harassed and abused” her for many years. </p> <p>Through a spokesperson, Black has acknowledged making payments to Ganieva and said he had “advised the criminal authorities” of her activities. </p> <p>In Tuesday's legal filing, Ganieva's lawyers contended that Black was making a “pre-emptive claim of extortion” to make it harder for her to pursue legal action. </p> <p>They wrote: “He said many times to her, ‘If you do not take the money, I will put you in prison.'”</p><p>Source: Mark Vandevelde in New York 2021 'Lawsuit claims ex-Apollo CEO Leon Black sexually assaulted Russian model' FT.com 1 June.
