  "title": "Citi rings in the new year by hiking S&P 500 price target. Here's why.",
  "text": "<p>The strategists conceded that the increase was largely predicated on the 5% gain in the market over the last two months of the year.</p><p>“No doubt, the Q4 rally reflects a continuation of this past year's earnings strength. Q4 results should support the recent market action, while 2022 outlooks should generally provide comfort in follow-through, despite ongoing COVID pandemic and supply-chain concerns,” the strategists said.</p><p>The biggest risk to markets, the strategists say, is from a growth scare triggered by Fed rates hikes, COVID-19 and/or ongoing price rises, but they expect flows into equities to persist with negative real rates. Real rates are interest rates adjusted for inflation. “Per our recent investor survey, there seems to be more agreement about downside risk than upside potential. Thus, investors seem keenly aware of the issues just described,” they said.</p><p>The Citi forecast matches the Goldman Sachs outlook, with Oppenheimer having the highest Wall Street forecast for the S&amp;P 500, calling for a 5,330 finish.</p>",
