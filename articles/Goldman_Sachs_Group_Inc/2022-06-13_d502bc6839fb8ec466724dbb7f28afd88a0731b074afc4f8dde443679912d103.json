  "text": "<p>Chinese regulators have instructed foreign banks including Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and UBS to rein in pay levels. That adds pressure to lenders already struggling with a war for talent in the region. It also signals a shift in Beijing's stance on foreign banks in China. </p> <p>In the context of a nationwide push towards common prosperity, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1c218805-876b-494d-86da-1409f82bee9a\">the warning is not surprising</a>. Local finance and tech businesses pay top hires handsomely. But the average salary in these sectors remains relatively low, at Rmb201,500 ($29,940) and Rmb150,800 ($22,400) respectively. At a national level, the median disposable income stands at just Rmb29,975 ($4,400)</p> <p>The pay curb on foreign banks will help local lenders. They have been struggling to match the pay levels offered by foreign rivals expanding aggressively in China. An exodus of workers from Hong Kong has compounded the problem.</p> <p>Listings generate the largest chunk of income for global banks in China. They were anticipating strong earnings from this source after China opened its markets to foreign bank joint ventures, and relaxed regulatory requirements for initial public offerings.</p> <p>Unfortunately, IPOs have dried up. Beijing's crackdown on US listings of Chinese companies has meant they have fallen over 90 per cent by value this year. At home, local listings are losing steam — nearly two-thirds of the companies that joined the market this year now trade below the offer price.</p> <p>Chinese banks are going through a challenging time of their own. Private sector credit demand is weak as growth slows. Beijing has raised $10bn from its biggest lenders to set up a financial stability security fund. The government wants to lift that to above $100bn in the next few months to cover potential bank bailouts.</p> <p>The latest warnings mark a steady escalation of pressure on foreign banks. These have faced scrutiny on everything from qualifications of executives to their business models </p> <p>China wants to ensure that the opening of its capital markets will not be at the expense of its banks or its political aims. Foreign banks should discount expected returns on investment accordingly.</p><p>Source:  2022 'Investment banking: when in China, pay as the Chinese do' FT.com 13 June.
