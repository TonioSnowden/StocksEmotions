Inflationary pressures on the grocer's business have made these bonds and loans harder to shift to skittish investors.</p> <p>We doubt few will cry over Wall Street's masters of the universe facing the prospect of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9f1aa4c6-7aee-4d19-b13d-aa469a6ada06#comments-anchor\">lower bonuses</a>, but the unravelling of the Morrisons LBO also serves as a vivid illustration of how the excesses of the cheap-money era are coming back to bite the world's biggest banks.</p> <p>Once a dream ticket for the lenders, DD's Rob Smith and Kaye Wiggins <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b22a85ae-3d44-499c-a603-250ecb1158ef\">explain</a> how it has turned into a growing nightmare that has cost them hundreds of millions of pounds.</p> <p>Back in the boom times of 2021, Goldman tripled-down on <strong>Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice's </strong>take-private of British supermarket chain Morrisons.</p> <p>It served as the US private equity firm's M&amp;A adviser and led the financing for the deal. Goldman took on further exposure through a substantial investment in the group's preference shares, which were made through its principal investing unit's special situations fund.</p> <p>But as the market turned, Goldman and the other 15 underwriters were left holding the bag.</p> <p>These banks have taken a gross loss of more than £200mn on selling the debt this year, according to Financial Times calculations. More than £2bn of the deal's loans are still hung on their balance sheets — marking it to market leaves a further £400mn hole.</p> <p>One loan fund manager has called it “the biggest fiasco since the Boots LBO”, referring to the 2007 buyout of the UK pharmacy chain that left banks holding billions of pounds of debt as credit markets turned.</p> <p>Some bankers say there was little Goldman and others could do when the markets turned. “None of us are happy about losing money on a trade like this, but particularly given the size I really do think it's been de-risked incredibly well given the market,” said one of the deal's underwriters.</p> <p>Others are more scathing.</p> <p>“It's just very un-Goldman,” said one rival banker. “They're usually ahead when the tide starts turning.”</p> <p>Those will be hard words to hear at Goldman, where leveraged finance bankers rule the roost. Chief executive <strong>David Solomon </strong>cut his teeth working for junk bond king <strong>Michael Milken</strong> and chief financial officer <strong>Denis Coleman</strong> used to run the European debt unit that signed the Morrisons deal.</p> <p>With Morrisons' senior debt now trading at 80 pence in the pound, it would also be interesting to know where Goldman has marked the grocer's £1.3bn of riskier preference shares, which it split equally with private markets giant <strong>Ares Management</strong>. And that's before you get to the question of what CD&amp;R's equity is now worth.</p> <p>For some observers, the deal is a symptom of the sense of complacency across Wall Street that a long period of low interest rates induced.</p> <p>“It was an aggressive deal in a hot market,” said one senior debt banker. “You can see why it happened: for years there was no reward for being conservative.”</p> <h1>OneWeb/Eutelsat: ‘Ground control to Major Dom'</h1> <p>These days, <strong>Dominic Cummings</strong> can usually be found <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dominic2306/status/1549782798608785408\">fuming about the UK government</a> in his Substack newsletter or on Twitter. But not long ago, he was pulling the strings of <strong>Boris Johnson</strong>'s government and trying to execute the country's exit from the European Union.</p> <p>Among the things the UK lost access to after Brexit was the €10bn Galileo navigation system developed for the EU by <strong>European Space Agency</strong>.*</p> <p>Keen for the UK <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bcd9a379-91b2-4bf5-9cd5-f845626ef2d0\">to have access</a> to next generation space technology, Cummings found a solution: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/597f0bb4-d3d2-4d70-a972-8021dbf6f241\">pouring $500mn</a> into a bankrupt low earth orbit start-up called <strong>OneWeb</strong>.</p> <p>OneWeb, which <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8695c459-effd-4b54-8d96-69d8e614f6b4\">went bust in 2020</a> after <strong>SoftBank</strong> refused to keep injecting capital into the business, was taken out of Chapter 11 by the UK government and <strong>Bharti Global</strong>, a unit of Indian tycoon <strong>Sunil Bharti Mittal</strong>'s conglomerate.</p> <p>But, the space race isn't cheap and OneWeb's cash needs are enormous.</p> <p>OneWeb was a pioneer in building a satellite constellation of low-earth orbit, which can beam internet to the most remote parts of the world. But its technology has been leapfrogged by newer privately funded entrants such as <strong>Elon Musk</strong>'s<strong> Starlink</strong>, a unit of <strong>SpaceX</strong>.</p> <p>For what was supposed to be such a strategic move, the UK government was unwilling to keep pouring money in. Since emerging out of bankruptcy, OneWeb has raised new funds from a number of parties including SoftBank and France's<strong> Eutelsat</strong> — but the UK did not participate.</p> <p>That brings us to the news this week with Eutelsat, a legacy satellite operator, nearing a deal to buy OneWeb. The deal <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d96a7a7-bc55-442f-af90-8ffa6336c177\">will be structured</a> as a merger of equals. The hope is that Eutelsat, which the French government owns 20 per cent of, will be able to cover OneWeb's investment needs and emerge over time as a challenger to Starlink and others.</p> <p>But the deal <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2b1bdc0e-b4d1-4f6d-b8a9-a4ba09f7c04d\">raises a number</a> of complicated questions. First, shareholders — who own Eutelsat for its stable cash flow and dividends — <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/c8281f0e-75ea-46c0-acb3-67e90c35777d\">hate the deal</a>, as Lex explains. Eutelsat shares fell more than 17 per cent on Monday.</p> <p>Second, the UK government is set to retain special rights in OneWeb including on its customers and have a board seat in the combined group. With the French government also set to have a board seat, along with Mittal, the prospect for governance mishaps looms large.</p> <p>And finally, the deal means that within a short space of time the UK has lost two domestic space champions: Satellite communications group Inmarsat, which was acquired in 2019 by private equity and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4a3accce-5f97-42e2-86ed-f530720b5511\">sold to US-based <strong>Viasat</strong></a> last year pending competition approvals, and now OneWeb.</p> <p><em>*This line has been amended since original publication</em></p> <h1>Job moves</h1> <p><strong>Volkswagen</strong> chief executive <strong>Herbert Diess</strong> was ousted on Friday and replaced by <strong>Porsche's</strong> chief executive <strong>Oliver Blume</strong>.
