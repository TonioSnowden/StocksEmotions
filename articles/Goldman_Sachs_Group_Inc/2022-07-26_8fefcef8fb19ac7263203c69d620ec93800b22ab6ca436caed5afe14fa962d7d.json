  "title": "Risky IPOs Keep Large Startups Fundraising; ‘As of right now, we are in no rush to go public,' says SingleStore CEO Raj Verma",
  "text": "<p>Despite a sharp decline this year in overall venture-capital deal making, global startups between January and mid-July closed 63 Series F or later rounds—the alphabetic system used to denote successive startup funding deals—according to market researcher PitchBook Data Inc.</p><p>A decade ago, startups were generally considered ripe for an IPO after their third significant fundraising round, typically labeled Series C. In 2012, for instance, there were 63 Series F or later rounds closed over the course of the entire year, PitchBook said.</p><p>The pace of this year's late-stage funding deals is down from 2021, when a surge of investor capital lifted the number of Series F or later rounds above 200, PitchBook said. But they are roughly keeping pace with 2020, and running ahead of 2019, PitchBook said.</p><p>\"In a tough IPO market like the one we're seeing in 2022, it could make sense to hold off,\" said Brian Lee, senior vice president of data firm CB Insights' intelligence unit.</p><p>SingleStore, for instance, should be large enough for an IPO by next year, Raj Verma, the cloud-database startup's chief executive said, adding, \"As of right now, we are in no rush to go public.\"</p><p>San Francisco-based SingleStore this month announced a $116 million Series F round, led by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"We think the size we will be a year from now has the potential to be a very successful public company,\" Mr. Verma said.</p><p>He said the new capital will help advance product development and increase global market share. Since an initial seed investment in 2011, SingleStore has raised $382 million, and currently has a valuation of more than $1.3 billion, the company said.</p><p>After hitting a record high in the first three months of the year, the number of late-stage funding deals closed by U.S.-based startups in the second quarter tailed off by 10% to roughly 1,400, according to a separate report by PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association. The report defines late-stage deals as Series C or later.</p><p>Between January and the end of June, U.S. startups announced a total of 3,048 late-stage funding deals, compared with full-year totals of 5,385 in 2021 and 3,611 in 2020, the report said.</p><p>Over the same period, public market debuts \"continue to be essentially nonexistent for VC-backed businesses in 2022,\" the report said. It tracked 22 U.S. IPOs during the first half of the year, compared with 183 in 2021 and 108 in 2020.</p><p>With easy money drying up as hedge funds and other institutional investors turn to higher-yield bonds and away from investing in startups, the incentive for seeking later-stage funding appears to have changed, PitchBook senior analyst Kyle Stanford said.</p><p>\"Pre-IPO startups now want to raise extra capital as a safety net,\" he said. \"Companies are saying IPO isn't going to be this year, or even next year.\"</p><p>Dave Munichiello, general partner at SingleStore investor GV, formerly Google Ventures, said the best startups have enough capital to last well beyond their target IPOs. After an initial investment, he said, investors need to provide long-term support as a startup advances toward profitability and an exit.</p><p>\"There's always been this idea of a window for IPOs, and either the window is open or closed,\" he said. \"Right now it's closed.\"</p><p>Companies that recently closed late-stage rounds—or raised sufficient capital in last year's frothy market—are well positioned to weather tougher economic times, said Conor Moore, head of KPMG's venture-capital practice.</p><p>These startups can now \"pick a perfect time to go public, as opposed to being at the mercy of having to go public when the cash was running out,\" Mr. Moore said. But many others that have postponed IPOs will need to raise capital at some point this year, he added.</p><p>\"I would expect to see more later stage rounds in the next few months,\" Mr. Moore said.</p><p>Write to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com</p>",
