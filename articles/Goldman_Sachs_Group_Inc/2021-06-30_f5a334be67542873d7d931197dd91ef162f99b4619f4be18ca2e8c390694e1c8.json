  "title": "Optimistic Data Pull Nasdaq, S&P to Record Levels",
  "text": "<p>The Nasdaq Composite also rallied, rising 27.83 points, or 0.2%, to 14528.33, marking the technology-heavy index's 19th record close of the year.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 9.02 points, or less than 0.1%, to 34292.29. The index of blue-chip stocks remains 1.4% away from its last record close in early May.</p><p>The indexes finished the day off their session highs. Earlier in the day, economically sensitive stocks rallied after private research group The Conference Board said its index of consumer confidence rose in June, beating analysts' expectations.</p><p>The survey, which offers insight into Americans' willingness to spend on goods and services, found that consumers are optimistic about business conditions and their own financial prospects in the months ahead.</p><p>Additional housing data also added to that sentiment, with new data showing that U.S. home prices surged at their fastest pace ever in April. Shares of home builders including PulteGroup and Lennar finished higher, rising 2% and 0.8%, respectively.</p><p>Stocks have been rising in recent weeks , propelled by investors' confidence in the economic recovery and the prospect of fresh government spending.</p><p>Yet money managers also point to signs of anxiety under the surface. Many investors remain cautious about whether the more-transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus could slow the global economic recovery or disrupt supply chains for crucial goods.</p><p>Inflation also remains a top concern for investors. A Bank of America Global Research survey from June found fund managers view inflation and a bond market \"taper tantrum\" -- meaning a possible spike in Treasury yields once the Fed indicates it will tighten monetary policy -- as the top risks for the markets.</p><p>\"You're seeing the tug of war between value versus growth right now, and where it's really coming from is the tug of war between whether inflation is transitory or real,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.</p><p>Many market strategists are anticipating choppiness to continue -- especially during a week that is expected to bring muted volumes ahead of the Fourth of July weekend. Many also await Friday's jobs numbers.</p><p>Still, some analysts expect stocks to grind higher.</p><p>\"We have further to run when it comes to equities, but I think there is some form of summer lull coming and it could be that we see some zigzagging,\" said Daniel Egger, chief investment officer at St. Gotthard Fund Management, about small potential market peaks and valleys.</p><p>In corporate news, Morgan Stanley rose $2.94, or 3.4%, to $90.64. The bank on Monday doubled its quarterly dividend and said it plans to buy back up to $12 billion of its stock. Goldman Sachs gained $3.91, or 1.1%, to $372.62 after raising its dividend.</p><p>Many technology companies also rallied, with social-media company Snap gaining $1.35, or 2%, to $67.57. Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices rose $2.44, or 2.8%, to $89.52.</p><p>Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose 0.1% to $74.76 a barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies meet Thursday, when they are expected to discuss a modest increase in production.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note edged up to 1.479% from 1.478%. Yields rise when bond prices fall.</p><p>Overseas, the Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.3%.</p><p>Early Wednesday, Japan's Nikkei and Hong Kong's Hang Seng were flat and the Shanghai Composite was up 0.2%. U.S. stock futures were up 0.1%.</p>",
