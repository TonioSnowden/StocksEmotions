  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was up 626 points, or 2.1%, at 30,261 after rising 677 points at its session high.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 103 points, or 2.9%, at 3,686.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite jumped 365 points, or 3.5%, to 10,686.</p><p>Stocks experienced extremely volatile trade last week, with major indexes reversing steep losses Thursday to end sharply higher only to tumble again   on Friday. The Dow saw a 1.2% weekly fall, while the S&amp;P 500 shed 1.6% and the Nasdaq Composite lost 3.1%.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Financial-market sentiment improved on Monday as the result of better-than-expected earnings from Bank of America Corp. BAC, as well as developments in the U.K. under new finance minister Jeremy Hunt. Hunt, the new Chancellor of the Exchequer, abandoned the majority of the £45 billion ($51 billion) in previously announced unfunded tax cuts that were blamed for sparking a bout of global market volatility and stoking fears of a broader breakdown of the global financial system. That contributed to a sharp pullback on yields on the 30-year gilt BX:TMBMKGB-30Y, or U.K. equivalent of Treasurys, which fell 48 basis points to 4.37%. Two- BX:TMUBMUSD02Y through 10-year Treasury yields BX:TMUBMUSD10Y declined in sympathy with U.K. rates.

One of them is the action taken by Britain's new finance minister and the other is U.S. corporate earnings \"which have not been as bad as expected,\" he said via phone. Earnings season is set to pick up steam after a round of earnings from major Wall Street banks on Friday. Investors welcomed results Monday from Bank of America, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS is due to report Tuesday. In Monday's only major U.S. economic release, the New York Fed's Empire Statemanufacturing index had its third straight negative reading, declining 7.6 points to negative 9.1 in October, compared with expectations for a reading of negative 5. Meanwhile, last week's volatile activity had investors weighing whether stocks could continue sliding deeper into bear markets. \"Given ongoing uncertainty on the economy and on the earnings front, we think there's further downside,\" said Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede in Philadelphia, which manages $40.2 billion in assets. \"We don't think we've seen a bottom yet. In a recession-type of environment, it's typical to go through fair valuations on U.S. stocks, which we put at 3,250 for the S&amp;P 500 and which is where we are mentally marking the downside,\" he said via phone.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Bank of America shares BAC rose 6.3% after the bank topped Wall Street's earnings, revenue and net interest income expectationsfor the third quarter.</p><p>* Shares of Dow component Goldman Sachs GS rose 2.1% after The Wall Street Journal reported that the investment-banking giant is said to be planning to combine its flagship investment-banking and trading businesses into one unit, while merging asset and wealth management into another.</p><p>* Rupert Murdoch has proposed a recombination of Fox Corp.
