  "title": "Rishi Sunak Wins Vote to Become U.K.'s Next Prime Minister; Mr. Sunak, the first Hindu U.K. leader, is expected to calm markets",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Sunak's rise to the top job in Britain marks a historic moment. The grandson of Indian immigrants to Britain, the 42-year-old will be the U.K.'s first person of color and the first Hindu to lead the country. But his success will be determined by how well he manages the growing challenges to Britain's economy as high inflation and a looming recession create a sense of growing despair.</p><p>The former hedge-fund manager arrives with a mandate to bring calm to the ruling Conservative Party following a period of unparalleled chaos that will see the country run by three prime ministers in seven weeks—a first for the U.K. On Sunday night, his main rival for the job, the colorful but controversial former leader Boris Johnson, pulled out of the leadership race, citing the fact that he couldn't unite the party.</p><p>Mr. Sunak became the heavy favorite at the weekend after Mr. Johnson, the former party leader, dropped out of the race. Some of Mr. Johnson's backers—including former cabinet ministers Michael Gove and Priti Patel—came out in favor of Mr. Sunak on Monday.</p><p>Mr. Johnson, who was forced to quit as prime minister in the summer following a mutiny in the Tory party, wanted to stage a comeback just two months after leaving power once Ms. Truss' premiership collapsed. Ms. Truss, whose economic plans plunged the U.K. into financial turmoil for weeks, resigned while Mr. Johnson was on vacation in the Caribbean, prompting the politician to race back to the U.K. at the weekend to drum up support.</p><p>Following two days of frantic horse-trading, Mr. Johnson declared Sunday that he had gained enough support from Conservative lawmakers to run in the contest against Mr. Sunak but that continuing in the race \"would simply not be the right thing to do\" given that a large chunk of the Conservative Party's lawmakers weren't backing him.</p><p>Mr. Johnson, who is a deeply controversial figure in the party, added that \"you can't govern effectively unless you have a united party in parliament.\" He said 102 Tory lawmakers backed him, a number that couldn't be independently verified.</p><p>If Mr. Sunak wins, it will cap a meteoric political rise for Britain's first prime minister of Indian heritage. When he served as U.K. treasury chief, the 42-year-old former hedge-fund manager gained a reputation as a steady handed pragmatist.</p><p>This summer he complained that Ms. Truss's economic platform of leading a British economic revival through slashing taxes was \"fairytale economics,\" and would risk destabilizing British public finances and prompting a possible backlash from the markets. His warnings proved true just weeks later as Ms. Truss rolled out her program, which combined tax cuts with a large new energy subsidy program, and was dealt a humiliating setback when market turbulence forced her to retreat, and eventually resign.</p><p>Mr. Sunak's background as finance minister, when he occasionally raised taxes to keep public finances in check, as well as his recent prescient warnings about Ms. Truss' plans have earned him a reputation within the party as someone who can stabilize the markets following the turmoil of recent weeks, and as the country wrestles with double-digit inflation and slowing economic growth. On Sunday, he officially announced his candidacy pledging to \"fix our economy, unite our party and deliver for our country.\"</p><p>The U.K. Treasury is expected to outline on Oct. 31 a package of public spending cuts and possible tax increases as it looks to steady the nation's public finances. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt endorsed Mr. Sunak shortly after Mr. Johnson dropped out of the race.</p><p>The possible return of Mr. Johnson caused alarm in some quarters of the Conservative party, coming just months after 50 members of his government quit, questioning his integrity following a series of scandals. Still a sizable chunk of the Tory party pined for a return of the 58-year-old on account of his ability to win elections. The Conservative Party is polling at historic lows following Ms. Truss's botched program of tax cuts.</p><p>As a tense weekend unfolded, Mr. Sunak appeared to get more traction with several public endorsements from high ranking Tories. Mr. Johnson's support base on the euroskeptic right of the party, meanwhile, began to fray.</p><p>Several Conservative lawmakers, many of whom quit in protest at Mr. Johnson's governing style just this summer, said they wouldn't accept him as their leader, raising the prospect that Mr. Johnson wouldn't be able to control the Conservative Party even if he did return as prime minister.</p><p>\"We are not a fan club, nor are we organizing a popularity contest,\" wrote Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch, as she backed Mr. Sunak. \"We are the strongest and longest-surviving political party in the world.\"</p><p>Mr. Sunak's problem, critics say, is that he is too rich to appeal to working-class voters. That could prove problematic especially since the next prime minister will have to push through tough public-spending cuts to appease investors nervous about the nation's finances. Mr. Sunak's wife, Akshata Murty, is the daughter of an Indian billionaire businessman. Mr. Sunak is estimated to be the richest member of the House of Commons.</p><p>Mr. Sunak previously argued his rise to wealth embodies the meritocratic values of the Conservative Party. His grandparents immigrated to the U.K. in the 1960s and are originally from India. His mother ran a pharmacy in southern England and his father was a doctor.</p><p>Mr. Sunak attended an elite British private school and then went on to work for Goldman Sachs. It was while working on an M.B.A. at Stanford that he met his future wife. After a stint with a hedge fund he got into politics and was quickly identified within the party as a rising star. His early support of Brexit during the 2016 referendum, further played in his favor, helping to propel him through Conservative ranks.</p><p>Now Mr. Sunak will have to win over Mr. Johnson's supporters.</p><p>The enmity between Mr. Sunak and Mr. Johnson runs deep. Mr. Johnson appointed Mr. Sunak as his chancellor, elevating him to one of the highest positions in the country in 2020. However, after a string of scandals, Mr. Sunak resigned from Mr. Johnson's cabinet in the summer, saying they had differing views on the economy. The resignation triggered an avalanche of further resignations which eventually forced Mr. Johnson out of office.</p><p>In the race to find his successor, Mr. Johnson then privately backed Ms. Truss to take over as prime minister, rather than Mr. Sunak. Mr. Sunak was painted as a Tory traitor by many Conservative members for bringing down Mr. Johnson.</p><p>Meanwhile the threat of further scandal still hovered over Mr. Johnson. A parliamentary committee is probing whether he lied to parliament about parties being held in Downing Street during Covid-19 lockdowns. Mr. Johnson denied he did so, but the committee could suspend him from parliament for a number of days.</p><p>On Sunday, Mr. Sunak's launch was deliberately low key. There was no video and no press conference. Just a statement on Twitter. \"There will be integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level of the government,\" he wrote.</p><p>Write to Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com and Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com</p><p>Rishi Sunak Wins Vote to Become U.K.'s Next Prime Minister</p>",
