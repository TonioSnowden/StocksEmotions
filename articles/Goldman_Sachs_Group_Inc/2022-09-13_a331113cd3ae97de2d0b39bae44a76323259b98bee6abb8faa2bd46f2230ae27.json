  "title": "New York Developer Related Cos. Bets Big on West Palm Beach; More builders eye growing region as an alternative to more crowded Miami",
  "text": "<p>Related will announce on Tuesday that it is planning a new office tower, known as 515 Fern. The 25-story building will feature 456,000 square feet of office and 15,000 square feet of retail, which they expect will become the largest office building in downtown West Palm Beach.</p><p>The firm has also acquired in recent years multiple buildings within the same West Palm Beach neighborhood, bringing Related's total office square footage in the city to more than 2 million square feet and cementing its position as the biggest private commercial landowner in West Palm's downtown.</p><p>Other developers also see the city as a buddingalternative to building in more crowded Miami or the increasingly bustling city of Miami Beach. Late last year an affiliate of Starwood Capital Group, in partnership with two New York developers, purchased a West Palm Beach development site for a planned multifamily project.</p><p>Billionaire Palm Beach developer Jeff Greene is developing a pair of mixed office and luxury residential towers called One West Palm that he expects to finish in the next 12 months. The project stalled during the pandemic, when Mr. Greene said he was unsure about the demand for office space, but construction is now going full-throttle.</p><p>Related Group, the independently owned and run \"sister company\" to Related Cos., based in Miami, took control of Transit Village, a $1.3 billion mixed-use development covering 10 acres on the West Palm Beach site of the Tri-Rail train station stop.</p><p>\"With easy access to other booming cities and a growing number of national companies, we expect West Palm Beach and the surrounding areas to continue to grow rapidly,\" said Jon Paul Perez, president of Miami-based Related Group.</p><p>Related Cos. has built office, retail and residential properties in New York and other cities for decades. It is best known recently for its 26-acre Hudson Yards mixed-use development on the west side of Manhattan.</p><p>But during the pandemic, the company turned much of its attention to South Florida, and West Palm Beach in particular, where they have a 40-acre project in development.</p><p>Mr. Ross developed the West Palm Beach shopping center 20 years ago on the site of what were single-family homes. The area was populated mostly by workers who serviced the wealthy residents of Palm Beach island. Once the project was built, the part-time residents of Palm Beach didn't create enough year-round foot traffic to keep the retail going.</p><p>\"It was too seasonal from a retail standpoint and wasn't successful at all,\" Mr. Ross said.</p><p>After Macy's pulled out in 2017, Related began renovating the development, switching out some retail for residential, adding office space, and converting it into what is now known as \"The Square.\"</p><p>Now, with so many finance, tech and other businesses relocating to South Florida, Related is making West Palm Beach its beachhead in the region and betting that the state will continue to pull business from New York.</p><p>\"We saw where things were going, so we put together a program and capitalized on it,\" Mr. Ross said. \"Right now the trend of growth is really more in Florida today than in New York.\"</p><p>His bet could go wrong again if companies and new residents opt for downtown Miami or other districts over West Palm Beach. While Related is developing an office tower in Miami, and is gearing up to redevelop a historic hotel in Miami Beach, the firm is putting most of its South Florida chips on West Palm.</p><p>So far, that wager is paying off. Related's initial West Palm Beach office tower, known as 360 Rosemary, is fully leased. Tenants include BlackRock Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. and Steven Cohen's Point72 Asset Management, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>Demand has been so strong that Related said it is in the process of converting part of the parking garage in the building to accommodate more office tenants. The location of the new development is steps away from the Brightline train station that connects to Miami, and will include a covered pedestrian pathway from the station along the eastern facade of the building.</p><p>Write to Deborah Acosta at deborah.acosta@wsj.com</p><p>New York Developer Related Cos.
