  "title": "Market corrections are good buying opportunities, says Goldman Sachs — but only when this happens",
  "text": "<p>The first point is that corrections are not uncommon. Since 1928, there have been corrections greater than 10% during 62% of years. 2021 was unusual since the biggest drawdown was just 5%.</p><p>The bad news is the S&amp;P 500 SPX typically falls by an average of 15% peak-to-trough during the 21 non-recession corrections since 1950. That means, there would be more selling to come, given the S&amp;P 500 has only dropped 10% from its Jan. 3 peak. A 15% decline would take the index to 4100. The S&amp;P 500 ended Friday at 4432.</p><p>The good news is that S&amp;P 500 corrections are typically good buying opportunities. Of the 33 corrections of at least 10% since 1950, the median episode has lasted about five months, and encompassed a peak-to-trough decline of 18% — but an investor buying the S&amp;P 500 10% below its high would've gained a median return of 15% during the subsequent 12 months.</p><p>The key issue, they say, is whether the U.S. economy enters a recession. “Corrections rarely turn into bear markets unless the economy is heading into a recession,” the strategists say.</p><p>Fundamentally, say the strategists, rising interest rates are entirely the reason for the S&amp;P 500 decline. The 60 basis point rise in Treasury inflation-protected securities was matched by a similar rise in the S&amp;P 500 forward earnings per share yield, which is another way to say that price-to-earnings expectations fell. If real rates rise by another 60 basis points, the S&amp;P 500 would fall to 4000, and would drop to 3800 if real rates rise by 100 basis points, all else being equal.</p><p>There's three key factors investors should watch to see if a rebound can develop — positioning, monetary policy and earnings. None of these factors at the moment are working in favor of buyers. For example, its equity sentiment indicator typically is 2+ standard deviations below average near the bottoms of correction since the global financial crisis, but right now it's just 0.4 deviation away from average</p><p>Goldman and other major brokers including Bank of America and Deutsche Bank are busy ratcheting up interest-rate expectations. “Investors have had to adjust expectations dramatically since September, when markets priced just one 2022 hike and a more gradual QE taper. Clarity that expectations are appropriately calibrated would allow investors to increase equity risk,” they say.</p><p>Earnings is the final potential support. While fourth-quarter results have beaten estimates, the outlook has been mixed, with 52% providing guidance above expectations and 48% guiding below. That's led to the bottom-up consensus estimate for 2022 EPS being unchanged.</p><p>For now, the strategists said investors should focus on quality stocks that often are rewarded as financial conditions tighten. They ran a screen for Russell 3000 stocks with strong balance sheets, high margins and reasonable valuations that includes Moderna MRNA, Coterra Energy CTRA, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN, Louisiana-Pacific LPX and Skyworks Solutions SWKS.</p><p>They also are overweight S&amp;P 500 energy companies on a bullish outlook for oil prices, as well as being a hedge for inflation surprises and geopolitical conflict, while they downgraded financials to neutral.</p>",
