  "text": "<p><strong>Two things to start: </strong>Israeli spyware maker <strong>NSO Group</strong> has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24584247-0fd4-4826-bcac-f726ad17af58\">deemed worthless</a> to its private equity backers, just three years after <strong>Novalpina Capital</strong> bought the maker of the notorious Pegasus tool at a $1bn valuation. And the US consultancy that oversees NSO is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/72560975-5c15-4b9e-a95e-efc0c5559e98\">at risk of being ousted</a>.</p> <h2>The LBO market returns with a vengeance</h2> <p>It's far from clear whether financial markets have bottomed out as the war in Ukraine continues and the Federal Reserve hikes interest rates. Private equity dealmakers aren't waiting to find out.</p> <p>On Monday morning, DD's Antoine Gara <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac996df1-497c-42ae-a0a6-71a7595aab4a\">broke the news</a> that <strong>Thoma</strong> <strong>Bravo</strong> had struck its second large leveraged buyout in the past month, agreeing to take cyber security software company <strong>SailPoint</strong> <strong>Technologies</strong> private for $6.9bn.</p> <p>Thoma Bravo isn't alone in putting its money to work. </p> <p>Prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, <strong>Elliott</strong> <strong>Management</strong> and <strong>Robert</strong> <strong>Smith's</strong> <strong>Vista</strong> <strong>Equity</strong> <strong>Partners</strong> agreed a deal to take <strong>Citrix</strong> private for $16.5bn, merging it with an existing Vista portfolio company <strong>Tibco</strong> <strong>Software</strong>. </p> <p>Then in March, Elliott and <strong>Brookfield</strong> <strong>Asset</strong> <strong>Management</strong> won a $16bn takeover of TV ratings group <strong>Nielsen</strong>, though the activist fund <strong>WindAcre</strong> <strong>Partnership,</strong> previously <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4c69bd27-902c-4975-a895-b9c2c33bfd74\">profiled by DD</a>, has built an 18 per cent stake in opposition to the deal. Elliott's deal partner Brookfield itself agreed in April to take <strong>CDK</strong> <strong>Global</strong> private for $8.3bn.</p> <p>DD has been told by many bankers and financiers of an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/47c9ec9f-e86e-427e-8a50-34e4a6757852\">impending boom</a> in private equity takeovers as the bottleneck of deals put on hold by a plunge in markets earlier this year finally uncorks. </p> <p>A consortium of private equity buyers led by <strong>Advent International</strong> and<strong> Permira </strong>was able to raise billions in debt financing to close a $14bn takeover of <strong>McAfee</strong> in the days after Russia invaded Ukraine.</p> <p>Elliott has turned to bank financing for its takeovers of Citrix and Nielsen, signalling that syndicated debt markets in the US continue to absorb large deals — particularly for software buyouts. </p> <p>European debt markets are a dicier proposition. Banks have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0f4685ef-3e8a-420f-928d-a3a479f94813\">struggled to distribute loans</a> backing <strong>Clayton,</strong> <strong>Dubilier</strong> &amp; <strong>Rice's</strong> £6.6bn take-private of the supermarket chain <strong>Wm</strong> <strong>Morrison</strong>.</p> <p>Interestingly, though, Thoma Bravo is relying on private debt to finance increasingly large deals. <strong>Owl</strong> <strong>Rock Capital</strong>, <strong>Blackstone</strong> <strong>Credit</strong> and <strong>Golub</strong> <strong>Capital</strong> financed the company's $10.7bn takeover of <strong>Anaplan</strong> last month and its SailPoint takeover.</p> <p>This increasingly influential crop of lenders also financed the $6.2bn takeover of Vista-controlled cloud service provider <strong>Datto</strong> by its rival <strong>Kaseya</strong> on Monday, with Golub, Blackstone, Ares, Owl Rock Capital, <strong>Oak</strong> <strong>Hill</strong> and <strong>Carlyle</strong> backing the deal.</p> <p>There was one big difference on Monday between software sector rivals Thoma Bravo and Vista Equity.</p> <p>While Thoma Bravo was tapping lenders to invest from its newest fund, those buoyant financing markets helped Vista exit: it's poised to earn a $4bn windfall selling Datto.</p> <h2>Roll up, roll up: the gaming group playing M&amp;A</h2> <p>What exactly is <strong>Embracer</strong>?</p> <p>On one hand, it's a gaming giant that has leapfrogged rivals <strong>Ubisoft</strong> and <strong>CD Projekt</strong> to become the biggest gaming company in Europe by market capitalisation. </p> <p>On the other, it's a sprawling roll-up of unintegrated companies that some analysts struggle to understand.</p> <p>As tech companies around the world seek to capture a piece of what is now the largest entertainment market, Stockholm-listed Embracer has pursued a mind-boggling number of deals. </p> <p><strong>Staffan Ekström</strong>, a partner in <strong>EY</strong>'s corporate finance arm who has worked on most of Embracer's deals, told the FT's Anna Gross he believed Embracer had <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9374d5dc-849b-4619-adfa-b68cabfbe6b8\">set a dealmaking record</a> when it bought 13 companies — each from a different seller — over the course of one day in November 2020. &#xa0;</p> <p>The company, whose founder and chief executive <strong>Lars Wingefors</strong> owns a 23 per cent stake, has struck 62 acquisitions at a total value of $8.1bn since the start of 2020.</p> <p>Wingefors made his first million pounds at the age of 23, after selling his second-hand comic and video game business for shares in the acquirer,<strong> Aim-listed</strong> <strong>Gameplay.com, </strong>though he lost it one year later when Gameplay ran out of liquid funds. Wingefors bought back the business for a nominal £1.</p> <p>What has set his acquisitions spree apart from most rivals, years later, is that he has made few attempts to integrate the disparate parts of his empire.</p> <p>“The synergies are quite limited in terms of cost savings,” he told the FT, adding that he believes “it's not that difficult” to manage a complex and growing web of 112 entertainment studios across Europe. Companies struggle when they put too many layers of management in place, he argued.</p> <p>Still, it has become increasingly challenging for investors and analysts to compare Embracer's results year on year, or track its progress against peers.</p> <p>Analysts at <strong>Mirabaud Securities</strong> were bullish on Embracer until 2020, but have since pointed to the company's “M&amp;A warpath” strategy and consequent “spiralling complexity”.</p> <p>In its games division, Embracer reported 16 per cent organic growth — defined by excluding net sales from companies acquired in the past five quarters — in the third quarter of 2021. </p> <p>However, according to Mirabaud's calculations and definition, organic growth across the business was flat in the same period. </p> <p>The company rejects this assessment. “We find it difficult to understand how someone arrives at an overall flat development in Q3,” it said. “Organic growth is mainly driven by the release of new content” as well as “further operational and commercial initiatives with respect to back-catalogue management,” it added. </p> <p>For <strong>Toby Clothier</strong>, head of<strong> Mirabaud's </strong>global thematic and strategy team, the company is becoming “increasingly impossible to understand”, he tells the FT.&#xa0;</p> <p>“With the best will of the world, Lars can't know what's going on, it's impossible to keep track of the thing.”&#xa0;</p> <h2>What happens when Spacs no longer sell themselves</h2> <p>At the peak of the Spac frenzy, investors worried about missing out on Wall Street's hottest investment product and clamoured to get a slice of the action.</p> <p>Now the tables have turned. Dealmakers are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e1c8ecc-79ae-4cc9-8db7-0d81a6d9f7c0\">sweetening the terms</a> in a desperate bid to court investors for their special purpose acquisition companies and hold on to their cash, DD's Nikou Asgari reports. </p> <p>The shift in bargaining power from Spac sponsors to investors stems heavily from <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a1268b40-1a90-4c27-8a86-0c6ed756dd27#comments-anchor\">rising investor redemptions</a>. Early Spac investors can choose to withdraw their money later on if they decide the merger isn't to their liking. </p> <p>The exodus of funds, coupled with a decline in so-called Pipe — short for private investment in public equity — investment from buyout firms, hedge funds and other asset managers, has caused many deals to fall apart.</p> <p>So far this year, 19 mergers have been abandoned, compared to three in the same period in 2021.</p> <p>Bonus pools of shares for investors who don't redeem are an increasingly popular way to incentivise investors to remain in the merger. The impending <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-deals/China-s-Fosun-in-1.5bn-deal-to-sell-Lanvin-fashion-unit-to-SPAC2\">blank-cheque deal</a> for <strong>Lanvin Group</strong>, the fashion arm of Chinese conglomerate <strong>Fosun International</strong>, offers a bonus pot of 3.6mn shares that will be split among nonredeeming shareholders. </p> <p>Former <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> president <strong>Gary Cohn </strong>and <strong>Clifton Robbins</strong>, a former general partner at <strong>KKR</strong> and founder of hedge fund <strong>Blue Harbour</strong>, presented a similar term in their Spac deal to take lottery operator<strong> Allwyn</strong> public. </p> <p>Others are simply putting cash on the table. <strong>Hypebeast</strong>, the digital media and streetwear group backed by American football star/<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a6dd4d6f-6a86-48cc-992c-f8a32c64fdd7\">crypto enthusiast</a>/PR partner <strong>Tom Brady</strong> is offering loyal investors a quarterly $0.05 cash dividend per share until the deal closes.</p> <p>Such methods have had mixed results. In an attempt to entice investors in their Spac deal for weight-loss pill maker<strong> Gelesis</strong>,<strong> Pimco</strong> and Texas-based <strong>CapStar Investment Partners</strong> forfeited roughly two million of their lucrative sponsor shares to investors for free, bringing them in at a steep discount to the typical $10-per-share price. </p> <p>The deal also featured an earnout clause in which investors would receive extra shares if the company's stock price traded high enough for long enough once the merger had closed.</p> <p>Despite the terms on offer, a record 99 per cent of investors pulled their funds. Try as dealmakers might, the lure of Spacs is fading fast. </p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Elon Musk</strong> will not join <strong>Twitter</strong>'s board of directors, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/13b749d5-9434-4a07-88e3-92eb42eeb749\">reversing course</a> just days after he became the technology company's biggest shareholder and was offered the seat. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ad6cee49-4034-4d35-8228-6c51bc455624\">Here's more</a> from Lex.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Morrisons has appointed its operations development director <strong>Joanna Goff</strong> as chief financial officer as the supermarket chain prepares for a major refinancing after being <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4d990b0f-2728-4126-adee-d4111aae7a45\">taken over</a> by US private equity group <strong>Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice</strong>. She succeeds <strong>Michael Gleeson</strong>, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1f5c5f26-ec8d-4b5e-8c6e-a1062ded238e\">stepped down</a> from the supermarket chain last month.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Dechert </strong>has hired <strong>William Robertson</strong> as a partner in New York as part of the firm's expansion of its private equity and private credit groups.
