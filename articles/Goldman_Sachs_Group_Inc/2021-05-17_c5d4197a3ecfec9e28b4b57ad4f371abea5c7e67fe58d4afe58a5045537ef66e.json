  "text": "<p>Few would suggest the role of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/377547e1-e011-4b99-a340-637072abf423\">Italian prime minister</a> is easy. The occupants of the Palazzo Chigi have to contend with the usual responsibilities that go with running a large, rich country — managing the economy, responding to crises and representing the country on the international stage. They also enjoy little in the way of job security: there have been 69 Italian prime ministers since the second world war.&#xa0;Such a challenging role deserves a decent pay packet.</p> <p>The decision of the incumbent, Mario Draghi, to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2bb0d4d-29ec-48be-8660-fb39192b6caa\">waive his €115,000 salary</a> is well-intentioned and in many ways admirable. It is a savvy political move to forgo his salary as he navigates a moment of crisis in Italy, and a gesture of solidarity with the many citizens impoverished by the pandemic. Still, it would have been better not to: it risks sending the wrong message and setting an unfortunate precedent.</p> <p>Paying politicians is essential. After many years in public service and as a central banker — as well as a stint as a managing director at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8fca75b8-4535-11e2-838f-00144feabdc0\">Goldman Sachs</a> — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/383ec389-3fbe-44c5-bac9-ef61f0248f43\">Mr Draghi</a> not only has the wealth he himself has accumulated but, at the age of 73, an entitlement to pensions from both the Italian state and the European Central Bank. He has little need for the prime ministerial salary after an already successful career. His successor, however, may be far younger and less rich. Ensuring they are compensated for their time is vital to keep the highest offices open to everyone, not just the wealthiest.&#xa0;</p> <p>There is a symbolic reason, too, to insist on paying politicians even if they do not need the money. Prime ministers provide a valuable service to their country. Remuneration should not be seen as profiting from the office but as fair compensation for this work. Running a country is not a charitable act but a difficult job that deserves decent pay. While rejecting a salary can help fend off <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e7ab3009-94ae-465f-8e03-517d3f4e7d2c\">populist attacks</a>, it is corrosive over the long term and may reinforce the idea that there is something illegitimate about a political career — a dangerous notion in a democratic society.</p> <p>Britain, too, has had problems with how it pays its politicians. For many it was the level of pay — high compared with the country's average wage but low compared with the sort of jobs from which MPs are often recruited — that contributed to the 2009 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/001a2e69-ca23-30b5-b9a7-9ecb064efd95\">expenses scandal</a>. MPs topped up their salaries by maxing out their expenses claims. More recently, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67fad498-866e-45a2-8ca6-30a759de1e01\">former prime minister David Cameron's</a> involvement in a lobbying scandal has exposed an implicit bargain that politicians will be able to profit after they have left office in exchange for earlier giving up the chance to earn more in the private sector.</p> <p>An ideal solution would involve paying a higher base salary while strictly enforcing a ban on most outside interests and transparency about those that remained. That would reduce the appeal of trying to parlay a career in public service into private rewards and encourage a focus on their core duties. </p> <p>Aspiring politicians set themselves up for a life of abuse and having their own, and their loved ones', private lives routinely exposed to the public. That many still find it an appealing career demonstrates the enduring attractions of wielding political power. Yet making this the only form of recompense would mean it forever appealed only to a certain sort of person. A less extreme trade-off — politicians are unlikely ever to be remunerated as well as a younger Draghi was at Goldman Sachs — could, perhaps, attract a different type and quality of candidate. Politics is a serious and demanding business. The people who practise it should not be embarrassed for being paid accordingly.</p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this editorial comment:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/68ab4859-78ec-47b4-8107-1a4f42e32401\"><em>Reward politicians for time spent on campaign trail</em></a><em>&#xa0;/&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/68ab4859-78ec-47b4-8107-1a4f42e32401\"><em>From Toby Beresford, Bristol, UK</em></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c5c8b7d-4e42-4560-b4b7-158e5112f562\"><em>Another interpretation of Draghi's pay parsimony / From Matthew Akalusi, Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada</em></a><br></p><p>Source: The editorial board 2021 'Politicians should take their pay' FT.com 17 May.
