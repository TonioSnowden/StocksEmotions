  "title": "Musk Funding Puts Tesla Holdings at Risk  ----  By Tim Higgins",
  "text": "<p>   Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk has for years intertwined his personal business ventures with his stake in the auto maker. Using those holdings to help finance his $44 billion purchase of Twitter Inc. brings that connection to a deeper level. </p><p>   A key part of the funding plan includes borrowing $12.5 billion from loans backed by more than $62.5 billion worth of Tesla shares that Mr. Musk owns -- or about 40% of his stake at Wednesday's closing price of $881.51. Tesla and several banks have put in place rules that would require him to put up more collateral if the company's share prices fall. </p><p>   Using Wednesday's price, Mr. Musk would need to satisfy the banks with more collateral if Tesla shares were to fall 43% to around $504. </p><p>   In that case, the banks would require a rebalancing that would call for an additional $14 billion, or 28.5 million shares at that level. That's on top of the 70.9 million shares needed at Wednesday's price for the original collateral. </p><p>   Similarly, Tesla has long capped the amount Mr. Musk is allowed to borrow against his shares at 25% of the total value of the pledged stock. This suggests that if the deal used Wednesday's share price, he'd need to pony up more if those shares fell more than 20% to below $705 and Tesla enforces its policy. These arrangements mean that in certain scenarios, he could be pressured to sell Tesla shares. </p><p>   Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment. </p><p>   The overarching story of Tesla's stock has been one of growth, rising more than 18,000% since going public in 2010. But, like Tuesday, when it fell 12% as investors digested, among other things, what Mr. Musk's involvement in Twitter might mean for other parts of his empire, the stock has been highly volatile. Tesla shares are down more 20% since April 4 after he balked at joining the Twitter board, setting him on a path to bidding for the company. </p><p>   Since 2010, positive and negative stock swings of 5% or more in a single day have totaled 318, according to FactSet data, including Tuesday when Tesla fell to $876.42 a share. In that same period, Apple has seen 57 similar days while General Motors Co. had 90. </p><p>   At the end of 2021, Mr. Musk had 173 million Tesla shares, not counting his options. About half his stake was already promised as collateral for personal loans, according to the most recent public record last year. Pledging doesn't necessarily indicate that actual borrowing against those shares has occurred, the filing said. The most recent public filing in late 2020 said Mr. Musk personally owed a combined $515 million to Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. </p><p>   The business tycoon has long built his personal financial house on a complicated web of loans backed by his ownership stakes in the companies he backed, including his privately held rocket company, Space Exploration Technologies Corp. </p><p>   Tesla has previously warned investors of the risk that a stock sale by Mr. Musk to cover loans could cause share prices to fall. </p><p></p>",
