A cash reward? How about a free Bratwurst?&#xa0;</p> <p>Amid a worrying rise in new infections and a slowdown in vaccination rates, authorities are turning to ever more imaginative incentives to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/10c5954c-9dc4-4da6-acdc-37e446f49049\">encourage people to get their shots</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>The “sausage and stick” approach is being employed in the German town of Sonneberg, while the free smokes are being handed out in parts of the US — from Long Beach, California in the west to New York in the east.</p> <p>Authorities in Europe, where the total number of Covid-19 cases <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5bb73713-6587-4e2a-bf1a-3e90c0a8d35b#post-3f7792eb-d0d5-44f6-ab4a-dbcc7847866a\">passed 60m</a> today, are particularly nervous, as holidaymakers return to some of the continent's most popular tourist destinations. The UK, for example, began admitting <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6f40cf2b-661c-4ffb-8df4-ccd08a8651fb\">fully vaccinated visitors</a> from the EU and the US today.</p> <p>“<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8b18d893-ec1f-4355-af53-6e98d6c852b6\">Health passes</a>” are now required in France for cinema and theatre visits. From later this month, they will also be needed for restaurants, bars, cafés and long journeys on public transport. In Italy, a “green pass” is required for many activities, while the UK has warned clubbers that they will need a Covid pass from the end of September.</p> <p>In the US, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci has said that <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3d5499e6-1c44-47cf-aeee-e2eb90c2c257\">“things will get worse</a>” as 100m people remain unvaccinated, even as the Delta variant of coronavirus sweeps through the country. “We've really got to get those people to change their minds,” Fauci said. “Make it easy for them, convince them, do something to get them to be vaccinated because they are the ones that are propagating this outbreak.” </p> <p>Governments are facing pushback from those who oppose mandatory measures. Debate is intensifying in the UK over the use of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5622a285-fa7d-49a1-bc0e-c6ff47a8641b\">vaccine passports</a> and human rights groups have hit out at the possibility of companies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e5c4a1f8-dcbf-449d-8958-142c43a5ab9d#post-02701e27-0013-40ee-94a4-c72078fa38e1\">banning unvaccinated staff</a> from the office, as has happened in the US at companies such as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/671e3b0c-4aef-4b23-a609-a2e44d081a02\">Google and Facebook</a>. As the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac10c40a-a423-4ce1-8fa4-93e7139de288\">FT Editorial Board</a> points out, evidence suggests mandatory approaches can be successful in driving up vaccination rates, but could also risk deepening political and social divisions over Covid-19.</p> <p>The spread of more infectious variants of coronavirus and calls for booster shots are strengthening prospects for jab providers. Moderna and Pfizer, which last week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ee45a6f3-1577-4d64-bd1f-462c7440de38\">raised sales forecasts</a> for its Covid-19 shot by almost a third to $33.5bn, have both <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d415a01e-d065-44a9-bad4-f9235aa04c1a\">increased prices</a> in their latest contracts with the EU.</p> <h1>Global economy</h1> <p>Historically low interest rates, savings accumulated during lockdown and a desire for more space are driving a boom in <strong>global house prices</strong>. As the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/491a245d-4af7-4cad-b860-6ba51b86b45f\">first article in our new series</a> shows, annual growth across the OECD group of rich countries hit 9.4 per cent — its fastest pace for 30 years — in the first quarter of 2021.</p> <p>Britain's <strong>construction industry</strong> is facing a “perfect storm” of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/296d84a2-b73a-4bd0-b65b-6ef9883e6afc\">skills and materials shortages</a> at the same time as demand is growing at its fastest rate ever. Output in May was already higher than before the pandemic and it is forecast to rise by 13.7 per cent by the end of this year, according to the&#xa0;Construction Products Association. Haulage capacity has also been hit by the loss of 15,000 European drivers this year as a result of Brexit.</p> <p>The<strong> governor of Russia's central bank</strong> Elvira Nabiullina told the FT that inflation was a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb1b2f26-3121-4ecc-83ed-60d577c13c52\">long-term problem</a> for her country, signalling that the bank's tough monetary policy stance would continue. Last week, it raised its main lending rate to 6.5 per cent and forecast annual inflation of up to 6.2 per cent in 2021, indicating that rates could still rise further later this year. </p> <h1>Business</h1> <p><strong>Axa</strong>, the second-largest European insurer, has been embroiled in about 15,000 court cases with French restaurateurs over <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/491e595a-c724-4ff2-a63b-4e370bfa03cd\">business interruption policies</a> during the pandemic. The company, which today announced a doubling in underlying earnings for the first half of the year, said more than half of the restaurateurs had now expressed an interest in accepting their share of a €300m settlement.</p> <p><strong>HSBC</strong>, Europe's biggest lender, said <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/630811f7-7d6f-44fe-8937-3fdcc6bfe679\">profits grew more than fourfold</a> to $5.1bn in the second quarter, as it announced an interim dividend and cancelled provisions set aside to cover bad loans.</p> <p>The black clouds hanging over <strong>aviation</strong> <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9214f0a8-cc60-4511-be5d-4362462e1896\">seem to be finally lifting</a>, writes acting transport correspondent Philip Georgiadis. US carriers are starting to report profits as domestic traffic picks up, while European airlines are starting to rebuild their schedules. Global airlines lost $125bn in 2020 and are forecast to lose another $48bn this year.</p> <h1>Markets</h1> <p><strong>“Buy” ratings</strong> from analysts are at their <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ac24c8d6-c16a-41a2-88a8-c64cc51a0158\">highest level in 18 years</a> after a bumper US earnings season, although concerns remain over rising input costs, supply chain problems and upward pressure on wages. Max Gokhman of Pacific Life said that “the reason margins have been going up is because companies have been able to pass higher costs down to their consumers. If consumers start saying ‘hey, we're not comfortable with paying more' . . . that can be pretty disastrous, given just how stretched margins are”.</p> <p>As <strong>deals</strong> proliferate in tandem with the global economic recovery, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b905d511-edb1-425e-b3d1-3c8af73d88bc\">investors are starting to become more choosy</a> and demand better terms. “When the market is as busy as it is now and there is plenty to choose from, the companies with a harder story to tell need to offer better pricing,” said one investment executive. “Deals are still getting done. Someone is willing to take the risk. It just has to be at a better price.”</p> <p>Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at investment manager Pimco, told the FT that inflationary pressure from <strong>housing rental costs</strong> could <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/78b1d9a1-2f1b-4d3b-a930-3ac431f3c8c0\">push US interest rates higher</a>. “Owners' equivalent rent”&#xa0;is a key statistic in the calculation of the US consumer price index.</p> <h1>Have your say</h1> <p><em>BWKent</em> comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/491a245d-4af7-4cad-b860-6ba51b86b45f?commentID=effeff21-ef50-4f8e-9f99-94dc9d1e5956\">Pandemic fuels broadest global house price boom in two decades</a>:</p> <blockquote>  <p>Our current economic model has been all but dead since 2008, kept on life support by the low interest rates and almost relentless “money printing” by central banks worldwide, which has in turn inflated bubbles like that of the housing market. The apparent turbo charging of this policy in response to Covid may have averted the major crisis many feared when it first emerged, but now risks making the next crisis worse if/when the bubbles eventually burst.<br><br>What we need is a completely new way of doing things on the scale of the change brought about by the likes of FDR, as new problems require new solutions. So far though no one has yet come up with a solution and/or one that's appealed to many. Until that time comes central banks and associated governments look set to keep digging a hole and hope it caves in on their successors, not themselves. </p> </blockquote> <h1>Final thought</h1> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e6626e21-025e-4d1e-8543-c66f8ed2a55e\">The summer that changed my life</a>: Read our collection of stories from FT writers and share your own experiences of the holidays that have stayed with you.</p><p>Source: Darren Dodd 2021 'Vaccination push stepped up as infections rise' FT.com 2 August.
