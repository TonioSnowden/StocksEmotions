  "text": "<p>US stocks rallied on Monday while government bond prices fell, as investors returned to riskier assets after growth fears and high inflation left the S&amp;P 500 nursing its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ab84b8f-61a3-4c04-a9e6-bae91e98e49d\">seventh consecutive week</a> of losses.</p> <p>The broad S&amp;P gauge closed 1.9 per cent higher, with gains in every sector. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 1.6 per cent. </p> <p>Global equities have dropped this year as inflation — driven by economies reopening from coronavirus shutdowns and Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupting fuel and food prices — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/088d3368-bb8b-4ff3-9df7-a7680d4d81b2\">hit multi-decade highs</a> in many countries and central banks moved to raise interest rates in response.</p> <p>However, some investors have begun to question whether markets have now priced in enough bad news to create buying opportunities. </p> <p>Monday's advance followed a late turnround on Wall Street on Friday when the S&amp;P briefly<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ab84b8f-61a3-4c04-a9e6-bae91e98e49d\"> entered</a> bear market territory — defined as a 20 per cent drop from a recent peak — before rebounding to close 0.01 per cent higher. </p> <p>“Clients are mainly asking us about the risk of a global recession and the stickiness of inflation,” said James Ashley, head of international market strategy at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.</p> <p>“Our view is that, globally, we can't avoid a slowdown but we can avoid a recession.” </p> <p>The increased risk appetite among investors on Monday was also reflected in currency and government bond markets. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, which rises when prices fall, climbed 0.08 percentage points to 2.87 per cent. Germany's equivalent Bund yield rose by 0.07 percentage points, to 1.01 per cent.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies and which tends to strengthen during times of uncertainty, dropped 1 per cent. </p> <p>The dollar has set several <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/54f5231e-6157-4312-b3e4-a74335ca9bcc\">20-year highs</a> in recent weeks, but analysts are now querying whether the reserve currency's rally has gone too far. </p> <p>“The market has hoarded a huge amount of dollars in recent months,” Deutsche Bank strategist George Saravelos said, “leading to a very substantial dollar overvaluation.” </p> <p>Saravelos added that dollar buying in the past six months has been “equivalent to” the level of inflows seen during the 2008 collapse of Lehman brothers and the coronavirus-induced market ructions of March 2020.</p> <p>“The deterioration in global growth that is priced in [to the dollar] is not only large, but also bigger than what is priced in by other asset classes,” he said. </p> <p>The euro rose 1.2 per cent per cent against the US currency to just under $1.07, bouncing on dollar weakness and the European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a1684ff-1be3-4a3d-ba95-81f3109c9263\">signalling the end</a> of negative interest rates in the eurozone within months. Sterling added 0.7 per cent to just under $1.26. </p> <p>In European stock markets, the Stoxx 600 share index added 1.3 per cent, while London's FTSE 100 rose 1.7 per cent. UK-listed mining shares rallied after Chinese policymakers pledged new steps to support the nation's pandemic-blighted economy.</p> <p>Earlier in the session, Hong Kong's Hang Seng share index closed 1.2 per cent lower after the city of Beijing <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab665086-37e9-4be8-8292-2f9d24d1e337\">reported</a> rising coronavirus cases, increasing fears of further social restrictions under China's zero-Covid policy. The Hang Seng has lost about a tenth of its value since early March. Mainland China's CSI 300 dropped 0.6 per cent on Monday, while the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo added 1 per cent.</p> <p>Brent crude, the oil benchmark, added 0.8 per cent $113.42 a barrel.</p><p>Source: Naomi Rovnick in London and Nicholas Megaw in New York 2022 'US stocks rise and dollar falls after seven weeks of equity losses' FT.com 23 May.
