Ether ETHUSD is up 9% over the seven-day stretch to around $3,117. Meme token Dogecoin DOGEUSD logged a 14.4% gain while another dog-themed token Shiba Inu SHIBUSD is trading up 9.3% from seven days ago.</p><p>Crypto Metrics</p><p> Biggest Gainers   Price   % 7-day return  Ethereum Classic  $44.80  63.7%  ApeCoin           $13.39  57.2%  Loopring          $1.05   47.2%  Mina Protocol     $2.60   41.4%  Cardano           $1.16   39%</p><p>Source: CoinGecko as of March.24</p><p> Biggest Decliners  Price   % 7-day return  JUNO               $30.22  -24.1%  ECOMI              $0.002  -18.6%  Osmosis            $8.7    -7.8%  The Graph          $0.43   -5.3%  Arweave            $32.97  -3.5%</p><p>Source: CoinGecko as of March.24</p><p>A cooling NFT market?</p><p>Trading volumes of NFT, or non-fungible tokens, has been sharply lower than it was at its high in January. &#xa0;</p><p>The average daily transaction volume on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, stands at about 80 million so far on Ethereum in March, down more than 55% from January, according to crypto data tracking platform Dune Analytics.&#xa0;</p><p>“I think that early on, you saw lots of new entrants who were enthusiastic about this, but didn't necessarily have a grasp of the fundamentals and I think the cooling is a reflection of that,” Jordan Birnholtz, co-founder at NFT marketplace Neon told Distributed Ledger in an interview.&#xa0;</p><p>However, such cooling could be positive for the market in the long term, according to Birnholtz. “Because people are developing more realistic expectations for what the technology can do.”</p><p>Still, some investors said the NFT space may open up some investing opportunities as it showed some resilience during the crypto market downturn. “Since the beginning of the year, imagine you have a portfolio that was 50% in each of bitcoin and ether, the portfolio would be down about 17%,” said Greg King, founder and chief executive at digital asset investment firm Osprey Funds.&#xa0;</p><p>However, “if you take an NFT portfolio with just let's say the top two projects, CryptoPunks and Bored Ape (Yacht Club) with 50% each, the portfolio would be up 6% year to date,” King said in an interview this week.</p><p>Though it has yet to be proved as a long-term trend, “these are interesting situations because you can see that NFTs display a slight dislocation on the positive basis to the typical crypto performance year to date,” according to King.&#xa0;</p><p>Ben McMillan, founder and chief investment officer at IDX Digital Assets, said though such “blue-chip” NFT projects outperformed the whole crypto market, he would not recommend investors to view NFT as a “flight to safety.”</p><p>Liquidity is one of the constraining factors, McMillan said. He also pointed to the prevalence of wash trading, which refers to the scenario when an owner “sells” an NFT to another wallet that they also control, to make their NFT appear more valuable.</p><p>Wall street's crypto push?</p><p>Goldman Sachs GS executed its first over-the-counter crypto options trade, according to a statement on Monday.
