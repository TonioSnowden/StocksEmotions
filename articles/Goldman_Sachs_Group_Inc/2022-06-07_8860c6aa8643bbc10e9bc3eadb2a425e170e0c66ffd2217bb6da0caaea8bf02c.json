  "text": "<p>* West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery CL.1 CL00 CLN22 rose 91 cents, or 0.8%, to close at $119.41 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest finish for a front-month contract since March 8.</p><p>* August Brent crude BRN00 BRNQ22, the global benchmark, rose $1.06, or 0.9%, to settle at $120.57 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, its highest finish since May 31.</p><p>* Back on Nymex, July gasoline RBN22 fell 0.8% to $4.1577 a gallon, continuing a pullback after ending Friday at a record. July heating oil HON22 dropped 0.9% to $4.3206 a gallon.</p><p>* July natural gas NGN22 edged down 0.3% to close at $9.293 per million British thermal units after posting its highest finish since Aug. 1, 2008, on Monday.</p><p>Market drivers</p><p>Crude oil saw choppy price action but remained supported as demand revives with China ending COVID-19 lockdowns and as concerns remain over tight supplies given sanctions and embargoes are seen taking Russian crude off the market.</p><p>Traders will be watching weekly inventory data from the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, late Tuesday, followed by official figures from the Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.</p><p>The return of significant U.S. refinery capacity likely contributed to a seasonal bump in U.S. refined product stocks in the week that ended June 3, according to a survey of analysts by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.</p><p>The survey found expectations for EIA to show a drop of 2.9 million barrels in crude inventories, while gasoline stocks were seen up 2 million barrels and distillate inventories up 800,000 barrels.</p><p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs, in a Tuesday note, said that a \"political\" surplus created in April and May as a result of only modest Russian export declines, massive releases from strategic oil reserves by several countries, and China's COVID-19 lockdowns is already ending.</p><p>See: Goldman Sachs expects oil prices to surge to nearly $140 a barrel this summer — but it will feel like $160</p><p>Meanwhile, a decision last week by OPEC+ — the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies — to increase output did little to cool crude prices. OPEC+ agreed to raise its output target by 648,000 barrels a day in July and August, up from the 432,000 barrel-a-day increments it had previously delivered. But OPEC+ has failed to meet its production targets recently, analysts have noted, and doubt the group's ability to meet the larger target.</p><p>U.S. oil benchmark ends choppy session at 3-month high</p>",
