  "title": "Shake Shack soars as the burger chain heads to $1 billion in sales for the fourth quarter",
  "text": "<p>“With all the noise, it's easy to overlook that revenue is up 49% this quarter versus the same time last year,” said Chief Executive Randall Garutti on the late Thursday earnings call, according to the FactSet transcript.</p><p>“And in the fourth quarter, we expect to surpass $1 billion in system-wide sales for the year, a first for us. That is quite a comeback our team is making.”</p><p>Shake Shack SHAKreported an adjusted loss of 5 cents per share, ahead of the FactSet consensus for a loss of 6 cents per share. Revenue of $193.9 million fell short of the FactSet consensus for $197.5 million but was a record, according to Garutti.</p><p>Read: Feeling fleeced by pricy filets? Meat, fruit and oats lead the drought-driven surge in food costs</p><p>Shake Shack credited the return to offices, events and commuting for the revival, particularly in New York, which the company calls home.</p><p>In May, Goldman Sachs forecast that the burger chain would recover, though it could take some time due to its focus on urban areas.</p><p>“For Shake Shack long-term, we believe the balance of urban renewal and the strength and focus of our suburban models will build a solid foundation for the future,” Garutti said.</p><p>But the company acknowledged that the dual cost pressures of supply chain and labor will be challenges for the foreseeable future.</p><p>“Most of the premium ingredients we buy, such as the no hormone, no antibiotic proteins that separate us from traditional fast food, have seen significant increases in a very short period of time,” he said.</p><p>“As just one example, beef, the largest part of our basket, was up approximately 30% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year and up high single digits from just the second quarter.”</p><p>See: U.S. adds 531,000 new jobs in October as economy recovers</p><p>In mid-October, Shake Shack raised prices by 3% to 3.5%, higher than the usual 1%-to-2% annual rise.</p><p>“With digital engagement increasing and digital sales sustaining, even as in-store ordering recovers, we remain confident that Shake Shack's sales opportunity has improved during COVID,” wrote Truist analysts in a note.</p><p>“Also, despite headwinds, Shake Shack's accelerated development plan appears on track.”</p><p>Truist rates Shake Shack stock buy with a $100 price target, up from $90.</p><p>Don't miss: Starbucks to launch a new Almondmilk Latte for the holidays</p><p>But other analysts are more cautious. Raymond James analysts maintained their underperform stock rating, saying the long-term picture is fuzzy due to margin headwinds and high valuation is a risk.</p><p>MKM Partners maintained their hold stock rating and $83 fair value estimate.</p><p>“With many near-term issues beyond management's control, investors are left to determine their priorities between the near-term hurdles and the company's long-term growth potential,” analysts said.</p><p>And Stifel also maintained its hold stock rating and cut its price target to $75 from $85.</p><p>“We remain torn over Shack Shack's growth potential and its current weak margin structure,” analysts led by Chris O'Cull said.</p><p>“On the one hand, we see the company as a brand with proven global appeal trading at a $3 billion enterprise value; in that sense, it is hard to envision the current $3 billion enterprise value as anything short of a bargain for a global brand. On the other hand, the company struggles to sustain a healthy margin profile at the store or corporate level.”</p><p>Analysts say they believe in the long-term prospects but are wary of profit volatility.</p><p>Shake Shack shares have gained 9.6% for the year to date while the S&amp;P 500 index SPX is up 25% for the period.</p>",
