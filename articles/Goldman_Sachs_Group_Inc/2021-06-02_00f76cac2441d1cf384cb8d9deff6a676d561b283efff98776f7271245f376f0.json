The call to action comes as Republicans attempt to curb access to voting in many US states they control, including Georgia, Florida and Texas, which critics see as a campaign to limit election participation among black and Hispanic people.</p> <p>The White House has also pushed for new measures to curb the racial wealth gap in the US, including a crackdown on discrimination in home appraisals and a $100bn boost to federal contracts for small businesses in disadvantaged communities.</p> <p>The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis <a href=\"https://www.minneapolisfed.org/events/2021/racism-and-the-economy-focus-on-entrepreneurship\">will host a conference today</a> on the impact of racism on entrepreneurs.
