  "text": "<p>The move mirrored a similar-size increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve in the federal funds rate the previous week.</p><p>Most Bank of Mexico board members noted a high level of uncertainty over the time it will take for price shocks such as those in energy and global commodities to fade, and said further shocks couldn't be ruled out, according to the minutes.</p><p>Several expressed concern that longer-term inflation expectations continue to rise, which risks fueling broad and sustained price increases.</p><p>Mexico's National Statistics Institute said Thursday that inflation rose to 7.99% in June from 7.65% in May, while core inflation—which excludes energy and agricultural products but includes processed food—rose to 7.49% from 7.28%.</p><p>The central bank said it intends to continue raising the overnight rate, with the possibility of further three-quarter-point increases, if needed, to bring inflation back to its 3% target.</p><p>One member called for a commitment to another increase of that size at the next meeting in August, while others saw the need to assess the possibility if warranted, according to the minutes of the meeting.</p><p>Another member warned against excessive monetary tightening on grounds it could be counterproductive for financial and economic stability, and said the central bank has room to eventually reduce the spread between Mexican and U.S. reference rates.</p><p>The minutes were \"slightly dovish,\" Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s chief Latin America economist, Alberto Ramos, said in a note, with \"only one director arguing clearly and unequivocally that the next move should be 75 basis points.\"</p><p>Twenty-eight of the 33 banks polled this week by Citigroup Inc. unit Citibanamex expect the Bank of Mexico to make another three-quarter-point increase in August. But the minutes show such a move \"isn't a foregone conclusion,\" Mr. Ramos said.</p><p>The Bank of Mexico raised its inflation forecasts for this year and most of 2023, while still expecting inflation to return to its 3% target in the first quarter of 2024.</p><p>Economists surveyed by the central bank in late June increased their median year-end inflation estimate to 7.5% from 6.81% the previous month while projecting core inflation to end the year at 6.88%, up from 6.38% previously.</p><p>Write to Anthony Harrup at anthony.harrup@wsj.com</p><p>Bank of Mexico Minutes Show Board Open to More 0.75-Point Rate Increases</p>",
