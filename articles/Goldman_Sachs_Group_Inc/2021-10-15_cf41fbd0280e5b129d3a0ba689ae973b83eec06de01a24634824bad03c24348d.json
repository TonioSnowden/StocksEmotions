  "text": "<p>In another bright spot, the bank's global markets revenue turned in a particularly strong beat of analyst projections, and the banks assets under management set a fresh record.</p><p>The bank also forecast an “increased likelihood” of monetary policy tightening in the near term due to inflationary pressures. Any rate hikes are seen as beneficial to lenders that have seen their loan margins pressured by low interest rates.</p><p>CEO David Solomon said the firm “saw strong operating performance” and that its “opportunity set continues to be attractive across all of our businesses.”</p><p>Goldman Sachs GS shares rose 1.7% in morning trades, enough to be the top performer among the Dow Jones Industrial Average's DJIA components.</p><p>The Wall Street giant said its net income rose to $5.28 billion, or $14.93 a share, from $3.23 billion, or $8.98 a share, in the year-ago period.</p><p>Net revenue increased to $13.6 billion from $10.8 billion. Net interest income climbed to $1.56 billion from $1.08 billion.</p><p>Goldman Sachs soundly beat the consensus analyst estimates for earnings of $10.14 a share and revenue of $11.72 billion, according to a survey by FactSet.</p><p>Goldman's investment banking unit nearly doubled its revenue to $3.55 billion from $1.93 billion, and ahead of the analyst estimate of $2.6 billion.</p><p>The firm's global markets revenue increased to $5.61 billion from $4.55 billion. The latest figure blew past the FactSet estimate of $3.70 billion.</p><p>During the third quarter, Goldman Sachs repurchased $1.0 billion of stock. Its headcount at the end of the third-quarter was 43,000, up 5.4% from the end of the second quarter.</p><p>Its third-quarter provision for credit losses of $175 million compared with $278 million a year ago.</p><p>Assets under supervision increased $67 billion during the quarter to $2.37 trillion, a record. Firmwide management and other fees of $1.95 billion also set a record.</p><p>Turning to M&amp;A, Goldman acquired two businesses in the quarter: NN Investment Partners and GreenSky Inc. Both deals are expected to close by the end of the first quarter.</p><p>Goldman Sachs shares are up 48.3% so far this year, compared with an increase of 18.2% by the S&amp;P 500 SPX and a rise of 38% by the KBW Bank Index BKX.</p>",
