  "text": "<p>Meanwhile, New York Fed President John Williams, a key ally of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, said Friday that he expects economic growth to slow in 2022 to a 3.5% annual rate, from an estimated 5.5% rate last year, amid the spread of omicron.</p><p>What are stock indexes doing?</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA dropped almost 382 points, or 1.1%, to about 35,732, weighed by declines in shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM and American Express Co.AXP</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX gave up 28 points, or 0.6%, to trade around 4,631.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP was down 38 points, or 0.3%, at about 14,769, after flipping between gains and losses in earlier trade.</p><p>On Thursday, the Dow fell 177 points, or 0.49%, to 36114, the S&amp;P 500 declined 67 points, or 1.42%, to 4659, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 382 points, or 2.51%, to 14807.</p><p>What's driving markets?</p><p>Sentiment on Wall Street appeared to be souring to end a tumultuous week of trade that started off with a fall for yield-sensitive areas of the market, such as information technology stocks, followed by an unexpected series of gains, despite heightened anticipation for higher interest rates and overall tighter financial conditions.</p><p>Concerns about the near-term economic outlook and a bumpy rotation from highflying stocks to cyclicals appeared to be contributing to Friday's volatility.</p><p>“I expect the current omicron wave to slow growth in the next few months as people once again pull back from contact-intensive activities,” New York Fed President John Williams said Friday in remarks to the Council on Foreign Relations.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Commerce released data Friday showing retail sales&#xa0;dropped by 1.9%&#xa0;in December, exceeding the 0.1% decline forecast by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>“Consumer price inflation could be weighing on retail spending,” along with the rapid spread of the omicron variant, said Giorgio Caputo, head of the multi-asset value team at J O Hambro Capital Management, in a phone interview Friday. “It's always very hard to figure out what keeps people away from purchases.”</p><p>Some of the sharp decline in retail sales in December may be the result of households getting an earlier jump on their holiday shopping in October due to concern over “goods shortages and shipping delays” in the pandemic, Barclays said in an economics research report Friday.</p><p>“Adverse effects on spending from the omicron variant” may also have contributed to the drop, including in categories such as restaurants and in-store purchases, said Barclays. “Inflation-adjusted (real) disposable incomes of households have been trending lower in recent months,” possibly hurting spending.</p><p>In his remarks Friday, New York Fed President Williams predicted inflation will ease from its current brisk pace. “With growth slowing and supply constraints gradually being resolved, I expect inflation to drop to around 2.5% this year,” he said.&#xa0;</p><p>Federal Reserve Gov. Christopher Waller on Wednesday suggested that as many as five interest-rate increases are a possibility in 2022 as the central bank aims to beat back rampant inflation. Though the policy maker said his baseline expectation was for three rate increases on the year.</p><p>Meanwhile, a closely followed gauge of U.S. consumer sentiment fell to 68.8 in January from 70.6 in the prior month, marking the second-lowest reading in a decade, with omicron concerns partly attributed to its drop-off.</p><p>Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, said that the fall in consumer sentiment reflects the pain lower-income Americans are facing amid inflation.</p><p>“January's Consumer Sentiment reading starkly underscores how high inflation hurts lower-income households most,” he wrote in emailed comments.</p><p>“Sentiment fell sharply for households earning less than $100,000, but rose for those earning above that level. Especially with energy and food prices so high, which take up a much higher percentage of lower-income budgets than other expenses, financial stress is mounting on the 70% of U.S. households below the $100,000 threshold,” he said.</p><p>In other economic data, U.S. industrial output fell 0.1% in December after a revised 0.7% gain in the prior month and industrial-capacity use edged down to 76.5% last month versus 76.6% in prior month.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Banks including JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM and Wells FargoWFC each reported stronger fourth-quarter earnings than forecast. CitigroupCposted a decline in its quarterly profit. Citi's shares were down around 2%, those for Wells Fargo were up 2.4% and JPMorgan Chase's stock was down 6.2%.</p><p>Asset manager BlackRockBLK reported that its assets under management reached $10 trillion. However, the firm's stock was down 3.4%.</p><p>Shares of paint-maker Sherwin-Williams SHWwere down 3.4% after it lowered its guidance, citing supply shortages.</p><p>Tesla's stockTSLA was in focus after its CEO, Elon Musk, said the electric-vehicle maker would accept meme asset dogecoinDOGEUSD as payment for some merchandise. Shares of Tesla fell 0.8% while dogecoin changed hands at 18.7 cents, up about 10.2%.</p><p>Shares of Google parent AlphabetGOOGGOOGLwere in focus after The Wall Street Journal reported that Google misled publishers and advertisers for years about the pricing and processes of its ad auctions. Alphabet's Class A shares were up 0.3%.</p><p>How are other assets faring?</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury note&#xa0;TMUBMUSD10Y&#xa0;rose about 6 basis points to around 1.77%. Yields and debt prices moved opposite each other.</p><p>The ICE U.S. Dollar Index&#xa0;DXY,&#xa0;a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was up 0.4% Friday for a weekly decline so far of 0.6%.</p><p>Oil futures&#xa0;CL00 for West Texas Intermediate crude were up 2.2% at $83.89 a barrel after ending Wednesday at a two-month high.
