  "title": "Owner of Bankrupt 737 MAX Supplier Tect Challenges Boeing's Legal Release; Stony Point Group takes issue with legal protection the aerospace giant is getting in Tect's chapter 11 liquidation",
  "text": "<p>Stony Point asked that language be added to the disclosure statement ahead of creditors' vote on the liquidation plan, stating that parties that aren't getting broad legal protection, including the family-office owner itself, reserve the rights to pursue Boeing for harm they say it caused Tect. The disclosure statement is up for court approval next week.</p><p>Boeing was \"inextricably linked to the chain of events that led to the ultimate demise\" of Tect, according to papers filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.</p><p>A Boeing representative didn't comment Wednesday about the filing.</p><p>Boeing provided roughly $60 million in bankruptcy financing to Tect at the time of the filing early last year and said then that it was the only lender to come to Tect's rescue.</p><p>Shortly after, Boeing accused owners of Tect of raiding the company's assets and demanded a stake in possible commercial tort claims against Tect's directors and officers for potentially breaching their fiduciary duties.</p><p>Judge Karen Owens of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., said nearly all of the terms Boeing was requesting were reasonable and appropriate, including its request for an interest in potential claims against Tect insiders.</p><p>Tect has said the Covid-19 pandemic's impact on airline industry purchasing also partly led to its chapter 11.</p><p>A faulty flight-control system sent two 737 MAX jets into fatal nose dives in late 2018 and early 2019. The crashes took 346 lives and led to a world-wide grounding of the aircraft for nearly two years.</p><p>The MAX crisis has cost Boeing around $20 billion in lost production, compensation and related charges and provisions.</p><p>As a result, Tect's revenue in 2020 related to the 737 MAX was down 83% from the previous year. In 2019, more than a third of Tect's sales were related to the sale of parts for the 737 MAX to Boeing and to another Boeing supplier.</p><p>Tect parts are used in flight controls, fuselages and other sections of civilian and military aircraft world-wide.</p><p>Tect, based in Wichita, Kan., sold its Kansas operations to Boeing as part of the bankruptcy. Assets in Everett, Wash., were sold to another company.</p><p>Andrew Tangel contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Becky Yerak at becky.yerak@wsj.com</p>",
