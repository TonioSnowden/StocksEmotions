  "text": "<p>   Boeing Co. resumed deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner, a step toward moving past production problems with the wide-body jets. </p><p>   A United Airlines Holdings Inc. spokeswoman said the Chicago-based carrier received a 787 on Friday and expected a second as soon as Monday. </p><p>   The plane maker had halted deliveries of the popular jets in October after a series of production quality lapses. The problems have prompted stepped-up regulatory scrutiny and hindered Boeing's ability to generate cash amid the Covid-19 pandemic, which has hurt demand for air travel and the airplanes it produces. </p><p>   A Boeing spokesman declined to comment on the pace of deliveries for the company's backlog of Dreamliners, which it has moved to produce at a rate of five airplanes a month. Since halting deliveries in October, Boeing has built up an inventory of more than 80 finished planes, according to aviation data provider Ascend by Cirium. </p><p>   The Boeing spokesman said the company thoroughly examined many aspects of the 787 program to ensure newly delivered airplanes \"meet all regulatory requirements and Boeing's highest quality standards.\" </p><p>   The Dreamliner production lapses spurred a broad review by the Federal Aviation Administration. </p><p></p>",
