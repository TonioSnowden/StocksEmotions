  "title": "Business News:  NASA Moon  Project Sets  Race for Bids  ----  By Micah Maidenberg",
  "text": "<p>   The Biden administration's proposed new funding for NASA's lunar aspirations will draw several companies to bid for projects, including a second moon-lander vehicle that would compete with an already-awarded effort from SpaceX. </p><p>   The bidding for a second lander vehicle is likely to draw proposals from companies such as Blue Origin, which was part of the team that didn't win NASA funding under the agency's previous contracting effort. \"Blue Origin is ready to compete,\" the company said. </p><p>   NASA has been pushing to take astronauts, for the first time in decades, back to the lunar surface. This year the agency plans to test its Space Launch System, a massive rocket developed by companies including Boeing Co., by using it to blast a spacecraft built by Lockheed Martin Corp. around the moon. </p><p>   The White House budget request includes roughly $1.5 billion in funds for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration moon-lander program, according to materials the space agency released Monday. For its previous fiscal year, the agency received about $1.2 billion for those efforts, a spokeswoman said. </p><p>   The uncrewed launch would serve as a prelude to a mission slated for 2025, when SpaceX would take two astronauts on its lander in lunar orbit and transport them to the moon's surface, NASA has said. </p><p>   NASA about a year ago selected a Starship vehicle built by SpaceX to initially handle that mission, awarding the company a $2.9 billion contract. SpaceX beat out proposals from a team including Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin LLC, as well as from Dynetics, a unit of Leidos Holdings Inc., which handles a range of projects for defense and other government customers. </p><p>   The space agency has said SpaceX's award was a first step and last week confirmed it would solicit proposals from companies other than SpaceX to build a second lander. </p><p>   NASA officials declined to break out how much funding would be applied to the new lander bidding, saying that specifying a sum could alter how the procurement works. </p><p>   Congress appropriates how much government agencies have to spend, so the final NASA budget could be different than what the White House requested. </p><p>   \"We think, and so does the Congress, that competition leads to better, more reliable outcomes,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a briefing last week. \"I promised competition, so here it is.\" </p><p>   A spokesman for Leidos said the company looks forward to reviewing the agency's forthcoming request for proposals. A Boeing spokeswoman said the company continually evaluates contract opportunities for NASA missions. Boeing submitted a lander proposal during an earlier part of the procurement round that SpaceX ultimately won, according to a NASA document. </p><p>   In addition to seeking proposals for a second lander, NASA officials said last week the agency would give Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the formal name for Elon Musk's SpaceX, more work landing people on the moon under its existing contract. </p><p>   Working with NASA to get astronauts to the lunar surface is a high-profile job space companies and executives have tracked closely. NASA has been building toward returning to the moon as part of its Artemis program, hiring space enterprises and aerospace contractors to create vehicles and infrastructure for such flights. </p><p>   NASA said in a procurement document last year it had a longstanding strategy to choose two winners to handle moon-lander missions, but budget constraints prevented the agency from taking that approach. Instead, as a first step, it chose to begin to work with SpaceX, which had proposed the lowest initial price as part of that bidding, the document said. </p><p></p>",
