  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Boeing Settles With Air Force One Subcontractor  ----  By Becky Yerak",
  "text": "<p>   Boeing Co. has settled its differences with GDC Technics LLC, a bankrupt supplier of products and services for Air Force One that filed for chapter 11 over contract disputes involving the presidential plane. </p><p>   Boeing and its Air Force One subcontractor GDC will \"resume customary business interactions\" when the Fort Worth, Texas-based company restructures its finances and leaves chapter 11, according to settlement papers filed Thursday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Antonio. </p><p>   The proposed settlement clears the way for GDC to leave chapter 11, where the aircraft modification and technology business sought protection in April, alleging that Boeing had caused delays on contracts to supply Air Force One and failed to pay for work. </p><p>   Each company blamed the other for contract delays. Boeing said it was a major creditor of GDC, filing a $314 million claim in the chapter 11 case, dwarfing all other claims against the company. </p><p>   Under the agreement filed Thursday, Boeing will restart discussions with GDC about supplying products for its aircraft. The aerospace giant will also consider providing technical support again to customers that do business with GDC \"so long as GDC is operating in compliance with its licenses and other agreements with Boeing,\" the court filing said. </p><p>   The settlement provides that Boeing take a steep discount and will be allowed a claim of $73.9 million, payable from a trust for unsecured creditors that will have at least $11.5 million in cash in it. But most of Boeing's claim will be lower in the pecking order than other unsecured creditors, documents show. Whatever proceeds Boeing does receive will be returned to GDC, records show, with half of that amount flowing to the other unsecured creditors. </p><p>   Deborah Kovsky-Apap, a lawyer for GDC's unsecured creditors, said Friday the settlement avoids the risks and expenses of lengthy litigation, and clears the path for creditors to start recovering some of their claims. </p><p>   GDC is now poised to exit bankruptcy under the control of its top backer MAZAV Management LLC, which Boeing has previously accused of running the business like a \"piggy bank\" for the benefit of insiders. </p><p>   Lawyers for GDC, MAZAV and the unsecured creditors committee said in July that unsecured creditors are recouping some of what they are owed ahead of MAZAV. A lawyer for MAZAV said at the July hearing he believes that Boeing wanted to derail approval of the exit plan. </p><p>   MAZAV under the bankruptcy plan will take 100% equity control of the business, in return for forgiving $1 million in senior debt. The chapter 11 plan would also guarantee at least $11.5 million for unsecured creditors who back it. </p><p>   Boeing has accounted for a majority of GDC's business, with the relationship dating back to at least 2016. </p><p>   Boeing hired GDC to design and build interiors for Boeing's program for the Indian head of state, to make certain maintenance upgrades on Air Force One, and to design and build the interiors of two new presidential aircraft. The companies sued each other in April over setbacks on the Air Force One project. </p><p>   GDC shortly thereafter filed for bankruptcy, alleging that it was owed more than $30 million by Boeing. Later in September, GDC is scheduled to seek approval of its restructuring plan, with Boeing's support. </p><p></p>",
