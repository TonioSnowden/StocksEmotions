  "text": "<p>After U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor read the verdict, Mr. Forkner became emotional as his lawyers put their arms around him. Crying, he smiled and hugged his wife who was in the courtroom with other supporters.</p><p>Mr. Forkner, 50 years old, declined to comment. His attorneys said they were grateful to jurors for their independence in weighing the Justice Department's case. \"They saw through it, and we're very grateful,\" said David Gerger, one of Mr. Forkner's attorneys.</p><p>A Justice Department spokesman said the agency stands by prosecutors and law-enforcement officials' efforts to investigate and try the case. \"While we are disappointed in the outcome, we respect the jury's verdict,\" the spokesman said.</p><p>Mr. Forkner has been the only person charged in relation to the crashes, seen as part of the Justice Department's effort to hold individuals accountable for their roles in corporate misdeeds.</p><p>Mr. Forkner's attorneys had argued federal prosecutors targeted him as a scapegoat for the accidents, which claimed 346 lives. They noted Mr. Forkner wasn't an engineer and that many others were involved in the flight-control system's design and certification.</p><p>The trial started Friday in a federal courthouse here and was shorter than expected. Mr. Forkner's attorneys called a single witness, a current Boeing pilot, who testified on Wednesday before closing arguments.</p><p>The jury had few reservations about their verdict, according to one juror, who declined to provide his name.</p><p>\"There was a bit of discussion about what more he could have done,\" the juror said of Mr. Forkner's communication with the FAA. The government ultimately provided \"very little evidence to support\" its claim that Mr. Forkner intentionally sought to deceive his FAA counterpart.</p><p>\"We saw it as more a corporate and regulatory failure of communication,\" the juror said.</p><p>Mr. Forkner was the company's chief technical pilot for the 737 MAX during the airplane's development. He was responsible for training materials and pilot manuals for the aircraft. He left Boeing in 2018 to work at Southwest Airlines Co., which he left in 2020.</p><p>Federal prosecutor Mike O'Neill had accused Mr. Forkner of tricking Stacey Klein, his FAA counterpart, into approving lighter training requirements to avoid costing Boeing tens of millions of dollars.</p><p>Mr. O'Neill said Mr. Forkner learned that the automated cockpit feature, known as MCAS, had been expanded to also activate in low-speed flying conditions but failed to tell Ms. Klein and then sought to cover up his deception.</p><p>\"It's lies for money, plain and simple,\" Mr. O'Neill said. The prosecutor said Mr. Forkner chose to manipulate Ms. Klein, knowing the professional consequences for himself and financial consequences for Boeing.</p><p>Boeing initially designed the 737 MAX's MCAS system to activate during certain high-speed maneuvers that pilots would rarely encounter so the aircraft would meet certification requirements.</p><p>But during the aircraft's development, company engineers decided they would need to expand the system's authority to push down the plane's nose in certain low-speed conditions, too.</p><p>Accident investigators blamed MCAS for sending two 737 MAX jets into fatal nosedives in late 2018 and early 2019. The crashes prompted a nearly two-year grounding of all 737 MAX planes, disrupting the global aviation industry.</p><p>In addition to the Justice Department's criminal investigation, it also led to congressional and regulatory investigations and a new federal law aimed at strengthening oversight of plane manufacturers.</p><p>Defense attorneys said Mr. Forkner never learned that MCAS's authority had been expanded to lower speeds, arguing he had been kept in the dark by Boeing engineers and test pilots responsible for designing the automated cockpit feature and building the aircraft.</p><p>In a settlement with the Justice Department, Boeing last year agreed to pay $2.5 billion to resolve charges that its employees misled the FAA. The deal included a $244 million fine as well as almost $2.3 billion in compensation to airline customers and families of the crash victims.</p>",
