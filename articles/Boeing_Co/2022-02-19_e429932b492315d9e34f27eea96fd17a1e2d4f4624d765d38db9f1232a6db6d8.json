  "text": "<p>\"Further reducing our international flying this summer is a difficult decision, but ultimately, it's the right one for our team members and customers,\" American said.</p><p>The Dreamliner delays have hindered American's plans to restore its international traffic this coming summer. Airlines are hoping that the receding Omicron variant and easing global travel restrictions will mean a rebound in long-haul flying, which has slumped during the pandemic.</p><p>Boeing said it deeply regrets the impact to its customers as it works through a comprehensive process to resume deliveries.</p><p>The plane maker has largely halted handing over the wide-body jets to its customers since October 2020 as it addresses a series of manufacturing flaws.</p><p>American, which had originally planned to have 13 new Dreamliners for this summer's schedule, first trimmed its plans in December but had planned on flying passengers with four new 787s that it had expected to receive in the spring.</p><p>Now, the Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier is removing those remaining four new Dreamliners from its summer schedule, according to one of the people familiar with the decision.</p>",
