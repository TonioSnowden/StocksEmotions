  "title": "Boeing Makes New Offer to St. Louis-Area Workers, Delaying Strike; Union representing about 2,500 defense-plant employees to vote Wednesday on the proposal, averting a work stoppage Monday",
  "text": "<p>Boeing said it was hopeful that workers will accept the new offer, which addressed issues employees had previously raised during negotiations. The contract dispute has largely focused on retirement benefits for the St. Louis-area workers.</p><p>The company's proposed three-year contract offers new workers an $8,000 lump-sum payment and scraps earlier plans to cut company contributions to employees' 401(k) savings plans. A strike could start Thursday if employees reject the proposal.</p><p>Boeing on Wednesday said its second-quarter results showed it was making progress in stabilizing its operations after a series of quality issues dragged down results in its commercial aviation business. The results included a series of one-time charges, including some tied to cost overruns in its defense business.</p><p>Write to Drew FitzGerald at andrew.fitzgerald@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing Makes New Offer to St. Louis-Area Workers, Delaying Strike</p>",
