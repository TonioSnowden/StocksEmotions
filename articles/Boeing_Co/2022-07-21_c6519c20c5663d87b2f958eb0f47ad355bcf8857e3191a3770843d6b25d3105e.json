  "title": "Boeing to Lift Dreamliner Output  ----  By Andrew Tangel and Benjamin Katz",
  "text": "<p>   FARNBOROUGH, England -- Boeing Co. is preparing to increase production of its 787 Dreamliner soon after U.S. air-safety regulators allow the aircraft to resume deliveries, according to a person close to the manufacturer. The company expects deliveries to restart as soon as this summer. </p><p>   The U.S. plane maker will likely ramp up to producing three of the wide-body jets a month, up from the current rate of about one, with a bump to five about six months later, the person said Wednesday on the sidelines of the Farnborough International Air Show near London. Further increases will depend on demand for the wide-body jets, the person said. </p><p>   Orders announced at the show by Boeing have provided a sense of momentum for the company, which has trailed its European rival, Airbus SE, in orders for narrow-body jets in recent years. The U.S. plane maker has been dealing with various production and regulatory problems, including with its wide-body jets where it has led its rival in orders. </p><p>   Boeing hasn't been able to deliver Dreamliners for much of the past two years as its engineers have addressed various production defects. The jets are popular among airlines, which often use them for long-haul international flights. </p><p>   Regaining the ability to hand over 787s to customers will likely boost the company's cash flow and relieve frustration with airline customers that have wanted the planes to meet resurgent demand for international travel. </p><p>   Acting Federal Aviation Administration chief Billy Nolen declined to predict when the agency's review of the 787 would conclude. A recently announced inspector general's audit into regulators' oversight of 787 production wouldn't slow the review, he said. \"Safety always dictates our timeline,\" Mr. Nolen said Wednesday after speaking at the air show. \"We have got a strong team of committed FAA employees who are working through this very purposefully.\" </p><p>   Boeing has previously said it would gradually increase to producing five 787s a month after deliveries resume, but the timing of the increases hasn't been clear. Stan Deal, the company's commercial airplanes chief, said earlier this week 787 deliveries could resume \"very soon,\" though the FAA controls the timing. </p><p>   Increasing production will also help suppliers plan for hiring and providing their components to Boeing. </p><p>   Howmet Aerospace Inc. Chief Executive John Plant said the maker of 787 parts would likely raise its own hiring and production once Boeing increases its Dreamliner output. The company has lost revenue and had to lay off staff as a result of the 787 slowdown. </p><p>   \"It will be great if that started being delivered again and then production started to increase, because it's been pretty miserable,\" Mr. Plant said. </p><p>   Boeing said Wednesday it had signed a preliminary agreement to provide Azerbaijan Airlines with four of the wide-body aircraft, increasing its fleet to 10. The plane maker on Tuesday agreed to sell an additional five 787s to leasing company Aercap Holdings NV. </p><p>   Boeing has also signed many deals for its smaller 737 MAX, including orders for as many as 130 for Delta Air Lines Inc. and commitments for up to 66 from 777 Partners, a Miami-based investment firm. </p><p></p>",
