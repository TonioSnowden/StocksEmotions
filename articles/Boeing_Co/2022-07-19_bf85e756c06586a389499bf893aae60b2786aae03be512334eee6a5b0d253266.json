  "text": "<p>Nevertheless, the order would boost Boeing's 787 Dreamliner program. Deliveries of the wide-body jets have been on hold for much of the last two years as the plane maker resolves various production issues with U.S. air-safety regulators. Boeing commercial airplanes chief Stan Deal said earlier this weekthe company was \"very close\" to resuming deliveries.</p><p>Separately, Boeing on Tuesday said it struck a deal to sell 30 of its 737 MAX jets to a private-investment firm that will place the single-aisle jets with discount carriers. The deal comes with a commitment by the customer, 777 Partners, to buy up to 36 more.</p><p>Miami-based 777 Partners has placed aircraft with carriers such as Canadian discount carrier Flair Airlines Ltd.</p><p>The deal is for the 737 MAX 8 variant of the family. On Monday, Delta Air Lines Inc. said it would buy 100 737 MAX 10 jets, the longest and latest variety of the jet, with options to buy 30 more. Both orders represent a shot in the arm for the aircraft, which has been beset by a nearly two-year grounding after two deadly accidents.</p><p>Delta said Tuesday it would also buy 12 Airbus A220s, bringing its total for the former Bombardier aircraft to 107 aircraft. The U.S. carrier had 56 of the jets operating in its fleet as of the end of June.</p><p>Benjamin Katz contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing Nears 787 Dreamliner Order With Aircraft Lessor</p>",
