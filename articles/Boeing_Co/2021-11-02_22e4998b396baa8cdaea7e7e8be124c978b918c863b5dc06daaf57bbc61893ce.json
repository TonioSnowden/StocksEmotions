  "text": "<p>Sales tell a different story, however, as Amazon's businesses across e-commerce, cloud services and entertainment totaled $110.81 billion in the most recent period.</p><p>Package-delivery giant UPS recorded $23.18 billion in sales and Maersk had $16.61 billion.</p><p>Maersk, which operates hundreds of cargo ships, hasn't historically enjoyed such hefty profits. It posted net losses for the years 2016, 2017 and 2019.</p><p>This is how profits at the same companies looked a year ago, when the Covid-19 pandemic triggered lockdowns, upended business and sparked a jump in e-commerce orders.</p><p>Maersk's latest quarterly profit is still not among the top 10 of S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported quarterly results so far. That list is dominated by technology giants such as Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp.</p><p>Maersk is expanding beyond its ocean-shipping routes. On Tuesday, the company said it was buying airfreight forwarder Senator International in a deal worth $644 million. In conjunction with the deal, Maersk is leasing three Boeing 767 freighters and has ordered two new Boeing 777s for its fleet.</p><p>Dominic Chopping and Costas Paris contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Bowdeya Tweh at Bowdeya.Tweh@wsj.com</p><p>Supply-Chain Pain Is Maersk's Gain as $5.44 Billion Profit Dwarfs Amazon, UPS</p>",
