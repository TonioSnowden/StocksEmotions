  "title": "Don't Risk Selling Passenger Planes to Iran; It would jeopardize intellectual property rights and U.S. security.",
  "text": "<p>In the original Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, negotiated by the Obama administration in 2015, the U.S. and Europe agreed to sell Iran hundreds of modern commercial aircraft. At the time, opponents in Congress, such as future Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said the sales would enable the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to weaponize commercial aircraft in terrorist attacks reminiscent of 9/11. Attorney Mark Dubowitz testified before Congress in July 2016 that without any way to control usage, aircraft may be commandeered at the whim of the IRGC to move troops and supplies for malign activities. In fact, some major Iranian airlines like Mahan were excluded from the 2015 deal because they directly supported IRGC activities.</p><p>The technological gap between Iran and the West has grown wider since 2015 because of Western sanctions and advances. Today's commercial aircraft are made of lightweight and efficient composite materials, complex internal electronics and highly fuel-efficient jet enginesâ€”all considered military-grade a few short years ago. Cutting-edge technological prowess is required to maintain such aircraft. Even China, which is more technologically advanced than Iran, remains dependent on jet-engine technology from a U.S.-France joint venture to keep its domestic commercial airliner, the C919, in the air.</p><p>To provide Iran such technology now would be harmful to U.S. interests. No airline can operate and maintain complex aircraft without gigabytes of data about the planes' numerous subsystems. U.S. corporate intellectual property is under constant external cyberassault by malign actors, including Iran. Although U.S. officials such as Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco have acknowledged that cyberassaults have become more diffuse, sophisticated and dangerous, the U.S. seems determined to plow ahead with this provision of the deal anyway. Giving Iran legal access to a vast body of proprietary U.S. technology would only add to the myriad cyber threats that U.S. corporations already face.</p><p>Access granted under an export license won't suffice. U.S. corporations, however sophisticated, aren't equipped to monitor compliance effectively when Iran would have legal access to U.S. aerospace databases. Even the most well-intentioned Iranian airline would be forced to comply if the IRGC demanded to use the airline's legally licensed access to pilfer technology for its own purposes.</p><p>In 2015, when the U.S. most recently authorized aircraft sales to Iran, officials at the State, Treasury and Commerce departments worked diligently with industry to draft as airtight a licensing and monitoring regime as necessary to export crucial technical data. The effort was reasonable and commensurate to address risks known at the time. In developing the license provisions, I (and others) argued that Iranian airlines could access data only for the aircraft they purchased and couldn't forage in U.S. databases for more sensitive information. The export license as well as contractual provisions between seller and buyer made that explicit. Yet hacking technology has advanced substantially since 2015, and in 2022 the IRGC may be both able and willing to penetrate corporate firewalls in the U.S. and Europe.</p><p>If the Biden administration isn't satisfied that a deal can be struck with airlines under the thumb of the IRGC, then selling state-of-the-art aircraft to Iran at all would be foolish. To quote Sen. Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: \"I want the [Biden] administration to understand that no deal is better than a bad deal.\" Selling aircraft to Iran would make it an unequivocally bad deal.</p><p>The Iranian people aren't America's enemy and deserve to travel on safe aircraft that aren't held together with government-approved black-market parts and operated long past their life expectancies. Unfortunately, a change in that reality can't happen under the current Iranian regime without imperiling U.S. national security.</p><p>Mr. Shaheen is a trade-controls and sanctions attorney in Alexandria, Va. He retired in 2021 as chief counsel of global trade for Boeing.</p><p>Don't Risk Selling Passenger Planes to Iran</p>",
