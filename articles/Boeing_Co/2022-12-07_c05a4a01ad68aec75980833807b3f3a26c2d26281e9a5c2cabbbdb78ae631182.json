  "title": "Lawmakers Agree to Rescind Military's Covid-19 Mandate in Defense Deal; NDAA proposal would increase total national security budget to $857.9 billion",
  "text": "<p>This year's NDAA would approve a 4.6% pay raise for military service members and Defense Department civilians, and increase the housing allowance for service members by 2%. The bill, which typically passes with bipartisan support, would also authorize funding for the State Department and intelligence agencies, and for new aircraft, ships and vehicles for combat, while budgeting for newer technologies such as microelectronics and hypersonic weapons.</p><p>The legislation must now pass the House and then the Senate before heading to Mr. Biden's desk for his signature.</p><p>Republicans had pushed for the bill to end the Defense Department's Covid-19 vaccine rulefrom August 2021, arguing that it would help recruitment. Roughly 3,400 U.S. military members have been discharged for refusing to get the vaccine as of April, according to a letter that 13 Senate Republicans sent to party leaders on the issue last week.</p><p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) hailed the revocation of the vaccine mandate as a victory for the military and common sense. But the policy change doesn't reinstate troops discharged for refusing the vaccine, as Mr. McCarthy and other Republicans had wanted.</p><p>Administration officials recently acknowledged the possibility that the Pentagon's vaccine mandate could be repealed in the defense bill, but said they continued to believe the vaccine saves lives.</p><p>Talks over the NDAA bogged down earlier Tuesday as congressional leaders wrangled over provisions unrelated to the U.S. military. In the end, lawmakers didn't include language that would have overhauled energy permitting, enabled banks to do business with marijuana companies and created a process for publishers of smaller news outlets to negotiate for compensation when technology giants such as Facebook and Google use their content.</p><p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) had criticized Democrats for trying to include nondefense provisions, calling them a \"grab bag of miscellaneous pet priorities.\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) had defended the proposals.</p><p>\"We've been working with Republicans,\" he said. \"It's a priority for me. I'd like to get it done. We'll try to discuss the best way to get it done.\"</p><p>The NDAA is one of two major initiatives that Congress is trying to finish by the end of the year, along with a spending bill that would fund the operations of the U.S. government. Negotiators need to reach a deal on funding the government by Dec. 16 to avoid a partial government shutdown.</p><p>Mr. McConnell had questioned whether Congress had time to finish the bill funding the government for the full year, known as the omnibus bill, saying that lawmakers might have to push any deal into next year, when Republicans take control of the House.</p><p>\"I think it's becoming increasingly likely that we may need to do a short-term CR into early next year,\" said Mr. McConnell, referring to a continuing resolution that keeps funding at current levels.</p><p>Democrats rejected that assertion. \"Several weeks remaining are in the calendar year, which is an eternity in Washington,\" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.), who will be the minority leader in the next Congress.</p><p>Among other closely watched proposals that didn't make it into the NDAA was a provision that would have given Boeing Co. a reprieve from a Dec. 27 deadline to win regulatory approval for two new 737 MAX models. A 2020 aircraft-safety law imposed the deadline, after which new planes must feature modern cockpit-alerting systems. Boeing declined to comment.</p><p>Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), who is chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, criticized the exclusion of his energy permitting proposal. He said the \"American people will pay the steepest price for Washington once again failing to put common-sense policy ahead of toxic tribal politics.\"</p><p>Included in the bill is language authorizing up to $10 billion over five years to finance sales of weaponry and military equipment to Taiwan, and provide training and other security assistance to help the island defend itself against a possible invasion by China.</p><p>Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who is chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the Taiwan measures were important. \"It's a deterrence against China and their malign intent against Taiwan,\" he said. \"And it's an expression of our solidarity with Taiwan.\"</p><p>There is growing concern that China could make a move to reunify with Taiwan forcibly within the next few years. U.S. military officials predicted in 2020 that Beijing could invade Taiwan by 2027, and some analysts believe the war in Ukraine could create an opportunity for China to move faster, as the U.S. and allies are distracted.</p><p>The U.S. has been selling billions of dollars of arms to Taiwan for years as part of a \"porcupine strategy\" that raises the cost for China should it invade. That approach provides Taiwan with smaller missiles and other weaponry as well as jet fighters and other, higher-end military platforms.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What do you think should have priority in the new NDAA defense bill? Join the conversation below.</p><p>At the same time, there is a nearly $19 billion backlog of arms deliveries to the Taiwan government, The Wall Street Journal reported last month, underscoring the difficulties the U.S. has had in providing arms during the war in Ukraine.</p><p>The authorization of up to $2 billion a year over five years would mark the creation of a new program to provide U.S. financing to Taiwan in the form of loan guarantees and grants to purchase weapons and other military equipment. The language in the defense-policy bill doesn't guarantee that the program will be funded at that level, as congressional leadership and lawmakers from the appropriations committees continue to haggle over a year-end government funded bill.</p><p>Tucked into the 4,408-page legislation are significant changes to the military-justice system that would randomize court-martial juries and remove commanders' remaining judicial and prosecutorial powers over certain serious offenses, including sexual assault.</p><p>The NDAA compromise would designate $1 billion for defense officials to buy minerals such as hard-to-get metals and lithium-ion battery ingredients for the country's defense stockpile, which has been depleted in recent decades, leaving the U.S. defense supply chain vulnerable to shortages.</p><p>Other provisions in the bill would designate $800 million for security assistance to the Ukrainian armed forces, authorize funding for research and development of a new nuclear-capable cruise missile that could be launched from ships or submarines, and preserve five of nine littoral combat ships. The high-tech, fast-moving ships with lean crews are designed to pursue pirates, detect mines and ply coastal waters, but the Navy had wanted to retire them early, following controversy over their performance and capabilities.</p><p>â€”Andrew Tangel contributed to this article.</p><p>Lawmakers Agree to Rescind Military's Covid-19 Mandate in Defense Deal</p>",
