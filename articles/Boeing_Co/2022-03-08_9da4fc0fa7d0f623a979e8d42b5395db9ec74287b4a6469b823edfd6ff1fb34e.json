  "title": "The Ukraine Crisis:  Titanium Bet  Ties Boeing  To an Oligarch  ----  By Andrew Tangel",
  "text": "<p>    Boeing Co. has suspended parts of its business in Russia, but it still has to deal with its relationship to a key titanium supplier led by a sanctioned oligarch who once worked in the KGB with President Vladimir Putin. </p><p>   The plane maker years ago made a big bet on the country's titanium, crucial for manufacturing its commercial jets and military aircraft, and Boeing has warned that geopolitical changes could create supply problems in the future. </p><p>   Boeing said it has halted purchasing Russian titanium since the country's invasion of Ukraine. It also has closed its engineering offices in Moscow and Kyiv and stopped sending spare plane parts to Russian airlines. But as other Western companies retreat from Russia, Boeing declined to say what it will do about its joint venture with the titanium supplier led by Mr. Putin's former intelligence colleague, Sergey Chemezov. </p><p>   Boeing has been getting about a third of its titanium from Russia, with the rest coming from the U.S., Japan, China and Kazakhstan, a Boeing spokeswoman said. \"Our inventory and diversity of titanium sources provide sufficient supply for airplane production, and we will continue to take the right steps to ensure long-term continuity,\" she said. </p><p>   The titanium partnership began as an outgrowth of deepening East-West economic ties following the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. Boeing invested heavily in Russia and newly independent Ukraine, opening offices for engineers and customer-support staff in both countries. </p><p>   Like other aerospace companies, Boeing in recent months has been stockpiling titanium while looking for additional suppliers should Russia retaliate for Western sanctions by cutting off its supply, industry officials said. The metal is prized for its strength, light weight and ability to avoid corrosion. </p><p>   Rostec, a Russian defense conglomerate whose affiliate supplies Boeing with titanium and is in a 50-50 partnership with the plane maker, declined to comment. </p><p>   Mr. Chemezov, Rostec's chief executive and the affiliate's chairman, was sanctioned by the U.S. after Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. The U.S. government announced additional sanctions targeting Mr. Chemezov and members of his family on Thursday. The Treasury Department declined to comment. </p><p>   Messrs. Chemezov and Putin are close, and worked alongside each other in the Soviet intelligence service in East Germany, The Wall Street Journal has previously reported. The U.S. Treasury Department has previously said the two lived in the same apartment complex there. </p><p>   Boeing and other American companies are still allowed under new U.S. sanctions to import Russian titanium, according to industry officials and lawyers who specialize in export controls. But the escalating war could result in Western businesses losing access to Russia's titanium exports if the Kremlin retaliates with its own sanctions. </p><p>   Sanctions against Mr. Chemezov will broadly prevent him from signing contracts with Boeing, but otherwise shouldn't hinder the plane maker's ability to buy his company's titanium or work with their joint venture, said Brian O'Toole, a former Treasury official who helped craft U.S. sanctions after Russia's 2014 Crimea invasion. </p><p>   Other Western restrictions, including those on U.S. subsidiaries in Russia, however, will likely add bureaucratic, financial and logistical complications for Boeing, as well as the threat of Russian countersanctions, Mr. O'Toole added. Any company \"with a Russian supply chain has got a lot of problems on their hands -- at least for the medium term,\" he said. </p><p>   Before Russia invaded Ukraine, Boeing CEO David Calhoun flagged Boeing's titanium supply as a possible medium-term risk in a January call with Wall Street analysts. \"As long as the geopolitical situation stays tame, no problem,\" Mr. Calhoun said. \"If it doesn't, we're protected for quite a while, but not forever.\" Industry officials said its stockpile has benefited from slower rates of airplane production in recent years. </p><p>   Finding new suppliers of titanium is only the first step. The strength and quality of any new titanium components must be validated through a process that can take a year or longer -- a risk highlighted in Boeing's latest annual U.S. securities filing, which also flagged potentially higher costs and delivery delays. </p><p>   Manufacturers now stockpiling titanium \"relied on Russia a little too comfortably,\" said Michel Merluzeau, director of aerospace and defense market analysis at AIR, a research company in Seattle. </p><p>    Airbus SE receives about half its titanium from the affiliate of Mr. Chemezov's company, a person familiar with the matter said. An Airbus spokesman said the plane maker is \"protected in the short and medium term.\" </p><p>   An Embraer SA spokesman said the Brazilian regional jet maker, which is also a customer of the affiliate, was analyzing its titanium supply chain but \"has no current concerns\" and maintained a strong inventory. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Kate O'Keeffe and Benjamin Katz contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
