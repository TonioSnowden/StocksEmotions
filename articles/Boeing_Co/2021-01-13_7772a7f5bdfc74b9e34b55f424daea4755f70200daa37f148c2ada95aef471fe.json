  "title": "World News: Covid Grounded Jet Before Crash --- Indonesian plane that plunged into the Java Sea last week sat idle for months last year",
  "text": "<p>The Indonesian carrier's aircraft with 62 people on board went down minutes after taking off from the country's capital, Jakarta. There are believed to be no survivors.</p><p>Divers and search crew, who grappled with sharp debris and low underwater visibility, managed to recover the plane's flight-data recorder on Tuesday, an important early step in uncovering why SJ182 crashed.</p><p>The plane had stopped operating in late March, weeks after Indonesia announced its first Covid-19 case, the transportation ministry said. The aircraft began flying again on Dec. 19, after clearing an inspection by the ministry's Air Transportation Directorate General, the ministry said.</p><p>The plane flew a total of 132 times after it resumed operating, according to aviation data provider Flightradar24.</p><p>\"This is pretty standard for this airline and this part of the world,\" said Ian Petchenik, a Flightradar24 spokesman. \"Because aircraft are the main source of connectivity, there are a lot of short routes with high frequencies.\"</p><p>Its first flight after the long hiatus didn't carry passengers and was noncommercial, the ministry said. The first with passengers was on Dec. 22.</p><p>The aircraft's certificate of airworthiness from the transport ministry is valid until Dec. 17, 2021, the transportation ministry said.</p><p>The ministry said it followed an airworthiness directive issued by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration dated July 24 that required operators of some Boeing flight models, including the Boeing 737-500, to conduct an engine inspection before flying. On Dec. 2, Indonesia's air inspector gave the plane an engine-corrosion check.</p><p>In addition to special engine maintenance, U.S. and European regulators have advised airlines that before bringing aircraft out of storage, engineers and mechanics should check the condition of other systems. They include certain flight-control sensors, hydraulic systems, landing gears and valves or other parts associated with cabin pressurization.</p><p>Sriwijaya Air Chief Executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena said Tuesday that since March, Sriwijaya Air had undergone a security and safety audit under the Basic Aviation Risk Standard program, which is run by the Flight Safety Foundation in Alexandria, Va. The audits look at several aspects, including safety- and quality-system management, manual operations, licensing, and supervision of aircraft and spare parts, he said.</p><p>Such BARS audits are designed to look at operational safety for charter planes, business aircraft, offshore helicopters and on-demand aircraft fleets, especially those operating in remote or hazardous environments. Over the years, Flight Safety Foundation officials haven't indicated the audits are geared to assess safety management of traditional airlines. Carriers typically rely on separate audits conducted by the International Air Transport Association, the industry's leading global trade organization, to identify potential safety shortcomings or problems.</p><p>A spokeswoman for Sriwijaya Air didn't respond to requests to comment on whether the plane's prolonged inactivity might have affected its flightworthiness and what maintenance was undertaken when the plane resumed flights in December. The airline said earlier that the plane was in good condition before the crash.</p><p>\"It's important that the full records be made public, to show where it was serviced, when and by whom,\" said Shukor Yusof, founder of Malaysia-based aviation consulting firm Endau Analytics. \"I'm not questioning the reliability of these documents, but it would be really good if we could see a full list, a full history of this aircraft.\"</p><p>Some experts around the world have raised concerns that the lower frequency of air travel during the pandemic could affect air safety. Chow Kok Wah, a Singapore-based aviation consultant, said planes that have been grounded for longer periods than usual require unique inspection protocols. Investigators might look for explanations in the aircraft's maintenance records, he said.</p>",
