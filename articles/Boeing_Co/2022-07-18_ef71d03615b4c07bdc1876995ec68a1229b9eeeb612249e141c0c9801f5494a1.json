  "title": "Business News: Boeing Nears New Dreamliner Deliveries",
  "text": "<p>\"I don't think there will be extra innings added,\" Mr. Deal said at a news conference ahead of the Farnborough International Airshow, which opens near London on Monday.</p><p>The plane maker initially halted Dreamliner deliveries in late 2020 to address manufacturing issues, which raised more questions by its own engineers and the Federal Aviation Administration. The agency approves airplane designs and has final say on when passengers can fly on commercial jets in the U.S.</p><p>The FAA, which ultimately controls when Boeing can resume delivery of the wide-body jets, said it \"will sign off on each delivery only after Boeing demonstrates the aircraft meets FAA safety standards.\"</p><p>The agency isn't currently expected to approve Dreamliner deliveries until later this month at the earliest, people familiar with the matter have said.</p><p>The 787 has proved popular with airlines for long-haul international flights. Major customers including American Airlines Group Inc. have had to pare their schedules because of the delayed deliveries. Boeing said it had about 115 Dreamliners -- together valued at more than $25 billion -- in inventory at the end of March.</p><p>Mr. Deal predicted Boeing would receive more orders for the Dreamliner once the company resumes deliveries.</p>",
