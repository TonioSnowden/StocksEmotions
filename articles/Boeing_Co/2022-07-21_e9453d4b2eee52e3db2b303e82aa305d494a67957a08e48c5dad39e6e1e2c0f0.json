  "text": "<p>The war in Ukraine will prompt governments to refocus on buying conventional weapons, on top of next-generation high-tech systems, as they reassess global threats, the head of one of the world's biggest defence companies has said.</p> <p>Greg Hayes, chief executive of Raytheon, one of the Pentagon's top five “prime” defence contractors, said he expected there to be a “change in procurement” priorities over the next two years as governments looked to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d413576c-c4d5-4ca6-9050-58f3f8dc3c00\">replenish stockpiles of weapons</a> that had been depleted in the conflict but also as they “rethink what the threat environment is”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Ever since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US has maintained that the Indo-Pacific region remains its top defence and strategic priority, where naval and air systems take precedence and land systems are deprioritised. Defence experts believe a dual approach is now necessary.</p> <p>“We're going to need more of these conventional weapons systems to deter Russian aggression,” said Hayes, adding that defensive systems such as Patriot surface-to-air missiles, anti-missile and anti-aircraft systems would be needed along the frontier from Romania up through Finland. </p> <p>“What this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/war-in-ukraine\">war in Ukraine</a> has shown is that some of the older technology, which had not been the focus, is actually still viable in terms of defending a country,” Hayes said.</p> <p>“The whole national defence strategy of the US for the past 10 years or so focused on [the] Indo-Pacific — how do you defend Taiwan? How do you ensure freedom of navigation in the South China Sea?” he continued. “The other threat was insurgencies and terrorism. It was not Russians.”</p> <p>“Shame on us after Crimea — we probably should have understood that this was a possibility” with Moscow's annexation of the peninsula in 2014 but nobody “really gave it much credence” until Russian troops built up along the Ukrainian border late last year, added Hayes.</p> <p>According to Mark Cancian, a former Pentagon official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think-tank, the US was “absolutely strategically caught off guard because we focused on China and had expected Europe to be a less demanding theatre”.</p> <p>He added that over the years, the US had “squeezed out the capacity for surge production” for munitions and some major weapons systems needed in Ukraine because maintaining those “production capabilities was regarded as wasteful”.</p> <p>In May, the US awarded a contract to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/8463a0a9-b677-47ce-845c-1edce14a8700\">Raytheon</a> for Stinger missiles for the first time in two decades, purchasing 1,300 of them for $624mn.&#xa0;</p> <p>Hayes said that the company would like to redesign the missile's “seeker”, which is kept at very cold temperatures to allow it to sense any heat emitted by its target. A complete redesign of the weapon would take five or six years, so, instead, it would receive upgraded electronics and other technology in its warhead.</p> <p>Overall, it will take time for the US and other western governments to respond to the changing geopolitical landscape, while defence companies must contend with widespread <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/230f39ed-9403-4de1-93c8-56c2162e217d\">supply chain issues</a> that are expected to continue at least for the rest of this year.</p> <p>Lockheed Martin chief executive Jim Taiclet told analysts during an earnings call on Tuesday that the deterioration in the global security environment “happened over literally three or four months. What that requires is the Department of Defense to shift gears. And I can tell you, the clutch isn't engaged yet.”</p> <p>Separately, Hayes, who took over as chief of Raytheon after its merger with United Technologies two years ago, said the deal had already proved a success. </p> <p>The combined group, which includes Raytheon's defence and missile businesses, engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney and Collins Aerospace, had identified “more than $10bn of revenue opportunities” from sharing technologies between the defence and commercial aerospace sides of the business.</p> <p>Hayes played down the likelihood of a merger between P&amp;W and Britain's Rolls-Royce in the near term. The two companies used to have a joint venture that built engines for Airbus and a combination of some sort has long been speculated about. </p> <p>“It certainly could never happen today with the regulatory environment,” said Hayes.</p> <p>However, Pratt and Rolls “will always look for ways to collaborate and partner”. </p> <p>“Whether it is a formal partnership like we used to have with IAE [the joint venture], I'm not sure, but we certainly value the technical capabilities of Rolls in terms of complementing some of the things that Pratt could do”.</p> <p>Nothing was likely to happen, however, until either Airbus or Boeing launched a new aeroplane that would require a new engine. “That is probably five or 10 years away,” added Hayes.</p><p>Source: Sylvia Pfeifer in Farnborough and Steff Chávez in Chicago 2022 'Raytheon chief says Ukraine war will change west's weapon-buying priorities' FT.com 21 July.
