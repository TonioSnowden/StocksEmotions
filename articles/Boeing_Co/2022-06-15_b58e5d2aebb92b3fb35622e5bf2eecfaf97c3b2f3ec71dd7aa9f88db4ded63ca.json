  "title": "Caterpillar Shifts Its Main Office To Texas",
  "text": "<p>The move, expected to affect the roughly 230 corporate employees at Caterpillar's headquarters, is the latest in a series of recent relocations that have drawn major manufacturers closer to corporate and government customers and tech giants from Silicon Valley to Texas.</p><p>Cheaper real estate and bigger potential workforces have led companies including Tesla Inc., Oracle Corp. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. to pack up and move their corporate offices over the last two years. Boeing Co. said in May that it would move its global headquarters to Arlington, Va., from Chicago, bringing its leadership closer to federal officials and an engineering talent pool.</p><p>Defense company Raytheon Technologies Corp. said this month that it would move its global headquarters to the Washington, D.C., area from Waltham, Mass., seeking proximity to the Pentagon, regulators and lawmakers.</p><p>Manufacturers have increasingly turned to the Southwest as a destination for new factories, drawn by available space, appealing tax policies and an expanding technology workforce. Caterpillar hosted an investor day in Dallas last month, saying that the growth of electric vehicles and a shift toward more sustainable energy sources would spur revenue growth.</p><p>Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma and Nevada added more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs from January 2017 to January 2020, representing 30% of U.S. job growth in that sector and at roughly triple the national growth rate, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.</p><p>\"We believe it's in the best strategic interest of the company to make this move,\" said Caterpillar Chief Executive Jim Umpleby.</p><p>The equipment maker has continued to evaluate the locations of its offices and operations for business and talent reasons, a spokeswoman said. Caterpillar, which generated $51 billion in revenue in 2021, will continue to employ about 17,000 people in Illinois, ranging from salaried employees in Peoria and computer scientists in Chicago to factory workers who make some of the company's largest mining trucks and tracked bulldozers.</p><p>Caterpillar's move is a setback for Chicago and Illinois leaders' efforts to bring more companies to the city and surrounding area, which has drawn the headquarters of Conagra Brands Inc., Archer Daniels Midland Co. and other companies in recent years. Illinois, Michigan, California and New York all lost a congressional seat following the 2020 census, while Texas, Florida and North Carolina all gained one or more seats. Like other major U.S. cities, Chicago continues to struggle with violent crime -- largely concentrated in relatively few poor neighborhoods -- that has surged in rural America as well.</p>",
