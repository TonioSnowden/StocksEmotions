  "text": "<p>Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury flagged at the company's quarterly earnings last month that snags in its supply chain would again have an impact in October as suppliers come out of a \"15-month hibernation.\"</p><p>Airbus has struggled with on-time delivery of components and quality lapses that have required parts to be reworked as suppliers battle to rehire staff let go during the pandemic, while grappling with depleted cash levels because of the crisis. The restart in production of Boeing Co.'s 737 MAX after its recertification is also adding pressure to the aerospace supply chain.</p><p>Fewer deliveries in October put pressure on Airbus to pull off a year-end delivery spree. Such rushes were common in the years before the pandemic. In 2019, for example, Airbus delivered 138 aircraft in December alone.</p><p>Airbus also said Friday that it booked 22 new orders in October after adding just one new aircraft to its tally in September. The order and delivery challenges come as Airbus pushes to rapidly return to its pre-pandemic production rates, in particular for its A320neo narrow-body jet, which competes with the MAX, to capitalize on the recovery of the travel market and as its biggest rival continues to play catch-up.</p>",
