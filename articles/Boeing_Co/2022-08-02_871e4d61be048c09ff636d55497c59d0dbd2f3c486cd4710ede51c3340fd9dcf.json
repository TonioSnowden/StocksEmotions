  "text": "<p>Global flight tracking service Flightradar24, which provides real-time information about thousands of aircraft around the world, told MarketWatch that flight with the call sign SPAR19 — which was presumed to be carrying Pelosi — has been drawing record eyeballs since it left the United States over the weekend.</p><p>Trackers glued to the service included the state-owned Chinese publication Global Times. \"According to Flightradar24, a Boeing C-40C with the call sign SPAR19 has departed from Paya Lebar Air Base this morning,\" the Global Times wrote at one point, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>\"As soon as the flight became active [Tuesday], it was the most-tracked flight on our service,\" Ian Petchenik, Flightradar24's director of communications, told MarketWatch. \"And then passing Manila [capital of the Phillippines], it became the most-tracked live flight of all time.\"</p><p>And just before the flight landed in Taipei, Taiwan, Petchenik said more than 700,000 people were watching. \"This is as busy as it gets,\" he added.</p><p>The interest in Pelosi's flight was so great that it strained Flightradar24's servers, leading it to put up a virtual \"waiting room\" for people trying to get into the tracking service.</p><p>Previously, Flightradar24's most-tracked flight was Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's commercial jet flight back to Russia after he recovered from a suspected poisoning attempt on his life.</p><p>Pelosi's trip to Taiwan has infuriated China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province to be annexed by force, if necessary. China has warned of retaliation if Pelosi visits, saying its military will \"never sit idly by.\"</p><p>Opinion: Pelosi's Taiwan trip will end an era of ambiguity</p><p>\"The U.S. and Taiwan have colluded to make provocations first, and China has only been compelled to act out of self-defense,\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters Tuesday in Beijing.</p><p>Pelosi's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi's flight to Taiwan was the most watched plane in the world</p>",
