  "text": "<p>UK hopes of clinching a trade deal with the US — seen as one of the biggest prizes of Brexit — are facing a further setback as negotiators are set to miss a critical deadline for securing swift passage through Congress.</p> <p>Trade negotiators were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c26c550e-df9f-4973-b476-d701e341f676\">racing to put a deal</a> before Congress before the end of the month, but will now lose the chance to be covered by “fast-track” legislation known as the Trade Promotion Authority, raising the prospect of a more difficult passage on Capitol Hill.</p> <p>According to people familiar with the negotiations, the deal has also been held up by the Biden administration's decision to focus talks on resolving the long-running <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/863023ac-3a44-4c45-abea-5f46fecbd1ad\">Airbus-Boeing dispute</a>, which is related to aircraft subsidies. </p> <p>The US trade representative's office made clear this month that a settlement was needed in the 16-year dispute between the US, UK and EU to address challenges posed by Chinese entrants to the aircraft sector. Beijing has made it a priority to break the global duopoly of Airbus and Boeing that has dominated for decades.</p> <p>If a trade deal is eventually agreed, it will either be put before Congress without the fast-track protections — and risk being bogged down in disputes — or UK officials could wait for a new TPA to be negotiated.&#xa0;</p> <p>The TPA is US legislation that both governs the process through which trade deals pass through Congress and sets out the overarching principles of US trade policy.</p> <p>The office of US trade representative <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d13982cc-5aee-4963-8d6c-94d106557979\">Katherine Tai</a> said on Monday that she had discussed her “ongoing review” of the US-UK trade talks with UK trade secretary Liz Truss.</p> <p>UK officials were pessimistic about the deal being able to get through Congress without attracting a raft of amendments from lawmakers representing agricultural states, which could significantly slow passage of the deal.&#xa0;Trade rules regarding agriculture and food standards have been among the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62b1e447-c328-4026-b791-4e8306643f5a\">most contentious parts</a> of the US-UK talks. </p> <p>However, one ally of Truss said not having TPA cover “doesn't blow the whole thing out of the water”.</p> <p>Nasim Fussell, the former top trade counsel for Senate Republicans, said that while it was “not impossible” to pass a trade deal without the TPA in place, it would be “a tall order in this environment”.&#xa0;</p> <p>Truss's team said the minister's discussions with Tai this week were “positive”, including around the idea of a “mini deal” covering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f4844a11-2fef-4150-a64b-986bdf244161\">tariffs on whisky exports</a> — which are part of the wider aircraft subsidies dispute.</p> <p>Truss still believed a free trade deal was possible. “If the political will is there on both sides, it can be done,” a Truss aide said. “The mood music is pretty good on things like whisky tariffs, reforms of the World Trade Organization and China.”</p> <p>Pro-Brexit politicians in the UK have long pointed to a trade deal with the US as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/40d74c90-85e5-11e9-97ea-05ac2431f453\">one of the great upsides</a> of leaving the EU. Leading figures in the Trump administration early last year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/383f174e-baa4-49c5-86c3-d2b5f6453fd4\">promised</a> that a US-UK trade deal was at the “top of the list” of priorities.</p> <p>However, the Biden administration has made it clear that trade deals are not a legislative priority, as it focuses instead on its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8cd8071d-cd4f-4d46-ba8f-820211d0e9a9\">domestic economic agenda</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in January that there was no set timeline for completing the US-UK deal. The administration's “primary priorities” were tackling coronavirus and providing economic relief to Americans, she added.</p><p>Source: Aime Williams in Washington and George Parker in London 2021 'US-UK trade deal talks set to miss crucial Washington deadline' FT.com 25 March.
