Defense attorneys noted Forkner wasn't an engineer and that many others were involved in the flight-control system's design and certification.</p><p>Forkner was the company's chief technical pilot for the 737 Max during the airplane's development. In his role he was responsible for training materials and pilot manuals for the aircraft. He left Boeing in 2018.</p><p>An expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.</p><p>Also popular on WSJ.com:</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg and Meta's leadership take remote work to the extreme.</p><p>Ukrainian president asked Biden not to sanction Abramovich, to facilitate peace talks.</p>",
