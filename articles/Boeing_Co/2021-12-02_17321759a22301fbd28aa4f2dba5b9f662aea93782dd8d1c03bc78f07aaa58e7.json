  "title": "China Sets Boeing 737 MAX Directive for Flight Resumption; Regulator instructs airlines on aircraft fixes, saying the plane could return to the Chinese skies by the end of the year",
  "text": "<p>Boeing has said it hopes to resume deliveries of new MAX jets to China in the first quarter of next year, making final approval crucial to its plans to increase production and generate cash to cut its debt.</p><p>\"After conducting sufficient assessment, CAAC considers the corrective actions are adequate to address this unsafe condition,\" the regulator said.</p><p>While Chinese regulators are bringing the country's current 737 MAX fleet closer to again carrying passengers, Boeing still faces other hurdles in handing over built aircraft awaiting delivery to the country's airlines.</p><p>Despite actions by China's aviation authority, a Chinese official with knowledge of the matter said approval from Beijing's top economic planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission, will also be required for the country's airlines to take Boeing jet deliveries.</p><p>\"It's a step-by-step process,\" the Chinese official said, adding: \"Senior leaders will have to sign off before the deliveries can take place.\"</p><p>China's move comes about a year after U.S. regulators cleared the 737 MAX to resume service. China is one of a small number of countries including Russia that haven't recertified the plane, according to Boeing. That is hampering the U.S. plane maker's efforts to clear a backlog of more than 300 undelivered aircraft, the company has said.</p><p>\"The CAAC's decision is an important milestone toward safely returning the 737 MAX to service in China,\" said a Boeing spokesman.</p><p>The company's shares closed up 7.5%, and lifted shares of suppliers such as Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc.</p><p>The Federal Aviation Administration said in a reply to questions that it supported the CAAC's efforts to issue its airworthiness directive, including sending a technical team to China to observe the validation flights.</p><p>Chinese airlines already have around 100 MAX jets, with hundreds more on order from Boeing and aircraft leasing companies. The Chinese government orders most of its jets centrally and distributes them to airlines, which also rent aircraft. There have been no new deals for Boeing jets since late 2017.</p><p>China remains the second largest aviation market after the U.S., with capacity down around 13% from pre-pandemic levels, according to data tracker OAG. Most of this is domestic flying, and airlines have continued to take jets from Airbus SE.</p><p>Boeing executives have said the company is counting on the resumption of MAX services in China to underpin plans to boost monthly production of the aircraft to 31 next year from around 20 at present.</p><p>Boeing is forecast by analysts to deliver around 250 MAX jets this year, rising to almost 500 in 2022. The company doesn't provide delivery guidance.</p><p>Boeing 737 MAX airplanes were grounded world-wide after hundreds of people died in two accidents: involving Lion Air in 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines in 2019. Accident investigators blamed the accidents in large part on a flight-control system that sent the aircraft into fatal nosedives.</p><p>More Aviation News</p><p>See the latest posts on air travel, selected by WSJ editors</p><p>* FAA Chief Steve Dickson Takes On Fight Over 5G and Aviation Safety</p><p>* The Return of Commercial Supersonic Flights May Face a Sound Barrier</p><p>* Private Flying Takes Off, Boosting Demand for Business Jets</p><p>Lingling Wei and Xiao Xiao contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Natasha Khan at natasha.khan@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com</p><p>China Sets Boeing 737 MAX Directive for Flight Resumption</p>",
