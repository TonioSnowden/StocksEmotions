  "title": "Russia Can't Fly without the West—But May Eventually Propel China; Sanctions will devastate Russian aviation by denying it access to Boeing and Airbus parts. They will also give fresh impetus to efforts with China to develop alternatives to Western technology.",
  "text": "<p>How long can they go on? It is hard to say, since these airlines are now banned from most international routes and can cannibalize parts from older jets. Oliver Wyman consultant David Stewart guesses it could take anywhere from six months to two years for aircraft availability to be substantially impacted, depending on inventory and fleet utilization.</p><p>Of course, it cuts both ways. Russia operates 3% of the global fleet, representing a steady stream of \"aftermarket\" cash for Western manufacturers. Boeing and Airbus have engineering centers there, which have now suspended operations. The U.S. company said Monday it had stopped buying from its Russian partner VSMPO-AVISMA, the supplier of a quarter of the world's titanium—a key input for airframes. Western lessors own 70% of Russia's 981 jets in service or in storage and have no clear way of repossessing them.</p><p>But the hit is deeply asymmetrical. Only 1% of Airbus' and Boeing's order backlogs is affected. Unlike the fast-growing Chinese market, Russia's is dispensable for Western aviation.</p><p>Moscow can refocus on its own aerospace industry, which took the lead in the 1960s \"Space Race\" and competes toe-to-toe with the West in military aircraft. Russia's outsize engineering talent and materials capabilities, though, have never been successfully deployed to deliver the safety, fuel efficiency and mass production required in modern civil aviation. In 2006, after years of wasted investment, the country's main manufacturers, including Ilyushin, Sukhoi and Tupolev, were put under the United Aircraft Corporation umbrella.</p><p>There has been a small revival, in the form of the regional Sukhoi Superjet 100. And starting later this year, the narrow-body Irkut MC-21 should be the country's first real challenger to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737. Yet both use a lot of Western parts and engines: The MC-21 flies geared turbofans built by Connecticut-headquartered Pratt &amp; Whitney. While work to \"russify\" the plane, including a homegrown engine alternative, is already in the works, it would take decades to scale into a business capable of matching demand.</p><p>China, which has invested heavily in a similar plane, the C919, is the obvious partner. For a decade, both countries have collaborated on the CR929, a wide-body jet design. The experience has been bumpy amid power struggles, constant delays and a continuing reliance on Western parts. Now sanctions threaten to permanently derail the project.</p><p>Still, Beijing's determination to build up domestic industries in precisely the areas covered by Western export sanctions on Russia, such as aircraft and complex semiconductors, shouldn't be underestimated, even if it has so far failed. Just like weaponizing the monetary system against Moscow, shutting Russia off from high-tech components may entrench the world's partition into two economic blocs. The coincidence of wants between Russia's technology base and China's captive market may prove hard to resist.</p><p>Russia Can't Fly without the West—But May Eventually Propel China</p>",
