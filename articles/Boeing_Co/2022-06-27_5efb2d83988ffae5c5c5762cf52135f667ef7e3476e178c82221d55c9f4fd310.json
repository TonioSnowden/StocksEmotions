  "text": "<p>When it comes to jet lag, there ain't — I report from the window seat of a bustling café in Montreal, hence this paraphrasing of Leonard Cohen — no cure. Nor is there any shortage of <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/jet-lag/\">common-sense tips</a> on how to diminish its intensity or duration. Nevertheless, as a long-haul pilot, I've discovered several more specialised tactics — and I'd love to hear yours, too, in the comments section below.</p> <p>My first tactic is to ask: do I really need to convert to local time? As a pilot I often don't remain in an unfamiliar time zone long enough to bother, and the stays of many business travellers will be as brief. (Indeed, it's common that I'll meet a business-class passenger in the cabin on our outbound leg, nod to them at the same hotel check-in desk in our far-off destination, and then greet them once more as they settle into their seat for our flight home to London a day or two later).</p> <p>Business travellers, of course, with their meetings and social obligations, aren't always free to ignore local time. Nevertheless, when I worked as a management consultant, after a westbound journey I enjoyed the early risings that allowed me to get my inbox and the gym out of the way long before the sun came up; while going to bed as soon as it got dark felt an atavistically natural indulgence.</p> <p>Leisure travellers, as well, have reasons to embrace jet lag. Westbound journeys allow you to immerse yourself — early-morning strolls in Mexico City come most easily to my mind — in the liminal hours of an awakening metropolis, and moments in the life of a city that many locals may only rarely witness. On a westbound trip to a warm place such as Phoenix or Miami — or to the scenic regions to which they're gateways — you'll be bright-eyed and ready to enjoy the outdoors before the heat builds.</p> <p>Eastbound journeys, meanwhile, have their own advantages: after-dark attractions such as night markets (Hong Kong), safaris (Singapore), and cooling air and delightful street food beneath glittering skylines (so many Asian cities) — all of it yours to experience with levels of nocturnal energy you might last recall having in your early twenties.</p> <p>Nevertheless, on longer trips, I'll try to switch to local time. When I arrive as a pilot in a city I know well, I follow my 10am rule: if I can lower my head on to a pillow by then, I'll sleep for three hours, then wake and have a late breakfast. If I reach my room after 10am, I'll push through until an early night. And if I'm a leisure traveller, excited to be in an entirely new place, I'll go exploring no matter how sleepy I feel.</p> <p>Once you're upright, jet lag is about managing symptoms, which for me include a nearly vampirical aversion to bright light; a gravel-like sensation behind the eyes; the desire to prioritise playlists of old favourites over unfamiliar music; and a complete absence of hunger, on occasion for half a day or longer (which in middle age I regard as a feature, not a bug).</p> <p>The best tools for resetting my internal clock are exercise, cold water and fresh air. Even as a fan of running, the decision to tie on my trainers is far harder when I'm overseas but once I do the benefits of cardiovascular activity are all the more apparent; or, if I'm in a hotel gym, I can usually manage to force myself on to the rowing machine (although only after circling it warily for several minutes first).</p> <p>After this, I adopt my father's habit of starting — at least — my shower on the iciest setting (to which he credited his apparent immunity from every cold or flu). The first few moments are almost comically unpleasant; the invigoration that results, however, is spectacular. Or, if I can, I take a more natural plunge: the moments I've felt the brightest in Cape Town have come after running into (and then quickly back out of) the waves of the bracing Atlantic.</p> <p>When even such bushy-tailedness fades, it's time for a nap. Advice differs on the duration that aligns best with our natural sleep rhythms; I follow our rest experts at work, who recommend no more than 40 minutes. I've also occasionally tried meditation apps such as Headspace, which provide a similar reset without the brief fuzziness that can mar a nap's conclusion. And then there's coffee; not only the caffeine and the taste but the ritual, which signals to my mind and body that — whatever time it may feel — <em>this</em> is morning in <em>this</em> city.</p> <p>One of the greatest challenges for the jet-lagged, of course, comes not early in the day, but in the evening, especially on eastern journeys, when your body may not feel ready for the sleep your mind knows you'll need. Pilots, too, must often sleep when we wouldn't otherwise — in advance of an overnight flight, for example, especially if our on-board rest is allocated late in the journey. Again, it's exercise: if I run five miles, shower, enjoy a big bowl of pasta, and then lie down, I will definitely sleep.</p> <p>I'm also strict regarding “<a href=\"https://thesleepcharity.org.uk/information-support/adults/sleep-hygiene/\">sleep hygiene</a>”. Hotel rooms are rarely as dark as I'd like, so I not only draw the blinds but unplug bedside digital clocks, and I'll even position a pair of socks or a room-service menu in front of the standby lights on the TV or other devices. Such scene-setting, however, is mostly theatre, as the most perfect darkness comes from my eye shade (although be sure to invest in one with sufficient internal structure to seal off any gaps around your nose and below your eyes). I also turn the thermostat down to 19 degrees and always use earplugs — the no-nonsense, cylindrical yellow ones that factory workers use, and which I buy by the boxful.</p> <p>I always leave my smartphone out of reach, but I'll read a book on my Kindle until I nod off. On the rare occasions I don't fall asleep within a few minutes, I'll retrieve my phone and start a podcast — history or science, rather than politics — with the volume on its lowest audible setting. Then I'll close my eyes again and seek comfort in the quiet, distant voices, and in the possibility of learning something new in the time before I sleep.</p> <p><em>Mark Vanhoenacker is a Boeing 787 pilot for British Airways and the author of ‘</em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3OEv7Og\"><em>Imagine a City</em></a><em>'</em> <em>(Chatto &amp; Windus/Knopf).</em></p> <p><em>Follow Mark on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/markv747\"><em>@markv747</em></a><em> or email him at </em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&amp;tf=cm&amp;to=mark.vanhoenacker@ft.com\"><em>mark.vanhoenacker@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53260c68-0fef-4ac8-9847-1f99f513f971\"><em>One British boffin's answer to jet lag</em></a><em> / </em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/53260c68-0fef-4ac8-9847-1f99f513f971\"><em>From David O'Keeffe, Bearna, County Galway, Ireland</em></a></p><p>Source: Mark Vanhoenacker 2022 'A pilot's guide to beating jet lag' FT.com 27 June.
