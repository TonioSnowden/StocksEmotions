  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- U.S. authorities filed a warrant to seize two planes owned by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, saying that as U.S.-manufactured aircraft, they are subject to U.S. sanctions imposed in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. </p><p>   According to a court document filed Monday, a Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner and Gulfstream jet owned by Mr. Abramovich flew into Russia after February, a trip that would have required a U.S. export license. One jet is in Dubai and the other in Moscow, according to the warrant. </p><p>   \"Those vessels are not today taken into U.S. custody, but they are now publicly known as wanted property, as tainted assets subject to forfeiture and under active pursuit,\" a Justice Department official said. A representative for Mr. Abramovich couldn't be reached for comment. </p><p>   Known for his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his efforts to serve as a go-between between the Kremlin and Ukrainian leadership, Mr. Abramovich faces U.K. and European Union restrictions but hasn't been subject to U.S. measures on account of his role in the talks. </p><p></p>",
