Dabrowski and Klingner shed light on the Illinois Democratic Party's attempt to embed double-dealing in the state constitution. Unlike in the private sector, where federal laws prohibit collusion between unions and management and ensure that the two parties are on opposing sides of the bargaining table, public-sector unions take full advantage of a legal right they shouldn't have to bribe \"management\"—elected officials—via campaign contributions.</p><p>This corrupt arrangement, which blossomed in the late 20th century, costs Americans billions of dollars annually. Here's hoping that enough Prairie State voters recognize this proposed amendment for what it really is—a move to cement one-party Democratic rule—and vote it down. If not, it won't be long before the Illinois Democratic Party achieves its goal of being referred to simply as \"the party.\"</p><p>John Faure</p><p>Birmingham, Ala.</p><p>Illinois Unions and Democrats Try to Entrench Power</p>",
