  "text": "<p>Officials and observers on both sides of the Atlantic expect any new deal to be challenged in court again.</p><p>The European Court of Justice's 2020 ruling was the second time that it deemed U.S. safeguards on Europeans' data to be insufficient. The court said the U.S. didn't provide EU citizens effective means to challenge U.S. government surveillance of their data.</p><p>Mr. Biden and Ms. von der Leyen didn't provide details of how the new agreement would work and withstand legal challenges. At issue in the talks has been whether the U.S. could assuage the EU—and its top court—with new administrative appeals mechanisms but without a change to U.S. law, which would require approval by Congress, people briefed on the talks have said in recent months.</p><p>Mr. Biden said the \"framework underscores our shared commitment to privacy, to data protection and to the rule of law\" and would allow EU authorities \"to once again authorize trans-Atlantic data flows that help facilitate $7.1 trillion in economic relations with the EU.\"</p><p>Ms. von der Leyen said the agreement \"will enable predictable and trustworthy data flows between the EU and U.S., safeguarding privacy and civil liberties.\"</p><p>If successful, the data agreement would resolve one of the last big point of contention in U.S.-EU relations of recent years. Over the past year, the two sides have agreed a truce in their long-running fight over subsidies to Airbus SE and Boeing Co., struck a deal to unwind U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and have increasingly aligned their positions regarding China's economic practices.</p><p>\"Just like we did when we resolved the Boeing-Airbus dispute and lifted the steel aluminum tariffs, the United States and the EU are finding creative new approaches to bring our economies and our people closer together on shared values,\" Mr. Biden said, standing alongside Ms. von der Leyen in Brussels.</p><p>The deal, if it stands, would mark a major victory for thousands of companies in an array of sectors that transfer data from the EU to the U.S., many of which have warned in securities filings of potential disruption should they be forced to cut off trans-Atlantic data flows. It is particularly important for big U.S. technology companies which have faced mounting threats by European privacy regulators to order them to cut off their transfer of data to the U.S.—and have called on diplomats to strike a deal.</p><p>In France and Austria, regulators, citing the EU court decision, have recently ordered specific websites to stop using Alphabet Inc.'s Google Analytics service because it sends information about users' internet addresses to the U.S., where the regulators say it could be requested by government agencies.</p><p>Write to Daniel Michaels at daniel.michaels@wsj.com</p><p>U.S., EU Reach Preliminary Deal on Data Privacy</p>",
