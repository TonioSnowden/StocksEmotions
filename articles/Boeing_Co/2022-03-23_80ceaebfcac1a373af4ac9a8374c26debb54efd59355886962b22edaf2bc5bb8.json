  "title": "Trial of Ex-Boeing Pilot in 737 MAX Case Goes to Jury; Defense rested its case after one witness; Mark Forkner faces four counts of wire fraud",
  "text": "<p>On Wednesday, the defense called a single witness—Boeing test pilot Barry St. Germain—and rested its case. Other Federal Aviation Administration officials and a former Boeing engineer were among other defendants slated to possibly testify.</p><p>Prosecutors closed their case by describing what they said was Mr. Forkner's scheme to enrich Boeing and himself by defrauding American Airlines Group Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. of tens of millions of dollars.</p><p>Federal prosecutor Mike O'Neill accused Mr. Forkner of tricking Stacey Klein, his FAA counterpart, into approving lighter training requirements to avoid costing Boeing tens of millions of dollars.</p><p>Mr. O'Neill said Mr. Forkner learned that the flight-control system known as MCAS had been expanded to include low-speed flying conditions—not just high-speed conditions airline pilots wouldn't likely ever encounter—but failed to tell Ms. Klein and then sought to cover up his deception.</p><p>\"It's lies for money, plain and simple,\" Mr. O'Neill said.</p><p>Defense attorneys said Mr. Forkner never learned that MCAS's authority had been expanded to lower speeds, arguing he had been kept in the dark by Boeing engineers and test pilots responsible for designing the automated cockpit feature and building the aircraft.</p><p>In his closing argument, defense attorney Jeff Kearney sought to discredit Ms. Klein and another key government witness, senior Boeing engineer David Loffing. Mr. Loffing was a senior Boeing engineer assigned to the 737 MAX development before later becoming the chief engineer for the company's newest plane, the 777X.</p><p>Mr. Kearney said Mr. Forkner never lied to Ms. Klein, whose job was to approve pilot training for the new plane—and possibly expensive simulator training that Mr. Forkner, Boeing and the airlines wanted to avoid.</p><p>Noting Ms. Klein had testified she wanted accurate information, Mr. Kearney said Mr. Forkner \"gave it to her—when he knew it.\"</p><p>\"Make no mistake: Mark Forkner did not lie to Stacey Klein,\" Mr. Kearney said.</p><p>Defense attorneys repeatedly pointed out that the government produced no record of a phone call in which Mr. Loffing claimed he told Mr. Forkner that MCAS had in fact been expanded.</p><p>Mr. Loffing testified Tuesday that Mr. Forkner called him after a 2016 simulator experience in which prosecutors claim Mr. Forkner learned the system had been expanded and told a colleague in a chat message: \"So I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly).\" Mr. Forkner's attorneys have argued the former Boeing pilot was complaining about a malfunctioning simulator, not the MCAS.</p><p>Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com</p><p>Trial of Ex-Boeing Pilot in 737 MAX Case Goes to Jury</p>",
