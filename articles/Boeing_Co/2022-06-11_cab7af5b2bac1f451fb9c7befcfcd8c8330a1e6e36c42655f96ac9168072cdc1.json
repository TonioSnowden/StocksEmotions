  "text": "<p>Allows GOP Map</p><p>A federal appeals court said Louisiana for now can use a Republican-backed congressional map that civil-rights groups argue unlawfully reduces the voting power of Black residents.</p><p>Louisiana's Republican-controlled state legislature passed the map in March on a nearly party-line vote. The legislature overrode a veto from Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, who said at the time that he objected to the map because it didn't add a second majority-minority district.</p><p>The map was expected to result in Louisiana, whose population is roughly one-third Black, having five Republican U.S. House members and one Democratic member, as it does now.</p><p>A group of voters and civil-rights groups sued in March to challenge the map, alleging it violated the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 by packing large numbers of Black voters into a single congressional district and dividing other Black voters among the five remaining districts.</p><p>-- Alexa Corse</p><p>---</p><p>WHITE HOUSE</p><p>Air Force One's Color</p><p>Scheme to Remain</p><p>The Biden administration has abandoned former President Donald Trump's proposal to alter Air Force One's longstanding color scheme by painting the fleet of presidential aircraft red, white and blue.</p><p>A Biden administration official said Mr. Trump's proposal wasn't being considered because it would require additional engineering, as well as increased time and cost. Officials are considering several other paint schemes but haven't yet made a final decision.</p><p>Pentagon officials had determined that the dark blue in Mr. Trump's preferred color scheme would cause certain electronic components on the new aircraft to overheat, according to the U.S. Air Force.</p><p>The two new U.S. presidential jets are Boeing Co. 747-8 commercial aircraft that will be known as VC-25B military variants.</p><p>While in office, Mr. Trump frequently talked about his desire to redesign the look of the iconic plane, which has been painted the same light blue and white since the Kennedy administration.</p><p>Mr. Trump's spokesman, Taylor Budowich, criticized Mr. Biden's decision, saying, \"It's no surprise he wants to remove the beautiful red, white and blue design for Air Force One.\"</p><p>-- Andrew Tangel</p><p>---</p><p>TEXAS</p><p>Judge Bars Probes in</p><p>Transgender Cases</p><p>A Texas judge on Friday temporarily blocked the state from investigating families of transgender children who have received gender-confirming medical care, a new obstacle to the state labeling such treatments as child abuse.</p><p>The temporary restraining order issued by Judge Jan Soifer halts investigations against three families who sued, and prevents any similar investigations against members of the LGBTQ advocacy group PFLAG Inc. The group has more than 600 members in Texas.</p><p>The ruling comes about a month after the Texas Supreme Court allowed the state to investigate parents of transgender youth for child abuse while also ruling in favor of one family that was among the first contacted by child welfare officials following order by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.</p><p>-- Associated Press</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
