  "title": "EXCHANGE  ---  Business News: Boeing Said to Have Paused  737 Max Production in May  ----  By Andrew Tangel and Doug Cameron",
  "text": "<p>   Supply-chain snags led Boeing Co. to recently pause 737 MAX production for about 10 days, people familiar with the matter said, complicating the plane maker's ability to satisfy airlines' demand for new aircraft. </p><p>   Boeing's problems with delivering new narrow-body jets have frustrated customers such as Ryanair Holdings PLC as carriers seek to capitalize on surging air travel demand, and hindered the plane maker's efforts to generate cash to pay down debt. </p><p>   Boeing is expected to burn through around $3.6 billion in cash during the first half of 2022, according to analysts' estimates, though the company forecasts it can have positive cash flow for the year. That outlook hinges in large part on the number of MAX deliveries and the resumption of 787 Dreamliner deliveries. </p><p>   Boeing's recent 737 production pause occurred in May, people familiar with the matter said. Work inside the factory didn't halt during the slowdown, one of these people said. </p><p>   Chief Executive Officer David Calhoun said supply constraints have kept Boeing from increasing production and delivering more 737s. \"It's a relatively hot market,\" he said at an investor event Friday. \"Right now, demand is significantly better than supply.\" </p><p>   Boeing's 737 factory output has lagged behind its target production rate of 31 a month, with the manufacturer minting 26 of the new jets in March and 21 in April, according to estimates by Ascend by Cirium. The aviation data provider estimates Boeing produced 20 MAX jets last month through May 26. </p><p>   Boeing is running into difficulties reducing its inventory of completed 737 MAX jets, totaling some 320 at the end of the first quarter. Planes that wound up in storage during a nearly two-year grounding of the jet are taking longer than anticipated to prepare for delivery, a person familiar with 737 production said. </p><p>   On Friday, Mr. Calhoun said the modification work on stored 737 MAX jets was becoming easier to replicate. \"We're beginning to get a little more predictable on that front, and that's a big deal,\" he said. </p><p>   Boeing delivered 24 of its 737 MAX jets in May, one-third of them from inventory, according to preliminary Cirium data. </p><p>   Boeing and rival Airbus SE are due to release final May delivery numbers later this month. While analysts expect deliveries of the European plane maker's A320neo family jets to also fall short of its targeted monthly production of around 50, Airbus is still producing more jets than Boeing. </p><p>   Both companies are struggling with supply-chain issues, but Boeing has delivered fewer planes than its European rival as airline traffic recovers from pandemic-driven lows. Boeing delivered 109 MAX jets through April, compared with the 146 A320neo-family aircraft Airbus handed over to customers in the first four months of the year. </p><p>   The delivery delays have led Ryanair to cut flights from its summer schedule. Michael O'Leary, the European discount carrier's CEO, said he could understand challenges manufacturing new aircraft. \"But aircraft that you built and made two years ago,\" Mr. O'Leary said, \"I don't understand why . . . you are taking two or three month delays on that,\" he told analysts in May. Ryanair has received more than 60 of the 200 MAX jets it ordered. </p><p></p>",
