  "title": "Dow gains as bank stocks rise, but Nasdaq under pressure as Treasury yields briefly bust out to 1.5%",
  "text": "<p>What are major indexes doing?</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA traded up 164 points, or 0.5%, at 34,960, and had hit a intraday peak at 35,061.12 .</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index SPX was down 5 points, or 0.1%, to around 4,451.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP retreated 0.5%, or 72 points, to reach 14,974, but had been as low as 14,864.96 earlier Monday.</p><p>The small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT soared 1.7% to 2,287.</p><p>On Friday, the Dow rose 33 points, or 0.1%, to 34798, the S&amp;P 500 increased 7 points, or 0.15%, to 4455, while the Nasdaq dropped 5 points, or 0.03%, to 15048.</p><p>What's driving markets?</p><p>A move in yields was serving as the main catalyst for stocks Monday, with a renewed selloff for the benchmark 10-year Treasury pushing its rate back above 1.5% for the first time since late June, according to FactSet. Yields and prices move in opposite directions.</p><p>Rising yields can increase the discount rate for tech-related stocks and highly valued sectors, while helping to boost shares of financials whose business models benefit from higher longer-end rates. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS shares advanced 2.2%, while the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETFXLF rose 1.2%.</p><p>Meanwhile, an energy crisis sweeping the globe was also in focus on Monday. Power shortages led to forced factory production cuts in China, while in the U.K., a shortage of truck drivers led to hoarding and declining inventories at gas stations.</p><p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs hiked their oil-price forecast to $90 a barrel, citing the impact of what it said was the most bullish hurricane in U.S. history on supply. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF XLE jumped 3.6% as oil prices continued to press higher.</p><p>Energy disruptions, meanwhile, highlight what's been a growing issue for the global economy, namely that supply hasn't recovered as fast as demand in a variety of markets.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had forecast a 0.6% rise.</p><p>Investors continued to cast a wary eye on the impact of China Evergrande's HK:3333 debt troubles on the world's second-largest economy, while elections in Germany, the No. 1 European economy, have so far failed to produce a decisive result in what's expected to be months of coalition talks.</p><p>There are a number of Federal Reserve officials due to speak this week. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, in a speech Monday morning, said he was more worried that the economy wouldn't produce enough inflation rather than run too hot. New York Fed President John Williams and Fed Gov. Lael Brainard were also due to speak Monday.</p><p>“The lack of a clear winner in Germany's election combined with a new batch of speeches from most central bankers may slow the rally down,” said Pierre Veyret, technical analyst at ActivTrades, in a note. “In addition, investors' eyes are cautiously monitoring the situation in China where both the energy and liquidity crises are worsening, increasing worries of a knock-on impact on other economies.”</p><p>In public health news, chief executive of Pfizer Inc.PFE said the company is expecting to submit data from late-stage trials of its COVID-19 vaccine in 5- to 11-year-old children to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration within days, raising hopes that another key patient group will soon be eligible for shots.</p><p>Which companies are in focus?</p><p>Swedish electric car maker Polestar Performance AB said Monday it would go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Gores Guggenheim Inc.GGPI&#xa0;in a deal with an implied enterprise value of about $20 billion.
