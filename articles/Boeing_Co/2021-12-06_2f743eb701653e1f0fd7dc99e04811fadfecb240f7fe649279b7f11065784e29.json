  "text": "<p>\"Everyone is being impacted by supply-chain disruptions, and that has opened a lot of investors' eyes to the technology gap in supply chains,\" said PitchBook senior analyst Asad Hussain.</p><p>Here are the firms that have completed the most financings into supply-chain startups since 2019:</p><p>Alumni Ventures Group</p><p>Tiger Global Management</p><p>8VC</p><p>Gaingels</p><p>SoftBank Investment Advisers</p><p>The venture arms of shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S and industrial real-estate firm Prologis Inc. were also among the top investors in the sector, according to the report.</p><p>And now on to the news...</p><p>Top News</p><p>Digital health. Vinehealth Digital, a U.K.-based startup seeking to help drugmakers gain a better understanding of cancer patients' experience with their medications, has raised $5.5 million as it plans to expand in the U.S., WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports.</p><p>Drugmakers aim to collect a variety of data about how their medications affect patients in clinical trials and in real-world settings outside of clinical research. That information can help them develop better treatments or support patients after a drug is launched. Vinehealth, which says it supplies patient-reported outcome data to drugmakers such as Novartis AG, provides a digital alternative to paper surveys that have been used to collect such information.</p><p>Vinehealth has developed an app patients use when they join a clinical trial or other research study. Through the app, patients input information on issues such as symptoms and side effects, as well as their diet, exercise and sleep. This information is shared with their consent with their doctor and, in aggregated form, with the pharmaceutical company.</p><p>5.5%</p><p>The decline of fund manager Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation exchange-traded fund on Friday, as technology stocks staged a sharp pullback. (WSJ)</p><p>Providence Strategic Growth Is Pitching Its Second European Fund</p><p>Providence Strategic Growth Capital Partners, or PSG, has returned to the fundraising trail with plans to raise €2 billion, equivalent to about $2.26 billion, to back investments in European software and technology-enabled companies, people familiar with the firm say. The new fund, Providence Strategic Growth Europe II LP, is at least the fourth fund that the Boston-based firm has raised or sought to raise this year as investor appetite for private equity has put the industry on track for a record fundraising year, Preeti Singh writes for WSJ Pro.</p><p>Should Investors Ride Tech Founders to the Moon?</p><p>Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey's resignation letter included some parting words of caution: Being \"founder-led,\" he wrote, can be \"severely limiting and a single point of failure\" for a business, WSJ reports. The advice probably fell on deaf ears. As Mr. Dorsey wrote: \"There aren't many founders who choose their company over their own ego.\" And, in another sign that irony is dead, he remains chief executive of payments company Square Inc., soon to be known as Block, which he co-founded in 2009.</p><p>Omicron Variant Puts Companies on Notice This Holiday Season</p><p>Concerns about a new Covid-19 variant are prompting some U.S. businesses to double down on vaccine mandates and to rethink hosting holiday festivities this month, while many others are taking a wait-and-see approach as they look to government agencies for more guidance, WSJ reports. Since the discovery of the Omicron coronavirus variant was disclosed last week, much about it remains unknown. Scientists are racing to determine how it differs from other variants in its spread and response to vaccines, treatments and past infections. The World Health Organization has declared Omicron a \"variant of concern,\" indicating it carries higher risks than other virus strains. Meanwhile, the U.S. has now found multiple cases of the Omicron variant. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now recommending everyone 18 years old and older get a booster shot after completing a first course of Covid-19 vaccination.</p><p>Industry News</p><p>Funds</p><p>Allegion Ventures raised $100 million for its second fund, double the amount secured for its inaugural vehicle back in 2018.
