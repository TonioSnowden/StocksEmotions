  "title": "Business News: Corporate Earnings Watch --- Thursday was a busy day for companies to report second-quarter results",
  "text": "<p>The European plane maker boosted guidance for operating profit to 4 billion euros, equivalent to $4.75 billion, and said it would deliver 600 aircraft to airline customers this year.</p><p>That compares with expectations for earnings of 2 billion euros and deliveries of 566 jets given at its first quarter update in April.</p><p>Airbus also said its board had formally signed off on plans to develop a freighter version of its A350 long-haul aircraft, in a challenge to Boeing Co.'s dominance in the market for wide-body cargo planes.</p><p>The aircraft, which Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said will enter into operation from 2025, will be based on the bigger version of the plane.</p><p>\"We've been quite absent from the wide-body freighter market so far, it was almost an exclusive Boeing market segment,\" Mr. Faury told reporters. \"We're very happy to come with a very competitive product.\"</p><p>-- Benjamin Katz</p><p>---</p><p>NORTHROP GRUMMAN</p><p>Northrop Grumman continued the run of strong results by defense contractors, with forecast-beating quarterly profit and a higher full-year earnings forecast as it booked more deals for classified government programs.</p><p>The company is one of the biggest players in secretive projects such as spy satellites, as well as the Pentagon's new B-21 bomber and a refresh of land-based nuclear missiles.</p><p>Profit rose marginally in the June quarter to $1.04 billion, but a 7% rise in per-share earnings of $6.42 after adjustment for asset sales handily beat the $5.84 consensus among analysts polled by FactSet. Organic sales rose 10% in the quarter from a year earlier.</p><p>Northrop Grumman joined Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics in boosting its full-year profit outlook, with Boeing's defense unit also delivering a forecast-beating quarter.</p><p>Northrop Grumman's space business was the standout in the quarter, with sales up 34% on a mix of classified work and revenue from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Artemis moon exploration program and ferrying cargo to the International Space Station.</p><p>Northrop Grumman CEO Kathy Warden backed Blue Origin's offer to provide NASA with a $2 billion subsidy for the latter's lunar lander, which failed to win a place alongside SpaceX on the initial planned flights.Northrop partnered with prime contractor Blue Origin and Lockheed Martin.</p><p>-- Doug Cameron</p><p>---</p><p>PG&amp;E</p><p>PG&amp;E Corp. said it will likely incur a loss related to the Dixie Fire, a large Northern California wildfire that ignited earlier this month, but said it \"cannot reasonably estimate the amount or range of such possible loss at this time.\"</p><p>The company earlier told regulators that its equipment may have ignited the fire, which has grown to cover more than 220,000 acres in Butte and Plumas counties.</p><p>Earlier, the utility company reported $5.22 billion in operating revenues, which rose 15% from a year earlier.</p><p>Earnings were at $401 million, compared with a loss of $1.97 billion.</p><p>-- Katherine Blunt</p><p>---</p><p>YUM BRANDS</p><p>Yum Brands says its restaurant owners have been increasing prices moderately across its brands to deal with inflation in the U.S.</p><p>\"We are confident that our brands have strong pricing power,\" financial chief Chris Turner told investors. Owners are rolling out price increases over time to try to blunt their impact, Mr. Turner said. The global chain owner said it is feeling the impact of inflation in the U.S. more than in its other markets.</p><p>-- Heather Haddon</p><p>---</p><p>HERSHEY</p><p>Candy giant Hershey said it doesn't see higher costs letting up anytime soon.</p><p>Strong demand in North America during the second quarter boosted Hershey's costs throughout the supply chain, the company said, including overtime at the candy maker's manufacturing plants, as well as for freight, warehousing and packaging.</p><p>Financial chief Steve Voskuil said he expects many cost increases to persist in the second half of the year. Labor costs in particular will stay elevated as higher levels of \"marketplace attrition\" drive more overtime and hiring to meet demand. Hershey says price increases coming into effect will help assuage some of these costs, and it is continually evaluating the inflationary environment.</p><p>\"Pricing will remain a key part of our strategy going forward,\" Mr. Voskuil said.</p><p>Hershey said Thursday that sales rose 16.5% to $1.99 billion, topping analysts' expectations as it saw a recovery in away-from-home consumption and international markets, while at-home consumption continued.</p><p>-- Jesse Newman</p><p>---</p><p>MASTERCARD</p><p>Mastercard logged an increase in second-quarter revenue and profit, pointing to the continued recovery in domestic and cross-border spending.</p><p>The credit-card company's profit increased to $2.07 billion from $1.42 billion.</p><p>Revenue jumped 36% to $4.53 billion.</p><p>Mastercard Chief Executive Michael Miebach said that in addition to the bounceback with domestic travel, \"International travel is still in the early stages of recovery and represents additional upside potential.\"</p><p>-- Allison Prang</p><p>---</p><p>ALTRIA</p><p>Altria Group says it has paused the rollout of its heated-tobacco product IQOS pending the outcome of a patent dispute with rival British American Tobacco.</p><p>In May, an administrative law judge at the U.S. International Trade Commission found that IQOS products infringe two patents owned by BAT. The agency's commissioners now must vote on the matter.</p><p>IQOS is available in four U.S. states. Altria is selling the product in the U.S. through a partnership with Philip Morris International.</p><p>Earnings rose to $2.15 billion from $1.94 billion a year earlier. Revenue grew by 8.9% to $6.94 billion. Both were higher than analysts expected.</p><p>-- Jennifer Maloney</p><p>---</p><p>SHELL</p><p>Royal Dutch Shell said it would boost returns to shareholders after its profit was buoyed by higher oil prices, the latest sign of recovery in the pandemic-hit energy industry.</p><p>Shell on Thursday said it would buy back $2 billion worth of shares by the end of the year and raised its second-quarter dividend to 24 cents a share, up from 17 cents in the previous quarter.</p><p>The moves come as oil companies work to maintain their appeal to investors after being one of the worst-hit industries by the pandemic, with Shell writing off billions of dollars of assets and cutting its dividends. The sector is also facing growing scrutiny over the transition away from oil and gas toward lower-carbon energy.</p><p>\"Providing a compelling investment case for our shareholders is a top priority for us,\" Shell Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said.</p><p>Shell reported a second-quarter profit on a net current-cost-of-supplies basis -- a figure similar to the net income that U.S. oil companies report -- of $2.6 billion, up from a loss of $18.4 billion for the same period a year earlier. The company's net debt stood at $65.7 billion.</p><p>-- Sarah McFarlane</p><p>---</p><p>ANHEUSER-BUSCH INBEV</p><p>Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev reported a nearly 28% rise in second-quarter sales to $13.54 billion -- back to pre-pandemic levels -- as drinkers returned to bars across the Americas and Europe. However, the world's largest beer company also warned it was contending with rising prices of ingredients and higher freight costs.</p><p>Concerns about the impact of higher costs on profitability sent shares down as much as 8% Thursday morning. They finished down 5.6%.</p><p>-- Nick Kostov</p>",
