  "text": "<p>One thing to start: <strong>JPMorgan Chase</strong> will open the <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/a2031a6f-827e-4e18-b81b-e607eb073988?\">first overseas retail bank</a> in its 222-year history next week with the launch of a digital-only lender that aims to disrupt the UK banking market.</p> <h2>Lagardère nears defeat in the fight for his family empire</h2> <p>If anyone needs a reminder of the French billionaire industrialist<strong> Vincent Bolloré</strong>'s mastery in corporate battles, look to the latest developments at <strong>Lagardère</strong>.&#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Vivendi</strong>, which is controlled by<strong> Bolloré</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b90697dd-f587-48fe-9284-5393d820fa02\">announced</a> this week that it would buy out the activist investor <strong>Amber Capital</strong>'s 17.9 per cent stake in Lagardère as agreed under their surprise alliance.&#xa0;</p> <p>That paves the way for Vivendi to make a takeover offer for Lagardère (if regulators approve) because the deal with Amber will take its holding to 45 per cent — past the threshold requiring a mandatory offer for the rest of the company.</p> <p>The moves will effectively end a five-year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fdde7f3-1cdb-4ef6-ac3b-9a2eb1b7f314\">battle for control</a> of the French media and travel retail group that has captivated the Paris business elite.&#xa0;</p> <p>Ignore the polite press releases — this is Bolloré delivering the <em>coup de grâce</em> to <strong>Arnaud Lagardère</strong>. Despite his <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ded0934f-efea-4e16-9e28-a60279885fd7\">desperate manoeuvring</a>, the family heir will see the company fall under Vivendi ownership.&#xa0;</p> <p>We imagine his father, the legendary businessman <strong>Jean-Luc Lagardère</strong>, who built the defence-to-media conglomerate before his son dismantled most of it, is turning in his grave.</p> <p>For Amber founder <strong>Joseph Oughourlian</strong>, the exit will be an honourable end to a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83015a6e-0ae9-11ea-b2d6-9bf4d1957a67\">bloody saga</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>With Vivendi offering €24.10 a share, Amber has made money on its investment in Lagardère. Its cost price for the shares ranges from €15-€20 given that it added to its position last spring, when the pandemic had beaten down the company's stock price.&#xa0;</p> <p>Bolloré has also arguably outplayed <strong>LVMH </strong>chief <strong>Bernard Arnault</strong>, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/98805d0c-cdf7-4926-b178-595a9984714c\">came to the rescue</a> of Arnaud Lagardère in 2020 and still owns a roughly 10 per cent stake in the group.&#xa0;</p> <p>The key moment came in August last year when Bolloré <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b7225fd-059d-4eb4-923a-310636d46adb\">made an alliance</a> with his one-time opponent Amber, which gave him right of first refusal on the activist's stake when it wanted to exit. People familiar with the matter told the FT's Leila Abboud that Arnault was first offered a similar deal by Amber last year, but chose not to act.</p> <p>Perhaps the luxury magnate simply didn't want the Lagardère assets enough to commit more capital, or he thought his position was secure without Amber. After all, the official story is that Arnault bought into the French group to help the younger Lagardère out of loyalty to Jean-Luc's memory.&#xa0;</p> <p>But he was also said to be interested in its media assets — the influential <strong>Journal du Dimanche</strong>, the celebrity magazine <strong>Paris Match</strong> and <strong>Europe 1</strong> radio. Those titles are on their way to Bolloré's Vivendi now.&#xa0;</p> <p>Weaker French media players ought to be looking over their shoulders, the FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c45ff4f-bbdf-43b0-b93a-865d61dcd484?desktop=true&amp;segmentId=d8d3e364-5197-20eb-17cf-2437841d178a#myft:notification:instant-email:content\">Lex column warns</a>, as Bolloré's influence reaches new heights.</p> <h2>The music industry's most powerful CEO approaches his biggest act yet</h2> <p><strong>Universal Music</strong>'s<strong> Lucian Grainge</strong> is the<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bb1dd99a-8652-11e2-ad73-00144feabdc0\"> most powerful executive</a> the music industry has ever seen. <strong>Elton John</strong> told the FT he would “walk through fire for him”, while <strong>Taylor Swift </strong>said: “I know he trusts me, and therefore I return that trust.”&#xa0;</p> <p>And he's got the ear of one of the most powerful men in France, the aforementioned Bolloré, whose group Vivendi owns Universal Music.</p> <p>Most DD readers are probably familiar with the recent drama surrounding Universal, the music label behind artists such as <strong>Lady Gaga</strong> and <strong>ABBA</strong>.</p> <p>The hedge fund billionaire <strong>Bill Ackman</strong> wanted to acquire a $4bn stake in the company, before its listing, through his special purpose acquisition company but regulators stepped in and he was forced to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e819d8c9-2f0f-43f5-a652-1dd216da31f1\">drop the deal</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>As a show of good faith, Ackman agreed to buy the stake through his hedge fund <strong>Pershing Square</strong>. But it's another transaction that put Universal's chief executive on the map.&#xa0;</p> <p>The 61-year-old from North London has gleaned much of his power through <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ad53b90-0388-11e2-bad2-00144feabdc0\">the £1.2bn purchase</a> of the ailing label <strong>EMI</strong> in 2011, an era-defining deal at a fire sale price.</p> <p>At the time Universal was the largest player in a dying industry that needed to consolidate at all costs. EMI was the obvious target, after enduring a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25526d60-e6b2-11de-98b1-00144feab49a\">disastrous buyout</a> by <strong>Terra Firma</strong>, <strong>Guy Hands</strong>' private equity firm.</p> <p>Almost everyone in the industry assumed regulators would intervene: “When he signed the letter to buy EMI I remember him saying, ‘I don't know if this is going to work, but fuck it, I'm going to try,'” a former US executive recalls.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>The famous<strong> Beatles</strong> producer <strong>Sir George Martin</strong> dubbed the deal “the worst thing that music has ever faced”. But by selling off just enough of EMI's parts to placate regulators, Universal emerged with a market share of roughly 40 per cent, something no music company had enjoyed before.</p> <p>It's just one of the gripping out-takes from this <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ae259b02-67a1-4eec-848c-7dc739efa910\">must-read profile </a>of Grainge by our colleagues Anna Nicolaou and Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson.</p> <p>But Grainge's story isn't over yet, as he looks to cement his legacy in what could be the ultimate test for the embattled record label business.&#xa0;</p> <p>Several months ago Vivendi <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/20ae2427-0944-487c-aac0-99286f6c438f\">won the support</a> of its shareholders to spin-off Universal, its largest business on Amsterdam's Euronext exchange in a listing bankers speculate could fetch Universal a valuation of more than $50bn (just eight years ago, <strong>SoftBank</strong> tried to buy the company for $8.5bn).&#xa0;</p> <p>Investors have piled in. <strong>Tencent</strong> snapped up 20 per cent of the company at a €30bn valuation in 2019.</p> <p>Ackman, who now owns a 10 per cent stake in the business, told investors: “I can't think of an asset that I have more confidence in it being consumed over time, other than food and water.”</p> <p>Tuesday's listing will determine whether investors agree.</p> <h2>The Murdoch empire crowns a dealmaker-in-chief</h2> <p>In HBO's hit drama <em>Succession</em>, the duelling sons of an ageing billionaire evoke striking similarities to a real-life media dynasty.</p> <p>But several people who know <strong>Lachlan</strong> and <strong>James Murdoch</strong>, heirs to <strong>Rupert Murdoch</strong>'s sprawling media empire, were quick to separate fiction from reality.</p> <p>“The truth is that they are trying to focus on their own thing,” a person who knows both brothers told DD's James Fontanella-Khan.</p> <p>It's hard to compare the two, said another, since Lachlan has gone on to wield power at his father's cash-generative empire, while James took part of the proceeds from the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aef7357e-e1b2-11e7-8f9f-de1c2175f5ce\">$71bn sale</a> of <strong>21st Century Fox </strong>to <strong>Disney </strong>in 2019 to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/285512c3-52c3-4f21-bb8b-ca89c9e241da\">forge his own path</a>.</p> <p>Since the Disney sale completed in March 2019, Lachlan has emerged as a serial dealmaker, overseeing more than 20 acquisitions totalling almost $7bn, including forays into <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc9ae592-7272-11e9-bf5c-6eeb837566c5\">sports gambling</a>, blockchain, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b2775ccf-3a94-49ee-a5b0-9b7bb9dc2181\">streaming</a>, and publishing. Most recently, he scooped up the celebrity gossip site <strong>TMZ</strong> for less than $50m, according to a person briefed on the deal.</p> <p>Meanwhile, James has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9eab68e1-7afb-4282-95fa-3149bd091efa\">distanced himself</a> from the conservative politics of the news brands controlled by his family, using his $2bn windfall from the Disney sale to spend roughly $700m on deals that include investments in <strong>Vice Media</strong> and start-ups aimed at combating fake news.</p> <p>It's not hard to see which Murdoch brother more closely aligns with their father's vision. But as 90-year-old Rupert enters his final years, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d9719c27-5e95-49c3-a534-2796196c6af7\">questions still linger</a> over the future of the media dynasty.</p> <p>Power over the family trust — which holds the shares in <strong>News Corp</strong> and <strong>Fox</strong> — will be equally dispersed between Rupert's four eldest children once the media mogul cedes control.&#xa0;</p> <p>So while they may not be fighting over the same deals, Lachlan and James will probably have to face each other at the negotiation table when the time comes.</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Boeing </strong>has named<strong> Ziad Ojakli</strong>, a former legislative affairs official to US president George W Bush, as its new head of government affairs.
