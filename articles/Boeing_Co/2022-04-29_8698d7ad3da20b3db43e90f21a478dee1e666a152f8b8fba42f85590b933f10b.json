  "text": "<p>Dear reader, </p> <p>Elon Musk may have won board approval for his $44bn <strong>Twitter</strong> takeover this week but the drama lives on. The deal is not set to close for three to six months. Seeing as Musk went from passive investor to would-be board member to buyer in less than a month, we could be in for a long ride. </p> <p>Lex struggles to see the merits of this deal. Musk is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51489a75-a2a8-464f-9ad2-a32a868713bd\">putting up $21bn</a> of equity commitments and $12.5bn of loans against his own Tesla stock for a slow growth social media company that he will load up with debt. He must find ways to power up the finances. But Twitter has long had problems making a profit. Musk seems to think subscriptions will do the trick. But Twitter has already tried that and has yet to make any sums worth reporting. </p> <p>It is hard to shake the feeling that some aspects of the deal are not entirely serious either. Musk's offer was $54.20 per share. The number 420 is a reference to cannabis culture, the same one he used when making his “funding secured” claim about taking <strong>Tesla</strong> private in 2018.</p> <p>Still, the money he is putting on the line for Twitter is very serious indeed. That makes it an unusual leveraged buyout. Lex notes that in an era of low rates and high asset prices <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b1685865-ed62-40a7-90b0-a5d0d2edb02e\">innovations</a> in the private capital industry tend to multiply. It will take a downturn to distinguish the good innovations from bad. </p> <p>Elsewhere in tech, first-quarter earnings reveal digital advertising hitting the doldrums. Blame the war in Ukraine or rising interest rates. <strong>Alphabet</strong> and <strong>Meta</strong> pointed to both. Of the two companies, we think Alphabet is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d61bc4bb-2748-4e4d-939e-b93ac3b15980\">notably undervalued</a>. The core business remains a cash machine — generating $69bn in free cash flow over the past 12 months. </p> <h2>Vote bloat</h2> <p>Both Alphabet and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/22f75c34-71af-4ece-9951-7b863a17ccf5\">Meta</a> are also known for the control that founders wield thanks to voting rights in shares. In the UK, most companies merged their voting and non-voting shares decades ago. Asset manager <strong>Schroders</strong> is a late addition. Lex thinks the move <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3b995a8-aac2-471c-8d06-1eb1725111d1\">shows confidence</a> in its ability to retain influence. But one Lex reader had a different idea. Perhaps, they wrote, Schroders was “cleaning house” before it sold itself to a US asset manager.</p> <p>It is a thought-provoking suggestion. In fact, comments from Lex readers have been excellent all week. Our call for ideas in last week's newsletter seemed to light a fire below the line. We read all of them so keep them coming. You can always email the team at <a href=\"mailto:lexfeedback@ft.com\">lexfeedback@ft.com</a> if you have any particular thoughts about the column too. </p> <h2>Quarter pounder</h2> <p>Amid the crush of first-quarter earnings published this week, Lex has struggled to find many bright spots. </p> <p>Emerging markets-focused bank <strong>Standard Chartered</strong> was one. The bank has worked hard to build up excess capital reserves and cut costs. Yet, Lex thinks more proof of management's promises is required <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07f0f8f0-ac36-425c-aebe-d2ff9161e0e6\">to re-rate shares</a>. Even after a price rise, Standard Chartered trades at half its book value, well below peers. </p> <p><strong>Boeing</strong>, on the other hand, goes <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4e4c2787-4147-41dc-b98d-cc7191670fee\">from bad to worse</a>. There may be a rebound in air travel but cost inflation and supply chain problems made for a heavy loss in the first quarter. It has pushed back the debut of its newest passenger jet to 2025, too. &#xa0;</p> <p><strong>Unilever</strong> also struggles to juggle rising costs. Indonesia's ban on palm oil exports is a problem for a company that adds it to everything from soap to ice cream. The ban might not last but if it does then Unilever will have a hard time <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b3f39e5-3e09-4ca6-90d5-f5f13f3b3d07\">pushing more price rises</a> on to consumers.</p> <h2>Test results&#xa0;&#xa0;</h2> <p>How long before newsletter round-ups such as this one stop mentioning the pandemic? In the UK, free mass testing for Covid-19 ended at the start of April. Here in San Francisco, masks and tests are both increasingly rare. Only China appears to be the exception, with tests and lockdowns in place to try to stop the latest outbreak. </p> <p>For Swiss pharma giant <strong>Roche</strong>, the 58 per cent jump in test sales reported in the first quarter seems unlikely to be repeated. Both Roche and the wider world have been wrong in predicting the end of the pandemic before. But the test market <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5c8d65e2-4e6f-410d-8a4b-51421f03c3eb\">seems to have peaked</a>. Let's hope vaccine immunity continues to do its job. </p> <h2>Energy&#xa0;</h2> <p>Hopes that Russia's invasion of Ukraine might soon end were squashed this week when the UK's foreign secretary warned that the war could last for 10 years. </p> <p>Russia's decision to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b5112167-fdd4-49fa-acd1-bf9bba95b68d\">suspend gas exports</a> from state-owned <strong>Gazprom</strong> to Poland and Bulgaria shows Moscow is in no hurry to de-escalate hostilities. </p> <p>Three-quarters of Russia's piped gas exports go to Europe. If that disappears and companies are forced to adapt to energy shortages then jobs will be lost. Of course, Russia will suffer economically too. </p> <p>The move follows a demand that customers pay in roubles. A workaround is possible in which European buyers pay euros to Russian bank Gazprombank, which passes the payment on in roubles. But Russia's move to weaponise gas supplies is just getting started. Late this week, some European industrial customers announced their own compromises.</p> <p>Here's hoping our readers' weekends provide some stress-free relaxation. </p> <p><strong>Elaine Moore</strong><br><em>Deputy Head of Lex</em></p><p>Source: Elaine Moore 2022 'The Lex Newsletter: roubles, LBOs and the end of the pandemic' FT.com 29 April.
