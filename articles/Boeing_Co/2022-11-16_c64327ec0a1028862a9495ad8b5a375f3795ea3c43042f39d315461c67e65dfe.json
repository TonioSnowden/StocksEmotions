  "text": "<p>Third time lucky. A Nasa rocket <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e46d76c-1dce-460e-87c7-b211e92a89f2\">blasted off</a> on a mission to orbit the Moon on Wednesday morning after a couple of launch cancellations. It is part of a longer-term plan to put humans on Mars and reignites a space race with China. The biggest benefits could go to private US space companies, including Elon Musk's SpaceX.</p> <p>Nasa's $93bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4ef1a4c0-ce0d-4f9c-811a-1d28e0049c69\">Artemis programme</a> uses Boeing as its main rocket contractor for the first mission. Rivals able to cut costs could replace it. According to Nasa inspector-general Paul Martin, each Artemis launch will cost about $4.1bn — a figure he calls “unsustainable”. This is eight times more than Nasa estimated a decade ago.</p> <p>Privately held SpaceX has a head start. SpaceX has ferried US astronauts to the International Space Station and has a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/25e2292b-a910-41c8-9c55-09096895f673\">$2.9bn contract</a> to develop a rocket that can land crews on the Moon. Its reusable Starship rocket, which should lower launch costs, is in development.</p> <p>The Artemis programme sets a series of increasingly ambitious goals. It aims to orbit the Moon, then send a crewed flight, then undertake a lunar landing. Eventually, the plan is to create a base from which to send human explorers further into space.</p> <p>SpaceX can pencil in Nasa as a client for cost-intensive rocket development. Eventually, it hopes to run its own missions to Mars. Never mind that the planet has about a third of Earth's gravity and an atmosphere that is 95 per cent carbon dioxide.</p> <p>Can SpaceX afford the trip? Musk's fundraising skills are impressive. SpaceX has raised close to $10bn to date. Its last reported valuation was $125bn.</p> <p>Neatly timed press reports on Wednesday said the business could sell a package of mostly secondary shares. These could increase the notional value of the business to some $150bn.</p> <p>The company is generating revenue independently of Nasa via Starlink. The satellite broadband company recently partnered with T-Mobile to provide wireless phone coverage in remote areas of the US.</p> <p>For now, Starlink revenue is just a fraction of the $30bn that Musk is reported to have predicted by 2025. It has more than 400,000 subscribers. Users pay about $110 per month plus one-time terminal costs, meaning it would need more than 15mn subscribers to meet its goal.</p> <p>One day, Starlink may dominate satellite communications while SpaceX dominates rocket launches. But today's Artemis launch demonstrates that it will all take a lot longer than the initial schedule suggests.</p> <p>*<em>This article has been modified to say that that Starlink costs $110 per month plus terminal costs, thereby reducing the number of required subscribers.</em></p><p>Source:  2022 'SpaceX/Musk: Nasa Artemis launch accelerates hunt for star bucks' FT.com 16 November.
