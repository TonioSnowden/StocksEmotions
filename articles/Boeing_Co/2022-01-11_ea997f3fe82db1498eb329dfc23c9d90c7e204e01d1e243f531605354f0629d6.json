US and Russia extend Ukraine talks </strong>After almost eight hours of talks in Geneva between Wendy Sherman, US deputy secretary of state, and Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, Russia agreed <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8c107a70-7cc1-4959-96ce-33ab67a8d9b8\">to extend negotiations</a> to try to resolve the security crisis in Ukraine. </p> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Related news</strong> Russian troops <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d550169b-d50d-4188-86d7-91227810a43d\">will withdraw from Kazakhstan</a>, the country's president said, following a week of violent protests in which citizens demanded social and political change in the central Asian republic.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Companies raise $100bn on global debt market </strong>Corporate bond issuance <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/d72dbda9-0164-4e89-8898-b162538ce605\">reached more than a $100bn</a> in the first week of 2022, with US deals reaching a record pace as finance chiefs sought to lock in low borrowing costs before benchmark interest rates climb. </p> <p><strong>3. Cerberus cuts bet on German banks</strong> The US private equity group is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/995db61d-bbbd-4005-bbb8-0361bdf2762f\">cutting its stakes</a> in Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank as the group scales back an ill-fated bet on Germany's two biggest lenders. It disclosed the holdings in 2017, gambling on a swift recovery of Germany's ailing banking sector as well as a potential merger of the Frankfurt-based rivals.</p> <p><strong>4. Airbus retains crown as biggest jet maker </strong>Airbus has retained its title over rival Boeing as the world's biggest aeroplane maker for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fdbcd101-096c-4d51-aa61-24c082786727\">the third year in a row</a>.

But Beijing has signalled a more cautious approach following a 20-year lending spree. <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/content/64b4bcd5-032e-4be5-aa3b-e902f5b1345e\">What does that mean for the continent</a>?</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/8351435.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><strong>Will the UK and EU agree a deal on N Ireland? </strong>Talks will resume this week on how to resolve the long-running dispute over trading arrangements.

But listening to the concerns of people at the top can inform the debate over how to improve jobs at the bottom, she says.</p> <p><strong>How to ask for a pay rise — and get one!</strong> Claer Barrett, the FT's moneymaking expert, pulls apart that big, scary box labelled ‘Asking for a pay rise' in this week's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94d310ae-8139-447b-8b7b-3ae0a5b0826c\">episode of the Money Clinic</a>. This is a repeat of an earlier episode. </p> <p><strong>A hunting boom in the Midwest prompts soul-searching</strong> The pandemic has sent city slickers back to the land, writes Patti Waldmeir. “I've never seen so many people in the woods,” Jeramie Hotz, a Wisconsin deer hunter-cum-advertising manager, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ef40e4a0-16dd-4ece-acbd-16fcdd47726f\">tells Patti</a>.</p> <h1>Your feedback</h1> <p>Last week, we asked whether nations should pursue a “zero-Covid” policy. Here's what readers had to say: </p> <blockquote>  <p>“Pursuing a zero-Covid policy is essentially a futile and fragile strategy. Indeed, a country has to open up and when it does there will be Covid transmission so ultimately it is a flawed approach that renders the extreme measures that have gone before as meaningless. We sometimes laud countries for their supposed successful suppression of the virus but at what cost to their society? There needs to be a more measured balance adopted.</p>  <p>It also seems to me that those countries pursuing zero Covid are shamelessly letting other countries suffer the pain as they develop the medical and societal approaches to overcome Covid whilst they themselves will seek to reap the benefits of those gains. A zero-Covid approach only works provided other countries are not sealed and do not adopt the same approach (we need only witness the supply chain challenges to understand this). The ultimate free ride perhaps?” —<em> AM, Hong Kong&#xa0;</em></p> </blockquote> <blockquote>  <p>“Sadly, even the fact that we can discuss zero Covid means that it is a policy, and thus&#xa0;political. Certainly public health concerns are wrapped up therein, but the main driver of zero Covid for . . . leaders is to underscore the success of their earlier lockdown and continued provision of substandard vaccines. It is difficult to fault their lockdown strategy, but Covid has proven that more than brute force is necessary to halt the joint health and economic damage of the pandemic. Truly impressive leadership should accept that policy direction must change with evolving realities, even if these realities admit scientific mistakes” — <em>Spencer Dodington, Islington, London</em></p> </blockquote><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Jennifer Creery and Emily Goldberg  2022 'FirstFT: Fed's second-in-command resigns over trading scandal' FT.com 11 January.
