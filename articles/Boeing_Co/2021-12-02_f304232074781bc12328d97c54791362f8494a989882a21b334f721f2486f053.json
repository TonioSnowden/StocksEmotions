This selling will grow much worse; this will become about how much pain the Fed can endure,” said Michael Kramer, chief executive of Mott Capital Management.</p><p>What's clear is that once tranquil markets are now increasingly volatile. Analysts at Bespoke Investment Group found 17 instances since 1928 in which there were three drops of at least 1%, and one gain of at least 1%, in the four days preceding a close below the 50-day average. The median gain in a year's time was 16%, though there were drops of 40% in 2007 and 23% in 1934.</p><p>In economic reports, data released on Thursday showed that initial jobless claims climbed 28,000 to 222,000 during Thanksgiving week.</p><p>On deck later Thursday were appearances by Fed Gov.
