  "text": "<p>In premarket Friday trading, shares in all three of the largest U.S. international airlines were down more than 7%. Shares of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, the owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, fell more than 13% in midday European trading, with similar-sized falls in shares of Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Air France-KLM Group.</p><p>The selling spread to airline makers and their suppliers. Boeing Co. shares were down about 6% in premarket trading, while shares of rival Airbus SE shed more than 10%. Shares in Safran SA, a big Airbus supplier, were down more than 9%.</p><p>Experts from the World Health Organization were due to meet Friday to decide whether to declare the new strain—currently known as B.1.1.529—a \"variant of concern.\" The WHO uses this label for virus strains that have been proven to be more contagious, lead to more serious illness or decrease the effectiveness of public-health measures, tests, treatments or vaccines. Other variants of concern include the Delta variant that is now dominant world-wide and the Alpha variant that drove a deadly wave of infections across Europe and the U.S. last winter and spring.</p><p>The European Union said it would propose an \"emergency brake\" on travel between South Africa, a handful of neighboring countries and the 27-member bloc. On Friday, Singapore's health ministry said it would restrict arrivals and transit for nonresidents who have traveled within 14 days to Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, starting Sunday.</p><p>The U.K. on Thursday placed six southern African states on its so-called red list, a group of countries from which travelers have to quarantine in government-approved hotels.It went a step further Friday and halted all commercial and private passenger flights to and from those countries for two days, from midday Friday.</p><p>Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd., which operates daily services between London Heathrow and Johannesburg, said it would review its schedule of flights to South Africa over the next week to adapt to the changes. The carrier was meant to restart a direct route to Cape Town on Dec. 17. British Airways, which had been ramping up its routes to both cities, said it was working through plans to assist customers currently in the region.</p><p>The new rules mark another setback for long-haul carriers, which have been boosting capacity on international flights in recent weeks. Earlier this month, the U.S. reopened its borders to noncitizens from dozens of countries.</p><p>A spokesman for Lufthansa, which flies between Germany and South Africa 17 times a week, said it was continuing its flights to assist German travelers to return home and to maintain cargo transport. The airline hasn't made any changes to its schedule \"at the moment,\" the spokesman said, adding that it was too early to determine the impact of restrictions on travel demand.</p><p>In Hong Kong, which has one of the strictest on-arrival quarantine requirements in the world, genome-sequencing analysis confirmed two cases of the new variant among people already in hotel quarantine, the city's health department said Thursday. The city's health officials further isolated 12 people who were in hotel rooms near the two cases. No related cases have been detected so far, they said.</p><p>Japan on Friday also tightened restrictions on travel from South Africa and neighboring countries. Effective from Saturday, all travelers arriving in Japan from the region must spend 10 days in a government-mandated hotel or other lodging facility and undergo testing every three or four days, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said. Until now, those permitted to enter Japan from those nations have been allowed to spend their quarantine period at home.</p><p>Peter Landers in Tokyo and Doug Cameron in Chicago contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Benjamin Katz at ben.katz@wsj.com and Natasha Khan at natasha.khan@wsj.com</p><p>New Covid-19 Travel Restrictions Rattle Airline Industry, Hit Shares</p>",
