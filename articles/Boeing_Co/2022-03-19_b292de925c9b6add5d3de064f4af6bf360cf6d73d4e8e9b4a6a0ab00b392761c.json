  "text": "<p>   The bulk of the business was a Russian dairy-and-juice company PepsiCo had bought in 2011 for about $5 billion. The Russian business operated in rubles, and used locally sourced milk and potatoes, though it imported soft-drink concentrates from Ireland. </p><p>   The company's top officials discussed the geopolitical crisis nearly every day. They were reluctant to shut down the Russian operations, according to people familiar with the matter. The leaders wanted to do right by their employees and consumers, and they were under pressure to join other Western companies making moves to penalize Russia. They also had a responsibility to shareholders. </p><p>   On the afternoon of March 8, McDonald's said it was closing its restaurants in Russia. Then Coca-Cola said it was suspending its business there. Within half an hour, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta sent a memo to staff. The company would stop selling Pepsi and 7UP in Russia, he told them, but it wasn't pulling out. </p><p>   \"We must stay true to the humanitarian aspect of our business\" by providing daily essentials such as milk inside Russia, he wrote. \"By continuing to operate, we will also continue to support the livelihoods\" of PepsiCo's Russian employees and thousands of agricultural workers who supply the Russian business with potatoes and milk. </p><p>   Behind the scenes, the company's leaders explored another action it could still take. PepsiCo could write down the value of its Russian business to zero, modeling the process it used for its Venezuelan operations in 2015. The Venezuelan unit is still operating -- and PepsiCo still owns it -- but it doesn't contribute to the company's earnings. </p><p>   BP PLC, one of the Western companies most exposed to Russia, had investments in the country dating back three decades. The British oil giant held a nearly 20% stake in Russian state-controlled oil producer Rosneft. </p><p>   When Russian troops began amassing on Ukraine's border, executives at BP believed they could weather the fallout. In the weeks before the invasion, CEO Bernard Looney told analysts that he'd learned to \"not worry about things until they happen.\" </p><p>   The day after the invasion started, Mr. Looney spoke with Kwasi Kwarteng, the U.K.'s secretary of state for business and energy. The politician made clear the British government was unhappy with BP's Rosneft stake and expected BP to respond, according to people familiar with the matter. </p><p>   BP announced its pullout following an emergency board meeting two days later, becoming one of the first to signal its intention to exit. It warned the move could result in potential losses, including write-downs and charges, totaling up to $25 billion. </p><p>   Before making its decision public, Mr. Looney broke the news to Rosneft's CEO, Igor Sechin, a former KGB operative. BP officials found Mr. Sechin surprisingly understanding, the people said. Mr. Sechin was later among the Putin loyalists whose assets were targeted by Western governments. </p><p>   BP's move set the stage for Shell PLC to then announce it was ending its Russian joint ventures, and to get out of the just-halted Nord Stream 2 pipeline project poised to carry gas into Germany. Within days, Exxon Mobil Corp. said it would shut down production from a giant oil-and-gas project it runs on Russia's Sakhalin Island. </p><p>   Anheuser-Busch InBev SA reported its quarterly results the day the war started. CEO Michel Doukeris had flown from New York to Belgium to host the earnings presentation. He gave interviews to CNBC, The Wall Street Journal and other outlets about the financial results, knowing that they were no longer relevant news. All anyone was talking about was Ukraine. </p><p>   For two months, the Budweiser brewer had a team in Europe working on contingency plans for a conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The company had breweries and employees in both countries, which were also key producers of wheat and barley. </p><p>   By 9 a.m., an AB InBev crisis team was tracking the locations of the company's 1,800 employees in Ukraine along with their families. The crisis team booked hotel rooms near the Polish border and advised employees on the best routes to get there or to other border crossings. </p><p>   AB InBev had 11 breweries in Russia, and was coming under pressure to take a moral stance. First, the company had to talk with Turkish brewer Anadolu Efes, the controlling partner of the companies' joint venture in Ukraine and Russia. </p><p>   Efes wanted to continue its Russian operations to support its 3,500 employees and the farmers who supplied the breweries. AB InBev decided to ringfence the Russian joint venture and forfeit any profit or other financial benefit from it. </p><p>   AB InBev also asked Efes to suspend the license for the production and sale of its Bud brand in Russia. \"Budweiser is a global brand that stands for values,\" Mr. Doukeris said. The company will continue brewing other beers in Russia. </p><p>   Soon after the invasion, some consumers and bartenders started dumping Stolichnaya vodka and other products they associated with Russia. </p><p>   The vodka, however, is produced in Latvia. Damian McKinney, the CEO of Stoli Group, said that the company had previously considered distancing itself from its Russian heritage. Stoli Group and the Russian government have fought for years over the Stolichnaya trademark, which was owned by a state entity during the Soviet Union and changed hands after it was privatized in the 1990s. </p><p>   Stoli Group's Russian founder and chairman, Yuri Shefler, says he has lived outside of Russia since 2002 because of his opposition to Mr. Putin. </p><p>   Mr. McKinney had been watching Russia massing troops on Ukraine's border for weeks before the war. The former Royal Marine had begun gaming out how he might protect the vodka maker from supply-chain issues, including labels and bottle caps made in Ukraine. </p><p>   On the morning of the invasion, Mr. McKinney phoned Mr. Shefler to discuss the company's stance. They agreed that Mr. McKinney would tell the 240 employees who would dial into the monthly town hall later that day that Stoli Group condemned the attack. \"We needed people to understand we were on the good guys' side,\" Mr. McKinney said. </p><p>   Mr. McKinney also decided the time was ripe for Stolichnaya to rebrand. On March 4, the company announced its vodka would change its name to Stoli and it would stop sourcing ethanol used to make the spirit from Russia. </p><p>   The disruption to already-strained global supply lines hit car makers like Volkswagen hard. </p><p>   Average hourly wages of 4 euros, or $4.41, made Ukraine an attractive location for manufacturers of auto components that required many hours of manual labor. Thus wiring harnesses -- which organize the cables inside a car -- took on outsize importance when Ukrainian factories shut and supplies to VW's auto plants dried up. </p><p>   \"I knew what would happen if Ukraine production stopped,\" said Mr. Diess, the Volkswagen boss. \"But we never thought Ukraine would get hit. We thought Northern Africa would be the problem.\" </p><p>   On the night of the invasion, Mr. Diess called an emergency board meeting for the next day. The VW board agreed to duplicate the tools used in the affected plants in Ukraine to help suppliers produce wiring harnesses at sites outside the country. That would take weeks, and parts began to run out in days. </p><p>   Soon after, VW shut production at its main plant in Wolfsburg, Germany. Audi temporarily shut down some production. Porsche had to halt production of its Taycan luxury electric sedan. </p><p>   Some production is coming back online, but it remains patchy. It's yet another challenge for an industry still wrestling with a semiconductor shortage. \"It is going to take suppliers months to sort this out,\" Mr. Diess said. </p><p>   Boeing Co. had employees in Kyiv and Moscow, as well as a longtime relationship with a key Russian titanium supplier led by Sergey Chemezov, an oligarch with close ties to Mr. Putin. The partnership, forged a quarter-century ago, includes a joint venture in the Ural Mountains that fashions aircraft parts hard to replicate elsewhere. </p><p>   Chief Executive David Calhoun made clear the aerospace giant would need to suspend its operations in Russia, including its purchases of titanium from the supplier and their joint venture. Boeing had drawn up plans to get titanium elsewhere after Russia invaded Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula in 2014 and the U.S. first imposed sanctions on Mr. Chemezov, a former KGB official. </p><p>   \"We are a U.S. company and we are going to follow the U.S. government,\" Mr. Calhoun told his leadership team in a videoconference on Feb. 28. \"We need to be closely aligned with our government, regardless of the implications.\" </p><p>   Soon after, Boeing said it would close its office in Moscow. The company also said it would stop sending plane parts to Russian airlines and halt purchases of Russian titanium. The U.S. announced additional sanctions targeting Mr. Chemezov. </p><p>   Twilio Inc. CEO Jeff Lawson and other tech CEOs relayed updates and advice on a shared Slack group as the war escalated. They asked each other whether they should pull out of the country or cease doing business with some entities. </p><p>   They talked about whether it would help Russians on the ground if the companies they ran, especially those that are internet-based applications, continued providing services to help spread factual information about what was going on in the region. </p><p>   \"Do we want to further isolate Russian people from the truth or do we want to do the best we can to ensure a flow of information into Russia?\" said Mr. Lawson, who co-founded Twilio, a cloud-communications company. </p><p>   On March 7, Twilio said it would keep its service in Russia but suspend new business in the country, terminate state-owned customers and block misinformation. The financial cost was negligible, accounting for tens of millions of dollars out of Twilio's roughly $3 billion in revenue last year, Mr. Lawson said. </p><p></p>",
