  "text": "<p>Sanctions against Russia, prohibiting a wide range of financial transactions and exports, have businesses halting sales and other operations there. All that has some companies with deep Russian roots reviewing their interests in the country.</p><p>Apple said Tuesday it stopped selling iPhones and other products in Russia, saying it was \"deeply concerned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\"</p><p>Silicon Valley's tech giants have been facing particular pressure to cut off services and content to Russia. On Friday, Ukraine's vice prime minister, Mykhailo Fedorov, asked Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook to stop supplying Apple products and services to Russia, including halting access to the App Store.</p><p>Boeing said Tuesday that it has suspended parts and maintenance support for Russian airlines and suspended its operations in Moscow, further restricting its ties and adding more barriers to the country's carriers' ability to fly.</p><p>European Union sanctions last week barred parts for Airbus SE and other aircraft being exported to Russia, alongside a ban of Russian carriers from EU airspace. Boeing's move adds to the challenges for Russian airlines to continue operating a fleet of more than 700 Western-built aircraft.</p><p>Ford on Tuesday said it was suspending its joint-venture operations in Russia, citing concern over the invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Volkswagen, meanwhile, said it may shutter its flagship German plant later this month because it can't get parts from suppliers in war-torn Ukraine. Volkswagen had previously idled production at its plant in Zwickau, Germany, its most important factory for producing electric cars, including the ID.4 that is exported to the U.S. Supplies of wiring harnesses -- a kit containing wires, connectors and terminals to connect a car's components -- have been interrupted.</p><p>Although production at Volkswagen's Wolfsburg plant is running normally, the auto maker said it expects more restrictive production next week and that it would be \"unable to manufacture in Wolfsburg\" the week after. Production at its commercial vehicles plant in Hannover would also be impacted, as well as its component factories, the company said.</p><p>Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, the German luxury-car maker, said it had stopped exports of vehicles to Russia and would cease assembly of vehicles with a partner in Kaliningrad.</p><p>\"Due to the current geopolitical situation we will stop our local production and export for the Russian market until further notice,\" a spokesman said. BMW also said that supply-chain disruptions, such as the closure of some supplier plants in Ukraine, would hit production at some factories.</p><p>Dell said it suspended product sales in Russia. Ericsson AB, the Swedish telecom-equipment maker, said it, too, was suspending shipments there.</p><p>The world's biggest container ship operators -- A.P. Moeller-Maersk AS and Mediterranean Shipping Co. -- said they would temporarily suspend services to Russian ports, even those far from the conflict in Ukraine. Maersk said Tuesday it was halting bookings in light of the sanctions imposed on Russia. Both operators said they would continue to move foodstuffs to and from Russia.</p><p>---</p><p>Tim Higgins, Costas Paris and Nora Eckert contributed to this article.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
