  "text": "<p>With Thursday's action, the U.S. list now has 153 commercial and private aircraft, including 146 Russian-owned or operated planes and seven Belarusian ones. This is the first time Belarusian planes were added to the list first released in February.</p><p>\"We will continue working with our allies and partners to cut Russia and Belarus off from the global economy to maximize pressure on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin and his military operations,\" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement.</p><p>Nearly all the planes on the list are made by Boeing Co., and operated by Russian airlines such as Aeroflot and Azur Air, as well as newly added Belavia Belarusian Airlines.</p><p>Officials from Belavia weren't immediately available for comment.</p><p>The export controls bar any aircraft made in the U.S. or those that include more than 25% U.S.-controlled parts from flying into Russia or Belarus without a license issued by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security.</p><p>Companies from around the world are prohibited from providing refueling, maintenance or repair to the aircraft, effectively grounding them.</p><p>The measure was part of a wave of sanctions announced in late February that were intended to cripple Russia's military, economy and elites. They included export controls of goods and technology such as semiconductors, computers and information-security equipment, as well as aircraft components.</p><p>Write to Yuka Hayashi at yuka.hayashi@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Expands Sanctions Against Russian, Belarusian Aircraft</p>",
