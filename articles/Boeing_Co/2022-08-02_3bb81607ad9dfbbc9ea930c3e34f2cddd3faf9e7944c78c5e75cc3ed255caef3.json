  "title": "Stocks See-Saw but End Day Lower --- Some traders now expect Federal Reserve to raise rates more slowly",
  "text": "<p>Stocks fell sharply early Tuesday in Asia as traders reacted to possible volatility in the region resulting from the trip to Taiwan of Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.). The CSI 300, an index tracking mainland Chinese stocks, was down 2.3%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 3% and Japan's Nikkei 225 was down 1.6%. S&amp;P 500 futures fell 0.4%.</p><p>U.S. stocks have mounted a furious recovery in recent weeks, boosted by positive signals from earnings and expectations that the Federal Reserve may not need to raise interest rates as aggressively as once thought, spurring a rally in government bonds alongside stocks.</p><p>\"The market's beginning to price in the end of Fed tightening rather quickly, and I think it's going to be disappointed. I think the market's a bit ahead of itself here,\" said Thomas H. MacCowatt, partner at Williams Jones Wealth Management.</p><p>Last week, officials approved another 0.75-percentage-point interest-rate increase. But traders are now betting that the size of rate increases will be smaller for the rest of the year.</p><p>\"This has been a very rapid repricing of bond and equity markets,\" said Edward Park, chief investment officer at U.K. investment firm Brooks Macdonald. \"I fear, however, it might be a bit premature based on what was said out of the Federal Reserve last week.\"</p><p>Mr. Park noted that Monday's weakness in stock futures suggested investors are likely taking a breather after the S&amp;P 500 finished Friday with a 9.1% gain for July. He added that traders are in \"wait and see\" mode ahead of Friday's jobs report. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect the U.S. economy to have added 250,000 jobs in July, down from 372,000 in June.</p><p>Strong employment is the remaining pillar propping up consumer sentiment and stopping the economy from seeing a \"full-blown recession,\" said Aoifinn Devitt, chief investment officer of Moneta.</p><p>\"We are probably well poised for another good end to the summer,\" Ms. Devitt said.</p><p>Not all investors are feeling optimistic after July's market rally, however.</p><p>\"We expect to have more pain ahead, more downside from here, even if it may take a few weeks to materialize,\" said Chris Wilde, managing director at NEIRG Wealth Management.</p><p>Mr. Wilde noted the recent drop in the 10-year real yield, which represents what investors earn from government bonds after adjusting for inflation, as a sign that the market remains in a \"very tenuous spot.\"</p><p>Enthusiasm among individual investors for riskier assets, such as big-name tech stocks, are also stopping the market from hitting a bottom, he said.</p><p>Investors' expectations for a less aggressive Fed have been evident in federal-funds futures, which are used by traders to place bets on the course of interest rates.</p><p>Such futures on Monday morning showed a nearly 69% probability that the Fed will raise its interest rate by half a percentage point in September, up from 44% last week, according to CME Group. They also are assigning a smaller probability to a 0.75-percentage-point increase compared with a week ago.</p><p>Shifting expectations for central-bank policy for the rest of the year have scrambled other areas of financial markets in recent days, upending some trades that have flourished this year. The dollar, for example, which has staged a prolonged rise in 2022, fell on Monday for a fourth consecutive session, with the WSJ Dollar Index losing 0.4%.</p><p>The Japanese yen, meanwhile, advanced again, rising 1.2% against the dollar. The yen's recent rise has challenged a popular trade on Wall Street this year: betting against the Japanese currency.</p><p>The dollar also fell against the euro and British pound.</p><p>In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note traded at 2.605%, down from 2.642% Friday.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark note has come down significantly from its closing high of 3.482% reached in June.</p><p>The yield on the two-year Treasury note, meanwhile, traded at 2.909%, compared with 2.897% Friday, to keep the yield curve inverted.</p><p>That market signal, which occurs when short-term Treasury yields trade higher than long-term yields, is often seen as a predictor of a recession.</p><p>Boeing gained $9.76, or 6.1%, to $169.07 after the plane maker temporarily avoided a strike at three defense manufacturing plants and cleared a regulatory hurdle for resuming deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner.</p><p>American depositary shares of Alibaba added 97 cents, or 1.1%, to $90.34 after the company said it would work to stay listed on the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday added Alibaba to a list of Chinese companies at risk of being delisted from the U.S. exchanges if their auditors can't be inspected before spring 2024.</p><p>EVO Payments increased $6.37, or 23%, to $33.71 after Global Payments said it would buy the payments-technology company and pay $34 a share in an all-cash deal. Global Payments shares rose $5.66, or 4.6%, to $127.98.</p><p>PerkinElmer rose $7.70, or 5%, to $160.87 after it announced it will sell its applied, food and enterprise services business to private-equity firm New Mountain Capital for $2.45 billion.</p><p>In energy markets, Brent crude lost 3.8% to $100.03 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 finished down 0.2%.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
