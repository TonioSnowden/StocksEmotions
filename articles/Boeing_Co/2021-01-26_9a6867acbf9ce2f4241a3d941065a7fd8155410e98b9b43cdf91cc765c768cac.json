  "text": "<p>Larry Culp, General Electric's chief executive, has defended a potential $46.5m bonus secured in a year when the company <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff7d7827-6d66-41cd-9871-abb51c28384e\">laid off </a>thousands of its staff, saying that he had also made sacrifices because of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c84bde4b-9766-4163-8606-6a29653e1822\">Unions had attacked</a> the board's decision to extend Mr Culp's contract on new terms, which would unlock the bonus in 2024 if GE's stock traded above $10 for at least 30 days rather than the original $19 target. A rally in the stock as GE's performance improved ensured he hit the new goal within a matter of months.</p> <p>Mr Culp defended his incentives on Tuesday, telling the Financial Times that agreeing to the board's request to extend his contract in the midst of the pandemic last August “required a bit of soul-searching on my part, given what I'd agreed to initially”. </p> <p>Mr Culp could receive a bonus of up to $230m if GE's shares trade above $16.68 for a sustained period, rather than the $31 target in his 2018 contract. They were $11.48 on Tuesday, after strong fourth-quarter results.</p> <p>“I didn't take a salary last year once Covid hit. I think we all sacrificed,” he added. “[The board] did not extend to me a bonus for 2020. That contract extension was long term and performance-based. To characterise that as a big cheque I'm taking home at the end of 2020 is at odds with the facts.”</p> <p>GE has not released details of its executives' 2020 compensation but in 2019 Mr Culp earned a base salary of $2.5m, a $5.6m annual bonus and a grant of performance share awards that were valued at the time at $15.5m. </p> <p>Shares in the US industrial conglomerate were up more than 4 per cent in lunchtime trading in New York, close to their level a year ago before GE began to feel the effects of a pandemic that took a particularly heavy toll on its aircraft engines business.</p> <p>It ended a tumultuous year of lay-offs, debt repayments and restructuring with far stronger cash flow than forecast, boosting investor confidence in Mr Culp's turnround.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Improving orders in GE's power and renewable energy division drove industrial free cash flow to almost $4.4bn in the fourth quarter, compared with a target of at least $2.5bn, allowing the company to return to positive cash flow for the full year, 12 months ahead of schedule.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I think we've done a tremendous amount to stabilise and de-risk,” Mr Culp told the FT, pointing to the fact the company had cut $16bn from its debt in 2020. “There's more to do but that's a lot of financial de-risking. Hopefully the speculation about our potential demise is fading.” </p> <p>GE's adjusted earnings for the quarter were down 60 per cent at 8 cents per share, while its preferred measure of industrial organic revenues dropped 14 per cent. Its power, renewable energy and healthcare divisions all reported improved profit margins.&#xa0;</p> <p>For 2021, the group forecast organic revenue growth “in the low-single-digit range”, an improvement in industrial profit margins of 250 basis points or more and adjusted earnings per share of 15 to 25 cents. Industrial free cash flow should reach $2.5bn to $4.5bn, it said, compared with market expectations of about $3bn.</p> <p>GE cut more than $2bn from its cost base in 2020 including thousands of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ff7d7827-6d66-41cd-9871-abb51c28384e\">job losses in the aviation business</a>, which supplies Boeing and has been <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b79114a5-cf61-486a-9488-6a9e833490fb\">hit</a> by the grounding of flights around the world during the pandemic.&#xa0;</p> <p>Aviation orders were down 40 per cent year-on-year in the fourth quarter but GE said the division had come close to generating positive free cash flow in the period. Its healthcare division, which reported a surge in demand for ventilators and monitors for Covid-19 patients earlier in 2020, was experiencing the return of more normal demand patterns, Mr Culp said. </p> <p>He added GE had ended the year with an order backlog of $387bn, down 4 per cent year-on-year but heavily skewed towards services, where it makes its highest profit margins.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p><p>Source: Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson 2021 'GE's Larry Culp cites pandemic sacrifice to defend $47m bonus ' FT.com 26 January.
