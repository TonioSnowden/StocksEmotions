  "title": "Boeing Jet Orders Shrink After Russia Sanctions; U.S. plane maker determines it can no longer count orders for about 90 jets following Russia's invasion of Ukraine",
  "text": "<p>Boeing said it could no longer count about 90 of its outstanding orders for commercial jets as firm purchase agreements, or about 2% of its overall backlog, under accounting rules. In all, Boeing counted 141 net orders as no longer firm in March.</p><p>European plane maker Airbus SE last week said it had canceled two orders for its A350 wide-body jets for Russia's flagship carrier Aeroflot as a result of sanctions. Airbus, which uses different accounting standards to Boeing, still has 13 outstanding orders for the aircraft from Aeroflot on its books.</p><p>Boeing, for its part, has suspended its deep ties with a major Russian titanium supplier, with which the plane maker had launched a joint venture to develop key airplane parts. Boeing also has halted selling spare parts and maintenance services to Russian airlines that operate its jets.</p><p>The U.S. and European countries have closed their airspace to Russian aircraft, while Russian carriers have avoided operating foreign-leased aircraft outside of its borders to prevent lessors seizing the assets. Lessors have scrapped rental agreements with Russian airlines for hundreds of aircraft in the wake of newly imposed Western sanctions.</p><p>Boeing said it booked a total of 38 net new orders for new commercial jets in March, many of them 737 MAX narrow-body jets.</p><p>The plane maker said it delivered 41 jets last month. Deliveries included 34 MAX jets as well as a mix of freighters and military variants of its commercial jets.</p><p>Benjamin Katz contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing Jet Orders Shrink After Russia Sanctions</p>",
