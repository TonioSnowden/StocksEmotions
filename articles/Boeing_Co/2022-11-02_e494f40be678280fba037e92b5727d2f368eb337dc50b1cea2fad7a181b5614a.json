  "text": "<p>Benjamin Netanyahu is on the verge of securing a dramatic comeback in Israel after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e2b91dfc-c5a4-47da-aca8-03533beb36af\">yesterday's parliamentary elections</a>, according to exit polls that give his rightwing bloc a razor-thin majority. </p> <p>Polls by Israel's three main television channels, released after voting closed, forecast that a bloc combining Netanyahu's Likud party, the extreme-right Religious Zionism grouping and two ultra-Orthodox parties that have traditionally backed Netanyahu would win 61 to 62 seats in the 120-seat Knesset.</p> <p>The Yesh Atid party of Prime Minister Yair Lapid and several smaller allies were forecast to win 54 to 55 seats between them, while the non-aligned Arab Hadash-Ta'al grouping was predicted four mandates. </p> <p>Final results will depend on whether various small parties, including the Arab nationalist grouping Balad and the leftwing Meretz, clear the 3.25 per cent electoral threshold.</p> <p>But with 80 per cent of votes counted, the former prime minister was on course to return to power less than 18 months after he was ousted by Lapid's sprawling eight-party coalition, thanks to a large extent to a strong showing from Religious Zionism and its figurehead Itamar Ben Gvir, a once-fringe ultranationalist previously convicted of incitement to racism.</p> <p>Amid jubilant scenes at the Likud party headquarters, with supporters chanting “Bibi, king of Israel”, Netanyahu said he would form a “stable, national government”. “We are on the brink of a great victory,” he said.</p> <p>Lapid, meanwhile, urged its supporters not to give up hope, telling them that “nothing is final” until the last vote is counted.</p> <p>Yesterday's election is Israel's fifth in three-and-a-half years of political stalemate, and, like the previous four, was widely seen as a referendum on 73-year-old Netanyahu, a divisive figure who has ruled Israel for 15 of the past 26 years.</p> <p><em>Thank you to every reader who voted in yesterday's poll. It was evenly split, with 49 per cent believing a windfall tax would discourage investment and 42 per cent saying it was time to tax Big Oil more. Nine per cent were undecided. Please keep your views coming to firstft@ft.com and I may feature them in a future edition of FirstFT — Gordon</em></p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Exclusive:</strong> <strong>Qatar plans to increase Credit Suisse stake</strong> Qatar's sovereign wealth fund plans to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/83eb48ed-1856-4ec3-99c9-86646f462d64\">invest in Credit Suisse's share sale</a> alongside the Saudi National Bank, according to people with knowledge of the talks. The deal will result in Middle Eastern investors owning up to a quarter of the Swiss bank's stock, as it seeks to raise SFr4bn ($4bn) to fund a radical restructuring.</p> <p><strong>2. Musk outlines Twitter premium subscription plan </strong>Elon Musk has proposed a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c2b147a-864c-475c-8d0f-7f1dcf534e5a\">premium $8-a-month subscription service</a> that will verify users, boost the visibility of their posts and allow them to see fewer advertisements, in his first step towards overhauling the social media platform since he took the reins last week.</p> <p><strong>3. Jair Bolsonaro vows to follow Brazil's constitution</strong> Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/00201127-baec-47e7-877e-60c18c64fbe5\">broke a two-day silence</a> after his narrow election defeat on Sunday and vowed to follow the country's constitution and peacefully hand over power to his leftist rival Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. But it remained unclear whether Bolsonaro's supporters would halt their protests.</p> <p><strong>4. Top US trade official urges EU to join forces on subsidies</strong> Katherine Tai, Washington's most senior trade official, has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e52d609-5cfe-453c-9baf-b33b66e941e9\">called on the EU to introduce its own subsidies</a> for green technology while offering a trenchant defence of Joe Biden's package of measures to support the sector. Critics say the $369bn package unfairly supports the US's own manufacturers.</p> <p><strong>5. Netflix prepares to launch ad-supported streaming</strong> Netflix's new advertisement-supported service will launch tomorrow <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f21e934d-acbe-4c4b-ac15-a3a6460abdd2\">without the full range of programmes</a> found on its premium platform. Company officials say shows that receive 85 to 90 per cent of the viewing time spent on the service will be available, including popular fare such as <em>The Crown</em>, while they continue to negotiate with the Hollywood studios<em>.</em></p> <h1>The day ahead</h1> <p><strong>US interest rates </strong>The Federal Reserve is set to raise its benchmark policy rate by 0.75 percentage points today <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2fba4664-a496-4a5b-820e-f258b3e2bd81\">for the fourth time in a row</a>, as it continues its long-running battle to bring down persistently high US inflation.</p> <p><strong>Earnings</strong> Yum Brands, the corporate parent of Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut fast food franchises, is forecasted to report a revenue decline when it reveals third-quarter earnings before the bell. Robinhood will update investors on its strategy <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/926024de-bccb-4371-880c-c198b89e82fc\">following recent job cuts</a>. Other earnings before the bell include&#xa0;CVS, Estée Lauder, Ferrari, Apollo Global Management, Rockwell Automation and The New York Times. They will be followed after the market closes by Qualcomm, Booking Holdings, MetLife, Allstate, Continental Resources, eBay, Marathon Oil, MGM Resorts, Etsy, Zillow, Hostess Brands and Vista Outdoor.</p> <p><strong>Boeing investor day</strong> Boeing will host an investor day in Seattle, one week after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bf0a52b5-ed1b-46ce-bc8e-9ea7d1c09910\">disclosing $2.8bn in losses</a> in its defence business and a slower-than-expected production rate for the narrow-body 737 Max jet. </p> <p><strong>Midterm elections</strong> President Joe Biden travels to New Mexico to campaign for Democratic governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. He will also deliver remarks on student debt relief. Former president Barack Obama is scheduled to appear in the key swing state of Arizona to campaign for Democratic incumbent senator Mark Kelly.</p> <h1>What else we're reading</h1> <p><strong>How Arizona became ground zero for election deniers </strong>When Donald Trump and his supporters disputed the result of the 2020 presidential election, the complex architecture of election administration came under unprecedented scrutiny, as conspiracists jumped on every detail of the process in an attempt to cast doubt on its legitimacy. <a href=\"https://ig.ft.com/arizona-election-deniers/\">Nowhere was this more pronounced than in Arizona</a>. </p> <p><strong>Geopolitics is the biggest threat to globalisation </strong>How might globalisation end? Some seem to imagine a relatively peaceful “decoupling” of economies, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8954a5f8-8f03-4044-8401-f1efefe9791b\">writes Martin Wolf</a>. But it is likely that the fracturing will be both consequence and cause of deepening global discord. If so, a more destructive end is likely.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/1730244.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a> <p><strong>The cost of getting South Africa to stop using coal</strong> Coal accounts for about 85 per cent of South Africa's electricity. With income per capita of roughly $7,000, the country is also one of the most inefficient at turning fossil fuels into economic output. But that means there are quick wins to be had if finance can be found to help South Africa — and countries like it — <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c64950c-2154-4757-bf25-d93c7850be8f\">transition more quickly to clean energy</a>.</p> <p><strong>There is no need for defeatism on climate change </strong>The reasons not to be cheerful on climate change are obvious, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/acec3a48-ca81-4af2-8a0d-f21435cb664b\">writes Pilita Clark</a>. So what grounds are there for optimism? One big reason: governments and regulators are finally getting serious, and taking unprecedented steps that would have been unthinkable even a year ago.</p> <p><strong>Ukraine raid heralds new era of naval drone warfare</strong> An audacious, long-distance assault by unmanned exploding boats on Russia's Black Sea fleet over the weekend, with multiple unmanned explosive vessels penetrating a supposedly protected harbour, provide a “<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/41cee444-d783-4e99-b882-29c75e9dd5a3\">glimpse into the future of naval warfare</a>”, says a defence analyst.</p> <h1>Gaming</h1> <p>Poetry and video games might not seem like natural bedfellows, but a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e582044-f0b6-4aae-8303-76129c7b8cbc\">London exhibition</a> is exploring the overlaps and surprising similarities between the two forms.</p><p>Source: Gordon Smith, Gary Jones and Emily Goldberg  2022 'FirstFT: Netanyahu on cusp of comeback' FT.com 2 November.
