  "text": "<p>While it held on to plans to increase production of its bestselling narrow-body family to 75 a month in 2025, it said production would increase more slowly through 2023. Rates for that aircraft, the A320, will now only reach a rate of 65 a month in early 2024, about six months behind schedule. Rates are currently at about 50 a month.</p><p>\"We are late on the trajectory we had given to ourselves,\" Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said on a call with reporters, citing the supply-chain challenges. \"We are trying to go as fast as we can.\"</p><p>Both Airbus and rival Boeing Co. have been battling with parts and engine shortages as manufacturers try to quickly meet resurgent demand for commercial aircraft. Airbus has complained that it can't make its aircraft quickly enough. Sales boss Christian Scherer said in an interview last week that its A320 family of aircraft was now sold out until 2028.</p><p>Similar to the strains facing airlines and airports, aerospace suppliers are battling to bring on board staff let go at the outset of the pandemic when both of the world's biggest airframers cut output. Raw material shortages and higher inflation are also weighing on supply chains, Mr. Faury said.</p><p>One of the biggest bottlenecks has been the supply of engines, with both CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Co. and France's Safran SA, and Pratt &amp; Whitney, a division of Raytheon Technologies Corp. -- the two engine providers for the A320 -- running behind schedule. The delays have led Airbus to produce and store 26 so-called \"gliders,\" ready-built aircraft waiting for turbines, as at the end of June. The CEO said he expects that backlog to clear by the end of the year.</p><p>\"In terms of production, we can do more than this, the fact that we have gliders shows that the production rate at Airbus is capable of more. But we need the parts, we need the equipment, we need the engines in particular,\" Mr. Faury said. \"It's the supply chain that is the bottleneck.\"</p><p>Aside from its narrow-body hurdle, the company said it is exploring with its suppliers the idea of raising rates on its wide-body programs, citing increased demand for bigger jets that are used primarily on long-haul and international routes amid the easing of Covid-19 travel restrictions. Airbus said Wednesday it booked net income of 1.9 billion euros, or about $1.92 in the first half, down 15% from 2.2 billion euros a year earlier. Revenue rose about 1% to 24.8 billion euros.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
