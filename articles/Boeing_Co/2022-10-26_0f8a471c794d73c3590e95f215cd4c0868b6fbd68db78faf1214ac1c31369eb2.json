  "text": "<p>The company said it generated $2.9 billion in free cash in the third quarter, keeping it on track to end the year with positive cash flow.</p><p>The per-share of loss of $5.49 compared with a 19-cent deficit a year earlier.</p><p>Boeing shares rose around 1% in pre-market trading early Wednesday.</p><p>Chief Executive David Calhoun said the company was making strides in its turnaround effort but still faced challenges. The company has faced a series of engineering, manufacturing and regulatory problems since two of its 737 MAX jets crashed in 2018 and 2019, taking 346 lives.</p><p>\"Turnarounds take time—and we have more work to do—but I am confident in our team and the actions we're taking for the future,\" he said in an internal message to employees Wednesday.</p><p>The company's commercial jet business has dealt with supply chain disruptions, including for new engines, that have hindered deliveries of 737 jets.</p><p>It also has faced regulatory hurdles with the latest versions of the 737, the shorter MAX 7 and longer MAX 10 models. Both have a year-end legal deadline to win certification by U.S. air-safety regulators. Without a congressional extension of that deadline, federal law may require Boeing to make costly and time-consuming overhauls to the airplanes' cockpits.</p><p>Write to Andrew Tangel at andrew.tangel@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing Reports $3.3 Billion Loss, Weighed Down By Defense Unit Charges</p>",
