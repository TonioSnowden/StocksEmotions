  "title": "American Airlines Trims More International Flights as Boeing Dreamliner Delays Drag On; The carrier is again cutting its summer schedule as production problems at Boeing hold up delivery of new 787s",
  "text": "<p>The Dreamliner delays have hindered American's plans to restore international flying this coming summer. Airlines are hoping that the receding Omicron variant and easing global travel restrictions will mean a rebound in long-haul flying.</p><p>A Boeing spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. The plane maker has previously said it deeply regrets the impact to its customers as it works through the process to resume deliveries.</p><p>Boeing has largely halted handing over the wide-body jets to its customers since October 2020 as it addresses a series of manufacturing flaws.</p><p>American, which had originally planned to have 13 new Dreamliners for this summer's schedule, first trimmed its plans in December but had planned on flying passengers with four new 787s that it had expected to receive in the spring.</p><p>Now, the Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier is removing those remaining four new Dreamliners from its summer schedule, according to one of the people familiar with the decision.</p><p>United Airlines Holdings Inc. said last month that it doesn't expect to receive its eight new Dreamliners until after summer. It had previously expected to take deliveries of those planes in the second half of 2021.</p><p>Derek Kerr, American's chief financial officer, said last month the carrier could seek additional compensation from Boeing for any further delivery delays.</p><p>\"If there are further delays, and it really does impact the summer much more than what we think it is, then we've had good discussions with Boeing that they will compensate us for the losses that we've had for the delay of those aircraft,\" he said during an earnings conference call.</p><p>Boeing isn't expected to resume delivering new Dreamliners until the spring or summer, longer than previously anticipated, people familiar with the matter said. The company has declined to estimate when it would resume handing over new 787s, saying U.S. air-safety regulators control the timing.</p><p>Earlier this week, the Federal Aviation Administration said it had decided that its inspectors would individually check each Dreamliner once Boeing restarts deliveries, rather than allowing the plane maker to perform the routine work as it had done in the past.</p><p>Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com and Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com</p><p>American Airlines Trims More International Flights as Boeing Dreamliner Delays Drag On</p>",
