  "title": "Boeing's stock falls after UBS analyst Myles Walton cuts price target, but says expectations have ‘bottomed out'",
  "text": "<p>But Walton maintained the buy rating he's had on the aerospace and defense giant's stock since December 2020, as he believes investor expectations have “bottomed out.”</p><p>The stock BA slumped 1.7% in afternoon trading. It has extended its lead as the Dow Jones Industrial Average's DJIA worst performer over the past three months, as it has tumbled 15.1% while the Dow has gained 1.6%. The next biggest Dow decliner over the past three months is Caterpillar Inc.'s stock CAT, which has shed 12.6%.</p><p>Walton cut his price target to $290, which is about 35% above current levels, from $310. He also cut his 2021 sales estimate by 10% to $67.53 billion, which compares with the FactSet consensus of $75.17 billion. He now expects “just a dozen” 787 jet deliveries by the end of the year.</p><p>FactSet, MarketWatchThe price target and estimate cuts come after The Wall Street Journal reported over the weekend, citing people familiar wit h the matter, that deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner were likely to remain halted until at least late October amid continued regulator concerns over safety. Read more about 787 delivery delays.</p><p>“From our conversations with investors, we sense very little in the way of expectations built into [Boeing's] shares on a big performance turnaround before the end of the year,” Walton wrote in a note to clients. “We also sense the name is among the least owned of the large-cap cyclicals given the obvious overhangs.”</p><p>With that in mind, he said that it's hard to quantify at what point investor expectations have hit bottom, “but this sure feels like it” for Boeing's stock.</p><p>Walton said the potential biggest upside catalysts for Boeing's stock are if Boeing's 737 MAX planes are recertified in China and the eventual restart of 787 deliveries.</p>",
