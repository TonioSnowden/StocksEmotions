Lloyds profits rose to £1.9bn from less than £100m in the same quarter last year.&#xa0;</p> <p>At <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ddd53802-2352-48ec-a15d-b2fc3b9da058\">HSBC</a>, which also benefited from reducing reserves earmarked for bad loans, as well as the improving global outlook, profits surged 79 per cent to $5.8bn.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5e8f05a1-e37c-4f1f-b1da-dcc13e566a98\">Santander</a> was also able to slash provisions for loan defaults, reporting a jump in quarterly net profits to €1.6bn from €331m last year, its strongest performance in 10 years.</p> <p>Despite the upbeat nature of today's announcements, bank chiefs were careful to voice caution on future prospects, saying they were dependent on defeating Covid-19.&#xa0;</p> <p>Ana Botín, Santander executive chair, emphasised that “the success of the vaccine rollout remains critically important to economic recovery”, while Ewen Stevenson, chief financial officer at HSBC, said there were still “huge risks on the horizon, particularly new super-variants that might be vaccine-resistant”. Stevenson offered the surge in cases in India as a good example of why the bank was still holding on to 70 per cent of the loan-loss provisions made in 2020.</p> <h2>Global economy</h2> <p>US President <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/bedd3913-4a08-4824-b6d3-cb5440b1ccaa\">Joe Biden</a> is set to follow his $1.9tn fiscal stimulus bill and $2.3tn infrastructure plans with $1.8tn of proposals for an “American Families Plan” to expand his country's <strong>social safety net</strong>. The president delivers his first State of the Union speech at 9pm ET today, while Federal Reserve chair <strong>Jay Powell</strong> will give an update on monetary policy at 2pm ET: here are <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c14c3d31-b665-44f3-8786-53449604e3a7\">four things to watch out for</a>.</p> <p>Optimism over the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e8e1d0ea-5b6e-451a-8c6d-2529ba1a65d2\">UK economic outlook</a> may be growing but official data on the profitability of <strong>manufacturers</strong> show the extent of the damage done by the Covid-19 crisis, recording a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1766c574-cd5e-4d39-9f29-7bb8e86bb08b\">decade low</a> in 2020 thanks to a “unique cocktail of circumstances”, including the hit from Brexit and pandemic costs. Profits in the country's dominant services sector remained relatively stable, despite coronavirus lockdowns.</p> <p>During the pandemic, <strong>China</strong> became the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8ccb0f0d-e64c-4132-b4fb-ab886f4672e9\">EU's largest trading partner</a>, intensifying a trend that has led to two-way growth between them surging 67 per cent in the past decade. Human rights concerns are, however, making European companies reassess the relationship. France and Germany, meanwhile, are pushing for swift <strong>Brussels approval</strong> of EU member states' coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cddf15ba-4408-4b57-b927-9694bb5b1899\">recovery plans</a>. </p> <h2>Business</h2> <p>A flurry of first-quarter announcements gave some telling insights into the state of the <strong>UK recovery</strong>. Revenues at drugmaker <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/049ec51e-521f-4c8a-b25e-e93b821a5e76\">GSK</a> were down 18 per cent as the global focus on Covid vaccinations meant fewer sales for products such as its Shingrix shingles shot; supermarket group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/268725a4-e965-4f5e-94bf-3a2d3ca5d334\">J Sainsbury</a> reported increased sales during lockdown but took a hit from Covid-related charges; tech retailer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0e927509-623f-4f75-b37a-50aae10569e4#post-7a9e5ff0-699b-4167-af8e-afc0a19c22fb\">Dixons</a> said online sales of electrical goods doubled but airport stores hit by the standstill in international travel were still set to close; <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67fd6d9f-780f-4438-9559-a7d970440cc7\">WPP</a>, the world's biggest advertising group, reported increased sales as ad spending picked up; and consumer products group <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b56a3252-0a70-4715-8a43-8cd5f8cbc8f0\">Reckitt Benckiser</a> profited from the surge in disinfectant use during the pandemic.</p> <p><strong>Japan</strong> is considering <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f650c035-4e87-406d-9b8a-7b298146450f\">legalising gambling</a> on football and baseball in a move that could create a betting market worth more than $65bn a year. Japanese sport has been hit badly by the coronavirus crisis, losing $2.5bn in the first six months of 2020, according to one estimate. </p> <p><strong>Sony</strong> hit a new annual profits record for the April 2020 to March 2021 year, thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ea46f10f-8fe0-4e8b-827d-a25be65dba77\">gaming boom</a> during the pandemic, but warned that the global chip shortage was likely to continue for the next 12 months. The FT's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97672f16-c1e3-48c0-ab92-1fca9341999a\">Lex column</a> offers a note of caution on future prospects.</p> <h2>Markets</h2> <p>The boom in commodities continues as investors look for assets that will flourish as the global economy recovers. Demand for <strong>iron ore</strong> has hit records as Chinese <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4b3aed47-c049-41c6-ad87-0cfaabf6a7b3\">steel production</a> ramps up, while prices for copper — the world's most important industrial metal — are also at near-record levels. </p> <p>Demand for <strong>cheese</strong> on the Chicago futures market is soaring as traders salivate over the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03f3eb4f-d794-4717-b421-a8f97c04c276\">reopening</a> of the US economy. Pizza and burger outlets have kept sales steady during the pandemic but the prospect of pent-up demand for restaurant visits and the advent of the outdoor grilling season are driving prices to new heights.</p> <p>The <strong>Vix index</strong>, a measure of US stock market volatility often referred to as Wall Street's “fear gauge”, has hit its lowest levels since early in the pandemic as investors become <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11aac6e4-f106-452d-bb4b-097e3e94e86e\">increasingly optimistic</a> about the forward march of the American economy.</p> <h2>Have your say</h2> <p>Myrna D. Belfess comments on <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9e6c0f6f-6a40-49fc-b10f-f1aeca2e4c88?commentID=a1eb0fbe-eec2-427e-a294-460716e9f5d9\">Sick of Zoom? Lucky you don't need it to save the planet</a></p> <blockquote>  <p>Most of the interesting work in conferences gets done in side-chats, over drinks, by casually bumping into someone one met at another conference (the flying-circus effect) 10 years ago. The loss of intellectual productivity is enormous. It would be too much to expect to return to normal quickly, but you have to expect the pandemic effect to wane in the medium term. Cost-cutters will have their say, but beware of a two-tier set-up where the bigwigs travel and the junior are stuck with Zoom. Not only is travel a welcome distraction from the daily grind, it is also a way for the underlings to build rapport with the brass.</p> </blockquote> <h2>Final thought</h2> <p>Non-stop TV coverage of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cda56565-edab-48f9-903d-3bdc26e0e3f7\">football</a> was a nice distraction during lockdown but could never be a substitute for the communal thrill of attending a live game. Jonathan Derbyshire was among the fans returning to their natural habitat at Wembley last weekend. </p> <p><em>We would really like to hear from you.
