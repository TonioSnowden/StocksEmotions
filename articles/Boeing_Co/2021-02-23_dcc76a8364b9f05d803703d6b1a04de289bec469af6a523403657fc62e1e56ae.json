  "text": "<p>The MAX was finally cleared late last year to fly after being grounded for nearly two years and Spirit hopes to benefit from a ramp-up in production at the planemaker.</p><p>Shares of Spirit were down 3% in early morning trading as the company also reported a fall in fourth-quarter shipments to its other major customer, Airbus .</p><p>\"2020 was one of the most challenging years in aviation history. For Spirit, the 737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic created a dual-crisis,\" Spirit Chief Executive Officer Tom Gentile said.</p><p>Spirit's total deliveries of shipsets, or complete sets of parts, fell 48.9% to 231 units in the fourth quarter. Boeing 737 MAX deliveries fell to 19 shipsets from 153 a year earlier.</p><p>Airbus last week forecast flat deliveries in 2021 as it braces for more coronavirus-induced uncertainty in the wake of an annual loss. Boeing has yet to set out detailed targets.</p><p>Spirit posted a loss of $295.9 million, or $2.85 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $67.7 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier.</p><p>On an adjusted basis, the company lost $1.31 per share.
