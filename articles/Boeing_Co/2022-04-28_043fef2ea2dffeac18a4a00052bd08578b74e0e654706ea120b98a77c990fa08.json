  "title": "Air Travel Is Back, But Airlines Struggle to Handle the Surge; Staffing shortages, higher fuel prices and aircraft delivery delays threaten airlines' summer rebound",
  "text": "<p>Aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and General Electric Co., which makes jet engines, this week highlighted the travel rebound. Google parent Alphabet Inc. said travel searches were above what the company saw in the prepandemic first quarter of 2019.</p><p>Southwest Airlines Co. on Thursday was the latest carrier to predict it will again become profitable in the current quarter, and through the rest of 2022.</p><p>Like other airlines, Southwest reported a loss in the first three months of the year, a period that included setbacks from the Omicron variant's initial surge. The rise in cases resulted in a $380 million reduction in revenue as bookings slowed and people canceled flights. Bad weather and staffing challenges resulted in another $50 million hit to the airline's revenue. Southwest lost $278 million during the quarter.</p><p>Southwest, however, was profitable in March, and its revenue per available seat mile during the quarter––a measure of how much the airline makes flying a seat a mile––exceeded 2019 levels for the first time since the pandemic began.</p><p>Airlines' expectations that they will make money in 2022 after two years of steep losses marks a turning point in their recovery from the pandemic. Appetite for travel shriveled to nearly nothing in 2020, as lockdowns, travel restrictions and fear of infection kept people home.</p><p>The travel rebound has been robust, with daily traffic at U.S. airports off less than 10% from comparable days in 2019. People are traveling more for leisure than they did before the pandemic, with spring and summer bookings setting records.</p><p>Even business travel, which has been slower to return, is showing signs of life, airline executives have said. Momentum in corporate bookings has reversed before when companies changed course on bringing employees back to offices, but airlines say business travel volumes have reached their highest levels since the pandemic began.</p><p>Southwest said it expects corporate travel revenues this month to come in at about 70% of what they were in April 2019, with continued improvement in May and June. American Airlines Group Inc. said last week that business travel revenue is on track to reach 90% of 2019 levels in the current quarter.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What is most meaningful to you in Southwest's earnings report? Join the conversation below.</p><p>For airlines, the challenge will be handling the surge.</p><p>Carriers have been tempering growth plans as they contend with staffing shortages. Prices for fuel, one of airlines' biggest costs, are soaring. And aircraft delivery delays are also restraining airlines' ability to offer as many flights as demand might warrant.</p><p>Southwest Chief Executive Bob Jordan said the airline is focused on the basics, with adequate staffing and reliable operations as the top priorities. Southwest said it recently trimmed flight schedules for June, July and August to provide an additional buffer given continued staffing issues.</p><p>JetBlue Airways Corp. came into the year planning to grow its schedule by as much as 15% above 2019 levels. But the airline ran into problems this month: bad weather in Florida resulted in air traffic slowdowns that threw its operation off track. Turnover in key employee groups including pilots and customer service agents has been high.</p><p>Airline executives realized they had to cut back to focus on hiring and training. The slowdown will help the airline fix its operation, but will also delay its return to profitability, JetBlue Chief Executive Robin Hayes said earlier this week.</p><p>\"This is the first time that I can remember where we'll be flying less capacity in June than April. It's a much more conservative planning assumption,\" Mr. Hayes said in an interview.</p><p>Alaska Air Group Inc. and Spirit Airlines Inc. have also shrunk schedules in recent weeks, while United Airlines Holdings Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. said they had planned more conservatively to avoid having to make similar calls.</p><p>\"We're realizing that the whole infrastructure is not set up to snap back to these rapid growth rates,\" United Chief Executive Scott Kirby said last week.</p><p>Airlines are hoping to avoid the problems that several of them encountered last summer, when demand returned more quickly than they had anticipated and before they could rebuild their ranks. What should have been routine disruptions such as poor weather became dayslong snafus. Travelers faced cancellations, delays and hours of long waits for customer service help by phone.</p><p>Airlines got billions of dollars in government funds during the pandemic to continue paying workers so they could avoid massive layoffs. But facing a murky outlook, carriers also encouraged thousands to retire early and take buyouts.</p><p>Southwest said Thursday it has increased its head count by 3,300 in the first three months of the year, and other airlines have been adding thousands of workers as well. But chokepoints are emerging.</p><p>The pandemic accelerated a shortage of pilots that has been looming over the industry for years. Airlines are trying to bring on pilots at a faster clip than ever before, but training infrastructure can't keep pace.</p><p>The result has been fierce competition for the pool of available pilots. Smaller regional airlines have had to cut routes, unable to keep pace with hiring by bigger airlines. JetBlue cited turnover among pilots as one of the reasons it is throttling back growth this year.</p><p>\"Some of the high levels of attrition that we've seen could stay or even get worse,\" Mr. Hayes said.</p><p>Alaska Airlines is halfway to its goal of hiring 600 mainline pilots this year, Chief Executive Ben Minicucci said last week. The challenge is getting them all trained and ready to fly. The airline never caught up after Omicron slowed training at the start of the year, and found itself this month with about 60 fewer pilots than it had planned on, not enough to fly the schedule it had planned.</p><p>\"Pilots were stuck in the schoolhouse,\" Mr. Minicucci said last week. \"We're just putting a little more conservatism into the plan.\"</p><p>Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com</p><p>Air Travel Is Back, But Airlines Struggle to Handle the Surge</p>",
