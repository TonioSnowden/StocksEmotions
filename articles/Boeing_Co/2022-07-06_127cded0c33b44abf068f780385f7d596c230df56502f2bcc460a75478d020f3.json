  "title": "U.S. Law Firm to Represent Russian Oligarch Roman Abramovich as U.S. Seeks to Seize His Planes; Kobre & Kim to advise billionaire as other firms shy away from Russian clients over war in Ukraine",
  "text": "<p>U.S. law requires disclosure to the Justice Department of political work done on behalf of foreign governments, entities or people. Mr. Abramovich hired the firm to help with legal advice and isn't looking to use it for government lobbying, according to a person familiar with the matter. He isn't sanctioned in the U.S., but U.S. authorities filed a warrant last month to seize two aircraft owned by him because they said he breached U.S. sanctions by flying to Russia.</p><p>The U.S. said a Boeing Co. 787 Dreamliner and a Gulfstream jet owned by Mr. Abramovich made the flights in February without first getting a required U.S. export license.</p><p>A person close to Mr. Abramovich said the flights in question were taken at the behest of Ukrainian officials to help broker humanitarian corridors, an activity that was known to U.S. intelligence.</p><p>\"As our client is recognized for his involvement in the peace negotiationsas well as humanitarian efforts, a due and fair process in relation to any legal or administrative matters is essential to ensure his efforts are not hindered,\" the firm said.</p><p>Kobre &amp; Kim appears to be the first known firm to register as a foreign agent on behalf of a Russian oligarch since the war began. A number of U.S. public-relations, consulting and law firms have sought to separate themselves from Russian clients to protect their reputations and avoid the challenges of representing sanctioned clients, legal experts said.</p><p>\"Kobre &amp; Kim is pleased to offer its assistance in matters of legal importance to ensure the law is fairly applied,\" said the New York-based firm, which does work across the globe. It has represented a number of other high-profile clients including Jho Low, the businessman-turned-fugitive accused of masterminding a multibillion-dollar fraud involving Malaysia's sovereign-wealth fund.</p><p>Seeking compensation for legal services from someone who faces or could face U.S. sanctions makes taking on such clients potentially more challenging, as the Treasury Department typically requires law firms to apply for a special license to be paid, said David Laufman, a partner at Wiggin and Dana who previously oversaw Foreign Agents Registration Act and sanctions enforcement at the Justice Department.</p><p>\"Some firms don't want to go through that hassle, and other firms may assess that, in the current political climate, there is reputational risk in continuing to maintain client relations with individuals who either have been sanctioned or appear to be in the crosshairs\" of the Treasury Department, Mr. Laufman said.</p><p>Since the start of the war Mr. Abramovich has positioned himself as a middleman between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Ukrainian government. The oligarch, who made a fortune acquiring oil and metal assets in the 1990s, was initially involved in shuttling messages between the warring factions during abortive peace talks earlier in the year, people familiar with the matter say. He also helped negotiate civilian evacuations and prisoner swaps, according to people familiar with the matter. In early March Mr. Abramovich and other Ukrainian peace negotiators suffered suspected poisoning but made a full recovery.</p><p>On account of his role as a fixer, the U.S. held off sanctioning him after a request from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The U.K. government, however, ignored a plea from the Ukrainian government and sanctioned Mr. Abramovich, as did the European Union, citing the Russian's close ties to Mr. Putin.</p><p>Mr. Abramovich has filed a case against the EU to unfreeze his assets, according to a court filing. But the oligarch has so far held off appealing his sanctioning in the U.K., according to a person familiar with the matter.</p><p>Mr. Abramovich's motivations for facilitating peace in Ukraine have long been debated. While serving as a de facto emissary, he was also shuffling his assets to try to keep them out of reach of U.K. and European sanctions, including changing ownership of a key investment vehicle and moving his yachts out of U.S. and European jurisdictions.</p><p>The U.S. court document said Mr. Abramovich moved ownership of an investment vehicle that controlled his Boeing and Gulfstream jets into his children's ownership \"in or about\" February. Russia re-invaded Ukraine that month.</p><p>People close to the oligarch said he wants to bring the war to an end and stop the bloodshed. They said he continues to advise on humanitarian issues in Ukraine.</p><p>Aruna Viswanatha contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Sadie Gurman at sadie.gurman@wsj.com and Max Colchester at max.colchester@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Law Firm to Represent Russian Oligarch Roman Abramovich as U.S. Seeks to Seize His Planes</p>",
