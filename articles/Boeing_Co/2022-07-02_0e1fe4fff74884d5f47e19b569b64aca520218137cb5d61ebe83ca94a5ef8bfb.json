  "title": "EXCHANGE --- Airbus Wins China Jet Order Valued at $37 Billion",
  "text": "<p>Boeing lost out to rival Airbus in the order disclosed Friday, though that doesn't preclude a follow-up deal for the U.S. company's jets. China Southern Airlines Co. -- the biggest customer of Boeing's troubled 737 MAX in China -- was among three airlines to buy Airbus jets. China Southern, Air China Ltd. and China Eastern Airlines Corp. are set to take delivery of a total of 292 new aircraft starting in 2023, the companies said in separate statements. Together, the deals are valued at $37 billion before customary discounts given to airlines, according to the statements.</p><p>When Covid-19 first emerged in China, the country's airlines were among the first to ground flights. Airlines around the world stopped buying new planes, and Airbus and Boeing reduced production. But an end to lockdowns in much of the world has triggered soaring demand for travel again -- and for new jets from airlines.</p><p>Air travel in China, however, has lagged behind. After a quick resumption of domestic flying, demand has fallen back again as the country has struggled with outbreaks of Covid-19.</p><p>Boeing, meanwhile, has trailed Airbus in boosting production. It has been hit by a nearly two-year grounding of its most popular jet, the 737 MAX, which the company re-engineered following two deadly crashes. The company has also suffered production problems with other models.</p><p>The 737 MAX has returned to service in most of the world. China has signed off on the jet's fixes, but Chinese carriers haven't started flying it commercially again.</p><p>The deal marks the first for Airbus from a Chinese passenger airline since July 2019, according to a spokesman. Boeing's last order from China for a passenger aircraft was in October 2017, according to Boeing's website. The two plane makers have a duopoly in the market for big passenger jets.</p><p>Long anticipating a return to air-travel demand, Airbus has been revving up production. In May, it said it would boost production of its A320 narrow-body family by 50% to 75 a month by 2025. The A320 competes against the 737 MAX. All of the jets ordered by China on Friday were A320s.</p><p>Still, the manufacturer has been battling with supplier bottlenecks, including delays to the delivery of engines. Airbus, which is currently building A320s at a rate of about 50 a month, delivered just 37 to customers in each of April and May. Airbus was making around 60 a month before the pandemic.</p><p>---</p><p>James T. Areddy contributed to this article.</p>",
