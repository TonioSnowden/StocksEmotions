  "title": "Business News:  Kittyhawk Air Taxis to Close Down  ----  By Allison Prang and Andrew Tangel",
  "text": "<p>   Kittyhawk, a startup backed by Google co-founder Larry Page that was working on developing air taxis, said it is winding down its business. </p><p>   \"We're still working on the details of what's next,\" the company said Wednesday in a two-sentence post on LinkedIn. </p><p>   The company didn't respond to a request to comment. </p><p>   Google didn't respond to a request to comment on behalf of Mr. Page, who sits on the board of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. </p><p>   Kittyhawk's closing marks an exit from a crowded industry. A large number of companies, both startups and legacy aviation firms, have been working on air taxis, or eVTOLs (short for electric vertical take off and landing). A handful have gone public. </p><p>   One issue is there aren't enough places for these vehicles to take off and land. Integrating them into existing air-traffic control systems has been a challenge. </p><p>   Kittyhawk, based in Palo Alto, Calif., was founded in 2010 by Sebastian Thrun. In 2019, Kittyhawk announced a strategic partnership with Boeing Co. </p><p>   A Boeing spokeswoman said Kittyhawk's decision to cease operations wouldn't affect its commitment to Wisk Aero, a joint venture to develop a flying taxi. She declined to specify how much of a stake Boeing has in the Wisk venture. </p><p>   \"We do not expect Kittyhawk's announcement to affect Wisk's operations or other activities in any way,\" she said. </p><p>   Wisk said it remains in a strong financial position, with both Boeing and Kittyhawk as investors. </p><p>   Boeing and Wisk earlier this week had detailed a plan to get automated and uncrewed aircraft to transport passengers and cargo around cities. </p><p>   In January, Boeing said it was investing $450 million in Wisk. </p><p>   At an aerospace event in Washington, D.C., last week, Boeing CEO David Calhoun said the plane maker looked forward to bringing Wisk's flying taxi to market. </p><p>   \"It will displace its alternative, which is a very loud and not emission-friendly alternative called a helicopter,\" Mr. Calhoun said. </p><p>   Others are also making moves in the market. United Airlines Holdings Inc. recently invested $15 million in a flying taxi company called Eve Air Mobility. The company is backed by Embraer SA, the Brazilian plane manufacturer. American Airlines Group Inc. last year said it planned to invest $25 million in Vertical Aerospace Group Ltd., a U.K.-based startup. </p><p>   The U.S. Air Force has also been involved with developing flying taxis for military use. </p><p>   Kittyhawk says on its LinkedIn page that the company has flown and made over 100 aircraft. </p><p></p>",
