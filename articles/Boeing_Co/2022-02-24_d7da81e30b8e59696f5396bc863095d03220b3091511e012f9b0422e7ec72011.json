  "text": "<p>Business leaders have warned Russia's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/07bbc5c7-e620-4734-83b5-7bb261363c35\">invasion</a> of Ukraine will heighten inflation and hit supply chains just as the global economy emerges from the disruption caused by the pandemic.</p> <p>“Market volatility will increase, energy prices will increase, which will fuel inflation,” Axa's chief executive Thomas Buberl told the Financial Times on Thursday. </p> <p>The conflict was a “symbol of how the world has changed”, and insurers needed to adapt to the new situation, he added.</p> <p>The deputy chief executive of Accor, Europe's largest hotel chain, said war could knock travel confidence again just as the sector recovers from the unprecedented impact of the pandemic.</p> <p>While stressing that the company has just over 60 hotels in Russia and Ukraine, Jean-Jacques Morin said: “The more difficult question is, what's the effect on destabilising the world by creating security risks and people being afraid? We don't know, we need to have time.”</p> <p>Accor said on Thursday that it returned to profitability in 2021 but revenue per available room, the industry's key metric, was 46 per cent down on 2019 levels. </p> <p>Morin, who is also chief financial officer at Accor, added: “When you had Covid [the markets] lost 20 per cent in one day. I don't think you have that reaction today,” he said. “It will be a very different story if the Americans send troops, if Europeans send troops.”</p> <p>Warren East, speaking after announcing he would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c2780aec-09ab-45e5-bcff-32a7e9ca6857\">step down</a> as chief executive of Rolls-Royce, warned that the unfolding conflict in Ukraine was producing “more uncertainty, which is fundamentally a bad thing”.&#xa0;</p> <p>The FTSE 100 aero-engine group had a “pretty small exposure” to Ukraine and Russia, with the latter making up less than 2 per cent of its total revenues, said East. </p> <p>Rolls-Royce, along with other aerospace companies including Airbus and Boeing, sources some of its titanium from Russia. East said the group bought about “20 per cent” of supplies from the country but stressed that it had been “prudently building stocks” over the past few months.</p> <p>Shares in Rolls-Royce were down 16 per cent by Thursday afternoon, while Accor and Axa were down 6 per cent, amid a broader sell-off.</p> <p>Axa, one of Europe's largest insurers, sold its Ukraine operations in 2018 and has a minority stake in Russian insurer, Reso Garantia, which Buberl said was not material to group performance. The group said it had less than €200mn in insurance exposure to Russia.</p> <p>“An insurer looks at things in the long term,” said Buberl, speaking after the publication of its full-year results, which showed a bounceback from Covid-related losses.</p> <p>“I still believe that the Russian market remains an interesting one and so we are committed, with our joint venture partners there, to continue and even go through that difficult phase.”</p> <p>Buberl said he expected western companies exposed to Russia and Ukraine to move quickly to realign disrupted supply chains, mirroring their experience during the pandemic. &#xa0;</p> <p>“It will be difficult for them to deal with, but it's often a matter of weeks and months until these companies adapt.”</p><p>Source: Ian Smith, Ian Johnston and Sylvia Pfeifer in London, Sarah White in Paris 2022 'Business leaders warn Ukraine invasion will fuel inflation and trigger disruption' FT.com 24 February.
