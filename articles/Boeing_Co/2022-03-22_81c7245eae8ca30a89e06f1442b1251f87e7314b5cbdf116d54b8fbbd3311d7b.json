  "text": "<p>We don't know yet why China Eastern flight 5735 crashed, and it could be some time before we doâ€”crash investigations often take months or years. Investigators usually try to find and analyze the plane's flight-data recorder and cockpit voice recorder to help gain insights into a flight's final moments. They are likely to also examine the debris from the crash and videos of its nosedive and look for any possible clues in the plane's maintenance record, among other pieces of evidence.</p><p>The plane wreckage was strewn across a forested mountainous area in southern China's Guangxi region, according to rescuers, which has complicated efforts to find the voice recorder, otherwise known as a black box.</p><p>It is rare for planes to crash once they have reached their cruising altitude, as this flight had, aviation-safety experts say.</p><p>\"Once they're at cruising altitude, generally aircraft don't crash. Most accidents occur on the landing and take-off phase of flight,\" said Paul Hayes, director of air safety and insurance at aviation consultancy Ascend by Cirium.</p><p>Aviation-safety consultant John Cox said there isn't yet enough evidence to start eliminating any possible causes.</p><p>\"Everything is on the table right now. The descent profile is very unusual,\" he said.</p><p>China's aviation regulator will lead the investigation, and the National Transportation Safety Board has appointed a senior air-safety investigator as a U.S. representative, the NTSB said. Representatives from Boeing, engine maker CFM International (a joint venture between General Electric Co. and France's Safran SA) and the Federal Aviation Administration will serve as technical advisers. That is typical in the event a Boeing plane crashes outside the U.S.</p><p>The FAA said it is ready to assist in investigation efforts if asked.</p><p>A senior official with China Eastern told reporters at a press briefing the day after the crash that the plane was in good working order and the crew was both qualified and in good health at the time of departure.</p><p>What do we know about the people aboard?</p><p>The plane was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said. Rescue teams began combing through the wreckage the day after the crash and said they have found no survivors. If everyone onboard is confirmed dead, it would mark China's deadliest crash in nearly three decades.</p><p>Sun Shiying, chairman of China Eastern's subsidiary branch based in southwestern China's Yunnan province, said the nine crew members on the flight were in good health and that their experience levels met official requirements.</p><p>Preliminary findings showed no foreign nationals were on the plane, said Wang Wenbin, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman. Passengers on the flight included the chief financial officer of Dinglong Culture Co., a, a Shenzhen-listed company based in Guangzhou whose businesses include titanium-ore mining and entertainment, as well as two people who worked for Zhongxinghua Certified Public Accountants LLP, a Beijing-based accounting firm with offices across the country.</p><p>What kind of plane was it?</p><p>The plane was a Boeing Co. 737-800. That is an older-generation model than the Boeing 737 MAX, which was grounded in 2019 after two fatal crashes. The MAX hasn't resumed commercial flying in China.</p><p>The 737-800 is one of the workhorses of the commercial aviation industry, with roughly 4,200 in service world-wide. It is the most popular of the 737 NG family of jets, which has one of the best safety records in commercial aviation. For the 737 NG family, fatal accidents in which the aircraft is damaged beyond repair have been relatively rare, with 0.09 such events per million departures over the course of almost 25 years in operation, according to a safety study of aircraft accidents through 2020 published by Boeing in September.</p><p>The plane involved in the crash Monday was relatively new. It first flew in June 2015.</p><p>China Eastern grounded the rest of its 737-800 fleet after the crash. Other airlines around the world continue to fly the jet.</p><p>What was the plane's itinerary?</p><p>The flight crashed about an hour and seven minutes into its journey from the southwestern city of Kunming to the southern metropolis of Guangzhou.</p><p>After climbing to an altitude of 29,100 feet, the jet cruised for 12 minutes at a speed of roughly 455 knots, or 524 miles an hour, according to Flightradar24 data. At 2:20 p.m. local time, its nose suddenly angled toward the ground.</p><p>The jet then plummeted from the sky, reaching vertical speeds of 31,000 feet a minute. It plunged more than 20,000 feet, to an altitude of 7,425 feet, then managed to gain about 1,200 feet in altitude before again nose diving toward the mountain, the data shows. The aircraft stopped transmitting at 3,225 feet, less than two minutes after entering the dive.</p><p>A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Administration of China told reporters at a news briefing Tuesday evening that air-traffic controllers tried several times to hail the jet after they saw its altitude drop sharply, but didn't get a response.</p><p>What is China's air-safety record?</p><p>China sharply improved its air-safety record after a series of fatal airplane crashes in the 1990s. In 1994, a Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154M operated by China Northwest Airlines, which has since merged with China Eastern, crashed on its way from the city of Xi'an to Guangzhou, killing all 160 people aboard.</p><p>The most recent fatal crash of a Chinese passenger airline happened in August 2010, when a jetliner made by Brazil's Embraer SA and operated by Henan Airlines crashed while landing on the runway, killing 42 of the 96 people aboard.</p><p>China Eastern, based in Shanghai, had gone more than 17 years without a fatal accident before Monday.</p><p>Micah Maidenberg contributed to this article.</p><p>This article might be updated.</p><p>Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com</p><p>China Plane Crash: What to Know About the Boeing 737 Wreck Where Rescuers Found No Survivors</p>",
