  "title": "Boeing 737 Crashes  In Southern China  With 132 on Board  ----  By Yoko Kubota, Benjamin Katz and Wenxin Fan",
  "text": "<p>   BEIJING -- A Boeing Co. 737 carrying 132 people dropped from the sky and slammed into a mountain range in southern China. </p><p>   The relatively new aircraft, operated by China Eastern Airlines, was at cruising altitude on Monday when it suddenly went into a nosedive, and plummeted more than 25,000 feet in less than two minutes, according to aircraft tracking service Flightradar24. </p><p>   Video footage circulated by Chinese state media showed a plume of gray smoke emerging from the crash site and what appeared to be a wing fragment lying along the side of a mountain trail with the Chinese characters for \"China Eastern\" partly visible. </p><p>   On board were nine crew members and 123 passengers, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said. If all are confirmed dead, it would mark China's deadliest aircraft crash in nearly three decades. </p><p>   The plane, a 737-800, which first flew in 2015, wasn't a 737 MAX, which has been under scrutiny since two separate crashes led to its grounding world-wide in early 2019 for nearly two years. </p><p>   About 50 minutes after departing the city of Kunming in the southwest of China, Flight 5735 had reached an altitude of 29,100 feet and was at a cruising speed of around 455 knots, or 524 miles an hour, with no signs of distress, according to Flightradar24 tracking data. </p><p>   About 12 minutes later, at 2:20 p.m. local time, and about the time when the flight would typically have begun its descent to Guangzhou, the aircraft's nose angled downward and the plane began hurtling toward the mountain side. </p><p>   The jet then plummeted from the sky reaching vertical speeds of 31,000 feet a minute, or more than 350 miles an hour. It initially fell to an altitude of 7,425 feet when it briefly managed to gain about 1,200 feet in altitude before again diving toward the mountain, the data show. The aircraft stopped transmitting at 3,225 feet, less than two minutes after entering the dive. </p><p>   \"Once they're at cruising altitude, generally aircraft don't crash,\" said Paul Hayes, director of air safety and insurance at aviation consulting firm Ascend by Cirium. \"Most accidents occur on the landing and takeoff phase of flight.\" </p><p>   Employees at Wuzhou City Beichen Mining Co., which mines ceramic clay in Guangxi's Teng County, where the crash was reported, heard the sound of an explosion on Monday afternoon and rushed to check the mine's surveillance footage, according to manager Liao Wenhui. </p><p>   The footage, which later spread on Chinese social media, showed a large object plunging vertically into the nearby mountains. </p><p>   \"It was only after the news broke that they realized what the camera had captured could be an image of the plane,\" Mr. Liao said. </p><p>   The 737 NG family of jets, of which the 737-800 is the most popular, has one of the best safety records in commercial aviation. </p><p>   The rate of fatal accidents in which the aircraft is damaged beyond repair is at a low 0.09 per million departures after almost 25 years in service, according to a study of aircraft incidents through 2020 published by Boeing last year. </p><p>   The newer 737 MAX, by comparison, had such accidents at a rate of 7.12 per million flights, with two tragic crashes occurring soon after the aircraft entered service. </p><p>   Monday's crash comes as Boeing is nearing the MAX's return to service in China after a three-year grounding there. </p><p>   China's safety regulator, the CAAC, recertified the aircraft in December last year -- more than a year after the Federal Aviation Administration approved the fixes and one of the last jurisdictions to do so -- but Chinese carriers are still due to bring the plane back into service. </p><p>   The CAAC will lead the investigation into Monday's crash, and the National Transportation Safety Board has appointed a senior air-safety investigator as a U.S. representative, the NTSB said. Representatives from Boeing, engine maker CFM International and the FAA will serve as technical advisers. That is typical in the event a Boeing plane crashes outside the U.S. </p><p>    Boeing shares traded down 3.6% after the crash. </p><p>    A Boeing spokesman said Monday it was working with the airline and is in contact with the NTSB, with its experts prepared to assist with the investigation. </p><p>   \"Our thoughts are with the passengers and crew,\" the company said. </p><p>   China Eastern responded to the crash by grounding the rest of its 737-800 fleet, China's state broadcaster China Central Television reported. </p><p>   As of 2019, the most recent year for which the company provides data, the carrier owned or leased 233 Boeing 737-800s -- accounting for more than a third of its narrow-body fleet. </p><p>   \"The company sends deep condolences to the passengers and crew members lost in the crash,\" it said, without specifying the death toll. </p><p>   President Xi Jinping of China said he was shocked by the accident and ordered a search-and-rescue mission, CCTV reported. Relatives of some of the passengers had arrived at Guangzhou's Baiyun airport, where they were awaiting news, while the People's Liberation Army was helping in the rescue efforts, according to state media. </p><p>   China Eastern, based in Shanghai, had gone more than 17 years without a fatal accident before Monday. A member of the SkyTeam alliance that also includes Delta Air Lines Inc., it carries 130 million passengers a year and has a 6 out of 7 rating on airlineratings.com. </p><p>   China has worked to dramatically improve its air-safety record after a series of fatal airplane crashes in the 1990s, when its airlines battled with persistent pilot errors, unreliable maintenance and inconsistent government oversight. The country has since recovered its credentials, with the CAAC insisting airlines addressed safety before embarking on a rapid expansion in the last two decades. </p><p>   In the most recent fatal crash of a Chinese passenger airline in August 2010, a jetliner made by Brazil's Embraer SA and operated by Henan Airlines crashed while landing on the runway, killing 42 of the 96 people on board. </p><p></p>",
