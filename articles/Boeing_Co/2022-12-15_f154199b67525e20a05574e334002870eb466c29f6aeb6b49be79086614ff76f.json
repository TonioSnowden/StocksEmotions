  "title": "Flights to Europe for Less Than $500? 5 Under-the-Radar, Temptingly Affordable Airlines; These small, little-known airlines offer tantalizing airfares across the Atlantic aboard brand new planes. So what's the hitch?",
  "text": "<p>TOYING WITH THE idea of a European vacation next year but haven't booked your trip? Experts, forecasting a travel boom across the pond in 2023, say affordable fares could become increasingly scarce. The latest crop of niche carriers, however, are luring budget-minded travelers with markedly lower fares. Mike Arnot, a spokesman for aviation analytics firm Cirium, said shoppers could reap savings of around 25% by booking on these under-the-radar carriers. Unsurprisingly, some of these upstarts follow the discounters' code of no-frills service and high fees for extras like a meal or checked bag. They may also operate less-than-daily service, which might lead to infuriatingly long delays if there's a cancellation. A word to the wise for prospective fliers: Book early and buy trip insurance to protect against airline snafus. Here, a closer look at some of the less familiar names jetting across the Atlantic:</p><p>Play</p><p>This Icelandic airline began trans-Atlantic flights to Reykjavik this year with a fleet of narrowbody Airbus jets from a trio of East Coast gateways: Baltimore/Washington International, Boston Logan and New York's Stewart Airport, in Newburgh. Next up: Washington Dulles, launching next spring with Play's trademark low fares beginning at $199 one-way. From Iceland, Play offers connecting flights to Paris, Berlin, Prague, Barcelona and other European cities.</p><p>Norse Atlantic Airways</p><p>The latest airline upstart from Norway, Norse Atlantic launched last summer with cheap flights from New York to Oslo, London and Berlin aboard Boeing 787 Dreamliners. The airline offers a range of fare classes, from \"Light\" (similar to basic economy) at fares starting at $135 one-way to \"Plus\" with free checked bags, meals and more flexibility on ticket changes, and a roomier premium class with recliner seats. The other U.S. cities on the airline's route map include Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles and Orlando. Flights from New York to Paris are expected to start in March.</p><p>Condor Airlines</p><p>The Condor brand started out as a German charter line decades ago, but it's still relatively unknown among U.S. travelers. After a reorganization following the collapse of its parent company, Thomas Cook airlines, Condor offers scheduled service year-round between Germany and New York, Los Angeles and Seattle. It also operates seasonal flights to other U.S. cities including Boston, San Francisco and Minneapolis. Prices start at $250 one-way economy; there's also a premium section. Starting next month, the airline plans to roll out a fleet of new widebody Airbus A330neos, painted in distinctive green-and-white-striped livery.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>What has been your experience flying with a small, relatively unknown airline? Join the conversation below.</p><p>French Bee</p><p>This Gallic upstart, which launched six years ago as \"French Blue,\" raised its trans-Atlantic profile last year. It now flies from Newark, L.A. and San Francisco to Paris Orly, with Miami flights slated to begin Dec. 15. French Bee also flies from San Francisco to Tahiti. Flights are via Airbus A350 widebody jets. Economy fares range from as low as $227 one-way from New York to Paris in March, to $453 one-way in June and July. In line with other low-cost airlines, amenities like a checked bag and a meal cost extra.</p><p>Neos Air</p><p>Another budget contender, Neos has been around for a while, operating a network of flights to tourist destinations around the world from its base in Italy. It recently expanded to the U.S. with three flights a week between New York's JFK Airport and Milan, via 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Fares start at $218 one-way.</p><p>Flights to Europe for Less Than $500? 5 Under-the-Radar, Temptingly Affordable Airlines</p>",
