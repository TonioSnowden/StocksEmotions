  "text": "<p>Airbus chief executive Guillaume Faury said he was “cautiously optimistic” about a recovery in aircraft demand this year despite a new wave of national lockdowns that are forcing airlines to slash flight schedules.&#xa0;</p> <p>Speaking on Friday, as Airbus revealed a 34 per cent decline in aircraft deliveries in 2020 to 566, Mr Faury said the group still hoped to increase production of single-aisle aircraft in the second half of the year. Last year Airbus slashed production by close to 40 per cent and announced 15,000 job cuts.&#xa0;</p> <p>The better than expected result on deliveries cements Airbus's lead over Boeing as the world's largest aircraft maker for the second successive year, largely thanks to its popular A320neo family of single-aisle aircraft. Of the 566 aircraft delivered, 446 were single aisled. </p> <p>Mr Faury said: “We believe there will be a ramp up, first in 2021, and in 2022 and 2023 there will be a ramp up again.” He acknowledged that 2021 still posed “a high level of instability and volatility”, however. </p> <p>The Financial Times reported last autumn that suppliers had been asked to be ready <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c98a9ec6-8e10-40b6-a04d-137ee441bf75\">to increase production to 47 single-aisle aircraft a month</a> from July, should certain conditions be met. </p> <p>But some suppliers now expect any increase to be implemented later in the year, given the increasingly gloomy outlook for air travel. Many also expect any increase to be more modest, said one supplier. “Things are smouldering but for the moment there is nothing announced,” said one.</p> <p>Mr Faury said he could not promise that the group would be able to deliver more aircraft this year than last. An update would be given at the annual results in February, he said.</p> <p>Investors and analysts watch delivery targets closely as a signal on expectations for cash flow, with substantial payments made on aircraft handovers.&#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Airbus said it had logged 268 orders net of cancellations. Orders from AirAsia, the troubled Malaysian budget long-haul airline, were among the 115 cancellations and the backlog stood at 7,184 aircraft.</p> <p>Christian Scherer, Airbus chief commercial officer, said he expected new orders to remain subdued until passenger traffic was “back to some degree of normalcy”. That was unlikely for “some time”, he added.</p> <p>Arch-rival Boeing has struggled not only with Covid, but also with the work to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e64a9ea-4659-4513-b82f-0a4b5e7cae1c\">recertify its 737 Max single-aisle for commercial flight after two fatal accidents</a>. The US aircraft maker, which received the green light from regulators at the end of last year to return the 737 Max to service, is expected to post its 2020 orders and deliveries later this month.</p><p>Source: Peggy Hollinger, international business editor 2021 'Airbus optimistic on recovery in aircraft demand despite virus surge' FT.com 8 January.
