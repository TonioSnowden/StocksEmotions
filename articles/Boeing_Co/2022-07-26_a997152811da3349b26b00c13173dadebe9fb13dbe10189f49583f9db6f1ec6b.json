  "title": "GE Gets Lift From Aviation but Cuts Cash-Flow Goals; Conglomerate says inflation, supply-chain delays continue to affect business",
  "text": "<p>Executives said about two-thirds of the lower cash flow projection reflects orders pushed into future quarters, including because supply problems prevented GE from making deliveries.</p><p>Chief Executive Larry Culp said the company expected \"significant year-over-year improvement\" in profit and cash flow in 2023, but held off on more specific updates to the company's forecast. \"With so much in flux right now around the world, I think it's important for us to see how the next six months unfold,\" he said on a conference call.</p><p>The Boston-based conglomerate is in the process of splitting into three companies, starting with a planned spinoff of its healthcare business in early 2023. GE projected what it described as a slight decline in the full-year profit outlook for its healthcare division, citing inflation as the primary driver.</p><p>Revenue in the company's aviation business surged 27% to $6.13 billion, making it the biggest and most profitable division, driven by demand for services and spare parts sales even as supply-chain problems reduced engine deliveries. The unit produces and repairs engines for Boeing Co. and Airbus SE; and GE said it expects demand to remain strong as travel rebounds after the pandemic.</p><p>Overall, GE reported a second-quarter loss to common shareholders of $857 million, improved from $1.19 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding items, GE said its adjusted earnings were 78 cents a share, compared with Wall Street's estimate of 42 cents a share.</p><p>Revenue was $18.64 billion versus $18.25 billion a year ago. Analysts had projected $17.9 billion, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>In the second quarter, GE reported free cash flow of $162 million, down from $199 million a year ago. Executives had warned in April that quarterly cash flow could be negative again after GE had negative cash flow of $880 million in the first quarter.</p><p>Supply-chain problems, the Covid-19-related impact of plant shutdowns in China and fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine together reduced an adjusted measure of revenue by about 5 percentage points year to date, including about 1 point from the Russia-Ukraine war alone, the company said.</p><p>Lower orders for onshore wind turbines and inflation in its renewable-energy business reduced profit margins there, and the company said those and other pressures mean the unit no longer expects a \"step-up in profit\" in the second half of the year.</p><p>Demand declined in large part because of changes in the availability of U.S. tax credits for wind generation, GE said. The unit contributed about a third of the projected cash-flow decline.</p><p>\"Given the U.S. political environment, we're taking a more conservative view of the market for the time being,\" Mr. Culp told investors. \"This is still a business we have confidence in, even though we may have a lull in demand in the short term.\"</p><p>The company otherwise reiterated an April warning that 2022 adjusted earnings are likely to come in at the low end of its January forecasts of $2.80 to $3.50 a share. The company has previously said that rising costs would likely outstrip its ability to raise prices, but that the gap would start to shrink in the second half.</p><p>The company said it had raised prices in all its segments during the second quarter, and expects that to continue the rest of this year. Its own costs are also likely to remain under pressure, the company said.</p><p>Write to Theo Francis at theo.francis@wsj.com</p><p>GE Gets Lift From Aviation but Cuts Cash-Flow Goals</p>",
