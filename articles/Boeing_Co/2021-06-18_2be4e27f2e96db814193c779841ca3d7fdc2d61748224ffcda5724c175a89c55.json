  "text": "<p>In a scrappy lean-to on a former farm at London's eastern fringe, we drank a mug of instant coffee, ate a biscuit, then set off to experience the future of aviation.</p> <p>Those who don't follow the industry closely would be forgiven for thinking its Holy Grail — fully electric, zero-carbon flight — was still a vague ambition, years from being realised. In fact, it was waiting for me on the far side of the rusting metal hangar at Damyns Hall Aerodrome, a couple of miles from the final stop on the District tube line.</p> <p>There, new and gleaming white in the early morning sun, was the world's first fully certified electric aircraft, a two-seater Pipistrel Velis Electro. The EU Aviation Safety Agency awarded it “type certification” in June last year — meaning it can be used in commercial operations and carry passengers. </p> <p>That achievement was arguably a milestone to rank alongside the first certification of a piston-engined plane (1927) and of a jet-powered passenger plane (1952), and yet it was all but overlooked by the mainstream press. Perhaps that was because the world was preoccupied with the pandemic, perhaps because the milestone was achieved not by Airbus or Boeing but a small Slovenian manufacturer founded in 1989.</p> <p>Wearing aviator shades and sandals, Deepak Mahajan, an instructor at Damyns Hall and head of flight operations for NEBO Air, a start-up all-electric “micro-airline”, showed me how to get in, gingerly sitting on the edge of the lightweight composite cockpit and swinging my legs inside. This plane was the first Velis Electro in the UK, delivered last month and with 10 hours of flying time on the clock, but 39 have already been sent to customers worldwide, mainly to flight training schools or private pilots eager to own a “Tesla of the skies”.</p> <p>Anyone who has flown in a light aircraft will be used to waiting while the pilot performs an exhaustive pre-flight checklist — testing oil pressure, checking fuel tanks, revving the engine — but there was none of that. Instead, Mahajan flicked a few switches, we waited perhaps 30 seconds while the plane's computers carried out a self-check, then we were ready to go. “I'm still learning how to fly it,” he chuckled as we taxied across the grass.</p> <p>With neither the vibration of a piston engine nor the roar of a jet — rather a polite whirr — the plane shot forward, and within 250 metres we were airborne. We climbed above the rush-hour traffic on the Dartford bridge, passed low over a glittering Thames, banked over the filling car parks of the Lakeside Shopping Centre. Perhaps it was the good weather and early hour, but the flight felt far smoother than you might expect in such a small plane.</p> <p>One of the many screens showed how much power we were using — as little as 8kW at some points (equivalent to about four domestic kettles) — while a bigger display showed the power left in the two batteries. Owners of electric cars will be used to “range anxiety”; in the air, it takes on a rather greater significance.</p> <p>Aside from avoiding carbon emissions, the advantages of electric flying are numerous. Without all the heat generated by a conventional engine, stored power is converted to motion far more efficiently, making flying much cheaper (for our 30-minute flight the fuel bill was about £1). Without the vibrations, the aircraft requires less maintenance, and with fewer moving parts, it is simpler to carry out.</p> <p>Batteries, though, are the big sticking point, currently lacking the “energy density” — more simply, being too heavy — to allow for long flights or carrying large numbers of passengers. The Velis's two liquid-cooled batteries (one behind the seats, the other behind the propeller) give it a flying time of about an hour. Luggage capacity is pretty much zero. </p> <p>NEBO Air, founded by Russian-born lawyer and pilot Sergey Grachev, plans to use it for public demonstration flights at Damyns Hall, starting this month, for pilot training and later as a way of transporting individual passengers between London, Shipmeadow (a private airfield on Grachev's Suffolk hobby farm) and Wickenby Aerodrome in Lincolnshire. That route map is an esoteric proposition for an “airline”, especially given that, as it takes an hour to recharge a battery, it would probably be quicker to drive.</p> <p>In fact, a key part of NEBO Air's plan is simply to attract eco-conscious customers to Grachev's 40-acre farm. There, guests will be able to take electric flights before enjoying yoga, farm tours and walks with alpacas, while staying in a range of kooky, solar-powered accommodation, including a yurt, treehouse and railway carriage. “It's an incredible place, the goats come out to meet you when you land,” says Grachev.</p> <p>All that might make electric flying seem a narrow and slightly nerdy niche, fun for a few virtue-signalling early adopters but of little relevance to general travel until the big players get on board. But this is a ground-up revolution.</p> <p>“Everybody starts small but it's enough to provide an example,” says Grachev. “NEBO is an exercise to show pilots, airfields, engineers and the authorities that electric flying is here and we need to get ready for it.” In the absence of a government programme, he is applying for regional grants to put chargers (which cost about £15,000 each) at intermediate airfields along the way, then hopes to spread routes outwards like a growing spider's web.</p> <p>Pipistrel is now making about five Velis Electros per month; more than 200 pilots and 27 mechanics have been trained and this month the Danish military said it would start using the plane. And Ivo Boscarol, Pipistrel's founder, is confident the pace of progress will accelerate. “We proved to the aviation community that the first step, the most important step — the type certification — was possible,” he says. “This has been done and now the door is open to bigger electric aircraft, to longer range, to the development of really emission-free aviation.”</p> <p>One important detail is that the Velis's engine and battery are certified independently of the plane itself, meaning other manufacturers can use them in their own designs, shortcutting development time. Boscarol estimates 10 to 15 aircraft will have been produced using the Velis's propulsion system in the next five years, with at least two achieving type certification. Even those projects are a tiny proportion of the total: more than 200 electrically propelled aircraft are in development. “Now everything will happen much faster and the battery industry will understand that there is a market for cells with a different chemistry,” says Boscarol.</p> <p>Batteries are improving. Since December 2019, Vancouver-based seaplane airline Harbour Air has been carrying out regular test flights with a de Havilland Beaver retrofitted with an electric motor. It hopes a new battery system will allow it to gain certification and start commercial flights by next year, carrying four passengers on up to 30-minute trips. Meanwhile, Israel-based Eviation's new Alice aircraft, designed to carry nine passengers for 800km, is due to have its first flight this year. Others are working on hybrids — VoltAero's Cassio will make its public debut at the France Air Expo in Lyon this weekend.</p> <p>However, most expect the big advance to come from swapping batteries for hydrogen — an onboard fuel cell can create electricity to run a motor, with water the only emission. This too is already a reality, if not a certified commercial one: in September last year the ZeroAvia project made the first test flight of a fully hydrogen-powered passenger plane, using a converted six-seater Piper M-class at Cranfield in England. Pipistrel is also developing a new hydrogen-powered plane, the Miniliner, that will carry 19 passengers up to 400km. Boscarol hopes it will be flying by 2028, and certified by 2030.</p> <p>Crucial is that, in part thanks to its lightweight construction and multiple engines, it is designed to fly from small grass airfields used by recreational pilots. That vision, shared by developers of several other short-take-off electric planes and air taxis, means places such as Damyns Hall, and even Shipmeadow with its goats and llamas, are perhaps exactly the right place for electric flying to begin. Small enough to be close to towns and cities, they are numerous enough to make zero-emission flights direct to the places people want to travel.</p> <p>Electric aviation isn't about to replace longhaul jets but it might just be pioneering a new, more local and small-scale paradigm. “Right now, aviation is not organised in a very smart way because the passengers are forced to go to the airport,” says Boscarol. “We must change this: we must bring the airport to the passenger.”</p> <p>Many small airfields in Europe are under threat of being sold and built on, but the quietness of electric flying might provide a lifeline — removing the noise objections that have often restricted their operations. On my test flight we made several low passes over the airfield for photographs, then circled above a golf course and a lake where people were fishing. Neither golfers nor fishermen glanced upwards — they might have heard us, but we plainly weren't disturbing them. (Pipistrel say the Velis emits no more than 60dB, less than most washing machines.)</p> <p>We swooped back to land, coming softly to a halt on the grass and taxiing in past the airfield café. The families at the outdoor tables paid us little attention, focusing instead on two noisy and brightly coloured vintage planes undergoing pre-flight drills. For now, flying's electric revolution remains a quiet one in every sense — but perhaps not for much longer.</p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FTLifeArts\"><em>@FTLifeArts</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Tom Robbins 2021 'My electric flight into the future' FT.com 18 June.
