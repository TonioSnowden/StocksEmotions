  "text": "<p>Peggy Hollinger (“Superjumbos can still play a role in aviation's low-emission future”, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5aae5e6c-4d0f-4bc4-8318-8abb468d1878\">Inside Business</a>, July 29) posits that “superjumbo” aeroplanes could help the civil aviation industry curb the growth of its carbon emissions. </p> <p>However, the arguments she makes in support of this proposition misunderstand the extremely limited role “superjumbos” can possibly play in the commercial, passenger airline system. </p> <p>Further, she gives credence to technologies — electric and hydrogen powered aeroplanes — that are pre-embryonic with respect to commercial airline operations.</p> <p>The growth of direct city pair connections and flights at regional airports that she cites are overwhelmingly short or medium-range operations not suited to “superjumbos”. </p> <p>The oft-described “point-to-point” model of airline intercontinental service is in fact overwhelmingly a hub-to-spoke model. </p> <p>Hollinger argues that superjumbos may have a role to play in low-emission aviation but offers no assessment of the emissions savings of converting the existing system to one in which “superjumbos” would consolidate passenger traffic in a small network of hub airports to then be distributed by smaller aeroplanes, given existing technology. </p> <p>Instead, she relies on the prospects for new technologies that, at best, will be able to transport van-sized loads of passengers from hubs to their ultimate destinations and are anyway decades away from feasibility. Hub airports and the airspace around them are already congested. That is why the size of twin engined, long-haul aeroplanes and single-aisle short haul aeroplanes have been growing, reducing per-passenger emissions.</p> <p>It is inconceivable that the air traffic management system could accommodate the kind of transition Hollinger's sources appear to envision.</p> <p>The only current realistic way forward for the air transport industry to reduce the growth of carbon emissions is to transition to biofuels. There are several promising feed stocks that have passed proof-of-concept but scalability remains a significant challenge. </p> <p>Changes to incentive structures will be necessary to speed the transition. </p> <p><strong>John Griffiths <br></strong><em>Former Chief Economist<br>Boeing Commercial Airplanes <br>Seattle, WA, US</em></p><p>Source:  2021 'Letter: Aviation should look to biofuels, not superjumbos' FT.com 5 August.
