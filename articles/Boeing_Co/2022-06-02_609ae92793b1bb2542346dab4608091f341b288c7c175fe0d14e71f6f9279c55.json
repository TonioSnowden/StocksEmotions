  "title": "Former Head of Colombia's Cali Cartel Dies in U.S. Prison; Drug gang run by Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela, who died at age 83 of undisclosed causes, once sent about 80% of the cocaine that entered the U.S.",
  "text": "<p>As the head of the Cali cartel along with his brother Miguel, Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela built what former U.S. law-enforcement officials said was once the world's biggest cocaine-trafficking organization that at one point sent some 80% of the cocaine that entered the U.S. The two brothers made an alliance with Mexican drug traffickers that paved the way for Mexico's dominance of the drug trade today, according to U.S. law-enforcement officials.</p><p>\"It was the most sophisticated criminal organization in the history of the world,\" said Luis Moreno, a former U.S. ambassador who at the time was involved in a multiagency task force set up in Washington to bring down the cartel. \"They had people with masters' degrees from Harvard working for them.\"</p><p>Born into a poor family, Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela was raised in Cali, Colombia's third-biggest city that became a hotbed for drug trafficking where narcos lived semi-openly. Once a pharmacist, he rose from car thief and kidnapper to run a cartel that controlled much of the city. He also became a bitter rival of Pablo Escobar, the head of the Medellín cartel who had declared war on the Colombian state and his drug rivals.</p><p>Mr. Escobar, who had political ambitions and was an alternate delegate to Colombia's congress, allegedly downed a commercial aircraft and bombed Colombian malls, the country's second-largest newspaper and its version of the FBI. Four presidential candidates, dozens of judges, top police and government officials were killed by assassins working for him and his paramilitary allies.</p><p>Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela and his brother saw the sweeping bloodshed unleashed by Mr. Escobar as a threat to their own drug business, said Mike Vigil, the former chief of international operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.</p><p>\"They looked at him as an out-of-control animal that they needed to deal with because he was causing problems for everyone,\" said Mr. Vigil, who investigated both cartels while stationed in Colombia. \"They knew that they had to get rid of this guy.\"</p><p>As part of an organization called \"PEPES,\" or People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar, the Cali cartel began killing anyone associated with Mr. Escobar, Mr. Vigil said. That weakened the Medellín cartel, Mr. Vigil said, which resulted in Mr. Escobar being tracked down and shot dead in 1993 on the roof of a Medellín house by Colombian police.</p><p>\"Los PEPES had ties to Colombian security forces and were passing information to them,\" said Mr. Vigil. \"The U.S. knew that was taking place but looked the other way because of the great damage Escobar was inflicting on the country.\"</p><p>Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela and the Cali cartel generally bought off politicians rather than murdering them, former Colombian and U.S. law-enforcement officials said. In 1994, a tape was leaked shortly after Ernesto Samper, the candidate of the Liberal Party, had won the second round of the presidential election. In the tape, Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela's brother, who is now imprisoned in the U.S., discussed payment of $6 million into Mr. Samper's campaign coffers.</p><p>That material nearly brought down the Samper government. Mr. Samper had at the time and continues to deny receiving the money.</p><p>The Rodríguez Orejuela brothers were responsible for introducing the cultivation of coca leaves—the raw material for making cocaine—into Colombia, which they did to compete with Mr. Escobar's dominance of coca-paste supplies coming from Bolivia, said Baruch Vega, a former DEA and FBI informant who penetrated the Cali gang. Mr. Vega said the cartel put Colombian guerrillas on the payroll to grow the leaf, providing them with massive drug profits that fueled their war against the state.</p><p>\"That's when poor guerrillas became multimillionaire guerrillas,\" said Mr. Vega.</p><p>Under the leadership of Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela, members of the Cali cartel working in the U.S. and elsewhere tried to keep low profiles, said Mr. Moreno, the ambassador. \"They had guides as to how to fit in, what neighborhoods to live in and what kind of car to drive so you could fit in and not stand out,\" he said.</p><p>With Mr. Escobar's downfall, Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela and his brother continued to send tons of cocaine to the U.S. and Europe, U.S. prosecutors said. The cartel built a corporate-like entity that included specialized units for transporting cocaine, laundering money and carrying out assassinations, according to Mr. Vigil. On the side, Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela, who sought to portray himself as a businessman, owned pharmacies and a professional soccer club, said Mr. Vigil.</p><p>\"The Cali cartel acted like great entrepreneurs who had relations with the traditional political class,\" said Petrit Barquero, a historian and political scientist at the University of the Andes. \"The Cali cartel not only exported cocaine, it was an organization that dominated many fronts: the political, the social and the cultural. And Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela was its great chief.\"</p><p>On applications to work for the cartel, prospective employees had to disclose where their families lived in Colombia, with the understanding that if anything went wrong, their relatives were at risk, said Mr. Moreno.</p><p>Guillermo Pallomari, a Chilean-born computer systems analyst, kept the books for the Cali cartel for years. But Mr. Pallomari turned against the gang after it allegedly murdered his wife, according to court documents.</p><p>Mr. Pallomari spent five years working next to Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela's younger brother, who was \"virtually obsessed\" that no one would cheat him, according to an affidavit submitted by a U.S. customs agent to support the extradition of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, a Mexican drug lord who died after undergoing plastic surgery in 1997.</p><p>According to the affidavit, the younger Rodríguez Orejuela brother and Mr. Carrillo Fuentes were the architects of an alliance between the Cali cartel and Mr. Carrillo Fuentes' Juarez cartel—which later, along with other Mexican drug organizations, wrested control of the drug trade from the original Colombian traffickers.</p><p>That partnership was cemented after the Cali cartel abandoned its established Miami routes due to the arrest of a top cartel member in the Florida city in 1992, the affidavit said.</p><p>The Cali cartel and Mr. Carrillo Fuentes, known as the \"Lord of the Skies\" for flying huge plane loads of cocaine into the U.S., developed three routes for bringing in the drugs, including an air corridor that used stripped-down Boeing 727s to carry loads as large as 7.5 metric tons, the affidavit said.</p><p>At first, the cartel paid Mr. Carrillo Fuentes a \"transportation charge\" of one kilo of cocaine for every two kilos that entered the U.S. successfully. Eventually, Mr. Carrillo Fuentes became a top cocaine purchaser himself, according to the affidavit.</p><p>Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela's downfall came in 1995, when he and his brother were arrested in an high-end home in Cali. Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela was extradited to the U.S. nine years later, where prosecutors said he had trafficked about 200 tons of cocaine to the U.S. He pleaded guilty after making a deal that allowed other family members to avoid criminal investigations.</p><p>At the time of his death, investigators in Colombia were working to learn more from him about ties between the cartel and powerful political and business figures in Colombia. The Truth Commission, a special body set up as part of a peace process between Colombia's government and a guerrilla group that demobilized in 2017, had been planning to visit Mr. Rodríguez Orejuela in the U.S., a person familiar with the matter said.</p><p>\"We got nothing,\" said the person. \"He died before we could talk.\"</p><p>Juan Forero and Jenny Carolina Gonzalez contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to José de Córdoba at jose.decordoba@wsj.com and Ryan Dube at ryan.dube@dowjones.com</p><p>Former Head of Colombia's Cali Cartel Dies in U.S. Prison</p>",
