  "title": "Qantas Plans Nonstop Flights to Australia From New York, London; Airline orders dozens of planes from Airbus, including some to provide the long-haul service starting in late 2025",
  "text": "<p>Qantas currently flies nonstop from Australia's east coast to cities such as Los Angeles and Dallas, but New York is too far, and its service to London flies through Darwin, a city on Australia's northern coast. Qantas conducted research flights a few years ago to test how passengers fare on ultralong-haul routes, with one flight between New York and Sydney taking more than 19 hours.</p><p>\"The board's decision to approve what is the largest aircraft order in Australian aviation is a clear vote of confidence in the future of the Qantas Group,\" Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce said. The airline said the aircraft will also be able to operate nonstop flights to Australia from destinations such as Paris and Frankfurt.</p><p>Qantas didn't disclose the cost of the Airbus order, but said a significant discount from the standard price should be assumed.</p><p>Qantas said it is ordering 12 Airbus A350-1000s for its Project Sunrise flights. The airline said the cabin will be specially configured for improved comfort on long flights, including features such as a well-being zone in the center of the aircraft where digital displays will provide movement and stretching recommendations. First-class suites will have both a bed and a lounge chair.</p><p>In addition, the airline said it is ordering 40 A321XLRs and A220 aircraft for its domestic fleet, as well as 94 purchase-order options that will spread over at least a decade. Those planes will replace aging Boeing 737s and 717s, Qantas said.</p><p>Combined with an existing order for its budget airline Jetstar, Qantas said its total group order with Airbus now includes 299 planes, half of which are direct orders and half of which are purchase-right options.</p><p>Qantas also said Monday that domestic travel is returning to pre-Covid-19 levels ahead of expectations. It said there is strong demand for international travel but that some key markets aren't yet open.</p><p>Australia had largely closed its border to tourists for much of the pandemic and imposed restrictions on citizens and others as well. Those restrictions loosened earlier this year, leading the country's tourism department to start a new ad campaign.</p><p>Qantas's underlying earnings before interest, tax and other items, or Ebitda, is expected to be between 450 million Australian dollars, equivalent to US$318 million, and A$550 million in the second half of fiscal 2022, the airline said.</p><p>Shares of Qantas rose 2.9% Monday in Australian trading.</p><p>Write to Mike Cherney at mike.cherney@wsj.com</p><p>Qantas Plans Nonstop Flights to Australia From New York, London</p>",
