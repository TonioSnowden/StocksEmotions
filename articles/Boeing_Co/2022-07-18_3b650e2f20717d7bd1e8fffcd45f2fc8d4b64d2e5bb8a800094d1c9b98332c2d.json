  "text": "<p>Boeing chief executive Dave Calhoun has defended his record at America's largest aerospace company, insisting that he has sharpened its focus on engineering and that the indebted group could launch a new aircraft without having to raise money from shareholders.</p> <p>Calhoun said the company had made significant progress since he took the top job two-and-a-half years ago, when Boeing was reeling from the grounding of its 737 Max following two crashes. &#xa0;</p> <p>“We all have to put two-and-a-half years in perspective, and what we've done as a leadership team to get ahead of each and every one of our big issues and no they are not complete,” Calhoun said in an interview. </p> <p>But a series of production delays and challenges have brought Boeing's shares down 30 per cent this year compared with an 11 per cent decline in those of its arch rival Airbus. </p> <p>Deliveries of its wide-body 787 Dreamliner remain on hold following quality control issues while there are questions over the approval of its 737 Max 10 jet by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Stabilising the production of the 737 Max jet is another key challenge. </p> <p>Yet speaking to the Financial Times in London on the eve of the biennial Farnborough Air Show, the 65-year-old Calhoun struck a bullish tone about Boeing's prospects. </p> <p>Reflecting on his tenure since he took over in January 2020, Calhoun said “I'm actually feeling pretty good about the moment”. </p> <p>“The most difficult of our crises is being managed effectively. It's not done and that's the Max. But we're still returning aeroplanes to service for our customers.”</p> <p>Demand from airlines for new planes, he added, had rebounded strongly following a pandemic that plunged the aviation industry into its biggest crisis in decades. “We're in full recovery mode on demand,” he said.</p> <p>Calhoun was “comfortable” that regulatory approvals to allow the resumption of deliveries of the 787 would happen, but declined to offer a specific timeline. Regarding the 737 Max, the company was focused on ensuring it could reliably produce 31 planes a month. </p> <p>Delays in the delivery of the 737 Max have drawn direct criticism of Boeing's leadership from some of its biggest customers, including Michael O'Leary, the chief executive of low-cost carrier Ryanair.</p> <p>Calhoun said he took O'Leary's comments “very seriously, because if we deliver a new aeroplane even a day late, that affects his business”. He stressed, however, that his team was focused on a consistent production rate, adding: “My team is wrestling with this every day. I love them and I know we will get there.”</p> <p>Nevertheless, supply chain constraints continue to disrupt the industry. Stan Deal, who is head of commercial aeroplanes at Boeing, highlighted engine delays and shortages of semiconductors and other parts, as a key issue. &#xa0;&#xa0;</p> <p>Calhoun also sought to address concerns over the group's engineering culture, saying that he had shaken up the group's management structures and put people closer to the operational centres. </p> <p>One of his first acts when he took over was to ask Greg Hyslop, Boeing's chief engineer, to leave his Chicago office and move to Seattle, the company's main commercial aircraft manufacturing base. </p> <p>“My emphasis is distributed management, leadership close to the action,” said Calhoun.</p> <p>Hyslop told the FT that “I don't believe we've ever had a cultural issue around engineering at the Boeing Company. I do believe there were changes needed, [to] strengthen engineering, and provide more of a degree of independence for engineering”.</p> <p>One of the strategic conundrums facing Boeing is how to close the gap with Airbus, which has extended its lead in the lucrative market for single-aisle aircraft that serve short and medium-haul destinations. The European aerospace group, which has an almost 60 per cent market share, recently secured a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3692b278-f4d1-42f0-9ad9-c4b8039b2ac7\">$37bn order from Chinese state airlines</a>. </p> <p>“I'm in 40 per cent [of the market],” said Calhoun. “And if the marketplace saw me delivering stably at 40 per cent they would be head over heels ecstatic. I think I'll be better than 40 per cent if I can get back on an equal footing in China.”</p> <p>Analysts have said Boeing needs to launch a new plane to take on Airbus' best-selling A321neo, with some suggesting it will need to raise equity to do so given its $45bn of net debt. Calhoun played down that any launch was imminent, saying that advances in engine technology did not yet make it worthwhile. </p> <p>“The question about when you introduce a new commercial aeroplane . . . has to do with the technology readiness with respect to the propulsion packages . . . and whether they're going to create a big enough difference for the marketplace to then go out and place orders and I don't think we're at that threshold.”</p> <p>When the time is right Boeing could launch a new plane without raising new equity, according to Calhoun, as the company's engineers are already building the digital infrastructure to enable the next plane, which will reduce the development time. </p> <p>“It's important that those [technologies] be proven and available, the biggest one being the digital model, the digital twin for that development. And that is in full force,” he said.</p> <p>By the time Boeing needed to spend money, Calhoun added, the “cash flow numbers will be significantly different and in my view, more than that”.</p> <p>“I believe it will be the ability to run a digital twin on a new commercial aeroplane that will enable us to reduce development time, strengthen product and factory safety and improve financial outcomes,” he said. </p><p>Source: Sylvia Pfeifer in London 2022 'Boeing chief defends his record amid production delays' FT.com 18 July.
