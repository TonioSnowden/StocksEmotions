  "text": "<p>What's happening</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 21 points, or less than 0.1%, to 36,121.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 index SPX fell less than 0.1%, or 1 point, to 4,682.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP fell 0.3%, or 44 points, to 15,816.</p><p>On Friday, the major U.S. benchmarks each snapped a stretch of five straight weekly gains, though the retreat was modest, leaving the S&amp;P 500 just 0.4% away from a record close.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Stocks started out on a relatively bullish footing on Monday, with a report on New York state manufacturing activity boosting sentiment on Wall Street.</p><p>The New York Fed's Empire State manufacturing business conditions index rose 11.1 points to 30.9 in November,&#xa0;the regional Fed bank said Monday.&#xa0;Economists had expected a reading of 22, according to a survey by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p>The upbeat manufacturing report comes after the University of Michigan consumer-sentiment survey released Friday showed inflation data weighing on consumer attitudes, though it isn't clear that will translate into weaker spending. The Chicago Fed ‘s advance retail trade summary expects a 2.6% jump in retail sales excluding autos for October, far stronger than the 1% gain seen in an economist poll. The retail sales report is due Tuesday.“We see equities as a potential buffer against inflation because we expect a more muted response of yields to inflation than in the past,” according to Jean Boivin and others at the research arm of BlackRock Inc., the world's largest money manager.&#xa0;“Real, or inflation-adjusted, yields should remain low or negative as a result, making equities attractive. In addition, many companies so far have been able to pass on higher input costs and keep their margins intact.”</p><p>See:Why the hottest inflation in 3 decades isn't rattling stock-market bulls</p><p>Strong third-quarter earnings have been a pillar of this recent run-up in equities, with consumers central to the economic rebound from the debilitating COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>“Supply chain pressures are easing and should allow&#xa0;equities&#xa0;to continue to deliver strong revenue growth and record margins,” wrote analysts led by JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.'s Marko Kolanovic, chief global markets strategist. “Even for the cohort that faces meaningful disruptions, we expect these issues to largely abate” by the second half of 2022, “resulting in delayed revenues rather than demand destruction.”</p><p>The inflation backdrop makes the next choice of Federal Reserve chair all the more important politically for President Joe Biden. The Wall Street Journal reported that Biden is said to be deciding between reappointing Chairman Jerome Powell or choosing Fed Gov. Lael Brainard as early as this week. Biden interviewed both candidates earlier this month, and the meeting with Brainard was described by people familiar with the matter as going better than expected, the report said.</p><p>Biden is due to sign the infrastructure bill into law Monday afternoon. He's also due to hold a virtual meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the evening.</p><p>Meanwhile, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told the European Parliament that the central bank expects inflation to moderate next year, though prices will take longer to decline than originally expected. She also said that it was “very unlikely” conditions would be met by next year that would allow for an interest-rate hike.
