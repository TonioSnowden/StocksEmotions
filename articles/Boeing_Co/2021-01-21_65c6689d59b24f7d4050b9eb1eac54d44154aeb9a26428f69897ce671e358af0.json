  "text": "<p>I believe Boeing's board has tolerated these failures because the company is a $120 billion enterprise that can easily absorb those financial penalties. Corporate officers have mostly been untouched by their poor decisions. Should this be the manner in which Boeing functions in perpetuity with no consequences for its employees at the executive level?</p><p>Perhaps it is time Boeing's leadership stops obsessing over shareholder returns and focuses more attention on producing its products and services in a better and timely manner, and in that way not damage its future revenue and global reputation. Better yet would be that Boeing cleans house at the executive level and promotes engineering managers into those positions, lest it continue to be saddled by scandals, financial penalties and overall poor performance.</p><p>Kevin A.
