  "text": "<p>   The White House said President Biden will nominate Denver airport chief Phil Washington to lead the Federal Aviation Administration, picking an executive who has run large surface transport agencies to head the U.S. air-safety regulator. </p><p>   Mr. Washington, who currently serves as chief executive of Denver International Airport, played a leading role in Mr. Biden's transition team for the U.S. Transportation Department. An Army veteran who rose to the rank of command sergeant major, Mr. Washington previously led the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority for six years and headed a Denver-area transportation agency between 2009 and 2015. </p><p>   Mr. Washington didn't respond to requests to comment Wednesday. </p><p>   If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Washington would confront multiple challenges, including recent widespread air-traffic disruptions as airlines struggle to meet surging demand for flights, and improving the agency's oversight of aviation safety after two Boeing 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019. The FAA, under pressure from Congress, has been tightening its scrutiny of Boeing and other aerospace manufacturers following the MAX crashes, which took place in Indonesia and Ethiopia and claimed 346 lives. Those accidents tarnished the FAA's reputation as a global flight-safety regulator. </p><p>   Senate Commerce Chairwoman Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.) said Mr. Washington would receive careful consideration during his confirmation process. \"I expect and will require strong leadership from the next FAA administrator,\" she said. </p><p>   House Transportation Chairman Peter DeFazio (D., Ore.) said he supported Mr. Washington, calling him \"a proven leader with strong managerial skills who has what it takes to get things back on track and rebuild public trust.\" </p><p>   In addition to handling air-traffic control and oversight of plane makers, the FAA is responsible for regulating commercial space launches, setting rules for drone operations and licensing pilots, among other tasks. </p><p>   This year the agency has faced challenges with busy airline flight schedules, weather disruptions and, according to airlines, staffing challenges at some of the agency's air-traffic-control facilities. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said this week that the majority of cancellations and delays haven't been driven by air-traffic-control issues. </p><p>   Mr. Washington was confirmed in his current role at the Denver airport in July of last year, but the Chicago native has spent most of his career leading agencies that are focused on surface transportation, such as buses and passenger rail service. </p><p>   His experience in the Army is seen as helpful in leading large, complicated organizations such as the FAA, according to industry officials who know Mr. Washington. </p><p>   The FAA has been run by safety chief Billy Nolen, a former American Airlines Group Inc. pilot and executive focused on regulatory and safety matters, on an acting basis since the last permanent administrator, Steve Dickson, stepped down from the job at the end of March. </p><p></p>",
