  "title": "Boeing Reports Loss as 787 Charges Mount; Dreamliner weighs on plane maker's results as it compensates customers after prolonged halt in jet deliveries",
  "text": "<p>Airlines are continuing to recover from pandemic-driven travel restrictions that left global capacity down 27% last year from 2019 levels. Boeing delivered only half as many jetliners last year as rival Airbus SE but secured more orders and said it plans to boost production further in 2022.</p><p>Boeing on Wednesday reported a loss of $4.3 billion for 2021 after a $4.16 billion deficit in the final quarter, following a year when it slowly increased production of new jets but struggled to deliver them.</p><p>A series of factory defects and regulatory snags has largely prevented Boeing from handing over the popular wide-body Dreamliner to customers for more than a year.</p><p>The latest charge includes $3.5 billion to compensate customers for the delays, with unanticipated production costs now forecast to double to $2 billion over the next two years as Boeing slowed output.</p><p>Boeing said it stopped bleeding cash in the latest quarter for the first time since the first three months of 2019, when air-safety regulators world-wide grounded the 737 MAX after two fatal crashes. It said it expects to generate positive cash for all of 2022, helping the shares rise 2% in pre-open trade.</p><p>Chief Executive David Calhoun said in an internal memo the cash generation was \"another key step in our overall recovery,\" calling 2021 a \"rebuilding year for us.\"</p><p>The Chicago-based aerospace giant said it benefited from a broadening recovery in the commercial jet market. It has been helped by the boom in airfreight, with cargo traffic last year increasing about 7% above 2019 levels. Boeing said it expected passenger traffic to return to pre-pandemic levels as soon as next year or 2024.</p><p>Boeing reported a loss of $7.02 per share in the fourth quarter, compared with the consensus estimate for a 36-cent deficit among analysts polled by FactSet. Sales fell 3% to $14.8 billion.</p><p>The return to positive cash flow was driven by deliveries of the narrow-body 737 MAX jets, which began returning to service in late 2020.</p><p>Boeing also took another $402 million charge on its KC-46A tanker jet.</p><p>Deliveries of the Dreamliner aren't expected to resume until April at the earliest. The delays have prompted airlines to shuffle their fleet plans or in some cases reduce flight schedules. Boeing is awaiting regulatory approval for pre-delivery inspections.</p><p>\"While we never want to disappoint our customers or miss expectations, the work we're putting in now will build stability and predictability going forward,\" Mr. Calhoun said in his internal memo.</p><p>Boeing stopped short of issuing formal guidance but did forecast higher 737 and 787 deliveries in 2022 compared with last year, saying it expects to improve the stability of its operations.</p><p>The company said its performance would depend in part on U.S. trade relations with China. The country last year awarded key regulatory approvals for the 737 MAX to return to service following its grounding.</p><p>Boeing said its supply chain would be a watch item for future production rates. It said it would increase production this year of its wide-body 777 to three planes a month. It said it was on track to produce 31 of its 737 MAX jets a month early this year, up from 26 currently.</p><p>The company said it was producing Dreamliners at a \"very low rate until deliveries resume,\" gradually ramping up to minting five of the jets a month.</p><p>Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing Reports Loss as 787 Charges Mount</p>",
