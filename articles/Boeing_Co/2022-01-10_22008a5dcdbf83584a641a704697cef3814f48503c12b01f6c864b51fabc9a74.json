  "text": "<p>Airbus has retained its title over rival Boeing as the world's biggest aeroplane maker for the third year in a row after beating its goal to deliver 600 aircraft in 2021, even as it sounded a cautionary note about the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant. </p> <p>The European aerospace champion said it had delivered 611 revenue-generating aircraft last year, an increase of 8 per cent over 2020. More than two-thirds of its deliveries were for its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/88fa6193-2d78-459c-ac47-390f8b060823\">popular A320 family of single-aisle jets,</a> which are mostly used on short- and medium-haul flights where air travel has picked up quicker than long-haul.</p> <p>The company doubled its gross order intake, which excludes cancellations, over the past 12 months with 771 new sales. It secured 507 net orders. It ended the year with a backlog of 7,082 aircraft on order.</p> <p>The result underlined Airbus's <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24a4eec2-2af0-4c90-aa84-96f9019bd302\">lead over Boeing</a> in terms of deliveries. The US company, which is due to report its figures on Tuesday, had delivered 302 aircraft by the end of November. Boeing, however, looks set to win the race for orders, having secured 829 gross sales at the end of November.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/94e745e5-4c35-4ade-b550-1cca3e5f39cc\">Guillaume Faury</a>, Airbus chief executive, said the company's strong performance indicated that airlines were confident about the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3ac74918-7fee-4cb7-99cf-55207c9f10bf\">growth of air travel</a> after the Covid-19 pandemic. </p> <p>He cautioned, however, that Airbus and its suppliers were closely monitoring the spread of the Omicron variant, although it had not led to significant disruptions. Airbus has an assembly plant in Tianjin in northern China, which has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e0d01826-09d7-4597-ad46-75cd19403e1a\">tightened exit controls</a> to help block the spread of the highly transmissible variant. </p> <p>“Omicron has the potential to have a significant impact. For the moment we don't observe disruptions or risks that would impact us at a later stage,” said Faury.</p> <p>He added that Airbus was sticking to its plans to ramp up production of its A320 family of jets, with a target of 65 aircraft a month by the summer of 2023. Some suppliers and engine makers have raised concerns about the company's more aggressive suggestion for rates from 2025 onwards.</p> <p>Faury said the company was in a “quite complex situation with the supply chain”, citing challenges including the supply of raw materials, logistics and the availability of staff.</p> <p>“2022 will be an interesting year [but] we continue to believe we are on track to achieve our ramp-up plans,” he added. </p> <p>Sash Tusa, analyst at Agency Partners, said Airbus had “realistic, high enough orders to get to a rate of 65”.&#xa0;</p> <p>“The supply chain is fragile this year, but if they can get through the first quarter I&#xa0;think Airbus has customers to deliver 65 aircraft.”</p> <p>Robert Stallard, at Vertical Research Partners, said he expected continued <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21242e3b-298b-4a6f-a35f-32fdde905952\">strains on the supply chain in 2022</a> and beyond as both Airbus and Boeing “ramp up their narrow-body rates at a pace that is pretty rapid for the aerospace industry”.</p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/be562f75-7778-49b1-be5d-151b1597944f.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Sylvia Pfeifer in London 2022 'Airbus retains crown over Boeing as biggest jet maker for 3rd year in row' FT.com 10 January.
