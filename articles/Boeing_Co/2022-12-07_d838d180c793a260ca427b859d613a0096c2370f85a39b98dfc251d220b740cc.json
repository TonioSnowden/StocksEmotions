  "title": "Airbus to Miss Delivery Target",
  "text": "<p>Such a miss is rare in the commercial jet-making business, where annual deliveries offer bragging rights between Airbus and rival Boeing Co. but also go directly into cash flow. Much of a plane's cost is only paid for after delivery.</p><p>But the pandemic has played havoc on both Airbus's and Boeing's ability to gauge their once highly orchestrated supply lines. Meanwhile, Boeing's woes with its 737 MAX jet have hit its deliveries hard. That has all made the usual sprint between the two to rack up more deliveries than the other less of a contest this year.</p><p>Analysts estimate that Boeing, which hasn't outlined its own full-year delivery target, will hand over 471 aircraft this year, according to a consensus compiled by FactSet. The U.S. plane maker is set to outline its order and delivery figures for the year through November early next week.</p><p>Despite lower deliveries, Airbus still expects to meet its adjusted earnings goal of around 5.5 billion euros, or about $5.77 billion, and free cash flow of 4.5 billion euros in the full year.</p><p>Airbus and Boeing have been retooling their supply chains after both companies slashed production at the start of the pandemic. Airlines, which all but stopped flying for a period, are back in the air and ordering new jets. But they have struggled to get planes delivered on time from both manufacturers. They have also had problems getting spare engines and spare parts needed to keep flying the aircraft already in their fleets.</p><p>Steven Udvar-Hazy, executive chairman of Air Lease Corp., said at an industry conference last month that its orders for Airbus's biggest narrow body -- the A321neo -- were about six months or more behind schedule. \"Every plane last year and this year is delayed,\" he said.</p><p>Airbus Chief Executive Guillaume Faury told reporters last week that he didn't see any easing in delivery delays until at least the middle of next year. He said he expected it would take until the end of 2023 for the supply chain to catch up and start delivering on time. The energy crisis arising from the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and continuing shutdowns at some of its suppliers in China were among issues holding up production, Mr. Faury said.</p><p>It is just such a bottleneck Mr. Faury had hoped to avoid. He fought to keep his production lines ticking through the first year of the pandemic, in anticipation of a rapid bounceback in demand once travel restrictions were lifted and airlines returned to the sky.</p><p>That strategy has been paying off, with the company snatching up critical market share from its U.S. rival, especially in the key segment for single-aisle jets. Airbus says its availability is more or less sold out through 2028 for its flagship A320neo model.</p><p>The company downgraded its delivery guidance Tuesday after handing over 68 commercial aircraft to airline customers in November.</p><p>---</p><p>Doug Cameron contributed to this article.</p>",
