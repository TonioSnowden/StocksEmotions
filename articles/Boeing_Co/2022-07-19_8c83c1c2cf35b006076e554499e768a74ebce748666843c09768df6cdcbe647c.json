  "title": "Boeing Sells Five 787 Dreamliners to Aircraft Lessor in Air Show Boost; Deliveries of the wide-body jets have been on hold for much of the last two years",
  "text": "<p>Peter Anderson, AerCap's chief commercial officer, said jets like the Dreamliner used in international long-haul travel are in increasing demand as air travel recovers from the depths of the pandemic.</p><p>\"We see that market coming back strongly,\" he said while announcing the deal at the Farnborough International Air Show near London on Tuesday.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal first reported the deal earlier in the day.</p><p>Separately, Boeing on Tuesday said it struck a deal to sell 30 of its 737 MAX jets to a private-investment firm that will place the single-aisle jets with discount carriers. The deal comes with a commitment by the customer, 777 Partners, to buy up to 36 more.</p><p>Miami-based 777 Partners has placed aircraft with carriers such as Canadian discount carrier Flair Airlines Ltd.</p><p>The deal is for the 737 MAX 8 variant of the family. On Monday, Delta Air Lines Inc. said it would buy 100 737 MAX 10 jets, the longest and latest variety of the jet, with options to buy 30 more. Both orders represent a shot in the arm for the aircraft, which has been beset by a nearly two-year grounding after two deadly accidents.</p><p>Delta said Tuesday it would also buy 12 Airbus A220s, bringing its total for the former Bombardier aircraft to 107 aircraft. The U.S. carrier had 56 of the jets operating in its fleet as of the end of June.</p><p>Benjamin Katz contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing Sells Five 787 Dreamliners to Aircraft Lessor in Air Show Boost</p>",
