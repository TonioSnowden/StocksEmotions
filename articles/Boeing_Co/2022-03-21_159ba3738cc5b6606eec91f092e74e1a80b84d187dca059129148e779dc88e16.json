  "title": "Stocks End Lower After Powell Interest-Rate Comments; Oil prices advance, remain elevated at around $110 a barrel",
  "text": "<p>The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.4% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.6%. Boeing shares fell 3.6% after a Boeing 737 passenger plane operated by China Eastern Airlines carrying more than 130 people crashed in southern China.</p><p>Investors digested comments Monday from Mr. Powell as he discussed the economic outlook. Speaking at the National Association for Business Economics, he said the central bank was prepared to raise interest rates in half-percentage-point steps—and high enough to deliberately slow the economy—if needed.</p><p>\"Investors are taking Powell's transparency as a step further to say 'He's just preparing us for the worst,'\" said Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private. \"Whereas, bond market is saying, 'No, no, he's telling you he's going to do at least seven [rate increases], and you aren't listening.'\"</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.315% from 2.146% Friday, according to Tradeweb. Investors expect additional interest-rate increases from the Fed this year as the central bank aims to slow inflation that is running at its highest levels in four decades. Analysts say higher yields could sap appetite for riskier assets. Yields and prices move inversely.</p><p>\"I wouldn't say bonds look like a phenomenal investment at this point in time, but they are definitely more balanced than they were earlier into the year,\" said Matt Dmytryszyn, chief investment officer at Telemus.</p><p>The Ukraine war has heightened volatility in stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies as investors try to assess the economic impact of sanctions and the potential for disruptions to supply chains. Investors are monitoring developments out of the region and whether a resolution can be soon found.</p><p>\"This is the main driver of markets in the coming days and maybe even weeks—it is about everything that comes out of the Ukraine conflict,\" said Carsten Brzeski, ING Groep's global head of macro research.</p><p>In individual stocks, Shares of Nielsen Holdings dropped nearly 8% after it rejected a roughly $9 billion takeover offer from a private-equity consortium, saying that the offer undervalued the TV-ratings company. Shares of insurer Alleghany Corp. soared 25% after Berkshire Hathaway said it agreed to buy the company for about $11.6 billion in cash.</p><p>Brent-crude futures, the international benchmark, added $7.69 a barrel, or 7.1%, to $115.62. Their U.S. counterpart was up $7.42 per barrel, or 7.1%, to $112.12. Most of the S&amp;P 500's 11 sectors fell Monday. Energy, recently up 4%, was an exception. Occidental Petroleum rose 8.4%, Hess added 6.6% and Exxon Mobil gained 4.5%.</p><p>Elevated oil prices have prompted concerns of sustained high inflation and lower economic growth in the U.S. and Europe, as gas and energy prices eat away at household spending on other goods and services.</p><p>Support for a European Union-wide ban on the purchase of Russian oil is growing inside the bloc, according to diplomats involved in the discussions, which could send prices even higher. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has drawn focus on Europe's reliance on Russian energy, with Germany getting over half of its gas from Russia.</p><p>\"We have this growing awareness that a couple of supply chains could be broken for good. Energy prices, no matter how the war resolves, will remain high,\" Mr. Brzeski said.</p><p>The pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 traded up less than 0.1%. Russia's stock market remains closed, but trading of Russia's local-currency government bonds resumed Monday. Russia's central bank said it would purchase government bonds. Gov. Elvira Nabiullina said last week that the Moscow Exchange would reopen gradually but provided no details beyond the bond buying.</p><p>The Egyptian pound fell by more than 13% against the dollar Monday after Egypt's central bank raised its key interest rate at a meeting of policy makers that was brought forward by three days, citing the pickup in inflation pressures it sees following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>As with many countries in Africa, Egypt has relied heavily on Ukraine and Russia for its imports of wheat. According to the United Nations, more than 80% of its wheat imports came from the warring countries between 2018 and 2020.</p><p>Major indexes in Asia closed with mixed performance. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng declined 0.9%. China's Shanghai Composite edged up 0.1%. Markets in Japan were closed for a holiday.</p><p>—Anna Hirtenstein contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Hardika Singh at hardika.singh@wsj.com</p><p>Stocks End Lower After Powell Interest-Rate Comments</p>",
