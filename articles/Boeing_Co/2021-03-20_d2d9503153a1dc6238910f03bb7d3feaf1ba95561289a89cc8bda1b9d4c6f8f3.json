  "text": "<p>   In August 2020, Boeing provided an update to the FAA on its work to also strengthen 777 engine covers. The manufacturer told regulators it had decided to redesign and make replacement covers with which airlines could retrofit their fleets, according to the FAA document. </p><p>   Boeing's 777 engine-cover fix didn't come in time for the Dec. 4 incident near Japan, on a Japan Airlines Co. 777 with Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 engines. Two of an engine's fan blades broke, according to a preliminary report by Japanese investigators. Part of the engine's cover detached, and the jet's body and horizontal stabilizer sustained damage, the report said. A JAL spokesman declined to comment on the cause of the incident. </p><p>   The FAA held off ordering immediate action. After the December incident, the agency said it reviewed the JAL engine's maintenance and inspection history, conducted a metallurgical exam and was evaluating whether to adjust blade inspections. </p><p>   The FAA declined to comment about its work with Boeing on 777 engine covers. </p><p>   Since the Colorado 777 incident, Boeing has shared some of the changes it is considering to shore up 737 engine covers with carriers, said people briefed on the matter. It has been in talks with United about potential changes to 777 engine covers, according to a person familiar with those discussions. Boeing and the FAA declined to comment on when 777 or 737 engine-cover fixes would be completed. </p><p>   Japanese regulators grounded the aircraft the day after the Colorado incident. Soon thereafter, Mr. Dickson ordered immediate specialized inspections even while some FAA officials didn't believe such drastic action was necessary, said people familiar with the agency's response. </p><p>   The move effectively took more than 50 Boeing 777s -- all operated by United -- out of service for months, until inspections have been completed. </p><p>   Tom Haueter, a former NTSB director of aviation safety, said: \"They grounded the fleet -- that's about as aggressive as you can get.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Chieko Tsuneoka, Benjamin Katz and Doug Cameron contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
