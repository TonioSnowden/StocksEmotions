  "title": "Boeing's Starliner Successfully Docks With Space Station; Spacecraft reaches important milestone on test mission and is scheduled to depart from the facility next week",
  "text": "<p>Next week, the vehicle is expected to depart the station and land under parachutes in a desert site in the western part of the U.S., according to NASA.</p><p>Completing the mission would set the stage for Boeing to use Starliner for high-profile astronaut flights. It would also give the company a win as it faces challenges with many of its aircraft programs, including the 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner jets.</p><p>Before docking with the research facility, the Starliner completed a series of maneuvers to demonstrate its capabilities. Flight controllers have been gathering information about how the vehicle operates in space. The capsule isn't carrying crew members on the demonstration mission.</p><p>Afterlaunching Thursday evening, two thrusters used for maneuvering the Starliner failed, but a third functioned as expected, allowing the vehicle to stay on track. The thrusters that failed were among a subset of those devices on the vehicle. Boeing said earlier Friday that teams concluded a drop in pressure caused the two thrusters to cut off.</p><p>With other thrusters available, the failures don't \"pose a risk to the rest of the flight test,\" the company said. Boeing also said teams were investigating an issue with a thermal-cooling device on the Starliner, but subsystems were maintaining stable temperatures.</p><p>So far, Boeing hasn't been able to complete an uncrewed test mission. A software error botched an attempt in 2019, and valves on the vehicle became stuck last summer before a makeup launch, causing months of delays while Boeing and NASA worked to address the issue.</p><p>The capsule carried food and other cargo to the space station and is set to bring other items back to Earth, with a scheduled departure from the station on May 25.</p><p>The space agency currently uses vehicles operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX for astronaut missions to the space station but wants to have two U.S. companies available to provide that service.</p><p>Write to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing's Starliner Successfully Docks With Space Station</p>",
