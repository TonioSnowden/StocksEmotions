  "text": "<p>A Boeing 737 passenger plane with 132 people on board crashed in southern China on Monday, in what threatens to be the country's worst air disaster in recent years.</p> <p>China Eastern Airlines said flight MU5735 crashed in a mountain range in Guangxi province an hour after take-off. The flight was travelling from Kunming to the city of Guangzhou.</p> <p>No information on casualties or the cause of the crash was immediately available. Flight tracking websites showed that the route was being flown by a 737-800 and not a Boeing 737 Max, which was grounded in 2019 after two fatal crashes. Shares in the US plane manufacturer fell more than 7 per cent to $181 in early morning trading in New York. </p> <p>Chinese state media quoted China Eastern as saying it would ground all of its 737-800s starting on Tuesday. </p> <p>Data from tracker Flightradar24 showed the six-year-old plane travelling at 29,100 feet before it began to rapidly lose speed and altitude.</p> <p>The flight was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China. The aviation regulator said it had activated its emergency response measures and was sending a team to the crash site.</p> <p>The fire department in Wuzhou, where the plane went down, said the aircraft crashed in a remote area and 450 firefighters were heading to the scene of the accident, according to state media.</p> <p>A six-second video clip circulating on Chinese social media on Monday shows a black plane nosediving headfirst into the ground. A Chinese mining company confirmed to the local press that the footage was taken by one of its security cameras, located one kilometre away from the crash site.</p> <p>On Monday President Xi Jinping said a team of “leading comrades” had been dispatched to carry out the rescue operation and investigate the cause of the crash. He instructed them to scrutinise any links to previous accidents.</p> <p>Boeing said it was “aware of the initial media reports and working to gather more information”. </p> <p>The crash could be one of China's worst aviation disasters in two decades after a succession of accidents in the 1990s, which officials blamed on the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/448b059e-4ea4-11e8-9471-a083af05aea7\">rapid growth of the aviation industry</a> without strict regulatory oversight. </p> <p>Over the past two decades, China has suffered fewer accidents after the country upgraded its fleet and introduced tighter government controls and regulatory scrutiny. </p> <p>The Boeing 737-800 aircraft that crashed on Monday differs from the two larger Max series aircraft that crashed in Indonesia and Ethiopia within six months of each other, killing a combined 346 people.</p> <p>The global fleet of 737 Max aircraft was grounded for two years after the incidents involving an Indonesian carrier in October 2018 and an Ethiopian airline in March 2019. Boeing last year <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cc688f26-987e-4f2f-9011-6cdcffe582c9\">reached a $2.5bn settlement</a> to compensate the families of those killed in the accidents.</p> <p>China was the last big market where the Boeing 737 Max was still awaiting approval to resume flying. The US allowed flights to restart in December 2020, followed by EU regulators in January 2021.</p> <p>China is a vital growth market for both Boeing and its European rival Airbus.</p> <p>Shares in China Eastern were 6.3 per cent lower on the day in late trading in Hong Kong. </p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Maiqi Ding and Oliver Ralph</em></p><p>Source: Edward White in Seoul, Ryan McMorrow in Beijing, Eleanor Olcott and Sylvia Pfeifer in London 2022 'Boeing 737 passenger plane crashes in southern China' FT.com 21 March.
