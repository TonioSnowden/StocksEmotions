  "text": "<p>   Whether China's spending is effective remains controversial. Chinese chip companies remain behind leading Western competitors. Mr. Kennedy of CSIS estimated China has injected between $49 billion and $72 billion into state-owned aircraft maker Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) in a so-far-unsuccessful effort to make it a competitor to Airbus and Boeing. </p><p>   Even if other countries spent as much as China, they would likely struggle to achieve truly independent supply chains because China dominates so many of the links. When semiconductor chips are fabricated in the U.S. they still must undergo assembly, packaging and testing, a low-margin business where China is the biggest player. </p><p>   In the 1980s the U.S. imposed restrictions on imports from Japan of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips to protect U.S. market share, but DRAM chips became a commodity business whipsawed by booms and busts. Production has almost entirely left the U.S. </p><p>   Mr. Warner knows the lesson well. As governor of Virginia, he, like two predecessors, directed state aid to a memory-chip plant just outside Richmond operated by a spinoff of Germany's Infineon Technologies AG. In 2009, amid a global glut driving down memory-chip prices, the spinoff entered bankruptcy protection and closed the facility, laying off more than 1,000 employees. </p><p>   Mr. Warner said U.S. semiconductor subsidies must be allocated through a clear, rigorous process without political interference. But \"the truth is you could have a panel that makes exactly the right decisions, technology could leapfrog and, five years later, the valid choices made in 2021 could look pretty stupid,\" he said. </p><p>   Mr. Warner said the U.S. has little choice because semiconductor fabs are going to be built and without federal intervention they'll go to China. \"I was a venture capitalist before I was a politician,\" Mr. Warner said. \"This is the kind of bet America has to make.\" </p><p></p>",
