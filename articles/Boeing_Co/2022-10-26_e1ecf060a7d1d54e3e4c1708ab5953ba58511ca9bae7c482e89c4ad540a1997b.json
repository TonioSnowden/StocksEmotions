  "title": "Stock Futures Drop on Weak Tech Earnings; Facebook parent Meta Platforms is scheduled to post earnings after the market close",
  "text": "<p>Stocks have gotten a boost in recent days, lifted by some better-than-expected corporate earnings and hopes that the Federal Reserve may reduce the pace of interest-rate increases. Sentiment took a U-turn overnight after Alphabet and Microsoft reported their quarterly results on Tuesday after markets closed.</p><p>\"These companies are really important bellwethers on advertising and on flows of goods and services,\" said Fahad Kamal, chief investment officer at Kleinwort Hambros. \"If advertising growth is slowing over there, it is adding weight to that fear of an earnings slowdown.\"</p><p>In premarket trading, shares of Alphabet lost 6%. The company's revenue growth last quarter dropped to the lowest level in more than two years and its YouTube video platform posted a drop in advertising sales for the first time. Microsoft declined 6.3% after it reported the weakest revenue growth in over five years and said it expects a sharp decline in personal computer sales.</p><p>\"We've gotten used to tech being strong in every single quarter. There was hope that they would be so sharp that it would be another signal that tech is resilient,\" said Esty Dwek, chief investment officer at FlowBank.</p><p>On Wednesday, Kraft Heinz, Boeing and Harley-Davidson are scheduled to post earnings before markets open. Reports from Meta Platforms and Ford Motor are due after the close.</p><p>Data on the housing market is expected at 10 a.m. ET with new home sales for September.</p><p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note edged down to 4.071% from 4.109% on Tuesday.</p><p>The dollar weakened, with the WSJ Dollar Index down 0.6% to its lowest level in over three weeks. The euro strengthened 0.6% and the British pound appreciated 0.8% against the greenback.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged down 0.2%. Dutch brewer Heineken dropped 8% after it missed analysts' expectations on volume growth and the company said it has a cautious outlook.</p><p>In Asia, most major benchmarks rose. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.8% and Japan's Nikkei 225 added 0.7%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 1%, regaining some ground after the index suffered its worst one-day drop since the global financial crisis earlier in the week.</p><p>Write to Anna Hirtenstein at anna.hirtenstein@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Futures Drop on Weak Tech Earnings</p>",
