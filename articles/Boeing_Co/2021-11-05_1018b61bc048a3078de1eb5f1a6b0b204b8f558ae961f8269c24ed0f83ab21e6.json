  "title": "Boeing Directors Settle MAX Suit --- Insurers to pay $225 million; shareholders said board failed to oversee safety of jet",
  "text": "<p>The settlement isn't expected to include an admission of wrongdoing on the part of the directors, including Chief Executive David Calhoun, some of the people said.</p><p>Mr. Calhoun, a director since 2009, was among board members who oversaw management during the airplane's development and between two MAX accidents, which took 346 lives.</p><p>The monetary portion of the settlement would be paid by directors' insurers to the corporation, the people familiar with the agreement said.</p><p>The proposed settlement was expected to be filed in Delaware's Court of Chancery as soon as Friday and would require a judge's approval, some of these people said.</p><p>Two of Boeing's 737 MAX jets crashed in late 2018 and early 2019.</p><p>The company has since shaken up its board and management and changed how it handles safety, including adding a board committee focused on the topic.</p><p>Lead plaintiffs in the case are administrators of two public pension funds: New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees the New York State and Local Retirement System; and the Fire and Police Pension Association of Colorado.</p><p>Among its claims, the lawsuit alleged Boeing's board failed to challenge then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg over 737 MAX safety issues or his campaign to counter negative news reports between the two fatal accidents.</p><p>The suit also claimed Boeing's Mr. Calhoun, who previously served as lead director and chairman, exaggerated to journalists the extent of directors' safety oversight.</p><p>Boeing argued the plaintiffs' suit gave an incomplete and misleading picture of directors' safety oversight.</p><p>The company has also said the plaintiffs misrepresented Mr. Calhoun's public comments about board oversight.</p><p>The proposed settlement would come weeks after the judge overseeing the case, Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn of Delaware's Court of Chancery, denied Boeing's attempt to have the suit dismissed.</p><p>After the second crash in 2019, Boeing's board formed a safety committee as part of a broader revamp aimed at increasing senior leaders' oversight of engineering and safety matters.</p><p>Accident investigators in the crash largely blamed a faulty flight-control system for sending the jets into fatal nosedives.</p><p>The Boeing case is different from a securities-fraud lawsuit through which plaintiffs themselves might recoup investment losses.</p><p>Known as a shareholder derivative complaint, such legal actions seek to hold company officials responsible for alleged missteps and could result in defendants or their insurers paying monetary damages to a corporation and prompt internal governance changes.</p><p>The plaintiffs in the Boeing case drew upon thousands of internal board documents such as meeting minutes and emails they accessed under Delaware state law.</p><p>Last year, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. settled with plaintiffs who filed a similar legal action related to the scandal over the bank's sales tactics, according to court documents in the case.</p><p>The agreement included $240 million paid by defendants' insurers to the corporation, as well as governance changes and clawbacks, according to the court documents.</p>",
