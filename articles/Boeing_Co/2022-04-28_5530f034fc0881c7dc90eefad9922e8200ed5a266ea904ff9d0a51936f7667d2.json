  "text": "<p>   Senior FAA officials have been broadly pleased with Boeing's improvements but not with their pace, according to people familiar with the matter. Agency officials have at times complained to the plane maker's executives that lower-level Boeing employees who work with the FAA haven't seemed to be getting the message, those people said. In February, Mr. Dickson said Boeing overall had \"really improved the discipline within their engineering organization.\" </p><p>   If Boeing manages to resume Dreamliner deliveries this summer, the freeze will have lasted about as long as the grounding of its 737 MAX. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Micah Maidenberg contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
