They argue that including the tax hikes in a bill later this year would be economically harmful and could torpedo the legislation.<br><br>In addition to higher corporate taxes, Biden has proposed increasing capital gains taxes on individuals earning more than $1m and higher payroll taxes for high income households. </p> <h2>Coronavirus digest</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>India</strong> has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/741090f3-5023-3a78-a9d3-0d7b394f2616\">stepped up efforts</a> to curb the spread as case numbers top 11m.</p></li>  <li><p>BioNTech/Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine has been highly effective at <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2626ec05-5bc5-4121-afc4-be62c29c4894\">preventing infection</a> in <strong>Israel</strong>, according to the first real-world data showing that vaccination stops transmission of the virus.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>Australia</strong> began its <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/2/21/australia-begins-covid-19-vaccinations-with-pfizer-biontech\">BioNTech/Pfizer Covid-19 vaccinations</a> ahead of schedule on Sunday with Prime Minister Scott Morrison among the first to receive a shot. <strong>New Zealand</strong> also began <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/741090f3-5023-3a78-a9d3-0d7b394f2616#post-60931\">vaccinating border control workers</a> at the weekend.</p></li>  <li><p><strong>US</strong> Covid-19 hospitalisations fell for a 40th consecutive day as the number of new cases and fatalities also declined. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7b0db882-a369-4e32-a86a-eb7fda2a0da0\">Racial inequality</a> has plagued the country's vaccine rollout, with people living in areas hit hardest by virus being inoculated at a slower rate, according to FT analysis.</p></li> </ul> <p><em>Tim Harford asks can we afford to pay for </em><a href=\"http://ft.com/content/21e42111-cf81-4001-bb19-5f7a993836af\"><em>catch-up tuition</em></a><em> for children learning remotely during the pandemic?

The moves come as tensions rise between the west and China that have left the Hong Kong-founded, UK-headquartered bank in a precarious position.

(FT)</p> <p><strong>Myanmar protesters defy threats of violence </strong>Throngs of protesters joined a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5f61da58-e618-42a8-b13c-300567248ff1\">general strike</a> against Myanmar's military junta on Monday in what organisers said was the biggest day of defiance since the coup, brushing aside a growing threat of violence by the regime.

It will rely mostly on improved financial modelling and disclosure rather than green asset purchases, according to several top policymakers. (FT)</p> <p><strong>Chinese law to allow coast guard use of arms </strong>The US has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/14d52b20-b104-4d59-a8e0-ef211e1b08c4\">expressed concern</a> about a new law that authorises the Chinese coast guard to fire on foreign ships operating in disputed waters claimed by Beijing in the South China Sea and East China Sea.

(Bloomberg) </p> <h2>The days ahead</h2> <p><strong>Putin-Lukashenko talks </strong>Russia's president Vladimir Putin will on Monday hold talks with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, who has faced intense political pressure from the opposition since a contested election last year. There have been echoes of the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fc83d419-adc2-4836-a921-28cb52d82fcf\">Belarusian protests</a> in Russia's Navalny protests.

On Sunday Matt Hancock, health secretary, said the UK government would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3a0434e5-8cac-4922-8f0f-062db0604115\">not accelerate plans to ease lockdown</a> despite indications that the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6d4ff17b-b3a2-4f9a-bb73-84e50ba614b6\">coronavirus vaccination is working</a>. (FT) </p> <h2>What else we're reading</h2> <p><strong>Billionaires' Row developer raises cash after property slump </strong>Extell Development, the real estate group behind some of the supertall towers of Manhattan's Billionaires' Row, is <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/736825e3-1893-48d5-b011-53518fdf3680\">raising more than $300m</a> through the sale of a stake in its lesser-known properties, as it wrestles with a slump in the market for luxury apartments. (FT)</p> <p><strong>Nikkei 30,000 brings back memories of 1980s mania </strong>The historic resonance of 1990 is powerful and these are heights that have not once, in 30 years, felt remotely recoverable, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0b511b8f-bdcd-41a6-9382-97595432e303\">writes Leo Lewis</a>. But there are also signs retail investors are changing Japan's markets. (FT) </p> <p><strong>Silicon Beach, or just another warm tax haven? </strong>Covid-19, coupled with the fear of rising taxes and regulation on the coasts, has accelerated corporate migration to southern states, writes Rana Foroohar. But the “techxodus” <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4076cf91-ad82-4143-b21b-ea1f9e75c19c\">must not become a race to the bottom</a>, in which cities end up giving away far more than they receive in property breaks or job creation tax credits. (FT) </p> <p><strong>The rise of the US's anti-Asian racism </strong>In 2019 there was just one reported incident of an anti-Asian hate crime in New York City. Last year, there were 20, according to New York Police Department data. As crimes against Asians increase, <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/author/kathleen-hou/\">Kathleen Hou</a> reflects on breaking out of a culture of “swallowing the bitterness”. (The Cut) </p> <p><strong>Colombia weighs a new aerial war on drugs </strong>With drug production soaring, Bogotá wants to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03b032e9-a745-4ea5-a718-13d86fe6fec0\">revive </a>its crop-spraying programme. But in 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer found that glyphosate, which was sprayed from the planes, was “probably carcinogenic for humans”. (FT) </p> <p><strong>Why once successful countries like the UK get left behind </strong>Since the global financial crisis, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/217f6d28-5a3e-48e0-bf6e-c2618da8f34b\">UK productivity</a> has been&#xa0;virtually stagnant, writes Martin Wolf. The decline in productivity growth is not unique to the UK, but the country's deterioration was the biggest out of all G7 leading high-income economies, and a lack of innovation could be the problem. (FT)</p> <p><strong>Toxic offices don't change when they go virtual </strong>Even though staff are working from home, indefensible behaviour never stops, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ebd22d66-c4bb-47a0-8a34-e3cf8e0472b4\">writes Pilita Clark.</a> A new book by&#xa0;British business psychologist Clive Lewis also points out that such toxic behaviour is not just inhumane, it is costly to businesses.
