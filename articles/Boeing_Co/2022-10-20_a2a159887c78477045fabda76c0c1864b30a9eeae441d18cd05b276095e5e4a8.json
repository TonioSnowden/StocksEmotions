  "title": "At American Airlines, First Class Out, Business Class In for International Trips; American replacing first class with new business-class seats as distinction between the two gets blurrier",
  "text": "<p>The distinction between business class and first class has blurred over the years, with first-class cabins becoming less common and business-class offerings getting fancier. More deluxe business-class offerings have already supplanted first class on international flights at Delta Air Lines Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc.</p><p>\"And frankly, by removing [first-class seats], we can provide more business-class seats, which is what our customers most want or are most willing to pay for.\"</p><p>American said last month that it would phase out the first-class product offered on certain long-haul flights. Instead, the airline will outfit its long-haul fleet with new \"Flagship Suites,\" which include seats that lie flat and sliding doors for privacy, in a revamp that will increase premium seating on those planes by more than 45% by 2026.</p><p>The new suites will be included on newly delivered Boeing 787-9 planes and Airbus A321 XLRs starting in 2024. American will also retrofit its Boeing 777-300ER planes to include the new suites.</p><p>The shift comes as airlines are looking to add more premium seating to flights to appeal to travelers willing to pay more for additional perks. Airline executives have said that travelers have been increasingly open to shelling out for a more comfortable ride. Seats that were once largely reserved for frequent fliers using free upgrades are now often filled with paying customers, generating more revenue for airlines.</p><p>Mr. Raja said Thursday that big corporate customers used to fill about half the airline's premium cabins. Now, he said, customers traveling for a mix of business and leisure, as well as leisure travelers paying for their own tickets, are increasingly buying the higher-end seats.</p><p>Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com</p><p>At American Airlines, First Class Out, Business Class In for International Trips</p>",
