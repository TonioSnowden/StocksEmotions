  "text": "<p>   SpaceX blasted another crew toward the International Space Station, launching a group that includes a Russian cosmonaut amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and Russia. </p><p>   Four people began their flight to the station on a Crew Dragon vehicle that SpaceX launched around noon ET Wednesday using one of its reusable Falcon 9 boosters, according to a live stream from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. </p><p>   The second stage of the vehicle separated from the booster shortly after takeoff and fired its engine to send the Dragon toward the space station. The spacecraft is expected to reach the facility at roughly 5 p.m. Thursday. </p><p>   The mission, which SpaceX is carrying out for NASA, marks the sixth time SpaceX has flown astronauts to the station for the space agency since 2020, and comes after NASA has moved to deepen its relationship with the Elon Musk-led company. </p><p>   In separate deals this year, NASA awarded Space Exploration Technologies Corp., as SpaceX is formally called, a total of eight additional crewed flights to the research facility, according to agency statements. </p><p>   Those additional missions are expected to occur over the next few years until 2030, NASA has said. Together, they increased the total value of the company's contract with the agency for crew flights to the research facility from $2.7 billion to more than $4.9 billion. </p><p>   Benji Reed, senior director for human spaceflight programs at SpaceX, said the company benefits from knowing it has those flights, along with others, to work toward. Having \"an ongoing manifest of missions is great because folks get to plan and repeat and practice that effort,\" Mr. Reed said. </p><p>   Right now, SpaceX is the only space-transport provider NASA has certified to handle human missions, though Boeing Co. has been aiming to gain that status for its Starliner spacecraft after working through technical challenges and completing an uncrewed test flight to the station in May. </p><p>   NASA itself hasn't launched a rocket capable of transporting astronauts since 2011, when it conducted a space shuttle mission for the last time. NASA is aiming to reignite those ambitions under its Artemis program, which seeks to eventually return astronauts to the lunar surface. </p><p>   The agency has struggled with technical challenges, including fuel leaks, that prevented engineers from blasting off its rocket for Artemis on an uncrewed test flight in August, and again last month. </p><p>   NASA recently said it may try again to launch the SLS rocket in November. </p><p>   The flight Wednesday will send four people to the space station: Nicole Aunapu Mann and Josh Cassada from the U.S. space agency; Koichi Wakata from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; and Anna Kikina, from the Russian space agency Roscosmos. Ms. Mann became the first Native American woman in space with the launch, according to NASA. </p><p>   The quartet is expected to stay on board the station for about 150 days, conducting science experiments and research, officials have said. A group of astronauts who traveled to the orbiting lab with SpaceX back in April will overlap with the new crew for several days before returning to Earth in a Crew Dragon that is currently docked to the facility. </p><p>   Ms. Kikina, the Russian cosmonaut, is flying with SpaceX in a crew swap between NASA and Roscosmos. As part of that agreement, NASA astronaut Frank Rubio recently arrived at the space station on a Russian spacecraft, NASA has said. </p><p>   Roscosmos has threatened to pull out of the space station, with the agency's new leader saying over the summer it would leave at an unspecified time after 2024. NASA officials, who want to keep the station operating through 2030, have said they have never received official notification that Russia would exit the facility. </p><p>   Sergei Krikalev, executive director for human space flight programs at Roscosmos, said at a briefing after the launch that the flight and crew swap with NASA marked a \"new phase\" of the agencies' cooperation. </p><p>   The latest SpaceX mission for NASA comes during a busy stretch for the company, and as Mr. Musk juggles multiple responsibilities elsewhere. The entrepreneur, who also serves as chief executive at Tesla Inc. and has founded startups, recently offered to complete his purchase of Twitter Inc. </p><p></p>",
