  "text": "<p><strong>One huge job move to start:</strong> <strong>Amazon </strong>chief executive <strong>Jeff Bezos </strong>will step aside later this year to become executive chairman, making way for <strong>Andy Jassy</strong>, who currently heads up its cloud computing division,<strong> AWS</strong>, to replace him in the role. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b100100e-48d9-4b06-86e0-ed81dd9eee92\">More here</a>.</p> <p><strong>And one FT film to start:</strong> It has been called a telecoms group, a semiconductor group, an investment group — even a hedge fund — but what exactly is <strong>SoftBank</strong>? Our FT colleagues, including DD's Arash Massoudi, piece together the puzzle. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/video/49e2f1ee-c923-47f7-ac6d-7f8e1747305b\">Watch here</a>.</p> <p><strong>Welcome to the Due Diligence briefing from the Financial Times.

But Black has said that he “profoundly regret[s]” the relationship, and last week <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/97fdc05b-d3cd-45b7-b155-5f4ab525c59a\">stepped down</a> as Apollo's chief executive — while remaining as chairman — and pledged to give $200m to charity.</p> <p>The Dechert report was “not enough” for the <strong>UN</strong>'s $80.3bn pension fund to remove the company from a watchlist of investments that require extra scrutiny, the UN's head of investments <strong>Pedro Guazo</strong>, told <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/62573344-9060-4168-94dd-11ab27ea3594\">DD's Francesca Friday</a>. Apollo was placed on the list in July 2019, as attention focused on Epstein's ties to multiple Wall Street figures.</p> <p>Another Apollo investor, <strong>Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds</strong>, said it would not make new investments with the group. The <strong>Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System</strong>, which put new investments on hold last autumn, gave no indication it was ready to start funding Apollo again.&#xa0;</p> <p>But others have been more forgiving — among them, the UK's<strong> South Yorkshire Pensions Authority</strong>, which committed almost £29m across three Apollo funds between 2013 and 2019. Its director <strong>George Graham</strong> said that Apollo's actions “demonstrate a commitment to learning and improving from things that go wrong”.</p> <p>Several equity analysts have said they expect more Apollo investors to be won round in the coming weeks. That would be a fitting next chapter for Black, who built his empire on second chances — spinning the debt of troubled companies into Wall Street gold.</p> <h2>UK M&amp;A gets political</h2> <p>Typically when politicians hang up their hats, they find a cosy spot on a reputable company's advisory board to wait out retirement — “trophy cabinets” as they're sometimes known.</p> <p>Not <strong>George Osborne</strong>. The former UK chancellor, who has already taken an unconventional path since leaving politics by taking up simultaneous roles at London's <strong>Evening Standard</strong> newspaper (where he is the editor), and <strong>BlackRock </strong>(where he holds a one-day-a-week advisory role that pays £650,000 a year), fancies <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/99ea2488-fe1d-407f-9dda-a537d7471d65\">taking dealmaking for a spin</a>.</p> <p>Quite the renaissance man.</p> <p>He's heading to London's ultra-successful boutique advisory firm <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9065270d-5403-40ee-83f5-1eae152d99c5\"><strong>Robey Warshaw</strong></a> to become a full-time M&amp;A banker.</p> <p>His appointment is unusual given that when firms are <em>this</em> successful, they look to recruiting new partners from big investment banks to expand, not outsiders, as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/185149e3-ddbd-466d-95d2-55e32f29709b\">Lex points out</a>.</p> <p>It's also the first time the firm has extended its partnership beyond its three founding members: ex-<strong>Morgan Stanley</strong> bankers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3e99239e-1e7f-11ea-b8a1-584213ee7b2b\"><strong>Sir Simon Robey</strong></a> and <strong>Philip Apostolides</strong>, and former <strong>UBS</strong> rainmaker <strong>Simon Warshaw</strong>.</p> <p>But there's sound logic behind this: completing a big M&amp;A deal requires navigating a minefield of bureaucratic and regulatory pitfalls (see:<strong> LSE Group</strong>'s long-awaited $27bn <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1266dcec-e62e-4f11-8988-dfb4e5be2d3c\">takeover</a> of <strong>Refinitiv</strong> on which Robey Warshaw served as an adviser).&#xa0;</p> <p>Then there are the additional challenges brought on by new measures in the UK that will give the government greater power to intervene in M&amp;A.&#xa0;</p> <p>Osborne's deep network of political and business contacts won't just help the firm secure new business, but potentially help navigate those obstacles on behalf of clientele including <strong>BP</strong>, <strong>Centrica</strong>, <strong>Vodafone</strong> and the <strong>London Stock Exchange Group</strong>.</p> <p>On the flip side, Robey Warshaw has thrived partially because it is such a low-key operation, with just three partners and less than 15 staff. By enlisting a former public figure, with a chequered political career, there will be much greater scrutiny on the firm's activities.</p> <h2>Cineworld's legal drama</h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/66fa243d-347b-4dd0-bfb9-57097795c34c\">Tuesday's DD</a>, we brought you news that not only is <strong>Kirkland &amp; Ellis</strong> now the world's highest-grossing law firm, but it is also on track to generate a record $5bn in revenues in the 12 months to the end of January.</p> <p>It follows a year in which three of the Chicago-founded megafirm's strongest areas — private equity, restructuring and litigation — all generated strong growth.</p> <p>But while Kirkland may be prospering in the pandemic, the firm and one of its clients have also been involved in one of the more surreal spats to hit credit markets in recent months.</p> <p><strong>Cineworld</strong> had spent the first weeks of 2021 in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1172affa-730e-4852-942b-d706fc41dfd8\">dispute with lenders</a> over a small increase in the interest rate on billions of dollars worth of loans.</p> <p>The London-listed cinema chain and its legal advisers at Kirkland have argued this rate increase was mistakenly introduced into the company's loan documents, during negotiations with creditors in November.</p> <p>Mistakes happen, particularly when everyone is rushing to sign a deal intended to stave off bankruptcy. But Cineworld and its advisers <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11f0dea6-a748-4043-83f2-23c4a48481ad\">hit a dead wall</a> in trying to persuade <strong>Barclays</strong> — the loan's agent — that the apparent error should be amended.</p> <p>While the company has backed down for now and paid the first of its increased interest payments, we don't think this is the last we will be hearing of the dispute.&#xa0;</p> <h2>Job moves</h2> <ul>  <li><p><strong>Commerzbank </strong>has fired its former <strong>Wirecard </strong>analyst <strong>Heike Pauls</strong> after emails showed that she had briefed the disgraced payment company's management about criticism of it that a hedge fund had shared with her. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/42c49252-9155-402f-b799-75f0700f2aee\">More here</a>.</p></li> </ul> <ul>  <li><p>Veteran banker <strong>Tim Coleman</strong>, who built a career on turning debt restructuring into a lucrative business on Wall Street, is retiring as a partner and global chairman of <strong>PJT Partners</strong>.
