  "text": "<p>When Brazil had too few vaccines to cope with the deadly third wave of coronavirus, Ethiopian Airlines came to the rescue. It transported 3.5m Sinovac jabs from Shanghai to São Paulo, via specialist facilities at its hub in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, in April.</p> <p>“I feel that our efficient and timely delivery of vaccines will save millions of lives that could have been lost,” says Tewolde Gebremariam, chief executive. Having overseen the expansion of Africa's largest carrier since 2011, he has not only navigated the pandemic but led its push to transport Covid vaccines across Africa and beyond. </p> <p>Founded in 1945 by Emperor Haile Selassie I — its headquarters building is H-shaped in his honour — the state-owned company's hub in Addis Ababa is one of the largest and most modern African cargo terminals, able to handle 1m tonnes a year. </p> <p>So far, Ethiopian Airlines has carried more than 27m vaccines to 24 countries. It has a 54,000 sq m freezer facility in Addis Ababa for Covid-19 vaccines that can keep the temperature at -25C, and is developing a facility to make enough ice to keep vaccines ultra-cold when needed.</p> <p>While most airlines on the continent suffered badly during the pandemic, Ethiopian Airlines has kept flying by converting many of its planes to carry cargo, including big long-range passenger aircraft. “We were very creative in removing seats from the aeroplanes,” Tewolde says. </p> <p>The airline, which has 132 aircraft, including 12 dedicated cargo planes, has also delivered Covid-related medical equipment to nearly every country in Africa, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c17614d0-cd94-4160-af0b-32dae6940253\">as well as to Latin America</a>, after refitting 25 passenger aircraft for cargo. Tewolde says cargo was a “lifesaver” after passengers “vanished overnight”.</p> <p>Ethiopian Airlines' revenue from its passenger business fell by $1bn in 2020. But, overall, the group made $220m in profit last year thanks to cargo, maintenance and other businesses. </p> <p>Analysts attribute much of its resilience to its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7be9f07e-c99d-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0\">state owner</a>, which does not demand dividends and can keep costs down. Tewolde is confident the airline will make money this year, too.</p> <p>One challenge from before the pandemic was a crash two years ago that killed all 157 people aboard a Boeing 737 Max aircraft. The company is in the “final stage” of talks with the manufacturer <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1e64a9ea-4659-4513-b82f-0a4b5e7cae1c\">over compensation</a>, says Tewolde. </p> <p>More recently, the airline has been accused of treating ethnic Tigrayan staff unfairly as the northern region of the country remains gripped by a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/23021d09-5dac-4ff5-b2a9-6b040ffdc6db\">brutal civil war</a> with the government. Tewolde rejects the accusations as “fabrications” and re-emphasises his focus is on surviving the pandemic.</p> <p>“We think we are the only airline in the world that has managed this unprecedented global pandemic crisis . . . without any bailout money from any source,” he says. “And without any lay-off of employees or reducing their salaries.”</p><p>Source: Andres Schipani in Addis Ababa 2021 'How Ethiopian Airlines provided a vaccine lifeline ' FT.com 1 June.
