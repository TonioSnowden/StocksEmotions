  "title": "United Airlines Maintenance Error Snarls Some Flights; FAA said United failed to perform an inspection on part of wings on about two dozen Boeing 777s, leading to canceled flights",
  "text": "<p>United said Tuesday that it has now completed inspections for 10 of the planes and is working with the FAA to return the others to service.</p><p>United caught the problem in an audit and reported it to the FAA, the airline said. About 18 flights, most of them long-haul international trips, were scrubbed as a result, but United said it doesn't expect additional cancellations while it finishes the remaining inspections over the next two weeks.</p><p>The problem is a setback for United as it looks to restore its international flying schedule in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and a prolonged grounding of its 777-200 planes for unrelated reasons.</p><p>United's 777-200 jets have only recently returned to service after being effectively grounded for over a year due to a problem with the plane's external engine covers. The wing panel inspection United missed wasn't related to the engine issues and wasn't an element of returning the plane to service, but rather a routine maintenance matter, the FAA said. Some of the planes that missed inspections were still parked and hadn't yet returned to flying.</p><p>The missed inspections are meant to examine the area of the wing where slats extend during take off and landing to generate lift. The FAA said it is reviewing United's plan to perform the inspections, and looking into how they were missed.</p><p>Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com and Andrew Tangel at andrew.tangel@wsj.com</p><p>United Airlines Maintenance Error Snarls Some Flights</p>",
