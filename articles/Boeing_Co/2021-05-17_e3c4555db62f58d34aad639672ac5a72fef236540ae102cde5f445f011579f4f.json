  "text": "<p>Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has blasted a “complacent” Boeing for delays in delivering the airline's troubled 737 Max aircraft.</p> <p>The low-cost carrier handed Boeing a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c32696e-56fc-43a5-b3d4-49daa169bcbd\">major boost</a> with a multibillion-dollar deal for 75 of the planes in December, the first firm Max order since the jet was grounded for 20 months after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/880bab31-4ea0-4459-99f3-3cf315684e6d\">two fatal accidents within five months</a>.&#xa0;</p> <p>But on Monday, O'Leary said Boeing had not delivered 14 aircraft expected in April and May, accusing the US company of mishandling its relationships with safety regulators — a particularly sensitive issue following the crashes. </p> <p>Boeing paused deliveries of the Max in April <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a53918dc-1eb5-4606-b37e-30ee1fd8e758\">over an electrical issue</a>, and promised to catch up on deliveries&#xa0;through the rest of the year.&#xa0;</p> <p>“I&#xa0;think it's disappointing and unacceptable. Certainly, if they're treating the regulator with the same radio silence that they're treating customers, I'd be very worried about the durability of the aircraft,” O'Leary said on a company results call on Monday.</p> <p>While O'Leary has not spared Boeing from his withering criticism of large parts of the industry over the years, he had become a strident supporter of the troubled Max aircraft. </p> <p>Boeing said: “We continue to work with Ryanair to support their fleet requirements.”</p> <p>O'Leary's comments came as <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/37277011-174d-4927-93fa-d3058533cd2e\">Ryanair slumped to the steepest annual loss in its 35-year history</a> as the coronavirus crisis devastated international travel.</p> <p>But Europe's largest low-cost carrier hopes an air travel recovery has already begun that will strengthen in the coming months after an <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/161e12df-c81b-4bfd-882d-72e7c40fb9b6\">uptick in weekly bookings in the past month</a>.</p> <p>O'Leary said demand for flights would bounce back over the summer and return to 80 or 90 per cent of pre-pandemic traffic volumes from October.</p> <p>“We see a very strong recovery of traffic subject to the continuing success of the vaccine rollout programme through summer 2021,” he said in a pre-recorded message.</p> <p>The carrier described last year as the most challenging in history after Covid-19 restrictions led to an 80 per cent drop in passengers to 27.5m in the year ending in March, leading to a net loss of €815m. </p> <p>That was down from 148.6m passengers and a net profit of just over €1bn a year earlier before the pandemic struck, but slightly better than analysts' expectations.</p> <p>It reiterated that passenger numbers this year would be at the lower end of an 80m-120m range in a sign that there was still a way to go to reach pre-pandemic levels. </p> <p>In the first quarter from April to June, the airline expects to only carry between 5m-6m passengers, as governments keep their borders shut.</p> <p>However, there have been promising signs of a recovery taking hold. Customer bookings tripled from 500,000 in the first week of April to more than 1.5m last week.</p> <p>Airlines hope Covid-19 vaccines will pave the way for the return of international travel in Europe and the US over the summer after a torrid 15 months. But the circulation of virus variants is prompting caution from governments over reopening borders.</p> <p>Ryanair did not give any formal earnings guidance for the current financial year, but it said it was likely to come close to break-even.</p> <p>Analysts said its annual earnings hinged on the possible addition of Italy and Greece by the end of May and Spain by early June to the UK's green list for travel.</p> <p>“As with other airlines in the sector, much rests on the relaxation of travel restrictions by peak summer to revive earnings,” said Daniel Roeska, an analyst at Bernstein.</p> <p><em>This article has been amended to state that Ryanair's passenger numbers reached 27.5m in the year ending in March, not 146.8m as wrongly reported in a previous version.</em></p><p>Source: Harry Dempsey and Philip Georgiadis in London 2021 'O'Leary slams ‘complacent' Boeing over Max delivery delays' FT.com 17 May.
