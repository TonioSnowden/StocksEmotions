  "text": "<p>Raytheon said it remains committed to the mix of hybrid and remote work it developed during the Covid-19 pandemic that at one point involved more than half of its 174,000 employees working from home. While more are now back in the office, the company has created campuses at some facilities for hot-desking and is reducing its office real estate footprint by one-fifth.</p><p>\"The company has proven the effectiveness of a remote or hybrid working model, with employees working where they need to be to perform at an optimal level,\" said a Raytheon spokesman.</p><p>Raytheon said it plans to retain its existing facility in Waltham, which became the company's global headquarters following its creation through the merger of Raytheon Co. and United Technologies Corp. in April 2020.</p><p>The maker of Pratt &amp; Whitney engines and Patriot missile-defense systems joins most of the major U.S. aerospace and defense companies in basing in the D.C. area.</p><p>Boeing Co. last month announced plans to move its global headquarters to Arlington, where its defense leadership is already based. Lockheed Martin Corp., Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and big defense services players such as CACI International Inc. are also based in the D.C. region.</p><p>L3Harris Technologies Inc. is one outlier, based in Melbourne, Fla.</p><p>The sector's concentration in northern Virginia has put defense companies into fierce competition for workers, especially in software and data engineering. Amazon.com Inc. is developing one of its satellite headquarters in Arlington.</p><p>Some defense companies, including Reston, Va.-based Leidos Holdings Inc., have responded by shifting more work outside the area to locales such as St. Louis that also host large government and defense facilities.</p>",
