  "title": "Airbus CEO Jean Pierson Put the Heat on Boeing; Frenchman, who has died at age 80, was an uninhibited salesman as the European aircraft maker caught up with American rivals",
  "text": "<p>Robert Alizart, a former spokesman for Mr. Pierson, confirmed the trousers story.</p><p>By the time Mr. Pierson retired in 1998, Airbus was a strong No. 2 behind Boeing, which had swallowed up the other major player, McDonnell Douglas Corp. \"We are not in this business to be a niche player,\" Mr. Pierson said at a press conference shortly before stepping down. \"We want to be 50-50, which is in fact a polite version to one day being No. 1.\"</p><p>By 2003, Airbus was consistently delivering more jetliners than Boeing. Last year, Airbus delivered more than three times as many jets as Boeing, hobbled by the grounding of its 737 MAX jet. In terms of planes currently flying, Boeing still has the edge in jets over 100 seats and large cargo planes, with 11,494 to Airbus's 9,382, according to aviation-data company Cirium.</p><p>Born Nov. 17, 1940, in Tunisia, Mr. Pierson attended the military academy of La Flèche in France before studying at l'Ecole Nationale Supérieure de l'Aéronautique. He gained early experience as a production engineer at Sud-Aviation, a forerunner of Airbus. In 1972, he joined France's Aérospatiale, where he eventually headed the commercial-aircraft division.</p><p>In March 1985, at age 44, he was a surprise choice to succeed Bernard Lathière, who lost the top job at Airbus amid tensions between its French and German shareholders.</p><p>When Airbus booked its first order in the early 1970s, Boeing officials dismissed their new European rival as a minor nuisance, mainly designed to create jobs in Europe. In 1981, Boeing accounted for nearly seven of every 10 jetliners sold.</p><p>\"We were nowhere,\" recalled Mr. Alizart, the former spokesman for Mr. Pierson. \"We were minnows.\" Mr. Alizart said his boss broadened the company's range of jetliners and proved that Airbus could be relied upon to deliver high quality.</p><p>To crack the U.S. market, Mr. Pierson recruited young native-English speakers, set up a pilot-training center in Florida and hired Alan S. Boyd, a former U.S. transportation secretary, to head Airbus's North American arm. John Leahy, a U.S. citizen, became Airbus's chief salesman. One early blow against Boeing came in 1986 when Northwest Airlines agreed to buy as many as 100 A320 jetliners from Airbus.</p><p>The blunt-speaking Mr. Pierson, who could be gruff and struggled with his weight, was known in the French press as \"the Bear of the Pyrénées,\" a reference to his personality and the mountain range near Airbus's office in Toulouse, France.</p><p>He often challenged American complaints that Airbus's gains were largely due to government subsidies. Boeing, he said, benefited from U.S. military orders. \"The Americans take the position that the Europeans are the black sheep and the Americans the white sheep,\" Mr. Pierson told the New York Times in 1991, \"when the truth is that all the sheep are gray.\"</p><p>He had a vacation home in Corsica, where he enjoyed fishing. That sport, he said, \"teaches you the most important quality for selling aircraft—patience.\"</p><p>Doug Cameron and Daniel Michaels contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to James R.
