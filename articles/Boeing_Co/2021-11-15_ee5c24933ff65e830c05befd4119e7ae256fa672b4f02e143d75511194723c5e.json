  "text": "<p>Despite price pressures that have lingered longer than many investors expected, major indexes are still close to record highs. Companies that have reported earnings so far have broadly beaten analysts' expectations, supporting stock prices. Higher inflation has also suppressed the returns on government bonds, a main alternative to stocks.</p><p>\"People were quite worried about third-quarter earnings, but we've come through it very strongly,\" said Edward Smith, co-chief investment officer at U.K. investment firm Rathbone Investment Management.</p><p>Advance Auto Parts and Lucid Group are slated to post earnings after the market closes.</p><p>Dollar Tree added 8.8% after The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that activist investor Mantle Ridge has a stake of at least $1.8 billion in the discount retailer and plans to push it to act to boost its share price. CyrusOne shares rose 4.2% after the data-center operator said that it is selling itself to investment company KKR &amp; Co. and Global Infrastructure Partners LLC in an all-cash transaction.</p><p>Boeing shares added more than 3% after the company said over the weekend that it had received new orders for its converted freighters.</p><p>In bond markets, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note moved slightly higher to 1.584% from 1.583% Friday. It had traded below 1.56% earlier Monday. Yields rise when prices fall.</p><p>In commodities, Brent crude futures, the global oil market benchmark, fell 1.1% to $81.26 a barrel.</p><p>Overseas, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 edged 0.2% higher. Shares of Royal Dutch Shell rose 1.9% after the oil company said it planned to consolidate its dual British and Dutch structure into a single U.K.-based entity.</p><p>Shares of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria fell more than 4% after the Spanish bank said it would launch a takeover bid for financial-services company Turkiye Garanti Bankasi for the equivalent of around $2.6 billion. The move surprised many investors, given Turkey's rising inflation and weakening currency.</p><p>In Asia, major indexes broadly closed with gains. South Korea's Kospi rose 1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng added almost 0.3% and Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 0.6%. China's Shanghai Composite edged 0.2% lower.</p><p>The Beijing Stock Exchange opened for trading Monday, marking the debut of a venue that China hopes will channel funds into innovative smaller companies. All of the 10 newly listed stocks jumped, triggering temporary trading halts.</p><p>Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com</p><p>Stock Indexes Open Higher While Bond Yields Recover</p>",
