  "text": "<p>And the 11% drop in the Bloomberg U.S. aggregate bond index from its peak is the largest drawdown since the bond bull market began more than 40 years ago. \"Folks, this was a bond crash,\" says Kevin Muir of the Macro Tourist blog. \"There is no other way to describe it.\"</p><p>So the natural discussion after a crash is whether, or when, fortunes will reverse. Lance Roberts, the chief investment strategist of RIA Advisors,is making the case that time is now.</p><p>Roberts argues the U.S. economy is more leveraged than ever, with the average consumer needing $6,400 a year in debt to maintain the current standard of living. \"Such is why, with the heavy requirement of cheap debt to support the standard of living, sharp rate increases have an almost immediate impact on economic activity,\" he says.</p><p>Technically speaking, he adds, the yield on the 10-year Treasury BX:TMUBMUSD10Y is now 4 standard deviations above its 52-week moving average, and near the top of the long-term downtrend channel from 1980.</p><p>Roberts says while yields can temporarily move higher, there's a point where something breaks, which will cause deflationary pressures to reassert themselves. Roberts notes that previous bond bear markets have been met with new highs, in as little as two months.</p><p>\"While buying bonds today may still have some 'pain' in them, we are likely closer to a significant buying opportunity than not,\" he says. \"More important, if we are correct, the coming bull market in bonds will likely outperform stocks and inflation-related trades over the next 12-months.\"</p><p>The buzz</p><p>Microsoft MSFT beat expectations on earningsafter raising prices on its Office suite of products.</p><p>Google owner Alphabet GOOGL reported a rise in profit that missed analyst estimates, as it announced a fresh $70 billion stock buyback plan.</p><p>Wednesday's slate of earnings includes Boeing BA, T Mobile US TMUS, and after the close, Facebook owner Meta Platforms FB and Ford Motor Co.
