  "title": "Argentina Frees Iranian and Venezuelan Crew Members of Plane Detained Since June; Judge ruled there wasn't enough evidence to link them to terrorism, including pilot the U.S. says belongs to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps",
  "text": "<p>The three Iranian and two Venezuelan men left Argentina on Tuesday, according to a spokesman for Argentina's immigration office and a representative for the Iranian crew members. The judge issued the ruling on Friday. Fourteen other crew members were permitted to leave the country in recent weeks.</p><p>Some opposition politicians had accused the crew of using the parts shipments as a cover for an intelligence operation in Argentina.</p><p>Gerardo Milman, an opposition congressman in Argentina and a former government security secretary, had filed a complaint calling for an investigation into whether the jet was transporting equipment for a cyberintelligence base in Argentina.</p><p>Iran's embassy in Argentina didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The Boeing 747, owned by Venezuela state airline Emtrasur, was grounded in June at the Ezeiza International Airport outside Buenos Aires after arriving in Argentina with auto parts from Mexico. The five Iranian men on board had claimed to be training the Venezuelans to fly the jet.</p><p>The plane was unable to refuel in Argentina because of U.S. sanctions, and neighboring Uruguay had denied the crew's request to stop over for refueling there.</p><p>In Argentina, Iranian officials stand accused of carrying out bombings in the 1990s against the Israeli Embassy and a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, killing 114 people.</p><p>The U.S. Justice Department sent a request to Argentine authorities in August to seize the plane, which was previously owned by Mahan Airlines, the private Iranian carrier blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury for alleged arms trafficking.</p><p>The State Department and U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Argentina's grounding of the jet had sparked a backlash from Venezuela's authoritarian regime, which over the years has forged close ties to the Islamic Republic. President Nicol√°s Maduro had demanded the plane be returned to Caracas and accused Washington of trying to steal the aircraft. The plane is still in Argentina.</p><p>The plane and its crew had also drawn attention in Paraguay, where it landed in May to pick up and transport cigarettes to Aruba from a company owned by former Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes. Paraguayan prosecutors opened an investigation into the Iranian and Venezuelan crew, while the U.S. later blacklisted Mr. Cartes for his role in \"significant corruption\" and ties to foreign terrorist organizations. The former president has denied the accusations.</p><p>Argentina Frees Iranian and Venezuelan Crew Members of Plane Detained Since June</p>",
