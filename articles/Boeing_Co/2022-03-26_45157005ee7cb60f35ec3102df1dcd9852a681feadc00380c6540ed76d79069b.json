  "text": "<p>   FORT WORTH, Texas -- A former Boeing pilot's acquittal marks the end of the Justice Department's three-year attempt to hold individuals criminally responsible for a pair of 737 MAX crashes that claimed 346 lives. </p><p>   After deliberating less than two hours Wednesday, a jury found Mark Forkner, who was Boeing Co.'s chief technical pilot during the aircraft's development, not guilty of deceiving a Federal Aviation Administration training official about a flight-control system blamed for sending two jets into fatal nosedives in 2018 and 2019. </p><p>   It was a swift conclusion to a long-running probe by federal agents and prosecutors into what were among history's worst aviation disasters. In addition to the lives lost, the 737 MAX crashes disrupted global aviation, spurred regulatory changes and cost Boeing billions of dollars. </p><p>   Mr. Forkner's acquittal will likely dissuade attempts to hold individuals accountable for aviation disasters, which often involve complex chains of events and multiple mistakes and omissions by different parties, said Kenneth Quinn, former FAA chief counsel who has represented defendants in criminal probes arising from crashes and is a partner at Clyde &amp; Co. \"It really is game over in the United States for federal prosecutors to try to hold individuals criminally responsible for crashes absent demonstrable evidence of intentional conduct,\" Mr. Quinn said. </p><p>   It can be hard to win such convictions, he said, because jurors tend to sympathize with individuals and not companies involved in tragedies. Boeing agreed last year to pay $2.5 billion to resolve a charge that two of its employees misled the FAA. Mr. Forkner was the only employee later indicted. Jurors found him not guilty of four counts of wire fraud. </p><p>   A Justice Department spokesman said pursuing individuals is a priority and prosecutors \"will follow facts of current and future investigations wherever they lead.\" </p><p>   David Gerger, one of Mr. Forkner's attorneys, said justice was done in Fort Worth. \"Juries are smart -- they want to know the whole story,\" he said. \"They figured it out.\" </p><p>   While prosecutors focused on Mr. Forkner, defense attorneys sought to draw jurors' attention to Boeing's engineering errors and missteps by others involved in the 737 MAX's development and certification. They accused the government of making Mr. Forkner a scapegoat. Mr. Forkner was charged with lying to the FAA as a means to defraud Boeing's airline customers. </p><p>   In his role in the 737 MAX's development, Mr. Forkner was in charge of seeking FAA approvals for pilot training materials and requirements. His attorneys reminded jurors that Boeing engineers, not Mr. Forkner, were involved in designing and revising the flight-control system known as MCAS without sufficient safeguards. They said Mr. Forkner was kept in the dark by his Boeing colleagues and didn't lie to the FAA. </p><p>   Prosecutors alleged that Mr. Forkner worked to defraud an FAA official whose approval he sought for lighter 737 MAX training prized by Boeing and airlines that wanted to avoid expensive simulator training for pilots. They argued Mr. Forkner tricked the FAA official into removing mention of MCAS from pilot training materials to make Boeing tens of millions of dollars. </p><p>   Prosecutors urged jurors not to let Mr. Forkner's lawyers distract them. \"They spent their time blaming everyone else,\" prosecutor Cory Jacobs said in his closing arguments Wednesday. </p><p>   While it wasn't mentioned at Mr. Forkner's trial, the absence of MCAS in pilot manuals and training was cited as a contributor to the first 737 MAX crash in late 2018. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor reminded jurors Mr. Forkner wasn't charged with causing any crashes. </p><p></p>",
