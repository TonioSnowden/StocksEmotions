  "title": "Jeff Koons Launches A Moonshot --- Artists are racing to exhibit works on lunar surface",
  "text": "<p>To succeed, he will need to rocket ahead of rivals including Sacha Jafri, a London-based painter who gained fame last month for creating the world's largest painting and is now seeking to install his own art on the moon.</p><p>As a prelude to its plan to return U.S. astronauts to the moon's surface for the first time since 1972, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has asked several space-robotics companies to design their own pod-like lunar landers to ferry scientific instruments and gear to the surface without a crew. At least two also plan to send up art, though it's unclear which one will be ready first.</p><p>The lander with Mr. Koons's art is hitching a ride aboard a Falcon 9 rocket provided by Elon Musk's SpaceX, while Mr. Jafri's project will fly on a Vulcan Centaur rocket designed by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co.</p><p>The artist who wins won't be able to claim full pioneer status. A postage-stamp-size ceramic tile etched with drawings by contemporary artists Robert Rauschenberg, John Chamberlain, Claes Oldenburg, Forrest Myers, David Novros and Andy Warhol is believed to have been smuggled aboard the second human moon flight, Apollo 12, according to Carolyn Russo, a curator of art at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.</p><p>But nobody can prove that the piece, known as \"Moon Museum,\" actually made it to the surface: It is supposedly stuck to a leg of the lunar module that remained behind, and nobody has since paid it a visit.</p><p>Mr. Koons's \"Moon Phases,\" by contrast, is meant to attract a wide audience -- and wealthy collectors. Speaking in detail about his project for the first time, Mr. Koons said it centers on 125 miniature moons he created to illustrate how sun and shadow appear to carve the moon into phases, from full to eclipsed. He lined up these nearly weightless plastic orbs into a clear, heat-resistant cube that will be attached to the lunar vehicle.</p><p>Nearby cameras will photograph the cube after the lander touches down on Oceanus Procellarum, a vast area on the visible side of the moon. The resulting photos will be minted as Mr. Koons's first NFTs, or nonfungible tokens that serve as digital proofs of purchase for items like art. A hundred will be sold, with the first set of around 15 versions priced at $2 million apiece. Later versions may be priced higher.</p><p>Each NFT holder will be able to claim long-distance ownership of one of the miniature moons in the cube on the lander, though individual elements can never be removed, the artist said. Buyers will also each get an encased metal-alloy moon about the size of a basketball that they can display on Earth, the artist said.</p><p>A gemstone will also be added to these moon sculptures to pinpoint the lander's exact locale.</p><p>\"I was 14 when we first walked on the moon,\" Mr. Koons said. He said he has been enamored ever since, noting that he's used spherical shapes often.</p><p>This time around, Mr. Koons assigned the name of a famous historical person to each of moon phase, from Plato to Picasso, to honor mankind's accomplishments.</p><p>\"I want this work to deal with my history but also applaud humanity's aspirations,\" he said, adding that giving each moon phase a nameplate will lend the project a trophy feel. \"The word trophy represents an award you give for transcending and getting better, so in that sense trophy art is fantastic.\"</p><p>Because of the moon's extreme temperatures, the lander's cameras and other equipment will shut down after two weeks. Mr. Koons's piece will remain in perpetuity, according to Jack Fischer, a retired astronaut overseeing the Intuitive Machines lander program set to carry Mr. Koons's art.</p><p>Mr. Koons said he has been reassured that his piece will launch ahead of any rivals. \"I'm trying to stay philosophical about it,\" he said, \"but if my work turns out to be the first, that's fantastic.\"</p><p>Mr. Jafri said he's equally up to the task. Last month, the swirling abstract painter made headlines after he raised $62 million for charitable causes by selling what has been described as the world's biggest painting, spanning an area at least as big as three basketball courts. He has also been working on a project to place a nearly 10-inch-wide metal-alloy plate on the moon.</p><p>The plate has been engraved with an embracing couple and 88 hearts. He said his piece, \"We Rise Together -- with the Light of the Moon,\" has secured space aboard a lunar-landing vehicle designed by Astrobotic Technology Inc.</p><p>Mr. Jafri said a prospective buyer has pledged roughly $75 million to buy his engraved plate. It will be dropped onto the lunar surface by way of a robotic armature, to be left there. The artist will then make and mint 20,000 NFTs to be sold later to raise charitable funds.</p><p>\"No way he will beat us,\" Mr. Jafri said of Mr. Koons.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
