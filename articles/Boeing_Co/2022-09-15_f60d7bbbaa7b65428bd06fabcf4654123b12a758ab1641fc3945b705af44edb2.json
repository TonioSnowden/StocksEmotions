  "title": "PERSONAL JOURNAL  ---  Carry On:  Stow Your Suitcase  On Its Side, Like a Taco  ---  Newer overhead bins now hold more -- if fliers get with the program  ----  By Dawn Gilbertson",
  "text": "<p>   Squeezing everything into a carry-on bag is challenging enough. All that work goes out the window if there isn't enough room for your bag in the overhead bin. </p><p>   Airlines and airplane manufacturers have invested vast sums designing bins that fit more bags. But they're running into a problem: Some passengers can't figure out how to use them. Flight attendants are spending extra time rearranging bags before departure and repeatedly making announcements about how to stow them correctly. </p><p>   A growing number of planes have larger, drop-down bins, which fit one to two more bags each and reduce the number of gate-checked bags. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines have them on more than 80% of their planes excluding regional jets and United Airlines says the majority of its fleet will have them by 2025. Southwest Airlines, a major holdout, will join the club next year. American says it has seen a 30% decline in gate-checked bags since introducing the bigger bins. </p><p>   That's great for passengers who dread having their carry-on bag snatched by an airline employee at the last minute, forcing a time-sucking trip to baggage claim. But the new bin math only works if bags are placed a certain way, and the new way of doing it is another snarl in an already stressful travel journey. </p><p>   The bags should be stowed on their side, not flat, as is the norm with older bins. </p><p>   Major U.S. airlines have plastered stickers in the back of the new bins depicting the proper position. Flight attendants on many airlines make repeated announcements about turning the bags onto their side, sometimes comparing the ideal bin layout to a plate of tacos. United created a TikTok. </p><p>   Yet passengers still aren't getting it, at least initially. I watched Delta flight attendants repeatedly flip bags onto their side on two domestic flights outfitted with the bigger bins on Saturday. </p><p>   \"There is definitely a learning curve, especially for our less-frequent travelers,\" says Susannah Carr, a flight attendant for a major U.S. airline.Ms. Carr says some passengers give her funny looks when she turns bags onto their side or urges them to do so. </p><p>   \"It's not going to close,\" they say. \"That's not how bags fit in the overhead bins.\" </p><p>   \"I promise you it will close,\" she replies. \"Trust the process.\" </p><p>   Confusion also stems from airlines' instructions. A flight attendant on one of the Delta flights on Saturday told me putting a bag on its side means different things to different passengers. Sometimes passengers are told to stow their carry-on like a book, but that doesn't always register either. </p><p>   \"Some people stack their books,\" she said. </p><p>   And then there's the matter of e-readers. </p><p>   \"If you're over 23, a book makes a lot of sense,\" says Matthew Coder, in-flight experience program manager for Alaska Airlines. \"If you are just a Kindle reader, you might not know what we're talking about.\" </p><p>   Alaska Airlines was the first customer for Boeing's new Space Bins in 2015 and settled on books as the best description. </p><p>   \"It's the quickest thing we could think of to kind of automatically give people the advice on how to take a flat bag and tip it up,\" Mr. Coder says. \"If there's a better term out there that resonates with more people across all age groups, we're hoping to hear that and we can start using it.\" </p><p>   Alaska also informally relies on its frequent fliers to set the standard for other passengers. </p><p>   \"They're doing a lot of the education for us, because they board early, they're tipping up their bags,\" he says. \"And then others get on board, see those examples and tip them up.\" </p><p>   Still, several years in, the airline still has to remind passengers about proper stowage. </p><p>   Angela Harren, a 39-year-old marketing specialist in Minnesota, says she giggled every time the flight attendant on her Delta flight from Washington, D.C., to Minneapolis in late August described how to stow carry-on bags in the larger bins so everyone's bag would fit. </p><p>   The announcement: \"The overhead bins are equipped so you can put your suitcases in there upright like a taco, not flat like a hamburger.\" </p><p>   Ms. Harren didn't bring a roller bag on her trip to D.C., but says the announcement got her attention. The first time she encountered the bigger bins, on a flight to San Francisco in June, she just copied other passengers and stowed her bag on its side. Plenty of others didn't get the memo. </p><p>   \"People were fumbling,\" she says. </p><p>   Ms. Carr, the flight attendant, thinks passengers will catch on as the bigger bins become more universal. Aircraft manufacturer Airbus says 70% of customers ordering new Airbus A320s are opting for its bigger Airspace XL bins. </p><p>   \"I have complete empathy when people get a little confused with the overhead bins,\" she says. \"From one plane to the next, it changes.\" </p><p></p>",
