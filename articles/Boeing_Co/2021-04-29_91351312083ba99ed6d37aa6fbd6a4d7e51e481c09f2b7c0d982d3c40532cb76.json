  "title": "Boeing Posts Loss Amid Slow Travel",
  "text": "<p>The patchy recovery of global air travel remains the biggest issue for Boeing and its huge supply chain, with domestic markets in the U.S. and some parts of Asia recovering to pre-pandemic levels while Europe and long-haul travel struggle.</p><p>\"I'm quite confident that recovery in this country is coming, and it's probably coming sooner than most anywhere with the exception of China,\" Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said Wednesday. \"But when you look broadly around the world, it's not quite as robust.\"</p><p>On Wednesday, Boeing shares fell $7.01, or 2.9%, to $235.46.</p><p>Aircraft deliveries were starting to increase before Boeing halted 737 MAX shipments this month to address a recently discovered electrical issue. Mr. Calhoun said potential near-term production increases would in part hinge on relations with China. The country has yet to follow the U.S. and other regulators in recertifying the 737 MAX to resume passenger service. Regulators had grounded the aircraft after two fatal crashes in late 2018 and early 2019.</p><p>\"We have great relationships in China,\" Mr. Calhoun said. \"But we need to get the order stream going again.\"</p><p>The limited resumption of 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner jet deliveries against a background of quality issues contributed to sales of $15.2 billion in the first quarter, down 10% from a year earlier. Boeing reported a loss of $561 million compared with a $641 million deficit a year earlier.</p><p>Boeing took a $318 million charge on its work converting two 747-8 jets to serve as the future Air Force One, citing pandemic-related delays as well as a dispute with a supplier. The company is contracted to deliver two converted 747-8 jumbo jets in 2024, but has been forced to switch suppliers for some interior work on the planes.</p><p>The Air Force said Boeing had proposed a new schedule for the jets. \"The Air Force is analyzing this schedule before taking any formal contractual or program actions,\" said a spokeswoman.</p><p>The two planes once destined for a now-defunct Russian airline are being converted by Boeing with new interiors, communications systems and defensive systems. The $3.9 billion contract was awarded after a long standoff over the price with former President Donald Trump.</p><p>Boeing took a charge last year on the program and then became involved in a dispute with GDC Technics LLC, which was working on some of the interior refits. The firm filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week after Boeing canceled its contract citing performance issues, and subsequently countersued the plane maker, according to court records.</p><p>It is the latest drag from a defense unit that Boeing is relying on to carry it through to a recovery in commercial airline traffic.</p><p>Boeing has been grappling with commercial jet production issues in recent months. It halted 787 deliveries for five months to resolve manufacturing problems. Earlier this month, it recommended that airlines ground 106 MAX jets to resolve the electrical issue, which stems from a change in its assembly process.</p><p>Boeing's 737 MAX deliveries will be \"very light\" in April, Mr. Calhoun said, while the company will catch up handing over the jets to customers over the rest of the year.</p><p>Mr. Calhoun said Boeing has made progress overhauling how it approaches design, engineering and quality while facing production problems over the past year. The Dreamliner delivery halt, for example, was part of an effort to \"stop things when we see an issue and get them fixed once and for all.\"</p><p>While the company's internal changes may not entirely prevent problems in the future, Mr. Calhoun said: \"We're going to be a whole lot better.\"</p><p>The per-share loss of 92 cents in the quarter ended March 31 was just ahead of the 98-cent consensus among analysts polled by FactSet. The company burned through $3.4 billion of cash in the quarter.</p>",
