Walmart's WMT profit warning helped set the tone for a down day on Wall Street.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>The Fed decision is due at 2 p.m. Eastern, with a press conference from Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. Expectations are for a 75 basis point interest rate hike, but there's uncertainty on what the Fed's message will be, and whether it lines up a policy pivot after a string of negative economic surveys from both companies and consumers.</p><p>Tim Duy, chief U.S. economist at SGH Macro Advisors, says the central bank will want to send a hawkish message but might find it hard to accomplish.</p><p>\"The easy path to sending that message is to set up another 75bp hike in September, but I don't think the Fed will do that if, as I suspect, the goal is to reduce the level of guidance while creating a hawkish path that does not require an additional super-sized hike,\" said Duy. \"It might be a tricky space to navigate; we have always said the Fed will face a communications challenge when it comes time to set the stage for stepping down from 75 bp.\"</p><p>Meanwhile investors are digesting second quarter earnings reports. More than 150 S&amp;P 500 companies have reported calendar second-quarter earnings thus far. Of those names, roughly 70% have beaten analyst expectations, FactSet data shows.</p><p>Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT each missed earnings expectations in their reports Tuesday night, though shares of both were up on the market open Wednesday as they both posted quarterly revenue growth. Among the wave of companies reporting results on Wednesday are plane maker Boeing BA and, after the market close, Facebook parent company Meta Platforms META META.</p><p>\"Solid reports from tech giants Microsoft and Alphabet have given a fresh boost to market sentiment on Wednesday, sparking hopes that companies can handle tighter monetary conditions and a slower economy,\" said Pierre Veyret, technical analyst at ActivTrades.</p><p>See: Google and Microsoft earnings show the bar has been lowered for Big Tech</p><p>Also in Washington, the Senate is expected to vote on a bill to boost U.S. semiconductor production.</p><p>In U.S. economic data, durable-goods orders jumped 1.9% in June. That was largely due to more bookings for new cars and trucks, but there were hints of weakness among other manufacturers. Economists polled by the Wall Street Journal had forecast a 0.4% decline in new orders for products meant to last at least three years.</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Boeing Co. BA stock rose 2.8% Wednesday, after the aerospace and defense company reported a wider-than-expected second-quarter loss and missed on revenue, but beat free cash flow (FCF) forecasts by a wide margin.</p><p>* Visa Inc V's shares dropped 1.1% Wednesday, despite that the company topped expectations with its latest results Tuesday and gave an upbeat signal to investors about the resilience of spending volumes in the current macroeconomic climate.</p><p>* Kraft Heinz Co.
