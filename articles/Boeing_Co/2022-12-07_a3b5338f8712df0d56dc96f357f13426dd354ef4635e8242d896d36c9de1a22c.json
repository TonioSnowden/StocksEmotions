  "title": "Jeff Bezos's Space Company Bids Again for NASA Moon Lander, After SpaceX Win; A team including Blue Origin, Boeing and Lockheed Martin wants to build a craft to transport astronauts to the moon",
  "text": "<p>Last year, NASA awarded SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract to use a version of the Elon Musk-led company's planned Starship vehicle to handle that task, on a mission currently set for 2025.</p><p>NASA's decision to issue a single contract for that lander drew a protest and a lawsuit from Blue Origin, both of which were unsuccessful. It also prompted Mr. Bezos to write a letter to NASA's administrator, Bill Nelson. \"Instead of investing in two competing lunar landers as originally intended, the agency chose to confer a multiyear, multibillion-dollar head start to SpaceX,\" his letter from July of last year said.</p><p>Mr. Bezos offered to cut the price for its lander bid by waiving payments to Blue Origin and have the company conduct and pay for a test mission. NASA officials weren't immediately swayed, but facing pressure from Congress, the agency later agreed to seek proposals from companies other than SpaceX for a second lander.</p><p>NASA also agreed to award SpaceX additional work using its Starship lander. The agency recently tasked the company with handling another moon landing in 2027.</p><p>NASA needs landers to take astronauts from its Orion spacecraft in lunar orbit to the surface of the moon and back, where they would re-enter Orion for a trip back to Earth. The agency launched the first Artemis mission last month, and the uncrewed Orion vehicle used for that flight is expected to return to Earth next Sunday.</p><p>Blue Origin and its partners are likely to face competition to win the deal to deliver the second lander. An executive at a division of Leidos Holdings Inc. said at a recent investor meeting that the company planned to submit its own bid. NASA usually makes the names of bidders available after an award and protest period, an agency spokeswoman said.</p><p>â€”Doug Cameron contributed to this article</p><p>Write to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com</p><p>Jeff Bezos's Space Company Bids Again for NASA Moon Lander, After SpaceX Win</p>",
