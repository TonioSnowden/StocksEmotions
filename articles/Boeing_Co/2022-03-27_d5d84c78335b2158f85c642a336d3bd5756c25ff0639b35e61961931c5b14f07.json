  "title": "Second Black Box Found at China Eastern Plane Crash Site; The flight data recorder was buried almost 5 feet underground, roughly 130 feet from where plane made impact",
  "text": "<p>Rescuers had located the first black box, the cockpit voice recorder, on Wednesday, but authorities said they hadn't been able to detect the positioning signal of the second box and speculated its signal transmitter may have been damaged in the crash.</p><p>The discovery of the black boxes—both of which are actually painted orange to make them easier to spot—is a critical moment in the aftermath of a plane crash, as they store vital information and typically provide accident investigators the best information about what caused a plane to go down.</p><p>The flight-data recorder tracks more than 1,000 flight details, such as airspeed and altitude, the status of smoke alarms and the position of the wing flaps.</p><p>Both boxes were found less than a week after the March 21 incident, in which a Boeing 737 carrying 132 people took a sudden nosedive and crashed into a mountainside in southern China's Guangxi region. All 132 people on board have been confirmed dead, the Chinese civil aviation regulator said on Saturday, making it China's deadliest plane crash since 1994.</p><p>The force of the impact scattered debris over a wide area. According to the CCTV report, firefighters from Guangxi were digging near the site of the crash on Sunday morning when they discovered an orange-colored object in the soil.</p><p>\"We were given orders to search in this area, and we were digging around the area at around 9.20 a.m. when we saw a circular object,\" a firefighter surnamed Chen told the broadcaster. \"We thought it looked like (the black box) and immediately called a local civil aviation engineer to come to the scene.\"</p><p>The exterior of the black box was in good condition, the broadcaster reported.</p><p>State television footage showed people in hazmat suits and black knee-high rubber boots clambering on a steep slope of torn-up red soil where the box was discovered. One of the plane's emergency locator transmitters, a device that was installed close to the second black box, had been unearthed nearby before Sunday's find, according to CCTV.</p><p>Aviation experts have been puzzled by the crash, which involved one of one of the fastest descents of a commercial aviation jetliner in history. The China Eastern flight MU 5735 had taken off from Kunming airport in the southern Chinese province of Yunnan and had flown for more than an hour without any issue, before nosediving and plunging almost 22,000 feet in 72 seconds.</p><p>A senior official with the Shanghai-based airline said earlier this week that the plane was in good working order and the crew was qualified and in good health at the time of departure. China's aviation regulator is leading the investigation, and the National Transportation Safety Board has appointed a senior air-safety investigator as a U.S. representative, the NTSB has said.</p><p>Qianwei Zhang contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Liza Lin at Liza.Lin@wsj.com</p><p>Second Black Box Found at China Eastern Plane Crash Site</p>",
