  "text": "<p>   WASHINGTON -- The Biden administration says it won't be ending tariffs on imported European wine, cheese and other food imports anytime soon -- to the dismay of industry groups who say the levies are hurting U.S. restaurants and consumers. </p><p>   The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Friday it is unnecessary for now to suspend the levies, which were imposed by the Trump administration as part of a longstanding dispute with the European Union about commercial-aircraft subsidies. </p><p>   In a regulatory filing, the USTR said it would \"continue to consider the action taken in the investigation,\" referring to a 17-year dispute about how governments subsidize Boeing Co. and Airbus SE.The Biden administration has said it is reviewing the tariffs and other major trade-policy actions adopted by the previous administration. </p><p>   Under the Trump administration, the dispute turned into a tariff fight that snared food and beverage industries unrelated to aircraft manufacturing. Washington imposed tariffs on $7.5 billion worth of European wine and food items such as cheese and olives in late 2019. </p><p>   The European Union hit back with levies on U.S. whiskey, nuts and tobacco valued about $4.5 billion. The U.S. stepped up the sanctions on Dec. 31 with additional tariffs, placing virtually all wine imports from France and Germany under its 25% tariff. </p><p>   The decision to maintain the status quo came despite intense lobbying by the U.S. restaurant and beverage industries that are reeling from the impact of the pandemic. </p><p>   \"These food and wine tariffs are impacting one of the most vulnerable sections of the economy at the worst point in generations,\" said Ben Aneff, president of the U.S. Wine Trade Alliance, a group representing wine importers. </p><p></p>",
