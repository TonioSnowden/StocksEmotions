  "title": "World News: No Survivors Found at China Plane Crash --- Investigators want to learn why jet with 132 on board plummeted so quickly from sky",
  "text": "<p>Scraps and broken components from the plane lay scattered on dirt paths and amid fallen branches, according to a video by the Chinese Communist Party's flagship publication, People's Daily. China's state broadcaster streamed footage online Tuesday night that showed People's Liberation Army soldiers digging up plane debris that had wiped out trees and stands of bamboo before becoming lodged deep in the earth by the force of impact.</p><p>A spokesman for China's airline regulator, the Civil Aviation Administration of China, told reporters at the press briefing that air-traffic controllers tried several times to hail the jet after they saw its altitude drop sharply but got no response.</p><p>The spokesman, Zhu Tao, said the plane was at a cruise altitude of 8,900 meters, or about 29,000 feet, at 2:17 p.m. local time Monday and that a controller noticed a sharp drop at 2:20 p.m. At 2:23 p.m., the radar signal of the aircraft disappeared, he said.</p><p>\"With the information we currently have, we have no way of coming to a clear view of the reasons,\" Mr. Zhu said, confirming earlier state-media reports that no survivors had been found.</p><p>If all 132 people on board Monday's flight died, it would be China's deadliest air crash in almost three decades.</p><p>Mr. Zhu's account is in line with flight-tracking data that showed the Boeing Co. 737-800 flying from Kunming to the southern metropolis of Guangzhou was at cruising altitude on Monday before nosediving at 2:20 p.m. local time, a trajectory some air safety experts said was extremely unusual. The plane was transporting nine crew members and 123 passengers.</p><p>The plane wreckage was strewn across a forested mountainous area in the Guangxi region, which makes the search for the aircraft's black box more difficult, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing rescuers. Investigators typically analyze the plane's flight-data recorder and cockpit voice recorder to help gain insight into a flight's final moments</p><p>One question for investigators is why the jet plummeted so quickly from the sky, reaching vertical speeds of 31,000 feet a minute, or more than 350 miles an hour. It initially fell to an altitude of 7,425 feet and briefly managed to gain about 1,200 feet in altitude before again diving toward the mountain, data from aircraft-tracking service Flightradar24 show. The aircraft stopped transmitting at 3,225 feet.</p><p>The plane \"met airworthiness requirements before takeoff, its technical condition was stable, and the nine aircrew members on the flight were in good health conditions and their experience in flying meets official requirements,\" Sun Shiying, chairman of China Eastern's subsidiary branch based in southwestern China's Yunnan province, said at the press briefing Tuesday night.</p><p>China's Vice Premier Liu He and an official in Beijing's cabinet led a team to Wuzhou, a city in Guangxi near the crash site, on Monday night to oversee the rescue efforts and investigation, Xinhua reported.</p><p>Preliminary findings showed no foreign nationals were on the plane, said Wang Wenbin, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman.</p><p>---</p><p>Qianwei Zhang and Rachel Liang contributed to this article.</p>",
