  "title": "Technology:  Bezos Bids Again  For Moon Lander  ----  By Micah Maidenberg",
  "text": "<p>   Jeff Bezos's space company said it is making another run at the moon, after NASA chose rival SpaceX to handle a high-profile lunar mission last year. </p><p>   Blue Origin LLC, the space company Mr. Bezos founded and has backed, said Tuesday in a tweet that it is part of a group that submitted a bid to develop a lunar lander capable of transporting NASA astronauts to the surface of the moon on future missions for Artemis, the agency's space-exploration program. Blue Origin's partners on its bid include Lockheed Martin Corp. and Boeing Co. </p><p>   Last year, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration awarded SpaceX, known formally as Space Exploration Technologies Corp., a $2.9 billion contract to use a version of the Elon Musk-led company's planned Starship vehicle to handle that task, on a mission set for 2025. </p><p>   NASA's decision to issue a single contract for that lander drew a protest and a lawsuit from Blue Origin, both of which were unsuccessful. It also prompted Mr. Bezos to write a letter to NASA's administrator, Bill Nelson. \"Instead of investing in two competing lunar landers as originally intended, the agency chose to confer a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar head start to SpaceX,\" his letter from July of last year said. </p><p>   NASA also agreed to award SpaceX additional work using its Starship lander. The agency recently tasked the company with handling another moon landing in 2027. </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Doug Cameron contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
