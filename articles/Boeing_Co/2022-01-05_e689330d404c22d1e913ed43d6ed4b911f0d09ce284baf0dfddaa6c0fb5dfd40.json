  "title": "Navy Radar Training Launched a Career in Computer Science; Bruce W. Arden, who has died at age 94, made mainframes more accessible and used them to calculate missile trajectories",
  "text": "<p>Later, at the University of Michigan, he used a mainframe computer to calculate trajectories for Boeing missiles. He also helped the university find more efficient ways for researchers to write programs and share processing and memory resources on a mainframe. In 1959, with two colleagues, he created the Michigan Algorithm Decoder, used to convert language that makes sense to people into instructions that a computer can read.</p><p>\"My efforts were mainly to make programming more available to nonspecialists,\" he wrote.</p><p>He chaired computer-science departments at the University of Michigan and Princeton University, and was a dean at the University of Rochester. Among his students at Princeton was Eric Schmidt, later chief executive of Google, who described the professor as \"one of the founders of computer science.\"</p><p>Dr. Arden died Dec. 8 in Livonia, Mich. He was 94.</p><p>Bruce Wesley Arden was born May 29, 1927, in Minneapolis. His father, John Wesley Arden, was an accountant who later worked for International Business Machines Corp. and other companies. (The elder Mr. Arden had concluded there were too many John Andersons in Swedish-American communities and changed the family name to Arden.)</p><p>Bruce Arden's mother, Clare Newton Arden, who grew up partly on China's Hainan Island as the daughter of a Presbyterian missionary, was a science teacher and aspiring novelist. She chafed at traditional notions that wives should devote their lives to household duties. When Bruce was around 5, she was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, subjected to a prefrontal lobotomy and confined to mental institutions.</p><p>Bruce and an older brother were \"farmed out,\" as he put itâ€”sent to live with relatives on a farm near Salina, Kan. There he encountered dust storms, swarming grasshoppers and a weekly bathing ritual involving shared water in a metal tub on the kitchen floor. The water in his bedroom wash basin sometimes froze overnight.</p><p>Each evening, with the aid of a kerosene lamp, his great grandfather read passages from the Bible out loud, in Swedish.</p><p>Overall, it was a 19th century existence, Dr. Arden recalled.</p><p>When he was 8, he and his brother were put on a train and sent to live with their father and his new wife in Bloomfield, N.J. The family also lived in Upper Darby, Pa., and Wilmington, Del., while Bruce was growing up. He fondly recalled a female teacher who \"made Caesar's wars come alive by standing on the desk with helmet, short sword and shield while fighting off the barbarians in Latin.\"</p><p>Eager for adventures of his own, he signed up for a Navy program providing training in radar technology, which he completed as World War II was ending. The Navy deployed him to an outpost on Alaska's Kodiak Island, where the postwar perils included bears and a dearth of human company.</p><p>After his discharge from the Navy in 1946, the GI Bill helped pay for his studies at Purdue University, where he earned a degree in electrical engineering. He met Patricia Ann Joy, a pianist, and they married in 1951.</p><p>A job at a University of Michigan research center, where a mainframe computer was being designed and built, put him in the vanguard of the digital age. While working for the university, he earned a master's degree in math and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering.</p><p>In the late 1950s, he developed the Michigan Algorithm Decoder along with Robert M. Graham and Bernard Galler. The decoder was known as MAD, and the cover of an early manual mimicked the look of another MAD, the humor magazine. The decoder was used for decades, until personal computers supplanted mainframes for most tasks.</p><p>In the early 1960s, before computer science was established as a focus of university studies, Dr. Arden wrote a textbook, \"An Introduction to Digital Computing.\"</p><p>In the late 1960s, he chaired a National Academy of Sciences committee charged with reviewing computer technology supporting the U.S. antiballistic missile system. He wasn't certain that computers were capable of identifying all dangerous objects hurtling toward the nation. \"It is possible to believe that it didn't make any difference if the ABM defense worked, as long as the other side believed it might,\" he wrote later.</p><p>Near the end of his career, when he was in his late 60s, Dr. Arden was still commuting more than 7 miles to work by bicycle.</p><p>His wife, Patricia Arden, died in 2003.</p><p>Though he had devoted his career to exploring new uses for computers, Dr. Arden was skeptical of internet matchmaking services. His daughter, Michelle Arden, persuaded him to try one. As a result, he met Peggy Greif. They married at the end of 2004.</p><p>She survives him, along with his daughter, a son, Wayne Arden, and two grandchildren.</p><p>Write to James R.
