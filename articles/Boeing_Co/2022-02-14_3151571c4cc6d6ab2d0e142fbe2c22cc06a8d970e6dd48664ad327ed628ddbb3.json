  "title": "Lockheed Martin Scraps Aerojet Rocketdyne Deal; Defense merger canceled after antitrust concerns over space and missile suppliers",
  "text": "<p>Antitrust authorities cleared a similar defense industry deal in 2017 involving two other military contractors, but the FTC has since taken a tougher stance on so-called transactions involving vertical integration of companies and their suppliers.</p><p>\"Our planned acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne would have benefitted the entire industry through greater efficiency, speed, and significant cost reductions for the U.S. government,\" Lockheed Martin Chief Executive Jim Taiclet said.</p><p>El Segundo, Calif.-based Aerojet is the only large, independent U.S. producer of engines for rockets and missiles. The FTC alleged that allowing Lockheed to buy Aerojet would give the defense giant the ability to deny other defense contractors access to critical components needed to build competing missiles and space systems.</p><p>The challenge to Lockheed Martin's planned deal triggered a battle at Aerojet Rocketdyne, including a proposed proxy fight involving parties linked to its chairman, Warren Lichtenstein, which have proposed a new slate of directors. Aerojet also announced an internal investigation into Mr. Lichtenstein earlier this month, though the company said it wasn't related to finance or operations. Mr. Lichtenstein didn't respond to a request for comment at the time.</p><p>Lockheed Martin agreed to buy Aerojet in December 2020, but has faced opposition from some defense contractors concerned about the future availability of the rocket motors. The companies had offered a series of guarantees to continue supplying Aerojet equipment to other defense contractors, but said these were deemed insufficient by the FTC.</p><p>The commission argued the deal would harm rival defense contractors and lead to unacceptable consolidation in markets critical to national security and defense.</p><p>Aerojet makes rocket boosters for missile-defense systems such as Lockheed's own Thaad program. Aerojet also works on programs such as the replacement of land-based nuclear missiles led by Northrop Grumman Corp., and the Boeing Co.-led Commercial Crew space taxi and Space Launch System rocket.</p><p>Northrop Grumman's 2017 acquisition of Orbital ATK Inc., a provider of space and missile propulsion systems, had made Aerojet a potential target for Lockheed Martin or Boeing, which are partners in the United Launch Alliance space joint venture, according to analysts. Aerojet could still attract interest from private-equity firms and smaller defense companies, said analysts.</p><p>The Orbital ATK deal was approved with conditions by antitrust enforcers. U.S. defense-sector consolidation has continued in recent years, especially among companies that provide services rather than hardware.</p><p>Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com</p><p>Lockheed Martin Scraps Aerojet Rocketdyne Deal</p>",
