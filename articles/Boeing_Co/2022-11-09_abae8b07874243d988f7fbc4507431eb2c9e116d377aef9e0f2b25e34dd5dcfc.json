  "text": "<p>    Flying from Ohio to Florida aboard his remodeled Boeing 757, Donald Trump caught a glimpse of himself on television. \"A fine looking young man, a fine looking candidate,\" he quipped to a handful of reporters. </p><p>   Then he saw another potential 2024 presidential contender. \"There's our competitor, he's a fine guy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday night. </p><p>   He was talking about Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who cruised to re-election Tuesday, a victory that will ratchet up talk of a Trump-DeSantis rivalry, which had been at a low boil. On Saturday in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump rapped him as \"Ron DeSanctimonious\" though he didn't use the nickname the following day in Miami or at the final rally Monday near Dayton, Ohio. </p><p>   \"I don't know that he's running,\" Mr. Trump said of the 2024 presidential race. \"I think if he runs he could hurt himself very badly.\" </p><p>   Mr. Trump remains the party's heavyweight but Mr. DeSantis has built a national reputation and fundraising juggernaut. \"I think he would be making a mistake,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think the base would not like it.\" </p><p>   Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday outside a polling location in Palm Beach that he voted for the governor. </p><p>   Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. DeSantis in his 2018 run for governor, lifting the tea party-styled congressman in a Republican primary over establishment favorite Adam Putnam. </p><p>   \"If he runs, he runs,\" Mr. Trump said. But he added: \"If he did run, I will tell you things about him that won't be very flattering. I know more about him than anybody other than perhaps his wife, who is really running his campaign.\" </p><p></p>",
