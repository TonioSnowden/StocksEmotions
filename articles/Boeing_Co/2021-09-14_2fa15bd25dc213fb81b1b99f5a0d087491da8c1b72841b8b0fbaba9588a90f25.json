  "text": "<p>\"The court could not have meant to make findings that adopt plaintiffs' view of the case at this early stage of litigation without access to the complete record of transcripts and testimony that will tell the full story,\" the defense lawyers wrote.</p><p>They said the judge's ruling went further than it needed in establishing that the plaintiffs had met certain legal thresholds to proceed.</p><p>Two of Boeing's 737 MAX jets crashed in late 2018 and early 2019, claiming 346 lives. Two Boeing shareholders are suing the company's board, alleging directors failed to sufficiently properly monitor safety matters during the aircraft's development and in the aftermath of the fatal accidents.</p><p>Boeing's Forecast</p><p>* Boeing Raises Outlook on Travel Rebound</p><p>The ruling earlier this month, by Vice Chancellor Morgan Zurn of Delaware's Court of Chancery, let the shareholders' lawsuit proceed, allowing it to overcome Boeing's attempt to dismiss it.</p><p>Her ruling said the board \"publicly lied about if and how it monitored the 737 MAX's safety.\"</p><p>The ruling cited 2019 newspaper interviews that Mr. Calhoun gave when he was the board's lead director. Mr. Calhoun became CEO of Boeing in January 2020. In their motion, the defense lawyers say the plaintiffs mischaracterized Mr. Calhoun's comments.</p><p>Boeing declined to comment Tuesday. The defense lawyers said in their court filing that the complete record will eventually show Boeing's board conducted extensive safety oversight in good faith.</p><p>Plaintiffs have gained access under Delaware law to more than 630,000 pages of internal board documents, including emails and meeting minutes but haven't taken depositions or sought other documents as part of typical legal discovery.</p><p>Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing CEO, Board Ask Judge to Clarify Ruling</p>",
