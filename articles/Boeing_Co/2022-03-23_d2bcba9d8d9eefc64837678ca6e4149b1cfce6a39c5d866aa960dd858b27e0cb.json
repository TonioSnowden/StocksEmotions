  "title": "Human Remains Found at China Eastern Airlines Plane Crash Site; Rainfall in the mountainous terrain leads to suspension of rescue efforts",
  "text": "<p>On Wednesday, the rain soaked the crash site, forcing rescuers to suspend their effort, CCTV reported, adding that the smell of fuel still lingered at the scene. The broadcaster said rescuers warned the rain could cause small-scale landslides.</p><p>The plane, operated by China Eastern Airlines, was carrying nine crew members and 123 passengers when it plunged to the ground on Monday. With no survivors found, it could be China's worst plane crash in almost three decades.</p><p>Ou Ling, a fire department official in Wuzhou, a city in the Guangxi region near the crash site, told CCTV on Tuesday that human remains have been found. Details about any recovery of bodies remained scarce in Chinese media.</p><p>Mr. Ou said the narrow paths to the crash site have prevented larger rescue equipment from entering, adding that the lack of lighting facilities in the mountains—especially at night—has complicated their mission, according to state media.</p><p>A spokesman for China's airline regulator, Zhu Tao, said at a briefing late Tuesday that the severely damaged jet has made the investigation difficult and the cause of the crash couldn't yet be determined.</p><p>Along with the search for the missing passengers, another critical mission is the hunt for the plane's two so-called black boxes. Investigators typically analyze the plane's flight-data recorder and cockpit voice recorder to help gain insight into a flight's final moments, though crash investigations can often take months or years.</p><p>The plane, a Boeing Co. 737-800, was suitable for flying and reported no technical issues before takeoff and its aircrew were in good health and met flying requirements, Chinese officials said Tuesday. China Eastern had been in contact with the family members of all 123 passengers onboard, according to Sun Shiying, chairman of the airline's subsidiary branch based in southwestern China's Yunnan province.</p><p>Boeing has said it was working with the airline and its experts are prepared to assist with the investigation.</p><p>Rachel Liang contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Elaine Yu at elaine.yu@wsj.com</p><p>Human Remains Found at China Eastern Airlines Plane Crash Site</p>",
