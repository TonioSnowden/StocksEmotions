  "title": "Lockheed Martin in Talks With Pentagon on Ukraine Weapons; World's largest defense company leaves full-year sales guidance unchanged",
  "text": "<p>Lockheed, the world's largest defense company by sales, and other military contractors said they have been fielding requests from Western governments for additional production, though some are still working through the impact of supply-chain challenges that have affected the broader manufacturing sector.</p><p>The company said Chief Executive Jim Taiclet was among CEOs from U.S. defense companies who met with Pentagon leaders last week to discuss Ukraine-related weapons needs and production levels. Raytheon Technologies Corp., Boeing Co., Northrop Grumman Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and L3Harris Technologies Inc. also attended the meeting, according to the Pentagon.</p><p>Shares of American and European defense companies have outperformed the broader market since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, lifted by the pledges of countries including Germany to increase military spending.</p><p>Lockheed produces F-35 combat jets that Germany now plans to buy, as well as F-16 fighters, Black Hawk helicopters and a range of munitions and missile-defense systems. However, executives said most new contracts would take years to fulfill.</p><p>The company, which on Tuesday reported forecast-beating quarterly profits, left its full-year sales guidance unchanged at $66 billion. Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave said any additional production for Ukraine wouldn't have an immediate impact on its financial results.</p><p>Lockheed reported a net profit of $1.73 billion in the latest quarter, down from $1.84 billion a year earlier, with sales falling 8% to $15 billion. Per-share profit of $6.44 beat the $6.11 consensus among analysts polled by FactSet.</p><p>Write to Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com</p><p>Lockheed Martin in Talks With Pentagon on Ukraine Weapons</p>",
