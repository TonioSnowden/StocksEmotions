  "text": "<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA was down 272 points, or 0.8%, at 34,482, after dropping 413 points at its session low.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 SPX fell 13 points, or 0.3%, at 4,448.</p><p>The Nasdaq Composite COMP fell 104 points, or 0.7%, to 13,790, after briefly turning higher around midday.</p><p>Last week, the Dow rose 5.5%, while the S&amp;P 500 advanced 6.2% and the Nasdaq Composite surged 8.2%. All three indexes saw their biggest weekly percentage gains since the week ended Nov. 6, 2020.</p><p>What's driving markets?</p><p>All three major stock indexes dropped and Treasurys aggressively sold off on Monday as Powell, speaking to the National Association for Business Economics, repeated that the central bank could deliver rate increases of larger than 25 basis points each at future meetings if policy makers deem it necessary in their fight to control inflation.</p><p>The Fed chief underlined the need to tighten monetary policy at a quick pace, adding that upward pressure on prices from the invasion of Ukraine comes at a time of “already too high inflation.”</p><p>“If we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal-funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings, we will do so,” he said</p><p>Powell also pushed back against fears the Fed can't aggressively raise rates without tipping the economy into recession, arguing that the central bank previously achieved soft landings as it tightened policy significantly in 1965, 1984 and 1994.

Alleghany shares rose almost 25% to around $843, while Berkshire Hathaway's B shares were up 2.1%.</p><p>Nielsen Holdings&#xa0;PLCNLSN rejected a roughly $9 billion takeover offer from a private-equity consortium, saying that it undervalues the TV-ratings company. Nielsen shares fell 7.2%.</p><p>Private-equity firm Thoma Bravo LP reached a deal to buy software maker Anaplan Inc.PLAN for $10.7 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
