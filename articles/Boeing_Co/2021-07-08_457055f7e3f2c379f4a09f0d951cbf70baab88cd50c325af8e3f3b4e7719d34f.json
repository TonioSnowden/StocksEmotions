  "text": "<p>Former president Donald Trump is suing Facebook, Twitter and Google's YouTube, as well as their respective chief executives, in lawsuits alleging “unlawful censorship” of Americans.</p> <p>Trump said he would <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86c98f3b-7d25-42b9-abf6-68b4b0839c66\">lead class actions</a> against chief executives Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey and Sundar Pichai, as well their Big Tech platforms.</p> <p>Twitter banned Trump from its platform permanently after the storming of Capitol Hill on January 6, citing repeated violations of its moderation policies and the risk that he could use it to incite further violence.&#xa0;</p> <p>Facebook&#xa0;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4fad1fee-ced6-45ab-bab9-63442b381336\">has banned</a>&#xa0;Trump for at least two years on similar grounds, while Google's YouTube has indefinitely suspended his account.</p> <p>The legal effort announced yesterday is supported by America First Policy Institute, a non-profit dedicated to promoting Trump's policies.</p> <h1>Five more stories in the news</h1> <p><strong>1. Fed officials debate stimulus withdrawal</strong> Federal Reserve officials held a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2ecb6496-9bb6-4bc8-b619-96b7ae9274f2\">vigorous debate last month</a> on when the US economic rebound would be strong enough for the central bank to start dialling back its pandemic-era stimulus, minutes from its June meeting revealed.</p> <p><strong>2. Hedging losses hobble US shale</strong> Some of America's biggest oil groups are racking up <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0d60da9b-54ad-4027-b054-2ff25261e506\">tens of billions of dollars</a> in hedging losses despite soaring crude prices, as contracts signed during last year's crash leave them selling their output at deeply discounted prices. US oil is trading near six-year highs of about $75 a barrel, but almost a third of the US's 11m barrels a day of production is being sold for just $55 a barrel.</p> <p><strong>3. Gates Foundation unveils break-up plan </strong>The $50bn charitable foundation has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6bd52f7e-f8bb-4de6-800c-0112c035da3c\">announced a plan</a> that would allow Melinda French Gates to resign as co-chair and receive “personal resources” from her estranged husband for her own philanthropic effort if she or Bill Gates decided they could no longer work together.</p> <p><strong>4. Haiti's president assassinated </strong>Haiti has been thrust into turmoil after its president, Jovenel Moïse, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/781475e8-caf6-45a2-960c-102efefc27eb\">was assassinated</a> in the early hours of Wednesday in his private home on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. Police said they shot dead four people suspected of the killing and arrested two others.</p> <p><strong>5. England's footballers reach first final since 1966 </strong>England reached their first final of a major football tournament in 55 years last night after <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0a10e41d-40fe-4a3c-8eed-e2bb23fa110b\">beating Denmark 2-1</a> in the second Euro 2020 semi-final.

Nearing retirement presents an opportunity to develop skills.

History is neither in the business of self-congratulation nor self-flagellation. It is in the truth business. America's founding myths did not begin with “woke” activists, but were there from the start, he writes.</p> <p><strong>Italy's great survivor </strong>Silvio Berlusconi, who for decades has seduced Italy with tales of entrepreneurial daring and stamina, is <a href=\"https://ft.com/content/40fabf64-e684-4772-9ac8-a96ec7e1ae1d\">planning his last act</a>: succession.
