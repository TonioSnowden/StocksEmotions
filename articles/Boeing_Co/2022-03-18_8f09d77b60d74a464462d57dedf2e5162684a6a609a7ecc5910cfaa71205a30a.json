  "title": "Putin Taps Central Bank Chief for Third Term With Mandate to Cushion Economy From Sanctions; Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's central bank chief, left rates unchanged but signaled the economy faces an inevitable period of higher inflation",
  "text": "<p>\"The Russian economy is entering the phase of a large-scale structural transformation, which will be accompanied by a temporary but inevitable period of increased inflation,\" the central bank said in a statement Friday.</p><p>The bank, helmed by Ms. Nabiullina, left interest rates unchanged. She had already more than doubled rates last month to 20% after Western governments imposed sanctions that seek to cut Russia off from the global economy.</p><p>Ms. Nabiullina's reappointment solidifies her role as one of Russia's top economic generals, tasked with keeping the country's financial system functioning and commerce flowing while fighting rages in Ukraine. Her current term is due to end in June. She is expected to speak later Friday.</p><p>\"The president has repeatedly praised the results of the work of Nabiullina and the central bank as a whole. And we see how logical it was to introduce her candidacy for another term,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday.</p><p>Ms. Nabiullina has run the central bank since 2013. She cleaned up several failed banks, gained a reputation for keeping a lid on inflation and built up the $640 billion in foreign-exchange reserves that have so far proved to be of limited use in cushioning the blow from western sanctions. Russia was able to pay foreign bondholders on its sovereign debt this week, a sign that some of those reserves remain accessible for certain payments.</p><p>After the fresh round of sanctions was unveiled last month, including directly on the central bank, Ms. Nabiullina unveiled a raft of measures to shore up the banking system.</p><p>Other measures included strict capital controls to limit transfers of foreign currency out of the country. She also gave Russia's commercial banks leeway in accounting for bad loans as a way to stave off insolvency and bank runs.</p><p>While the impact of sanctions will take weeks and months to reverberate through the economy, it has already led to factory closures and a surge in inflation. Over 400 Western companies, including McDonald's Corp., Apple Inc. and Boeing Co., have said they are pausing or ending operations there, according to a tally by Jeffrey Sonnenfeld at the Yale School of Management.</p><p>As a result, Russia's economic outlook has deteriorated sharply, reflecting the isolation of its economic and financial system, with some analysts predicting gross domestic product will fall by 10% or more this year.</p><p>\"The current shock to the Russian economy is deeply recessionary,\" said Sofya Donets, Russian economist at Renaissance Capital investment bank, in a note to clients this week.</p><p>Mr. Putin on Wednesday acknowledged that the economy had suffered a hit.</p><p>\"Our economy will need deep structural changes in these new realities, and I won't hide this—they won't be easy,\" Mr. Putin said. He pledged to increase payments to pensioners and state employees, a hike in the minimum wage and financial assistance to businesses.</p><p>Western sanctions have affected 84% of small businesses, compared with 26% before Russia's invasion, according to a survey by Mr. Putin's business ombudsman, Boris Titov.</p><p>The central bank Friday said that Russia's economy would contract over coming quarters as businesses faced difficulties getting hold of needed parts.</p><p>\"A sharp surge in uncertainty weighs heavily on the sentiment and expectations of households and businesses,\" the central bank said Friday.</p><p>The ruble has lost more than a fifth of its value against the dollar since Mr. Putin's decision to invade Ukraine in late February. It had been down more than 40% earlier this month before recovering some losses.</p><p>The slide in the ruble has fueled a surge in inflation. Prices were up 5.6% since the start of the year, according to official statistics as of March 11, easily exceeding the 4% target set by the central bank for the entire year. Russians across the country have reported challenges in getting things like sugar, whose price has jumped 15% just this month. Authorities have suspended some agricultural exports in a bid to stabilize prices.</p><p>Prices for staples are up sharply, including the so-called borscht set—the vegetables needed for Russia's beloved red-magenta colored soup—which is a bellwether indicator for many Russians. Since the start of the year, the price of cabbage has risen by over 30%, carrots are up by around 20% and potatoes are up by 5%.</p><p>Increasing consumer prices are a sensitive topic for Mr. Putin as falling living standards in the past decade have often become a catalyst for mass protests.</p><p>Write to Paul Hannon at paul.hannon@wsj.com and Georgi Kantchev at georgi.kantchev@wsj.com</p><p>Putin Taps Central Bank Chief for Third Term With Mandate to Cushion Economy From Sanctions</p>",
