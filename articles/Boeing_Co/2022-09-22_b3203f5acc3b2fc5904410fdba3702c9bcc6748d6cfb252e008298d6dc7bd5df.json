  "title": "Boeing Poised to Settle SEC Investigation Related to 737 MAX Crashes; Securities regulator probed allegations the company made misleading statements to investors about crashes and jet program",
  "text": "<p>Mr. Muilenburg led Boeing through the two crashes, which took 346 lives, and months of their aftermath. His predictions about when the 737 MAX would return to service frustrated the company's airline customers and senior leaders at the Federal Aviation Administration, which had grounded the plane after the second crash, in Ethiopia, in March 2019. Boeing's board forced out Mr. Muilenburg at the end of that year.</p><p>The SEC enforces laws that require public companies like Boeing to disclose material facts and other information that shareholders need to make investment decisions. The agency investigated how Boeing communicated with investors about the crashes and its response to the crisis, which wiped out billions of dollars of the company's market value. The Justice Department conducted a separate criminal investigation that alleged a former Boeing pilot misled air-safety regulators about how the MAX's flight-control system worked.</p><p>Boeing paid $2.5 billion—most of that earmarked for airline customers and families of the crash victims—to settle the DOJ's criminal probe. In March, a federal jury in Texas acquitted the former pilot of all criminal charges against him.</p><p>Write to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com, Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com and Emily Glazer at emily.glazer@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing Poised to Settle SEC Investigation Related to 737 MAX Crashes</p>",
