  "title": "Boeing losses mount in $1.2bn hit from Ukraine and Air Force One",
  "text": "<p>Boeing said its losses widened in the first quarter as it took a $1.2bn hit tied to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Air Force One replacement programme it negotiated with former US president Donald Trump.</p> <p>The aerospace group reported a net loss of $1.24bn, or $2.06 a share, compared with a narrower loss of $561mn, or 92 cents a share, in the year-ago period.</p> <p>Chicago-based <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/stream/6f219ed8-b11c-4239-9891-eaa3ba2523a1\">Boeing</a> recorded a $212mn pre-tax charge because of “near-term challenges” stemming from the Ukraine war. </p> <p>The company also outlined $1bn charges in a “messy quarter” for its defence business, according to chief executive Dave Calhoun. That included a $660mn charge related to producing<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2213bce0-8e99-4e7e-8dd4-508ce3013c49\"> two Air Force One</a> jets, the US presidential aircraft, driven by higher supplier costs, as well as a $367mn charge tied to its T-7A Red Hawk programme, a military pilot training system, because of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. The fixed-term nature of the contracts left Boeing on the hook for any additional costs.</p> <p>Air Force One negotiations presented “a very unique set of risks that Boeing probably shouldn't have taken”, Calhoun said on an earnings call on Wednesday. The production of the two aircraft was commissioned by Trump during former CEO Dennis Muilenburg's tenure.</p> <p>The aircraft manufacturer signed a $3.9bn deal in 2018 after Trump <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f50983b2-bbc7-11e6-8b45-b8b81dd5d080\">tweeted</a> that the US government should scrap Boeing's Air Force One contract because the original $5bn estimate was “ridiculous.” Boeing moved to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d2bd472b-0e5d-459f-8503-04633aefeb87\">renegotiate</a> the contract last year.</p> <p>Boeing also forecast a further $1.5bn in abnormal costs related to its wide-body 777 programme beginning in the current quarter as it stopped production and again delayed the delivery of the jet to 2025. </p> <p>Revenues fell 8 per cent from a year ago to $14bn, falling short of expectations for $16bn, according to analysts polled by Refinitiv. Shares fell as much as 12.6 per cent to $146 in morning trade on Wednesday, before trimming their losses to trade 8 per cent lower.</p> <p>“We still have more work to do,” Calhoun said in a message to employees as the company burnt through $3.2bn of cash in the first quarter. He expects Boeing to generate positive operating cash flow for the full year as other programmes recover.</p> <p>The Air Force One and 777 delays come as Boeing has faced numerous setbacks within its <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/683a9104-dd14-4113-9034-0c4522259cab\">Dreamliner programme</a> after the discovery of manufacturing flaws and a subsequent investigation by US regulators, thus compounding issues for the company.</p> <p>Production on the 787 Dreamliner remained stalled, though Boeing said it had submitted its certification plan to the US Federal Aviation Administration, with reworks completed on the initial aircraft. Total costs related to the wide-body jet remained unchanged at $5.5bn.</p> <p>Production has increased on the 737 Max and is expected to reach a production rate of 31 per month in the second quarter. The aircraft has returned to service in most countries, with China the notable outlier, following its worldwide grounding after two fatal crashes.</p> <p>Boeing also said it expects “solid demand” for its defence products “as governments prioritise security, defence technology and global co-operation given all these threats” stemming from the Ukraine war. It noted US president Joe Biden's 2023 defence budget proposes increased funding for Boeing's F-15EX fighter jet.</p> <p>Rival General Dynamics said this week it also expects higher demand and spending from western governments that support Ukraine as they <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1014282b-1309-440e-9eda-b8ebd18d55c9\">replenish</a> their missile and defence supplies.</p><p>Source: Steff Chávez in Chicago 2022 'Boeing losses mount in $1.2bn hit from Ukraine and Air Force One' FT.com 27 April.
