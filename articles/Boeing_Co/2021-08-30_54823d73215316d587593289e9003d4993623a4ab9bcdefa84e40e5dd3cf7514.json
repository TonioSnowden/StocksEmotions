  "title": "Business News: Snarled Supply Chains Send Goods to Air --- Cargo planes fly at almost 90% capacity as peak season starts; car tires ride in cabins",
  "text": "<p>Pinch points include overflowing airport cargo warehouses, spilling goods into off-site facilities and exacerbating the shortage of staff to sort, load and unload jets. Airlines have responded by expanding cargo flights beyond the biggest gateways to such cities as Columbus, Ohio, and Tampa, Fla., to avoid congestion. Sometimes the cabins of repurposed passenger planes are used for cargo.</p><p>\"We are at the limit,\" said Bernhard Kindelbacher, head of cargo operations in the U.S. and Canada for Deutsche Lufthansa AG, one of the world's largest airfreight carriers.</p><p>Charles Goodwin, operations director at the Columbus Regional Airport Authority, said car tires packed between the seats of repurposed passenger jets are among the cargo now being flown that once traveled by sea. \"The entire supply chain seems to be full,\" Mr. Goodwin said.</p><p>Flying goods by air is the last -- and priciest -- option for many manufacturers and retailers to move products through a global supply chain already snarled by pandemic-driven closures of Chinese seaports and widespread labor shortages.</p><p>Airfreight accounts for less than 1% of global trade by weight but more than 30% by value, according to the International Air Transport Association, a trade group.</p><p>The share of global airline industry revenue for freight traffic has doubled to around 30% from pre-pandemic levels, according to IATA. Soaring shipping prices have made freight a profit center for many airlines, offsetting some of the airline industry losses, which the trade group estimates will top $48 billion this year.</p><p>\"It is cargo demand that is determining where we fly,\" Pieter Bootsma, chief revenue officer at Air France-KLM SA, said in April.</p><p>The near shutdown of many airlines in spring 2020 removed most of the 50% of global air cargo capacity that is usually in the bellies of passenger jets. Cargo carriers pulled idled jets from desert storage, and passenger planes were repurposed to carry goods in cabins to help meet demand for personal protective equipment. More than half of the orders for wide-body jets secured by Boeing Co. this year are for cargo aircraft, and both Boeing and rival Airbus SE are exploring new freighter planes.</p><p>International passenger flight capacity is still down more than 50% from pre-pandemic levels, according to IATA, leaving dedicated cargo aircraft and repurposed passenger planes to pick up the slack, just as many industrial economies roar back from pandemic-induced slowdowns.</p><p>The summer is traditionally a relative lull for air cargo as factories close for staff vacations and maintenance. IATA, however, said cargo jets are flying fuller this summer than at any time since it started keeping records in 1990. The combination of inventory restocking and ocean-cargo logjams boosted the appeal of airfreight, according to the group, even though pricing is 80% above pre-pandemic levels.</p><p>In Columbus, traffic at Rickenbacker International Airport is up 50% from a year earlier as carriers including Korean Air Lines Co. have added cargo service. The airport has benefited in part from the spillover of cargo business from congested gateways including Chicago.</p>",
