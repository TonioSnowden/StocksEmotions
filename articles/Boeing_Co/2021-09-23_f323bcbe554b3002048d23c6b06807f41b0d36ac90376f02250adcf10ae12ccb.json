  "text": "<p>Extend Sailing Pause</p><p>Carnival Corp.'s Australia-based businesses said they are extending their sailing pause through mid-January because of uncertainty in the region amid the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>The move means the units are forgoing certain summer and New Year holiday voyages, adding financial pressure to the cruise lines as Australian authorities have implemented further restrictions with the spread of the Delta variant.</p><p>Princess Cruises said it is pausing its cruise vacations in Australia and New Zealand to Jan. 27, 2022. The cruise line is canceling Coral Princess voyages through Jan. 17, as well as Royal Princess and Sapphire Princess seasons through March 2022.</p><p>P&amp;O Cruises Australia said it is pausing cruises scheduled to depart from Dec. 18 through Jan. 14 for Brisbane, and through Jan. 18 for Sydney. It is scrapping its Melbourne summer season.</p><p>Princes Cruises said customers booked on a canceled cruise have the option to move to an equivalent future cruise, get a future cruise credit equivalent to the cruise fare paid plus an additional nonrefundable bonus credit equal to 10% of the cruise fare paid, or a full refund to the original form of payment.</p><p>P&amp;O Cruises Australia said customers whose bookings have been affected will be notified of options available either directly or through their appointed travel agent.</p><p>-- Dave Sebastian</p><p>---</p><p>NEWS CORP</p><p>Board Backs $1 Billion</p><p>Stock Buyback</p><p>News Corp's board authorized a $1 billion stock-repurchase program, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal said.</p><p>The program will include the purchase of a combination of Class A common shares and Class B common shares. It replaces a previous program to buy back $500 million shares of Class A stock that the board approved in 2013.</p><p>The authorization for the new buyback program follows a new stockholders agreement between News Corp and the family trust of Rupert Murdoch, the company's executive chairman. Under the agreement, News Corp and the family trust must avoid actions that would give the trust and Murdoch family members more than 44% of the outstanding voting power of the company's Class B stock, News Corp said. News Corp's holdings include Dow Jones Newswires, digital real estate services and the HarperCollins publishing division.</p><p>-- Matt Grossman</p><p>---</p><p>BOEING</p><p>Site Is Picked for</p><p>Drone Assembly Plant</p><p>Boeing Co. has chosen a site for an assembly plant -- its first outside the U. S. -- to build its autonomous Loyal Wingman drone.</p><p>Australia has ordered six of the aircraft, which was also designed there, but Boeing has yet to clinch a place on the Pentagon's similar Skyborg program. General Atomics and Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions Inc. were recently selected by the Air Force to continue work on Skyborg, eliminating Boeing from the current phase of the program.</p><p>-- Doug Cameron</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
