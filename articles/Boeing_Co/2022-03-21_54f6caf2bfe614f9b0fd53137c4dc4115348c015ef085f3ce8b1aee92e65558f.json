  "text": "<p>We don't know yet why China Eastern flight 5735 crashed, and it could be some time before we doâ€”crash investigations often take months or years. Investigators usually try to find and analyze the plane's flight-data recorder and cockpit voice recorder to help gain insights into a flight's final moments. Typically when a Boeing Co. plane crashes abroad, the National Transportation Safety Board is invited to participate as a U.S. representative and the Federal Aviation Administration provides technical support, along with technical assistance from Boeing and the engine supplier.</p><p>The FAA said in a written statement that it was aware of the crash. \"The agency is ready to assist in investigation efforts if asked,\" it said.</p><p>What do we know about the people aboard?</p><p>The plane was carrying 123 passengers and nine crew members, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said. Rescue teams have been sent to the area, but it couldn't be determined yet whether there were any survivors. If everyone aboard is confirmed dead, it would mark China's deadliest crash in nearly three decades.</p><p>What kind of plane was it?</p><p>The plane was a Boeing Co. 737-800. That is an older-generation model than the Boeing 737 MAX, which was grounded in 2019 after two fatal crashes. The MAX hasn't resumed commercial flying in China.</p><p>The 737-800 is one of the workhorses of the commercial aviation industry, with roughly 4,200 in service world-wide. It is the most popular of the 737 NG family of jets, which has one of the best safety records in commercial aviation. For the 737 NG family, fatal accidents in which the aircraft is damaged beyond repair have been relatively rare, with 0.09 such events per million departures over the course of almost 25 years in operation, according to a safety study of aircraft accidents through 2020 published by Boeing in September.</p><p>The plane involved in the crash Monday was relatively new. It first flew in June 2015.</p><p>China Eastern grounded the rest of its 737-800 fleet after the crash. Other airlines around the world continue to fly the jet.</p><p>What was the plane's itinerary?</p><p>The flight crashed about an hour and seven minutes into its journey from the southwestern city of Kunming to the southern metropolis of Guangzhou.</p><p>After climbing to an altitude of 29,100 feet, the jet cruised for 12 minutes at a speed of roughly 455 knots, or 524 miles per hour, according to Flightradar24 data. At 2:20 p.m. local time, its nose suddenly angled toward the ground.</p><p>The jet then plummeted from the sky, reaching vertical speeds of 31,000 feet per minute. It plunged more than 20,000 feet, to an altitude of 7,425 feet, then managed to gain about 1,200 feet in altitude before again nose diving toward the mountain, the data shows. The aircraft stopped transmitting at 3,225 feet, less than two minutes after entering the dive.</p><p>What is China's air-safety record?</p><p>China sharply improved its air-safety record after a series of fatal airplane crashes in the 1990s. In 1994, a Russian-made Tupolev Tu-154M operated by China Northwest Airlines, which has since merged with China Eastern, crashed on its way from the city of Xi'an to Guangzhou, killing all 160 people aboard.</p><p>The most recent fatal crash of a Chinese passenger airline happened in August 2010, when a jetliner made by Brazil's Embraer SA and operated by Henan Airlines crashed while landing on the runway, killing 42 of the 96 people aboard.</p><p>China Eastern, based in Shanghai, had gone more than 17 years without a fatal accident before Monday.</p><p>This article might be updated .</p><p>Write to Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com</p><p>China Plane Crash: What to Know About the Boeing 737 Jet With 132 People Aboard</p>",
