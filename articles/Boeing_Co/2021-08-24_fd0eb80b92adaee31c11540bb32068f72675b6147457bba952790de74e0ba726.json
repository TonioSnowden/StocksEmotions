  "title": "Business News:  Boeing Set  To Invest in  Virgin Orbit  ----  By Alistair MacDonald",
  "text": "<p>   Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit said Boeing Co. will invest in the satellite-launching startup's planned $3.2 billion SPAC listing later this year, an investment that comes as the plane maker's own space program faces hurdles. </p><p>   Virgin Orbit said it would list on the Nasdaq Stock Market by merging with NextGen Acquisition Corp., a special-purpose acquisition company run by former Goldman Sachs banker George Mattson and Greg Summe, a former senior executive at the Carlyle Group. </p><p>   Boeing's planned investment, which The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier Monday, comes through a SPAC-related fundraising round called a private investment in public equity, or PIPE. That fundraising has garnered a total of $100 million in commitments, Virgin Orbit said. </p><p>   A Boeing spokeswoman declined to say how much it was investing. She said it was a strategic move and the Chicago-based company has a longstanding relationship with the Virgin Group. Boeing already has an investment in Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc., Mr. Branson's space-tourism business. \"We believe in the importance of the satellite launch market and the capabilities Virgin Orbit brings to the industry,\" she said. </p><p>   Private-equity fund AE Industrial Partners LP will also invest in the PIPE, Virgin said. AE Industrial Partners didnt return a request for comment Monday. </p><p>   Virgin Orbit's plans to seek a SPAC-related listing were first reported earlier this year by the Journal. </p><p>   Boeing's planned investment coincides with its struggles with its own space business. The launch of Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which the company had hoped would allow it to eventually send manned NASA missions to the International Space Station, was delayed earlier this month because of faulty valves. </p><p>   Virgin Orbit's planned listing comes as investors increasingly bet on the falling costs of accessing space for business, tourism and scientific research. </p><p>   Mr. Branson's Virgin Group owns 80% of Virgin Orbit, with Mubadala Investment Co., the United Arab Emirates sovereign-wealth fund, owning the rest. \"It's another milestone for empowering all of those working today to build space technology that will positively change the world,\" Mr. Branson said. </p><p>   Earlier this year, Mr. Branson beat fellow billionaire Jeff Bezos into space in a high-profile trip that took him on a Virgin Galactic spacecraft more than 50 miles above Earth. </p><p>   Virgin Orbit has completed two successful satellite launches this year, lifting the company into a small group of small-satellite launch providers able to offer flight-proven hardware. The company uses a converted jumbo jet to release a rocket, which then fires up and carries its payload of small satellites into orbit. </p><p></p>",
