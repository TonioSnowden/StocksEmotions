  "title": "U.S. Officials Get Approval to Travel for China Plane Crash Probe; National Transportation Safety Board investigators hope to leave for China this week",
  "text": "<p>While China is leading the investigation, under international-aviation rules, U.S. representatives are allowed to participate in part because the plane involved in the crash—a Boeing 737-800—was made in the U.S.</p><p>It wasn't immediately clear when the U.S. team would depart, but the safety board said it hopes the team will leave this week. The NTSB has already appointed a senior official to lead its team and has been in touch with the Chinese investigator-in-charge, a spokesman said earlier.</p><p>The crash on March 21 of the China Eastern plane caused it to disintegrate when it nosedived into a mountain in southern China, scattering debris across a wide area of heavily wooded and rugged terrain.</p><p>On Sunday, a team of firefighters found the aircraft's flight-data recorder buried several feet underground roughly 130 feet from where the plane crashed in southern China's Guangxi autonomous region, officials said. That device, along with a cockpit-voice recorder that search teams found last week, should help investigators determine why the aircraft crashed, flight-safety experts have said.</p><p>Flight-data recorders track details about flights, including airspeed and the position of the wing flaps. Cockpit-voice recorders typically keep a rolling two-hour record of the sounds in the cockpit. In addition to the recorders, investigators have said more than 33,000 pieces of debris from the crash have been found.</p><p>Overseas travelers entering China are required to quarantine themselves for at least two weeks, with many cities adopting an additional period of a week or longer of isolation at home or government facilities.</p><p>Investigators in China have said all 132 people on board the plane died, making it the country's worst air disaster since 1994.</p><p>Yoko Kubota contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com</p><p>U.S. Officials Get Approval to Travel for China Plane Crash Probe</p>",
