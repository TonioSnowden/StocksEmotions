  "text": "<p>\"We expect many consumers will want to fly with friends or family, and we will customize the experience to meet their individual preferences,\" Virgin Galactic Chief Executive Michael Colglazier told investors Thursday.</p><p>Shares for Virgin Galactic were up around 8% Friday.</p><p>Virgin Galactic and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin LLC are preparing to start ferrying consumers to space following their respective high-profile flights last month with their founders on board.</p><p>Last month, the company flew Mr. Branson and three Virgin Galactic executives more than 50 miles up, departing from the Spaceport America facility in New Mexico.</p><p>The level of demand for such trips isn't fully clear, though some analysts have estimated the industry by 2030 could generate nearly $4 billion in sales for that year. Virgin Galactic has said it has 600 reservations for future flights, while Mr. Bezos said in July that Blue Origin was approaching $100 million in ticket sales.</p><p>Other companies, including Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the formal name for Elon Musk's SpaceX, are also eyeing the space-tourism market. Boeing Co. has said tourists could take seats on future missions of its Starliner space capsule.</p><p>Virgin Galactic had previously said it sold tickets for space flights at as much as $250,000 each. The $450,000 per-seat price, meanwhile, is more than what some analysts had been expecting.</p><p>In addition, Virgin Galactic said it plans to charge the equivalent of $600,000 a seat for research and professional-astronaut missions.</p>",
