  "title": "Ukraine's Capital Awaits a Potential Russian Attack With Determination, Calm; Even as the mood shifts and Kyiv empties of foreigners, there are few signs of panic among residents",
  "text": "<p>Hotels and nightclubs have emptied of tourists and many foreign businesspeople have left, too. And Ukrainians, many of whom initially dismissed the troop buildup as a hollow threat and America's reaction as overblown, say they are increasingly worried that a bloody conflict is coming.</p><p>\"There has been a turning point in the popular mind-set,\" said economist Oleksiy Kushch. \"People are starting to sense war.\"</p><p>On the surface, life carries on. Stores are fully stocked. Restaurants and bars are busy. Couples carry Valentine's Day bouquets. The Kyiv opera theater performed \"Romeo and Juliet\" on Sunday night. ATMs keep dispensing cash. Nobody is digging trenches, putting up blackout curtains or taping windows.</p><p>But many businesses report that foreign counterparts are pausing transactions, waiting to see whether this ancient city of three million people will become a war zone. Though the Ukrainian hryvnia's exchange rate is holding for now, thanks to central-bank intervention, capital outflows are putting the banking system under growing strain.</p><p>The airline industry is also under pressure. Kyiv on Sunday rushed a $583 million fund for the industry after one of the country's main airlines, Sky Up, said it was suspending operations because its insurers refused to cover flights in Ukrainian airspace. Another carrier, Ukraine International Airlines, said Monday it was forced to send five leased Boeing 737-800 planes to Spain because insurers terminated coverage for the country. The remainder of its fleet is still operating.</p><p>\"While the military threat is possible but for now remains theoretical, the military tension has already caused irreversible damage to Ukraine's economy,\" said Halyna Yanchenko, the deputy head of the majority coalition in Ukraine's parliament.</p><p>Despite the growing realization that a Russian military invasion is a real possibility, there are few outward signs of panic. That is a change from the chaotic events of 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula and began the war in the eastern Donbas region in response to an uprising that ousted a pro-Russian president in Kyiv.</p><p>\"In 2014, there was a fear of the unknown,\" said Ms. Yanchenko. \"Now, everyone has been tempered by war. People have become stubborn. They are ready to do anything to repel this bloodthirsty aggressor.\"</p><p>President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday criticized foreign embassies for leaving Kyiv and urged some 20 Ukrainian lawmakers traveling overseas and business tycoons who have been leaving the country to return immediately. \"My own family is always with me, always with Ukraine,\" Mr. Zelensky said. \"A citizen is not someone who carries a passport but someone who chooses to remain in Ukraine, today.\"</p><p>Victoria Voytsitska, a former parliament member who now works in investment and real estate, drove on Monday to western Ukraine with her 6-year-old son and her 20-year-old daughter, to deposit them with her husband's parents. This was the first day Ms. Voytsitska could leave home quarantine after having contracted Covid-19. Most other cars she saw at the highway gas station were also filled with children.</p><p>\"There is no reason for our kids to be in Kyiv, especially if there is a full-scale Russian military operation,\" she said. After a short rest in her in-laws' home, Ms. Voytsitska set out for a long drive back to the Ukrainian capital, where she said she planned to join the new territorial defense force. \"If, God forbid, the calamity does happen, there will be plenty of things for us to do in Kyiv,\" she said. \"We will be busy.\"</p><p>Film director Semen Mozgovy said he already hired a minivan to evacuate his mother and grandmother from his hometown of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine to the country's west, should that be necessary. His mother, a school teacher, arranged for a friend to move to their home so it doesn't get looted. As Mr. Mozgovy is currently stuck working with a TV crew in eastern Ukraine, his main priority now is to arrange for someone to pick up in Kyiv the hard drives containing several years of his work and to ferry them to safety. As soon as Mr. Mozgovy returns to Kyiv, he also plans to join territorial defense forces. \"There is no fear, just shock and refusal to believe that all this can be true,\" he said.</p><p>Ukraine's interior minister, Denis Monastyrski, who commands the police and National Guard troops, said in a Monday address that the government wouldn't allow a repeat of the events of 2014, when Russian-backed militants seized or attempted to seize government buildings by force in several cities across eastern and southern Ukraine.</p><p>This time, \"they will be shot on the spot by our special forces without any warning or hesitation,\" Mr. Monastyrski said. \"It's not 2014. Ukraine is stronger and more organized.\"</p><p>Ukrainian lawmaker Mustafa Dzhemilev, a leader of the Crimean Tatars who had to leave the peninsula after the Russian occupation of 2014 and moved to Kyiv, said he has no intention of going anywhere this time.</p><p>\"People are thinking more about how to defend the city than how to escape it,\" he said. \"Ukraine is not what it used to be, and Russia will not have a walk in a park here.\"</p><p>Anastasia, a 27-year-old information-technology specialist in Kyiv who didn't want her last name used, said she is also staying put, at least for now: \"I don't want to create panic and I want to continue living our normal lives.\"</p><p>However, she said she has prepared a go bag in case she has to leave with a first-aid kit, documents, cash and a battery-powered radio to help her keep abreast of the news. She is still looking for a good map for when mobile-phone service goes down and she can no longer use the internet.</p><p>She said she would travel to her parents' home in western Ukraine in case authorities declare a general mobilization. Her boyfriend, a medical doctor, is likely to join the military if war begins.</p><p>Some others, however, are already relocating. The Ukrainian Leadership Academy, which runs a program for high-school graduates, has moved its students from Kyiv and the cities of Mykolaiv, Mariupol and Kharkiv to the western Ukrainian cities of Lviv, Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk.</p><p>\"Those places are not under as much risk in case of an escalation,\" said the academy's chief executive, Roman Tychkivskyy. \"Even if the enemy decides to also occupy western Ukraine, it will take them time to get there.\"</p><p>Lviv, the largest city in western Ukraine, which sits just over an hour's drive from the Polish border, has already become the country's backup hub. The Canadian Embassy now operates out of a hotel near the city's medieval Market Square.</p><p>The U.S. relocated to Lviv a skeleton staff providing limited consular services. Western Ukraine, which belonged to Poland before World War II, experienced several years of anti-Soviet insurgency after 1945 and would be particularly hard for a Russian occupation force to control.</p><p>Lviv Mayor Andriy Sadovyi said his city is bracing for hundreds of thousands of newcomers from the rest of Ukraine should full-scale war erupt in coming days. \"My family can accept another family,\" he said. \"And I think the majority of other Lviv families will take in another family.\"</p><p>Write to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com</p><p>Ukraine's Capital Awaits a Potential Russian Attack With Determination, Calm</p>",
