  "title": "NASA's Massive Rocket Blasts Off in Test Run for Return to Moon; The Space Launch System rocket roared off a launchpad early Wednesday morning, a big step in the agency's plans to return to the surface of the moon",
  "text": "<p>NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the agency had faced false starts with the 2011-retired space shuttle as well. PHOTO: Sarah Blesener for The Wall Street Journal</p><p>The vehicle could be seen ascending from Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy site, generating a delayed rumble that could be felt miles away and briefly lighting up the sky. Two missile-shaped boosters strapped to the main part of the rocket provided most of the thrust at launch, with help from four engines at the bottom of the vehicle.</p><p>\"We rise together back to the moon and beyond,\" said Derrol Nail, NASA's live-stream commentator upon liftoff.</p><p>Interactive: An Inside Look at the SLS Rocket</p><p>The flight is a critical jumping-off point for Artemis, NASA's multiyear program to return astronauts to the lunar surface for the first time since 1972 and set the stage for broader agency space-exploration efforts.</p><p>Artemis I, as this mission is called, is designed as an intense test of the vehicles that NASA is depending on, specifically the Space Launch System rocket that will blast the uncrewed Orion spacecraft toward the moon. Boeing Co. developed the SLS rocket, while Lockheed Martin Corp. is the lead company behind Orion.</p><p>SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</p><p>Will you be watching NASA's moon rocket launch this Wednesday? Join the conversation below.</p><p>Blastoff occurred after NASA struggled to load super-cold fuel into the rocket during two earlier potential launch attempts, had to conduct repairs on the SLS and navigated around two hurricanes. The costly rocket has been in the works for more than a decade, with contractors behind it struggling at times with delays and production challenges.</p><p>Before the launch, NASA filled up the 538,263-gallon liquid-hydrogen fuel tank, a contrast to earlier attempts when engineers struggled with leaks of the propellant. The agency developed fresh procedures to ease the super-cold propellant into the tank following a second cancellation.</p><p>Write to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com</p><p>NASA's Massive Rocket Blasts Off in Test Run for Return to Moon</p>",
