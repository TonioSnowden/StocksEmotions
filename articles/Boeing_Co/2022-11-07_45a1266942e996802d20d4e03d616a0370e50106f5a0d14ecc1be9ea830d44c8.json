Stock Market Today: Live coverage of Monday's market action</p><p>What drove markets</p><p>Stock investors were looking ahead to Tuesday's midterm elections with an upbeat attitude, assessing headlines over the potential for eventual talks between Russia and Ukraine, and bracing for the next major U.S. inflation update this week. Read: What midterms mean for the stock market's 'best 6 months' as favorable calendar stretch gets under way Markets moved on Monday \"with some anticipation of the midterm elections tomorrow and we know there's a very, very high chance that Republicans will take at least one chamber of Congress, which will be positive for markets,\" said Dan Eye, chief investment officer at Pittsburgh-based Fort Pitt Capital Group, which oversaw $4.2 billion in assets as of September.</p><p>See: The stock market could pop higher after midterms: Morgan Stanley's Mike Wilson</p><p>\"And maybe with the Fed meeting behind us, there's more clarity on rate hikes than there was a week ago,\" Eye said. \"We now know policy makers are thinking that as early as December they could slow the pace of interest hikes and that the terminal rate will probably go higher than thought in September, but markets have priced a lot of that in.\"</p><p>\"We still have this big inflation report on Thursday and know that if the market moves the other way and things turn south, it's because investors are looking to position conservatively ahead of the well-anticipated CPI (consumer-price index) report,\" he said.</p><p>Last week, the Fed delivered a 75-basis-point, or three-quarters of a percentage point, increase in the fed-funds rate, as expected. However, Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized that rates would need to move higher than Fed officials had previously expected and signaled borrowing costs may remain elevated. The Dow's more-than-400-point jump on Monday was led by gains in shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA, Salesforce Inc. CRM, and Boeing Co. BA.

Of those, 73 had issued fourth-quarter guidance, and 50 of those — 68% — missed expectations with their holiday guidance, higher than the 5- and 10-year historical averages, FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters said in a note.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 is now expected to report a year-over-year earnings decline in the fourth quarter, after forecasts from the current earnings season sent expectations from a 0.2% gain to a 1% decline last week, according to FactSet. Should that forecast hold, along with expectations for growth in the third quarter, it would break an eight-quarter pandemic-era streak of earnings gains.</p><p>Earnings Watch: The end of the pandemic earnings boom is in sight as holiday forecasts disappoint See also: S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for 2023 take 'complete U-turn' as recession risks loom, according to BofA</p><p>Companies in focus</p><p>* Class A shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc.
