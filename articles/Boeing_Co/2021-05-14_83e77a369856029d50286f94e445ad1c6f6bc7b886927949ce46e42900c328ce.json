  "text": "<p>Portugal has said it will welcome British tourists from Monday, removing some of the uncertainty hanging over the long-awaited reopening of international travel from the UK.</p> <p>The decision ends doubts for airlines and travel companies over whether Portugal would open its borders in time for holidaymakers to take advantage of decisions by the governments in England, Wales and Scotland to allow international travel to resume on Monday.</p> <p>Northern Ireland has yet to outline its plans. </p> <p>The London office of Portugal's National Tourist Board said in a statement on Friday that the Portuguese foreign ministry was revoking travel restrictions for British visitors that had excluded tourists.</p> <p>The statement said all visitors to Portugal would have to show a negative PCR Covid-19 test made 72 hours before departure. The tourist board was also working to ensure that “testing capacity in Portugal will meet the demand from tourists”.</p> <p>Portugal is critical for the tourist industry as it is the only major European travel destination on England's “green list” of 12 countries and territories for which a 10-day quarantine rule for returning visitors has been waived. </p> <p>Several of the others are barely inhabited, while hotspots including France and Spain are “amber”, meaning people returning must self-isolate at home for 10 days. </p> <p>The peak summer season is key to cash-strapped travel companies and airlines, and many laid on extra flights to Portugal in the past week. </p> <p>Tui, Europe's largest tour operator, said it had switched planes flying to the country from Boeing 737s to the larger Dreamliners to cope with demand.</p> <p>Jet2, the online travel agency and airline, said that it had seen bookings to Madeira and Faro, Portugal's main tourist airport, increase 600 per cent in the 24 hours after the green list announcement. </p> <p>“The discussions and decisions on whether countries will allow visitors in, despite them being on the ‘green list' are incredibly complex, and the speculation around these decisions creates a lot of anxiety and distress for both consumers and our travel agent members,” said Julia Lo Bue-Said, chief executive of travel agent group Advantage Travel Partnership</p> <p>Airlines had hoped to put on more planes to Israel, also on the “green list”. But they have instead been forced to cancel flights in recent days after the outbreak of violence in the region. Israel had intended to open up international travel for non-Israeli citizens from May 23.</p> <p>Virgin Atlantic is among the carriers to have cancelled flights to Tel Aviv this week, having earlier reported a 250 per cent week-on-week rise in bookings between London Heathrow and Tel Aviv. BA has cancelled flights until at least Monday. </p> <p>With days to go until the borders reopen, travel heads are also worried the threat of huge queues at airports will put people off booking. </p> <p>Holidaymakers have been warned to expect considerable delays at passport control, as electronic passport gates have been shut and Border Force officers are manually checking each passenger entering the country.</p> <p>Border staffing is at its highest level since 2012, according to government officials, but on some occasions queues have reached more than six hours at Heathrow with only a fraction of the normal number of people flying.</p> <p>Heathrow, the UK's busiest airport, has threatened to divert planes to other airports this summer if queues become too long. </p> <p>But Border Force officials maintain major queues have been caused by airlines allowing people to travel without the right documentation, and the UK aviation regulator has handed out more than 600 fines to carriers over the issue. </p> <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/249a2ab9-d5ac-409d-8adf-6b03553d342e.html?FTCamp=engage/CAPI/cs/Channel_Amana//B2B\"></a><p>Source: Philip Georgiadis and Alice Hancock in London and Peter Wise in Lisbon 2021 'Portugal to welcome British visitors from Monday in boost to tourism industry' FT.com 14 May.
