  "text": "<p>The creation of Mr. Fava's office was required by a settlement last year between Boeing and shareholders, who had sued the company's board related to its oversight of the 737 MAX's development and two crashes of the jet.</p><p>The role is aimed at providing an additional channel for Boeing employees who act on behalf of air-safety regulators to raise concerns, such as over transparency or undue pressure from management. Those employees perform various roles related to safety approvals and reviews on behalf of the FAA.</p><p>The role of such employees has been a focus of regulators and lawmakers since the two MAX accidents in 2018 and 2019 that claimed 346 lives.</p><p>The Boeing spokesman said Mr. Fava understands aerospace operations, regulatory and engineering matters, and that his appointment was among changes the company has undertaken over the past two years to strengthen its safety practices and culture.</p><p>License this article from Dow Jones Reprint Service</p>",
