  "title": "Allegiant Air to Buy 50 Boeing 737 MAX Jets; Agreement adds a U.S. customer for Boeing and provides an option for the carrier to buy 50 additional planes",
  "text": "<p>Allegiant's purchase will see Boeing adding a U.S. customer, winning business from an airline whose current fleet comprises aircraft built by Airbus SE. Allegiant now exclusively flies Airbus A319s and A320s, models that have been a longtime rival to Boeing's 737s.</p><p>Competition from European rival Airbus helped spur Boeing to create its MAX series, an update to the manufacturer's decades-old 737 program. Design decisions meant to maintain commonality with earlier 737 models led Boeing to introduce a computer-based flight-control mode that investigators have blamed for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>Since then, the system has been redesigned. In 2020, the FAA and global regulators lifted a ban on the aircraft type that had lasted more than a year.</p><p>The groundings led customers to cancel hundreds of orders, although sales of the 737 MAX picked up again last year.</p><p>Still, other customers have moved away from Boeing, with Dutch carrier KLM and Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd. signing orders with Airbus last monthto buy hundreds of A320s.</p><p>The deal also represents a strategic milestone for Allegiant, an airline that has previously focused on buying used aircraft to operate its point-to-point routes largely focused on bringing tourists to leisure destinations.</p><p>\"The pandemic recovery cycle has brought to Allegiant unique opportunities to acquire new equipment,\" the airline said.</p><p>Allegiant cited the MAX's fuel efficiency and cabin features as factors in its decision.</p><p>Allegiant Air to Buy 50 Boeing 737 MAX Jets</p>",
