  "text": "<p>In March, Boeing warned Spirit AeroSystems about suspected problems with parts at MPS and asked it to use alternative suppliers as it continued an audit of the Italian company's operations, according to a letter seen by Reuters.</p><p>It also asked Wichita-based Spirit to trace any MPS parts it had used back to 2017 and to treat them as \"suspect nonconforming,\" meaning they would be subject to further checks.</p><p>\"Out of an abundance of caution while Boeing conducts further testing and evaluation, Boeing has also decided to consider all product processed by MPS to be suspect,\" it said.</p><p>Boeing and Spirit had no immediate comment on the letter. Boeing said earlier the problems did not pose any immediate safety issues to 787 Dreamliners already in service.</p><p>Brindisi, Italy-based MPS, a coatings supplier, did not respond to phone calls and an emailed request for comment.</p><p>MPS is also an approved supplier to Airbus , according to a list available via the planemaker's website.</p><p>A spokesperson for the European company had no immediate comment when asked whether it or its suppliers had recently used any parts involving work carried out by MPS.</p>",
