  "title": "U.S. News: Hefty Wall Street Fines Surge Under Biden's SEC",
  "text": "<p>Defense attorneys say the SEC has leverage to ratchet up fines when it wants; brokerages and asset managers don't want to litigate with the agency that directly supervises them. Most large public companies also elect to settle SEC claims of misconduct rather than wage long court battles that carry legal, political and business risks.</p><p>In its 2022 fiscal year, the SEC levied $2.2 billion in fines against exchange-listed companies, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. That amount dwarfs what the penalties the commission imposed in recent years, according to data from the NYU Pollack Center for Law &amp; Business and Cornerstone Research. In 2018, for instance, the SEC imposed about $1.2 billion in fines against exchange-listed companies, NYU and Cornerstone data show.</p><p>\"The robust penalties levied this year are designed to deter and reduce securities violations, and should not be seen as an acceptable cost of doing business,\" the SEC's enforcement director, Gurbir Grewal, said. He added that the agency plans to soon release its year-end enforcement results, which he said would likely confirm a year-over-year increase in total penalties.</p><p>The biggest U.S. and European banks account for many of the past year's largest fines, with nine of them shelling out $125 million each to settle claims that employees used prohibited messaging applications, such as WhatsApp, to conduct business. (They also paid at least $75 million to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which undertook a similar investigation.)</p><p>The widespread use of text-messaging, sometimes on personal devices the banks didn't monitor, violated SEC rules that require securities dealers to keep most business records for at least three years, regulators said. The SEC's five commissioners voted unanimously to approve the settlements over unapproved text-messaging use.</p><p>Mr. Grewal has said the failures were especially serious because missing records undermine the SEC's ability to investigate wrongdoing. SEC officials insisted that every bank pay $125 million despite arguments from defense attorneys that prohibited texting was less prevalent at some firms than others, according to several attorneys involved in the cases. Two smaller brokerage firms paid at least $80 million to settle similar claims with the SEC and CFTC, while another paid $16 million.</p><p>Several other companies also paid fines exceeding $100 million last year. Charles Schwab &amp; Co. paid a $135 million fine to resolve an SEC investigation that found it didn't adequately disclose to clients the downside of keeping a big share of their assets in cash. Boeing Co. paid $200 million over allegations that it made misleading statements about the safety risks of its 737 MAX jets after two of the planes crashed. And Barclays PLC paid a $200 million fine to resolve claims that it raised $17.7 billion from investors in debt sales that weren't properly registered with the SEC.</p><p>The Journal's analysis looked at companies with shares listed on U.S. exchanges and didn't include enforcement actions against private companies or firms with securities traded only over the counter, which in most cases result in lower fines. It also didn't examine how much companies paid in disgorgement, or profits they gave back that stemmed from wrongdoing. The SEC has more discretion to determine penalties than disgorgement, which courts have said must be limited to the amount of a defendant's illegal profits.</p><p>The biggest SEC fine levied during the past fiscal year was a $675 million penalty against Allianz Global Investors U.S. LLC, which was accused of misleading investors in 17 private-investment funds. Allianz SE's shares aren't listed on a U.S. stock exchange.</p><p>Congress in 1990 gave the SEC the authority to seek fines in federal court and to impose them through its own in-house proceedings. Monetary sanctions have risen since the 2008 financial crisis, when regulators were blamed for missing problems that contributed to the economic catastrophe and the failures of several investment banks. The high-water mark for penalties from 2010 to 2021 was $1.4 billion in 2018, according to SEC figures.</p><p>The SEC didn't name or sue any individuals in the messaging cases. The record-keeping law applies to companies and not to individuals, according to lawyers involved in the cases.</p><p>---</p><p>Theo Francis contributed to this article.</p>",
