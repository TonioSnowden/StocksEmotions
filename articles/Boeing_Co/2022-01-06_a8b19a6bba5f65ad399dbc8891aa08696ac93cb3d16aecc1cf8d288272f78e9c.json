  "text": "<p>There must be something in the Perrier. French storytellers have suddenly taken Gallic existentialism into fabulist territory, albeit one with fine wine and nice decor.&#xa0;</p> <p>In Antoine Laurain's recent novel&#xa0;<em>Vintage 1954,</em>&#xa0;the residents of a grand Parisian townhouse are transported back to the era of Edith Piaf courtesy of a bottle of Beaujolais, while in Céline Sciamma's beguiling new film&#xa0;<em>Petit Maman</em>, a young girl befriends her own eight-year-old mother. And now Hervé Le Tellier takes a flight of fancy with&#xa0;<em>The&#xa0;Anomaly</em>, a tale of transcendent turbulence, copied souls and more than a dash of <em>l'amour fou</em>, which won the 2020 Prix Goncourt, France's most prestigious literary prize. </p> <p>This novel's premise reads like a high-concept Hollywood pitch. An Air France flight from Paris to New York lands at JFK airport in March 2021, carrying 230 passengers, having barrelled through a terrifying storm. Three months later, it lands again. The same Boeing 787, the same passengers, at the end of the same white-knuckle journey. The CIA concludes that the duplicating mechanism was a monstrous cumulonimbus on the eastern seaboard of the US. The result: two sets of the same people.</p> <p>The passenger manifest allows for an amusing cast of doubles. They include André Vannier, a successful 60-something architect with a huge Haussmann apartment, and his younger girlfriend Lucie Bogaert, a film editor and single mother with a penchant for emotionally detached sex. There is Blake, a hitman who runs a vegetarian restaurant, and Slimboy, a gay Nigerian Afro-rapper. Among the Americans, there is a traumatised child and a corporate lawyer. And then there is Victor Miesel, a world-weary French novelist, who observes: “Nobody lives long enough to know just how little interest anybody takes in anybody.”</p> <p>Miesel's twin incarnations allow for some digs at the Parisian publishing scene. Following the first flight, he writes a Camus-inflected metaphysical bestseller called&#xa0;<em>The&#xa0;anomaly</em>&#xa0;— the lower case “a” is left unexplained — and then throws himself off his balcony. Achieving success this late in the game is “a little like finally being served the mustard when you're on to dessert,” notes his editor. But the second Victor delights in his semi-posthumous fame. It even reignites his love life.</p> <p>Differing reactions to the phenomenon provide much of the comedy. The Americans look to the Bible and the gun rack for remedies, while in France the intelligentsia debate the situation on television, this being “a country with a legendary concentration of media-savvy philosophers.”&#xa0;Religious leaders, politicians, mathematicians and various intelligence agencies all propose conflicting theories about the event, ranging from an act of God to terrorism. The most likely, however, is also the most troubling: that the duplicated flight represents a scratch in the veneer of reality, that humanity is living within a simulation.&#xa0;</p> <p>The second set of passengers is initially held in a military hangar, allowing the authorities to observe the “shifting anxieties in the outsized Petri dish”. Le Tellier ponders what any of us would do if faced with our mirror self. His characters provide a variety of answers. The time-lag between the landings allows for separations, revelations and deaths to have occurred in the interim, creating unusual personal and practical issues. Can two wives share a husband? Should André rename his architectural firm Vannier, Vannier &amp; Edelman?</p> <p>In its stock-take of the virtues of the real versus the virtual, the novel flirts with the current debate on the validity of the so-called metaverse. But it does so with the lightest of touches. Le Tellier juggles the theoretical and the comical with dexterity.&#xa0;Likewise, Adriana Hunter's fluid translation neatly switches between French and American banter, the personal and the universal, disparate characters and contrary timelines.</p> <p>The novel's unpredictable delivery — which includes song lyrics, interview transcripts&#xa0;and some haphazard typography&#xa0;— is guided by Le Tellier's longtime fascination with structural forms. Since 1992, he has been a member of the French cultural group Oulipo (Ouvroir de Littérature Potentielle) which encourages the use of artificial writing constraints and rules to reach new expressive heights.</p> <p>Le Tellier's previous novels have played with the idea of boundaries, touching on subjects such as cryptology and infidelity. He used dominoes as the guiding principle behind the plot of&#xa0;<em>Enough About Love</em>&#xa0;and created a narrative fresco out of a series of brief erotic stories in&#xa0;<em>The Sextine Chapel</em>.</p> <p>While his backlist is somewhat rarefied,&#xa0;<em>The&#xa0;Anomaly</em>&#xa0;has made Le Tellier a sensation in France,&#xa0;where it&#xa0;has already sold more than a million copies. Its Prix Goncourt success highlights the difference between the European and anglophone book worlds. A novel this playful — like an episode of&#xa0;<em>The Twilight Zone</em>&#xa0;co-written by René Descartes and Mel Brooks — would be an unusual contender for the resolutely sober Booker Prize. The French, however, remain unapologetic in their appreciation of a spirited cocktail of magical thinking, whimsical ennui and matters of the heart. Le Tellier's addition to this growing sub-genre is intoxicating.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0241540488?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=finantimes-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;creativeASIN=0241540488\"><strong>The&#xa0;Anomaly</strong></a> by Hervé Le Tellier, translated from the French by Adriana Hunter, <em>Michael Joseph £14.99, 336 pages/Other Press $16.99, 400 pages</em></p> <p><em>Join our online book group on Facebook at&#xa0;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/139838140082304/\"><em>FT Books Café</em></a></p><p>Source: Christian House 2022 'The Anomaly by Hervé Le Tellier — playful flight into the unknown ' FT.com 6 January.
