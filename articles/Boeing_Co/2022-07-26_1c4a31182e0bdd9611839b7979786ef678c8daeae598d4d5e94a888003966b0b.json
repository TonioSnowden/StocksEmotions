  "text": "<p>The Boston-based conglomerate is in the process of splitting into three companies, starting with a planned spinoff of its healthcare business in early 2023. GE projected what it described as a slight decline in the full-year profit outlook for its healthcare division, citing inflation as the primary driver.</p><p>Revenue in the company's aviation business surged 27% to $6.13 billion, making it the biggest and most profitable division, driven by demand for services and spare parts sales even as supply-chain problems reduced engine deliveries. The unit produces and repairs engines for Boeing Co. and Airbus SE; and GE said it expects demand to remain strong as travel rebounds after the pandemic.</p><p>Overall, GE reported a second-quarter loss of $648 million on continuing operations, widened from $626 million in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding items, GE said its adjusted earnings were 78 cents a share, compared with Wall Street's estimate of 42 cents a share. Revenue was $18.64 billion versus $18.25 billion a year ago. Analysts had projected $17.9 billion, according to S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p><p>Write to Theo Francis at theo.francis@wsj.com</p><p>GE Gets Lift From Aviation but Cuts Cash Flow Goals</p>",
