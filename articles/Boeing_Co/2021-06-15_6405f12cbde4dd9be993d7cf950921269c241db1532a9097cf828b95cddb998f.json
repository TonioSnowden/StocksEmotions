  "text": "<p>   Mr. Bernstein, Carnival's CFO, said the company will reduce its debt in coming years by paying off bonds and loans as they come due, using cash generated from operations. The goal, he said, is to reclaim the same investment-grade ratings that the company had before the pandemic. </p><p>   Boeing has said it will make debt reduction a priority once its cash flow becomes more normal. </p><p>   Some companies that borrowed money in the pandemic have already started to pay it back. </p><p>   Delta has said it expects to return to its investment-grade profile within two years. It paid down a $1.5 billion loan in March and said in April that it would repay $850 million of additional debt by the end of this quarter. </p><p>   \"What we're seeing is corporations make an active attempt to improve their balance sheets,\" said Matt Brill, senior portfolio manager and head of North American investment grade at the asset manager Invesco Ltd. \"And as long as we're seeing that, we're not going to be concerned.\" </p><p>   Still, he added, \"there is certainly an elevated level of debt that needs to be repaid.\" </p><p>   --- </p><p>   Kristin Broughton and Mark Maurer contributed to this article. </p><p></p>",
