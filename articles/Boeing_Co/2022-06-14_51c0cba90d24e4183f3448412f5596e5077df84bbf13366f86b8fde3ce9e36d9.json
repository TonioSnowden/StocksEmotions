  "title": "Caterpillar to Move Headquarters to Texas From Illinois; Construction equipment maker's move follows Boeing's decision to relocate to Arlington, Va., from Chicago",
  "text": "<p>\"We believe it's in the best strategic interest of the company to make this move,\" said Caterpillar Chief Executive Jim Umpleby.</p><p>The 97-year-old company was based in Peoria, Ill., for decades before shifting its headquarters in 2018 to Deerfield, Ill., a Chicago suburb. Caterpillar said it would begin moving its headquarters to Texas this year.</p><p>The move is expected to affect the roughly 230 corporate employees at the company's headquarters, Caterpillar said, a fraction of its total workforce of nearly 108,000. It is a setback for Chicago and Illinois leaders' efforts to bring more companies to the city and surrounding area, which has drawn the headquarters of Conagra Brands Inc., Archer Daniels Midland Co. and other companies in recent years.</p><p>Boeing Co. said in May that it would move its global headquarters to Arlington, Va., from Chicago. The plane maker's move aims to bring its leadership closer to federal officials and an engineering talent pool, with other major military contractors already based in the area.</p><p>Caterpillar had $51 billion in revenue in 2021, and its stock is part of the closely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p><p>Caterpillar continues to have many salaried employees based in Peoria as well as other factories in the state that make some of the company's largest mining trucks and tracked bulldozers. Caterpillar said it employs 17,000 employees in Illinois, including around 12,000 in the Peoria area, out of the approximately 44,000 in the U.S.</p><p>Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker voiced disappointment in Caterpillar's move and in a statement that the state continues to be a leader in attracting companies.</p><p>Manufacturers have increasingly turned to the Southwest as a destination for new factories. Caterpillar hosted an investor day in Dallas last month, saying that the energy transition would lead to higher revenue growth.</p><p>Texas in recent years has drawn the relocations of other major U.S. companies, including Tesla Inc., Oracle Corp. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., as well as newly founded startups. Companies have cited easier hiring and more-affordable real estate as reasons to expand operations in Texas.</p><p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has touted his state's low taxes and looser approach to business regulation, and Texas lawmakers have offered financial measures to lure employers from the coasts. Illinois has an individual income tax of 4.95%, while Texas doesn't have a state income tax.</p><p>Caterpillar said in 2017 that it would leave its longtime Peoria headquarters. That came as the company increasingly turned to global markets for sales and sought to attract top executive-level talent with the amenities of a major city like Chicago.</p><p>Write to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com</p><p>Caterpillar to Move Headquarters to Texas From Illinois</p>",
