  "text": "<p>On the afternoon of February 18, I made myself a cup of tea, lowered myself on to the couch and opened my laptop to watch a dear friend's appearance on television.</p> <p>My friend is captain Kirsten Molyneaux, and I, along with so many other people on the Friday of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1af0e4fd-72b6-419e-8c04-604309a6532c\">Storm Eunice</a>, was tuning in to live coverage of the landings at Heathrow airport. Kirsten and I have known each other for two decades — we met in the first hour of our pilot cadet course in 2001 — and as I followed her textbook landing with fascination and vicarious pride, I was reminded of the many years of experience and training that I was watching her deploy.</p> <p>The relationship between wind and an arriving aircraft is defined by the wind's strength and direction, and by how these parameters fluctuate. As this relationship can be as hard to visualise as air itself, I find it helpful to picture the wind as a wide, deep and changeable river — indeed, the science of aerodynamics is a branch of fluid dynamics — and the runway as a long rectangle that lies flat on the riverbed.</p> <p>For a headwind, imagine that this river is flowing straight along the runway, and that you are facing upstream as you land; your effective speed over the riverbed, then, will be lower, by an amount equal to the speed of the current. As a result, after touchdown you will demand less of your brakes and use less of the runway. This is why pilots prefer to land, and take off, in headwinds, and why runways are typically built to face them (a beguiling chart called a <a href=\"https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/wcc/home/climateSupport/windRoseResources/\">“wind rose”</a> assists the designers of new airports).</p> <p>In a tailwind, however, we are in effect landing downstream. Our speed over the riverbed is increased — it's the sum of our speed through the water and the speed of the water itself — and we require more braking and distance to stop. Aircraft therefore have strict tailwind landing limits — often 15 knots (17 mph), or less on shorter runways. When air traffic controllers helpfully switch the landing direction of a runway, they turn tailwinds into headwinds.</p> <p>The river analogy is particularly useful in illustrating the effect of a crosswind on landing. Picture the river — the wind — sweeping over the runway from ahead but also from the left, as it did on February 18 at Heathrow. If Kirsten had pointed her Airbus directly along the imaginary line that ran to the runway and down its centre-line, the wind would have immediately blown her off course to the right. Instead — employing the “crabbing” crosswind landing technique that she, my other colleagues and I have practised countless times in the simulator — she steered the nose of the jet to the left, into the wind, which allowed the aircraft to track directly towards the runway.</p> <p>In other words, her aeroplane was aiming in one direction while moving in another, a difference known as the “crab angle”. (Perhaps a maths teacher once asked you to calculate where to point yourself in order to cross a fast-flowing channel along a line perpendicular to its parallel banks; and perhaps, as well, you won't be surprised to learn that Kirsten, like many pilots, is a keen sailor.) Indeed, aircraft almost never move in the direction we point them — even when we're descending, we're usually tilted skywards — but the drift induced by strong crosswinds can be particularly dramatic.</p> <p>Just before a crosswind landing, the crab angle is reduced to ensure the aircraft touches the ground with its wheels roughly aligned with the direction of their motion over it. The pilot — in strong crosswinds the landing is always done manually — does this with the rudder, the moveable, nautically monikered panel at the back of the vertical, sail-like portion of the tail.</p> <p>At Heathrow on February 18, this required a substantial press on the right rudder — but only just before touchdown, because an aircraft will start to drift downwind as soon as this alignment is initiated. Aircraft have crosswind limits — 40 knots is a typical figure — determined, essentially, by the size of the rudder and its distance from the aircraft's centre of gravity. For this reason, air traffic controllers read out the latest wind to pilots who are about to land, and it's also displayed on our instrumentation. If the crosswind exceeds an aircraft's limits, pilots “go around” — we climb away, to await a change in the wind's speed or direction, or to divert to an airport with a runway that's more favourably aligned.</p> <p>The other challenge that winds present is their variability, both in speed and direction. In the final several thousand feet of an approach, pilots use their instruments, their eyes or a combination of the two to follow a steady, stable glidepath all the way down to the runway. (Picture a string running down at a shallow angle — three degrees is typical — until it meets the touchdown zone of the runway; indeed, some navigation aids helpfully project radio beams that form such a line.) When the wind shifts suddenly, pilots intuitively react to restore the aircraft to this perfect glide path. If such turbulence occurs near to the ground, however, a go-around is the simplest and safest option.</p> <p>Dramatic changes to low-level winds are known as windshear. Modern airliners have three windshear-related systems: the pilots themselves, who practise detecting and reacting to windshear conditions in the simulator as often as every six months; a system that senses sudden changes in the aircraft's overall energy; and a predictive system, which uses our weather radar to track the speed of water droplets or ice particles in the air ahead. When windshear is detected or predicted, an automatic callout sounds in the cockpit — “Windshear” or “Windshear Ahead” — and pilots fly a mandatory go-around. It's likely that some of the go-arounds on February 18 were induced by low-level turbulence, and others by temporary windshear conditions.</p> <p>As they landed, Kirsten's passengers burst into applause. After taxiing in and parking at Terminal 5, one of them — an Englishman in his late forties, about the same age as Kirsten and me — came up to the flight deck. He wanted to thank Kirsten and her first officer, and to show them a clip of their landing, recorded by his wife at home.</p> <p>Later, when I spoke to Kirsten, she told me that her workday wasn't anything we hadn't trained for in the simulator a hundred times. On the other hand, she added, she'd never before been given the opportunity to watch one of her own landings, and so the clip that her customer shared — of her descent to London through the gales of Storm Eunice, and her touchdown in conditions that captivated the world — is one she'll keep.</p> <p><em>Mark Vanhoenacker is a Boeing 787 pilot for British Airways and the author of ‘Skyfaring' and the forthcoming ‘Imagine a City' (Chatto &amp; Windus/Knopf)</em></p> <p><em>Follow Mark on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/markv747\"><em>@markv747</em></a><em> and email him at </em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&amp;tf=cm&amp;to=mark.vanhoenacker@ft.com\"><em>mark.vanhoenacker@ft.com</em></a></p> <p><em>Follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter to find out about our latest stories first</em></p><p>Source: Mark Vanhoenacker 2022 'Happy landings: how pilots tackle high winds' FT.com 7 March.
