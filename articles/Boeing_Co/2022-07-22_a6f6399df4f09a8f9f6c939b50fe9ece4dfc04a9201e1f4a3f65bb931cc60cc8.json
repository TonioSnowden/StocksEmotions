  "title": "U.S. Blacklists Former Paraguayan President Due to Alleged Corruption, Terrorism Ties; Horacio Cartes, who is blocked from entering the U.S., says accusations are baseless",
  "text": "<p>\"Former President Cartes obstructed a major international investigation into transnational crime in order to protect himself and his criminal associate from potential prosecution and political damage,\" Mr. Blinken said. Mr. Cartes also has ties to \"foreign terrorist organizations and other U.S.-designated entities which undermines the security of the United States,\" Mr. Blinken said without providing more details.</p><p>Two Paraguayan officials familiar with the matter said the U.S. took steps against Mr. Cartes after revelations that an aircraft formerly owned by an Iranian carrier that is blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury for alleged arms trafficking had transported cigarettes from a company owned by the former president.</p><p>Mr. Cartes's lawyer, Pedro Ovelar, said the former president wouldn't provide further comments after issuing a statement on Twitter denying wrongdoing. He hasn't been charged.</p><p>\"I reject the content of the accusations, which I consider baseless and unfair,\" Mr. Cartes wrote. \"We've always been and always will be willing to offer support and first-hand information that authorities need to clear up matters that we are questioned about.\"</p><p>Mr. Cartes's lawyer said he believes the accusations were motivated by the former president's opponents in Paraguay. He noted that Mr. Blinken's statement didn't mention a specific case of corruption.</p><p>Earlier this year, Paraguay's then-interior minister, Arnaldo Giuzzio, accused Mr. Cartes of laundering money and illicit enrichment tied to the alleged sale of contraband cigarettes from the former president's tobacco company, Tabacalera del Este SA, known as Tabesa. The assertions didn't lead to charges.</p><p>Last month, Paraguay's top anticorruption official, Rene Fernandez, called for a probe into allegations that Tabesa was linked to a group of Venezuelan and Iranian men who traveled through Paraguay in May. Paraguayan prosecutors are now investigating the men for alleged links to terrorism, though they have not been charged, government documents show.</p><p>Mr. Ovelar, who also represents a conglomerate of companies owned by Mr. Cartes, said Tabesa has no ties to the Venezuelan and Iranian men.</p><p>The group of 18 men, which included one member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, traveled to Paraguay on a Boeing 747 owned by Venezuela's state airline, according to a June 22 report from Mr. Fernandez's office. The jet had previously been managed by Mahan Airlines, the private Iranian carrier blacklisted by the U.S. Treasury.</p><p>The plane and its crew were grounded in Argentina last month, with authorities there saying they are investigating alleged terrorism ties.</p><p>Flight logs show that the jet reported carrying $754,000 worth of cigarettes sourced from Tabesa when they flew out from Paraguay en route to Aruba on May 16, according to the anticorruption office. Listed as the recipient of the cargo was Tabacos USA Inc., a Pennsylvania registered company also owned by Mr. Cartes.</p><p>\"The typology of the transaccion resembles a typical conduct for the laundering of assets,\" Mr. Fernandez said in the report last month.</p><p>Mr. Ovelar said Tabacos USA is the distributor of Tabesa's cigarettes in the Caribbean, but wasn't the final purchaser of the May merchandise. The final client paid for and organized the flight to transport the cargo, said Mr. Ovelar.</p><p>\"In no moment did Tabesa communicate with the owners or directors of this transportation company,\" Mr. Ovelar said. \"The connection was made through the buyer of the merchandise.\"</p><p>Paraguay, which borders Brazil and Argentina, has long been at the center of the illegal trade of contraband goods and drugs, according to security experts in the U.S. and Latin America.</p><p>The First Capital Command, the violent Brazilian cartel known as PCC, has increasingly used the country as a base for drug smuggling, Paraguayan security experts said. Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia designated as a terror group by the U.S., has used Paraguay's lawless border region with Brazil and Argentina to launder money, according to U.S. and Latin American security officials.</p><p>Battling these and other groups is risky. In May, a top organized crime prosecutor who had been investigating drug traffickers and money launderers was gunned down while on his honeymoon in Colombia.</p><p>Silvina Frydlewsky contributed to this article.</p><p>U.S. Blacklists Former Paraguayan President Due to Alleged Corruption, Terrorism Ties</p>",
