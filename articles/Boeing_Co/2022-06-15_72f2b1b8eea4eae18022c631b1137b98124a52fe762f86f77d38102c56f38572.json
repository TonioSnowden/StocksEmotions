  "title": "Boeing Appoints Liaison for Employees Who Work on Behalf of FAA; Mark Fava, a former airline operations official and Navy officer, will take on role created following Boeing legal settlement over 737 MAX",
  "text": "<p>The creation of Mr. Fava's office was required by a settlement last year between Boeing and shareholders, who had sued the company's board related to its oversight of the 737 MAX's development and two crashes of the jet.</p><p>The role is aimed at providing an additional channel for Boeing employees who act on behalf of air-safety regulators to raise concerns, such as over transparency or undue pressure from management. Those employees perform various roles related to safety approvals and reviews on behalf of the FAA.</p><p>The role of such employees who work in Boeing's Organization Designation Authorization, or ODA, unit has been a focus of regulators and federal lawmakers since the two MAX accidents in 2018 and 2019. The crashes claimed 346 lives.</p><p>The Boeing spokesman said Mr. Fava understands aerospace operations and regulatory and engineering matters, and that his appointment was among changes the company has undertaken over the past two years to strengthen its safety practices and culture.</p><p>Last month, Boeing's chief aerospace safety officer, Mike Delaney, outlined how the plane maker was putting in place new systems to manage safety risk, mine airline data for incipient operational problems and encourage employees to raise concerns about possible hazards. Mr. Fava will report to Mr. Delaney.</p><p>The Boeing spokesman said Mr. Fava has more than 35 years of aviation experience. In addition to commanding a naval aviation squadron, he also worked as a chief operations attorney for Delta Air Lines Inc.</p><p>Besides adding an ombudsperson, the company's 2021 settlement with shareholders included an agreement to include a director with safety expertise on the company's board.</p><p>The monetary portion of the $237.5 million agreement was to be paid to the corporation by board members' insurance providers.</p><p>Write to Andrew Tangel at Andrew.Tangel@wsj.com</p><p>Boeing Appoints Liaison for Employees Who Work on Behalf of FAA</p>",
