  "text": "<p>The moves come as GE is splitting itself into three separate public companies by early 2024 following years of restructuring under CEO Larry Culp, the first outsider to run the company. In the process, GE has overhauled manufacturing practices, sold off divisions, paid down debt and made divisions responsible for covering their own costs. Last November, Mr. Culp announced that GE would break up.</p><p>GE said there would be no layoffs related to the announcements; the company has about 3,000 workers in Massachusetts. GE's moves were reported earlier by the Boston Globe.</p><p>Opened in 1956, Crotonville is a 60-acre property that is half conference center, half retreat with residence halls, classroom buildings and restaurants, along with hiking trails and a helipad.</p><p>For decades, the site was famed for culling and cultivating leaders the company saw as its most valuable product. Jack Welch, GE's larger-than-life former chief executive who died in 2020, held his lecture sessions in \"The Pit,\" a large sunken auditorium where he coached the future CEOs of companies such as Boeing Co. and Home Depot Inc. Mr. Welch remade and expanded the campus during his two decades running GE.</p><p>In Crotonville's heyday, Mr. Welch and other GE bosses would visit nearly every month to lead programs for middle managers, customers and executives from other companies who wanted to learn the GE leadership magic. Mr. Culp has taught at Crotonville, but GE's slow transformation into a much smaller company had raised questions among investors and employees about Crotonville's future.</p><p>Under Mr. Culp, GE has adopted lean manufacturing practices, a management philosophy that seeks to cut waste and create a culture of continuous improvement. One aspect of the system is learning where the work actually happens, such as a factory floor, rather than a classroom that is separate from the company's operations.</p><p>\"When you're in a factory, when you're in a business and you're able to drive that type of improvement in that short a period of time,\" Mr. Culp said in an interview in early 2020, \"it is flat out addictive.\"</p><p>The downsizing of the Boston headquarters is the latest step away from the city that once wooed GE away from Connecticut with $145 million in financial incentives in exchange for bringing 800 jobs. GE scaled back plans for a shiny glass headquarters in 2019, selling the original property and returning the incentives to house a staff of about 250. The current headquarters is about 100,000 square feet, GE said.</p><p>Write to Thomas Gryta at Thomas.Gryta@wsj.com</p><p>GE Puts Famed Management Academy Up for Sale</p>",
