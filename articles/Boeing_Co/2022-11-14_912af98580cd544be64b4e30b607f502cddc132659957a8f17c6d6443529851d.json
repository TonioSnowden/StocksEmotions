  "text": "<p>Some of the questions I get asked about flying are timeless. Have I ever seen anything I can't explain? (No, but on winter nights the hours-long auroras can be downright eerie.) How do planes stay up? (Think of a wing's motion through the air as like that of a water-ski on a lake.) One frequent question, however, is more recent: what are pilots doing on their iPads?</p> <p>It's an excellent question, because the iPad represents the greatest change to my job since I started flying as a commercial pilot nearly two decades ago. It's made my job simpler and aviation more efficient.</p> <p>Well in advance of each flight, our iPads allow us to view details such as the number of free seats and route-specific customer feedback. We can message the cabin crew to discuss operational matters (perhaps a VIP or a large school group will be travelling, for example) or merely to share or seek recommendations for restaurants or excursions at our destination. Primarily, however, pilots use iPads as a library, an atlas, and a tool for flight planning, briefing and logging.</p> <p>An aircraft library is formed of dozens of manuals, documents and forms. Some, such as the operating manuals, technical descriptions and cargo-loading instructions, are specific to each aircraft type. Others contain more general information — everything from the formal definitions of turbulence to a planet's worth of oceanic radio frequencies. On the Boeing 747, these books, some individually thicker than a stack of a dozen iPads, were latched behind the doors of dedicated cockpit bookcases.</p> <p>Removing the paper versions in favour of an iPad-based library saves not only trees but fuel, and we can access any manual without unstrapping our seatbelt, removing our headset and climbing out of our seat. </p> <p>We often also use the iPad to prepare ahead of a flight. Before operating to new or challenging airports, for example, we may be required to watch an introductory video. I'm now able to do this from home or on my way to work on the train, rather than in a special audiovisual room at Heathrow, as in the old days. (If I forget my iPad, I can borrow one; the protective case of the loaned iPads is, however, a reproachful red.)</p> <p>And, of course, many of our documents are updated frequently, and always with great care. Notices used to be posted at the airport to flag each change, until it was time to update the manuals, when a team at Heathrow would drive from one aircraft to the next, swapping fresh manuals for old. Pilots would collect a thick stack of new pages to insert into their personal set of aircraft manuals at home. (I used to do this on the living-room floor, without music or television, to ensure I didn't make a mistake.) Today, we simply press a button.</p> <p>Our iPads also hold a navigation app, called Lido mPilot, which opens to a map of the world and that day's route across it. From that view we can zoom in to see airways, minimum altitudes, navigation beacons and the pleasingly sweeping isogonic lines that indicate magnetic variation. To display or remove layers of data or declutter the screen, we need only tap a button; and we can tap anywhere on the planet to see air traffic control frequencies, satellite phone numbers and local instructions and notices. </p> <p>Unlike on the globe I once spun in my childhood bedroom, cities, rivers and sea lanes are not marked. Just a handful of mountains are named, and even national boundaries (as opposed to those of Flight Information Regions, the true countries of the sky) appear only faintly. Thankfully, the navigation app overrides the iPad's auto-lock function, so our charts never blank at a critical moment. (I wish every cooking app did the same.)</p> <p>The navigation app also holds our airport-specific “plates”, as we used to call them when they took the form of thousands of tissue-thin sheets in on-board binders or in small booklets we would collect at Heathrow before each flight. The text and maps on the plates tell us everything we need to know to make an approach to the specific airfield, such as its opening hours, controller call signs and even local speed limits (both in the air and on the ground). On digital plates we can add our own notes, zoom in or out, or even highlight an anticipated taxi route and mark our expected parking position. And it's a joy — particularly on dark and stormy nights — to move seamlessly from one plate to the next with a simple tap, rather than having to turn physical pages, reorder loose sheets or struggle to re-aim the beam of the cockpit's chart light.</p> <p>The iPads additionally serve as a flight briefing and logging tool. Before every departure, a team of planners prepares a briefing pack. This contains everything pilots must know to fly from A to B at a specific time on a specific aircraft: maps that show areas of potential turbulence, wind, air temperature and optimum altitude data, the preliminary payload and fuel load and, most importantly, the sequence of airways, way points and navigation beacons that form our flight-planned route.</p> <p>Once upon a time, after a flight crew had met at the airport and introduced themselves, the next task was to print out and staple together perhaps a hundred sheets or more of this briefing pack. These days, we download them directly to our iPads (via another app, Lido mBriefing). Because electronic updates can be issued easily — and much closer to departure time — this also allows us to fly more efficient routes that better match the latest wind forecasts, as well as our latest payload, which can change significantly as last-minute passenger bookings and cargo are added. (A heavier plane might benefit from a different initial cruising altitude and therefore, since winds vary with altitude, perhaps an entirely different route.) After we've read through the pack together, the captain orders the final fuel load and we head out to the aircraft, where we confirm the fuel loading with — you guessed it — a fuel app.</p> <p>Legally, pilots are required to log the time and the fuel on board at departure, at various way points en route and on arrival, as well as any re-clearances by air traffic control. These notations used to be made on a printout of the route that could run to more than 20 pages. In July, however, the requirement to carry and complete a paper flight log was finally lifted.</p> <p>Today, we complete the log electronically and submit it after we've parked and disabled the iPad's aptly named airplane mode (all the live information we use during the flight comes via the aircraft's own systems). As for my pen — which lives in the separate little holder next to the front pocket that's been a feature of generations of pilots' white shirts — these days I may cross back and forth across the world without ever taking it out. But nostalgia comes easily to me, as to so many of my colleagues, and I'm not yet quite ready to leave it in the drawer of my desk at home.</p> <p><em>Mark Vanhoenacker is a Boeing 787 pilot for British Airways and the author of ‘Imagine a City' (Chatto &amp; Windus/Knopf)</em></p> <p><em>Follow Mark on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/markv747\"><em>@markv747</em></a><em> or email him at </em><a href=\"https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&amp;tf=cm&amp;to=mark.vanhoenacker@ft.com\"><em>mark.vanhoenacker@ft.com</em></a> </p> <p><em>Find out about our latest stories first — follow </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ftweekend?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"><em>@ftweekend</em></a><em> on Twitter</em></p> <p><strong>Letter in response to this article:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/86ba1613-e109-4fa2-88b0-a658bfbe92ae\"><em>If pilots rely on iPads, what happens if they crash? / From Morris Zand, Geneva, Switzerland</em></a></p><p>Source: Mark Vanhoenacker 2022 'Why the iPad is the pilot's new best friend' FT.com 14 November.
