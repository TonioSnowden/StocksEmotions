  "title": "Intel CFO Departure Is Latest In a Trend",
  "text": "<p>The announcement of his departure comes about eight months into the tenure of Chief Executive Patrick Gelsinger, who had left Intel after 30 years for another job in 2009 and most recently served as CEO of software company VMware Inc.</p><p>Since taking over as CEO, Mr. Gelsinger has worked to regain Intel's competitive advantage, including by pledging to invest up to $95 billion in new chip production in Europe and more than $20 billion in U.S. factories.</p><p>Other recent examples of CFOs departing after new CEOs arrive at large U.S. companies include Boeing Co. CFO Greg Smith exiting in July -- about 18 months after Dave Calhoun became the aircraft maker's chief executive -- and the departure of Tim Stone, Ford Motor Co.'s finance chief, which was announced the same day new CEO Jim Farley took over last October.</p><p>CFOs tend to change within two years after new CEOs take over at least half the time, said Cathy Logue, head of the CFO and financial practice group at recruiting firm Stanton Chase. Top executives come with their own vision for a company, often resulting in them bringing in a new CFO. \"The CEO and the CFO have to be working hand in glove,\" Ms. Logue said.</p>",
