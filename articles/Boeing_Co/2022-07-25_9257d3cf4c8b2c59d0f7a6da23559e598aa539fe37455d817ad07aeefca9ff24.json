  "text": "<p>* The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA rose 71 points, or 0.2%, to 31,970.</p><p>* The S&amp;P 500 SPX was up 6 points, or 0.2%, at 3,968.</p><p>* The Nasdaq Composite COMP shed 40 points, or 0.3%, to 11,794.</p><p>Last week, the Dow rose 2%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.6% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 3.3%.</p><p>What's driving markets</p><p>Traders were positive early on Monday, though appeared reluctant to build bold positions before a big batch of corporate earnings, which could shape market sentiment in the short term.</p><p>For the new week, there will be 175 S&amp;P 500 companies reporting, including big beasts like Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN, though the action doesn't pick up again until Tuesday.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 was down 16.9% for the year to date through Friday but had climbed 8% from its 52-week low hit in mid-June, with sentiment underpinned of late by a corporate reporting season that has proved better than some had feared.</p><p>\"Earnings optimism is overshadowing recession fears that dragged stocks lower on Friday,\" said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index.</p><p>See: Bear-market bottom for U.S. stocks? What the pros say as S&amp;P 500 tests 4,000</p><p>With 21% of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported, the second quarter blended earnings growth rate for the benchmark index is 4.8%, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.</p><p>\"If 4.8% is the actual growth rate for the quarter, it will mark the lowest earnings growth rate reported by the index since Q4 2020 (4.0%),\" Butters said. However, \"68% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported a positive EPS surprise and 65% of S&amp;P 500 companies have reported a positive revenue surprise,\" he added.</p><p>The market's forward 12-month P/E ratio is 16.7, below the 10-year average of 17.0, according to FactSet, a pullback that is supporting valuations.</p><p>Earnings Watch: Here are 5 things we've learned since second-quarter earnings season kicked off</p><p>The looming Federal Reserve rate decision on Wednesday provided another reason for caution. The central bank is expected to raise borrowing costs by 75 basis points to a range of 2.25% to 2.50%, but investors will be keen to hear about how the Fed sees the pace of future hikes.</p><p>\"The pace of hikes remains uncertain as we get into the fall. If labor market data starts to soften we can expect the Fed's attention to once again switch to its dual mandate. But if inflation remains stubbornly high, then the Fed may continue to hike even if a recession is imminent,\" said Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management.</p><p>\"This uncertainty is likely to keep volatility elevated. The stock market is likely to remain range bound until the Fed pivots, or we get a reacceleration in business activity,\" Marcelli wrote in a note.</p><p>Read: Will the Federal Reserve snuff out a stock-market bounce?
