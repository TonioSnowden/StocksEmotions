  "title": "NASA's Artemis Launch Postponed Due to Engine Problem on Moon Rocket; Agency says it needs time to determine why one of the rocket's engines wasn't able to get to a temperature range needed to attempt liftoff",
  "text": "<p>The next available opportunity for takeoff is Friday, Sept. 2, starting at 12:48 p.m. ET, according to Derrol Nail, the space agency's commentator on its livestream for Monday's now delayed launch. But attempting the flight then will depend on what engineers determine is the issue with the engine and come up with a plan to remedy it, he added.</p><p>\"We must wait to see what shakes out,\" he said. The agency didn't immediately have a comment.</p><p>Photos: A Preview of NASA's Artemis Moon Mission</p><p>There are four engines on the main stage of the Space Launch System rocket, and the other three were functioning as expected, according to NASA's livestream. Teams from the agency were focused on an issue that was preventing one engine from reaching a temperature range that would permit launch. The launch countdown clock was paused at 40 minutes until a prospective launch.</p><p>NASA had previously set a two-hour window to take off this morning beginning at 8:33 a.m ET.</p><p>Large crowds were expected for the launch. A local tourism organization predicted that up to 200,000 people would visit Brevard County, where the Kennedy launch complex is located, to watch the rocket try to roar off the launchpad. Area businesses posted signs wishing the mission well: one bar offered a \"moonshot\" for $6.</p><p>The mission, officially called Artemis I, is the first major test of most of the main components that NASA and aerospace companies have been developing to help return astronauts to the lunar surface. No astronauts have reached the moon since 1972, but NASA aims through its Artemis program to make that happen as soon as 2025.</p><p>There are risks: NASA estimated a 1 in 125 chance that the Orion vehicle could be lost because of a problem during Artemis I. The probability of that loss is higher during the ascent phase of the flight than the re-entry and landing sequence, a spokeswoman said.</p><p>.</p><p>NASA and the contractors behind Artemis I and subsequent Artemis missions have faced pressure to get to the launchpad after grappling with technical setbacks that led to cost overruns and delays.</p><p>The inspector general at NASA has estimated the Artemis I launch would cost $4.1 billion in production and operational expenses, as would each of the following three flights. The inspector general has described that per-flight cost as unsustainable. NASA officials have said they are pushing to find cost savings and that the expenses for each mission would fall as more are launched.</p><p>Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman Corp. and other contractors involved in the effort said their companies have taken steps to cut costs.</p><p>Monday's flight is designed as a precursor to Artemis II, a mission planned for 2024 that would take astronauts on board the Orion spacecraft around the moon and back. A year later, the Artemis III mission would deliver four astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft to lunar orbit, where two would transfer to a lander that Elon Musk's SpaceX is now developing and then descend to the lunar surface.</p><p>Ultimately, the agency wants to create a permanent presence on the lunar surface and push on to Mars.</p><p>Write to Micah Maidenberg at micah.maidenberg@wsj.com</p><p>NASA's Artemis Launch Postponed Due to Engine Problem on Moon Rocket</p>",
