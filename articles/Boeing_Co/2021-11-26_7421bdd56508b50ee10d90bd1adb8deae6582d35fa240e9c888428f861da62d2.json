  "title": "New Covid-19 Travel Restrictions Rattle Airline Industry, Hit Shares; U.K., Singapore, Japan and other countries tighten rules on incoming passengers from southern Africa",
  "text": "<p>The new travel bans are limited to flights from a handful of countries that typically encompass a relatively low percentage of international travel. Still, global airline shares fell amid worry that the variant could take hold elsewhere and trigger broader travel restrictions just as many parts of the world start to fly again.</p><p>The European Union, the U.K., Singapore and Japan were among governments that moved to restrict flights and travelers from the region entering their borders. In the U.S., White House officials have been discussing potential travel curbs on southern African countries and are expected to meet with agency officials this afternoon to make a recommendation, people familiar with the matter said.</p><p>Shares in all three of the largest U.S. international airlines were down by more than 10% in morning trading. Shares of International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, the owner of British Airways and Spain's Iberia, were down by more than 15% in late European trading.</p><p>The selling spread to airline makers and their suppliers. Boeing Co. shares were down more than 7%, while shares of rival Airbus SE had shed more than 10% late in the day in Europe.</p><p>Experts from the World Health Organization were due to meet Friday to decide whether to declare the new strain—currently known as B.1.1.529—a \"variant of concern.\" The WHO uses this label for virus strains proved to be more contagious, lead to more serious illness or decrease the effectiveness of public-health measures, tests, treatments or vaccines. Other variants of concern include the Delta variant that is now dominant world-wide and the Alpha variant that drove a deadly wave of infections across Europe and the U.S. last winter and spring.</p><p>The European Union said it would propose an \"emergency brake\" on travel between South Africa, a handful of neighboring countries and the 27-member bloc. On Friday, Singapore's health ministry said it would restrict arrivals and transit for nonresidents who have traveled within 14 days to Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, starting Sunday.</p><p>The U.K. on Thursday placed six southern African states on its \"red list\" of countries from which travelers have to quarantine in government-approved hotels. It went a step further Friday and halted all commercial and private passenger flights to and from those countries for two days, from midday Friday.</p><p>Travel restrictions vary by country, but governments typically try to restrict flights taking off from affected countries or passengers who had passed through those nations recently.</p><p>Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd., which operates daily services between London's Heathrow airport and Johannesburg, said it would review its schedule of flights to South Africa over the next week to adapt to the changes. The carrier had planned to restart a direct route to Cape Town on Dec. 17. British Airways, which had been ramping up its routes to both cities, said it was working through plans to assist customers currently in the region.</p><p>The new rules mark another setback for long-haul carriers, which have been boosting capacity on international flights in recent weeks. The U.S. reopened its borders to noncitizens from dozens of countries earlier this month.</p><p>A spokesman for Lufthansa, which flies between Germany and South Africa 17 times a week, said it was continuing its flights to help German travelers return home and to maintain cargo transport. The airline hasn't made any changes to its schedule at the moment, the spokesman said, adding that it was too early to determine the impact of restrictions on travel demand.</p><p>In Hong Kong—which has one of the strictest on-arrival quarantine requirements in the world—genome-sequencing analysis confirmed two cases of the new variant among people already in hotel quarantine, the city's health department said Thursday. Health officials have further isolated 12 people who were in hotel rooms near the two cases. No related cases have been detected so far, they said.</p><p>Japan also tightened restrictions Friday on travel from South Africa and neighboring countries. Effective from Saturday, all travelers arriving in Japan from the region must spend 10 days in a government-designated hotel or other lodging facility and undergo testing every three or four days, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said. Until now, people permitted to enter Japan from those nations have been allowed to quarantine at home.</p><p>Peter Landers in Tokyo and Doug Cameron and Alison Sider in Chicago contributed to this article.</p><p>Write to Benjamin Katz at ben.katz@wsj.com and Natasha Khan at natasha.khan@wsj.com</p><p>New Covid-19 Travel Restrictions Rattle Airline Industry, Hit Shares</p>",
